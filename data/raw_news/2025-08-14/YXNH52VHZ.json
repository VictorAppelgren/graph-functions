  "title": "Mamdani points to Bronx population loss as proof NYC\u2019s affordability crisis during his anti-Trump tour",
  "description": "Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, visited a small business in the Bronx to attack Trump's tax policies while connecting the president to his rival candidate, Andrew Cuomo.",
  "content": "New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani traveled uptown to the Bronx on Thursday for the fourth day of his \"Five Boroughs Against Trump\" tour, arguing that President Donald Trump's administration is hurting small businesses.\n\n\"We are here today on the fourth stop of our five borough tour, to speak about how Bronx sites can not afford the city that they call home, Mamdani said. \"That is a struggle that many residents of the Bronx feel individually. It's also a struggle that I know our small businesses are feeling at this moment. From 2020 to 2022, the population of the Bronx dropped by 6.3%. That's more than any other borough in New York City. People are leaving this further, leaving this city because it's too expensive. We are the most expensive city in the United States of America.\"\n\nThroughout the week, Mamdani has connected Trump to his leading competitor in the race, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who lost the Democratic primary to Mamdani in June and is now running as an independent candidate.\n\nThe theme continued on Thursday as the Mamdani campaign visited Nohble, a small business in the Bronx, where he argued that both Trump and Cuomo have handed \"tax breaks to billionaires and megacorporations\" throughout their political careers. Meanwhile, Mamdani has made affordability the central message of his campaign.\n\nTrump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" which narrowly passed Congress last month, has been widely celebrated by Republicans for extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts and adding deductions on tipped wages and overtime, while reducing spending on Medicaid and clean energy and strengthening border security.\n\nMAMDANI TAKES AIM AT TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POLICIES IN FIERY STATEN ISLAND SPEECH: 'WE ARE FIGHTING TO KEEP NYC A SANCTUARY CITY'\n\nBut Democrats have been quick to claim that Trump's megabill handed tax breaks to the wealthy while cutting benefits to the most vulnerable \u2013 a key Democratic message ahead of competitive midterm elections expected in 2026.\n\nWhile Republicans argue the bill only cuts waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), about 10 million more people will be uninsured by 2034 due to Trump's mega-bill.\n\nAs national Democrats slam Trump's tax breaks, Mamdani has criticized Cuomo's own record as governor, which includes offering $3 billion in tax breaks for the failed Amazon HQ2 deal in Queens, expanding $420 million-a-year film industry credits and launching \"Tax-Free NY\" zones to give businesses 10 years without state taxes.\n\nThroughout the week, Mamdani has criticized Cuomo following The New York Times report that Trump spoke on the phone with Cuomo about how to defeat Mamdani in November. Meanwhile, Mamdani has described how his administration would be Trump's \"worst nightmare.\"\n\n\"As we see Donald Trump and Andrew Cuomo trip over themselves to reward those who already have a fortune, we will stand up and fight for those that have been forgotten,\" Mamdani said on Staten Island on Wednesday at an anti-Trump event focused on immigration.\n\nTrump made waves on the 2024 presidential campaign trail when he held a rally in the Bronx and then visited a local barber shop in the borough.\n\nThe focus on deep blue New York City was seen as politically unusual for a Republican candidate, but Trump spent weeks in New York City for his criminal trial and often used the Big Apple as his own personal campaign trail.\n\nDuring the rally, Trump vowed to \"turn New York City around,\" promising to make the city \"bigger, better and greater than ever before.\"\n\nThe Republican candidate also spoke with voters at Knockout Barbershop in the Bronx, taking questions from locals grappling with economic hardship.\n\n\"We see far too many parallels between Donald Trump and Andrew Cuomo, far too many stories that make clear that both administrations have been characterized by corruption, by a sense of impunity, by an inability of an executive to understand that no means no, a prioritization of the interests of billionaires over working people, and an agenda that is driven by little else beyond the retention and accumulation of power,\" Mamdani said on Monday in Manhattan.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's comment request, but said on Monday, ahead of Mamdani's first anti-Trump event, \"The American people have repeatedly rejected this Communist agenda and the more Mamdani shares his radical policies, the more the American people will recoil.\"",

He argues that President Donald Trump's administration is hurting small businesses and points out that the Bronx population has dropped by 6.3% from 2020 to 2022 due to high costs. Mamdan has also connected Trump to his competitor, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is now running as an independent candidate.

      "text": "Amazon announced Thursday it was turning back on its plans to build its second headquarters in New York City, the company said in a statement. The move comes after backlash from lawmakers, notably Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who bemoaned the project.\n\"After much thought and deliberation, we\u2019ve decided not to move forward with our plans to build a headquarters for Amazon in Long Island City, Queens,\" the Seattle-based Amazon said in the release.\n\"For Amazon, the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive, collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long-term. While polls show that 70% of New Yorkers support our plans and investment, a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project we and many others envisioned in Long Island City,\" the statement reads.\nOCASIO-CORTEZ CHEERS AS AMAZON REPORTEDLY RECONSIDERS NY HQ AFTER FIERCE OPPOSITION\nThe company added that it is \"disappointed to have reached this conclusion.\"\n\"We are deeply grateful to Governor Cuomo, Mayor de Blasio, and their staffs, who so enthusiastically and graciously invited us to build in New York City and supported us during the process,\" the company continued in the statement.\nIn a statement provided to Fox News, de Blasio said that New York City gave Amazon an opportunity and it \"threw away that opportunity.\"\n\"You have to be tough to make it in New York City. We gave Amazon the opportunity to be a good neighbor and do business in the greatest city in the world,\" de Blasio said in the statement. \"Instead of working with the community, Amazon threw away that opportunity. We have the best talent in the world and every day we are growing a stronger and fairer economy for everyone. If Amazon can\u2019t recognize what that\u2019s worth, its competitors will.\u201d\nOcasio-Cortez tweeted that \"anything is possible,\" taking a victory lap upon hearing the news.\nBankrate.com's senior economic analyst Mark Hamrick called it a \"stunning development,\" adding: \"For those who didn\u2019t want Amazon to bring the promised 25,000 new jobs and added economic vitality to the area: Be careful what you wish for.\"\nAMAZON EXECS GRILLED, JEERED AT NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL HEARING OVER HQ2\nThe opposition against HQ2 has been mounting in recent months. In December, for example, Amazon execs were grilled and jeered at a New York City Council meeting over the deal.\nEarlier this month, reports surfaced that Amazon was reconsidering its plans for its New York office, which led to cheers from Ocasio-Cortez. \"Can everyday people come together and effectively organize against creeping overreach of one of the world\u2019s biggest corporations? Yes, they can,\" the freshman lawmaker tweeted.\nOcasio-Cortez has also slammed the company for having bias in its facial recognition technology.\nAMAZON'S NEW YORK HQ2 CANCELLATION DRAWS FIERY RESPONSES FROM LAWMAKERS, TECH WORLD\nIn a statement, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo expressed his frustration over Amazon's nixed New York City headquarters. \"Bringing Amazon to New York diversified our economy away from real estate and Wall Street, further cementing our status as an emerging center for tech and was an extraordinary economic win not just for Queens and New York City, but for the entire region, from Long Island to Albany's nanotech center,\" he said. \"However, a small group politicians put their own narrow political interests above their community -- which poll after poll showed overwhelmingly supported bringing Amazon to Long Island City -- the state's economic future and the best interests of the people of this state. The New York State Senate has done tremendous damage. They should be held accountable for this lost economic opportunity.\"\nAmazon said it would proceed as planned with the second part of its HQ2, which will be built in Northern Virginia, as well as its distribution center that it said it would open in Nashville. It will also continue to \"hire and grow across our 17 corporate offices and tech hubs in the U.S. and Canada.\"\nThe deal was greeted with much fanfare when it was announced last year and was lauded as a major economic boost.\nTENNESSEE 'VERY INTERESTED' IN AMAZON HQ2 AFTER NYC STRIFE\nCuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had touted the benefits of Amazon's HQ2, which included a pledge from the tech giant to create 25,000 jobs, paying an average of $150,000 per year in exchange for a slew of city and state tax breaks and subsidies worth up to $3 billion.\nIn addition to the 25,000 jobs, Amazon would've brought $2.5 billion in Amazon investment and eventually 8 million square feet of office space to Long Island City as part of its investment announced last November. The Seattle-based company said it would have generated \"incremental tax revenue of more than $10 billion over the next 20 years as a result of Amazon\u2019s investment and job creation.\"\nAccording to a December Quinnipiac University poll, 57 percent of New York City residents support Amazon\u2019s arrival in the region, compared to just 26 percent who oppose the deal, Fox Business previously reported.\nAMAZON CANCELED NYC HQ 'LIKE A PETULANT CHILD,' LOCAL POLITICIAN SAYS\nAmazon faced fierce opposition over the tax breaks it was offered in New York, with critics complaining that the project was an extravagant giveaway to one of the world's biggest companies and that it wouldn't provide much direct benefit to most New Yorkers.\n\"This announcement marks a landmark victory for our communities and shows the power of the people, even when taking on the world's richest man,\" said Deborah Axt, co-executive director of the anti-poverty group Make the Road New York.\nShe said the Amazon was getting \"taxpayer giveaways\" so that it could \"force its empire-building on our neighborhoods.\"\nThere had also been concerns about what Amazon's decision could do to already rising real estate prices in the area, but Hamrick said Thursday's announcement won't solve those problems.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"From a broader view, this decision will do nothing to resolve the challenges associated with housing affordability voiced by critics of the Amazon decision and the generous tax incentives offered by government,\" Hamrick said in comments obtained by Fox News. \"That requires a bigger conversation which could very well unfold along with the 2020 election cycle.\"\nFox News' James Rogers, Christopher Carbone and the Associated Press contributed to this report. This story has been updated with comment from Mayor de Blasio and Ocasio-Cortez."

      "text": "NEW YORK \u2013 Former President Trump has broken political norms by visiting one of the most deep-blue areas in New York City, a town not necessarily known for its kindness to Republicans.\nTrump rallied a crowd of what his campaign estimated to be 25,000 supporters at Crotona Park in the Bronx on Thursday, far more than the initial 3,500 it said were expected to attend. Those numbers appeared to also include those lined up outside the event \u2013 who waited hours for a shot at getting inside even after the event began. Law enforcement sources later told The New York Post that between 8,000 and 10,000 attended.\n\"I'm here tonight to declare we are going to turn New York City around, and we are going to turn it around very, very quickly,\" Trump said after taking the stage, vowing to bring back safety and better schools to the city. \"We are going to make New York bigger, better and greater than ever before.\"\nBIDEN'S ABORTION SCRIPT FLIPPED BY BUSINESSWOMAN'S BOOST TO PRO-LIFE GROUPS\nTrump praised the history of New York, but lamented that it was \"now a city in decline.\"\n\"I've never seen it quite like this,\" he said, noting the violent crime taking place on subways and homeless encampments across the city.\nTrump went on to rail against President Biden, saying he wasn't \"getting the job done\" for the people of the Bronx, and that he was \"grossly incompetent.\"\n\"If a New Yorker can't save this city, no one can,\" Trump declared to loud cheers. \"Who said we're not going to win New York?\"\nTOP KENNEDY STAFFER STEPS DOWN FROM ROLE CITING \u2018HATEFUL AND DIVISIVE ATMOSPHERE\u2019\nHe vowed, if elected, to work with Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul and Democrat Mayor Eric Adams to fix the city and state, including renovating the subway system, cleaning up the parks and removing the homeless and mentally ill from the streets.\nTrump also used the speech to rail against the economic downturn facing the country under the Biden administration, with an emphasis on how he said it affected Black and Hispanic families the most, and repeated some of his often used lines about energy, inflation and being \"weak\" on the foreign stage.\nNear the end of the speech, he recited Al Wilson's song, \"The Snake,\" which he often uses as a metaphor to criticize uncontrolled illegal immigration.\nThe thousands of people gathered to see the former president were a diverse group of people, including what Fox News Digital noted were Black, Hispanic, White, Asian and Muslim supporters. A number of attendees traveled from as far as Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut. Many said they were from the Bronx, Brooklyn or Queens.\nThe former president touted his visit on social media ahead of the rally, while his campaign declared he was \"unafraid to bring his message to every borough of New York, to every corner of this great country, because he believes his message is a winning one.\"\nAt one point, someone in the crowd appeared to suffer from a medical incident. Trump paused his speech and asked if anyone in the audience was a doctor. He called for someone to bring water, and after a few minutes people in the area gave thumbs-up signs. Trump responded with a fist pump, thanked the \"doctor\" who assisted and resumed his remarks.\nTrump was the first Republican presidential candidate to actively campaign for the general election in New York City in decades, and, should he pull off what many expect to be an impossible feat, would be the first to win the Empire State in 40 years.\nTrump won less than 10% of the vote in the Bronx in his 2016 presidential election victory. His support in the Bronx edged up to 16% in his 2020 re-election defeat, with Biden winning 83.5% of the vote, but current polls suggest the former president is making more gains with Black and Hispanic voters.\nTrump\u2019s campaign thinks the former president can make a dent in Biden's support among both demographics.\nMany people in attendance told Fox News Digital that their main concerns in the upcoming election were the economy, inflation and illegal immigration. They said they believed President Biden's performance on those issues would lead to more New Yorkers voting for Trump.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nCritics planned a counterprotest to the massive rally, with the Bronx Democratic Party holding their own event in the same park. Fox News Digital noticed a small group of about a few hundred protesters outside the event, but police cleared them out with no massive disruption.\nThey left before the end of Trump's remarks, and late-arriving Trump fans could be seen sprinting up the hill after making their way through security to try and catch a glimpse of the 45th president.\nThe event came during a brief pause in Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan. Closing arguments are expected when court resumes on Tuesday, following a break for the Memorial Day federal holiday."

Andrew Cuomo has spent days criticizing Mamdani's rent-stabilized apartment in Astoria.\n\"We must remember that Andrew Cuomo has spent more time talking about my apartment than asking why so many New Yorkers are being forced out of theirs. He has spent more time criticizing me than he has in criticizing the legislation that Donald Trump has passed,\" Mamdani said on Tuesday.\nMamdani began his week-long tour alongside Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., in Manhattan on Monday morning. After visiting Brooklyn on Tuesday, Mamdani will travel to Staten Island on Wednesday, the Bronx on Thursday and Queens on Friday, Fox News confirmed.\nCUOMO PROPOSES 'ZOHRAN'S LAW' TO PROTECT RENT-STABILIZED HOUSING FROM THE WEALTHY\nThe 33-year-old self-described socialist's tour is a rejection of the Trump administration's sweeping second-term agenda and his so-called \"authoritarian\" attack on working New Yorkers, with Tuesday's event focused on housing.\nZOHRAN MAMDANI LAUNCHES ANTI-TRUMP TOUR ACROSS FIVE BOROUGHS IN NEW YORK CITY\n\"While housing experts are ringing the alarm, Andrew Cuomo is ringing Donald Trump,\" Mamdani said.\nDuring Mamdani's events on Monday and Tuesday, reporters peppered the 33-year-old socialist candidate with questions about Cuomo's latest policy proposal \u2013 \"Zohran's law.\"\nThe former governor, who lost the Democratic mayoral primary to Mamdani in June, began trolling the assemblyman over the weekend with an edited video of Mamdani admitting he pays \"$2,300 for my one bedroom in Astoria.\"\n\"Rent-stabilized apartments when they're vacant should only be rented to people who need affordable housing, not people like Zohran Mamdani,\" Cuomo told reporters in a video posted on social media.\nCuomo said \"Zohran's law\" was designed to prevent high-income individuals from occupying rent-stabilized apartments.\nBut Mamdani fired back at Cuomo's criticism on Tuesday, telling reporters, \"It pains me to say that in our disgraced former Governor Andrew Cuomo's mind, these units, these buildings, these tenants are but a political pawn.\"\nChief among Mamdani's now-infamous progressive policy proposals is his commitment to freezing rents.\n\"As Mayor, Zohran will immediately freeze the rent for all stabilized tenants, and use every available resource to build the housing New Yorkers need and bring down the rent,\" according to Mamdani's campaign website.\nMamdani has accused incumbent Mayor Eric Adams of appointing Rent Guidelines Board members to raise rents on stabilized apartments. While landlords and advocates argue the freeze would be illegal, Mamdani can accomplish this goal by appointing members to the board who wouldn't vote to increase the rent.\nFormer Mayor Bill de Blasio's board voted to freeze the rent three times during his tenure.\nCuomo had previously called the democratic socialist's plan to freeze rent a \"politically convenient posture,\" and said such a move would hurt landlords who would be \"unable to maintain their buildings.\"\nAs Cuomo's fiery social media posts about Mamdani's rent-controlled apartment made the rounds, de Blasio \u2013 who has yet to endorse a candidate in the race to run the nation's most populous city \u2013 fired back at his former governor.\n\"I did a rent freeze and almost 2 million hard-working New Yorkers benefited. @ZohranKMamdani wants to do a rent freeze. You know who doesn\u2019t want to do a rent freeze? @andrewcuomo, and he thinks he can trick us into forgetting that,\" de Blasio trolled on X.\nDuring the first stop on his anti-Trump tour on Monday, Mamdani responded to Cuomo's freshly proposed law \"that will keep the rich out of New York\u2019s affordable housing.\"\n\"What do we know about this policy proposal beyond the fact that it seeks to evict me from my apartment?\" Mamdani questioned on Monday.\n\"Like so much of Andrew Cuomo's politics, it is characterized by a petty vindictiveness. It leaves far more questions than it has answers. How many New Yorkers would this apply to? How many New Yorkers would be evicted from their apartments? How many New Yorkers would have their lives upended by a former governor who is responding to the fact that he was handily beaten by a tenant of a rent-stabilized apartment?\" Mamdani asked.\n\"I live rent-free in his head,\" Mamdani trolled Cuomo, arguing that he had many years to implement such policies as governor but is now only focused on trying to reckon with a \"political defeat.\"\nSoon after Mamdani's criticism, the Cuomo campaign unveiled his proposal to protect rent-stabilized apartments from being occupied by high-income individuals.\n\"Under Cuomo\u2019s proposal, when a rent-stabilized apartment becomes vacant, the incoming individual income would be capped so that the annual rent makes up at least 30 percent of that income. For example, if an apartment rents for $2,500 a month ($30,000 per year), the new tenant\u2019s income could not exceed $100,000,\" according to the plan.\nThe Cuomo campaign also clarified that \"Zohran's law\" would only apply to vacant apartments.\nMamdani poured cold water on Cuomo's plan during the press conference on Tuesday, telling reporters, \"What is so absurd to me about Andrew Cuomo's proposal is that it wouldn't even apply to me. The way that he has put forward this language does not actually apply to me, and yet he uses my name in it.\"\nWhen reached for comment regarding Mamdani's anti-Trump tour, White House spokeswoman, Abigail Jackson, told Fox News Digital, \"Comrade Mamdani is the American people\u2019s worst nightmare. His communist policies will crater our economy, increase crime, crowd out Americans with free health care for illegal immigrants, and defund the brave men and women of law enforcement who keep us safe.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe White House added that \"Mamdani's idea of \u2018immigration reform\u2019 is no borders and amnesty for all the violent criminal illegal aliens that Joe Biden released into our country. The American people have repeatedly rejected this Communist agenda and the more Mamdani shares his radical policies, the more the American people will recoil.\"\nFox News' Marly Carroll and Bryan Llenas contributed to this report."

      "text": "High-tech businesses from other states and abroad that move onto or next to college campuses in New York would operate free of all business, property and personal income taxes for up to 10 years under a proposal released Wednesday by Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\nCuomo said the plan would create jobs in a long-stagnant upstate economy by connecting academic research campuses with businesses in those fields.\n\u201cWe create great businesses here in this state because we have great schools and we have great young minds,\u201d Cuomo said Wednesday in Buffalo during a daylong tour of announcements.\n\u201cWe lose them in the first year. Why? Because we have an anti-business reputation, we\u2019re a high-tax state,\u201d said Cuomo, a Democrat. \u201cWhat we want to do is create an environment where those businesses stay here and create jobs. \u2026 There would be no place in the country that you could go and pay less taxes.\u201d\nIt was unclear whether the proposal would help retain new companies beyond the 10 years in which they would be exempt from what now are some of the nation\u2019s highest taxes. Cuomo wouldn\u2019t answer questions after his first presentation at the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering in Albany.\nEarlier this month, Chief Executive magazine ranked New York as the 49th worst state for business in the opinion of CEOs questioned, based on high taxes, bureaucracy and regulations.\nThe full exemption from all taxes is a \u201cpromising new wrinkle,\u201d said E.J. McMahon of the fiscally conservative Manhattan Institute. \u201cBut the state should go much further than this.\u201d\nMcMahon said the state should use its more generous $440 million tax subsidy for TV and movie productions to phase out all corporate taxes for new and existing companies.\nRepublicans said a broad tax-cutting approach is needed.\n\u201cWe need to improve our overall tax structure and make it friendly to business,\u201d said state Senate GOP leader Dean Skelos. He said the state also needs to cut its business regulations and bureaucracy.\n\u201cWhy,\u201d asked Republican Assemblyman Kieran Michael Lalor back in Albany, \u201cshould New York\u2019s struggling small businesses continue to pay high taxes while the governor lets a few pay no taxes at all?\u201d\nIn Buffalo, reporters asked Cuomo about just that.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working \u2014 we have been the last two years \u2014 reducing taxes all across the board,\u201d Cuomo said.\nState Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said after the Albany announcement that he will insist current New Yorkers benefit from the new jobs and that there be serious \u201cclaw back\u201d provisions and penalties for companies that fail to meet promises of jobs and development.\nSilver, D-Manhattan, said that project has been discussed for weeks and he expects it to be adopted by the Legislature before the end of its session on June 20.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not forever. We\u2019re talking about some five-year benefits, some 10-year benefits,\u201d Silver said. \u201cEventually they are going to become fully taxpaying citizens.\u201d\nSilver said the program would bring in new jobs and new businesses, so technically, there would be no cost to the state.\n\u201cThe tax-free zones will be the answer to finally creating jobs in New York,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Klein, leader of the Independent Democratic Conference in the Senate.\n\u00a9 2013, Daily Freeman"

      "text": "New York\u2019s $10 billion in annual public subsidies and tax breaks to corporations were trashed as wasteful and mired in corruption during a state Senate hearing Friday.\nThe programs that were especially cited for failing to provide the biggest bang for the buck include the hefty $420 million film and TV industry tax credit to shoot projects in New York \u2014 and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s upstate economic development.\n\u201cStudy after study has demonstrated there is a fairly poor return from states that offers a film and tax credit,\u201d said Sen. James Skoufis, chair of the investigations committee.\nUnder questioning, Empire State Development officials could not cite any study that the film and tax credit provides a solid return on investment.\nIndeed, it was revealed at the hearing that ESD does not provide a rigorous analysis of firms receiving tax subsidies.\nThe Citizens Budget Commission, among other researchers, have called for the tax credit program to be phased out and eliminated.\n\u201cBusiness subsidy programs are politicized, beset by scandal and a massive, ongoing corruption risk,\u201d testified John Kaehny, director of the government watchdog group Reinvent Albany.\n\u201cThey are a waste of public funds, and all independent analyses have found them an extremely inefficient way for government to create jobs.\u201d\nThe corporate welfare, Kaehny added, contributes to Albany\u2019s corrupt pay-to-play culture between recipients of the government largesse who then funnel tens of thousands of dollars into coffers of elected officials who support the programs.\n\u201cThere is a reason that subsidies are at the center of the biggest New York corruption scandals of the last decade. The wealthy people who control the businesses receiving billions in state subsidies are among the largest campaign contributors,\u201d Kaehny said.\nCuomo\u2019s controversial Buffalo Billion upstate corporate subsidy programs led to massive bribery and bid-rigging corruption scandals that resulted in felony convictions against the then-governor\u2019s right hand man, Joe Percoco, and the architect of the state programs, Alain Kaloyeros, as well as bidders who were big donors to the former governor.\nSen. John Liu (D-Queens) said the tax breaks for a select few and not others create an unfair playing field.\n\u201cMost jobs created in New York are without state subsidies. It puts companies that don\u2019t get an incentive at a disadvantage,\u201d Liu said.\nEven advocates for the business community said awarding wealthy businesses massive subsidies has provoked a backlash \u2014 particularly when Cuomo and former Mayor Bill de Blasio offered $3 billion in tax subsidies in a failed bid to get e-tail giant Amazon to build a headquarters along the Queens waterfront.\nAmazon withdrew the project amid fierce opposition.\nKathy Wylde, CEO of the Partnership for the City of New York, said people found the Amazon break offensive.\nThe problem, Wylde said, is the tax incentives are offered to offset the high cost of doing business in New York, including regulatory costs as well as taxes.\n\u201cIn New York state, the primary role of economic development incentives has been to offset the high costs of doing business in the state. Our experience with the Amazon HQ2 fiasco illustrates how poorly New York\u2019s approach to economic development has been working,\u201d Wylde said.\nShe said the Amazon debacle was instructive.\n\u201cVirginia won the HQ2, including the additional 20,000 jobs originally intended for New York, in a bid that did not require tax subsidies because they are a state with competitive tax rates,\u201d Wylde said.\n\u201cInstead, their offer was to put up state funding for new transit, affordable housing and a huge fund to prepare thousands of local residents for Amazon jobs. With a similar package, New York would have kept those jobs, but we were stuck with the wrong tools and a cost structure that had to be mitigated to get into the game.\u201d\nThe lawmakers who complained about subsidies raised corporate taxes last year from 6.5 percent to 7.25 percent for firms making more than $5 million in income.\nAgency spokesman Matt Gorton responded, \u201cEmpire State Development is laser-focused on creating jobs and expanding economic opportunity for all New Yorkers, and ESD\u2019s incentive programs are delivering results: Tesla surpassed its job and investment commitment and the film production industry contributes more to the Empire State economy \u2014 particularly small businesses \u2014 than any investment it is provided.\n\u201cAs we rebuild our economy from the pandemic, smart, strategic investments to support growing industries are an important tool in New York\u2019s economic development tool kit.\u201d"

He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner. Tiffany Trump welcomed her first child, Alexander Boulos, in 2025 with her husband, Michael Boulos."

      "text": "New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, brought his anti-Trump campaign swing to Staten Island on Wednesday, blasting President Donald Trump's signature immigration reform agenda.\nTrump was once again front-and-center in the race for Gracie Mansion on Wednesday as Mamdani continued his \"Five Boroughs Against Trump\" tour at the Istanbul Bay Authentic Mediterranean Restaurant on Staten Island.\n\"As we gather here on an island, where nearly 1 in 4 were born outside of this country, an island where 30% of its residents speak a language other than English, it's an island that we know is not immune from this horrific crackdown. We are seeing from the Trump administration. We are seeing it and feeling it,\" Mamdani said. \"And we know that it has nothing to do with safety. It has to do with punishment.\"\nWhile Trump campaigned for president last year on securing the border and deporting illegal immigrants, Mamdani is campaigning for mayor this year on protecting New York immigrant communities amid Trump's deportation rollout.\nJoined by Staten Island District Staten Island District Leader, Jasmine Robinson, Immigration Rights Activist, Yesenia Matas, and President of the Staten Island Democratic Association, Ali Ansari, Mamdani focused Wednesday's event on Trump\u2019s \"horrific attacks on New York City\u2019s immigrant communities\" in which he continues to \"rip New Yorkers off the street without due process.\"\nMAMDANI ZINGS CUOMO IN RENT-STABILIZED HOUSING SPAT DURING ANTI-TRUMP TOUR STOP\n\"It is not enough to fight against authoritarianism. What are you also fighting for? We are fighting to keep this city a sanctuary city,\" he said.\nMamdani said earlier this month that New York City and the United States are facing a \"dark moment.\" He then called the Trump administration an \"authoritarian government\" and slammed ICE for \"abduct[ing]\" immigrants.\"\nAccording to Mamdani's campaign website, he is committed to \"Trump-proofing NYC,\" by removing ICE from \"all City facilities\" and strengthening sanctuary city laws.\nZOHRAN MAMDANI LAUNCHES ANTI-TRUMP TOUR ACROSS FIVE BOROUGHS IN NEW YORK CITY\nResistance to Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration dominated headlines during New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, in which Mamdani handily won in June.\nPrimary contender and New York City Comptroller Brad Lander\u2014whom Mamdani cross-endorsed and campaigned with in the primary\u2014was arrested by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents in June after being accused of assaulting a federal officer as he tried to escort a migrant from their federal immigration court hearing.\nWhile Lander ultimately faced no charges, the incident catapulted Trump's illegal immigration crackdown onto the New York City campaign trail.\nAfter being detained for several hours, Lander joined fellow primary candidates outside 26 Federal Plaza, an immigration facility in Manhattan, as Mamdani called the incident \"fascism.\"\nIt was one such instance of elected officials being detained by federal immigration officials as they protested Trump's deportations, including Newark mayor Ras Baraka in neighboring New Jersey.\nSen. Alex Padilla of California was also forcibly removed and handcuffed by federal agents earlier this year when he shouted questions about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids at DHS Secretary Kristi Noem during a press conference.\nProtests rejecting ICE have erupted across the country this year, particularly in Los Angeles, where protests delved into riots, leading Trump to authorize the National Guard without Gov. Gavin Newsom's request \u2013 the first time in 60 years.\nDuring incumbent Mayor Eric Adams' tenure, New York City became an epicenter of the migrant crisis as President Joe Biden's administration lifted COVID-era Title 42 expulsions and Gov. Greg Abbott, R-Texas, began sending busloads of migrants to New York City from his border state.\nAs the situation unfolded, Adams began speaking out against Biden's immigration policies, calling New York City's migrant crisis a state of emergency.\nWhen Mamdani declared victory in the Democratic primary, he described his vision for New York City\u2019s future as a place \"where the mayor will use their power to reject Donald Trump's fascism, to stop mass ICE agents from deporting our neighbors and to govern our city as a model for the Democratic Party.\"\nMeanwhile, Adams built a reputation during his tenure for challenging Biden's immigration policies while vowing to coordinate with Trump's illegal immigration crackdown, including working alongside Trump's border czar, Tom Homan.\nAdams has also cozied up to Trump since he was elected in November, visiting both Mar-a-Lago and the White House. Trump's Justice Department dropped bribery, wire fraud and conspiracy charges against Adams earlier this year.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nGov. Kathy Hochul, D-N.Y., weighed removing Adams from office following a slew of City Hall resignations after Adams' case was dropped.\nAdams and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo are both running as independent candidates in New York City's mayoral race, and Curtis Sliwa is the Republican nominee.

I've got to get the right people,\" Trump responded.\nHe reflected on his outsider status to relate to the group, emphasizing his roots are entrenched in New York City rather than D.C.\n\"I went to Washington 17 times in my entire life, so I wasn't a Washington person. I was a New York person. I mean, I was here as a developer, so when I went to Washington, all of a sudden, I'm standing in the White House opposite the Lincoln Bedroom, and I said, \u2018Man, this is so amazing.\u2019 But I didn't really know too many [people], so I had to rely on people to give me recommendations for people to run agencies\u2026 and I still did great.\"\nHe picked up after a moment, \"But I had some people that, if I had it to do again, I wouldn't have used.
