  "description": "Things did not end on a good note with Stephen A. Smith and LeBron James.",
  "content": "Things did not end on a good note with Stephen A. Smith and LeBron James.\n\nDuring an appearance on former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas\u2019 \u201cGil\u2019s Arena\u201d podcast Friday, Smith said that he has zero contact with James and does not have any interest in ever speaking to him again.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no situation and there\u2019s no relationship,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like me, and I don\u2019t like him.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s comments stem from his feud with the 21-time All-Star earlier this year, when the two threw jabs at each other during various appearances on ESPN, which ultimately led to an in-person confrontation during a game in March.\n\nThe ESPN sports personality added that other things happened between him and James \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d that the public does not know about.\n\n\u201cAll I would say is people don\u2019t know the things that have happened behind the scenes,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThings that have been said, who they\u2019ve been said to. The kind of things that have been engaged in in an effort to hurt me, along with contemporaries and others.\u201d\n\nSmith also mentioned how he did not appreciate how James came at him on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show,\u201d which airs directly after \u201cFirst Take\u201d on ESPN.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of s\u2013t that I don\u2019t say. And there\u2019s a reason that I feel the way that I do. And the last straw was him approaching me and turning the Bronny thing into something about me attacking somebody\u2019s family, when it was him I was talking about. Not Bronny.\n\n\u201cAnd then to go on \u2018The Pat McAfee Show,\u2019 which comes directly on after my show. On the channel that I work on. To insult me. Now, people can get into all kind of components that go into it and all that other stuff. I have nothing to say.\u201d\n\nSmith concluded by saying that he plans to only mention James in the context of NBA analysis going forward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never going to denigrate any employer, any partner, or myself by getting into anything excessively, unnecessarily, when it comes to him or anybody else,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019m going to do my job. I\u2019m going to cover the game of basketball.\n\n\u201cBut if I never, ever speak to him again in life, that will be OK. And I\u2019m good with it.\u201d",

      "text": "Gary Player believes Jordan Spieth can be the standard in golf.\nAnd that\u2019s why the golf legend said it\u2019s a \u201ctragedy\u201d that Spieth has fallen off due to what he believes is poor coaching.\n\u201cJordan Spieth, I think, is the best golfer in the world, but in my opinion, he was taught the wrong thing. He was taught the wrong thing. And he just went downhill,\u201d Player said in a video \u201cThe Golf Supply\u201d YouTube channel posted this week. \u201cIf you had a man like Ben Hogan teaching Jordan Spieth, he would be the best in the world. He\u2019s such a competitor, such a wonderful man. A wonderful guy for golf, the best short game, oh man, best course management, but, man, he just can\u2019t hit the ball, ya know? That is a tragedy.\u201c\nPlayer, 89, tackled Spieth\u2019s career while teaching a player and discussing the \u201ctremendous lack of knowledge\u201d in the sport.\nHe bemoaned the coaching that American players are receiving, specifically the bowed wrist technique, saying once players do that, \u201cyou\u2019re gone\u201d and \u201cyour golf career is limited.\u201d\n\u201cI would say in America today, the golf pros that are teaching know less about golf,\u201d he said.\nPlayer, who won nine majors, first mentioned Dustin Johnson, asking: \u201cWhen\u2019s the last you heard of Dustin Johnson?\u201d\nHe later told the student how a golfer has to get his hands under the club and then commented on Spieth and Rickie Fowler.\nPlayer did, though, have some hope for Spieth, saying he saw his swing recently.\n\u201cSo, he might do a lot better this week,\u201d Player said, \u201cI\u2019m hoping he will.\u201d\nSpieth, 31, ranked as the top player in the world in 2015 and has won three majors in his career, but last did so in 2017, when he triumphed at The Open Championship.\nHe currently ranks 52nd in the sport and has not won an event since the 2022 RBC Heritage.\nSpieth has finished fourth twice this year, but also tallied 40th, 31st and 38th results in his last three events, respectively.\nHe withdrew from an event due to injury for the first time in his career earlier this year.\nSpieth is not competing in this week\u2019s BMW Championship since he finished outside the top 50 of the FedEx Cup standings."

      "text": "Stephen A. Smith still has some words for LeBron James after their courtside dispute in March.\nIn case you thought there was a chance that the two could make up \u2014 that\u2019s highly unlikely.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like him, and he don\u2019t like me,\u201d Smith said in Q&A with Rolling Stone\u2019s Danyel Smith that was published Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the greatest players who\u2019s ever lived. I\u2019m going to show him that respect, and I\u2019m going to cover him objectively. When he does great, I\u2019m gonna applaud. When he doesn\u2019t do great, I\u2019m not gonna applaud.\u201d\nBut while the ESPN star says he\u2019ll do his job without letting their dislike for each other get in the way, he still has issues with how James confronted him at the Lakers\u2019 March 6 game against the Knicks.\n\u201cHe hid behind his son, tried to make something out of nothing, as if I was dogging his son, which I was not,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe real issue was we don\u2019t like each other. And he used that as an excuse to confront me. I got it.\u201d\nIn a viral moment, James challenged Smith on the sidelines of the game after Smith had pleaded in an episode of \u201cFirst Take\u201d for James to step in \u201cas a father\u201d and stop the Lakers from giving Bronny James any playing time after Los Angeles drafted him with the 55th pick in the NBA draft.\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a basketball player confronting me. That was a parent. That was a father,\u201d Smith said initially after the incident. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t sit here and be angry, or feel slighted by LeBron James and any way in that regard. By all accounts, he\u2019s obviously a wonderful family man and a wonderful father who cares very, very deeply about his son.\u201d\nBut Smith has seemingly gotten more upset over the incident as time has passed.\nJames said later on in March that Smith missed the point of their conversation.\n\u201cNever would I ever not allow people to talk about the sport, criticize players about what they do on the court,\u201d James said on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show.\u201d \u201c\n\u201cBut when you take it and you get personal with it, it\u2019s my job to not only protect my damn household but protect the players.\u201d"
