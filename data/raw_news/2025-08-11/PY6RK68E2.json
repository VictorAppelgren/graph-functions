  "description": "Lauren Hemp says it is \"so good\" to \"give something back\" as she visits aspiring young footballers.",
  "content": "One of the Euro 2025-winning Lionesses said it was \"so good\" to \"give something back\" as she visited aspiring young footballers in her home county. England striker Lauren Hemp signed shirts and boots at The Nest community hub in Norwich on Sunday. The 25-year-old opened the Lauren Hemp Community 3G Pitch at the venue last year. Hemp said it was \"incredible\" to see so many aspiring girls.\n\n\"It's so good to come back to the place I still call home and be able to see everyone and give something back to the people that helped me,\" she said. \"I used to play in a boys' team when I was younger... I want there to just be so many girls who want to be footballers when they are older.\" The Play Like Hemp event was arranged by Norwich City FC's Girl's Football and Education Pathway. \"Watching all the girls here reminds me of when I was younger and I used to do this and come to soccer schools and it was incredible back then and I have a lot of thanks to Norwich staff.\"\n\nSummer Ward, the girls' football development manager, said it meant \"everything\" for the aspiring players to meet Hemp. \"I think the effect that obviously the Lionesses and Lauren especially in this area, has had on women's football and the girls' game, is fantastic, and hopefully it continues to grow,\" she said. \"Myself and Lauren grew up playing football together... she's still as grounded as ever.\" For 14-year-old Grace, she said being from the same place as Hemp gave her hope for her footballing future. \"I play in the same position as Lauren; she taught me so much from watching her,\" said Grace.\n\nSixteen-year-old Bryony has been collecting signatures from the Lionesses on a football shirt, and until the event on Sunday, she had one special player's autograph missing. She was invited to the Football Association's national training centre in Staffordshire - St George's Park - after her parents applied for her to be a ball girl. \"I was paralysed from the neck down, my brain shut off, I couldn't walk... [but] after over a year of rehabilitation I'm back here and playing for my club again which I love.\"",

It's such an honour and I'm so grateful.\"\nHemp was a key player as England reached the final of Euro 2025 in Switzerland and retained their crown by beating Spain in a penalty shootout on July 27.\nWith her home town packed out for her return, as it was three years ago after she won her first Euros medal, Hemp continued: \"It's unbelievable. There's so many people here that I used to go to school with.\n\"It's nice coming back and seeing everyone and nice seeing all the support I've got back home.\n\"When you're in the tournament, I feel like you don't necessarily see it as much. It's not until you get back here and see everyone supporting me. It's been incredible.\"\nShe plays professionally for Manchester City but started out playing with boys teams at North Walsham Town FC.\nShe joined Norwich City's Centre of Excellence at 10 years old, but it was disbanded five years later.\nHemp then returned to her hometown club and was again playing alongside boys until joining Bristol City at 16.\nFollowing the Lionesses' success, North Walsham Town has been inundated with youngsters wanting to play football and has appealed for more coaches to get involved.\nThat appeal was echoed by Hemp, who added: \"The women's game is growing and we need coaches to come and help that growth. It's so important and obviously I'd encourage it so much.\n\"I started out somewhere and there were many amazing coaches along the journey to get me where I am today.\"\nNorth Walsham's Market Place was shut between 10:00 and 14:00 on Tuesday for the celebration event, and the single-decker bus named after her was unveiled at 11:00.\nCharles Sanders, managing director of Sanders Coaches, said Hemp had been chosen after a competition asking which local person should be honoured.\n\"So we asked through her mother whether it was something she would like to have done and she agreed,\" he said.\n\"Obviously we have had to wait until now for her to come back to Norfolk to actually do it, and in between times they've gone and won the Euros again, so it's absolutely brilliant.\"\nHemp was also presented with a Lego bus, having become known as fan of the miniature bricks and being spotted with a Beauty and the Beast castle during England's title celebrations.\nMartin Miles, landlord of the King's Arms, was able to watch Hemp's homecoming from his pub.\n\"It's a great day for North Walsham. There's hundreds of people in town,\" he said.\n\"She's out there and the kids are all queuing up to have photographs.
