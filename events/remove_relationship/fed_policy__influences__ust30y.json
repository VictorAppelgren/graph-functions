      "current_analysis": "UST 10‑yr (ust10y) is projected to fall 10–20 bp over the next 0–3 weeks (19EGBBWWB)(GXYXMKIG5)(3952FOSRQ)(3YAQ8JUPL). The decline is driven by a chain of events: intensified ICE raids have cut immigrant labor, leading to a 30–40 % sales drop, dampening growth expectations, lowering inflation expectations, and compressing the term‑premium by roughly 10 bp (19EGBBWWB); the Trump‑era attempt to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook has heightened the probability of a 25‑bp rate cut at the September FOMC, which would lower short‑term rates and further reduce the term‑premium by about 15 bp (GXYXMKIG5); the appeals‑court ruling that barred the 10 % tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada has removed a key inflation risk, trimming the risk‑premium by roughly 5 bp (3952FOSRQ); meanwhile, recent weakness in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq has spurred risk‑aversion, pushing demand for safe assets and lifting short‑term yields, which adds about 5 bp to the term‑premium (3YAQ8JUPL). The net effect is a net 10–20 bp decline in ust10y, assuming all catalysts play out (19EGBBWWB)(GXYXMKIG5)(3952FOSRQ)(3YAQ8JUPL). Key catalyst dates are the tariff ruling on Sep 5, the core PCE release on Sep 10, and the Fed FOMC on Sep 12 (3952FOSRQ)(3YAQ8JUPL)(GXYXMKIG5). Invalidation signals that would reverse the outlook include a Fed decision to hold or raise rates (GXYXMKIG5), a core PCE reading above 2.5 % in the next release (3YAQ8JUPL), a court reinstating the 10 % tariffs (3952FOSRQ), or a >5 % rebound in the spx/ndx that reduces risk‑aversion (3YAQ8JUPL). The actionable stance is to short ust10y with a target of 4.13 % (‑10 bp from the current 4.23 %) if the catalysts materialise; if any invalidation signal appears, shift to a neutral position (19EGBBWWB)(GXYXMKIG5)(3952FOSRQ)(3YAQ8JUPL).",

      "fundamental_analysis": "The 10‑year UST yield is now governed by a real‑rate differential that has become largely decoupled from the Fed’s policy reaction function, because the Fed’s September 2024 cuts have not translated into lower long‑term rates (HYJA10SKI). The expected reduction in the federal funds rate should, in a normal transmission setting, lower the short‑term tail of the yield curve and compress the term premium; however, the simultaneous tightening of the Fed’s balance sheet has pushed Treasury supply higher, while fiscal uncertainty across advanced economies has elevated the risk premium demanded by investors (LF0UUL917)(BSV8LPNDM). In addition, persistent supply‑chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions have kept inflation expectations sticky, reinforcing a higher term‑premium component that offsets the policy‑induced downward pressure (BSV8LPNDM). Thus the causal chain is: Fed cuts → expected lower short‑term rates → unchanged or higher long‑term rates because (i) higher fiscal‑deficit‑driven risk premium, (ii) sticky inflation feeding a larger term premium, and (iii) Fed balance‑sheet contraction increasing Treasury supply (HYJA10SKI)(LF0UUL917).  \n\nCatalyst windows that will test this equilibrium are: the September 2024 policy shift itself, the Q4 2025 fiscal‑deficit releases that will reveal the trajectory of the risk premium, the 2026 balance‑sheet contraction that will further expand Treasury supply, and the 2025‑26 balance‑of‑payments data that will indicate whether the U.S. BoP is tightening or loosening (BSV8LPNDM). In the absence of a reversal in any of these drivers, the base case is that the 10‑year yield will remain in the 4.5‑5.0 % band through mid‑2027, with only modest upward drift as the Fed’s policy stance normalizes (HYJA10SKI).  \n\nKey risks to this outlook are a persistent high risk premium if fiscal deficits widen or if geopolitical shocks intensify, and a delayed fiscal consolidation that could push the risk premium higher (BSV8LPNDM). Monitoring the Fed’s forward guidance, CPI releases, fiscal‑deficit data, BoP statistics, and term‑premium spreads will provide early signals of any shift in this trajectory.",

      "executive_summary": "DXY is poised to rise ~200 bp to ~99.8 over the next 3–6 months if the CPI released on 2025‑08‑15 exceeds expectations, Trump’s 100 % semiconductor tariff and 50 % Indian tariff remain in place, and Zelenskiy’s comments keep war‑risk sentiment high (XTQIQRP5K)(Z7O1DCHS7). A Fed policy cut on 2025‑09‑17 would lower ust10y by 10–15 bp, compress the term premium, and lift DXY by 50–100 bp (Z7O1DCHS7)(7XH2DKEKV). If the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread narrows below 30 bp by 2025‑09‑01, DXY would decline another 50–100 bp (7XH2DKEKV). Mortgage rates, which track ust10y (us_mortgage_rates ↔ ust10y), provide a real‑time barometer of the term‑premium channel; a decline in mortgage rates would further weaken DXY, while a rise would strengthen it (LF0UUL917)(97MD1FHW8). Watch the CPI release on 2025‑08‑15, Trump’s tariff announcements on 2025‑08‑11, Zelenskiy’s remarks on 2025‑08‑11, the Fed’s September policy statement on 2025‑09‑17, and the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread on 2025‑09‑01; invalidate the upside case if CPI falls below 2 % for two consecutive quarters or tariffs are lifted (XTQIQRP5K)(97MD1FHW8).",

      "movers_scenarios": "Over the 2025‑08‑15 to 2025‑09‑30 window, the dollar index (DXY) is poised to move in tandem with the 10‑year Treasury yield and the 30‑year mortgage rate, with the causal chain running from CPI expectations to Fed policy to term‑premium to yields to DXY and mortgage rates (LF0UUL917)(XTQIQRP5K). If the CPI released on 2025‑08‑15 exceeds 3 % (XTQIQRP5K), market pricing of continued Fed tightening will lift the 10‑year yield to 4.20‑4.25 % (97MD1FHW8), compress the term‑premium and push the DXY up 30‑50 bp while squeezing mortgage rates by 10‑15 bp (LF0UUL917)(XTQIQRP5K); the probability of this base case is 70 % (XTQIQRP5K). Conversely, a CPI reading below 3 % (XTQIQRP5K) would trigger a 25‑bp Fed policy cut on 2025‑09‑16 (3YAQ8JUPL), lowering the 10‑year yield to 4.15‑4.20 % (97MD1FHW8) and pulling the DXY down while easing mortgage rates to 6.5‑6.7 % (LF0UUL917); the probability of this CPI miss scenario is 60 % (Z7O1DCHS7). A Fed rate hike of 25 bp on 2025‑09‑16 (3YAQ8JUPL) would reverse the trend, raising the 10‑year yield by more than 15 bp (97MD1FHW8), lifting mortgage rates by 10‑15 bp (LF0UUL917) and pushing the DXY up 30‑50 bp (XTQIQRP5K); the probability of this Fed‑raise scenario is 15 % (Z7O1DCHS7). Finally, if inflation falls below 2 % for two consecutive quarters, the Fed would again cut rates by 25 bp on 2025‑09‑16 (3YAQ8JUPL), reducing the 10‑year yield to 4.15‑4.20 % (97MD1FHW8), easing mortgage rates by 10‑15 bp (LF0UUL917) and dragging the DXY lower; the probability of this inflation‑fall scenario is 20 % (Z7O1DCHS7).",

      "drivers": "DXY is projected to fall ~200 bp to 95.8 by Aug 31, driven by an 86 % probability of a September Fed cut and a 57 bp steepening of the 2‑yr/10‑yr curve (Z7O1DCHS7)(7XH2DKEKV). Fed policy → fed funds → term‑premium → ust10y ↑ → DXY ↓ (Z7O1DCHS7)(7XH2DKEKV). A September Fed meeting could lift ust10y by 10–15 bp, pushing DXY lower; a PCE > 3 % or NFP > expected on Aug 30/31 would lift DXY 50–100 bp; a 2‑yr/10‑yr spread < 30 bp would have a similar effect (7XH2DKEKV). Risk of Fed policy reversal or an unexpected 10‑year yield rise > 15 bp would strengthen DXY (Z7O1DCHS7)(7XH2DKEKV). Watch: Fed minutes, Aug 30 PCE, Aug 31 NFP, 2‑yr/10‑yr spread. Confidence: ~70 % base case, upside/downside each ~15 %. Action: Short‑sell DXY to 95.8; monitor Fed policy and PCE/NFP for reversal.  \n\nMortgage rates, currently anchored at 6.5‑7.0 % as ust10y trades 4.20‑4.30 % (97MD1FHW8)(LF0UUL917), serve as a real‑time barometer for the term‑premium trajectory and reinforce the DXY’s sensitivity to yield changes (LF0UUL917)(7XH2DKEKV). us_mortgage_rates ↔ ust10y (97MD1FHW8)(LF0UUL917).",
      "medium_analysis": "The U.S. labor market is on the brink of a stall‑speed scenario that could lift unemployment to about 6 % by the end of 2025, as Wall Street strategists point to weaker‑than‑expected July job gains and revisions in May and June (GK86UUQPN). A self‑reinforcing rise in unemployment would prompt the Fed to cut rates earlier than the September 2025 meeting, with officials signalling a 25 bp cut (GK86UUQPN)(7GU5QDMM4). Historical Fed cuts have lowered the 10‑year Treasury yield by 30–50 bp, so a September cut would likely push the ust10y down 30–50 bp (7GU5QDMM4). The resulting easing of rates would weaken the dollar by 1–2 % through December 2025 (7GU5QDMM4), depress the S&P 500 by 5–10 % (7GU5QDMM4), and lift the VIX by 10–20 pts (7GU5QDMM4).  \n\nThe August 31, 2025 jobs report is the critical catalyst that will confirm or invalidate the stall‑speed thesis; a weak release would cement the 6 % unemployment outlook and trigger the Fed cut, while a stronger report would keep rates on hold (GK86UUQPN). The tariff ruling effective October 14, 2025 could add inflationary pressure and delay the Fed cut (B50S2PG8O). The September 2025 FOMC meeting will decide the rate path (7GU5QDMM4). Watch signals include the August jobs data, the September Fed meeting, and the October tariff ruling."
