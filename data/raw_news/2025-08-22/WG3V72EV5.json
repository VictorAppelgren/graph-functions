That allowed numerous abuses, including a pending case involving nearly 200 decomposing bodies that were found being stored at room temperature in a building in Penrose, Colorado, about 30 miles from Pueblo.\nA sentencing of one of the funeral homes owners in that case on charges of corpse abuse is set for Friday.\nCotter and his brother bought Davis Mortuary in 1989, according to the business\u2019s website.
