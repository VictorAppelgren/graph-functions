      "feedback": "The draft overreads territory (regime-map depth) and exceeds the 4–6-sentence/bullet limit for a professional investor brief; to reach world-class, condense into 4–6 executive bullets that deliver a single, decision-ready house view, with each line anchored to a concrete catalyst, a quantified earnings/price-channel, and an explicit watch-list, and place the strongest claim first (base-case tariff regime) with a one-line bottom-line. Strengthen causal clarity by tying each regime state to a concrete asset/sector outcome (e.g., pass-through levers in autos, apparel, and semis; margin impact from a ~$350m annual tariff bill with ~80% pass-through ~ ~$4 per tire) and attach the corresponding source IDs after the claim (AJTHKYXQ3; OFY11YO0I; 194059448.html). Prune hedges and unverified rumors (e.g., the unverified government equity-stake claim) or relocate them to a clearly labeled “noise” line, and ensure every assertion about timing or policy action cites a source (RHFWI02JT; 9W8ZUIBDY; QRX2HD4X0; 2SJORBV6H; 184224630.html; 191201706.html; WLXM1819K; understanding-cusma-compliance.html; DCTS-related items). Reconcile conflicts by presenting a probability-weighted base-case with succinct alternate-paths (Alt-1: rapid Supreme Court/bilateral resolution; Alt-2: no quick resolution with continued cross-border repricing via CUSMA/DCTS) and explicitly map each scenario to pricing/risk premia across the horizon; increase the density of cross-source checks (cite after each statement) and trim redundancy and narrative fluff to meet the executive style. Finally, structure the horizon into a tight 0–3 week view (timing-driven catalysts: EU auto-relief timetable; India tariff trigger; Aug 28 de minimis), 3–6 month flow (the 90-day tariff-truce extension as the hinge), and a near-term watch-list (court actions July 31, 2025; potential Supreme Court action; UK DCTS implementation early 2026; CUSMA rulings), with one concise 1–2 sentence house view at the top and a compact 4–6 bullet summary at the end.",
