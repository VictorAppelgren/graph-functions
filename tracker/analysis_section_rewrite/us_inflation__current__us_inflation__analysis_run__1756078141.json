      "feedback": "Strong start tying near‑term drivers to Krugman’s stagflation risk, the AI capex impulse, and policy credibility (Lagarde/Jackson Hole) but the piece should tighten the 0–3 week horizon, sharpen the causal chain, and add explicit, source‑anchored thresholds and alternative scenarios. Edit to (a) state a crisp 0–3 week thesis up front: near‑term inflation risk from tariffs and policy risk from Trump’s interventions exists, but a robust AI‑driven capex wave and central‑bank credibility support a conditional soft landing; (b) lay out a formal transmission map with concrete catalysts: tariff/DEPORTATION policy signals and any inflation prints (Krugman/scenario primer in 218AGGUXB), Intel/tech‑policy moves (the 10% stake and related debate in 218AGGUXB), AI‑capex announcements (e.g., SoftBank/OpenAI/Oracle nexus and other trillion‑level US investments cited in the White House list), and Lagarde Powell commentary (U6HXAJR4J) driving rate expectations; (c) add explicit thresholds and invalidation rules you monitor next: inflation surprises vs entrenched inflation signals, market pricing of rate paths, and policy signals that could erode credibility; (d) deliver a concise base case plus at least one bear and one upside scenario with quantified risk drivers (tariff shock magnitude, AI‑capex momentum, and central‑bank response); (e) quantify where possible using numbers from sources (e.g., 10% Intel stake; $8.7B payment; multi‑hundred‑billion to trillion‑dollar private/public investments; AI capex scale); (f) reconcile conflicts by calling out divergent signals—Krugman’s stagflation risk vs Cuban’s inventory/credit‑cost channel vs the pro‑growth investment narrative—and show how they would revise the near‑term reaction function if one channel dominates; (g) tighten sourcing discipline so every assertion links to 218AGGUXB, LLN6N4H3Z, or U6HXAJR4J, and down‑weight tangential items (e.g., non‑core political bits) unless they specifically affect policy credibility or market risk premia. This will produce a world‑class, wallet‑tested 0–3 week view: a tight thesis, a traceable causal chain, explicit catalysts with thresholds, and a structured risk/regime‑change rubric anchored by the three core sources.",
