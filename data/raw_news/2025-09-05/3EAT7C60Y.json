This new feature will initially be available to Xbox Insiders as part of a test they are conducting.\n\nWith this, users on the lower tiers would get the chance to play the titles that are part of their subscriptions, titles that they own, and other cloud-playable games via the cloud service.\n\nAccording to The Verge, the latest announcement came after a previous teaser last week that said users will soon get \"more affordable\" and accessible ways to enjoy Xbox's cloud-based games.\n\nIt is important to note that prior to this testing, Microsoft has required users to be on the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate tier to get access to the Xbox Cloud Gaming service and enjoy the experience.\n\nThe Verge also reported that Microsoft previously mentioned their development of a separate version of Xbox Cloud Gaming outside the Game Pass Ultimate, and a possible free cloud gaming access with ads.\n\nThere is another requirement to get the Xbox Cloud Gaming access apart from already needing an active Game Pass Core or Game Pass Standard subscription. According to Microsoft, only users part of the Xbox Insider Program would get the chance to try out the new cloud service for the aforementioned tiers.\n\nThe good thing is that this extra requirement is easy to accomplish as users only need to register their existing Xbox account to join its Insider Program. Alongside this, users are also advised to download the Xbox Insider Hub for their preferred platform, whether on the Windows PC or Xbox One and Xbox Series S and X consoles.\n\nMicrosoft is throwing in a couple of selected PC games for Game Pass Core and Standard users to try out via the Xbox Cloud Gaming experience.\n\nAlternatively, users may visit this link to view the cloud-based games they could stream on their devices or head on over to the Xbox app on their respective consoles or devices.",

      "text": "Microsoft's new layoffs, which affect 9,000 employees, have heavily impacted Xbox as it has also led to the cancellation of certain titles.\nOne of which is the long-awaited reboot of \"Perfect Dark\" and a new game called \"Everwild\" from the studio behind \"Sea of Thieves.\"\n'Perfect Dark' Reboot, 'Everwild' Canceled\nIn a move that has upset many fans of \"Perfect Dark,\" the reboot of the game will no longer push through. The original game was released 25 years ago in 2000.\nAccording to a report by CNET, the cancellation of the game is due to the fact that its studio, The Initiative, will be shut down as part of Microsoft's layoffs.\nFootage from the game was shared to the public during the Xbox Games Showcase last year, exciting many fans around the world. This excitement has now been snuffed by Microsoft.\nIn addition, a new game called \"Everwild\" from the studio that developed \"Sea of Thieves\" has also been canceled. Rare, the studio behind \"Sea of Thieves,\" will also be greatly impacted by layoffs, resulting in the axing of the game.\nAccording to the report, the development of many unannounced titles has also been axed due to the layoffs.\nPhil Spencer Speaks Out in Internal Memo\nAccording to Variety, Xbox Head Phil Spencer, who dealt with retirement rumors amid the layoffs said in an internal memo that \"To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness.\"\n\"Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today's notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days,\" he added.\nIt should be noted that the games presented during the 2025 Xbox Games Showcase are still under development. These include \"Call of Duty: Black Ops 7,\" \"Gears of War: Reloaded,\" and \"Solo Levling Arise: Overdrive,\" among others."
