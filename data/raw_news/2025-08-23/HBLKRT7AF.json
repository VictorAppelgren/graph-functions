  "content": "Fujifilm just released its newest digital camera, which just so happens to be one of its smallest to date. The new Fujifilm X Half pays homage to half-frame film cameras of years\u2019 past with a retro-style design and minimal 240-gram weight, alongside some of the brand\u2019s usual flair, such as film simulations and other photo effects.\n\nI\u2019ve been waiting to buy the X Half for myself since first writing about its debut back in June and finally picked it up to put it through its paces at the 2025 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships in Anaheim, California, where I took advantage of a wide range of subjects and lighting conditions to see if this was the dream travel camera I\u2019ve been searching for. Not to spoil too much, but after taking more than 1,000 photos with it, let\u2019s just say I\u2019m sold.\n\nWhat I liked about it\n\nThe only place that makes sense to start when talking about a camera is the results. With so many words like \u201ccompact,\u201d \u201cportable\u201d and \u201cretro\u201d attached to the X Half, seeing how it actually fared when taking photos is all that matters at the end of the day. As much as I love its stylish two-tone chrome-and-vinyl finish, taking photos I\u2019d actually want to share is what would make or break this new release from Fujifilm.\n\nTo find out for myself, I spent the past week putting the new camera and its 1-inch, 17.74-megapixel sensor to the test by using it in quite a few different settings. Paired with the fixed 10.8mm f/2.8 lens, it has a versatile, wide-angle field of view that can perform well in all sorts of situations, from close-up portraits and candid shots to landscape photography and capturing as much of your surroundings as possible. During a recent trip to California, I had the opportunity to use the X Half for shooting a day at Disneyland as well as a full weekend at the Pok\u00e9mon World Championships. Both settings allowed me to test the camera with a wide batch of subjects.\n\nFujifilm cameras across the board do an exceptional job at capturing color. That means even a teensy camera like this can still lock in vibrant hues in all sorts of lighting conditions. I loved how vivid many of the above shots turned out. The neon diner aesthetics of this year\u2019s event played to that particularly well, doubling down on the already colorful designs of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise. These characters are already some of the best subjects for showing off how Fujifilm applies its color scenes to the X Half, which made me even more excited to bring the camera along on the trip.\n\nI also adore how crisp many of the focus points of shots are. Close-up product shots, as in the fifth picture, stand out against fading backgrounds, while other photos highlight how soft and dreamy some of the compositions can turn out. Even low-light pictures, as in the fourth image in the gallery, end up looking great. Being able to dial in pictures based on the vibes I\u2019m going for sold me on the X Half, and the final products speak for themselves.\n\nBut you don\u2019t just have to take my words for it. While I may have taken more than 1,000 pictures with it, you\u2019ll find a handful of my favorite shots in the gallery above. I also have the full collection of photos uploaded on my Flickr in their full glory for all you pixel peepers out there.\n\nThe first thing you\u2019ll notice with the Fujifilm X Half is just how small it is. It\u2019s far tinier than even compact mirrorless cameras like the Fujifilm X-T5 I typically shoot on, and it\u2019s incredibly light to boot. That means it\u2019s not only small enough to always have on you but also not adding too much inconvenient weight after a long day. After all, what good is something that can fit in practically any purse or backpack if it weighs too much to be comfortable? I took it a step further and carried the camera around in my pocket for much of my trip, and even that was pleasant.\n\nSo many other features of the X Half position it as a replacement to your smartphone\u2019s camera, and the size really just drives that point home. It\u2019s suitable to bring with you to places a typical dedicated camera couldn\u2019t go, such as concerts and sporting events. I don\u2019t shy away from trying to capture worthy photos of punk rock shows and Rangers hockey games, but my usual camera isn\u2019t allowed in most venues due to its detachable lens. Fujifilm\u2019s latest offering relies on a fixed lens, which means it actually gets the seal of approval from event security, thus getting that same approval from me.\n\nDespite the X Half\u2019s small size, Fujifilm has managed to pack in many of the physical controls I already know and love and use from its other models. Depending on actual dials and switches is far more reliable in the moment than your smartphone\u2019s display \u2014 one of the main reasons to switch \u2014 and Fujifilm makes it easier than ever to lock down a shot without having to fuss with a screen. While running around Disneyland and the Anaheim Convention Center, I wanted to be focused on the world around me, not messing with settings on my camera, so using the tactile top control dial, pseudo film advance lever and manual aperture ring around the lens made the whole process of shooting far more precise \u2014 and far more fun.\n\nThe vertical sensor is by far the Fujifulm X Half\u2019s most unique element, setting it apart from other point-and-shoots that share a similar size and similar features. Just about every other camera on the market these days uses a rectangular sensor positioned horizontally, but Fujifilm is mixing it up this time around with a focus on this new design that makes the camera perfect for capturing photos that are not just worthy of posting to social media but also the correct aspect ratio.\n\nVertical photography is essentially the standard when shooting with your smartphone these days, and the vertical sensor allows you to hold the camera normally to produce tall pics that fit right in with the rest of your camera roll or Instagram stories. I did find that the inverted process of holding the camera to take horizontal photos was a bit disorienting at first, but once it finally clicked I was back to shooting like a pro.\n\nWhile some might call this a gimmick, I wouldn\u2019t. I love Fujifilm cameras for their ability to spit out photos I don\u2019t have to edit or process after the fact. The X Half\u2019s vertical sensor doubles down on this, making it that much easier to snap a picture that\u2019s ready to send off onto the web.\n\nSpeaking of which, Fujifilm\u2019s signature film simulation modes work even harder to make your photos social-ready. Being able to apply certain effects or styles to a photo right when I press the shutter is one of the main reasons I\u2019ve been shooting with a Fujifilm for years. It\u2019s also the main reason I purchased the X Half over another point-and-shoot, so I was glad it lived up to the experience I\u2019m used to from other (and more expensive) Fujifilm cameras.\n\nThis camera includes 13 different film simulations, including the ultra-vibrant Velvia most of the photos in this review were shot with, the nostalgic Classic Chrome, artistic black-and-white filters and grain effect settings. You can even add an optional time stamp onto the images, as you\u2019d find on older point-and-shoot film cameras. The main film effects can all be controlled using the auxiliary touchscreen, while the larger main touchscreen handles things like the added filters that include light-leak looks, expired film emulation and the ability to take a double exposure.\n\nThere\u2019s also a more involved 2-in-1 shooting mode that takes the whole novelty experience up a notch. Activating this mode allows you to combine two photos, videos or any combination of the pair into a single file. It\u2019s a fun feature that fully leans into making content that\u2019s ready to be immediately shared on social media or sent to friends. In an experience that tries to imitate the film cameras it\u2019s inspired by, using the X Half\u2019s pseudo film advance lever allows you to activate the shooting mode, take a shot, then advance to capturing the second moment in time, be it a video or still image.\n\nTaking a closer look at the touchscreen displays on the X Half, I was pleasantly surprised by how responsive they were. I\u2019ve used so many cameras that have the most lackluster interfaces and hard-to-use screens, but Fujifilm was able to deliver a well-rounded device even in areas where others have failed. The main interface relies on a 2.4-inch color LCD monitor, which is joined by a secondary pill-shaped display used almost exclusively for swiping through film modes. Even if most of my interactions with dialing in a shot were done with the suite of physical controls on the camera, those times where I did have to navigate through the digital menus weren\u2019t all too frustrating.\n\nPair those responsive screens with intuitive menus, and I\u2019d even go so far as to say it\u2019s easy to work with. Swipe up to reveal style settings for shots, swipe down to connect with your smartphone for transferring pictures, swipe left to access shooting details \u2014 image size, exposure mode \u2014 and swipe right to reveal the film simulation settings. It\u2019s a little basic, but it keeps shooting simple. Ultimately, it\u2019s just another inclusion that\u2019s more than appreciated and also helps to justify the camera\u2019s higher price tag.\n\nRounding out the features I can write home about, Fujifilm drives it home with reliable battery life. For a camera of this size, I was delighted to see such consistent and lengthy usage times. During my weeklong trip to California, I charged the camera only twice \u2014 and that\u2019s with several full days of shooting in the books. It\u2019s powered by a removable NP-W126S rechargeable lithium-ion battery that can be refueled from a USB-C port on the side, and it proved to be more than capable of handling the photo-taking duties for seven days of travel, documenting Disney and \u201ccatching them all\u201d at Pok\u00e9mon Worlds.\n\nI found myself so unworried by the battery life that I would even just leave the camera on while it hung around my neck. The worst thing to do when trying to actually enjoy the moments you\u2019re hoping to capture is micromanage battery life, especially when you\u2019re trying to take full advantage of a day at a theme park or get the perfect shot during a live event. I didn\u2019t have to worry about either during my week with the X Half, checking the final box I needed to keep this a regular part of my photography setup.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t like about it\n\nA camera this small means you\u2019re going to have to cut out some features somewhere. The most notable loss for me was the lack of in-body stabilization, which means the camera forgoes any hardware to help correct shaky videos or blurry shots. The technology, when included, allows cameras to stabilize images by physically moving the sensor to counteract camera shake. Without it, you\u2019re looking at a higher chance of producing blurry pictures, especially if you\u2019re moving around. It happened quite a few times for me when I was in a particular rush, be it hustling around a crowded convention center or trying to capture a candid shot of my fianc\u00e9e before she noticed I had her centered in my viewfinder.\n\nWould I have agreed to pay more for a version of the X Half with in-body stabilization? Debatable. Would I love it as much if including this feature meant bulking up the design? Unlikely. So, ultimately, I feel all right with the trade-off, even if I do wish it included the tech. If we\u2019re talking about things that detract from a perfect score, however, this is at the top of my list \u2014 and, at the very least, it\u2019s something to keep in mind when figuring out if this camera is right for you.\n\nEarlier, I know I said I appreciated not having to fuss with settings, but that\u2019s just when I\u2019m actively trying to capture photos. Outside of shooting sessions, I do like being able to adjust how the camera performs, something the X Half resists. You can tell Fujifilm went out of its way to keep this camera as simple as possible, and while that\u2019s a good thing in nearly every other instance, I do wish I could change things like the time it takes to go into sleep mode and the sensitivity of when the display turns off by looking through the viewfinder. Those are both complaints from someone who\u2019s been a mirrorless camera photographer for nearly a decade, so there\u2019s a real chance this nitpick won\u2019t apply to you.\n\nReally, I\u2019m sure most won\u2019t find the lack of settings to be a deal breaker in any sense of the world \u2014 I hardly do \u2014 but I still wish a camera at this price would offer some additional granularity in terms of advanced settings I could set and forget.\n\nVideo leaves something to be desired\n\nVideo is the area where a lack of in-body stabilization is the biggest offender, but it\u2019s not the only issue with the camera\u2019s performance in this department. My use of the word \u201cphotography\u201d in most of this review is intentional, because that\u2019s the aspect that really sells me on the X Half, as video recording unfortunately comes across as more of an afterthought. It may still get the same film simulation treatment as photos do, but the quality just isn\u2019t fully there.\n\nCompared to the high resolution of the X Half\u2019s 3648 x 4864 photos, the 1080 x 1440 video resolution leaves a lot to be desired. If you\u2019re looking for a stand-alone camcorder geared more toward video, this just isn\u2019t it.\n\nFujifilm gets so much right when it comes to capturing the look and even feel of film photography with the X Half, but with the new Film Camera mode \u2014 which makes its debut with this camera \u2014 the company has taken that idea one step too far. The new shooting mode allows you to lock down the camera to emulate how you\u2019d use an actual film counterpart (i.e., using just a single film recipe and shooting through an entire roll of \u201cfilm\u201d). In this case, that means having to save photos to an SD card so you can\u2019t view them as you take them; you\u2019ll have to wait to \u201cdevelop\u201d them by transferring via Bluetooth or memory card.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a fun gimmick, but it\u2019s not one I think most photographers will use more than a handful of times. Luckily, it doesn\u2019t subtract much from the experience if you just ignore it, but with much of the promotion of the X Half revolving around the Film Camera mode, I\u2019m giving this particular feature a thumbs-down. If you saw a viral video showing off this functionally and were curious if the feature is actually worth being the sole reason to buy the camera, the answer is no, but if you\u2019ve read this far there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re already convinced by what Fujifilm does get right with this camera.\n\nThere\u2019s so much more to the story than just comparing the weight and size of the X Half to other cameras. The more important comparison is putting it head-to-head against some other Fujifilm cameras, of which the X Half is the most affordable. To me, that entry-level price is one of the most appealing aspects. If you want to enjoy all the perks of shooting with a Fujifilm on a budget, the X Half is for you.\n\nAs far as my personal setup goes, I\u2019ve been primarily shooting with a Fujifilm X-T5 for the past several years. If you\u2019ve spotted a photo in a review of mine, odds are it was taken with that mirrorless camera. Though, as much as I can praise it, I\u2019m still talking about a camera clocking in at around $2,300 with a lens \u2014 nearly three times the price of the X Half. So, from the pricing angle alone, the X Half is going to be the more compelling camera for anyone who doesn\u2019t need interchangeable lenses. Its sensor isn\u2019t quite as large, but it still rocks nearly the full suite of film simulation features. The only real omission is the ability to create a custom recipe, but even then the inclusion on the X Half will do the trick for most.\n\nThere\u2019s also the Fujifilm X100VI, which is a closer sibling to the X Half. It\u2019s larger than this new pint-size camera but sports the same fixed-lens design. The X100VI is also more expensive \u2014 when you can even find it in stock \u2014 and has historically been the most popular Fujifilm camera around (that is, according to the likes of TikTok and other social media sites). The X Half shrinks everything the X100VI does into a more pocketable camera, and it\u2019s one you can actually find in stock \u2014 two big perks for me.\n\nLastly, I want to compare it with my iPhone. If I go photo for photo in my camera roll, it\u2019s the camera I\u2019ve shot the most with and likely what you also capture the most photos with. Apple has even been amping up the style department of its smartphone cameras over the past few years with the more recent addition of features such as Photographic Styles. These apply effects right when you press the shutter button but can\u2019t quite match what a dedicated camera, especially one from Fujifilm, is capable of. After taking an entire vacation\u2019s worth of photos with the X Half, I can say I don\u2019t miss my iPhone 16 Pro one bit.\n\nAfter spending a week with the X Half, I\u2019m sold that it deserves a spot in my photography setup. Relying on it for an entire trip had me worried at first, as I feared I\u2019d miss being able to capture the photos I was used to with my heavy-duty Fujifilm X-T5, but those fears were quickly resolved as I spent more time with the camera, completely squashed once I dug through the photos. Having the X Half means I can now bring what I love most about shooting with my larger cameras everywhere, and that alone justifies its price tag for me.\n\nSure, at $849, you\u2019re still spending a lot of money on a camera, but the photo performance, novel film simulation features and compact size are a winning combination \u2014 and that\u2019s coming from someone who bought it for herself. As long as you can live with 1080p video recording and having to take an extra moment to steady your shots, there aren\u2019t too many reasons to knock the X Half.\n\nGoing forward, the Fujifilm X Half will be my go-to camera for everyday shooting. It\u2019s exactly what I was looking for out of documenting vacations, and I can\u2019t wait to bring it with me to upcoming concerts, hockey games and wherever else I go this fall.\n\nBelow, you can comb through 100 of my favorite photos from the trip and my time with the camera so far.\n\nCNN Underscored has a team of writers and editors with many years of experience in product testing, researching and recommending products, and they ensure each article is carefully edited and products are properly vetted.

  "summary": "Fujifilm has released its newest digital camera, the X Half, one of its smallest to date. The X Half's retro-style design and minimal 240-gram weight, along with a wide-angle field of view, can perform well in various situations. The camera was tested at the 2025 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships in Anaheim, California. After taking over 1,000 photos with it, I found it to be the perfect travel camera for me. Despite its compact design and compact mirrorless cameras, FujifilM's X Half is also a great addition to its camera portfolio. It can also be used to capture photos at events such as rock concerts and sporting events.",

  "argos_summary": "Fujifilm\u2019s new X Half is a pocket\u2011sized, 1\u2011inch sensor camera that pays homage to half\u2011frame film with a retro design, fixed 10.8mm f/2.8 lens, and a vertical sensor that makes shooting in portrait mode natural for social media. It delivers vibrant, film\u2011simulation\u2011rich images, responsive controls, and strong battery life, but lacks in\u2011body stabilization and offers only 1080p video, making it less suitable for handheld video work. The camera\u2019s price of $849 positions it as an affordable alternative to larger Fujifilm models like the X\u2011T5 and X\u2011100VI, while still outperforming most smartphones in color fidelity and creative options. Overall, the X Half excels as a travel and everyday shooter, though its limited video and lack of stabilization may deter some users.",
