  "content": "Aug 25 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Monday after Ukraine stepped up attacks on Russia, fanning concerns Russian oil supply could be disrupted, while expectations of a cut in U.S. interest rates buoyed the outlook for global growth and fuel demand.\n\nBrent crude futures rose 6 cents, or 0.09%, to $67.79 at 0050 GMT, and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 9 cents, or 0.14%, to $63.75.\n\nUkraine launched a drone attack on Russia on Sunday, which forced a sharp fall in the capacity of a reactor at one of Russia's biggest nuclear power plants and sparked a huge blaze at the Ust-Luga fuel export terminal, Russian officials said.\n\nIn addition, a fire at Russia's Novoshakhtinsk refinery , caused by a Ukrainian drone attack, was burning for the fourth day on Sunday, the acting governor of the region said.\n\nThe refinery sells fuel mainly for export and has an annual capacity of 5 million metric tons of oil, or around 100,000 barrels per day.\n\n\"Given the success that Ukraine is having with its targeting of Russian oil infrastructure ... the risks for crude oil are shifting to the topside,\" IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said Russia has made \"significant concessions\" toward a negotiated settlement in its war with Ukraine on Sunday.\n\n\"They've recognized that they're not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. That was, of course, a major demand at the beginning. And, importantly, they've acknowledged that there is going to be some security guarantee for the territorial integrity of Ukraine,\" Vance said on NBC's \"Meet the Press with Kristen Welker\" program.\n\nHowever, U.S. President Donald Trump also renewed threats on Friday that he would impose sanctions on Russia if there was no progress toward a peaceful settlement in Ukraine in two weeks.\n\nInvestors' risk appetite has improved after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday signaled a possible interest rate cut at the U.S. central bank's meeting next month.\n\n\"A risk-on tone across markets boosted investor appetite across the commodities complex, aided by renewed supply side issues across energy and metals,\" ANZ analysts said in a note.",

      "text": "The Trust Principles\nThomson Reuters is dedicated to upholding the Trust Principles and to preserving its independence, integrity, and freedom from bias in the gathering and dissemination of information and news.\nTrust Principles \u2013 the history\nThe Trust Principles were created in 1941, in the midst of World War II, in agreement with The Newspaper Proprietors Association Limited and The Press Association Limited (being the Reuters shareholders at that time). The Trust Principles imposed obligations on Reuters and its employees to act at all times with integrity, independence, and freedom from bias.\nReuters Directors and shareholders were determined to protect and preserve the Trust Principles when Reuters became a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. A unique structure was put in place to achieve this. A new company was formed and given the name 'Reuters Founders Share Company Limited', its purpose being to hold a 'Founders Share' in Reuters.\nThe legal structure has evolved over time and the Founders Share and other contractual arrangements now confer a number of special rights upon the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company. For example, (i) the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company has enhanced voting rights in circumstances where someone is seeking to obtain a significant shareholding in, or acquire control of, Thomson Reuters and (ii) the prior consent of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company must be sought prior to undertaking any sale of, or other material transaction involving, the Reuters news business unit.\nThomson Reuters itself is obliged and committed to apply the Trust Principles to its operations. The charter documents of Thomson Reuters Corporation include provisions to safeguard the Trust Principles as they apply to the Thomson Reuters business and require Thomson Reuters Directors, in the performance of their duties, to have due regard to the Trust Principles, by the proper exercise of their powers and in accordance with their other duties as Directors.\nThe Trust Principles are:\n- That Reuters shall at no time pass into the hands of any one interest, group, or faction;\n- That the integrity, independence, and freedom from bias of Thomson Reuters shall at all times be fully preserved;\n- That Reuters shall supply unbiased and reliable news services to newspapers, news agencies, broadcasters, and other media subscribers and to businesses, governments, institutions, individuals, and others with whom Reuters has or may have contracts;\n- That Thomson Reuters shall pay due regard to the many interests which it serves in addition to those of the media; and\n- That no effort shall be spared to expand, develop, and adapt the news and other services and products of Thomson Reuters so as to maintain its leading position in the international news and information business\nThomson Reuters Founders Share Company was established in 1984 when Reuters became a public company. The directors of Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company (known as \u2018Trustees\u2019) have a duty to ensure, to the extent possible, that the Trust Principles are complied with.\nThe Trustees are experienced and eminent people from diverse arenas in politics, diplomacy, media, public service and business. The Trustees are selected by a nomination committee and proposed to the board of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company for appointment. The nomination committee assists in scrutinizing candidates\u2019 suitability and its members include two persons appointed by the chairman after consultation with the European Court of Human Rights and representatives of certain press associations. The Thomson Reuters Corporation board has two representatives on the nomination committee. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company Board are members of the nomination committee, and the Chairman appoints three other directors of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company as members of the nomination committee. The Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company acts as chairman of the nomination committee.\nThe number of Trustees has to be at least 14 and not more than 18. Trustees have a minimum of two meetings per year, and receive reports on our activities in the different fields in which we operate (including Reuters news). The Trustees meet with both the Thomson Reuters Board and representatives of senior management. Through Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company's Chairman, regular contact is maintained with our company. The relationship is one of trust and confidence.\nIndependence of Thomson Reuters\nCustomers across the world depend on us to provide them with reliable and objective news and information.\nThis means that we have a special need to safeguard our independence and integrity and avoid any bias which may stem from control by specific individuals or interests.\nThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles were adopted in 1941 and include the preservation of integrity, reliability of news, development of the news business, and related principles.\nToday, the Trust Principles are fundamental to our entire business.\nMore information\nContact us\nBrian Moss\nFor inquiries pertaining to Reuters reporting standards and the Trust Principles please email: brian.moss@thomsonreuters.com."
