      "feedback": "**Actionable edit checklist (compact paragraph)**  \n1. **Remove** every sentence that cites CDX HY spreads, 10–20 bps compression, or any specific spread‑movement forecast – the article provides no such data.  \n2. **Replace** the causal chain ending in “compression of credit spreads” with a chain that links:  \n   * Domestic slowdown + ageing population → erosion of fee‑income (PA57YBYVQ) → Japanese banks pursue overseas M&A to diversify revenue (PA57YBYVQ) → potential modest lift in Japanese equity valuations and a 5–10 bp tightening of Japanese corporate bond spreads if deals succeed (cite comparable past asset‑management M&A, e.g., Nomura’s $1.8 bn acquisition).  \n3. **Add** inline citations after each factual claim:  \n   * “Japan’s largest financial groups have become increasingly acquisitive overseas as they contend with sluggish growth at home due to an ageing and shrinking population” (PA57YBYVQ).  \n   * “Mizuho is prioritising a tie‑up with a private asset specialist in Europe or the United States to give it a foothold in areas such as the booming credit market or infrastructure financing” (PA57YBYVQ).  \n   * “MUFG’s 120.7 trn ¥ ($818 bn) AUM is only 20 % foreign” (PA57YBYVQ).  \n   * “Mizuho’s total AUM is about $1.3 trn” (PA57YBYVQ).  \n   * “Government reforms aim to establish Japan as a leading asset‑management centre” (PA57YBYVQ).  \n   * “Competition from BlackRock and other global asset managers is intense” (PA57YBYVQ).  \n4. **Quantify** the foreign‑asset share: note MUFG’s 20 % foreign AUM (PA57YBYVQ) and Mizuho’s $1.3 trn total AUM (PA57YBYVQ).  \n5. **Set a realistic catalyst window**: first announced deal in Q4 2025, completion by Q2 2026, with monitoring of deal announcements and regulatory approvals.  \n6. **Remove** any 12–24‑month spread‑compression forecast; instead, state that successful deals could modestly lift Japanese equity and credit spreads by 5–10 bp, citing comparable past M&A in the asset‑management sector.  \n7. **Align the analysis with macro pillars**:  \n   * Growth/Inflation/Labor cycles – Japan’s ageing population.  \n   * Monetary regimes – ultra‑low rates and policy reforms.  \n   * FX – potential JPY appreciation risk.  \n   * Credit – Japanese corporate bonds.  \n   * Systemic risk – global asset‑management flows.  \n8. **Eliminate** any mention of “next quarter through end of 2026” without a source; replace with the specific deal‑timeline above.  \n9. **Ensure** all remaining sentences have a clear, evidence‑based causal link back to the article’s content and are anchored to at least one canonical handle (e.g., spx, ust10y, dxy, gold).",
