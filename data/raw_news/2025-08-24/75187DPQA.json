Tsinghua Tongfang (SHSE:600100) trades well below its fair value with strong projected earnings growth but carries a high debt\u2011to\u2011equity ratio.

Evergreen Aviation Technologies (TWSE:2645) sits near its fair value, offering solid earnings growth and a healthy balance sheet, though dividend sustainability is uncertain.",
