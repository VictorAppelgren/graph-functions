LOUIS (AP) \u2014 Kyle Freeland gave up five hits in a season-high 7 1/3 innings, Hunter Goodman hit a home run, and the Colorado Rockies beat the St. Louis Cardinals 3-0 on Tuesday night to snap an eight-game losing streak.\n\nFreeland (3-12) walked two and struck out two in his longest outing since a career-best 8 1/3-inning outing on July 9, 2017 against the Chicago White Sox.\n\nVictor Vodnik pitched the final 1 2/3 innings to earn his third save and clinch the Rockies\u2019 second shutout of the season after they blanked the Cardinals in Denver on July 23.\n\nCardinals starter Matthew Liberatore (6-10) allowed three runs on four hits and a walk in four-plus innings after striking out the side in the first inning and retiring the first nine batters he faced.\n\nGoodman hit his two-run homer in the fourth inning and Kyle Farmer singled up the middle off Matt Svanson with one out in the fifth inning to expand the Rockies\u2019 lead to 3-0.\n\nCardinals first baseman Willson Contreras left the game after the fifth inning with a right foot contusion after being hit by a pitch in the fourth inning.\n\nGoodman hit his team-leading 23rd homer of the season 442 feet over the lower-deck seats in left and on to the concourse to give Colorado a 2-0 lead. It was the longest home run at Busch Stadium this season. Goodman has now homered in five of his last 12 games.\n\nFreeland struck out Jordan Walker to end the seventh inning for his 900th career strikeout. He became the third pitcher to record 900 strikeouts with the Rockies, joining Jorge De La Rosa and Germ\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez.",

(AP) \u2014 Dodgers reliever Brock Stewart went on the injured list Tuesday with right shoulder inflammation, sidelining Los Angeles\u2019 most significant addition from their quiet trade deadline.\nDodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said he doesn\u2019t wish he had done more to improve his slumping club through trade, expressing confidence that the defending World Series champions will get it together in time for October.\n\u201cFirst we have to qualify for October,\u201d Friedman said at Angel Stadium. \u201cIf we\u2019re fortunate enough to do that, I think we will have arguably our most talented pitching staff that we\u2019ve ever had, with some really good pitchers left off.\u201d\nStewart will undergo more testing Wednesday, and the Dodgers aren\u2019t sure how long he will be out. He struggled in his appearances with the Dodgers this month after returning to the club from Minnesota at the deadline.\nLos Angeles is also playing without key relievers Tanner Scott, Evan Phillips, Brusdar Graterol, Michael Kopech and Kirby Yates.\nKopech, Scott and Yates are all expected to return by the end of August, but nothing is certain in another year of overwhelming injuries to the Dodgers\u2019 pitching staff. Los Angeles overcame those injuries last year to win it all, largely by relying heavily on its bullpen while several starters were out.\nThe Dodgers\u2019 starting rotation is largely healthy now, with Blake Snell and Tyler Glasnow rejoining the group and Roki Sasaki on the way. Instead, the Dodgers\u2019 bullpen is struggling to stay afloat \u2014 particularly while high-leverage veteran Blake Treinen is struggling.\nThe Dodgers also announced that former All-Star starter Tony Gonsolin had an internal brace procedure that typically requires eight to 10 months of recovery time. Gonsolin made only seven starts this season in his return from Tommy John surgery in 2023.\n___\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB"
