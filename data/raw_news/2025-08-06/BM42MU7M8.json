The concert benefit, which raised money for the Entertainment Community Fund, took place at the Shubert Theatre, where A Chorus Line opened on Broadway five decades earlier (on July 25, 1975). Baayork Lee, one of the Pulitzer Prize-winning musical's original stars, directed the event (dubbed A Chorus Line Official 50th Anniversary Celebration). A Tony Award honoree, Lee has been the primary steward of A Chorus Line since its creation, overseeing nearly every major production of the musical since. For the celebration, she remounted the original choreography Michael Bennett and Bob Avian. \"It has been an honor to spend the last 50 years of my life bringing A Chorus Line around the world,\" Lee said. \"It warms my heart to celebrate this milestone at our original home of 15 years, the Shubert Theatre.
