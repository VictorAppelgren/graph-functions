  "content": "TORONTO \u2014 Back-to-school season is straining most families\u2019 budgets this year, according to a new poll, with 60 per cent of parents saying the cost of supplies has increased since last year.\n\nThe online poll conducted by Leger this month found 63 per cent of parents say the return to school is having a significant impact on their finances, including nearly one-fifth who say the effect is \u201cvery significant.\u201d\n\nCompared to last year, 21 per cent of parents say the cost of supplies is \u201cmuch higher\u201d and only a third report the cost being about the same.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.
