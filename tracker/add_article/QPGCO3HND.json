      "summary": "China’s agreement to expand Russia’s Power of Siberia 2 pipeline and its acceptance of an Arctic LNG 2 shipment marks a decisive shift in the global LNG market, undermining President Trump’s pledge to dominate U.S. energy exports. The deal gives China a new, low‑price source of Russian gas, potentially accounting for up to 20% of its imports by the early 2030s, while sidelining U.S. LNG projects that were still under consideration. The move also signals China’s intent to hedge against U.S. LNG and financial sanctions amid rising U.S.–China trade tensions and the looming EU ban on Russian gas by 2027. As a result, U.S. LNG developers face a significant blow to their growth prospects and the broader U.S. energy export strategy.",
