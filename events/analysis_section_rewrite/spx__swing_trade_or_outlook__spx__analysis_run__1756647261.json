      "feedback": "Your draft is on the right track but drifts in a few places and lacks the precision required for a swing‑trade outlook. 1) Remove the generic “high‑level corrections” paragraph that cites (12) without a specific probability or catalyst; instead state “Shiller P/E >30× → 10–15 % pullback probability 30‑40 % within 0‑3 wk (12).” 2) Every valuation claim must link to a handle: replace “Shiller P/E ratio well above the long‑term average” with “Shiller P/E ≈ 37.9 (spx_shiller) → 10–15 % correction probability 35 % (12).” 3) The Fed‑rate cut narrative is duplicated; consolidate into one causal chain: “Fed September cut 25‑bp (3YAQ8JUPL) → 10‑yr yield to 4.2 % → equity risk premia lift (3YAQ8JUPL).” 4) The tariff and Tesla litigation sections need explicit catalyst windows: “Trump tariff announced 2025‑08‑13 (3YAQ8JUPL) → tech‑heavy SPX drag within 30 days (us_tariff_policy).” “Tesla lawsuit outcome 2025‑09‑01 (LJZYDXVL3) → SPX ±5 % within 7 days.” 5) Quantify RSP outperformance: “4‑6 % SPX decline → RSP outperforms by 10‑12 % (8).” 6) Add a risk‑reward line: “VIX >20 (9CYUOM9JM) → 15‑20 % SPX drop probability 20 %.” 7) Ensure each line ends with a clear catalyst window and probability. 8) Remove any mention of “AI investment slowdown” unless tied to a specific event (e.g., Marvell earnings 2025‑08‑29 (B1KYJ1GPU)). 9) Tighten the final watch list: “Fed minutes (3YAQ8JUPL), Tesla ruling (LJZYDXVL3), tariff updates (3YAQ8JUPL), Marvell Q3 (B1KYJ1GPU), Shiller CAPE trend (9CYUOM9JM), VIX (9CYUOM9JM), Magnificent Seven earnings (9CYUOM9JM).” 10) Finally, format the swing‑trade section into the required 4‑line Up/Down format with explicit probabilities and catalyst windows. This will meet the evidence‑based, handle‑mapped, and actionable standards.",
