  "description": "Your morning catch up: New York Post promises to shake up L.A.; millions of Californians may lose health coverage and more big stories",
  "content": "California Post mock-up handout refers to the West Coast version of the New York Post.\n\nEven as he built a media empire headlined by Fox News, Rupert Murdoch never gave up his love affair with newspapers. He even once toyed with buying the L.A. Times.\n\nThat never happened. But this week the Murdoch family announced another sort of L.A. invasion. The family\u2019s News Corp. said that early next year it will open the California Post, a West Coast version of the New York Post, the tabloid known for screaming headlines, Page Six gossip and right-of-center politics.\n\nAn infusion of populism and irreverence\n\nThe news provoked groans on the left and cheers on the right. But one veteran Los Angeles editor said that \u2014 setting politics mostly aside \u2014 L.A. and California will benefit from an infusion of tabloid-style populism and irreverence.\n\n\u201cI grew up in New York with the tabloids, and they just inject this different energy into the media market,\u201d said Maer Roshan, editor of the Hollywood Reporter and previously Los Angeles Magazine. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing for L.A. and it\u2019s a good thing for L.A. media.\u201d\n\nThe Post comes to the state at a time when the information landscape is in flux. Facing reduced advertising and weak subscription numbers, among other challenges, the Los Angeles Times has slashed its workforce, though it still maintains what is believed to be the largest news staff west of the Mississippi River.\n\nOthers, such as radio and web operator LAist, have also cut back, while new players have emerged. The nonprofit L.A. Local News Initiative plans to add more than three dozen journalism jobs, partly by bolstering the ranks of LAist, Boyle Heights Beat and other outlets. Another nonprofit, L.A. Reported, plans to get off the ground in the fall. And Los Angeles Public Press already offers a progressive alternative, with extensive coverage of recent ICE raids and other topics.\n\nThe California Post will offer something entirely different. That became clear with the series of mock front pages it presented this week. One showed a gang of minibike riders who took over a downtown intersection in late July. \u201cTAKE BACK OUR STREETS!\u201d the headline roared. Another gushed over actress Sydney Sweeney\u2019s \u201canti-woke\u201d bluejeans ad with the headline \u201cWE DREAM OF JEAN-Y.\u201d\n\nRoshan said he found during his time editing Los Angeles Magazine that audiences crave a populist take on the issues of the day, including homelessness and crime, in contrast to the \u201chigh-minded\u201d L.A. Times.\n\nThe editor said that tabloids such as the Post feed on archetypes \u2014 the several dozen characters in a city or state whom \u201ceveryone knows and talks about.\u201d That formula has helped make the New York Post the eighth most visited news website in the U.S., according to June figures.\n\nRoshan expects the California Post to also feed on \u201cthis anti-elite sentiment that is going around now,\u201d with a tone that will appeal to everyday citizens who feel left out.\n\nThe Post hopes to reach beyond politics to gain a foothold in one of the nation\u2019s bluest states. Although California went more than 2 to 1 for Vice President Kamala Harris over Donald Trump in 2024, that still leaves millions in the state (and nearly 1.2 million in L.A. County) who voted for the former reality show host. The California Post plans to wow them with its promise of \u201can antidote to the jaundiced, jaded journalism that has sadly proliferated\u201d in the state, according to News Corp. Chief Executive Robert Thomson.\n\nDuring News Corp.\u2019s earnings call on Tuesday, Thomson sounded as though he\u2019s relishing the fight. \u201cSoon,\u201d he proclaimed, \u201call will not be quiet on the Western Front.\u201d\n\nHundreds of deaths may be linked to the Eaton and Palisades fires, a new study suggests\n\u2022 New research argues that the Eaton and Palisades fires may have been far more deadly than what\u2019s reflected in coroner reports.\n\u2022 Although the immediate effects of wildfire and other climate-driven disasters are starkly apparent in hard-hit communities, the lingering consequences can be challenging to quantify.\n\u2022 Toxic smoke exposure and environmental damage stemming from wildfires can linger for months, and even years, after the flames are extinguished.\n\nTired of waiting for the city, Angelenos paint their own crosswalks\n\u2022 Angelenos are taking matters into their own hands to improve street safety by painting crosswalks at precarious intersections.\n\u2022 The city\u2019s transportation department said crosswalks needed to comply with accessibility requirements before permanent installation.\n\u2022 Sometimes the city removes the paint stripes; sometimes it moves to make them permanent.\n\nFederal agents use a Penske rental truck as a \u2018Trojan horse\u2019 to raid an L.A. Home Depot\n\u2022 Border Patrol agents raided a Home Depot in Westlake as a top federal agent warned, \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving.\u201d\n\u2022 The raids revived fears of more widespread sweeps that organizers had hoped would ease with a federal judge\u2019s order that Immigration and Customs Enforcement cannot racially profile people or use roving patrols to target immigrants.\n\u2022 Even with the most recent Home Depot raid, the number of undocumented immigrants arrested around Los Angeles has dropped significantly, according to new data.\n\nHomeowners say the Army Corps botched L.A. fire cleanups. The agency\u2019s internal documents concur.\n\u2022 Survivors of the Eaton and Palisades wildfires whose homes were destroyed feel they have been shortchanged by the Army Corps of Engineers cleanup.\n\u2022 More than 800 complaints obtained by The Times detail sloppy and inconsistent work by federal contractors.\n\u2022 Even as elected officials have praised the Army Corps for the rapid pace of work, the grievances submitted by disaster victims have called into question whether federal workers are sacrificing quality for speed.\n\nWhat else is going on\n\u2022 Millions of Californians may lose health coverage because of new Medicaid work requirements.\n\u2022 Homeland Security removed age limits for ICE recruits to boost hiring for Trump deportations.\n\u2022 UC said Trump\u2019s grant suspensions at UCLA total $584 million, a \u201cdeath knell\u201d for research.\n\u2022 A California court ruled that the UC must reconsider a policy barring undocumented students from jobs.\n\u2022 Trump officials are reopening old immigration cases \u2014 even for dead people.\n\u2022 Thousands were left without water in Granada Hills and Porter Ranch as the DWP made emergency repairs.\n\u2022 Columnist Michael Hiltzik asks: Why are America\u2019s most powerful institutions capitulating to Trump?\n\u2022 Columnist Gustavo Arellano says L.A. should pull out of hosting the Olympics.\n\u2022 Newsom vows Texas will be \u201cneutered\u201d by California. Columnist Anita Chabria asks: Will voters let him do it?\n\u2022 They snagged an L.A. dream rental with parking and nice neighbors \u2014 then made it better.\n\u2022 Bookstores: Feeling literary (or lucky)?

They will be softer but still taste good. Don\u2019t substitute red, brown or yellow lentils; they soften too much to work in this salad.\nPick the fronds off the fennel and reserve for garnish. Thinly slice the stalks and reserve the bulbs.\nCombine the lentils, celery, onion, leeks, carrots, sliced fennel and 1 tablespoon salt in a large saucepan. Add enough cold water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are just tender, about 45 minutes. If the water absorbs fully before the lentils are cooked through, add more.\nDrain the lentils if needed, then transfer to a large bowl and add the vinegar, oil, mustard and dill. Fold until evenly coated, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Let sit for at least 10 minutes.\nHalve the fennel bulbs, core and thinly slice.

      "text": "Federal agents use Penske rental truck as \u2018Trojan Horse\u2019 to raid Los Angeles Home Depot\n- Share via\nA man driving a Penske truck pulled up to day laborers at the Home Depot and told them he was looking for workers, recalled one day laborer.\nThe workers gathered around, just as more than half a dozen Border Patrol agents jumped out the back. Many of the people scattered, but 16 were arrested in the operation.\nAfter weeks of relative quiet, the immigration raid on a Home Depot in Westlake early Wednesday morning revived fears of widespread sweeps in Los Angeles as U.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Greg Bovino warned, \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving.\u201d\nBovino, who has led operations since they began in June, referred to the raid as \u201cOperation Trojan Horse.\u201d\nImmigrant advocates and city leaders had hoped such sweeps had stopped with a federal judge\u2019s order, affirmed by a U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel, that immigration officials cannot racially profile people or use roving patrols to target immigrants.\n\u201cWe are all trying to look into ... exactly what happened,\u201d said Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. \u201cBut from the video and from the stills, it looks like the exact same thing that we were seeing before.\u201d\nIn her temporary restraining order, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong had ruled that using a person\u2019s race, language, job or location as a probable cause to detain them violated the 4th Amendment.\n- Share via\nFederal agents use Penske rental truck as \u2018Trojan Horse\u2019 to raid Los Angeles Home Depot.\n\u201cFor those who thought Immigration enforcement had stopped in Southern California, think again,\u201d acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli posted on X shortly after the raid. \u201cThe enforcement of federal law is not negotiable and there are no sanctuaries from the reach of the federal government.\u201d\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials released a short statement saying the operation led to \u201cthe arrest of 16 illegal aliens from Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras, and Nicaragua,\u201d and did not answer questions. They told a Fox News reporter that \u201cMS-13 has a chokehold on this area.\u201d However, agents appeared to arrest only day laborers and street vendors, who are often extorted by the gangs.\nWhen a reporter told Bass at a news conference that Border Patrol said it was targeting gang members, she replied sarcastically. \u201cYeah, and you can see that when somebody is sitting at a Home Depot.\u201d\nBass said later she wants City Atty. Hydee Feldstein Soto\u2019s office to determine whether the tactics used by federal agents during the Home Depot operation violated the restraining order.\n\u201cJust being a Home Depot day laborer, to me, is not probable cause,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the question I would have is, what were they possibly observing at Home Depot? They were observing people looking for a job for one day.\u201d\nThe Border Patrol changed one aspect of its approach. Instead of arriving in unmarked Ford and Chevy SUVs, agents showed up in vans that could be easily mistaken for those driven by workers, and the Penske truck, often used by people moving who need extra help. At least one van had a straw hat and orange construction vest sitting on the dashboard.\nThe 9th Circuit Court of Appeals dealt a stinging blow to the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation project Friday night, upholding a lower court\u2019s block on \u201croving patrols\u201d across much of Southern California.\nA day laborer, who identified himself as Cesar, said around 6:45 a.m. the Penske truck pulled up to laborers who had gathered in the parking lot. The driver told them in Spanish he was looking for workers.\nSeveral of the men gathered around the truck and then someone, it was unclear who, rolled up the back of the truck, Cesar recounted. Masked agents, one wearing a cowboy hat, jumped out and started chasing people. People scattered.\n\u201cThis is the worst feeling ever,\u201d said Cesar, who has been going to the home improvement store to pick up work for several years.\nVideo on social media captured the moment the back of the rental truck opened. When Penske Truck Rental was asked about it, the company said it was looking into it.\n\u201cThe company was not made aware that its trucks would be used in today\u2019s operation and did not authorize this,\u201d said Penske spokesman Randolph P. Ryerson. \u201cPenske will reach out to DHS and reinforce its policy to avoid improper use of its vehicles in the future.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cPenske strictly prohibits the transportation of people in the cargo area of its vehicles under any circumstances.\u201d\nThe majority of people held in the June immigration raids in Southern California were not criminals. Nearly half of them were Mexicans and most were men.\nAnna Cho, a member of the advocacy group LA Tenants Union, was setting up a booth at the Home Depot for renters in the dense, low-income Latino neighborhood to get information about their legal rights. Lately, she said, the group has become a de facto recorder of enforcement activity.\n\u201cIt was really chaotic,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lot of yelling. There was running, and when I went outside, the immigration officers were grabbing people. It was very indiscriminate. Some were resisting.\u201d\nIn a video shown to The Times, two white sprinter vans and the yellow Penske truck arrive at the parking lot. One of the vans can be seen blocking the Home Depot driveway on Union Avenue, in a move to apparently stop vehicles from driving out of the lot. The other van parks near a sidewalk where street vendors sell food.\nIn another video, masked men in Border Patrol uniforms can be seen leading a woman in an apron away from the folding table where she sold food and drinks. She was handcuffed and loaded into the van.\nA member of Tenants Union can be heard asking, \u201cDo you have a warrant?\u201d None of the agents responded.\n\u201cIt was so fast. It happened in a matter of 10 minutes,\u201d said Xochilt Soza, a mover who picks up work at the Home Depot. She saw several white vans drive into the lot, along with the Penske truck, and about 20 to 30 agents fan out of the vehicles. Agents arrested Angel, a man whom she knew for years and who was also looking for work.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so sad,\u201d she said, shaking her head in disbelief.\n\u201cI am not well,\u201d said another worker, who did not want to give his name. He said he was devastated by the raids but that he wasn\u2019t going to leave the parking lot, because he still needed the work.\nOne worker who escaped was still shaken by the experience an hour later. He identified himself as Raul and said he saw at least eight people get arrested.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of their cars,\u201d he said pointing to a silver Toyota sedan.\nThe Home Depot had been one of the scenes of the first raids in June that kicked off more than a month of operations in Southern California in which civil rights lawyers say federal agents indiscriminately arrested immigrants. The raids gutted businesses, spread fear and tore apart families.\nOn July 11, Judge Frimpong temporarily blocked federal agents from using racial profiling to carry out indiscriminate arrests after the ACLU, Public Counsel, other groups and private attorneys sued over the practices, saying the region had been \u201cunder siege.\u201d\nDepartment of Justice attorneys argued the order hindered them from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, but the 9th Circuit upheld the order.\nCity Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez, who represents the area, called Wednesday\u2019s operation \u201cyet another attack on our judicial system by the Trump Administration\u201d and said it was a \u201cclear violation of the temporary restraining order.\u201d\n\u201cUsing a rental truck to round up people like cargo is a disgusting reflection of this administration\u2019s total disregard for human life and the rule of law,\u201d Hernandez said in a statement. \u201cIt is clear that Angelenos \u2014 my constituents \u2014 are being racially profiled and hunted for political points.\u201d\nACLU attorney Mohammad Tajsar said the organization is reviewing reports of recent raids.\n\u201cThe evidence available so far raises serious concerns that the federal government may be in violation of the federal judge\u2019s July temporary restraining order,\u201d he said. \u201cWe encourage community members to reach out if they have any specific information about these incidents and we will continue to evaluate the evidence and alert the court at the appropriate juncture of any further unlawful actions.\u201d\nThis week, a federal judge approved a court settlement barring Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers from identifying as state or local law enforcement and from engaging in ruses misrepresenting their governmental identity or purpose, according to the ACLU. That settlement applies specifically to ICE.\nFor the last weeks since the restraining order kicked in, Bovino has shared photos of arrests of undocumented immigrants, stating that some had active arrest warrants. With others, he referenced a lengthy criminal history, marking the arrests as more targeted than they had been prior.\nBut organizers say similar operations to the Wednesday raid have unfolded in recent days and have sparked concerns about violations of the restraining order. On social media, people shared a video from Saturday of Border Patrol agents seemingly raiding a Lakewood Car Wash and taking at least two people into custody.\nAnother operation unfolded Monday at a Home Depot in Hollywood that was the site of a massive raid in June.\nMaegan Ortiz, the executive director of the nonprofit group Instituto de Educaci\u00f3n Popular del Sur de California, known as IDEPSCA, said it began receiving word about an immigration operation at the Home Depot in Hollywood around 6:50 a.m. She said at least two people were arrested.\nOrtiz said Border Patrol agents \u201cseem to be making the same rounds again.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re hitting the same places they hit Round 1, if you will, and they\u2019re trying new tactics,\u201d she said. She said they\u2019re pretending to be employers and luring people \u201cas if they\u2019re street vendors themselves.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does this mean for the TRO [temporary restraining order]? There\u2019s a lot of anxiety both from workers and from organizational staff,\u201d she said."

      "text": "- Share via\n- Natalie Babcock and Samuel Gibson made their dream apartment even better with inexpensive DIY updates, thrifted goods and ample art.\n- Steps outside the Spanish fourplex, the couple has found community in the dog-friendly neighborhood. \u201cEveryone knows our dogs\u2019 names,\u201d says Babcock.\n- Babcock and Gibson decorated with treasures they found on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist.\nWhen Natalie Babcock and Samuel Gibson found a listing for a sunny apartment in Beachwood Canyon five years ago, they immediately fell for the two bedroom\u2019s charming built-in bookshelves, faux fireplace, hardwood floors and formal dining room. Practical amenities such as an in-unit laundry and a garage, which are often elusive in Los Angeles rentals, didn\u2019t hurt.\nIn this series, we spotlight L.A. rentals with style. From perfect gallery walls to temporary decor hacks, these renters get creative, even in small spaces. And Angelenos need the inspiration: Most are renters.\nToday, however, the couple says they are most impressed by the sense of belonging they have found in the community just outside their 1928 Spanish fourplex. Here, where tourists and brides in wedding gowns often pose for photographs in the middle of the street in an effort to capture the Hollywood sign in the background, Babcock and Gibson have become part of a larger family. \u201cEveryone knows our dogs\u2019 names,\u201d says Babcock, a 35-year-old educator working in the adolescent mental health field. \u201cThere is a true community vibe in this neighborhood.\u201d\nAdds Gibson, a 38-year-old screenwriter and Spanish professor and tutor from London: \u201cI\u2019ve never lived in a place that felt like a neighborhood. We\u2019re in a message group with our neighbors. Sometimes our dog walks take forever because we stop every few minutes to say hello to someone.\u201d\nThe couple was living in a charming apartment in Los Feliz when Gibson had to return to England to care for his mother, who had pancreatic cancer. Compounding their distress, Babcock\u2019s father suffered a stroke, and Babcock moved in with her parents to help her sister, Eve, care for their father.\n\u201cIt was the worst year of our lives,\u201d Babcock recalls of that period. \u201cSam\u2019s mother died, and my father had a catastrophic stroke.\u201d\nTheir Los Feliz apartment was filled with bad memories, and they were excited by the prospect of creating happier memories in a new apartment.\nAfter scouring countless rentals online, the couple found a listing for the Hollywood apartment on Zillow, only to encounter what they now describe as \u201ca feeding frenzy\u201d when they arrived at the open house. The apartment, they say, was priced too low at $2,995 compared with similar units, and they were faced with fierce competition.\nSo they decided to do what many people do when trying to persuade sellers to choose them to buy their house. They wrote a letter about themselves, included photos and sent it to their potential new landlord.\n\u201cEve and I were in a panic because the apartment was so beautiful and we really wanted to live there,\u201d says Babcock. \u201cThe three of us were an unconventional group, though, and we hoped they might choose us.\u201d\nWhen they moved into the apartment in February 2020, they were thrilled, not realizing they would end up isolating there together during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cThe apartment was a welcome reset,\u201d Babcock says, \u201cIt gave us plenty of time to nest and decorate.\u201d\nA year later, Eve moved out, and Gibson converted her bedroom into an art-filled office that now doubles as a guest room when family and friends visit. The key to a comfortable \u2014 and flexible \u2014 guest bed, they say, is a durable mattress topper from IKEA, which they store in the garage and carry into the apartment when they have overnight guests. \u201cBlow-up mattresses always deflate,\u201d Babcock says of their choice. \u201cThis is a better option.\u201d\nThe couple\u2019s taste is vibrant, and the colorful interiors reflect their sense of fun and love of design. They painted one wall in Samuel\u2019s office a dramatic Kelly green, which makes the white-trimmed windows and his extensive art collection pop. Behind their bed in their bedroom, they painted an accent wall a charcoal hue, which gives the bedroom a peaceful feel.\nDecorative tiles and sunshine illuminate the kitchen.\n\u201cPaint is your friend,\u201d Babcock says. \u201cBe bold in your color choices, and when it comes to DIY and landlords, ask for forgiveness, not permission.\u201d\nA glance around the apartment confirms not just their love of art but also the personal stories behind each piece: framed prints in the kitchen, black-and-white photographs in the dining room, large-scale oil paintings in the living room and hallway, and mixed-media pieces in the office, including works from local artists, EBay, Gibson\u2019s sister and even one found on the street.\nSkylights, vaulted ceilings and splashes of color make this ADU rental feel much larger than its 850 square feet.\nMixed in with the artwork is an abundance of lush houseplants, including Monstera deliciosa, a rubber tree and a ponytail palm, that is thriving thanks to the surplus of bright, indirect light that filters in through the large picture windows overlooking bustling Beachwood Drive.\n\u201cArt is one thing that I am always happy to spend money on,\u201d Gibson says.\nIn the bedroom, a charcoal-colored accent wall, vintage furnishings and art help to create an inviting retreat.\nLast year, Gibson painted the kitchen walls blue and installed peel-and-stick floor tiles from WallPops over the dated yellow linoleum flooring, providing an inexpensive, albeit temporary, update. (One package of a dozen 6.2 x 6.2-inch sheets costs $17.99.)\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the hardest project,\u201d Gibson says, \u201cbut you do have to measure each tile to the centimeter because the apartment has moved slightly over the years, presumably from earthquakes.\u201d\nBuilding a stunning ADU out of a two-car garage takes ingenuity, time and money. But for these architect-owners, there were also big gains to be had.\nThroughout the 1,200-square-foot apartment, the couple has decorated with vintage Midcentury furniture and thrifted furnishings and accessories sourced from Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something nice about scraping together designs,\u201d says Gibson. \u201cIt\u2019s like a puzzle where you have to patch different styles together.\u201d\nIn the living room, the couple has furnished the space with an L-shaped Bensen sofa, which they purchased at a warehouse sale mentioned on Craigslist, comfortable yellow swivel chairs they picked up from the back of someone\u2019s car in downtown L.A. and a pair of leather loungers they found on Facebook Marketplace.\nTo accommodate their love of hosting formal dinner parties, they purchased a table that seats eight, which they found on Craigslist. \u201cWe found it in a grungy flat in Hollywood,\u201d Gibson says.\nLooking for an Eames lounge chair or a Danish modern credenza? Here\u2019s a list of the 18 best places to shop for Midcentury Modern furniture in L.A.\nAdmitting her husband \u201chas become the primary household chef,\u201d Babcock takes the lead when it comes to dinner parties and \u201cgoes all out.\u201d\n\u201cI grew up around the dining-room table,\u201d says Babcock, a Los Angeles native who was raised in West Los Angeles.\nIn the corner of their dining room, across from a thrifted wooden bar cart, they installed a stone cigar table inspired by their trip to Casa Luis Barrag\u00e1n in Mexico City. They purchased it from a designer who was living in a loft in downtown Los Angeles.\nUltimately, some of their rental\u2019s decor, such as having washable sofa covers, is influenced by their dogs Chili, whom they rescued as a puppy in 2020, and Peaches, their \u201cfoster fail,\u201d whom they adopted in 2023 after a neighbor pulled her from a shelter the day she was scheduled to be euthanized.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made great friends here,\u201d says Gibson. \u201cFrom our apartment, we can walk the dogs in every direction. We can walk to the Hollywood Reservoir in the Hollywood Hills, to the caves in Bronson Canyon, to the Sunset Ranch stables at the top of Beachwood Drive, or to Griffith Park, which is a two-hour loop.\u201d\nDo they ever dream of owning a home like other couples their age? \u201cYes, of course,\u201d Gibson says. \u201cBut I think we would truly never leave this apartment unless we could buy a house with a yard. It\u2019s like London, in that, having a yard is a luxury.\u201d\nBabcock agrees, admitting that small things such as an outdoor space for the dogs or a second bathroom would be nice.\nBut it would be a shame \u201cto buy a house that\u2019s not as nice as this,\u201d Gibson says.\nIn the meantime, they are happy in their Hollywood Hills home, which reflects their love of art and their deep affection for their sweet-natured four-legged friends and their neighborhood.\n\u201cWe joke that we will die here,\u201d Babcock adds, laughing."

      "text": "L.A. never needed the Olympics. With Trump wanting in, it\u2019s time to pull out\n- Share via\nLos Angeles just can\u2019t get a break.\nThe latest embarrassment is LA28 chair Casey Wasserman, the man tasked with making sure the 2028 Summer Olympics are a massive success. At a news conference this week announcing that President Trump will head a federal Olympics task force, Wasserman offered L.A. a giant whoopie cushion.\nWith Wasserman at his left side, Trump vowed to bring L.A. \u201cback stronger than ever.\u201d On Trump\u2019s right was a rash of L.A. haters, some of whom played a prominent role in Southern California\u2019s summer of deportations, including Vice President JD Vance and Department of Homeland Security head Kristi Noem. Not present, but hailed by Trump during the presser as an \u201cMVP candidate,\u201d was Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who has made it his life\u2019s mission to crush the multicultural metropolis that birthed him.\nSo what did Wasserman, a prominent Democratic donor who in recent months has thrown some cash at Republican committees, do in front of people who want to rain holy hell on his hometown?\nHe praised Trump\u2019s \u201csupport\u201d of the L.A. Olympics as \u201ctruly extraordinary\u201d and gifted him a set of medals from the 1984 Games hosted by the city. If that wasn\u2019t groveling enough, Wasserman was grinning after Trump joked about not using an autopen to sign the executive order creating the task force \u2014 a jab at President Biden. It was more bricks on the foundation Wasserman has been laying since January, when he met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\nI haven\u2019t seen such a suck-up since the last time I vacuumed my dad\u2019s pool.\nTrump\u2019s news conference may prompt questions about whether a president with a penchant for showmanship might assume an unusually active role in planning the Olympics.\nThe federal government was always going to play a role in providing security for the 2028 Olympics, just as it has for previous Games in the U.S. But Trump, as the head of the task force, now gets to personally oversee our own siege.\nWhen asked by a reporter if he would deploy the military to L.A. the way he did this summer, Trump responded, \u201cWe\u2019ll do anything necessary to keep the Olympics safe, including using our National Guard or military, OK?\u201d\nWith the Games happening in a presidential election year, Trump would love nothing more than to traipse around an L.A. radically transformed by his deportation blitzkrieg to proclaim his mission accomplished and broadcast his conquest to the world.\nThat\u2019s why L.A. needs to withdraw from hosting the Olympics \u2014 the sooner the better.\nTrump\u2019s news conference, where he also called Mayor Karen Bass \u201cnot very competent,\u201d looked like a preview of what we can expect in the lead-up to the Games. Hey, maybe the president will fall in love with the city over the next three years \u2014 and maybe Miller\u2019s bald pate will grow hair worthy of Samson. But history has shown that no amount of puckering up to Trump will deter him from his goals \u2014 and a long-standing one is to humiliate blue L.A. at every chance.\nAngelenos: Do ustedes really want to give Trump and his goon squad more chances to make life miserable for y\u2019all? You don\u2019t stand idly by as your sworn enemy assumes even more power to mess with you \u2014 you toss that problem elsewhere if you can. And you definitely don\u2019t entrust kiss asses like Wasserman \u2014 I\u2019m still not sure what he did to deserve his powerful LA28 gig, except being the grandson of the late Hollywood mogul Lew Wasserman \u2014 with calming down someone like Trump. That\u2019s like giving a rich kid a Super Soaker and telling him to water the Huntington Library gardens.\nIn a city that has long faced existential problems, the idea of staging such a spectacle always sat uneasy with me. Boosters have drowned out skeptics by insisting that the Olympics will help the city and come at \u201cno cost\u201d to taxpayers. But the city government will have to cover the first $270 million of any cost overruns or revenue shortfalls \u2014 and where on earth would that money come from?\nIndeed, few Olympics ever turn a profit. The organizing committee behind last year\u2019s Paris Games claimed to have brought in about $30 million \u2014 which isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s just 3% of the nearly billion-dollar budget deficit that the city of L.A. faced at the beginning of the year.\nExpecting the Olympics to be a financial and spiritual salvation for the city betrays Angelenos\u2019 lack of trust in their ability to save themselves. Nevertheless, an executive for the tourism group Visit California said at a state Senate committee hearing last month that hosting the Games would present a \u201crefreshed global image of California as the most welcoming destination in the nation.\u201d\nSpare me the PR pablum. The city doesn\u2019t need a multibillion-dollar ad campaign to let the world know how cool it is or make it believe in itself. It needs people committed to solving problems for those who have to live with them daily \u2014 not for tourists and visiting athletes.\nThe city of L.A. is negotiating with LA28 over the use of police, firefighters and other city employees during the 2028 Summer Olympics. LA28 must pay for any services that go beyond what would normally be provided.\nSupporters will whine that pulling out of the Olympics at this point is a huge inconvenience and will wreck L.A.\u2019s global standing. But withdrawing from a commitment to host a huge sporting event isn\u2019t unprecedented. Denver dumped the 1976 Winter Olympics three years and three months before they were set to open, and its reputation came out just fine. Mexico hosted the 1986 World Cup after Colombia pulled out three years earlier.\nBy passing on the Olympics, L.A. officials can set aside their concerns about whether producing a month\u2019s worth of seven Super Bowls a day, as Wasserman loves to boast, will strain city resources. Wasserman and his band of the best and the brightest can focus on what L.A. really needs, not how to transform SoFi Stadium into an aquatics center.\nAnd if LA28 throws a snit fit over the move? Well, then you know how truly committed they were to bettering L.A. in the first place.\nI write this columna as a huge Olympics fan who watches the opening ceremony every four years, the Games\u2019 problems be damned. I have vague but fond memories of the 1984 Games and clearly remember the Sam the Olympic Eagle lunchbox I toted around in first grade. I was looking forward to trying to score tickets to the swimming events for my wife, who was a competitive backstroker at University High in Irvine, and me.\nBut I don\u2019t want my money going toward something that Trump will use to bolster his noxious legacy. I\u2019m not going to cheer on Wasserman as he chums up Trump while la migra continues to terrorize L.A., possibly for months, if not years. I don\u2019t want to support an event where footage of an occupied L.A. might be as front and center as the Coliseum or badminton.\nWhat true Angeleno would?"

      "text": "Disney Jr. is expanding its preschool universe with \u2018Marvel\u2019s Avengers: Mightiest Friends\u2019\n- Share via\nThe Avengers will soon be assembling for a much younger demographic.\nDisney Jr. plans to expand its collaboration with Marvel, announcing a new series launching in 2027 titled \u201cMarvel\u2019s Avengers: Mightiest Friends.\u201d It\u2019s a partnership that began in 2021 when Disney Jr. premiered \u201cSpidey and His Amazing Friends,\u201d the first full-length Marvel preschool series, and has expanded to include the upcoming \u201cIron Man and His Awesome Friends.\u201d\n\u201cDisney Jr. are the pros at this age group,\u201d says Brad Winderbaum, head of Marvel Studios television and animation. \u201c\u2018Spidey and His Amazing Friends\u2019 was our first shot at giving little kids a front-row seat to the Marvel Universe.\u201d\nCurrently in its fourth season with two additional seasons already greenlit, \u201cSpidey\u201d has been wildly successful. It\u2019s the first Disney Jr. series to run for more than five seasons and is the second most popular streaming series (after \u201cBluey\u201d) for children ages 2 to 5, according to Nielsen.\nTo make age-appropriate superhero TV, Marvel partnered with Disney Junior on research, pre-K focus groups and more. Here\u2019s how they did it.\n\u201cThe success of \u2018Spidey\u2019 really confirmed we were onto something and proved the demand for superhero stories designed specifically for this age group,\u201d says Alyssa Sapire, head of original programming and strategy at Disney Jr. \u201cIt fueled this broader strategy with Disney Jr. and Marvel.\u201d\nThere\u2019s the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and now there will be the Marvel Preschool Universe. \u201cMarvel\u2019s Avengers: Mightiest Friends\u201d will feature kid versions of all the MCU characters including Spidey, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Panther, Thor and, for the first time, Black Widow. \u201cAvengers are the ultimate learning to play nice story,\u201d Winderbaum says. \u201cIt\u2019s endless fun to watch Thor, Widow, Hulk and Cap learn about teamwork. That\u2019s always a fundamental lesson for that group whether it\u2019s in the features or the animated shows.\u201d\nYoung viewers will get a sneak peek of what\u2019s to come with two \u201cMarvel\u2019s Spidey and Iron Man: Avengers Team Up!\u201d specials. The first 22-minute special premieres Oct. 16 and finds Spidey, Iron Man and all the Avengers stopping Ultron and Green Goblin from their nefarious plans. Another special, this one Halloween-themed, will debut in fall 2026.\n\u201cThese characters are so timeless and have appealed to audiences across generations,\u201d says Harrison Wilcox, who executive produces all the Marvel preschool series. \u201cWhat is most important to us is to tell fun, relatable, positive stories that families can enjoy together.\u201d\nTo that end, next up for Disney Jr. and Marvel is \u201cIron Man and His Awesome Friends\u201d which will premiere Aug. 11 on Disney Jr. and stream on Disney+ on Aug. 12. Tony Stark and his alter ego, Iron Man, were the natural choice for the next MCU character to get the preschool treatment. \u201c\u2018Iron Man\u2019 was the film that launched our studio,\u201d Winderbaum says. \u201cWe love the idea that a young audience who wasn\u2019t around in 2008 can be introduced to Marvel through a character at the core of Marvel history.\u201d\nThis series finds Tony Stark (Iron Man) and his best friends Riri Williams (Ironheart) and Amadeus Cho (Iron Hulk) working together to solve problems, like a villain intent on stealing everyone\u2019s toys.\n\u2018Ironheart\u2019 head writer Chinaka Hodge and directors Sam Bailey and Angela Barnes discuss Riri Williams\u2019 journey, centering the series in Chicago and why diverse characters are important.\n\u201cTony Stark is very relatable and aspirational,\u201d says Wilcox. \u201cHe didn\u2019t stop until he found a way to protect the entire universe. We wanted three kids that were distinct from each other but also shared some certain qualities. They\u2019re all very intelligent. They\u2019re all tech savvy. They all want to use their brains to make the world better.\u201d\nThe trio works out of Iron Quarters (IQ) with Vision as their de facto supervisor. \u201cWe thought it would be nice to have someone who could sort of act as the caretaker of our kids,\u201d Wilcox says of including the beloved android in the series. \u201cWe wanted our audience to know that these characters were loved and supported. Even though they have superpowers, someone\u2019s looking out for them.\u201d\nEach superhero also brings something new for the young audience to connect to. One thing that will separate the upcoming \u201cIron Man\u201d series from \u201cSpidey\u201d is that Iron Man doesn\u2019t have a secret identity. Everyone knows Tony Stark is Iron Man. \u201cWe saw there was this differentiation we could really lean into,\u201d Sapire says. \u201cThey\u2019re real kids who use their ingenuity and smarts for the good of the community.\u201d\nWhen bringing these characters to the under 5 set, every detail matters. \u201cEven in this Marvel superhero space, we\u2019re always tapping into that preschool experience,\u201d Sapire says. \u201cWe take the responsibility to entertain naturally curious preschoolers very seriously. When we have their attention, we want to honor that time with them with stories that inspire their imaginations and bring that sense of joy and optimism.\u201d\nThey approach the legendary Marvel villains with care as well. \u201cIron Man\u201d features Ultron (voiced by Tony Hale), Swarm (Vanessa Bayer) and Absorbing Man (Talon Warburton). \u201cYou have to make sure the villain is not sympathetic,\u201d Wilcox says. \u201cBut also not frightening. We rely heavily on our partners at Disney Jr. for that and their educational resource group, which provides us a lot of feedback to make sure our preschool audience is engaged in the story and they feel the stakes of the story, but they are still watching in a comfortable space.\u201d\nWhile all the series remain true to the overall MCU, they don\u2019t get too tied up in what is and isn\u2019t canon. \u201cThese shows are about what makes each character tick, more than the lore that surrounds them,\u201d Winderbaum explains.\nAnd, like in the movies, the superheroes will make mistakes. \u201cMarvel does not put their characters up on a pedestal,\u201d Wilcox says. \u201cWe want our characters to reflect real people in the real world. So that\u2019s always been important to us is that there\u2019s a certain level of relatability. Everyone can see a part of themselves in a Marvel hero and learn and grow just like our characters do.\u201d"

      "text": "August Complex fire burns record-breaking 1 million acres\n- Share via\nIn an already unprecedented fire year, another record has been shattered: The August Complex fire has burned 1 million acres, the first wildfire in California history to have destroyed such a vast swath of land.\nThe Northern California blaze, which began as a series of smaller lightning-sparked fires in the Mendocino National Forest, quickly morphed into a \u201cmega-fire\u201d burning across portions of Mendocino, Humboldt, Trinity, Tehama, Glenn, Lake and Colusa counties. As of Monday morning, it was 54% contained.\nThe priority for the week will remain on the northeastern area of the blaze, which is still displaying \u201cactive fire behavior,\u201d according to Christine McMorrow, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The northwest zone, which is close to communities, is also an area of grave concern.\nAt least 3,900 personnel have been assigned to the August Complex, including aerial and ground crews from Cal Fire and the U.S. Forest Service, as well as 138 National Guard personnel and crews from as far as Montana, Texas, Washington and New Jersey.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s ready for a break, but everybody\u2019s doing what they have to do,\u201d McMorrow said of the beleaguered fire crews. \u201cI think everybody across the state is ready for a break in the pattern that we\u2019ve had for almost two months now.\u201d\nThe August Complex\u2019s million-acre milestone arrives as California shatters yet another wildfire record of 4 million acres burned statewide \u2014 more than double the previous record.\nAt least 31 people have died in the fires and 8,200 structures have been destroyed. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced as evacuation orders remain in effect in several counties.\n\u201cOur top priority is firefighter and public safety,\u201d U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Kate White said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard for the communities who have had to go through this. We want to make sure we\u2019re doing what we can and providing the support we can.\u201d\nA dome of smoke, haze and ash from the wildfires is lingering over much of the state. Winemakers in Sonoma and Napa Valley, where the Glass fire has burned through 65,000 acres, have said the effects are so bad that many vineyards won\u2019t be producing a 2020 vintage.\n\u201cAll of them are tainted,\u201d one vintner said of his grapes. \u201cYou can taste it on the finish.\u201d\nSmoke from California wildfires has ruined the 2020 vintage for some wineries\nIn Southern California, the Bobcat fire is also producing a substantial amount of smoke. Officials with the U.S. Forest Service said the haze is coming from an active fire around Mt. Wilson but noted that it is under control and burning within containment lines.\n\u201cThe public has been really understanding, but they are rightfully concerned when they see a plume like that,\u201d U.S. Forest Service spokesman Jim Innes said Monday. \u201cJust hang in there for a couple more days.\u201d\nThe Bobcat fire ignited Sept. 6 inside the Angeles National Forest and has burned through more than 115,000 acres. As of Monday, it was 88% contained, but smoke from the blaze is still contributing to poor air quality in the region. The South Coast Air Quality Management District said air quality could be unhealthy for sensitive groups Monday.\nRecord hot, dry conditions have contributed to conflagrations throughout the state. In Northern California, more seasonal temperatures and increased chances of rain are expected to arrive later in the week, which officials said could bring some relief.\nRemnants of Marie could interact with a dip in the jet stream to bring rain to California.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that the weather in is in our favor and helps put a damper on some of the areas that are seeing active fire behavior,\u201d McMorrow said.\nBut weather is only a part of the battle, as rocky terrain in several of the burn zones has also slowed firefighting efforts.\n\u201cA lot of these fires are burning in pretty rough and rugged terrain, so we actually can\u2019t get a [containment] line around them,\u201d McMorrow said. \u201cSome of these fires are going to be at 95% containment until it rains.\u201d\nControl over the Bobcat fire has allowed the Forest Service to release personnel from that blaze and reassign them to fires farther north.\nThe relief can\u2019t come soon enough, McMorrow said, as the estimated containment date for the August Complex \u2014 which is currently listed at Wednesday \u2014 is almost certain to change.\n\u201cWe are in the peak of a historic fire season, so we still have a lot left to go,\u201d she said. \u201cJust based on what I\u2019m seeing, I would expect that full containment is going to be pushed out.\u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\n- Mid East Eats, a Palestinian home kitchen in Watts, reopened July 12 with fast-casual service, offering dishes like falafel tacos and a \u201cWest Bank burrito.\u201d\n- Sumer Durkee and her husband, Andrew, donate some of their sales directly to families in Gaza.\n- \u201cI want [customers] to come and experience that Palestinian hospitality,\u201d Sumer said. \u201cThat is important to me \u2014 to show people that we are humans.\u201d\nMid East Eats \u2014 a popular falafel pop-up turned private dinner service \u2014 is now open as a fast-casual destination for homestyle Palestinian cuisine with an L.A. edge. It\u2019s also the first legally permitted home kitchen in Watts.\nSumer and Andrew Durkee\u2019s nearly 700-square-foot home on Grape Street has a white banner stretched across the front gate, with blown-up photos of pita wraps, rice bowls, tacos and nachos topped with falafel. Enter the front yard, outfitted with a few tables, and maybe one of the home cooks will greet you, if they\u2019re not busy wrapping burritos or throwing meat on a grill. Business has kicked up since the Durkees relaunched Mid East Eats three weeks ago.\nThe restaurant initially began as a private dinner service in February, when Sumer and Andrew offered Palestinian feasts in a decorated tent on their front lawn. For the July 12 opening, the pair added halal chicken and beef shawarma to their largely vegan menu \u2014 think fast-casual food like Shawacos (corn tortillas filled with shawarma, cilantro-lime hummus and feta) alongside dishes like the El Jifnawi falafel wrap, named after Sumer\u2019s father\u2019s Palestinian village, and the West Bank burrito, with fresh fries like the wraps served by street vendors in Ramallah and Jerusalem.\nFrom the ages of 9 to 12, Sumer and her family lived in Jifna \u2014 a village outside the West Bank city of Ramallah, where she and her brother went to school. The Maryland native recalls living through the Second Intifada, a Palestinian uprising against Israeli military occupation, which began in 2000.\n\u201cMy brother and I saw a lot of terrible things just by crossing the checkpoint to get to school in the city,\u201d Durkee said. \u201cWhen they would close the checkpoints, we\u2019d have to travel over the hills. \u2026 We\u2019ve been shot at.\u201d\nFor Durkee, being able to serve Palestinian food in L.A., sometimes to local Palestinians, is bittersweet. As an entire generation of Palestinian children suffer irreversible damage from starvation and malnutrition, Durkee grapples with her role and platform as an owner-operator of a Palestinian restaurant. A week after reopening Mid East Eats, she announced that she would stop posting pictures of her restaurant\u2019s food on Instagram until Israel ended its blockade of food aid into Gaza.\n\u201cIt feels insensitive to hold a grand opening during these times, but the time has come to open consistent business hours. Mid East Eats is our only source of income,\u201d read an Instagram post from the restaurant. \u201cOur grand opening is dedicated to all oppressed communities. We need each other more than ever now.\u201d\nBefore it opened as a microenterpise home kitchen operation (MEHKO) in Feburary, Mid East Eats got its start as a pop-up last summer. The Durkees served dishes like falafel tacos at events across L.A., sometimes up to five per week. It\u2019s the same food they now serve in Watts, where many residents live more than half a mile from the closest supermarket, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Access Research Atlas.\n\u201cI wanted to make food more accessible to our neighborhood \u2014 Watts is a bit of a food desert,\u201d said Sumer, whose bubbly personality and warm hospitality has helped the restaurant maintain a flow of customers. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fast food \u2026 there\u2019s no Mediterranean, Middle Eastern or Palestinian food.\u201d\nMid East Eats is one of the greater L.A. area\u2019s roughly 150 MEHKOs, thanks to a state program that was passed in 2018 and was implemented in L.A. County last November. It allows residents to cook and sell food out of their homes and plans to subsidize 1,000 home businesses through June 2026. MEHKOs are limited to serving up to 30 meals per day and 90 meals per week, with no more than $100,000 annual gross sales.\nSince its pop-up days, a common thread throughout the Durkees\u2019 business has been advocacy for Gaza. Many of the pop-ups Mid East Eats attended were fundraisers for families in Gaza, along with other causes such as local wildfire relief. The restaurant\u2019s reopening, which featured a few local vendors, raised money for two local community organizations and $100 for a family in Gaza. On the last weekend of July, Mid East Eats fundraised with sales of its West Bank burrito, donating $400 to two other families in Gaza.\n\u201cWe [donate] direct to families that are unable or too far away from aid distribution,\u201d Sumer said. \u201cUnfortunately, they have to buy food at inflated prices, so that\u2019s why I try to focus on rotating families.\u201d\nMid East Eats is best known for its herbaceous falafel, which Sumer stuffs with mint, cilantro and parsley. While she doesn\u2019t use an exact family recipe, Sumer said that it \u201ccomes from my soul,\u201d and tastes like the falafel her aunt would make. She and Andrew also take pride in cooking with olive oil made by a Palestinian family in Garden Grove.\nVanessa Guerra, a loyal customer who discovered Mid East Eats through a fundraising falafel-making class the Durkees held last year, has no problem driving from her home in Northridge to Watts for falafel.\n\u201cThey\u2019re amazing people \u2014 if someone needs help, they\u2019re there to help you,\u201d said Guerra, whose great-grandfather is Palestinian, of the Durkees. \u201cI\u2019m not just paying for the food. I\u2019m paying for the service, everything. \u2026 It\u2019s very home-like. It\u2019s like going to your mom\u2019s house.\u201d\nOpen the Durkees\u2019 front gate to find tomato plants growing along the fence. To the left is another table accompanied by fig and lime trees. Next to the house, a young watermelon plant, and in front of it, the colorful tent where the couple formerly held private dinners for $95 per person.\n\u201cI really wanted to do the Palestinian experience \u2014 I wanted people to come over, feel like they\u2019re at home, come sit on the ground,\u201d Sumer said. \u201cBack in the village, we would sit on the floor and eat. Most modern-day Palestinians don\u2019t do that anymore, but we did \u2026 I wanted to have that vibe, and I wanted to cook traditional food.\u201d\nThough the Durkees have paused the private dinners until mid-August to focus on their fast-casual service, it remains a core aspect of Mid East Eats, according to Sumer. Now, for $195 per person, diners will sit inside the tent on colorful cushions around a circular wooden table, feasting on a selection of mezze and mint lemonade followed by Sumer\u2019s maqlubeh, or fragrant rice flipped upside down, revealing a layer of eggplant, cauliflower and tomatoes.\n\u201cWhen we do the private dinners, what I really focus on is the foods that we really eat back home \u2014 the stuffed grape leaves, stuffed cabbage, stuffed zucchini,\u201d Sumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me to preserve my culture through food.\u201d\nThe Durkees continue to support both families in Gaza and their Watts neighbors however they can \u2014 which, after the reopening, most often manifests as falafel wraps and forearm-length shawarma burritos bursting with garlic toum, tahini and Andrew\u2019s homemade jalape\u00f1o sauce.\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m gonna fight for Palestinian liberation. These are my people,\u201d Sumer said. \u201cI want to bring people here, and I want them to come and experience that Palestinian hospitality, and that is important to me \u2014 to show people that we are humans.\u201d\nMid East Eats is open in Watts on Thursday through Sunday from noon to 9 p.m.\n9613 Grape St., Los Angeles, mideasteats.com"

      "text": "Post Heads West: New York Post Media Group Launches \"The California Post\"\nNew Los Angeles-Based Media Venture to Bring World Class Coverage and Indispensable Reporting to California\nNEW YORK, Aug. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- New York Post Media Group (NYPMG)\u2014home of The New York Post, Page Six and Decider\u2014is launching a new media venture, The California Post, in early 2026. The California Post will offer readers a unique and indispensable combination of fearless, common-sense journalism, celebrity and entertainment news, world class sports reporting and the legendary covers people expect from The New York Post\u2014but from a distinctly Californian perspective. The California Post content will appear across multiple platforms and formats, including mobile and desktop sites, video, audio, social media and importantly, a daily print edition.\nThe California Post will be headquartered in Los Angeles and staffed by a robust team of tenacious editors, reporters and photographers dedicated to covering the stories that matter most to the people who live and work in the Golden State. Across print, digital and social channels, the team will chronicle the incredible state of California\u2014a global power center of culture, sports, business and politics. The California Post will also leverage NYPMG's national news gathering capabilities, sharing resources with The New York Post and adding even more value for readers.\nThis new venture is launching at the right time for NYPMG, California and Los Angeles. The Post brand, influence and reach has never been stronger, with The Post Digital Network, which includes NYPost.com, PageSix.com and Decider.com, attracting 90 million unique visitors in June alone. Ninety percent of Post digital readers already live outside of the New York media market. Los Angeles is home to the second largest concentration of Post readers, with 3.5 million monthly unique visitors\u2014and 7.3 million across the state. This new masthead further positions The Post as a true national brand, substantially increasing its profile on the West Coast. The New York Post has achieved three consecutive years of profitability beginning in Fiscal Year 2022, an impressive achievement in a challenging environment for some publishers.\nNYPMG has appointed News Corp veteran Nick Papps as The California Post's Editor-in-Chief. Papps has nearly two decades of editorial leadership, and has helped drive editorial and commercial success at multiple publications. He has also served as News Corp Australia's West Coast Correspondent for nearly three years and was based in Los Angeles.\nNow more than ever, Californians need a media outlet dedicated to common sense, clever coverage of the most important issues, many of which are ignored or dismissed by current print and digital outlets. Despite its vibrancy\u2014as well as the upcoming Olympic Games and World Cup\u2014California lacks a voice that will hold leaders to account as they attempt to tackle the most critical issues facing residents. In fact, Los Angeles is fast becoming a news desert, despite being home to nearly 13 million monthly digital news readers. Thousands of stories are going untold and countless perspectives aren't being represented by a media ecosystem that has lost touch with the people\u2014especially as the city and state face unprecedented challenges and leadership vacuums.\nPerhaps that's why The New York Post already outranks the leading LA-based publication when it comes to desktop viewership according to Comscore, and is gaining ground in every corner of the state.\n\"Los Angeles and California surely need a daily dose of The Post as an antidote to the jaundiced, jaded journalism that has sadly proliferated. We are at a pivotal moment for the city and the state, and there is no doubt that The Post will play a crucial role in engaging and enlightening readers, who are starved of serious reporting and puckish wit,\" said News Corp Chief Executive Robert Thomson. \"I am also pleased that Keith Poole's remit is expanding, as he will now be responsible for covering not just New York, but California, the U.S., the world and, perhaps, Mars.\"\n\"This is the next manifestation of our national brand,\" said Keith Poole, Editor-in-Chief of The New York Post. \"California is the most populous state in the country, and is the epicenter of entertainment, the AI revolution and advanced manufacturing\u2014not to mention a sports powerhouse. Yet many stories are not being told, and many viewpoints are not being represented. With The California Post, we will bring a common-sense, issue-based approach to metropolitan journalism. We'll tell the stories that our readers care about the most, but others overlook, and we'll do so with clarity and our trademark conviction, across print, digital and the platforms where audiences live today.\n\"I am also thrilled to welcome Nick Papps to The Post family,\" continued Poole. \"Nick has a keen sense for the stories that matter, an understanding of what makes Los Angeles tick and the ability to apply The Post's unique voice to this vibrant market.\"\n\"Our content is read everywhere from the corner store to the corner office,\" added Sean Giancola, CEO of New York Post Media Group. \"We are trusted by millions for our direct and plain-spoken approach to news, and The New York Post has been the voice of the people in New York for 200 years. California is a vibrant, dynamic market where our unique journalistic ethos will resonate and engage audiences in meaningful ways.\"\nThe California Post will operate as a separate entity under the New York Post Media Group and will launch in early 2026.\nIf you are a reporter, editor or audience development professional, especially in the Los Angeles area, and looking for an opportunity to have an impact in the state of California, the team is in the process of staffing its LA-based operations.

Then last week, the mayor\u2019s office announced that the crosswalks would be painted after all.\n- Residents often take street safety matters into their own hands. In Koreatown, a group painted a crosswalk Saturday where a young boy was fatally hit by a car while crossing the street.\nThe streets around Stoner Park in Sawtelle are often filled with families on their way to the park, nearby day care and surrounding schools. Jonathan Hale, a local resident, believed the area was lacking a key safety feature: designated crosswalks.\nHale recently took it upon himself to make a fix that he believed the city had overlooked when he purchased about $200 worth of paint and recruited neighbors to paint crosswalks around the park over several weekends.\nIt\u2019s not the first time Angelenos have taken matters into their own hands to try to improve street safety by painting crosswalks at dangerous intersections. Many get frustrated by how long it takes for the city to respond to requests through 311 and just do the job themselves. Sometimes the city removes the paint stripes; sometimes it moves to make them permanent.\nIn Sawtelle, Los Angeles\u2019 Department of Transportation removed the unsanctioned DIY project about two months after the first stripe was painted, prompting an outcry among community members.\nThe Transportation Department said crosswalks needed to comply with accessibility requirements before permanent installation. Then last week, the mayor\u2019s office announced that the crosswalks would be painted after all \u2014 before curb ramps and sidewalk improvements were made.\n\u201cStoner Park is a key community anchor \u2014 a place where neighbors gather, kids play, and local events bring people together. When we talk about where L.A. comes together, it\u2019s places like Stoner Park,\u201d Councilmember Traci Park, who represents the area and urged the city to add crosswalks around the park, said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to prioritize pedestrian safety and make sure everyone can get around safely.\u201d\nCity officials did not respond to questions about whether its actions ignored state and federal guidelines. And although the Transportation Department said that no requests for crosswalks had previously been made at the location near Stoner Park, the mayor\u2019s office said that the Bureau of Engineering had received \u201cmultiple sidewalk accessibility requests surrounding Stoner Park between 2017-2018.\u201d\n\u201cThe City makes thousands of critical infrastructure improvements and upgrades each year,\u201d spokesperson Clara Karger said.\nCity agencies often have pointed to funding constraints as a reason for delays, but the mayor\u2019s office did not respond to questions about the total cost for this project, which eventually will include the installation of curb ramps and sidewalk improvements.\n\u201cWe will continue doing all we can to keep Angelenos safe \u2014 that includes pedestrians and park-goers,\u201d Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement about the announcement.\n1. Members of Crosswalks Collective LA paint a crosswalk at the intersection of 4th and New Hampshire in Koreatown where Nadir Gavarrete, a 9-year-old boy, was killed in a hit and run. 2. Signs used to control traffic are placed on the ground near the painting operation. 3. A member of Crosswalks Collective LA unloads a road closure barricade. 4. A member of Crosswalk Collective LA mixes paint at a crosswalk at the intersection of 4th and New Hampshire in Koreatown.\nThe decision raises questions about how infrastructure updates are prioritized by the city, which has struggled to keep up with a backlog of requests for street improvements amid ongoing concerns over traffic safety.\n\u201cThe Bureau of Street Services (StreetsLA) primarily uses our annual resurfacing program to determine the locations of access ramps that we design and install; we do not work off a request-based system,\u201d said Dan Halden, the bureau\u2019s acting director of external relations.\nHe said the budget for this fiscal year includes the installation of approximately 300 access ramps across the city.\nHale, who moved to Los Angeles about a year ago from the San Francisco Bay Area, was pleasantly surprised to learn that the crosswalks would be restored after his initial efforts had been erased. If the city was struggling to improve residents\u2019 safety, he questioned the pushback to citizens\u2019 own efforts.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need years of studies to tell us that there should be crosswalks and slow streets by a park and schools and day cares \u2014 those are just obvious things,\u201d said Hale, 25. \u201cIf you stand on any one of these corners for long, you\u2019ll see kids running around and you\u2019ll see close calls \u2026 I figured that the crosswalk was something that benefited people and didn\u2019t hurt anybody.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s 10-year-old Vision Zero plan to eliminate traffic-related deaths has not come to fruition in Los Angeles. A recent audit found significant failures in the program. And the budget strains on the city\u2019s Transportation Department and the Bureau of Street Services could further delay goals around street safety.\n\u201cWe have, per capita, some of the most dangerous streets in the country to walk around,\u201d said Michael Schneider of Streets for All. \u201cI think this [DIY effort] is a reaction to that and a reaction to a local government not taking action.\u201d\nSchneider said that the slowdown can in part be attributed to the city\u2019s understanding of accessibility guidance, which appears to differ in interpretation even among city agencies.\n***\nLast week in Koreatown, a 9-year-old boy was fatally hit by a car while crossing the street on an electric scooter at 4th Street and New Hampshire Avenue. Concerns over the safety of that intersection previously prompted discussion for the installation of a roundabout. LADOT solicited feedback from the community in 2021, but nothing has been constructed.\nThe Crosswalk Collective LA \u2014 a safety advocacy group whose tagline is \u201cWe paint crosswalks. The city of Los Angeles doesn\u2019t keep us safe so we keep us safe\u201d \u2014 gathered in Koreatown Saturday morning to paint crosswalks at the intersection. The group purchased the stencils that were used at Stoner Park and served as inspiration for Hale, but was not involved in his efforts in Sawtelle.\nThat evening, residents gathered for a candlelight vigil to honor the young boy who died. One of the newly painted crosswalk stripes at the intersection had not been filled in. Instead, there was an inscription in the center: En Memoria De Nadir Gavarrete."

      "text": "How Mendocino Complex became California\u2019s monster fire\n- Share via\nThe Mendocino Complex fire has burned its way into the history books as the biggest fire ever recorded in California.\nThat is saying something given how destructive the fire year has been in the state.\nBut that distinction needs to be put in context. The fire, while massive, has destroyed far less property than other recent infernos. The wine country fires last year, while smaller in size, killed more than 40 people and destroyed thousands of homes.\nThe Mendocino Complex fire has burned more than 283,000 acres and was only 30% contained Monday night.\nWhy did this fire explode the way it did?\nLike many recent fires, the Mendocino Complex fire was fueled by heat, bone-dry conditions and wind.\nIn its 12-day march, it has jumped across at least four creeks, one major road and a fire line cut by a bulldozer in a single six-mile run.\nTypically, any one of those breaks could have halted the spread of the fire. But shifting winds and brittle-dry vegetation sent flames \u2014 up to 300 feet high in some areas \u2014 leapfrogging in all directions in three Northern California counties and on both sides of scenic Clear Lake, past these man-made and natural obstacles.\nSo is this one fire or two?\nThe Ranch and River fires, at 235,000 and 48,800 acres, respectively, make up the stubborn Mendocino Complex fire. One is burning to the north of Clear Lake, the other to the west. While the two blazes have not united, they broke out an hour apart and fire officials have been treating them as one event.\nFull coverage: California\u2019s summer siege of wildfires \u00bb\nWhat kind of damage is the fire causing?\nFor the most part, the Mendocino Complex fire has been burning into forest area and away from homes. Fewer than 100 structures have been lost and no fatalities have been reported. By contrast, the Carr fire in Redding burned more than 100 homes and killed six people.\nWhy is the area around Clear Lake so susceptible to fire?\nLake County has been particularly hard hit by wildfire in the last five years. Two years ago, the Clayton fire tore through almost 4,000 acres and 300 structures, many of them mobile homes and rentals. The blaze hit the town of Lower Lake particularly hard, destroying a 150-year-old church and a Habitat for Humanity office. In 2015, three wildfires ripped through Lake County, including the Valley fire, which destroyed more than 1,300 homes and killed at least four people.\nUCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain cited several factors for the destruction in Lake County: explosively flammable vegetation, warm overnight temperatures and the lingering effect of years of drought.\n\u201cThis is a part of the state that I think that overnight temperatures have played an enormous role,\u201d Swain said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of this middle elevation where you\u2019re above the marine layer but you\u2019re not high enough in the mountains to really cool down either. So you\u2019re sort of in this zone where fires can burn, with the increase in temperatures, as we\u2019ve seen, all day and all night.\u201d\nHow does the Mendocino Complex compare to other big California fires?\n2.

      "text": "- Share via\nResidents in San Marino were stunned when a well-respected doctor and mother of twins was found dead in the scorched den of her sprawling estate.\nIrene Gaw-Lai and her husband, Yoon \u201cKevin\u201d Lai, had raised their sons in the affluent, quiet community, driving them to private school and baseball tournaments.\nBut when a fire burned in the rear of the family\u2019s home, family and neighbors wondered: How could a healthy 56-year-old be killed in a fire that never spread beyond a single room?\nBut her 16-year-old sons feared they knew the answer.\nReeling from the news of their mother\u2019s death, the boys spent that night with their aunt, saying they didn\u2019t want to be around their father, according to family court documents.\n\u201cThey were afraid,\u201d said Randolph Gaw, the dead woman\u2019s cousin and the attorney now representing Gaw-Lai\u2019s family.\nPublicly, investigators initially said little about Gaw-Lai\u2019s death. Investigators had not yet disclosed that she appeared to have been beaten, but her children were already harboring suspicions of their own.\nIn a court filing, family members said the two brothers \u201csuspect that Yoon had some involvement in the recent and untimely demise of their mother.\u201d\nNow, nearly six months after Gaw-Lai was found dead in her home in the 2600 block of Lorain Road, the Los Angeles County District Attorney has charged their father with one count each of murder and arson in an inhabited building.\nLai has pleaded not guilty to the charges and has been released on $2.25 million bail.\nFederal agents with the IRS, U.S. Postal Service, U.S. Labor Department and FBI were all part of the morning raid.\n\u201cWe look forward to defending these false allegations in Court,\u201d said Lai\u2019s attorney, James Robert Tedford, in an email. Tedford declined to comment on the accusations.\nFamily and neighbors said the family appeared to live a quiet life. Yet hundreds of court records reviewed by The Times, including sworn declarations, surveillance footage images and an autopsy report describe a strained marital relationship and contentious divorce.\nWhen firefighters found her corpse, Gaw-Lai had burns on about 60% of her body, according to a death investigation summary filed in court. Further investigation found that the mother had also suffered a broken nose, a fractured eye socket, a lost tooth, bruising to her knees and other parts of her body as well as multiple cuts and bruises. A frying pan and metal baseball bat with traces of blood on them were also found in the home, investigators wrote in the summary.\nAfter the fire, the twins\u2019 aunt was named temporary guardian. Lai has contested that order in court.\n\u201cShe has refused to return the children to me,\u201d the father wrote in a court filing.\nIn family court documents, Gaw-Lai\u2019s siblings described the couple\u2019s 22-year marriage as troubled and said that when the wife filed for divorce in August, she asked a judge to revoke the couple\u2019s premarital agreement. The divorce proceeding, according to court filings, meant the couple\u2019s real estate properties, believed to be worth millions of dollars by relatives, were suddenly at stake.\nAn endocrinologist, Gaw-Lai practiced in Arcadia. Lai, according to public records, owns his own civil engineering and land surveying business but also bought and sold real estate.\nThe two were married in 2002, but court records indicate their marriage quickly met challenges. Just months after they were married, Gaw-Lai filed for divorce, although they seemed to have reconciled by the time their twins were born in 2008.\nAt family gatherings, Lai would keep to himself unless the conversation turned toward business, Gaw said.\n\u201cAlmost every time he talked to me, it was almost always about money,\u201d Gaw said. \u201cEither how much people were making, how much he was paying in taxes or how much he didn\u2019t want to pay.\u201d\nA group of friends from Thousand Oaks were among the victims of a mass shooting in Reno this week. The men had attended another friend\u2019s bachelor party before the shooting.\nIn August 2024, Gaw-Lai filed for divorce again, citing irreconcilable differences. In court declarations, the couple\u2019s sons said they learned their father was having an affair after they looked at his phone.\nWhen asking for a divorce, Gaw-Lai also asked that their premarital agreement be nullified. According to Jocelyn Gaw\u2019s declaration, the request came because her sister had discovered that several properties the couple owned were solely in her husband\u2019s name and, according to the 2002 premarital agreement, would remain in his possession.\nRelatives said the couple talked about reconciliation, but Gaw-Lai had a few conditions before she reconsidered. According to text messages reviewed by The Times and filed in court, Gaw-Lai told her brother that Lai was \u201cbegging me to come back.\u201d\nSome of those conditions included voiding the premarital agreement, putting her name on all properties that had been purchased and requiring Lai to go to therapy.\n\u201cThat seems a lot, do you think he\u2019ll agree?\u201d her brother, Enrico Gaw Gonzalo, texted her.\n\u201cit depends on what\u2019s more important to him...\u201d she responded.\nThe premarital agreement was revoked on Sept. 7, 2024, and Gaw-Lai\u2019s name was also added as co-owner of the San Marino home, court records say.\nRelatives also told The Times that, despite her husband\u2019s acquiescence to her requests, Gaw-Lai still planned to go forward with the divorce. And as time went by, she told relatives she was increasingly concerned about her husband.\n\u201cIrene disclosed to others around this time that she was fearful for her safety if she was left alone with Kevin,\u201d one court filing reads.\nLai had moved out of the San Marino home but would stop by often to drive the twins to practice and events. Gaw-Lai would make sure the twins were around if her husband was stopping by, said Randolph Gaw.\nOn the morning of Jan. 6, Lai arrived at the Lorain Road home at 7:06 a.m. to take the twins to baseball practice, according to court documents. About six minutes later, Ring camera data submitted in court indicated sensors for the home\u2019s \u201cdining\u201d and \u201cgarden\u201d cameras \u2014 which pointed to where Gaw-Lai\u2019s body was found \u2014 were \u201cmanually disabled.\u201d\nAnd although Lai told his sons that he would be going to work after he dropped them off and would be picking them up late, Ring camera footage shows a car similar to Lai\u2019s returning to the neighborhood at 8:19 a.m., according to documents filed in court.\nAt 9:46 a.m., the couple\u2019s next-door neighbor, Connie Morris, called 911 when she saw smoking coming from the house, according to court documents.\nAccording to a declaration signed by Morris and submitted in court, she also spotted Lai inside the house. At one point, he opened the kitchen door to speak to her, acting \u201cbewildered\u201d when she mentioned the smoke.\nAccording to Morris\u2019 declaration, Lai said his wife was picking up the twins from baseball practice, but Morris noticed that her car was still at the house.\nIt took more than six months to confirm what officials hope will be the final death from L.A. County\u2019s January firestorm.\nGaw, the family\u2019s attorney, said cameras in the home didn\u2019t appear to capture video of what happened to Gaw-Lai.\nAccording to a death investigation summary of Gaw-Lai, the 56-year-old mother had suffered blunt force trauma to her head.\nInvestigators found the fire appeared to have started in the den, according to the report. One ignition point was near Gaw-Lai\u2019s body, and a second was about six feet away.\nMorris declined to talk about details of what she saw that day with a reporter but said she had lived next to the family for years.\nThe family led a quiet life, she said, and she can\u2019t remember ever hearing loud arguments or police being called to the house.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it was so alarming,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just shocking.\u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\nDecked out in a resplendent orange-and-blue-striped zoot suit symbolizing the colors of his beloved New York Knicks, Spike Lee hit the Cannes Film Festival\u2019s red carpet in May in full boogie mode.\nAs Lee and his wife, producer Tonya Lewis Lee, huddled under an umbrella and made their way through a throng of photographers, he started dancing as speakers blasted \u201cTrunks,\u201d a track from the soundtrack of his new film, \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d by ASAP Rocky, who also acts in the movie. Accompanied by his superstar partner, Rihanna, exhibiting her sizable baby bump, the rapper locked eyes with Lee and the two broke out into a spontaneous shimmy.\nWith the exception of the Knicks winning the NBA championship (they would be eliminated from the playoffs a few days later), it would be hard to imagine Lee in a more joyous spirit than the one he was in at that May 19 event. His film \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d had premiered at Cannes on the same date in 1989. It was also the 100th birthday of Malcolm X, who was portrayed by \u201cHighest\u201d actor Denzel Washington in their most successful partnership, 1992\u2019s \u201cMalcolm X.\u201d\nThough months have passed since that triumphant evening, Lee is extending his \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d victory lap, delighted that he and Washington, whom he calls \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest living actor,\u201d have joined forces for a fifth time.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a love relationship with the Cannes Film Festival since 1986 \u2014 they\u2019ve loved all my films that have been there,\u201d says Lee, 68, speaking on a recent video call from his residence at Oak Bluffs in Martha\u2019s Vineyard. \u201cMay 19, 2025, was a continuation of that. I don\u2019t think it was a mistake that the world premiere of \u2018Do the Right Thing\u2019 was May 19, 1989. I don\u2019t think it was a mistake that May 19, 2025, was Malcolm X\u2019s 100th birthday.\n\u201cFor me, some things you just cannot explain. They just happen. And to add to that, this is the first time Denzel has ever been to Cannes with a film.\u201d\nHe pauses: \u201cIt was ancestral spirits, whatever you want to call it,\u201d adding with a mischievous cackle, \u201cBut not voodoo!\u201d\nA reimagining of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s 1963 thriller \u201cHigh and Low,\u201d \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d (in theaters Aug. 15) stars Washington as a wealthy music mogul whose livelihood is threatened by a life-or-death ransom demand. (The film is Lee\u2019s first with Washington since 2006\u2019s \u201cInside Man.\u201d) The idea for an updated \u201cHigh and Low\u201d has circulated around Hollywood for several years, sparking interest from David Mamet and Chris Rock, among others. Playwright Alan Fox\u2019s New York-set script was sent to Lee by Washington, who was convinced he was the only director who could do it justice.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to ask me twice,\u201d cracks Lee. Seated in front of a Kehinde Wiley painting and within reach of a \u201cJaws 50th\u201d T-shirt, Lee, who wore a Knicks cap, is relentlessly jubilant, flavoring his comments with humorous exclamations and explosive laughter while declaring \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d as one of the most deeply felt endeavors of his decades-long career.\nThe passage of time since he and Washington worked together stunned them both. \u201cDenzel and I didn\u2019t realize that it\u2019s been 18 years since \u2018Inside Man,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cWe only found out when journalists told us.\u201d\n\u201cHighest\u201d is also his first film shot and set in New York in more than a decade. The action moves from Brooklyn to the South Bronx. A key set piece involving a subway chase (an homage to \u201cThe French Connection\u201d and the late Gene Hackman, Lee says) is a kinetic mash-up, switching between the pursuit, rowdy Yankee fans traveling to a day game against the \u201cthe hated motherf\u2014ing Boston Red Sox\u201d and a boisterous National Puerto Rican Day celebration in the Bronx featuring Rosie Perez, Anthony Ramos and Eddie Palmieri\u2019s Salsa Orchestra.\n\u201cWe were not playing around,\u201d declares Lee, almost doubled over with glee. \u201cBedlam! Mayhem! Puerto Rico is in da house! It\u2019s the Bronx, baby! The Bronx!\u201d\nThe new movie also reflects Lee\u2019s serious admiration for Kurosawa. His introduction to the work of the legendary Japanese filmmaker came while attending New York University\u2019s Graduate Film School:\n\u201cI just dug him from the beginning,\u201d Lee says. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a student of him. His work dealt with the human condition \u2014 human beings and the trials and tribulations they go through. There is morality in all of his work.\u201d The director credits \u201cRashomon,\u201d a thriller about four people who present different recollections of a rape and a murder, as the genesis for his breakthrough film, 1986\u2019s \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It,\u201d which revolved around the depiction of an artist juggling three boyfriends at the same time.\nHis vast collection of props and memorabilia contains vintage posters of \u201cRashomon,\u201d signed by Kurosawa. Lee\u2019s film is a New-York-state-of-mind twist on Kurosawa\u2019s scenario, originally based on a novel by Ed McBain and riven with tensions between the poor and rich. Washington\u2019s David King is a respected record label head grappling with a changing music industry and upset by a proposed corporate merger that he fears will move his label in a new direction and damage his legacy. He plots a risky corporate maneuver that he hopes will cement his status as a top hitmaker.\nBut those plans collapse when King receives a phone call from someone claiming to have kidnapped his teenage son Trey (Aubrey Joseph) and demanding $17.5 million for his return. It turns out that the kidnapper has mistakenly snatched the son of King\u2019s oldest friend \u2014 and driver \u2014 Paul (Jeffrey Wright). But the ransom demand remains, forcing King into a painful moral quandary: whether to face financial ruin in order to save his loyal friend\u2019s son.\nThough there are parallels between the two films, Lee is emphatic that \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d is not a remake. \u201cIt\u2019s a reinterpretation,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a history of jazz musicians doing reinterpretations of standards. We\u2019re jazz musicians in front of and behind the camera. I love \u2018The Sound of Music.\u2019 One of the greatest musicals of all time. Julie Andrews killed it when she sings \u2018My Favorite Things\u2019 and it\u2019s one of the greatest songs of all time.\u201d\nBut he emphasizes with a smile and a blast of laughter, \u201cWe\u2019re doing the [John] Coltrane,\u201d referencing the iconic saxophonist\u2019s epic rendition of the tune.\nLee also notes that the \u201c2\u201d in the title \u201cis a shout-out to my brother Prince\u201d who frequently used the number in his song titles and lyrics.\nTo Lee, the moral themes of both films are universal. \u201cIt\u2019s deep,\u201d he says. \u201cThe audience gets so much into this film, asking themselves, \u2018What would I do if my best friend, my wife, son, daughter, is kidnapped, and I\u2018ve got to put up all the money I\u2019ve got to save them?\u2019\u201d\nAsked how he would respond if confronted with that dilemma, Lee beams, rocking back and forth.\n\u201cDepends on how much the ransom is,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie, man. I ain\u2019t got all that jack. $17.5 million? You better play the lotto!\u201d\n\u201cThat is what makes the whole scenario great,\u201d he continues. \u201cEveryone would answer that situation differently. [Toshiro] Mifune laid down the foundation. He handed the baton to Denzel and Denzel took it, and did not miss a motherf\u2014ing stride. You know like those brothers in the Olympics? We don\u2019t drop the baton.\u201d\nIn addition to \u201cInside Man\u201d and \u201cMalcolm X,\u201d Lee and Washington teamed on \u201cMo\u2019 Better Blues\u201d (1990) and \u201cHe Got Game\u201d (1998). The nearly two-decade gap between collaborations has had no impact on their on-set communication, the filmmaker says, although he quips, \u201cWe\u2019re 18 years older and we both got bad knees.\u201d\nSays Lee, \u201cAll jokes aside, the word is \u2018chemistry.\u2019 We\u2019re both professionals. You don\u2019t have to be best friends. You got a job to do. Also, we don\u2019t really hang out. But once we started rehearsals, we didn\u2019t have to have a long talk and realign ourselves because it\u2019s been 18 years. We got it like that. It was like \u2018Inside Man\u2019 was yesterday.\u201d\nTaking a breath, Lee adds, \u201cYou hope and pray that you learn from experience. It\u2019s easy to say that, but hopefully you get wiser and smarter with the life you\u2019re living. How you live can definitely affect your art.\u201d\nStill, there were times when Lee\u2019s star surprised him. During an emotional exchange between Washington and Wright\u2019s characters, Washington unexpectedly started handling a hand grenade that had been placed in King\u2019s office by the prop man.\n\u201cIt made the scene,\u201d he says. \u201cDenzel is a master of improvisation. He\u2019ll get an item or prop, and incorporate it into the dialogue. I\u2019m looking at the [pages] we\u2019re shooting that day and saying, \u2018Where did that come from?\u2019 But that\u2019s his genius. He\u2019ll look around. You can\u2019t tell what he\u2019s thinking but he\u2019s going, \u2018Is there anything on this set I can use?\u2019\u201d\nThe scene demonstrated the powerful acting dynamic between Washington and Wright, says Lee. \u201cJeffrey is one of the great, great actors. To have those two together, it\u2019s gold, solid gold. All I had to do was sit back and look at the monitors.\u201d\nThe importance of family is also a component of their longtime connection and they were determined to show the King family as a close-knit unit that always tells each other \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u201cI know we portray a strong Black family in this film,\u201d Lee says. \u201cThere is connection and there is love. That\u2019s Denzel and that\u2019s me, too. You don\u2019t see that a lot. In this film, they go through hell and high water. But it\u2019s that love that keeps them together when everything around them is chaos.\u201d\nThat importance also exists between them off set.\n\u201cOur wives and families are tight. We call it the Washing-Lees. His son John David was in my film \u2018BlacKkKlansman.\u2019 Besides my wife, Denzel\u2019s wife Pauletta is my No. 1 cheerleader. I\u2019ll just make it simple \u2014 it\u2019s a blessing.\u201d\nWith the completion of \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d Lee is thinking about what comes next. Retirement is not a consideration.\n\u201cI\u2019m just getting started,\u201d he says. \u201cAs an individual and an artist, when you\u2019re doing what you love, you win. I don\u2019t see the finish line, the tape.\u201d\nOne major priority of his is to see the realization of \u201cSave Us, Joe Louis,\u201d a screenplay Lee co-wrote with late screenwriter Budd Schulberg (\u201cOn the Waterfront\u201d) about the relationship between rival boxers Joe Louis and Max Schmeling. \u201cI promised Budd on his deathbed that I would get this made.\u201d\nAnd he would love to work on another project with Washington.\n\u201cI\u2019ve stopped saying that this would be our last film,\u201d Lee admits, reversing some of his Cannes comments. \u201cIt would be a blessing to do another one. We\u2019ll see. But you know what? There\u2019s \u2018Mo Better Blues,\u2019 \u2018Malcolm X,\u2019 \u2018He Got Game, \u2018Inside Man\u2019 and \u2018Highest 2 Lowest.\u2019 We got those for the world to see forever.\u201d"

      "text": "Residents urged to boil water as outage affects thousands in Granada Hills, Porter Ranch\n- Share via\n- Emergency repairs at an L.A. Department of Water and Power pump station have interrupted water service for about 9,200 households in Granada Hills and Porter Ranch.\n- The DWP announced it is setting up water distribution centers in the area while expediting the repairs.\nAbout 9,200 households in Granada Hills and Porter Ranch were dealing with a water service outage on Wednesday after the Los Angeles Department of Water Power announced that emergency repairs were underway at a pump station.\nThe problem arose on Tuesday afternoon. The DWP said that as crews were making repairs of a leak at a pump station that connects to a 10-million-gallon tank, a valve controlling the flow of water failed to open.\n\u201cAs a result, the water flowing from the tank into the pipes serving the area was cut off,\u201d the department said in a written statement. \u201cCrews are on site and are working as quickly and safely as possible to perform repairs to the valve.\u201d\nLos Angeles uses water from creeks that feed Mono Lake. Three decades after a decision that was intended to save the lake, environmental advocates say L.A. needs to do more.\nThe agency said it was coordinating with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California to resupply the tank and requested support from a company that provides high-capacity pumps.\nA temporary fix through the contractor working with DWP could restore water service in the next 24 to 48 hours, said Janisse Qui\u00f1ones, the general manager of DWP, at a news conference Wednesday evening.\nBut the permanent repairs to the valve \u2014 which is 24 feet underground \u2014 are \u201cvery complex,\u201d and could take through the weekend, Qui\u00f1ones said.\nOn Wednesday morning, as DWP worked to make the permanent repairs, staff discovered two oil pipelines, a gas line, and large boulders that complicated their excavation efforts, Qui\u00f1ones said.\n\u201cBecause of the complexity ... the permanent repairs to the pipeline could extend over the weekend,\u201d Qui\u00f1ones said.\nThe DWP announced the problem Tuesday night and said customers should urgently conserve water, but that high water demand coupled with the restricted water flow left the tank drained by about 7 a.m. Wednesday.\nThe DWP said the affected area in the San Fernando Valley extends from Rinaldi Street in the south, to Balboa Boulevard to the east and De Soto Avenue in the west.\nL.A. Mayor Karen Bass said that, while repairs are underway, \u201cwe are making drinking water, showers and other resources available for Angelenos who may have been impacted by the outage.\u201d\n\u201cEspecially as we face rising temperatures, the LADWP and other City departments are mobilizing resources to ensure that Angelenos stay safe and hydrated,\u201d Bass said in a written statement.\nFor residents who still had some water flowing from taps, L.A. and state water officials strongly advised people in the area to only use boiled tap water or bottled water for drinking and cooking until further notice.\nThe DWP issued an unsafe water alert saying that customers should bring tap water to a boil for one minute and then let it cool before using it for drinking or cooking, as well as for brushing teeth or making ice cubes. The department said it will inform the public when tests show that water is safe to drink and boiling is no longer needed.\n\u201cWe estimate that the boil water issue may take up to one week to resolve; however, extra time may be needed due to the complex nature of the pressure restoration and valve repair,\u201d the department said in the notice.\nThe DWP said it was providing bottled water to customers at three locations in the Granada Hills and Porter Ranch area from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.:\n- Holleigh Bernson Memorial Park, 20500 Sesnon Blvd., Northridge\n- O\u2019Melveny Park, 17300 Sesnon Blvd., Granada Hills\n- The intersection of Tampa Avenue and Sesnon Boulevard on the border of Northridge and Porter Ranch\nThe department said the safety of customers and the community is \u201cour top priority as we work quickly to make repairs and resupply water.\u201d\nThe city has handed out more than 11,000 cases of free water, Mayor Bass said at a news conference Wednesday evening.\nCalifornia is moving toward a new water plan for the Delta. Regulators are supporting a plan backed by Gov. Newsom to allow water agencies to operate under \u2018voluntary agreements.\u2019\nThe city has cooling centers with restrooms available at Recreation and Parks facilities as well as local libraries.\nCity officials said the L.A. Fire Department deployed water tankers and crews to the area, and that the Emergency Operations Center was activated as officials monitored the situation.\nThe city said residents and businesses that depend on water for medical needs, such as dialysis clinics and senior centers, were being contacted to ensure there were plans for dealing with the situation, and that L.A.\u2019s departments of Transportation and Aging were coordinating transportation for elderly residents to the bottled water distribution sites.\nCrews have begun digging to access the valve 20 feet underground, the DWP said, and the repairs are expected to be completed on Friday. (The DWP is providing updates on its website.)\nAbbey Ronquillo, president of the Granada Hills South Neighborhood Council, said she learned about the pending water outage in an email Tuesday night from the DWP, but she would have liked to see earlier and more specific communication from the agency via text and email to customers in the area.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we were well informed,\u201d Ronquillo said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate there was not enough warning for our community.\n\u201cI would have wished that DWP would have given an earlier message to the community, more widespread, where you didn\u2019t really have to dig deep in order to find this information,\u201d Ronquillo said, \u201cbecause a lot of homes will be impacted negatively from not having water, of course, especially in the summer months.\u201d\nChristy Holland, DWP\u2019s community initiatives manager, said the department contacted all customers in the area who had signed up for text or email alerts.\nDWP sent out 3,400 notifications by email and text about 9 p.m. Tuesday with all the information that was available at that time, Holland said. That was followed Wednesday morning with an area-wide text alert through the city\u2019s NotifyLA emergency alert system, Holland said.\nShe said customers can sign up for texts or emails online or by calling (800) DIAL-DWP."

      "text": "Rupert Murdoch, other potential buyers eye L.A. Times\n- Share via\nWith Tribune Co. expected to emerge from bankruptcy soon, News Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch is looking to acquire two of its trophy properties \u2014 the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune.\nTribune Co.\u2019s debt holders \u2014 two investment firms and a bank \u2014 will become majority owners of the company after it exits bankruptcy, which could happen by year\u2019s end. News Corp. executives have had preliminary talks with these debt holders about acquiring the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune, according to two ranking News Corp. executives and others familiar with the situation.\nThese people cautioned that talks are in the early stages, and that a deal is by no means certain. Other potential buyers have expressed interest.\nMurdoch heads the world\u2019s largest news company, which includes the Wall Street Journal and the Times of London.\nAcquiring the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune would give him strong footholds in the nation\u2019s three largest media markets: New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.\nMurdoch\u2019s lieutenants say he has long wanted to buy The Times. On trips to Los Angeles, he is known to mark up the newspaper with a Sharpie pen to illustrate how he would design pages.\nNews Corp. and Tribune Co. have existing business ties. Tribune owns 23 television stations, including nine that carry the programming of News Corp.\u2019s two broadcast networks. Tribune stations in San Diego, Sacramento and five other markets are Fox network affiliates.\nThe Los Angeles Times also prints more than 100,000 copies of the Wall Street Journal that are distributed in Southern California, and the Tribune prints the Journal in Chicago.\nStill, regulatory concerns and potential rival bids could stand in the way of an acquisition by a Murdoch-controlled publishing company.\nFederal Communications Commission rules prevent owners from owning a newspaper and TV stations in the same market. News Corp. owns two Fox stations in L.A. and two in Chicago.\nThe FCC has been considering eliminating the rule, and has granted exceptions in the past, including a waiver that has allowed Tribune to operate both KTLA-TV Channel 5 and the Los Angeles Times.\nMurdoch isn\u2019t the only one eyeing The Times, which by itself could fetch as much as $400 million, according to industry insiders.\nAustin Beutner, the former venture capitalist and ex-deputy mayor of Los Angeles, said he has begun reaching out to civic-minded investors who would be willing to put up money to acquire the news organization.\n\u201cI would love to see The Times returned to local ownership \u2026 and provide a renewed commitment to serious journalism on issues that are important to Los Angeles and California,\u201d he said.\nAaron Kushner, the former greeting card executive who bought the Orange County Register and six small papers this year for about $400 million, said Friday that he and the investors he assembled for that deal are also interested in The Times.\n\u201cWe have tremendous respect for the L.A. Times. It is one of the few institutions in the country that has a tremendous history and heritage, and it is in an important market,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cThere would be real challenges given what The Times has been going through \u2026 but we think there are enough synergies, on the advertising and content side, to make it a strategic fit.\u201d\nDoug Manchester, the San Diego real estate developer who last year bought the local Union Tribune newspaper for about $110million, may also be a potential bidder.\n\u201cWe certainly are going to look at it,\u201d Manchester told San Diego public radio station KPBS.\nTribune Co., News Corp. and Oaktree Capital Management, the leading debt holder, declined to provide any comment.\nNewspapers are struggling amid shifting reader habits, migration to the Internet and a drop in advertising dollars. Newspapers collected nearly $21 billion in advertising last year, but that\u2019s a drop of 56% from 2006.\nMagazines are suffering too, with Newsweek announcing this week that it would end its print edition after nearly 80 years.\nBut Murdoch, 81, intends to stay in the business that forms the bedrock of his empire, which he grew from the single Australian newspaper he inherited in 1952 to the current $33-billion-a-year global media conglomerate.\n\u201cWe must not, whatever we do, take our foot off the gas when it comes to our newspapers,\u201d Murdoch said last month during a gathering of journalists in Australia. \u201cPrint will be with us for many, many years.\u201d\nMurdoch this summer announced plans to split News Corp. into two companies. The proposed breakup, which must be approved by News Corp. shareholders, was designed to mollify investors, who long have been sour on Murdoch\u2019s newspaper holdings.\nNews Corp. shares have only recently recovered from a tumble that began five years ago when Murdoch paid $5 billion to buy the Wall Street Journal, which the company later conceded was worth less than half its purchase price. News Corp. shares have climbed 24% since the spinoff plan became public in June.\nMurdoch has said the new company, which probably will be formed sometime next year, will start with cash for acquisitions and no debt to make it attractive to investors. News Corp. ended its last fiscal year with more than $9 billion in cash, and some of that would be transferred to the new publishing venture.\nThat venture would include the New York Post, HarperCollins book publishing, British newspapers, dozens of Australian newspapers, a coupon insert business, an educational materials business and News Corp.\u2019s TV operations in Australia and New Zealand.\n\u201cRupert Murdoch has an irrational love of newspapers,\u201d veteran media analyst Alan Mutter said. \u201cHe is the last of the press barons \u2026 a red-blooded, swashbuckling, stop-the-presses kind of character.\u201d\nTimes staff writer Dawn C. Chmielewski contributed to this report."

      "text": "The 10 best moments from Shakira\u2019s show at SoFi Stadium\n- Share via\nAfter a tour postponement, a canceled festival appearance and a show called off at the last minute, Shakira finally made it to Inglewood\u2019s SoFi Stadium this week on a world tour behind 2024\u2019s \u201cLas Mujeres Ya No Lloran.\u201d The album, which examines Shakira\u2019s breakup with the Spanish soccer player Gerard Piqu\u00e9, was the latest in a decades-long series of hits for the 48-year-old pop star from Colombia; here she played to two capacity crowds peppered with folks wearing fuzzy wolf ears inspired by her old song \u201cShe Wolf.\u201d My colleague Sergio Burstein covered Monday night\u2019s concert en espa\u00f1ol, but I ventured to SoFi for Shakira\u2019s second performance on Tuesday. Here are 10 highlights from the gig:\n1. It\u2019s been a big summer for the walk-out video. Like Morgan Wallen and Drake before her, Shakira made opening the show a production unto itself, with a camera following her from behind the scenes, pro-boxer-style, as she snaked through the audience in futuristic shades and a silver jumpsuit to take her place onstage.\n2. Flanked by the members of a co-ed dance crew, Shakira moved through plenty of choreography Tuesday night, none more memorably than the very convincing robot she did during a mash-up of \u201cLas de la Intuici\u00f3n\u201d and \u201cEstoy Aqu\u00ed.\u201d\n3. OK, one equally memorable bit of movement: using the arms, legs and backs of several male dancers as a living stationary bike in \u201cLa Bicicleta.\u201d\n4. As singles from Shakira\u2019s \u201cOral Fixation, Vol. 2\u201d LP, \u201cDon\u2019t Bother\u201d was easily overshadowed 20 years ago by the chart-topping juggernaut that was \u201cHips Don\u2019t Lie.\u201d At SoFi, though, I much preferred the former, which she sang while jabbing at a sparkly pink electric guitar and which sounded like Courtney Love fronting Josie and the Pussycats.\n5. Shakira performed 2009\u2019s \u201cMen in This Town\u201d for what appears to be the first time ever on Monday \u2014 the result of a fan campaign on social media that urged her to haul out the song about the sorry state of dating in L.A. (\u201cI went to look / From the Skybar to the Standard / Nothing took,\u201d goes one brutal lyric.) She did the song again Tuesday in a bedazzled Dodgers cap as a pair of video screens showed images of Matt Damon, whom she name-checks in the tune as one Angeleno not meant for her.\n6. For a salsa-fied version of \u201cChantaje,\u201d cameras followed Shakira back to her dressing room, where she sang \u2014 live or prerecorded, it was hard to tell \u2014 through a costume change and a bit of hair zhuzhing before she reemerged onstage. It\u2019s a clever set piece, which might be why Lady Gaga has a similar one in the Mayhem Ball tour she brought to the Kia Forum last week.\nThe pop superstar brought an expanded version of her Coachella spectacular to Inglewood on Monday night for the first of four shows.\n7. Shakira\u2019s strongest vocal probably came in \u201c\u00daltima,\u201d a stark piano ballad she\u2019s said will be the last song she ever writes about Piqu\u00e9. (The song is \u201ca cyst,\u201d she told the New York Times, that required removal from her body.) Here she sang it while standing in a glittering mermaid gown that seemed to make it impossible for her to move \u2014 some kind of metaphor for the gilded cage of a celebrity romance.\n8. Fuzzy, jangly, lightly contemptuous: \u201cPies Descalzos, Sue\u00f1os Blancos\u201d is truly one of the great \u201990s rock songs.\n9. Before closing the show with \u201cBzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53,\u201d her Latin Grammy-winning 2023 collaboration with the Argentine producer Bizarrap, Shakira reached back to start her encore with \u201cShe Wolf,\u201d which when you think about it is a pretty unlikely hit to have endured for a decade and a half: a creeping disco-rock thumper about lycanthropy \u2014 \u201cDarling, it is no joke / This is lycanthropy,\u201d she sings \u2014 that\u2019s somehow become an anthem of self-empowerment. Indie sleaze lives.\n10. Speaking of throwbacks, the Black Eyed Peas opened Tuesday\u2019s concert with a tidy run through some of their fondly remembered late-\u201900s stadium-rave jams, including \u201cI Gotta Feeling,\u201d which Will.i.am introduced with a little speech about the band\u2019s love of L.A.\u2019s Latino community. Said the guy known for his indefatigably cheerful music: \u201cF\u2014 ICE.\u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\n- Laurie Scott started giving away free plants, soil and seeds to help \u201cRegrow Altadena\u201d after the Eaton fire destroyed much of the city once known as a lush suburb.\n- What started with houseplants and succulents has grown to include California native plants and seeds.\n- Picking up a plant after losing so much isn\u2019t essential, Scott says, but \u201cit\u2019s that little something extra that can make life that much better.\u201d\nBefore the Eaton fire came in January, Altadena was a lush, green suburb. Hailed for its proximity to the mountains, its streets lined with majestic century-old trees, and its gardens, the community was a haven for those looking for a place to live that felt connected to nature.\nAfter the fire, entire blocks were reduced to bare dirt lots. Stand on just the right corner and you\u2019ll see clearly for hundreds of feet \u2014 views formerly full of bushes and buildings. Families have lost trees with tire swings and rose gardens that bloomed through generations.\nFortunately, one Altadenan has been working to help residents reclaim some of the green space they lost, popping up a free stand in the corner of her yard to distribute plants, seeds and soil.\nLaurie Scott, who works as an ad copywriter, says she opened her Regrow Altadena stand because plants provide solace. She and her family lost their garage and part of their yard in the fire and in the weeks that followed, she made a point of purchasing a small houseplant for herself at Trader Joe\u2019s. \u201cI grabbed a festive disco ball planter with a pothos in it, came home to put it on our windowsill, and I was just so excited,\u201d she says. \u201cIt took the empty, sterile-looking apartment [we\u2019d moved into after the fire] and it made it feel a little more like home. It brought life into the space, and it gave me hope and comfort. And I realized that if I felt that way, I probably wasn\u2019t alone, either.\u201d\nThe first months were spent finding shelter and procuring the essentials. Now, six months after the disaster, we must confront that this is our reality.\nShe started propagating succulent and houseplant cuttings, potting them in vessels she got from neighbors on a Buy Nothing group. A friend gave her a wire bakers rack and Scott started to fill it with the fruits of her labors. She officially launched her home-grown stand in March, posting on an Altadena Facebook group and inviting neighbors to come grab a little something green, whether they had a home to take it to or just wanted something small to take with them as they bounced from place to place.\n\u201cEverything was terrible, just the worst, and I launched Regrow Altadena because I wanted to help,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to make it better, even though I knew I couldn\u2019t undo what happened. The one thing I could do was make some plants and give them to people, to give them that little bit of hope for the future. So many of us have been displaced and are in survival mode, but a plant is a little luxury. It\u2019s not essential, but it\u2019s that little something extra that can make life that much better.\u201d\nLaurie Scott started her free plant stand to support her community after the Eaton fire. She offers both indoor and outdoor plants. The houseplants and succulents can feel like a \u201clittle luxury\u201d after so much devastation, she says. (Juliana Yamada / Los Angeles Times)\n\u201cAt a time when there was so much destruction and loss,\u201d Scott adds, \u201cI thought plants could represent gain and growth. And maybe even a future.\u201d\nAnd Altadena\u2019s residents seem to agree. To date, Scott says she\u2019s distributed more than 1,000 plants and 1,000 packets of seeds through both her stand and a satellite location at Pasadena boba and bookstore Dym. Other residents and helpers have been showing up to give what they can, adding everything from aloe plants to coast live oak saplings to a 7-foot Aleppo pine someone had potted in a bucket. A local ceramicist has been making beautiful pots for some of the houseplants, and Scott has linked up with several local master gardeners who have helped her access other resources.\n\u201cAltadena is wonderfully eclectic,\u201d Scott says. \u201cIt\u2019s always been one of the things I\u2019ve loved about it, so I\u2019m trying to put a whole range of plants out there on the shelf. It\u2019s really intended for anyone who\u2019s been affected, because plants are there to bring comfort and, as my 2-year-old says, they\u2019re there to make people happy.\u201d\nDesiree Sayarath says she\u2019s seen the joy Scott\u2019s plants can bring first-hand from the register at her shop, Dym. The two women met when Scott stopped by Dym after stocking her plant stand\u2019s shelves and struck up a conversation. Sayarath offered to host some plants, Scott popped in with a few, and within just a day, they were gone. \u201cAll my customers think it\u2019s really cool,\u201d Sayarath says. \u201cPeople have been starting to come back home, and they need something good to focus on.\u201d\nSunny Mills, a set decorator who lost her home in the Eaton fire, is taking tintype photos of Altadena residents at their burned properties.\n\u201cLaurie\u2019s plants really promote connection and growth,\u201d Sayarath adds. \u201cThere are displaced residents who have come in for the plants because they\u2019re still working on their gardens, coming up to till the soil and water what\u2019s left. They\u2019re keeping their plants up for when they rebuild their homes, even if they know that\u2019ll take a long time. It\u2019s like they\u2019re working on their gardens because that\u2019s all they have in their control. Their plants give them something tangible to hope for or maybe just a vision of what\u2019s to come.\u201d\nAnd gardeners say getting Altadena replanted sooner rather than later could be critical to long-term recovery. \u201cHealthy soil reduces contaminants,\u201d says Kristy Brauch, a master gardener who contributes to Regrow Altadena\u2019s stockpile. \u201cIf we can put carefully selected plants and landscaping in, we can help the soil rebuild, support biodiversity and strengthen our ecosystem.\u201d\nWhile Regrow Altadena started giving away succulents and houseplants, it\u2019s grown to include California native plants, such as California goldenrod and coyote mint. It also offers a variety of seeds for black, white, purple, Cleveland and hummingbird sages, as well as apricot mallow, showy penstemon, yarrow, California poppies, caterpillar phacelia and more. Scott is working with the Monarch Fellowship, a volunteer-driven initiative to plant pollinator flowers, to offer wildflower seeds in the fall and narrowleaf milkweed seeds and plants in the spring. Separately, Regrow Altadena offers mugwort, which can help remediate soil.\nScott says she wants to keep offering free plants and seeds, at least through spring, but her intention is to do so \u201cuntil everyone is home and beyond.\u201d Replacing mature landscaping can be expensive, so Regrow Altadena\u2019s goals will likely shift over the years as people move back home from temporary residences.\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s hard to look at Altadena and see how beautiful it used to be,\u201d Scott says. \u201cI just want to do what I can to help us find that green haven again.\u201d"

      "text": "ICE arrests in L.A. plummeted in July, new data show\n- Share via\n- The number of undocumented immigrants arrested around Los Angeles has dropped significantly, according to new data.\n- Experts suggest the drop is the result of a federal court ruling that bars federal agents from arresting people without probable cause to believe they are in the U.S. illegally.\nArrests of undocumented immigrants have dropped significantly across the Los Angeles region two months after the Trump administration launched its aggressive mass deportation operation, according to new figures released Wednesday by Homeland Security.\nFederal authorities told The Times on July 8 that federal agents had arrested 2,792 undocumented immigrants in the seven counties in and around L.A. since June 6. Homeland Security updated that number Wednesday, indicating that fewer than 1,400 immigrants have been arrested in the region in the last month.\n\u201cSince June 6, 2025, ICE and CBP have made a total of 4,163 arrests in the Los Angeles area,\u201d Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement provided to The Times.\nWhile 1,371 arrests across the L.A. region since July 8 is still a much higher figure than any recent month before June, it represents a notable drop from the 2,792 arrests during the previous month.\nThe new figures confirm what many immigration experts suspected: The Trump administration\u2019s immigration agenda in L.A. has faltered since federal courts blocked federal agents from arresting people without probable cause to believe they are in the U.S. illegally.\nThe majority of people held in the June immigration raids in Southern California were not criminals. Nearly half of them were Mexicans and most were men.\nMcLaughlin said Wednesday that Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem\u2019s agenda remained the same.\n\u201cSecretary Noem unleashed ICE and CBP to arrest criminal illegal aliens including terrorists, gang members, murderers, pedophiles, and sexual predators,\u201d McLaughlin said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cWe will continue to enforce the law and remove the worst of the worst.\u201d\nTrump administration officials have long maintained they are focused on criminals. But a few days after White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller announced in late May he had set a new goal of arresting 3,000 undocumented migrants across the country a day, federal agents fanned out across L.A. to snatch people off the streets and from their workplaces.\nWhite House top border policy advisor Tom Homan suggested federal officials adopted the strategy of raiding streets and workplaces to get around \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions, such as Los Angeles, that bar municipal resources and personnel from being used for immigration enforcement.\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t arrest them in jail, we\u2019ll go out to the communities,\u201d Homan told CBS News.\nBut after local protesters rallied to resist and Trump deployed the National Guard and U.S. Marines to the city, the administration\u2019s ability to ramp up deportations across L.A. was dealt a blow in the federal courts.\nData from the initial days of the immigration operation suggest a majority of those arrested were not convicted criminals. Most were working-age men, nearly half Mexican.\nOn July 11, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, an appointee of President Biden, issued a temporary restraining order that blocks federal agents in southern and central California from targeting people based on their race, language, vocation or location without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally.\nThat decision was upheld last Friday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. It is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\u201cIf, as Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion,\u201d the panel wrote, \u201cthey can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing a subset of stops not supported by reasonable suspicion.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to know whether July numbers signal a permanent change in tactics.\nOn Tuesday, Border Patrol agent carried out a raid at the Home Depot in Westlake, arresting 16 people.\n\u201cFor those who thought Immigration enforcement had stopped in Southern California, think again,\u201d acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli posted on X shortly after the raid. \u201cThe enforcement of federal law is not negotiable and there are no sanctuaries from the reach of the federal government.\u201d\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said her office was looking into the matter but added: \u201cFrom the video and from the stills, it looks like the exact same thing that we were seeing before.\u201d"

      "text": "\u2018Infinite potential\u2019: How this L.A. dance company is advancing disability inclusion\n- Share via\nIn a one-room studio tucked down an alley in Burbank, four dancers spin in unison around an orange-walled room. Two on foot and two in wheelchairs. It\u2019s late and it\u2019s hot \u2014 the AC is busted. But their unrelenting positivity and persistence are in full force as they prepare for a music video shoot.\nThey\u2019re members of Infinite Flow Dance, which employs disabled and non-disabled dancers of diverse identities. The company also represents an array of non-apparent disabilities including chronic illness, deafness, blindness and neurodivergence.\nInfinite Flow founder and CEO Marisa Hamamoto has spent her entire life dancing. She suffered a spinal stroke in 2006 during a rehearsal, which initially left her paralyzed from the neck down. She walked out of the hospital two months later with a new grasp on life. \u201cI saw the human body different,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw dance different.\u201d She also realized that there wasn\u2019t enough access for disabled dancers. One thing led to another, and she founded Infinite Flow.\nSince opening in 2015, Infinite Flow has performed at more than 350 events, from K-5 school assemblies to 100-person flash mobs. Their videos have been viewed more than 100 million times combined across social media.\nFrom poignant and gravity-defying duets to electrifying group routines, the dancers\u2019 differences make their work uniquely beautiful. Sometimes choreography is adapted to a wheelchair-friendly format, and other times the wheelchair is the centerpiece of the routine. The different ways you can move in a wheelchair \u2014 with the ability to roll, spin and keep a lower center of gravity \u2014 create opportunities for innovative choreography that would otherwise be impossible.\nL.A. dance organizations are scaling back their programming and outreach amid steep federal NEA and local funding cuts.\n\u201cWhen working with such diverse bodies, you by default start to become more innovative and more creative than you would otherwise,\u201d said Phillip Chbeeb, an Emmy-nominated choreographer who has collaborated with Infinite Flow on multiple occasions. \u201cYou\u2019re developing a brand new set of vocabulary from scratch, which is a really cool experience as a choreographer.\u201d\nOver the last 10 years, Infinite Flow has grown into a change-making behemoth that rests on four pillars: award-winning inclusive dance entertainment, youth education, community building and dance teacher training for disability inclusion.\nInfinite Flow falls into step with a long history of disability-driven innovation. The typewriter was invented for a blind woman to write letters in privacy. Email was created so an engineer could communicate remotely with his deaf wife. A software engineer made the touch pad to accommodate his carpal tunnel.\nToday, about one in four Americans and 16% of the world population \u2014 1.3 billion people \u2014 live with a disability.\nThe ball first got rolling on Infinite Flow\u2019s development when Hamamoto reached out to competitive paraplegic bodybuilder Adelfo Cerame Jr. via Facebook and asked if he\u2019d be interested in becoming her wheelchair dance partner.\nHamamoto said she was initially terrified to dance with Cerame but quickly realized it wasn\u2019t any different from dancing with anyone else. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dancing with someone, you see beyond the labels \u2014 whether it\u2019s race, color, size, age, disability, sexual orientation,\u201d said Hamamoto. \u201cDance is the universal language, and it belongs to everyone. We all have different bodies; we all have different identities. We can all coexist together and create something beautiful.\u201d\nInfinite Flow initially dubbed itself \u201ca wheelchair dance company\u201d and has since expanded to include \u201cjust about anybody,\u201d said founding member and hip-hop dancer Mia Schaikewitz. A spinal AVM rupture left Schaikewitz paralyzed at 15. She said a large part of building the company was figuring out how to dance with all types of dancers and bodies.\nLiving with a disability, \u201cyou learn how to problem-solve,\u201d Schaikewitz said. \u201cThere\u2019s really not a limit unless you place a limit on yourself.\u201d After being paralyzed, she went through a trial and error process to \u201c[make] the chair work for me.\u201d After countless trips to Home Depot looking for the right material to secure her feet to the chair\u2019s footplate during dances, \u201cI finally found the perfect Velcro,\u201d she laughed. Because of her experimentation, everyone at Infinite Flow now uses the same adhesive.\nFast forward to today: Infinite Flow is finalizing its latest routine, \u201cBack to the Boyband.\u201d The piece was spearheaded by Danny J. Gomez, actor turned Infinite Flow dancer, as part of the \u201cconcept project\u201d initiative, where dancers execute projects with more creative freedom.\nAfter five rehearsals, ample workshopping of the choreography and music (a mashup of boy band hits from over the years) and stretching a bootstrapped budget, the project came to fruition. The routine, Gomez said, came out of his love \u2014 and perhaps nostalgia \u2014 for boy band culture, but also the lack of representation for disabled male dancers. \u201cMost men, when they recover from an injury, turn to sports, not art,\u201d said Gomez, who\u2019s paraplegic.\nFellow \u201cBack to the Boyband\u201d dancer Travis Ammann noted that a lot of talk about the intersection of disability and dance \u201ccan be really serious. This is just boys having fun. It\u2019s important for people to see.\u201d\nInfinite Flow is proud to be based in L.A., but the Hollywood backdrop has its cons. The industry often dismisses dancers because of their body type, ethnicity or race. Many are accustomed to being told that they simply \u201cdon\u2019t look the part,\u201d said Hamamoto.\n\u201cI felt bullied when I came to L.A.\u201d Gomez said. But starting at Infinite Flow felt \u201clike I just rolled into this family.\u201d\nInfinite Flow has nurtured a tight-knit community and is inclusive in more ways than one. \u201cThe dance class culture in L.A. isn\u2019t always very positive,\u201d Hamamoto said. \u201cA lot of these dance classes feel more like an audition. It\u2019s intimidating.\u201d\nFrom \u2018America\u2019s Got Talent\u2019 to their Las Vegas residency, the magician duo the Clairvoyants have a long streak of reading minds and blowing minds too. Their ambitious winter tour aims to spread holiday magic from coast to coast.\n\u201cWe eliminate all of that and say, \u2018This is a safe space. If you\u2019ve got a chronic illness and you need to rest, you can rest whenever you want.\u2019 We have a way to teach people with various learning styles,\u201d she said.\nThere are a lot of dancers in L.A. who want to stand out and be seen, Schaikewitz noted. \u201cWe naturally stand out because we are different, but we\u2019re just being ourselves.\u201d\nTo celebrate its 10th anniversary, the group released a video Monday as part of a larger campaign to use dance as a vehicle to advance disability inclusion. Hamamoto enlisted Chbeeb to collaborate with her on a bird\u2019s-eye view video, a format he has been exploring throughout his career.\nHamamoto originally envisioned a top-down view over four wheelchair dancers. Eventually, the \u201cEnvision\u201d project evolved into a modern piece inspired by director and choreographer Busby Berkeley \u2014 kaleidoscopic and filmed from above, with synchronized dancers forming geometric patterns. Infinite Flow\u2019s version featured nine dancers, four of whom used wheelchairs and five who did not.\n\u201cThere is really infinite \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 potential with utilizing wheelchairs in unique, different capacities that I don\u2019t think necessarily have been used,\u201d said Chbeeb. \u201cParticularly on the floor, which was a really fun, different way of approaching aerial view work.\u201d\nThe dance company is using its anniversary \u2014 which also coincides with the 35th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act \u2014 as an opportunity to look toward its bright future. \u201cIn the next 10 years, I definitely want to expand our filmmaking, our content creation,\u201d Hamamoto said. \u201cOn the stage side, I\u2019m always thinking, \u2018How can we be the Cirque du Soleil of what we do?\u2019\u201d\nThe team behind Infinite Flow also has Olympic aspirations. \u201cMy hope is that we\u2019re fully immersed and involved in the Paralympic and Olympic opening ceremonies,\u201d said Hamamoto. \u201cAt Infinite Flow, we are disability-led, specifically BIPOC disability-led. For anything on [the Olympics\u2019] scale, it\u2019s really important to have disabled people, disabled artists or anyone doing this work, to be at the forefront of making decisions.\u201d\nHamamoto and Schaikewitz share a vision for the company\u2019s future: to get to a point where Infinite Flow isn\u2019t considered a \u201cdifferent\u201d dance company. \u201cI hope all dance companies are as inclusive and so it really won\u2019t be so unique. I see that, hopefully, for the world in general.\u201d"

      "text": "UC must reconsider policy barring undocumented students from jobs, court rules\n- Share via\nIn a key win for immigrant rights organizations, a California Court of Appeal ruled that the University of California has not provided sufficient legal grounds to justify its \u201cdiscriminatory policy\u201d barring the hiring of undocumented students from on-campus jobs.\nA UCLA alumnus and a lecturer filed a lawsuit in October arguing that the UC system\u2019s hiring policy violates state law because it discriminates against students based on their immigration status.\nPlaintiffs said that, without access to campus jobs, many undocumented students struggle to meet tuition costs and cover basic needs such as housing and food. These students are often forced into the underground economy and miss out on career-advancing opportunities such as research assistant positions.\nAttorneys representing the UC system argued that its policy is justified because hiring undocumented students could run afoul of a federal law that bans the hiring of people without legal status and may provoke retaliation from the federal government.\nA three-judge panel, however, ruled that the system\u2019s policy violates California\u2019s Fair Employment and Housing Act and that fear of federal litigation is not sufficient grounds to uphold it.\n\u201cThe University does not assert that it relied on the requirements of a federal statute or regulation in deciding to not to amend its policy \u2014 only on the risks associated with adopting a policy that the federal government might consider unlawful,\u201d states the ruling. \u201cAccordingly, we conclude that the University abused its discretion by relying on an improper justification for continued application of its facially discriminatory policy.\u201d\nThe panel stopped short of ruling that UC must overturn its policy; rather, it ordered that the university system reconsider the policy based on proper legal criteria.\nAfter Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have allowed undocumented students to be hired on public universities, a legal effort has been launched to force open this doorway.\nAttorneys representing the plaintiffs consider the ruling a victory and are calling on UC to open jobs to undocumented students.\n\u201cThe court\u2019s powerful opinion rejects the UC\u2019s attempt to justify its policy discriminating against undocumented students. It is wrong \u2014 both morally and legally \u2014 to bar our state\u2019s most talented students from access to crucial educational employment opportunities based on their immigration status,\u201d said Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of UCLA\u2019s Center for Immigration Law and Policy, in a statement. \u201cWe call on the UC to comply with state law and treat all its students equally, regardless of immigration status.\u201d\nThe UC system said it is reviewing the court\u2019s ruling but has not commented on whether it will change its hiring policy.\n\u201cTo the extent it\u2019s compliant with the law, the University continues to believe undocumented students deserve the same opportunities as our other students,\u201d said UC spokesperson Stett Holbrook in a statement.\nUniversity officials have previously expressed fear that changing the system\u2019s hiring policy could result in civil fines, criminal penalties and the potential loss of billions of dollars in federal funding. Last week, the Trump administration announced it was freezing hundreds of millions of dollars in federal research funding to UCLA, citing concerns over antisemitism and the university\u2019s handling of pro-Palestinian protests.\nUCLA and University of California officials said Monday that it will negotiate with Trump over $339 million in medical and science grant freezes.\nTuesday\u2019s court ruling comes after a years-long push to open campus jobs to students lacking documentation.\nThe debate over whether it is legal to do so revolves around the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which bars the hiring of people without legal status.\nThe plaintiffs in the lawsuit argue that this federal law does not apply to government employers such as the UC system. Attorneys representing UC did not argue that the IRCA applies to public universities but said that the federal government might believe it does.\nIn Tuesday\u2019s ruling, the three-judge panel noted that UC had the option to file a lawsuit against the federal government to secure a court ruling on whether the university system is subject to the IRCA.\nUnder the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy \u2014 better known as DACA \u2014 undocumented youth who were brought to the United States as children could get work permits. The UC system does allow the hiring of undocumented students with work authorization.\nBoth UC and CSU had expressed concerns about the bill, saying it could cause them to run afoul of federal law.\nPresident Trump, however, terminated the DACA program in 2017, and although courts have challenged that decision, the program is no longer accepting new applicants.\nThere are now around 64,300 undocumented college students who are not eligible for DACA in California and, therefore, not eligible for work authorization \u2014 or campus jobs.\n\u201cAs someone who was undocumented and a UC lecturer, I know firsthand the transformative power of on-campus work opportunities,\u201d said plaintiff Iliana G. Perez in a statement on the court ruling. \u201cUC must now act with urgency to dismantle exclusionary policies and ensure all students, regardless of immigration status, can fully participate in their education, contribute to their campuses, and shape California\u2019s future.\u201d\nStudents and faculty began advocating for the UC system to open jobs to all students regardless of their immigration status in 2022.\nThe UC regents established a working group to consider change its hiring policy in 2023, but the group suspended its work due to fear that doing so would violate the IRCA.\nA year later, the California Legislature passed the Opportunity for All Act, requiring state public universities to open up employment to all students, but Newsom vetoed the bill, citing legal concerns over the IRCA.\nThis prompted the plaintiffs to file their lawsuit in October seeking a writ of mandate requiring the UC system to consider undocumented students for on-campus jobs. A court initially denied this request, but the plaintiffs appealed the decision to the California Supreme Court, which then ordered the state Court of Appeal to rule on the merits of the case. The Court of Appeal heard oral arguments in May and issued its ruling Tuesday."

      "text": "Trump officials are reopening old immigration cases, even for dead people. \u2018They don\u2019t do their homework,\u2019 lawyers say\n- Share via\n- The Trump administration says it is simply stepping up enforcement of immigration rules and procedures the Biden administration ignored.\n- Some lawyers say the administration is deliberately seeking to overwhelm the courts, making it harder for immigrants to oppose deportation proceedings. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t getting due process,\u201d one said.\nA decade ago, Jesus Adan Rico breathed a big sigh of relief. That was when the Chino High School student, a Dreamer, learned an immigration judge had effectively shelved his deportation proceedings. Maria Torres, who came to the U.S. at 2 years old, also had her deportation proceedings paused by an immigration judge because she recently married a U.S. citizen.\nYet just eight weeks ago, Adan Rico \u2014 now 29, married with a new child \u2014 discovered that the Trump administration had revived his deportation case, even though he has renewed his DACA status at least four times. Torres learned the government wants to bring back her case just as she was preparing for her green card interview.\n\u201cNo matter what we do, no matter how far we go in school, in our jobs and with our families, it doesn\u2019t matter. It is all hanging by a thread,\u201d he said.\nAdan Rico and Torres are among thousands of immigrants who have built lives around the assumption they are safe from being detained and deported. Now they face that threat at the hands of the Department of Homeland Security, which is giving new life to administratively closed cases in a bid to step up immigration enforcement.\nSome lawyers have received dozens of motions to recalendar \u2014 the first step to reopen old cases. If lawyers don\u2019t succeed in opposing those motions, the immigrants could wind up back in courthouses that in recent months have become a hub for arrests.\n\u201cIt has been 10 years,\u201d Adan Rico said. \u201cAnd all of a sudden our lives are on hold again, at the mercy of these people that think I have no right to be here.\u201d\nWhen asked about the government\u2019s push to restart old proceedings, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin declined to address questions about the administration\u2019s change in policy or respond to attorneys\u2019 complaints about the process. She released a statement similar to others she has offered to the media on immigration inquiries.\n\u201cBiden chose to release millions of illegal aliens, including criminals, into the country and used prosecutorial discretion to indefinitely delay their cases and allow them to illegally remain in the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, President Trump and Secretary Noem are following the law and resuming these illegal aliens\u2019 removal proceedings and ensuring their cases are heard by a judge.\u201d\nAttorneys handling these proceedings say the government is overwhelming the courts and immigration lawyers by dredging up cases, many of which are a decade or more old. In several of these, clients or their original lawyers have died. In other cases, immigrants have received legal status and were surprised to learn the government was attempting to revive deportation proceedings against them.\nHelp desks at immigration courts disappear along with other basic legal services as Trump administration ramps up deportation efforts.\nSince the 1970s, immigration judges have administratively closed deportation proceedings in order to ease the massive backlog on their dockets and prioritize more urgent cases. The maneuver essentially deferred a case, but didn\u2019t completely dismiss it, giving both the court and the immigrant wiggle room. The idea was that immigrants could pursue other forms of relief such as a hardship waiver or deferred status. The government could reopen the case if needed.\nAcross the country, immigration attorneys have received a flurry of requests by Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Principal Legal Advisor to revive cases. The motions, attorneys say, appear similar in language, and lack analysis or reference to a change that prompted the decision. In their motions, Trump administration lawyers argue that the targeted immigrants have not been granted green cards and therefore do not have legal status to be here.\nThe motions urge immigration judges to use their discretion to revive cases and consider whether a person has been detained or the pending application\u2019s \u201cultimate outcome or likelihood of success.\u201d\nWhat distinguishes immigration proceedings from cases in federal or state courts is that both the lawyers and the judges are part of the executive branch, not the judiciary branch. They answer to Secretary Kristi Noem and Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi, respectively.\nAttorneys and clients are racing against the clock to submit opposition to these motions. Many have become in essence private investigators, tracking down clients they haven\u2019t seen in years. Other attorneys, who have retired, are looking to other immigration attorneys to pick up their client\u2019s case.\n\u201cThe court is drowning in these motions because we\u2019re trying to resist these,\u201d said David L. Wilson, an immigration attorney at Wilson Law Group in Minneapolis. He first received a batch of 25 government motions at the end of May \u2014 and then they kept coming every few weeks. One case involved a client from El Salvador who had been granted Temporary Protected Status, and whose case was administratively closed in 2006.\nAdan Rico, a new father who is studying to be an HVAC technician in the Inland Empire, was stunned that the government was seeking to revive deportation proceedings.\nThe attorney who originally represented him has since died. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for his daughter calling, I would have never found out my case was reopened,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security never sent me anything.\u201d\nHis new attorney, Patricia Corrales, said Adan Rico\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status doesn\u2019t come up for renewal until 2027 and it defers deportation proceedings. But Corrales, who has received about a dozen motions, said it appears the government isn\u2019t even checking whether the individuals are alive, much less their immigration status.\nOne of her cases is that of construction worker Helario Romero Arciniega. Seven years ago, a judge administratively closed deportation proceedings for Romero Arciniega, after he was severely beaten with a metal sprinkler head and had qualified for a visa for crime victims.\nThis year, government officials filed a motion to bring back the deportation proceedings against the construction worker, even though he had died six months ago.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t do their homework,\u201d Corrales said of the government lawyers. \u201cThey\u2019re very negligent in the manner in which they\u2019re handling these motions to re-calendar.\u201d\nSome attorneys have reported delays in their ability to file their opposition motions because the court is so overwhelmed.\nWhen asked about the backlog, Kathryn Mattingly, a spokesperson for the federal immigration court known as the Executive Office for Immigration Review, confirmed that the court \u201cmust receive the underlying initial motion before it can accept a response to that motion.\u201d\nSome immigrants now in legal limbo were just steps away from finalizing their green card applications.\nThe woman, a 38-year-old single mother of three children with U.S. citizenship, has been in the U.S. since she was 9 years old.\nMaria Torres, an L.A. County resident and mother of two, said she was only 2 years old when she was brought to the U.S. by her family. She grew up undocumented, and when the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program became available, applied to gain work authorization.\nBut in 2019, at 21, she was arrested on suspicion of a misdemeanor DUI, which put her into deportation proceedings. She took the classes and paid her ticket. With deportation proceedings open against her, she was able to get her case closed in 2022 while she sought a visa through her husband, a U.S. citizen.\nHer visa was approved, and with just one interview appointment left, Torres felt blindsided when she received a call from her attorney\u2019s office, saying the government wanted to restart deportation proceedings against her.\n\u201cI just felt my heart sink and I started crying,\u201d she said. Her attorney submitted a motion opposing the recalendaring of the case, and they are waiting to hear how a judge will rule. In the meantime, she said, she\u2019s hopeful she\u2019ll have her final interview for her approved visa before then.\nMariela Caravetta, an immigration attorney in Van Nuys, said that, since early June, about 30 of her clients have been targeted with government motions to reopen their cases.\nBy law, she has to reply in 10 days. That means she has to track down the client, who may have moved out of state.\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad faith doing it like that,\u201d said Caravetta, who accused the federal government of flooding the immigration courts in an effort to meet its deportation quotas.\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t getting due process,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very unfair to the client because these cases have been sleeping for 10 years.\u201d\nCaravetta has convinced some judges to deny the government motions because the clients are seeking ways to legally stay in the country. In a handful of cases, she hasn\u2019t been able to reach her clients.\nThe government isn\u2019t making an effort to reach out to attorneys to discuss the cases, as is required, she added. \u201cThat would save a lot of time for everybody,\u201d she said. Her clients may have U-visas, which give relief to migrants who have been victims of crime and who help investigators or prosecutors. But the government\u2019s motions say, \u201cThese people have not done anything to legalize their status, we need a final resolution.\u201d\nMatt O\u2019Brien, a former federal immigration judge and deputy executive director of FAIR, which advocates for stricter immigration laws, said the Trump administration is \u201cenforcing the Immigration and Nationality Act the way that Congress wrote it.\u201d\nHe questioned why attorneys are complaining about cases being recalendared, saying \u201cit\u2019s akin to a motion of reopening a case in any other court.\u201d\nYet for many immigrants whose cases are being revived, the risks are high. Judges have discretion to deny motions to reopen cases, and have done so in some situations, attorneys say. But judges have also approved the government\u2019s request if there is no opposition from the immigrant or their attorney.\nAt that point, cases are put on the calendar. If it gets scheduled, and the immigrants do not show up to court, they could eventually be ruled \u201cin absentia,\u201d which would make them vulnerable to immediate deportation and bar them from entering the country legally for years.\nIt all fits with the Trump administration\u2019s goal of increasing deportation numbers, say many immigration lawyers and former officials.\n\u201cThey are getting the largest pool possible of people that they can remove, and removing them from the country,\u201d said Jason Hauser, the former chief of staff of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \u201cAnd what stands in the way from that is a working due process of an immigration system.\u201d\nIn April, Sirce E. Owen, acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, issued a memo criticizing the use of administrative closure, referring to it as \u201ca de facto amnesty program with benefits\u201d because it offers work authorization and deportation protections. Owen, a former immigration judge, rescinded previous Biden administration guidance that offered a more proactive approach to administrative closures.\nOwen stated that, as of April, about 379,000 cases were still administratively closed in immigration court and cited them as a contributing factor to the court system\u2019s backlog of 4 million cases.\nIn immigration courts in Los Angeles and San Diego, attorneys are already seeing these cases come before immigration judges. Many clients have expressed shock and despair at being dragged back into court.\nSherman Oaks attorney Edgardo Quintanilla has seen about 40 cases recently, including some dating back to the 2010s. Clients, he said, are alarmed not only by the government\u2019s legal maneuvers but by the prospect of entering a federal building these days.\n\u201cThere is always the fear that they may be arrested when they go to the court,\u201d he said. \u201cWith everything going on, it is a reasonable fear.\u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\nLast Saturday, at the 2025 edition of HARD Summer \u2014 the annual EDM takeover of Hollywood Park in Inglewood \u2014 gritty reggaeton rhythms infiltrated the festival\u2019s usual bass-bumping fare. At the center of the main stage was Colombian superstar Feid, who united ravers and perreo fanatics alike in a glorious twerk fest.\nDistinguished by his signature green apparel, the 32-year-old singer, songwriter and MC has become one of the top 10 most-streamed artists globally on Spotify. Having recently graced festivals like the Governors Ball in New York and Lollapalooza in Paris, Feid, who is also known affectionately by his fans as Ferxxo (pronounced Fercho), continued to break new ground as HARD Summer\u2019s first-ever Latin headliner.\n\u201cThese types of moments will always be very special for Latino culture and for reggaeton, the genre that I sing,\u201d he said, seated across from me in the living room of a posh Airbnb in Beverly Hills. Through the glass doors behind him, I could see his parents wading in the swimming pool. \u201cTo represent the large Latino community in this country, in a lineup that also includes Kaytranada and Busta Rhymes, makes me feel very special. To perform on the main stage and bring that kind of visibility to this festival is amazing.\u201d\nAlthough Feid\u2019s rise to the top feels recent, it\u2019s actually over 10 years in the making. Born Salom\u00f3n Villada Hoyos in Medell\u00edn, Colombia, he started out as a songwriter in his hometown\u2019s reggaeton scene. Feid helped put J Balvin and Medell\u00edn on the map as a co-writer of 2015 breakthrough smash \u201cGinza,\u201d which opened the doors for other Colombian stars like Maluma and Karol G.\nWhile a majority of his peers were feeding from reggaeton\u2019s roots in Puerto Rico, he decided to bring his paisa, or Medell\u00edn-born slang and style to breed a more personal brand of perreo. Following the release of his 2020 album \u201cFerxxo (Vol 1: M.O.R),\u201d Feid made \u201cmor,\u201d which is a Colombian term of endearment for \u201clove,\u201d enter the global lexicon. Soon after, he established himself as a unique and refreshing force in reggaeton with 2022\u2019s blockbuster LP \u201cFeliz Cumplea\u00f1os Ferxxo Te Pirateamos El \u00c1lbum.\u201d\n\u201cI feel that incorporating my culture in everything makes people curious about what these words mean and how to use them,\u201d Feid added. \u201cTo show where you\u2019re from, your roots, and how you grew up through your music makes me feel muy chimba [very cool]. I feel proud to scream from the rooftops that I\u2019m a paisa and I\u2019m Colombian.\u201d\nLatin Grammys 2025 predictions: Bad Bunny, Natalia Lafourcade and Rauw Alejandro among the frontrunners\nWith the voting period now open, De Los assistant editor Suzy Exposito and contributing writer Ernesto Lechner discuss their predictions.\nLast November, he won his first Latin Grammy for his 2023 collaboration \u201cPerro Negro\u201d with Bad Bunny and later received his first Grammy nod in 2025 for his 2023 EP \u201cFerxxocalipsis.\u201d In June, Feid released the experimental \u201cFerxxo Vol X: Sagrado,\u201d which he produced and mixed himself. He\u2019s also been riding high with his girlfriend, Karol G, and their song of the summer, \u201cVerano Rosa,\u201d from her new \u201cTropicoqueta\u201d album.\nThose tracks were included in his hour-long set at HARD Summer last Saturday, along with hits like the playful \u201cFeliz Cumplea\u00f1os Ferxxo\u201d and the ATL Jacob-assisted \u201cLuna.\u201d Feid also flaunted his past hip-hop and R&B collaborations with DJ Premier, Blxst, Majid Jordan and Ty Dolla $ign \u2014 but he got his biggest rap co-sign when a blazed Snoop Dogg emerged as a surprise guest and performed \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot.\u201d\nDe Los caught up with Feid the day before this momentous show to talk about his latest album and upcoming projects in both music and Marvel comics. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nHow would you describe this latest chapter in your music career?\nI\u2019m in an era [when] I\u2019m doing what I like to do and what I enjoy the most. There [are] moments when I like to do something without necessarily thinking about if everyone will like it. There\u2019s also moments where you have to concentrate on winning over the masses. There will be more music for them, but this latest album is something special for the people that have believed in my project since the beginning.\nWhat was it like to independently produce your latest album, \u201cFerxxo Vol X: Sagrado\u201d?\nIt was very frustrating at first. I almost threw in the towel a few times. I talked with my family and friends and I told them: \u201cI don\u2019t like what I\u2019m doing. I don\u2019t think it sounds good.\u201d Then came a moment when I switched things up, I found my footing and everything came out great. To put out this album made me feel like I\u2019m showing everyone as I am; there\u2019s no makeup. There\u2019s no corrections from other producers, or corrections to my voice. There\u2019s no A&R. It\u2019s like if I uploaded a picture of myself in underwear to Instagram.\nIn the past few years, there were beats that I hadn\u2019t finished making and music that I could\u2019ve mixed, but I didn\u2019t. I made this album to prove to myself that I could finish what I hadn\u2019t before. That was my goal for this year. It makes me feel happy that with this album, there were no rules.\nIn November, you won your first Latin Grammy award for best reggaeton performance for \u201cPerro Negro\u201d with Bad Bunny. What was going through your head at that moment?\nThat was crazy! When I didn\u2019t win for \u201cLuna,\u201d I was like, \u201cHijuepucha [son of a ...], if I didn\u2019t win for \u2018Luna,\u2019 how are we going to win for \u2018Perro Negro\u2019?\u201d The songs and artists in that category were all great. To win, it took me by surprise. I\u2019m very grateful to Bad Bunny for giving me the opportunity to share that song with him. I messaged him right away saying that I felt very happy that I won my first Grammy with him. I\u2019ve been nominated and performing at the Latin Grammys since 2019, so to win was amazing. I was very nervous during my acceptance speech. I have a piece of paper from two years ago with what I would say if I won a Grammy. I didn\u2019t say anything that was on that paper. [Laughs]. That moment was muy chimba.\nThis is definitely the summer of \u201cVerano Rosa.\u201d How did that song come together with Karol G?\nWe recorded the song in 2023, but we changed the tone of it many times. We were trying to find a way in which Karol would sound like Karol and I would sound like Ferxxo. In the tone we had it at, I was singing super low and she was at a higher register. I was taking singing classes and that raised my register a bit.\nKarol then told me, \u201cLet\u2019s put this song on my album. It would be muy chimba to release because our teams love us together on it.\u201d So we went to the studio again and recorded it in different tones until we both felt comfortable with it. It\u2019s always special to work with her. She knows what she wants and how she wants it. For her to also be my partner, it\u2019s beautiful and a blessing to work with family.\nWhat did you think when Karol G did your signature \u201cwhoa\u201d ad-lib in the song?\n\u00a1S\u00faper chimba! It\u2019s very funny because I sang her verses and she sang mine. The verses that I wrote for the song are the ones that she sings, and vice versa. She already had my \u201cwhoa\u201d down. It sounded very beautiful. I\u2019m proud of that voice Karol has. She\u2019s been with me through all my processes, I\u2019ve been with her through all her processes. I feel very fortunate that she\u2019s my partner, my colleague and my friend.\nYou\u2019ve also recently been spotted in the studio with The Kid Laroi and Cypress Hill. What can you tell us about those sessions?\nI\u2019m continuing to expand my sound. I\u2019ve worked with reggaeton in a lot of ways. Now it\u2019s like: What can I do to share my sound with Kid Laroi, who is a pop and R&B star, and make it reggaeton? With the legendary Cypress Hill, how can I live within their world of rap and hip-hop? When I collaborate with artists from other genres, it\u2019s a learning opportunity for me. With Cypress Hill, it was all about hearing what they had to say. I showed them the rap songs on my album and asked for their opinions. Those projects should be coming soon.\nYou\u2019ve recently teased a new song called \u201cSe Lo Juro.\u201d Will that song lead to another album?\n\u201cSe Lo Juro\u201d is a very beautiful song. It will be part of my next project. I have everything almost ready to go, [but] I don\u2019t think it will be my usual December drop because that\u2019s far away. I can\u2019t wait until then. [Laughs.] I\u2019m very focused on connecting with the roots of reggaeton and what made me a fan of it.\nYou\u2019re now a part of the Marvel Universe, with the series \u201cThe Green Man.\u201d What can we expect from the second comic later this year?\nIt\u2019s a dream of mine [to be in] the world of Marvel, I\u2019m [one of the] X-Men, and I\u2019ll join them later on. It\u2019s my story inside that universe. The second comic will come out in December, or maybe before. You\u2019re going to keep learning things about my life in a more metaphorical way."

      "text": "Los Angeles\u2019 Azusa Street revival remade democracy once. Its lessons apply today\n- Share via\nWhat if the key to understanding American democracy lies not in marble hallways but in a dusty Los Angeles horse stable, where a one-eyed Black preacher gathered people to pray?\nIn the spring of 1906, William J. Seymour, the son of formerly enslaved parents, launched a revival on Azusa Street in downtown Los Angeles. That converted livery stable became the birthplace of modern Pentecostalism and one of the most racially integrated religious gatherings in American history. Seymour preached a message on divine healing and sanctification to a crowd of Black, white, Asian and Latino worshippers that defied the logic of segregation. As parishioners fell to their knees in prayer, speaking in tongues, something profound happened: They practiced a kind of democracy that few had ever seen.\nSeparating church from state was a novel approach. It\u2019s worked out well for the U.S. but may be ending.\nThe story of Azusa is just one episode in a much larger, and often overlooked, chapter in American history. Most Americans assume the Constitution will protect our rights and secure our freedoms. But for some, the system has never lived up to its promise. During the early 20th century, thousands of African Americans fled the racial segregation and violence of the Jim Crow South and migrated northward and westward, bringing with them a moral vision shaped by the Black freedom struggle and a belief that although American democracy had failed them, it could be made real. As we face a renewed crisis of democracy today, the new communities they built \u2014 which modeled belonging and critiqued exclusion \u2014 offer a lesson.\nThis democratic vision was not born in California \u2014 it was forged in the crucible of slavery, the broken promises of Reconstruction, and the racialized violence of Jim Crow. And yet, in the face of brutality, many did not fret or cower \u2014 they moved.\nMany understood the Great Migration as a sacred journey, with the biblical story of Exodus as a central narrative. Black Southerners saw themselves as a people delivered from bondage and tasked with building a promised land. They did not wait for America to live up to its ideals. Instead, they reimagined democracy through a lens of faith.\nScholars marvel at Los Angeles\u2019 propensity to create new ways to connect God and self. It was fertile ground for Aimee Semple McPherson.\nNowhere was this more evident than in Los Angeles, where the physical and spiritual landscape offered room to build anew. When Seymour arrived from Texas in 1906, he found a city in flux, with Black migrants, Mexican laborers, white spiritual seekers, Chinese railroad workers, and German and Polish Jews all navigating new lives.\nThe young preacher\u2019s message of spiritual revelation met this moment with radical clarity. Instead of traditional sermons and formal liturgy, Seymour\u2019s Pentecostalism emphasized direct and experiential encounters with the Holy Spirit as described in the Book of Acts . Under his leadership, Azusa Street became a space where rigid hierarchies collapsed, at least for a while. Women could preach. Black pastors baptized white immigrants. Worshippers spoke in Spanish and Yiddish. The Los Angeles Times mocked it as chaos. But Seymour saw it as a divine intervention. What made Azusa powerful was the insistence that spiritual authority did not follow the logics of race, gender or class. Dignity and power could be shared, not hoarded.\nSeymour was not alone; other Black religious leaders in early 20th century Los Angeles embraced a similar vision. The Rev. Prince C. Allen, known for his spectacular revivals and interracial gatherings, spoke of a church that would \u201cgobble all the others,\u201d suggesting that Pentecostalism\u2019s spiritual fire could consume racism at its roots.\nNon-MAGA America seethes at Trump\u2019s lies, bluster and authoritarianism. But neither Biden nor any younger, healthier Democrat directly moves to shut down his appeal at its root \u2014 toxic whiteness.\nThe Rev. J. Gordon McPherson, called the \u201cBlack Billy Sunday,\u201d preached to multiracial crowds across Southern California. \u201cThis is the way it will be on the judgment day,\u201d he declared in the pages of the Los Angeles Times. \u201cThe white millionaire of Pasadena is likely to find himself standing at the bar of God by the side of his colored houseman, and they will be on exactly the same footing. If we do a little of the mixing now, it won\u2019t be so surprising.\u201d In tent meetings, street revivals, and mass baptisms at Echo Park Lake, these leaders turned public space into spiritual commons. They were not politicians. But they were democratic visionaries. Black churches became training grounds for civic life, offering food, shelter and job opportunities. More than that, in a city that treated Black migrants as invisible, these congregations made people feel seen.\nIn the decades that followed, Black churches built upon this work, outpacing other civic institutions by offering women leadership roles, redistributing labor and housing resources and helping Black Angelenos launch businesses at a time when lenders denied them access to capital.\nMembers of L.A.\u2019s People\u2019s Independent Church of Christ, founded by Black migrants in 1915, explicitly referred to their ideology as \u201cdemocratic religion.\u201d The church\u2019s second pastor, the Rev. Clayton D. Russell, helped create the Negro Victory Committee in 1941 to protest racial discrimination in Los Angeles\u2019 defense industry.\n* Pentecostalism, the second-largest segment of Christendom, began in L.A. Long-stalled efforts to memorialize the site are moving forward.\nRussell understood that the struggle for Black freedom was \u2014 and would always be \u2014 bound up with the struggles of other communities of color. The church sent a delegation to the 1943 Mexican American Conference to declare Black Angelenos\u2019 solidarity with the wrongly convicted Mexican American teenagers in the now-infamous 1942 Sleepy Lagoon murder case.\n\u201cWe cannot have Victory abroad without the fullest support from the people at home,\u201d Russell wrote at the time, in the Black newspaper the California Eagle. \u201cWe must stop the persecution of minorities to have a united people.\u201d\nIt\u2019s easy to romanticize migration as a one-time journey. But for African Americans in the early 20th century, migration was an ongoing practice of rebuilding. It required courage but also imagination. To move to Los Angeles was to believe that something different was possible.\nHeritage: Members hope to turn the small L.A. residence where the worldwide growth of the group began 91 years ago into a house of prayer, with a bookstore and interpretive center.\nAlthough they were not immigrants in the traditional sense, many African Americans who left the South for the U.S. West in this period called themselves \u201cemigrants.\u201d That word mattered. It signaled a shift in self-understanding. No longer tethered to the brutal legacy of slavery, they were redefining their relationship to the nation. Charlotta Bass, who arrived in Los Angeles in 1910 and later became editor and owner of the California Eagle, described stepping into the city as entering a \u201cnew country.\u201d That was the scale of their hope.\nAzusa Street did not last forever; eventually, the revival fractured along racial lines. But its legacy endures, as we confront a democracy in distress. We live in a moment when immigrants are demonized, voting rights are being eroded and public trust is fragile. But the lesson of early Black migration is that democracy has always been made and remade by ordinary people, practiced in churches, kitchen conversations, street corners and classrooms. It lives wherever people gather to resist the hierarchies that divide us. If we want to save American democracy, we should heed the lessons of the people who had faith, and courage, to begin again.\nCori Tucker-Price is an assistant professor of religion at UC Santa Barbara and author of a forthcoming history on race and religion in L.A.

The Los Angeles Times editorial staff does not create or edit the content.\nIdeas expressed in the piece\nThe Azusa Street revival of 1906 serves as a powerful model for American democracy, demonstrating how a one-eyed Black preacher named William J. Seymour created one of the most racially integrated religious gatherings in American history in a converted Los Angeles horse stable. The author argues this revival practiced a form of democracy that few had ever witnessed, with Black, white, Asian, and Latino worshippers coming together in defiance of segregation-era logic.\nBlack migration during the early 20th century represented a sacred journey comparable to the biblical Exodus, as African Americans fled Jim Crow violence and brought with them a moral vision that could remake American democracy. Rather than waiting for America to fulfill its promises, these migrants reimagined democracy through faith, understanding their movement as both physical and spiritual liberation from bondage.\nPentecostalism under Seymour\u2019s leadership collapsed traditional hierarchies by emphasizing that spiritual authority transcended race, gender, and class distinctions. The author highlights how women could preach, Black pastors baptized white immigrants, and worshippers spoke in multiple languages, creating spaces where dignity and power were shared rather than hoarded.\nBlack religious leaders like Rev. Prince C. Allen and Rev. J. Gordon McPherson extended this democratic vision beyond Azusa Street, conducting interracial revivals and mass baptisms that transformed public spaces into spiritual commons. These leaders functioned as democratic visionaries who understood that racial integration in worship prefigured the equality that would exist on judgment day.\nBlack churches became crucial training grounds for civic engagement, providing food, shelter, job opportunities, and leadership roles for women while helping launch businesses when traditional lenders denied access to capital. The author points to specific examples like People\u2019s Independent Church of Christ, whose members explicitly called their approach \u201cdemocratic religion\u201d and worked to support other communities of color facing discrimination.\nDifferent views on the topic\nContemporary media outlets heavily criticized the Azusa Street revival, with the Los Angeles Times describing participants as \u201cbreathing strange utterances and mouthing a creed which it would seem no sane mortal could understand\u201d and practicing \u201cthe most fanatical rites\u201d while working themselves \u201cinto a state of mad excitement.\u201d[2] The newspaper further complained that \u201cnight is made hideous in the neighborhood by the howlings of the worshippers who spend hours swaying forth and back in a nerve-racking attitude of prayer and supplication.\u201d[2]\nReligious authorities and Christian theologians criticized the revival participants for \u201cbehaviors considered to be outrageous and unorthodox, especially at the time,\u201d reflecting widespread theological opposition to the movement\u2019s practices and claims.[1] The revival\u2019s emphasis on speaking in tongues and dramatic spiritual manifestations challenged established religious conventions and drew skepticism from mainstream Christian denominations.\nCharles Fox Parham, who had been Seymour\u2019s teacher and mentor in Texas, became one of the revival\u2019s harshest critics, denouncing Azusa Street as \u201cspiritual power prostituted.\u201d[4] As a racist, Parham was particularly \u201cappalled at the mixing of whites and blacks in the church and tried unsuccessfully to wrestle the work away from Seymour,\u201d demonstrating that even within Pentecostal circles, the integrated nature of the revival faced opposition.[4]\nThe revival\u2019s impact proved limited in duration and scope, with historians marking its end between 1908 and 1915, and internal conflicts ultimately undermining its unity.[3][4] The movement suffered from leadership disputes, with \u201ctwo women co-workers absconded with the mission\u2019s mailing list,\u201d preventing Seymour from raising support, and \u201cmost of his remaining congregation fell into an anti-Trinitarian heresy and abandoned him.\u201d[4]\nPentecostals faced widespread \u201cderision and even outright persecution\u201d due to \u201cthe noisiness of Pentecostal meetings, the babble of tongues, and the frequent refusal of adherents to accept medical care,\u201d indicating that their practices were often rejected by broader society.[4] The press regularly \u201cjeered\u201d at the revival, and the movement\u2019s participants encountered significant social resistance to their religious expressions and beliefs.[4]"

Milliken said in a statement Wednesday. Milliken said the the goal of negotiations was for all \u201csuspended and at-risk federal funding restored to the university as soon as possible.\u201d\nParts of federal civil rights law, Title VI and Title VII, prohibit discrimination based upon race, sex and national origin or shared ancestry, including Jewish and Israeli identity.\nMilliken, who assumed the top UC post on Friday, struck a firm tone in his message.\n\u201cThese cuts do nothing to address antisemitism,\u201d Milliken wrote. \u201cMoreover, the extensive work that UCLA and the entire University of California have taken to combat antisemitism has apparently been ignored. The announced cuts would be a death knell for innovative work that saves lives, grows our economy, and fortifies our national security. It is in our country\u2019s best interest that funding be restored.\u201d\nThe grant suspensions affecting research into areas including neuroscience, clean energy and cancer, came after the Justice Department and U.S. Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi said on July 28 that UCLA would pay a \u201cheavy price\u201d for acting with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to the civil rights of Jewish and Israeli students who complained of antisemitic incidents since Oct. 7, 2023. The date marks when Hamas attacked Israel, which led to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. In spring 2024, pro-Palestinian demonstrators erected an encampment on Royce Quad and demanded that UC divest from weapons and technology companies with ties to the war.\nThe DOJ issued a notice to UCLA and a warning of a pending lawsuit, saying the campus violated Jewish student civil rights last year during a pro-Palestinian encampment. The same day, UCLA said it would pay $6.45 million in a suit over the encampment brought by Jewish students.\nThe Justice Department had given UCLA until Aug. 5 to indicate whether it would negotiate over those findings. Otherwise, a letter to UC said the Trump administration would sue by Sept. 2. That letter was sent just two days before the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy began notifying UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk that vast parts of the university\u2019s research enterprise must come to a halt.\nIn total, at least 800 grants were frozen.\nThe Times first reported the decision to negotiate with the federal government on Tuesday, citing UC sources who were not authorized to speak publicly.\nIn addition to accusing UCLA of violating the rights of Jewish students, the Trump administration has alleged the campus illegally used race in admissions and let transgender players compete on sports teams that match their gender identity.\nThe allegations are similar to those lobbed against Harvard, Brown, Columbia and other Ivy League universities. Brown and Columbia recently came to sweeping deals with the federal government to restore hundreds of millions in federal research funding.\nIn Brown\u2019s case, the university will also pay $50 million to the state to be used toward workforce development programs. Columbia said it would pay more than $200 million to the federal government. Both schools also agreed to other conditions, including sharing data on admissions with the Trump administration.\nOn Wednesday, Milliken made no mention of a financial payout from UC or other potential terms of an agreement with Trump.\nPresident Trump\u2019s higher education battle comes to the University of California. After the Department of Justice found that UCLA had violated Jewish students\u2019 civil rights, the administration froze hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to UCLA science and medical research.\nExperts say any payment would be a political liability for the university and state leaders in deep-blue California, where Trump\u2019s policies are highly unpopular. Depending on the cost, a payout could also be a financial burden for a university system that is already facing a hiring freeze, budget squeezes, deferred state funding and scattered layoffs.\nIn a campus letter Wednesday, Frenk, who has challenged the idea that grant cuts are an appropriate response to allegations of antisemitism, said the suspensions, if they last, would be \u201cdevastating for UCLA and for Americans across the nation.\u201d\nThe cuts amount to a \u201closs for Americans across the nation whose work, health and future depend on our groundbreaking research and scholarship,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are doing everything we can to protect the interests of faculty, students and staff \u2014 and to defend our values and principles. The UC Board of Regents and the UC Office of the President are providing counsel as we actively evaluate our best course of action.\u201d"

Gavin Newsom calls the \u201clabyrinth of manual verification,\u201d which involves Medi-Cal recipients proving every six months that they are working, going to school or volunteering at least 80 hours per month.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be much harder to stay insured,\u201d said Martha Santana-Chin, the head of L.A. Care Health Plan, a publicly operated health plan that serves about 2.3 million Medi-Cal patients in Los Angeles County.\nShe said that as many as 1 million people, or about 20% to 40% of its members, could lose their coverage.\nThe work requirement will be the first imposed nationwide in the six-decade history of Medicaid, the program that provides free and subsidized health insurance to disabled and low-income Americans.\nIt\u2019s relatively uncharted territory, and it\u2019s not yet clear how the rules will shake out for the 5.1 million people in California who will be required to prove that they are working in order to qualify for Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid.\nAfter the 2026 midterm elections, millions of healthy adults will be required to prove every six months that they meet the work requirement in order to qualify for Medicaid. The new mandate spells out some exceptions, including for people who are pregnant, in addiction treatment or caring for children under age 14.\nDemocrats have long argued that work requirements generally lead to eligible people l osing their health insurance due to bureaucratic hurdles. Republicans say that a work requirement will encourage healthy people to get jobs and preserve Medicaid for those who truly need it.\n\u201cIf you clean that up and shore it up, you save a lot of money,\u201d said House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana. \u201cAnd you return the dignity of work to young men who need to be out working instead of playing video games all day.\u201d\nOnly three U.S. states have tried to implement work requirements for Medicaid recipients: New Hampshire, Arkansas and Georgia. One study found that in the first three months of the Arkansas program, more than 18,000 people lost health coverage.\nPeople can lose coverage a variety of ways, said Joan Alker, a Georgetown University professor who studies Medicaid. Some people hear that the rules have changed and assume they are no longer eligible. Others struggle to prove their eligibility because their income fluctuates, they are paid in cash or their jobs don\u2019t keep good payroll records. Some have problems with the technology or forms, she said, and others don\u2019t appeal their rejections.\nOf the 15 million people on Medi-Cal in California, about one-third will be required to prove they are working, the state said. Those people earn very little: less than $21,000 for a single person and less than $43,000 for a household of four.\nThe state\u2019s estimate of 3.4 million people losing coverage is a projection based on what happened in Arkansas and New Hampshire.\nBut those programs were brief, overturned by the courts and weren\u2019t \u201ca coordinated effort among the states to figure out what the best practices are,\u201d said Ryan Long, the director of congressional relations at the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative think tank that has become influential among congressional Republicans.\nLong said advancements in technology and a national emphasis on work requirements should make work verification less of a barrier. The budget bill includes $200 million in grants for states to update their systems to prepare, he said.\nArguments from liberal groups that people will lose healthcare are a \u201cstraw man argument,\u201d Long said: \u201cThey know that the public supports work requirements for these benefits, so they can\u2019t come out and say, \u2018We don\u2019t support them.\u2019\u201d\nA poll by the health research group KFF found this year that 62% of American adults support tying Medicaid eligibility to work requirements.\nThe poll also found that support for the policy drops to less than 1 in 3 people when respondents hear \u201cthat most people on Medicaid are already working and many would risk losing coverage because of the burden of proving eligibility through paperwork.\u201d\nIn June, Newsom warned that some Californians could be forced to fill out 36 pages of paperwork to keep their insurance, showing reporters an image of a stack of forms with teal and gold accents that he described as \u201can actual PDF example of the paperwork that people will have to submit to for their eligibility checks.\u201d\nMany Californians already are required to fill out that 36-page form or its online equivalent to enroll in Medi-Cal and Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance marketplace.\nExperts say it\u2019s too soon to say what system will be used for people to prove their work eligibility, because federal guidance won\u2019t be finalized for months.\nNewsom\u2019s office directed questions to the Department of Health Care Services, which runs Medi-Cal. A spokesperson there said officials are \u201cstill reviewing the full operational impacts\u201d of the work requirements.\n\u201cThe idea that you are going to get a paper submission every six months, I\u2019m not sure people have to do that,\u201d Long said.\nGeorgia is the only state that has implemented a lasting work requirement for Medicaid. Two years ago, the state made healthcare available to people who were working at least 80 hours per month and earned less than the federal poverty limit (about $15,000 for one person or $31,200 for a household of four).\nMore than 100,000 people have applied for coverage since the program\u2019s launch in July of 2023. As of June of this year, more than 8,000 people were enrolled, according to the state\u2019s most recent data.\nThe Medicaid program has cost more than $100 million so far, and of that, $26 million was spent on health benefits and more than $20 million was allocated to marketing contracts, KFF Health News reported. Democrats in Georgia have sought an investigation into the program.\nThe Inland Empire agency that provides Medi-Cal coverage for about 1.5 million people in San Bernardino and Riverside counties estimated that 150,000 members could lose their insurance as a result of work requirements.\nJarrod McNaughton, the chief executive of the Inland Empire Health Plan, said that California\u2019s 58 counties, which administer Medi-Cal, \u201cwill be the ones at the precipice of piecing this together\u201d but haven\u2019t yet received guidance on how the eligibility process will be set up or what information people will have to provide.\nWill it be done online? Will recipients be required to fill out a piece of paper that needs to be mailed in or dropped off? \u201cWe don\u2019t really know the process yet, because all of this is so new,\u201d Naughton said.\nIn the meantime, he said, the health plan\u2019s foundation is working to make this \u201cas least burdensome as possible,\u201d working to improve community outreach and connect people who receive Medi-Cal insurance to volunteer opportunities."

      "text": "\u2018Vulture\u2019 is a provocative satire about a clueless scoop seeker in Gaza\n- Share via\nBook Review\nVulture\nBy Phoebe Greenwood\nEuropa Editions: 256 pages, $27\nIf you buy books linked on our site, The Times may earn a commission from Bookshop.org, whose fees support independent bookstores.\n\u201cDoctor Strangelove,\u201d \u201cCatch-22,\u201d and \u201cM*A*S*H\u201d collide in British journalist Phoebe Greenwood\u2019s blistering debut novel, \u201cVulture,\u201d a darkly comic, searing satire grounded in historic politics, suffused with incipient journalism and imbued with self-aggrandizement.\nDominoes fall quickly and hard for 33-year-old budding reporter Sara Byrne, assigned as a freelance stringer by the fictional London Tribune to cover the 2012 Gaza War. She is ambitious and clueless. A nepo baby, she\u2019s certain a scoop will make her career and bring her out of the shadow of her recently deceased father, Bill, a foreign affairs writer considered a titan among the giants of Fleet Street. She finds herself ensconced in all-expenses-paid headquarters for foreign correspondents like her: the Beach, Gaza\u2019s four-star \u201cnice hotel,\u201d an \u201coasis of humanity in a blighted desert\u201d featuring a room with uninterrupted sea views and shrimps in a clay pot. Observing the consequences of conflict, Sara soon realizes she is embedded in her own emotional war zone.\nThe Beach is a convenient location for mingling, networking and seeking contacts through a fixer, someone essential for foreign correspondents. Sara\u2019s fixer is Nasser. He introduces her to an aged, grieving Palestinian widower who has lost his whole family in a bombing, but she doesn\u2019t see any point in even being in Gaza if the only story \u201cwas sad Mohammeds talking about their dead kids and dead wives and neighbors and so forth.\u201d\nShe dismisses ongoing attacks, thinking everything is \u201cgetting a bit samey.\u201d A morgue visit elicits disinterest and little more than a body count, with Sara wondering if \u201cten makes a massacre. I only counted six.\u201d In a crowd of dead, limp bodies, she spots a sobbing Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist and exclaims, \u201cWhat good is a crying photographer to anyone?\u201d Heartless, she wants a bigger story, something that would put her byline on the front page. If Nasser can\u2019t get her into Hamas\u2019 underground tunnels \u201cwhere all the men running the war were hiding with their rockets,\u201d then she would have to find someone who could.\nThat someone appears to be Fadi, part of the fixer culture. He wore \u201cskin-tight black jeans and a black t-shirt with I Heart Brooklyn written on it in red, loopy letters\u201d and \u201cstank of aftershave that could easily have been his sister\u2019s perfume and smoked cigarettes greedily.\u201d His alluring credentials include an uncle he claims is a top fighter in the resistance who can get Sara a meet and greet with the leader of the Al-Yasser Front. Fadi promises a photo shoot with black balaclavas, guns and black flags. Foolhardily, defying Nasser\u2019s caution, Sara offers Fadi $1,000 for an excursion into the \u201cterror tunnels,\u201d certain this will give her a proper story to write rather than what she terms \u201cmonkey journalism.\u201d Instead, after several delays and setbacks, she finds herself involved in an excruciatingly senseless death when the Beach\u2019s restaurant is bombed.\nGreenwood\u2019s graphic details are vivid and disturbing, from screaming that is \u201ca high unnatural wail that could shrivel souls like salted slugs\u201d to air \u201cpowdered with concrete and sulfur.\u201d With dead bodies scattered around her, Sara, her hands dripping a trail of blood, retreats to her room, feeling responsible for one particularly shocking death.\nA series of flashbacks sprinkled throughout the novel highlight the deep psychological wounds Sara brings to her wartime experience. They underscore the guilt she carries from traumatic relationships with her father, mother and an adulterous affair. She believes she can never match her father\u2019s success as a reporter and on the first anniversary of his death, instead of visiting his grave, her mother takes her to a Sloane Square department store (because that\u2019s where she was taken as a child to buy shoes). Her clandestine involvement with her father\u2019s close friend and literary agent, whose wife is dying of cancer, implodes, leaving her a bitter \u201cother woman\u201d living her own soap opera. It complicates a sexual encounter with an Italian cohort in Gaza.\nAmerica\u2019s wars are scattered with the brave, rabid and opportunistic.\nOne of those flashback chapters, \u201cThe Cradle of Civilization,\u201d unravels the ironic, ravaging narcissistic, perhaps psychopathic implications of the title. Like the bird of prey seeking carrion, a foreign correspondent is characterized as a misery merchant or conflict cowboy, making a living from death and disaster. Even as their function is to give voice to the voiceless, Greenwood writes, their assignment is to \u201cstand in the middle of something,\u201d to understand (from the Old English, understanden) and listen. As they do so, like Sara, seeking a \u201cdefining moment\u201d they might morph into news cannibals.\nAnd then there are the other birds. They are scattered throughout the novel. Keep an eye on them. Sara does. The literal ones and the magical, metaphorical ones. The first sighting is a simple one, easily dismissed. A manky bird on her balcony jolts Sara from semi-wakefulness right after she\u2019s had a dream of her dying father. Its habitual appearance becomes disconcerting. Is it just a bird or is it a harbinger of doom and death? She begins to think of it as a \u201cderanged stalker,\u201d a \u201chorrifying, tapping shitting bird,\u201d terrorizing her. Eventually, Sara, her health deteriorating from what appears as an undiagnosed illness, begins to hallucinate, seeing the bird\u2019s \u201cheart beating visibly under its feathered ribs, its metallic purple face,\u201d culminating in believing the bird has transmogrified into a talking pigeon that is her father.\nStarring Jeffrey Wright as a frustrated academic and novelist who decides to secretly play the game and write a \u201cBlack book,\u201d it\u2019s a welcome dose of smarts.\nGreenwood\u2019s stinging, salient novel remains relevant (the more things change, the more they stay the same), excoriating those who make a business of war whether it\u2019s public or personal. As the owner of the Beach observes: \u201cWar may be hell but it\u2019s one hell of an employer.\u201d \u201cVulture\u201d is a provocative, uncompromising powerhouse of a read.\nPapinchak, a former university English professor, is an award-winning book critic in the Los Angeles area."

      "text": "Why are America\u2019s most powerful institutions capitulating to Trump?\n- Share via\nLike ancient oaks uprooted by tornadoes, some of America\u2019s richest and most powerful institutions have been capitulating to Donald Trump. Law firms, universities, even Supreme Court justices have surrendered to Trump\u2019s most outlandish demands that they cede their governing principles to him and pay financial tribute that runs into hundreds of millions of dollars.\nThe rationale for some of Trump\u2019s policies\u2014social and economic\u2014are mysterious. But a greater mystery is why these institutions have given in, sometimes without a whisper of defiance.\nThe capitulation trend has encompassed some American institutions that made their names standing firm against authoritarianism. One is CBS, whose parent, Paramount Global, last month settled a $20-billion Trump lawsuit over the editing of an interview with Kamala Harris at \u201c60 Minutes\u201d by paying $16 million, ostensibly to finance Trump\u2019s presidential library.\nA nation of sheep will beget a government of wolves.\n\u2014 Edward R. Murrow, former CBS News icon\nThe settlement \u201cresembled payment of an extortion-like penalty to the government for the standard editing\u201d of the Harris interview, Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for Leadership Studies and a leading professor at the Yale School of Management, wrote in The New Republic with two Yale colleagues.\nAs my colleague Meg James reported, critics blasted the settlement, with one calling it a \u201cspineless capitulation\u201d that would only embolden politicians and others to \u201cweaponize lawsuits and bring regulatory pressure to bear to silence and censor independent journalism.\u201d\nShortly after the settlement, as it happens, CBS announced the cancellation of Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cLate Show,\u201d silencing a widely-followed Trump critic (at least on broadcast TV). The network attributed its decision to economic factors, but it\u2019s been commonly seen as related to the settlement with Trump.\nSonnenfeld ably placed the settlement in the context of CBS\u2019s distinguished journalistic history, which he traced back to the work of Edward R. Murrow in the 1930s and later; under Murrow, he noted, the news division of CBS became \u201cthe gold standard of broadcast journalism.\u201d\nIn settling what many legal commentators regarded as a frivolous lawsuit, Sonnenfeld wrote, Paramount\u2019s goal appeared to be securing the government\u2019s approval of its then-pending $8-billion merger with Skydance Media.\nThe merger promptly received approval from the Federal Communications Commission and closed on Aug. 7, completing what Sonnenfeld called a \u201csellout of the Columbia Broadcasting System\u2019s journalistic values to commercial interests.\u201d\nMany of the other deals with Trump similarly subordinate the institutions\u2019 moral or ethical values to commercial or financial concerns.\nTrump administration immigration and travel policies could have severe negative effects on L.A. events such as the World Cup and Olympics.\nI asked Paramount for a response to Sonnenfeld\u2019s commentary, and received a statement that \u201ccompanies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable costs of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial or reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause.\nCBS is far from alone. Indeed, in the media sphere it was preceded by the Walt Disney Company, which in December settled Trump\u2019s lawsuit over ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos\u2019 on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. In fact, Trump had been found liable for sexually assaulting and defaming Carroll, not for rape. The settlement involved a $15-million contribution for Trump\u2019s presidential library.\nLeading universities have surrendered to Trump accusations of antisemitism and gender discrimination. Columbia (from which I hold a graduate degree) agreed last month to pay $221 million to \u201cresolve\u201d government allegations that it has violated federal anti-discrimination laws. Brown University also reached an agreement with the White House last month to pay $50 million toward workforce development programs in its home state, Rhode Island.\nTrump has recently turned his crosshairs on UCLA, freezing more than $300 million in research grants on the ostensible grounds that the university has failed to \u201cpromote a research environment free of antisemitism.\u201d UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk has responded that \u201cthis far-reaching penalty of defunding life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination.\u201d\nAt least nine leading national law firms have also capitulated to Trump attacks by agreeing to payments totaling $940 million, according to a compilation by Axios, including pro-bono legal representation for conservative entities and other commitments.\nThese settlements often involve non-financial commitments. Some institutions under Trumpian fire agree to end programs promoting workforce, student and faculty diversity, equality and inclusion, or \u201cDEI,\u201d to cite the common conservative shibboleth, or to eliminate other forms of outreach. In effect, they\u2019re ceding control over their academic structures to the White House.\nHiltzik: Stephen Miller says Americans will live better lives without immigrants. He\u2019s blowing smoke\nWill mass deportations make wait times at the ER get shorter and schools have more money? The truth is just the opposite\nInstitutions that have fought back have often been able to block administration threats in federal trial and appellate courts. That\u2019s been true for four law firms that have challenged Trump. Harvard, the target of a concentrated attack by Trump, has won a temporary restraining order against the administration\u2019s effort to prevent the university from enrolling foreign students. A separate lawsuit over Trump\u2019s threat to freeze scientific and other academic grants to the university and its affiliates is pending.\nThe surrendering institutions typically have cited the economic consequences of opposition. Trump\u2019s threat to withhold research funding, which can run to billions of dollars a year, has rattled universities. In explaining Columbia\u2019s nine-figure payoff to the administration, Acting President Claire Shipman stated that most of the $400 million in federal research grants that Trump canceled in March will be reinstated, \u201cand Columbia\u2019s access to billions of dollars in current and future grants will be restored.\u201d The university said the settlement would close \u201ca period of sustained federal scrutiny and institutional uncertainty.\u201d\nAt the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison\u2014the first law firm to reach a deal with Trump\u2014Chairman Brad Karp said the deal was made to reverse Trump\u2019s executive order cutting its lawyers off from government contracts, revoking their security clearances and prohibiting them from entering government buildings or dealing with federal employees. That all amounted to \u201can existential crisis\u201d for the firm, Karp told his partners and associates.\nIt\u2019s possible, though never stated outright, that the surrendering institutions recognize that the clock is running on Trump\u2019s authority. His presidency runs only until Jan. 19, 2029. (Never mind his musings about a third term, which would be unconstitutional. On the Gonna Happen scale, that\u2019s a Not.) They may simply be buying time in the expectation that a succeeding president will reverse the strictures he has imposed. In the meantime, courts may quash his threatened punishments as illegal or unconstitutional infringements of 1st Amendment rights.\n\u201cAppeasement may well be a viable strategy when the party being appeased is willing to take the win and stand down,\u201d writes Steve Vladeck of Georgetown law school. But it\u2019s \u201ca potentially catastrophic approach\u201d that can end up enabling, even encouraging, more bad behavior.\nColumbia, for example, thought that by acceding to Trump\u2019s demands in March to discipline students involved in a pro-Palestinian protest and placing its Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department under \u201cacademic receivership\u201d and appointing an outside chair to run the unit for five years, won it a restoration of research funding. This proved to be untrue, leading to its $221-million settlement in July.\nTrump\u2019s proposed 50% cut in NASA\u2019s science budget would turn the agency into an empty shell. Who\u2019s behind this?\nEven while mounting a legal fight against Trump, Harvard has shuttered its diversity offices, which served minority and LGBTQ students and women, in July\u2014steps that resembled demands from the Trump administration as part of an offer to restore potentially billions of dollars in research funding. But those actions haven\u2019t appeared to quell Trump\u2019s attacks on the university. The university has said that it \u201cremains committed to cultivating a community where all of its members can thrive.\u201d\nThe truth is that Trump can do a lot of damage to institutional interests while he remains in office and legal challenges wend their way through the federal judicial system on their way to possible consideration by the Supreme Court. Even if the High Court ultimately finds Trump\u2019s actions to be illegal, the process takes time and money, neither of which the plaintiffs will recover.\nAs Trump\u2019s public standing begins to erode, new signs of resistance are emerging among his likely targets. Within the Big Ten conference, faculty senates at 14 of the 18 member schools have passed what amount to mutual aid commitments, aimed at coordinating \u201ca unified and vigorous response\u201d to political attacks, in the words of the model resolution developed at Rutgers.\n(The other 17 schools are the universities of Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin; Indiana University; Michigan State, Ohio State and Penn State; Purdue; Northwestern; UCLA; and USC.) The faculties at Purdue, UCLA and USC haven\u2019t yet signed up, but dozens of other schools have inked so-called mutual academic defense compacts.\nOne can only wonder if the trend toward capitulation to Trump\u2019s bare-knuckled threats will have lasting consequences for the rule of law, social norms and the reputations of the submissive institutions. Some law firms that made deals with Trump to protect their business interests have lost clients that came to doubt that they would stand up forthrightly for the clients\u2019 interests.\nSonnenfeld alluded to the possible aftermath in his brief against Paramount/CBS, which he described as a \u201ctragic capitulation of First Amendment rights, accompanied by a demoralizing and brand-tarnishing political appeasement.\u201d He closed his essay with a fitting quote attributed to Murrow: \u201cA nation of sheep will beget a government of wolves.\u201d\nMore to Read\nInsights\nL.A.

The Los Angeles Times editorial staff does not create or edit the content.\nIdeas expressed in the piece\nAmerica\u2019s most powerful institutions, including CBS, Columbia University, Brown University, and major law firms, are abandoning their core principles by capitulating to Trump\u2019s demands and paying hundreds of millions in settlements. The article characterizes this as resembling \u201cpayment of an extortion-like penalty\u201d rather than legitimate legal resolution.\nThese settlements represent a fundamental betrayal of institutional values, with CBS\u2019s $16 million payment particularly egregious given the network\u2019s distinguished history under Edward R. Murrow, when it served as \u201cthe gold standard of broadcast journalism\u201d. The settlement coincided with the cancellation of Stephen Colbert\u2019s show, silencing a prominent Trump critic.\nThe capitulation strategy is fundamentally flawed and counterproductive, as institutions that initially tried appeasement, like Columbia University, discovered that giving in to demands did not provide lasting protection. Columbia\u2019s March concessions failed to restore research funding, ultimately requiring a $221 million settlement in July.\nInstitutions that have fought back through the courts have achieved better outcomes, with Harvard winning a temporary restraining order and four law firms successfully challenging Trump\u2019s threats. This demonstrates that legal resistance can be more effective than submission.\nThe trend toward capitulation sets dangerous precedents that will embolden further attacks on institutional independence and academic freedom, ultimately weakening the rule of law and democratic norms. As one critic noted, the settlements will make it \u201cpolitically harder for the next university to fight back\u201d[1].\nDifferent views on the topic\nInstitutions justify their settlements as prudent business decisions to avoid the substantial costs and unpredictable risks of prolonged legal battles. Companies settle litigation to prevent \u201csignificant financial or reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause\u201d.\nUniversity administrators argue that settlements serve their institutions\u2019 broader mission by restoring critical funding streams. Columbia\u2019s Acting President Claire Shipman emphasized that most of the $400 million in canceled federal research grants would be reinstated, ensuring \u201cColumbia\u2019s access to billions of dollars in current and future grants will be restored\u201d.\nLaw firm leaders describe their settlements as responses to existential threats to their operations. Paul, Weiss chairman Brad Karp characterized Trump\u2019s executive order cutting off government contracts and revoking security clearances as creating \u201can existential crisis\u201d for the firm that required immediate resolution.\nSome institutions may be pursuing a strategic waiting game, recognizing that Trump\u2019s presidency has finite duration ending January 19, 2029. They may be \u201cbuying time in the expectation that a succeeding president will reverse the strictures he has imposed\u201d while courts potentially overturn Trump\u2019s actions as unconstitutional.\nLegal experts suggest appeasement could be viable under certain circumstances. Georgetown law professor Steve Vladeck notes that \u201cappeasement may well be a viable strategy when the party being appeased is willing to take the win and stand down,\u201d though he acknowledges it carries significant risks."

If Newsom has his way, voters in November would face some version of an if/then question: \u201cIf Texas cheats on their voting maps, then (and only then) should California cheat on ours?\u201d\nIn these days of creeping authoritarianism, it\u2019s a fair query, but also one rife with personal interests and risks large enough to remake American democracy, or even inadvertently crush it.\nBut such is the state of our union that even those determined to preserve it are ready to throw out its basic tenets \u2014 myself included, sort of \u2014 and cause a national kerfuffle by considering remaking voting maps to supposedly benefit, if not a party, democracy as a whole.\n\u201cThis is something that we have just never seen before, right?\u201d Mindy Romero told me Tuesday. She\u2019s an assistant professor and the founder of the Center for Inclusive Democracy at USC\u2019s Sol Price School of Public Policy.\nRomero is against gerrymandering, but also agrees that we are in \u201cunprecedented times,\u201d a phrase that doesn\u2019t seem to do justice to the daily trampling of democratic safeguards by our president.\nMost of you are aware by now that the Texas Legislature, allegedly after pressure from President Trump, is contemplating redrawing its voting maps in the hopes of scooping up more seats for Republicans in Congress during the 2026 midterms \u2014 the very election that Democrats are praying will deliver them control of at least one chamber.\nCalifornia\u2019s governor wants to redraw congressional lines to offset a Texas gerrymander. Is that snubbing voters who took the power from politicians? Or necessarily fighting fire with fire?\nWith the possibility that this Texas two-step could hand Trump an even more solidly compliant Congress, Newsom has come up with a plan to gerrymander our own maps. But to make it (hopefully) legal, he needs voters to go along with it because this ain\u2019t Texas, and we don\u2019t ignore rules. We bend them.\nWhoever thought redistricting could be this exciting? But stay calm, redistricting nerds: It remains boring to the majority of voters, which is both the problem and the brilliance of the plan \u2014 you have to engage voters, but also not so much that they think too deeply.\nThe difference between Texas and California is our ballot initiative process, which would ultimately make voters responsible for any gerrymandering here. In Texas, it\u2019s backroom stuff.\nBut will voters go for it? For many, it will come down to simple choices that miss the complexity of what is being asked: California vs. Texas, Newsom vs. Trump, democracy vs. authoritarianism.\nRomero warns that once you smash a norm, even for a virtuous reason, it\u2019s hard to get it back. She worries that despite Newsom\u2019s claim that the rigged maps would disappear in 2030, the gerrymandering might remain.\nCalifornia has one of the best systems in the country right now for nonpartisan redistricting, with an independent commission that draws lines without regard to party.\nIt was put in place because decades of gerrymandering left voters disenchanted.\nIn the 1980s, political icon Phillip Burton allegedly wrangled an infamous gerrymander that still shows just how bad things could be. He did it in part to protect the seat of his brother, John Burton ( a colorful fellow who served in both the state Legislature and Congress before becoming chair of the California Democratic Party) creating a district that wound around the Bay Area in a nonsensical fashion to scrape up the necessary votes.\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d Phillip Burton described that questionable territory to the Washington Post at the time. \u201cIt curls in and out like a snake.\u201d\nThat was just the way business was done before our redistricting commission was put in place in 2008, with a hefty push by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who remains a vocal critic of gerrymandering and who has vowed to fight Newsom\u2019s plan.\nGov. Gavin Newsom said Monday he plans to put new district lines in front of voters in a special election on Nov. 4, but only if Texas moves forward with its redistricting plans.\nBut that nonpartisan system was hard won, and in reality, neither party really loved the idea.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through this and in cooler times,\u201d Romero pointed out. \u201cThe Democrats and the Republicans in California did not want independent redistricting. Let\u2019s make that clear. But a lot of people came together and worked towards this.\u201d\nSo while any upcoming ballot measure will likely focus on the righteousness of fighting fire with fire, it\u2019s also true that the Democratic party and some Democratic politicians would hope to reap personal gain from such a vote.\nAs much as this might be about saving democracy, politics is always about personal and party gain. Some California state legislators would surely desire to win a newly drawn seat in Congress. And, of course, there are Newsom\u2019s political ambitions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to disentangle people that may be sincerely scared for our democracy\u201d from those \u201cthat may be jumping on this, seeing it as a political opportunity. And I think we have to be really honest about that,\u201d Romero said.\nThat\u2019s the choice that voters will ultimately be asked to make.\nBut we also can\u2019t ignore the precarious nature of the times, and the reality that our checks and balances are disintegrating. Do we save election integrity and maybe risk democracy, or try to save democracy and risk election integrity?\nTwo paths lead into the dark. Do voters follow Newsom or Trump?\nMore to Read\nInsights\nL.A. Times Insights delivers AI-generated analysis on Voices content to offer all points of view.

The Los Angeles Times editorial staff does not create or edit the content.\nIdeas expressed in the piece\nThe author presents Newsom\u2019s threat as a defensive response to unprecedented authoritarian times, describing it as a \u201cfair query\u201d given the \u201cdaily trampling of democratic safeguards\u201d by the current president. The piece frames this as California voters potentially being asked to \u201cfix the Texas menace via the ballot box\u201d through an if/then proposition about fighting gerrymandering with gerrymandering.\nThe article emphasizes the distinction between California\u2019s transparent ballot initiative process versus Texas\u2019s \u201cbackroom stuff,\u201d suggesting that California\u2019s approach would make voters directly responsible for any gerrymandering decisions rather than leaving it to politicians alone. This democratic accountability is positioned as a key differentiator that could legitimize the retaliatory action.\nThe author acknowledges the precarious nature of current political times and suggests that traditional democratic norms may need to be bent to preserve democracy itself, presenting this as a choice between \u201csaving election integrity and maybe risking democracy, or trying to save democracy and risking election integrity.\u201d\nThe piece frames the ultimate decision as a binary choice for voters between following Newsom or Trump, characterizing it as democracy versus authoritarianism, with the implication that extraordinary circumstances may justify extraordinary responses to protect democratic institutions.\nDifferent views on the topic\nCalifornia Republican Party Chairwoman Corrin Rankin argues that Newsom\u2019s actions could threaten Californians\u2019 constitutional rights while setting a dangerous precedent, stating that the redistricting \u201cundermines California\u2019s nationally respected, voter-approved Citizens Redistricting Commission\u201d and creates a precedent where \u201cvoters\u2019 choices can be overruled whenever politicians find it politically convenient\u201d[1].\nCritics emphasize that California currently maintains \u201cone of the best systems in the country right now for nonpartisan redistricting,\u201d with an independent commission established in 2008 that draws lines without regard to party affiliation, representing a hard-won reform that took years to implement and should not be abandoned lightly.\nPolitical experts warn about the irreversible nature of breaking democratic norms, with USC\u2019s Mindy Romero cautioning that \u201conce you smash a norm, even for a virtuous reason, it\u2019s hard to get it back\u201d and expressing concern that despite promises the gerrymandered maps would disappear in 2030, the practice might become permanent.\nCongressional Representative Kevin Kiley has responded by proposing federal legislation to prevent early redistricting nationwide and protect independent commissions like California\u2019s, suggesting that the solution should be systemic reform rather than retaliatory gerrymandering[2]. This approach would address the root problem without compromising California\u2019s existing nonpartisan redistricting framework."

      "text": "Hundreds of deaths may be linked to the Eaton and Palisades fires, new study suggests\n- Share via\nBy all accounts, the January firestorms that decimated thousands of homes and killed 31 people in Los Angeles County were the most devastating in the region\u2019s history.\nBut new research argues that the Eaton and Palisades fires may have been far more deadly than what\u2019s reflected in coroner reports.\nA research letter published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. estimates the county experienced 440 more deaths than typically expected between Jan. 5 and Feb. 1 \u2014 a period that began just days before the fires exploded. This higher number of deaths, the study notes, likely reflect such health damaging influences as increased exposure to poor air quality, or delays and interruptions in health services caused by the fires.\nWhile the immediate effects of wildfire and other climate-driven disasters are starkly apparent in hard-hit communities, the lingering consequences can be challenging to quantify. Toxic smoke exposure and environmental damage stemming from wildfires can linger months, and even years, after the flames are extinguished.\n- Share via\n\u201cAttributing deaths properly to a wildfire is just almost an impossible task,\u201d said Andrew Stokes, an associate professor at Boston University and a mortality demographer who co-authored the research letter. \u201cThe research highlights the need for these types of modeling efforts to really get at the true burden of these disasters.\u201d\nTo generate their findings, study authors compared recorded deaths in Los Angeles County from Jan. 5 to Feb. 1 to those tallied during the same period in 2018, 2019 and 2024. (They excluded the years 2020 through 2023 when fatalities were significantly higher due to COVID.)\nAccording to their models, 6,371 deaths were recorded during the nearly monthlong period during the fires compared to 5,931 deaths that were expected based on data from past years.\nVehicle locator data obtained by The Times show that most L.A. County fire trucks didn\u2019t shift into west Altadena until long after fire ravaged the area. How much of the town could have been saved, residents wonder?\nOfficial death counts often rely on easily identifiable causes, including burns and smoke inhalation. But those numbers sometimes fail to capture the complete toll of a natural disaster.\nAccording to the county medical examiner, 19 people died in the Eaton fire and 12 people were killed in the Palisades fire. Many who perished were eventually found among the remnants of their destroyed properties.\nBut the study argues that the actual deaths attributable to the fires were more than 14 times the official count.\n\u201cThe differences are staggering,\u201d Stokes said.\nHeat waves, hurricanes and other disasters have been the subject of similar research, but wildfires can be challenging to study when they erupt in rural, sparsely populated regions. Since the Palisades and Eaton fires occurred in \u201cone of the most densely populated areas of the nation, it was possible using national mortality statistics to establish a reliable baseline trend to estimate excess deaths,\u201d Stokes said.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done here would be almost impossible to do for the Camp fire or other other wildfires that occurred in more rural parts of the state or country,\u201d he said.\nAfter The Times found L.A. had failed to abide by a 2019 law requiring analysis of evacuation routes, Councilmember Traci Park filed a motion for compliance.\nStill, Stokes notes that the study isn\u2019t the full picture of the effects. Firefighters and other first responders \u2014 along with residents inside and outside the fire zones \u2014 could face future health issues stemming from exposure to smoke and ash.\nDuring the January blazes, fire-related hospital visits for smoke exposure jumped significantly across Los Angeles County, according to the Department of Public Health. But wildfire smoke can drift hundreds of miles and the specific number of deaths and hospitalizations tied to exposure are often not well-known until months and years after natural disasters.\nA study published last year by the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation found an estimated 55,000 premature deaths in an 11-year span from inhaling fine particulate matter known as PM2.5, or soot, from wildfires.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done here is what we call a rapid assessment of the L.A. wildfire mortality,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cAnd as such, we only focus on the acute period in which the wildfires were burning in Los Angeles. But we hope that there will be further research to evaluate the long tail of these wildfires.\u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\n- After seven months, many survivors of the Eaton and Palisades wildfires whose homes were destroyed feel they have been shortchanged by the Army Corps cleanup.\n- Hundreds of complaints detail sloppy and inconsistent work by federal contractors who were hired to remove debris.\n- Contaminated pool water has been sprayed onto a neighbor\u2019s yard; fire debris has been left behind; and contractors have not consistently adhered to their own cleanup guidelines.\nAfter January\u2019s wildfires reduced thousands of homes in Altadena and Pacific Palisades to heaps of ash and rubble, wildfire survivors hoped federal disaster workers would give them a fresh start on a rebuild-ready lot.\nBut many residents say that has not been the reality.\nMore than 800 complaints were submitted to a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers hotline dedicated to the agency\u2019s debris removal efforts from March to mid-May, according to public records obtained by the Los Angeles Times. About a third of those reviewed by The Times allege that federal crews either didn\u2019t thoroughly remove wildfire debris or failed to follow protocols.\nMany wildfire victims complained that remediation was mostly confined to each building\u2019s footprint, leaving significant portions of their properties untouched.\nIn some cases, property owners criticized contractors hired by the Army Corps for leaving behind debris, including car parts, fire-damaged home foundations, hazardous trees and contaminated pool water.\nIn other instances, they said federal contractors didn\u2019t adhere to their own cleanup guidelines. Among the most notable shortcomings: failing to remove ash-covered soil outside building footprints and not excavating to the depth established by the Army Corps.\n\u201cThere are no formal standards and requirements after a disaster like this.\u201d\n\u2014 Andrew Whelton, Purdue University\nSome issues raised in complaints have been flagged by Army Corps personnel tasked with providing cleanup oversight, according to internal reports obtained by The Times through a public records request.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether or how these issues have been resolved.\n\u201cThere are no formal standards and requirements after a disaster like this, when it comes to environmental safety and cleanup,\u201d said Andrew Whelton, a Purdue University professor who studies natural disasters. \u201cThere are recommendations and guidelines. But that allows people \u2026 to choose not to follow them.\u201d\nRepresentatives for the Army Corps and its primary contractor, Environmental Chemical Corp., said the cleanup had overwhelmingly received positive feedback from wildfire survivors. But, on occasion, officials have ordered crews to return to properties where owners have raised concerns.\nThe remedies varied case by case, said Glenn Sweatt, ECC\u2019s vice president of contracts and compliance. \u201cWe try to resolve issues to the homeowners\u2019 satisfaction within the FEMA and [Army Corps] guidelines.\u201d\nIn six months, federal contractors have cleared more than 9,300 properties in Los Angeles County, making it the fastest wildfire recovery in modern history. Even as elected officials have praised the Army Corps for the rapid pace of work, the grievances submitted by disaster victims have called into question whether federal workers are sacrificing quality for speed.\nThe apparent deficiencies and inconsistencies have heightened fears that debris removal efforts could leave behind soil contamination \u2014 a possibility FEMA and the Army Corps have not acknowledged even as they argue soil testing is not necessary.\nBut, at very least, the complaints demonstrate the considerable amount of work \u2014 and potential costs \u2014 that may lie ahead for property owners after federal disaster authorities complete their mission.\nCleanup came with caveats, confusion\nIn late January, when the federal cleanup started, the plan seemed straightforward: The Army Corps vowed that its contractors would remove toxic ash and wreckage from destroyed homes. They also would extract up to 6 inches of topsoil.\nBut the scope of the work was more limited than many homeowners who signed up for the Army Corps cleanup realized. Outlined in the work plans and contracts, obtained by The Times, were a number of caveats.\nThe cleanup efforts were mostly limited to the \u201cstructural ash footprint,\u201d which typically included a few feet surrounding the burned-down home. A wide range of debris outside that area was deemed ineligible for removal: driveways and sidewalks, patios, pool water and in many cases large portions of lawns and gardens.\nBecause the plans were not made public, many property owners were confused over what workers could haul away and what they couldn\u2019t. What\u2019s more, some federal contractors didn\u2019t seem to fully understand them either, according to internal reports obtained by The Times.\nThe overall uncertainty led to sometimes inconsistent and inadequate execution.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already traumatized. This is adding to the trauma.\u201d\n\u2014 Unidentified homeowner, in a call to the Army Corps complaining about the cleanup process\nOn March 23, a homeowner called the Army Corps debris removal hotline to complain that a contractor told them \u201cpart of their house is outside of the ash footprint.\u201d The contractor had allegedly determined that a 12-by-6 room inside the house was actually a patio, according to the complaint.\nAnother phoned on March 26 to complain that federal workers declined to remove the front steps and arched entryway to his home. \u201cWe\u2019re already traumatized,\u201d the complainant said. \u201cThis is adding to the trauma.\u201d\nOn May 6, a property owner requested a second opinion from the Army Corps after federal contractors refused to remove a hallway that once connected his home to his garage.\nSeveral callers noted that their home foundations hadn\u2019t been removed, including one who discovered fire debris and his home\u2019s foundation buried underneath a layer of soil after the cleanup wrapped up.\nCleanup crews contracted by the Army Corp of Engineers dumped asbestos-tainted wildfire debris in landfills that they shouldn\u2019t have, according to government records.\nLuke Melchior, chief executive of Melchior Construction Co., has seen many of these issues firsthand. His company has been hired to carry out additional debris removal for several property owners who had opted for the Army Corps cleanup.\nMelchior said the quality of work boils down to the experience of workers.\n\u201cYou get different quality of work based on the integrity of the [subcontractor],\u201d Melchior said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no recourse, because you sign a complete liability waiver when you sign up for the Army Corps of Engineers program. So you basically get what you get.\u201d\nECC oversees the many subcontractors and dozens of individual work crews involved. Sweatt denied that ECC contractors refused to take debris considered eligible by FEMA and the Army Corps. He maintained that there have been fewer complaints as the cleanup has progressed, which he credited to better communication and familiarity with the process.\nHowever, because work plans have been revised several times throughout the cleanup, and are now more inclusive of some types of debris, that means early Army Corps-remediated properties may not have been cleaned to the same degree as later ones.\n\u201cWe thought our block would get done at once. It didn\u2019t. It ended up being kind of piecemeal and haphazard.\u201d\n\u2014 Shawna Dawson Beer, resident of Altadena\nThe Eaton fire destroyed nearly every home on the block of Poppyfield Drive in northwest Altadena where Shawna Dawson Beer lived, including her 1925 English Tudor cottage.\nAlthough Dawson Beer and neighbors attempted to sign up for the Army Corps cleanup on the first day, she said, their properties were cleared sporadically over the course of months. By summer, it was apparent that not all homes were cleaned with the same rigor.\n\u201cWe thought our block would get done at once. It didn\u2019t,\u201d Dawson Beer said. \u201cIt ended up being kind of piecemeal and haphazard.\u201d\nPolluted pool water, murky guidelines\nMore than two dozen complaints involved stagnant pool water, which had been sullied by ash and debris.\nMany homeowners wanted the federal contractors to drain their pools, but pool water was initially ineligible for removal, according to Sweatt.\nThe work plan has since changed to instruct federal contractors to drain pool water if it is within the ash footprint \u2014 meaning within a few feet of the house. That has rarely been the case.\nLos Angeles sanitation officials said that soot- and ash-filled pool water cannot be emptied into the storm drain that flows into the ocean because of contamination concerns.\nIn many cases, that left homeowners to figure out how to dispose of contaminated pool water, or hire a professional to take care of it. Months into the cleanup, federal contractors were still struggling to figure out how to handle it.\n\u201cNo one is sure where the water is going,\u201d an Altadena cleanup inspector wrote in an April 18 report. \u201c[The workers] were instructed not to drain the water into the street. ... Additionally, they cannot drain it into the sewer or spray it onto other properties. They need clarification on the proper procedure.\u201d\nOther crews may not have been aware of the restrictions.\nOn April 7, for example, a cleanup crew in Altadena drained \u201ccontaminated pool water\u201d from a destroyed home and sprayed it onto a neighbor\u2019s yard, according to Army Corps records.\nAnother team was told on April 10 they could drain pool water into the street with a proper filter. Two days later, workers on another site drained a different pool using the \u201cwrong filter,\u201d according to Army Corps reports.\nUneven soil removal worries residents\nThe complaints also raise questions as to whether crews are adhering to soil removal guidelines laid out by the Army Corps and ECC.\nAs thousands of homes burned, the ash and soot left the burn scars and communities downwind cloaked in toxic lead, arsenic and other heavy metals.\nAlthough federal officials have consistently stated that workers would remove topsoil from the entire ash footprint, that hasn\u2019t always been the case. Many homeowners say contractors are not abiding by the Army Corps standard, which includes ash-covered soil 3 feet outside of the building footprint.\nOnce the heavy machinery rumbled away and federal disaster workers moved on, Allen Chen, a 49-year-old spine specialist at UCLA Health, was stunned that the rose garden immediately in front of his home was still covered in fire-charred soil and flecks of white ash.\n\u201cYou have the Army Corps send you this email, like, here\u2019s the final sign off,\u201d Chen said. \u201cBut what you don\u2019t realize is that doesn\u2019t mean anything. That just means the Army Corps has wiped their hands clean of what they were gonna do, which is the footprint. But there\u2019s all this other stuff left over that you have to think about.\u201d\nMany other wildfire survivors say the amount of soil removed has been inconsistent from property to property. At least one homeowner complained it appeared no soil had been removed from their property, which an Army Corps representative concurred with, according to records of an April 2 call.\nSeveral other complaints claimed contractors excavated too much soil from their building footprint, leaving impressions that could cost thousands of dollars to be filled with new dirt.\nIndeed, several reports written by Army Corps cleanup oversight personnel noted that crews had over-excavated properties. The Army Corp says these internal reports demonstrate effective supervision. \u201cThey reflect that our [quality assurance] systems are working as intended: identifying issues, tracking them, and taking corrective action as needed throughout the course of the mission,\u201d an Army Corps spokesperson said.\nArmy Corps officials noted that some properties may appear to be over-excavated due to removal of thick building foundations, crawl spaces and basements.\nIn past wildfire cleanups, the amount of soil removed was guided by soil sampling for contaminants. In this case, however, without testing and a measurable cleanup goal, experts had warned California officials that over-excavation was a risk as well.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a contractor making money off of tonnage you remove per property, that works out in your favor,\u201d Whelton said. \u201cThe consequence is that when the property owner tries to rebuild, sometimes the builder will say: You have to bring in soil, we can\u2019t build at this elevation. And that is a cost to the property owner.\u201d\nThe last time the federal government led a fire response in California \u2014 the 2017 North Bay fires \u2014 the Government Accountability Office concluded that over-excavation had lengthened the rebuilding process. That led to the California Office of Emergency Services paying to bring in clean soil to fix some of the properties.\nFinishing the job\nPrivate contractors have stepped in to resolve issues left in the wake of the federal Palisades and Eaton fire cleanups.\nOne debris removal company even advertises in the Palisades with placards that read: \u201cWe\u2019ll remove what [the Army Corps] leaves behind.\u201d\nChen, the Pacific Palisades resident, said he immediately knew there was still work to be done after the Army Corps crew left his property.\nUnder the plans, federal cleanup workers couldn\u2019t scrape ash-covered soil from the front or back yards. And unlike in past wildfires, disaster workers couldn\u2019t conduct soil testing \u2014 on any portion of his property \u2014 to determine whether elevated levels of toxic substances might still be present.\nSo Chen hired OFRS, an environmental remediation company that offers to test soil, remove debris and fully scrape fire-destroyed lots across Pacific Palisades.\nSoil testing revealed that Chen\u2019s front and back yards contained lead levels that exceeded California\u2019s standard for residential properties. On a recent afternoon, OFRS sent a backhoe to scrape away 6 inches of soil from Chen\u2019s yard and remove ash-covered soil from his rose garden.\nThe federal government decided not to test the soil of L.A.\u2019s burn areas for hazardous substances. A Times investigation found high levels of lead and other heavy metals.\nChen was able to use his insurance to pay for the extra work. Private contractors say many homeowners who opted into the Army Corps cleanup don\u2019t realize they may be able to tap into insurance proceeds for additional remediation.\nBut hiring private contractors may not be an option for those without robust insurance coverage or the ability to pay out of pocket.\nDawson Beer, the Altadena resident, said many of her neighbors already are engaged in heated negotiations with their insurance companies over what they will cover.\nAs these fire-hollowed lots are eventually built upon, Dawson Beer said, she fears that some of her neighbors will come to regret accepting a cleanup that not only was incomplete but also could jeopardize their health.\n\u201cSome lots are going to be cleared properly and clean, and others will not be. And, in the future, we\u2019re not going to know what\u2019s what,\u201d Dawson Beer said. \u201cIt\u2019s Russian roulette.\u201d\nTimes assistant data and graphics editor Sean Greene contributed to this report."
