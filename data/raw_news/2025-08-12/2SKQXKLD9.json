  "content": "A 15-minute walk from the White House, Tony and Mike stood on the sidewalk near the spot where a man was killed on Monday, the 100th murder of the year in Washington.\n\nThe shooting broke out just a few hours after President Donald Trump announced a federal takeover of the US capital, which Trump described as overrun by crime -- though official data shows that violence has recently decreased.\n\n\"It's sickening,\" Tony told AFP early Tuesday. \"It's not safe anymore.\"\n\n\"You do need change, you do need help,\" Mike said.\n\nBut Mike added that the city does not need the help Trump is sending in -- \"not National Guards.\"\n\nThe day after Trump's press conference, residents of the area near the city center told stories of drug sales on the street, but were skeptical that federal intervention would make a difference.\n\nTony has always lived in the area and, like the other residents interviewed, did not want to give his last name.\n\nHe described a local street corner as an \"open air market\" with \"all the drugs that you want.\"\n\nAnne, who was holding pruning shears as she weeded, said needles are often discovered in the flowerbed of the church on the corner.\n\nIt was near this spot that Tymark Wells, 33, was shot around 7:00 pm Monday before later dying in hospital, according to a police report that did not mention a motive or suspect.\n\nThe area is the \"wild wild West and it's always been like that,\" said Lauren, who lives in a building nearby.\n\n\"We're so desensitized,\" the 42-year-old added.\n\nWhen Trump announced his DC plan, he said it was \"becoming a situation of complete and total lawlessness.\"\n\nHowever the Department of Justice said in January that violent crime in Washington recently hit its lowest level in 30 years.\n\nBecause of easy access to guns in the United States, the crime number still \"may look differently in America than it does in other parts of the world,\" Brianne Nadeau, a member of DC's overwhelmingly Democratic city council, told AFP.\n\n\"But we have made substantial strides here,\" she said, calling Trump's federal takeover a \"political stunt.\"\n\nThe annual number of homicides in the city peaked at 274 in 2023, before falling to 187 last year. That is still one of the highest per capita homicide rates in the country.\n\nTrump also justified the takeover by citing the number of homeless people in the city.\n\nAce, a 16-year-old walking her dog, said the presence of the homeless contributed to the feeling of insecurity.\n\nSometimes unhoused people would get on top of her parents' car, she said. \"You don't know if they are going to break in.\"\n\nWhile waiting for the National Guard, around 850 federal agents were deployed to Washington on Monday, making 23 arrests, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\n\"This is only the beginning,\" she said.\n\nTerry Cole, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration tasked with leading the federal takeover of the city's police, said patrolling would be ramped up.\n\nFederal agents and police will work \"hand in hand\" during these patrols, Cole added.\n\nThe city's Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has been forced to accommodate the takeover, said this approach is \"the wrong way to do it.\"\n\nFederal agents do not go out on patrol, she said. \"That's not what they're trained to do.\"\n\nTom, who lives near the scene of Monday's shooting, told AFP there were not enough police patrols in the area.\n\nBut he also criticized Trump's \"draconian approach,\" saying it was unlikely to \"yield any good results.\"\n\nAcross the street, a small memorial stood in tribute to a different shooting victim.\n\nA picture of a young Black man has been wrapped around a tree, with flowers arrayed at its base.\n\nTurell Delonte, 30, was shot dead by police at the spot in 2023, after he was suspected of drug trafficking.",

  "summary": "Washington, DC, residents are skeptical of the federal takeover of the US capital by President Donald Trump, who announced it as being overrun by crime, despite recent decreases in violence. The 100th murder of the year in Washington occurred just hours after the announcement of the takeover, with residents expressing concerns about drug sales near the city center. However, they believe that federal intervention will not significantly impact the safety of the city. The Department of Justice reported that violent crime in Washington recently hit its lowest level in 30 years, with annual homicides at 274 in 2023 before falling to 187 last year. Despite this, the city's Democratic Mayor, Muriel Bowser, has criticized the takeover as \"the wrong way to do it.\"",

Local residents expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of federal intervention, citing ongoing drug issues and a sense of insecurity, while city officials noted that violent crime has actually decreased. Critics, including the city's mayor, argue that Trump's approach is misguided and unlikely to yield positive results.",
