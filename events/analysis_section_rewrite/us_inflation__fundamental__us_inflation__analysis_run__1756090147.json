      "feedback": "The draft good-starts the macro-crypto narrative but falls short of a world‑class, multi‑year, first‑principles framework; to upgrade, recast as a formal regime model with invariant anchors and explicit regimes, then tie the causal chain to market pricing. Actionable edits: (1) inject first‑principles anchors and a policy‑reaction frame—define a long‑horizon regime based on real rate differentials, 2% inflation target with flexible average targeting (Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks and the Fed’s five‑year review), and structural capital flows (BoP/cross‑border liquidity) as the invariant; translate these into a monetary regime function that drives asset discount rates and risk premia. (2) specify regimes and transition conditions with timing: Regime A—restrictive/late‑cycle, policy rate 4.25–4.5%, gradual easing signals; Regime B—unambiguous easing with clear rate cuts; Regime C—structural crypto‑adoption phase (ETFs/staking yields/corporate treasuries, GENIUS Act/Project Crypto progress). State explicit transition triggers (inflation trajectory, payrolls pulse, policy guidance at the Sept. FOMC meeting; SEC/GENIUS/Project Crypto developments) and three nested transmission channels: (i) macro pricing channel (discount rate and term premia linked to rate path); (ii) crypto‑flow channel (ETH/Bitcoin ETF inflows, stablecoin growth, corporate treasury demand, and staking economics); (iii) cross‑asset contagion channel (tech/equity risk‑on/risk‑off spillovers). (3) strengthen the transmission logic with numbers from sources: ETH peak near 4,955 and Bitcoin rally to multi‑year highs; Bitmine Immersion’s $45m purchase; ETH ETF inflows totaling about $9.6b into ETH ETFs and roughly $55b cumulative BTC ETF inflows (sources OGK8WLL69 and 6); add GENIUS Act/Project Crypto tailwinds and Powell’s dovish cues as supply‑side catalysts (sources OGK8WLL69, 4, 5). (4) build out scenario structure with base case, bulls, bears, and plausible pivots, and clearly state invalidation points (hawkish Fed surprise, regulatory clampdown, or a deteriorating macro regime) tied to the UBI/AI‑dislocation risk discussion (NL5YYTLF2) to show alternative pricing paths. (5) tighten the coherence by pruning loosely linked items (Ford and HelloPrenup pieces) or recasting them as general risk‑management heuristics rather than crypto‑pricing drivers; (6) present a concise watchlist: FOMC communications and rate‑path signals, crypto flows and treasury activity, regulatory updates (GENIUS/Project Crypto), and policy debates on labor identity/UBI to test regime validity. (7) deliver a clean base‑case statement with an explicit discount‑rate/flow‑driven rationale and a short list of triggers/invalidation points; ensure consistent citation density across OGK8WLL69, NL5YYTLF2, 6, 2QRLB974F, 1GVYF2V8O. This will yield a robust, multi‑year, first‑principles‑driven, regime‑aware analysis with tangible catalysts, triggers, and risk guards.",
