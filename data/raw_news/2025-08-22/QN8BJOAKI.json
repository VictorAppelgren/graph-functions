      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nGemini Space needs to fix a Pixel home screen issue we've had for years\nJuly 15, 2025\nThanks to a recent APK teardown, we discovered that Google\u2019s At a Glance feature on Pixel phones is getting a major overhaul. What we know as At a Glance will be rebranded as \u201cGemini Space,\u201d and with that, Google is also adding more contextual cards to the longstanding widget \u2014 including sports scores, birthday reminders, finance updates, and more.\nFrom what we\u2019ve seen, Gemini Space aims to show a lot more contextual info than At a Glance currently does, bringing it more in line with something like Samsung\u2019s Now Brief/Now Bar experiences. Assuming Google can make Gemini Space\u2019s content more helpful and personalized than Now Brief, that\u2019s not a bad pitch.\nHowever, with this being the biggest At a Glance refresh we\u2019ve ever seen, I hope Google also uses this as an opportunity to fix something that\u2019s been a problem for years.\nAre you looking forward to Gemini Space?\nThe main thing I want Gemini Space to fix\nEver since Google added At a Glance to Pixel home screens in 2017 with the Pixel 2, the widget has been extremely rigid by design.\nGoogle has always given us control over what content we want to see in At a Glance, but we\u2019ve never been able to change the widget\u2019s appearance or placement. You can\u2019t move At a Glance to the middle of your phone or place it further down on the home screen. You can\u2019t make the widget larger or smaller, and you certainly can\u2019t get rid of At a Glance if you don\u2019t want to see it. You\u2019re simply stuck with the widget at the top left of your Pixel home screen, and you just have to accept its placement there.\nAlthough there\u2019s currently no indication that Gemini Space will add such customization options, I hope Google is using this big overhaul as an excuse to finally address this. If Google is adding so many new cards and going as far as to rebrand At a Glance to Gemini Space, it suggests that the company sees Gemini Space as a significant evolution of the old At a Glance feature. If that\u2019s the case, why not fix a pain point that Pixel users regularly complain about?\nAlthough its implementation is slightly different, Samsung offers precisely this with Now Brief in One UI 7 and 8. If you want quick access to Now Brief on your home screen, you can add a widget and place it wherever you\u2019d like. If you don\u2019t care about Now Brief, you can remove the widget and largely ignore the feature \u2014 just as it should be.\nI certainly hope Gemini Space\u2019s new cards are good enough that I don\u2019t want to remove/disable it, but the fact remains I should have that option to choose. Further, if I love Gemini Space but want to move it somewhere else on my phone, I should be able to do that, too.\nAs someone who\u2019s long felt like At a Glance is a good idea with a lot of wasted potential, I\u2019m genuinely excited about the prospect of Gemini Space and hope it supercharges At a Glance in a way we haven\u2019t seen before. But just as much, Google needs to open up the customization floodgates it\u2019s kept locked away for far too long.\nIt\u2019s time for Google to ease its restrictions\nLimited home screen customization has been an issue with Google\u2019s Pixel phones since the beginning. Just like how Google hasn\u2019t let you change anything with At a Glance, the same is true of the Google Search bar at the bottom of Pixel home screens.\nThe search bar was a point of discussion last month when Google added a new AI Mode icon, much to my chagrin. However, after years of lacking customization for the search bar, we recently found a new \u201cCustomize Search widget\u201d settings page that includes the option to remove the AI Mode icon \u2014 a good sign that Google is finally starting to ease some of its home screen restrictions.\nLimited home screen customization has been an issue with Google's Pixel phones since the beginning.\nCould we see similar options for Gemini Space whenever it rolls out? The ability to move the widget anywhere on the home screen or remove it altogether? Given how significant an update Gemini Space appears to be, and Google adding new customization tools for the Google Search bar, the pieces are certainly there for it to happen.\nGemini Space has the potential to be one of the best Pixel home screen upgrades we\u2019ve ever seen. And as much as I can\u2019t wait to get my hands on it, I also can\u2019t wait (Google willing) to move Gemini Space wherever I damn well please.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nSamsung's Now Bar and Now Brief are the Google Now experience I've been missing\nJanuary 29, 2025\nI have fond memories of the card-based Google Now service from when it was introduced in 2012. As Google\u2019s original assistant, I thought it would suddenly boost my smartphone to a new level, providing context-aware information when needed. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it did its best to keep me on top of the few things I had to worry about back in high school. And then, in true Google fashion, it was gone.\nBut, as they say, what\u2019s old has become new again. Years after card-based assistants were demoted in favor of voice assistants like Siri and Bixby, they\u2019re back again. Apple was first to the party with its Dynamic Island, but now Samsung has arrived with a brand-new Now Bar of its own. So, with a healthy dose of nostalgia, I decided to try the Now Bar on my Galaxy S25, and I think it\u2019s made me a believer. Here\u2019s why.\nDo you miss the old-school Google Now feed?\nSo, did Samsung copy the Dynamic Island?\nWell, yes \u2014 but also no. In some ways, the Now Bar in One UI 7 feels a lot like Apple\u2019s Dynamic Island because it offers glanceable updates on things you care about, like sports scores, kitchen timers, and the status of a voice recording. Also, tapping on a card in the Now Bar will expand to give you more control over whatever is running without fully opening the app. However, that\u2019s about where the similarities to the Dynamic Island wear off, with the rest of the Now Bar feeling significantly more polished.\nI\u2019d say that the Now Bar feels closer to a take on OnePlus\u2019s Live Alerts than Apple\u2019s Dynamic Island, but it has advantages over that, too. The Now Bar is much easier to reach since it lives at the bottom of your Galaxy\u2019s display when you pull up the lock screen. I don\u2019t feel like I have to stretch my hand to check on the thoroughly mediocre state of Penn State men\u2019s basketball (at least in conference), nor do I have to use my Galaxy S25 Ultra with two hands at all times.\nThe Now Bar is like if Apple's Dynamic Island knew me the way that Google does.\nOutside of that, the Now Bar also feels a bit more responsive than either the Dynamic Island or Live Alerts. For example, I\u2019m not the strictest follower of college basketball outside of March, so I didn\u2019t expect to see the Penn State vs Michigan score displayed at the top of my Galaxy S25 Ultra because I hadn\u2019t even downloaded CBS Sports as part of my setup process yet. However, because the Now Bar pulls its sports directly from Google, it should give me updates on most of the teams I\u2019ve looked up recently, including the ones I follow, like Chelsea FC and the Philadelphia Eagles.\nThe Now Bar can also bring you directions from Google Maps, tracking from Samsung Health, real-time use of Interpreter mode, and the timer support I mentioned above. I haven\u2019t had a chance to try them all, as I\u2019ve only had my Galaxy S25 Ultra for a few hours, but so far, Google Maps has guided me to my last soccer game of the season, and Samsung Health has suggested that I might be a little rusty after a month without cleats on.\nDoes the Now Brief add anything?\nPerhaps the only confusing part about Samsung\u2019s Now Bar is that it comes with another Now-branded feature, the Now Brief. At first, I thought the two might be almost identical, only varying when and how they appear on your Galaxy S25 device, but I\u2019ve quickly realized they\u2019re quite a bit different. The Now Brief is much closer to the At a Glance feature at the top of most Pixel home screens, offering a one-stop shop for weather updates, calendar appointments, and a quick hit of news or recommended Spotify playlists.\nEssentially, I think the Now Brief is meant to work in partnership with the Now Bar, but you won\u2019t need to check it as frequently. It seems like a valuable rundown to glance at in the morning before work, around lunchtime, and in the evening \u2014 you know, the times when you have a couple of extra seconds to check your phone. So far, I\u2019ve been decently impressed with the quick weather report, which offers the hourly temperatures and any severe weather reminders, and the Spotify playlists haven\u2019t been bad, either.\nThat said, the Now Brief is a little fast and loose with the news it recommends. Unlike Google\u2019s Daily Listen, which pulls straight from my Discover feed, my Now Brief seems to pick a national news article, whether I like it or not. So far, it\u2019s been an alarming mix of ICE raiding high schools and backlash to whatever Elon Musk has done in the last few minutes, while I\u2019d probably prefer a mix of my interests. Perhaps the Now Brief needs time to learn my news-reading habits, but that\u2019s the one piece that hasn\u2019t felt very tailored to me just yet.\nJust like Google Now, the Now Bar has room to grow\nOverall, I like Samsung\u2019s one-two combination of the Now Bar and Now Brief. They work together just closely enough without being completely redundant, even if their similar names can be slightly confusing. It\u2019s been easy enough to rely on the Now Bar when I leave my Galaxy S25 Ultra and come back to it, especially as it\u2019s taken over for my OnePlus 13 as a go-to kitchen companion. I\u2019m not worried about running a timer and streaming a Spotify playlist simultaneously, and Samsung\u2019s cards stack far easier than those on the iPhone 16 Pro.\nThat said, the Now Bar isn\u2019t perfect. Although it\u2019s incredibly easy to reach when your phone is locked, the cards shift to the notification shade in the top left corner of your display as soon as you unlock it. They might still be easy to reach if you have a smaller Galaxy S25, but it\u2019s much harder on the Ultra. In fact, the Now Bar cards become even more challenging to reach than those on an iPhone or the OnePlus 13, which isn\u2019t great. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a great solution for this since it\u2019s not like Samsung could use a long press of the gesture button to open the Now Bar because that already controls Circle to Search.\nSamsung's Now Bar is off to a great start, but I could use a few more integrations.\nAlso, there are a few more features that I\u2019m hoping will come to the Now Bar down the road. Although it can remind you that you should leave by a certain time to make it to an appointment, I\u2019d sure like it to pick up support for train tickets or airline boarding passes from my Samsung Wallet. In fact, I\u2019m kind of surprised that the two services don\u2019t work closely together to get you from your front door to your gate.\nAnyway, the things that the Now Bar does, it does incredibly well, and I\u2019m eager to keep exploring them as my Galaxy S25 Ultra relearns my usage habits over the next few weeks. Right now, the Now Bar is limited to devices running One UI 7, so if you want your own chance to try it out, you can grab a new phone down below.\n12GB RAM\n7 years software support\nBig battery\n7 years software support\nVastly improved software\n7 years of support\nThank you for being part of our community.

Based on the handful of clues we could spot, we speculated that it could be Google\u2019s version of Samsung\u2019s Now Bar and Now Brief features. Now, we\u2019ve managed to activate Gemini Space, giving you the first look at what is indeed a Now Bar-inspired upgrade to Pixel\u2019s At a Glance experience.\nAn APK teardown helps predict features that may arrive on a service in the future based on work-in-progress code. However, it is possible that such predicted features may not make it to a public release.\nThanks to the latest Android Canary build, we could activate Gemini Space on a Pixel 9, showing us a sports card and a birthday wish for an upcoming birthday.\nGemini Space cards will also show up on the lock screen. You can see the cards in action when using a large clock and a small clock style in these screenshots:\nThe cards also appear on the Always On Display, as you can see in these photos:\nGemini Space should be able to show Sports, Finance, and the newly spotted Daily Hub cards, but we haven\u2019t gotten Finance and Daily Hub to work just yet. The feature is still a work in progress, and we expect its functionality to grow and mature as it gets closer to public release. Google hasn\u2019t yet announced the feature, so we don\u2019t know when it\u2019s coming either. We\u2019ll keep you updated when we learn more.\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nPixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL debut as Google's most ambitious lineup yet\nAugust 20, 2025\nYear after year, Google has given us good reason to consider its latest Pixel lineup among the best Android phones you can buy. And while the company pushes both its hardware and software to new limits with each subsequent generation, this year, the Pixel 10 series has got to represent one of the biggest, boldest steps forward for the phones yet.\nOnce again, we\u2019ve got four new additions to the Pixel family to check out, with the launch of the Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. We\u2019re giving the new foldable some special attention of its own, but right now, let\u2019s break down exactly what you can expect from the three new traditional models forming this year\u2019s Pixel lineup.\n6.3-inch display\nLoaded with Google AI features\nSatellite SOS\nPowerful AI tools\nBright display\nBest specs and AI features\nGoogle Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL: Release date, price, and availability\n- Google Pixel 10 (128GB): $799 / \u00a3799\n- Google Pixel 10 (256GB): $899 / \u00a3899\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (128GB): $999 / \u00a3999\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (256GB): $1,099 / \u00a3,1,099\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (512GB): $1,219 / \u00a31,219\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (1TB): $1,449 / \u00a31,449\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (256GB): $1,199 / \u00a31,199\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (512GB): $1,319 / \u00a31,319\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (1TB): $1,549 / \u00a31,549\nWe\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting the Pixel 10 series for ages now, and back in July, Google finally set the date for this season\u2019s Made By Google event. Today, with August 20 finally rolling around, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s chance to officially check out the new family, with Google showing them all off at its Brooklyn launch extravaganza.\nWhile this year introduces some important changes for the hardware that make up Google\u2019s Pixel phones, pricing is blessedly remaining consistent with last year\u2019s Pixel 9 devices, starting at just under $800 for the 128GB base model \u2014 and moving up from there.\nPre-orders for the new handsets open up today, so if you like what you see here, you don\u2019t have to waste any time getting the ball rolling on making a Pixel 10 model your next daily driver. For all three of these non-folding Pixels, regular retail availability kicks off next week, on August 28.\nGoogle is once again making its latest Pixel phones available to global audiences, kicking sales of the Pixel 10 series off in all the usual markets, with the addition of Mexico this time around. But this year, there\u2019s an important new distinction to be aware of regarding the hardware coming to the US versus the rest of the world \u2014 more on that in just a moment.\nGoogle Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL: Specs\nGoogle\u2019s definitely not going back to the drawing board with the Pixel 10 phones, and at a glance, it can be quite tricky to tell the new family apart from the last generation. But even with that approach to design remaining consistent, the manufacturer hasn\u2019t been afraid to deliver some impactful changes to the hardware you\u2019ll find within.\nWe\u2019ll be covering some of those more important differences in a little more depth, but here\u2019s your bird\u2019s-eye view at how all this hardware compares across the lineup:\n| Pixel 10 | Pixel 10 Pro | Pixel 10

new phone is imaging performance, raw speed, or excellent power management, you should be able to find something about these Pixel 10 phones to make them worthy of consideration. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the highlights.\nCamera\nSome phones really go all-in on camera hardware, and it\u2019s no surprise to see these models with beefy sensors and crazy periscopic zoom options on our list of best camera phones. But even without really jaw-dropping hardware, we also see Google\u2019s Pixel phones join those right up at the top, year after year, thanks in no small part to Google\u2019s exceptional image-processing prowess.\nMaybe the biggest news this year is the arrival of a telephoto option for the base Pixel 10, getting a 10.8MP camera with a 5x optical zoom. Google tries to sell that for a little more than it is, highlighting \u201cup to 10x optical quality\u201d and capable of even tighter zooms with Super Res processing, but we\u2019d be happy either way.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more. Find out more here.\nWith the Pro models, Google doubles down on that sentiment. Here it pairs a 48MP sensor with that 5x optical zoom, and the company claims this offers the highest-quality zoom you\u2019ll get of any smartphone being sold to US shoppers. Similarly, it\u2019s pushing processing to new heights, with these two boasting Pro Res Zoom up to 100x. That\u2019s optimized for the new Tensor G5 processor, and operates using an advanced diffusion model.\nIn addition to the fancy new zoom capabilities, you can expect some solid improvements to optical stabilization quality and auto-focus speed.\nPerformance\nOK, now we\u2019re getting into it. When your smartphone-obsessed friend advised you to hold off buying that Pixel 9 and wait for the Pixel 10 series, this is likely what they looking forward to: the Tensor G5 chip.\nGoogle\u2019s been building Pixel phones around its custom-designed Tensor processors for years now, but with this generation the company moves from Samsung to TSMC as its manufacturing partner \u2014 and as a consequence, jumps from the 4nm process it employed across the past two chips down to 3nm for the G5.\nGoogle's got more to prove than ever this year, with all eyes on the Tensor G5 and its performance.\nUnsurprisingly, this chip is heavily focused on AI capabilities. It can run on-device models with the help of an upgraded TPU, which Google says is 60% more powerful than before. That new production node doesn\u2019t just help the Tensor G5 run on average 34% faster but also aids in keeping power consumption down. And in case you haven\u2019t picked up on it from those incredible camera tricks we were just touching on, this chip\u2019s got an upgraded image processor on board.\nUnlike last year, we\u2019re not getting any big shake-ups when it comes to memory configuration. Google is sticking with the same 12GB for the base Pixel 10 and 16GB on the Pro and Pro XL. We\u2019d love seeing 16GB across the board, but the lack of motion here isn\u2019t exactly surprising.\nYour storage choices also remain largely consistent with the new Pixel 10 generation, still starting down at 128GB, but this time Google drops the 128GB option for the Pixel 10 Pro XL, starting at 256GB, instead \u2014 honestly, a trend we wouldn\u2019t hate to see trickle down to the rest of the phones.\nScreen quality and size\nGoogle\u2019s also sticking with what works when it comes to screen size and resolution, returning with the same 6.3-inch sizes on the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro, and a 6.8-inch panel on the Pro XL. On the smallest Pixel 10, that spells a pixel density of around 420ppi, while you\u2019ll enjoy a slightly sharper image closer to 490ppi on the Pro models. All three support Smooth Display output at up to 120Hz, but only the Pro models can also dial that down as low as 1Hz for power saving.\nPeak brightness should be about 10% higher this time around, from what Google calls \u201cbest in class\u201d Actua displays \u2014 and better yet, the company claims we\u2019ll get those brighter screens without feeling the impact on battery life. Just like we had with the Pixel 9 series, Google is tapping Corning for some Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection.\nDesign, colors, and build quality\nWhile last year brought us a major new look, with that new pill-shaped camera island on the back, the Pixel 10 is very much a smartphone cast in the physical mold of its predecessor. And comparing the sizes of these three phones against their Pixel 9 equivalents, the differences are absolutely minuscule: Really, the only distinction you\u2019ll measure is the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro each coming in a tenth of a millimeter thicker than last year.\nThere is, admittedly, a little heft being added this time around, but it\u2019s on a scale that might be too minor to notice outside of holding one phone in each hand \u2014 maxing out at an 11g difference with the Pixel 10 Pro XL.\nJust like on the front, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protects the hardware around back, with a sturdy aluminum frame making up the middle of our smartphone sandwich. And as we\u2019d only expect, all three carry an IP68 ingress rating, so they\u2019ll have no trouble surviving a brief dunk.\nWhat's your favorite Pixel 10 series color?\nThe question of best Pixel colors is a contentious one, granted, and this year you\u2019ve got your choice of four no matter which Pixel you go with. In addition to the expected assortment of neutral tones, we get a few fun options, like Indigo and Lemongrass on the smallest Pixel 10 and Jade available for the Pro and Pro XL.\nDepending on where you get your Pixel 10, you may notice a low-key omission from the phone\u2019s expected design. For Pixel 10 series phones sold in the US, this year, Google is taking the unprecedented step of going eSIM-only: The phones will lack a traditional tray for a physical SIM card. While some users might not blink twice at that, those who rely upon the flexibility of physical SIMs (especially when traveling) could run into trouble \u2014 so be advised.\nBattery life and charging speed\nHere\u2019s one area in particular where we\u2019re feeling pretty optimistic this year \u2014 even if that\u2019s one word that\u2019s just positively fraught to throw around when we\u2019re talking all things battery. Instead of making one big change, Google has implemented several, and with any luck, they\u2019ll all add up to make the Pixel 10 series some real endurance champions.\nGoogle started by lowering power demands from phone components, with parts like the 3nm Tensor G5 chip and the updated Actua displays promising to merely sip away at battery capacity. On its own, that might not deliver in the way users hope, but Google pairs that with higher-capacity batteries across the board.\nNow, those gains themselves are a little minor: 270mAh higher on the Pixel 10, 170mAh higher with the 10 Pro, and up 140mAh on the Pro XL. But they are absolutely progressing in the right direction, and we will take all the extra juice phone manufacturers are willing to offer. Maybe most interesting, though, is that this year the little Pixel 10 actually manages to push past the Pro in terms of raw capacity \u2014 even though the phones are the same size, we guess not having a few of those Pro upgrades left room within for some extra battery.\nThat\u2019s consumption and capacity for you, but maybe Google\u2019s biggest win with power on the Pixel 10 series will come from how you recharge them.\nWith this generation, Google is finally giving users a full-featured wireless charging experience, and that means Qi2 support, complete with built-in magnets for secure attachment \u2014 no case required. The company is taking full advantage of this by introducing new Pixelsnap branding for accessories designed to tap into it \u2014 including a long-overdue successor to the Pixel Stand. You\u2019ll enjoy 15W wireless speeds on the Pixel 10 and Pro, while the Pro XL supports even speedier Qi2.2 25W charging.\nWired charging also gets a boost across the lineup, going from 27W to 30W for the Pixel 10 and Pro, while climbing from 37W to 45W on the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Google says that users should expect over 30 hours of battery life, and between all these upgrades, that sounds like it just might be within the realm of possibility.\nSoftware and updates\nUnlike last year, when the Pixel 9 phones arrived still running Android 14, Google has sorted out its development cycle, and Android 16 has arrived well in time to show up at home on the Pixel 10 phones. And with seven years of updates in the pipeline, you\u2019ll be running new Android releases well into the next decade.\nJust like everything Google touches these days, the Pixel 10 series is chock full of Gemini AI-powered features \u2014 including a full year of free access to Google AI Pro with the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL. Gemini Live is picking up some cool-sounding new tricks, like highlighting stuff in your camera to show you, and the Phone app is adding an impressive real-time translation tool.\nWe finally get to meet what would have been Pixel Sense with the introduction of Magic Cue, an AI-powered assistant with awareness of what you\u2019re working on with your phone, and the ability to offer suggested actions you may want to take next. In case that sounds like a step too far, Google\u2019s privacy controls will let you decide just how much of your data you want AI having access to.\nYou\u2019d have to be living in a cave not to understand how popular journaling is these days. Rather than forcing you to jot your thoughts down in something like Keep, Google\u2019s now offering a dedicated solution in the form of the new Pixel Journal app \u2014 complete with PIN protection to keep your private thoughts private.\nThere\u2019s tons more, too, from Call Message offering a hand dealing with your missed calls to Pixel Studio upgrades, new NotebookLM integration with Pixel Recorder and Screenshots, and Camera Coach helping you get your best shots yet. It\u2019s the new Pixel, after all! This is Google\u2019s biggest chance to show off all year! If you don\u2019t want to miss out on that experience, make sure to get your pre-order in now.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."
