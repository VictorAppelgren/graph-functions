  "content": "For the past three generations of the iPhone, Apple has stood alone in a particular area: eSIMs. Apple made a shift that many had anticipated since the first eSIM was launched in 2016, dropping the physical SIM card tray from the iPhone 14.\n\nExcept, this was only in the US, as the company bowed to pressure from carriers to go eSIM-only, and every iPhone since has followed suit just in the US. This is likely to continue with the iPhone 17 series next month, including the iPhone 17 Air, but now Apple won\u2019t be alone as Google has joined the party.\n\nThe new Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL all lack a SIM card tray in the US, but the Pixel 10 Pro Fold still retains it. This split strategy approach, coupled with the pain of activating eSIMs without engaging the carrier or when traveling, further muddies the mess that is eSIMs.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the industry to decide on a standard and stick to it. We either go all-in on eSIMs or return to including a SIM card tray in every phone. The current approach doesn\u2019t work, and it\u2019s up to the big three phone makers to decide which direction to go.\n\nThe current state of eSIMs and physical SIMs\n\nI remember phones with mini SIMs, microSIMs, and the current nanoSIMs used by most SIM cards today. Most phones released since 2015 have used the nanoSIM standard, and while the industry was quick to transition to the nanoSIM standard, it\u2019s been much slower to take the final step.\n\nWhen eSIMs were first introduced, the promise was of a global standard that would make it easy to activate a new SIM card when you land in a new country. Industry alliances promised that it would usher in an era where your SIM card could easily move from phone to phone or you could switch between networks with just a few taps.\n\nIn practice, eSIMs are far more complicated right now. Most major carriers globally support eSIMs, especially as virtually every phone now supports adding an eSIM, but not all carriers support eSIMs for prepaid clients. Some require you to seek further customer service, download apps for activation, or follow other convoluted procedures.\n\nEven if you\u2019re a paying postpaid customer, the process of switching SIM cards can be considerably far from the initial promises. Then there\u2019s the process of transferring eSIMs between phones, with some carriers supporting it and others requiring their intervention or some form of registration. If you\u2019re switching from Android to iOS or vice versa,\n\nIf eSIMs are to be the true future of cellular connectivity \u2014 and as you\u2019ll read below, I hope it does \u2014 then the status quo won\u2019t suffice. Instead, we need to force carriers globally to put their own interests aside to build a global eSIM standard that every carrier can support, so eSIMs can finally live up to their promise.\n\nThe main reason carriers love eSIM-only phones is that it makes adding a second SIM card much harder. This directly increases loyalty and revenue per customer, especially if they keep their smartphones locked for the duration of any device finance agreement, making it challenging to unlock the phone once it\u2019s paid off.\n\nThese customer frustrations are designed to ensure it\u2019s just hard enough to leave the network, whether temporarily while traveling, or permanently in search of pastures new. Yet, some of the core reasons customers may want an eSIM are for travel, and carriers have taken considerable steps to make it less necessary.\n\nFor years, carriers in the US and the UK (where I have extensive experience) made it so costly to travel abroad that seeking a local SIM card for data was the preferred way to travel. Now, the big three carriers all include roaming for free or at a fixed daily rate with a monthly cap, so there\u2019s no bill shock once you return home.\n\nAdd in the frustration of finding a carrier store in a foreign country that supported prepaid eSIMs, and the ability to also make and receive calls on your main phone number, and the ease and safety of traveling with your home SIM card becomes more appealing than jumping through hoops to get around it.\n\nOf course, the ubiquity of eSIMs has made it effortless to add a new SIM card for data (or for calls, texts, and data) when you travel, and apps like Airalo, Holafly, and Sally make it easy to install a new SIM card. Yet, they won\u2019t always work; you have to prepay for data, and you\u2019ll still be charged for any incoming or outgoing calls, texts sent, and data usage on your main SIM card if it\u2019s turned on. The answer is clear: we need one global standard.\n\nWhy I hope eSIMs become the dominant standard\n\nI hate the current state of eSIMs, but I love eSIMs as I often have 4 or 5 eSIM profiles installed on a single phone. I have over 14 active SIM cards from around the world \u2014 yes, I know it\u2019s an obscene amount, and yes, it\u2019s hard to keep track of them all \u2014 and more than half are installed as eSIMs.\n\nHowever, of the nine installed as eSIMs, only four can be easily switched between phones, and only two can easily migrate between iOS and Android, or vice versa. That makes for just 15% that has delivered on the initial promise of eSIMs.\n\nYet, the answer would be simple: make eSIMs the dominant standard and remove all physical SIM cards everywhere. Period. This is a drastic move, but doing so would quickly force global adoption of an eSIM standard that is less about maximizing individual carrier revenue and more about ensuring that carriers can sign up new customers.\n\nOf course, things could stay like they are now, but then eSIMs wouldn\u2019t achieve their promise. In particular, it wouldn\u2019t be straightforward to access eSIMs in any country, and notable holdouts like China would take longer to support the standard. However, China has finally begun issuing eSIM licenses to the country\u2019s phone makers, so it\u2019s slowly moving in the right direction.\n\nAt the same time, if all phones go eSIM only, carriers will have to improve the customer experience. Suppose a specific carrier requires engaging customer service. In that case, the costs of acquiring a customer will be astronomical, and senior management would quickly adopt self-serve solutions rather than see a large increase in overhead expenses.\n\nThe same applies to carriers who don\u2019t support prepaid customers or have certain requirements; any obstacle to eSIM customers will be quickly resolved when eSIMs are the only choice. Perhaps then, eSIMs will be as useful as we were promised they would be.",

      "text": "The iPhone 17 Air is set to become the first iPhone that\u2019s as light as a feather \u2014 or light as air, as its name suggests. Not because it\u2019s as tiny as the oldest iPhone models, but rather it\u2019s because it\u2019s as thin as the MacBook Air that inspired it and thinner than the rest of the iPhone 17 line.\nAlthough the iPhone 17 Air is months away from being officially announced by Apple, let alone the standard iPhone 17, the leaks and rumors swirling around the ultra-slim model have iPhone users excited about the prospect of holding it in their hands and anxious about its fragility because of its thinness. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the iPhone 17 Air.\niPhone 17 Air: design\nLet\u2019s get the obvious out of the way: the iPhone 17 Air is thinner than most smartphones have any right to be, least of all the iPhone. Rumors from early March said that the iPhone 17 Air might be as thin as 5.5mm, but after examining the dummy unit for it, the chassis has been slimmed down enough that it looks to be about 5.1mm thick. Though that\u2019s not the final measurement, it would be as thin as the side of a mirror if it wasn\u2019t covered by a frame.\nFor reference, the standard iPhone 16 is 7.8mm thick, while the iPhone 16 Pro is 8.25mm thick. The iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro look to be about .50mm thicker than that \u2014 8.75mm each \u2014 but those measurements aren\u2019t final, either. Leaked photos also show the iPhone 17 Air having a pill-shaped camera bar just like the Google Pixel 9, with the only difference being that the panel is the same color as the glass shell instead of black. And just like the iPhone 16e, it looks to have only one camera lens.\niPhone 17 Air: battery\nThe iPhone 17 Air being almost paper thin gives the impression that the battery is going to be smaller and therefore the battery life isn\u2019t going to be as sufficient as it is on the other models. However, according to Marc Gurman of Bloomberg, Apple isn\u2019t going to compromise the quality of the battery life, saying that it will be \u201con par with current iPhones\u201d despite carrying a slimmer battery.\nWhile there\u2019s no word on how long the phone\u2019s battery will last, Apple considered making the iPhone 17 Air a \u201cportless\u201d iPhone, but they kept the USB-C port on it after all due to regulations imposed by the European Union. Otherwise, iPhone 17 Air users would have to using either wireless charging or MagSafe charging ports \u2014 both of which are not accessible everywhere, nor are they affordable for some people.\niPhone 17 Air: display\nRumors say that the display for the iPhone 17 Air will be 6.7 inches in length. That\u2019s smack in the middle of the iPhone 16 Pro\u2019s 6.3-inch display and the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s 6.9-inch display. In other words, it\u2019s not too big, but it\u2019s not too small either.\nThe display is said to have an OLED panel and a 120Hz refresh rate, which is pretty smooth for a phone of that size. The display is rumored to have a ProMotion display, which means that feature would no longer be restricted to the Pro models.\niPhone 17 Air: cameras\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to have a single rear camera lens, just like the iPhone 16e. But, as we said before, it may be housed inside a pill-shaped camera bar, which the budget-friendly version of the iPhone 16 doesn\u2019t have. Rumors suggest that the rear camera will be 48 megapixels, while the selfie camera will be 24MP.\nThe 24MP selfie camera would be a big jump from the 12MP cameras currently present on the iPhone 16, as that would improve the quality of photos and videos taken from that angle. Especially if the iPhone 17 Air users happen to be social media influencers. However, the single-lens rear camera may not capture spatial photos or videos.\niPhone 17 Air: pricing\nBarring any tariffs, the iPhone 17 Air may cost around $900. That may not generate a lot of sticker shock, considering the iPhone 16 Plus costs that much."

      "text": "If you\u2019re considering traveling abroad, you\u2019ve probably wondered how to save money on roaming costs. Carriers \u2014 both in the U.S. and abroad \u2014 are notorious for charging a considerable amount of money to use your phone in a foreign country, and this can quickly double, or even triple, your monthly phone bill.\nFor many years, the solution was simple:When traveling abroad, ensure you have an unlocked phone and buy a local SIM card when you arrive. This worked well in theory, and aside from problems with carriers locking handsets \u2014 which still exist now \u2014 it was the best way to travel.\nIn 2021, Apple followed many Android phone makers by launching dual SIM support on the iPhone 13, which offered a lot of promise. Combining the physical SIM card with a secondary software-based embedded SIM was meant to make it easy to travel, or at least make it easy to install a second SIM card on your phone. The following year, Apple went to eSIM only and helped usher in a range of new eSIM providers dedicated to saving costs when you travel.\nOn a recent trip to Bali, Indonesia, and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), I tried three different providers to answer the question: Which one should you roam with? Or should you use your existing carrier? I also had my Google Fi SIM as a point of comparison. Which am I going to use going forward? Let\u2019s find out.\nThe cost of traveling with your U.S. SIM card\nTo understand the benefits of deploying a secondary data SIM for travel, we first need to explore the cost of roaming with the big U.S. carriers in the two popular destinations I traveled to.\nTo standardize this comparison, I priced out the cheapest package for each carrier; given the myriad of packages, plans, and terms, this price may not apply to your existing plan, but it should be the cheapest published option for each carrier. Of course, this information relies on each carrier\u2019s website being up-to-date, so it may not be completely accurate.\nFirst, let\u2019s look at T-Mobile. The magenta carrier makes things reasonably straightforward as long as you\u2019re on the right plan. If your plan includes roaming, you\u2019ll get up to 5GB of high-speed data and then unlimited data limited to up to 256 Kbps. Wi-Fi calls to the U.S., Mexico, and Canada are free, whereas non-Wi-Fi calls are charged at $0.25 per minute.\nT-Mobile also has three international passes if you need more data (or you don\u2019t have included roaming), and all come with unlimited calling back to the U.S.: 1 day with 512MB of data for $5, 10 days with up to 5GB of high-speed data for $35, and 30 days with up to 15GB for $50. For this two-week trip, let\u2019s assume there\u2019s no included roaming, and T-Mobile\u2019s cost comes out to $35 total, albeit with roaming speeds limited to a maximum of LTE.\nNow for Verizon: $12 per day or a monthly plan for $100. This allows you to use your existing plan allowances when traveling, but it\u2019s worth noting that Indonesia is limited to LTE, while Dubai has 5G roaming. The cheapest way to roam on Verizon is for a total cost of $100, the cap for a month of roaming charges.\nAT&T also offers similar packages to Verizon. The International Day Pass allows you to roam for $12 per day, with no extra charges after 10 days per line, per bill. AT&T supports 5G roaming in both Indonesia and the UAE, although it\u2019s dependent on your device being compatible with the 5G bands (n78 in particular) used in those countries. The total cost for AT&T comes to $120.\nThe benefits of travel eSIMs\nIf you search for the best travel eSIM, you\u2019ll find many options with similar pricing and terms. However, look beneath the surface, and you\u2019ll find a few that stand apart from the rest.: Holafly, Nomad, and arguably the most popular, Airalo.\nAll these allow you to add a second SIM to your phone, but unless you pay a premium, these are limited to data roaming only. Each of these SIMs also has a further benefit: it\u2019s easy to sign up via the app and install it on your phone, and when you land at your destination, it should activate automatically. However, it\u2019s worth noting that, unlike your own U.S. SIM, these usually only work in a specific country unless you buy a multi-country regional plan that\u2019s more expensive.\nThe biggest benefit of picking a separate eSIM is the ability to control costs. Instead of charging it to your bill and suffering from sticker shock when you eventually receive your bill, paying upfront allows you to fix your costs. However, the opposite is also true: If you would rather not pay upfront, this makes it easy to defer it to your next phone bill instead. Regardless, here\u2019s how each compares.\nHow much cheaper is Airalo, Holafly, or the Nomad eSIM?\nI spent nine days in Bali and four in the UAE, meaning a total of 13 days. I used almost 10GB In Indonesia \u2014 which proved to be a necessity given the poor hotel Wi-Fi speeds \u2014 and 3GB in Dubai, with an average usage of 1GB per day.\nHere\u2019s a quick summary of the packages included with each of these three providers:\n| Airalo | Holafly | Nomad | |\n| Bali (10GB) | $24.75 | \u2013 | $23.00 |\n| Bali (Unltd) | \u2013 | $36.90 | \u2013 |\n| Max speed in Bali | 5G | LTE | LTE |\n| Dubai (3GB) | $9.50 | \u2013 | $11.00 |\n| Dubai (Unltd) | \u2013 | $12.90 | \u2013 |\n| Max speed in Dubai | LTE | 5G | 5G |\n| Total cost (13 days) | $34.25 | $49.80 | $34.00 |\nAs you can see, most of these plans are significantly cheaper than roaming with your SIM card from the U.S., but this isn\u2019t the entire picture.\nFirst, it\u2019s worth noting that Holafly has a different business model from the others. While Airalo and Nomad both offer a set amount of data that\u2019s valid for a set number of days, Holafly offers unlimited data, but charges you for the number of days that you need it.\nSecond, in Bali, in particular, 5G service is virtually invisible. Although I tried all services on handsets that supported the required bands, 5G coverage was nonexistent. This is included when roaming with Google Fi, which supports the highest roaming speeds in most countries. It\u2019s also worth noting that Airalo and Holafly offer regional and global plans that include multiple countries, and some of these plans include 5G services, while the country-specific plans do not.\nThe one catch with most travel eSIMs\nThere\u2019s one very large catch with most travel eSIMs that you should be aware of: Unlike your physical SIM, most travel eSIMs can only be activated on one phone.\nFor most people, this isn\u2019t a problem, but if you have multiple devices like me, you can\u2019t uninstall and activate it again on a second phone. Also, if you accidentally delete the eSIM, you\u2019ll lose whatever unused data you haven\u2019t used.\nThe exception to this is Holafly, where the nature of paying per day means you can move the eSIM from one phone to another, but it can only be installed and active on a single device at a time. It\u2019s a big improvement over the competition, but ultimately, you are paying for the privilege of doing so.\nThings to consider when picking a travel eSIM\nChoosing an eSIM for travel is quite hard, but I\u2019m fairly impressed with Holafly as a whole. You\u2019re probably looking for the cheapest, fastest, and best in equal measure \u2014 but as the adage goes, you can only have two out of three easily. Considering the overall value for money, Holafly represents a fantastic balance between the three, but there\u2019s also a further catch worth keeping in mind.\nNone of these plans include calling features if you plan to call home using a regular phone call versus a Wi-Fi call using FaceTime Audio or WhatsApp. It\u2019s not that it\u2019ll charge you, but rather, there is no traditional phone number with which you can make or receive calls and texts. If you want a local phone number, you\u2019ll need to buy a local SIM \u2014 which can often be cheaper, but requires visiting a store, etc.\nIf you also plan to travel for an extended period, it may be worth considering roaming with your existing SIM card. Yes, they cost more, but the overall difference diminishes fairly quickly, especially if you travel for close to a month or visit different countries.\nLastly, it\u2019s also worth mentioning that local SIMs can sometimes be cheaper. In Bali, plenty of stores offered data on the same networks as these eSIMs at a slightly higher price, but with the ability to also make calls. In Dubai, it\u2019s also fairly easy to pick up a local SIM. The pricing can be extremely competitive, as you\u2019ll see below, for a combination of minutes and texts to call locally or internationally.\n| 7-day plan | Cost | Data (>3GB) | Calls/Texts | Carrier | Speed |\n| Airalo | $9.50 | 3GB | \u2013 | Etisalat | LTE |\n| Holafly | $29.90 | Unlimited | \u2013 | Etisalat | Unknown |\n| Nomad | $11.00 | 3GB | \u2013 | Du | 5G |\n| Virgin Mobile | $40.84 | 21GB | 30 local/intl | Virgin (Du MVNO) | 5G |\n| Du | $26.96 | 6GB | 30 local/intl | Du | 5G |\n| Etisalat | $21.51 | 4GB | 30 local/intl | Etisalat | 5G |\nOn paper, Nomad offers the best balance between speed and data allowance. While Airalo is the cheapest, you must verify your identity to conform with the UAE\u2019s Know Your Customer (KYC) rules. This is the equivalent of giving the carrier your passport when you sign up at the airport. From personal experience, the UAE is particularly stringent in clamping down on SIM cards that don\u2019t conform to KYC rules.\nThis is the travel eSIM I recommend\nOverall, travel eSIMs are a fantastic option to ensure you have data available as soon as you land, but they come with their own set of limitations, many of which can be pretty confusing. Unlike your phone bill or a SIM card from the local country, there\u2019s no person you can speak to, and there are other limitations that may leave you frustrated.\nI like Airalo\u2019s service for its balance, but the limitation on changing devices is particularly challenging. Nomad\u2019s eSIM service is simple to use and priced very competitively. And in my actual testing, it proved to be the least throttled of all these services. It was also able to pick up 5G services in Dubai, which was slower than local networks, but still fast enough for usable data.\nWhile I wanted to recommend Holafly, the service just doesn\u2019t work. In many countries, it\u2019ll try to route you through servers in Hong Kong, resulting in no data passthrough and a SIM card that doesn\u2019t work. I contacted Holafly\u2019s support via WhatsApp, and while they were knowledgeable, there was no way to get this working.\nIf you want an eSIM that works well in every country and has excellent support, I recommend Airalo, although it may not be the fastest. It\u2019s simple and easy to set up, and aside from a limitation on changing devices, it\u2019s extremely effective. That said, for longer trips, the convenience, calling features, and speeds may mean it\u2019s just easier to roam with your home carrier SIM card."

      "text": "Google has finally released the public build of Android 16, and it is now available to download for compatible Pixel phones and tablets. With this earlier-than-usual update to Android, Google is focusing not on under-the-hood improvements and practical enhancements, but has also introduced a new design language, as well.\nThe previous build, Android 15, focused little on visual upgrades but brought in privacy features, such as partial screen recording and Private Space. Android 16, on the other hand, takes a more holistic approach. If you are curious about the update, here is everything you must know about Android 16 and the new experiences it brings to the table:\nPhones that can download Android 16\nAt the moment, Android 16 is limited to Google\u2019s own Pixel phones, starting with the Pixel 6 and newer. Although the list may expand over the coming weeks, these phones currently support Android 16 if you would like to try:\n- Pixel 6/6 Pro\n- Pixel 6a\n- Pixel 7/7 Pro\n- Pixel 7a\n- Pixel Fold\n- Pixel Tablet\n- Pixel 8/8 Pro\n- Pixel 8a\n- Pixel 9/9 Pro/9 Pro XL\n- Pixel 9 Pro Fold\n- Pixel 9a\nIn the meantime, if you don\u2019t have a Google Pixel phone but still want to get a taste of its key changes, you can join the official beta programs currently in progress at Samsung, Honor, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Vivo, and Xiaomi.\nNotifications with Live updates\nOne of the most insightful features on Android is the support for Live updates from apps that deal with time-sensitive notifications. A prime example is food delivery or cab-hailing apps, which will now show the completeness of your order \u2014 or more simply, the time left to arrival \u2014 through an animated progress bar in a dedicated tile on the top of your notifications and on your lock screen.\nThe progress bar functionality is already present in iOS (as Live Activities) and has also been implemented by several Android OEMs, including OnePlus. You can also see it in action within the Now Bar on Samsung phones. Now, with this change, Google is stepping up to make this a standard functionality in Android, which means it will be available on all devices that run Android 16 and above. Here\u2019s an example from developer Viktor Mykhailiv:\nMeanwhile, developers will get access to APIs that will enable live tracking feeds from their apps to be shown through animated tickers. When not viewed directly, the information will be condensed into small pill-shaped icons on the status bar, displaying only the most important information, such as the time left.\nBesides live tracking of orders from food delivery apps or cab services, Live updates will also display the ETA for a trip in Google Maps when the app itself is minimized. While the actual utility will depend on apps, and many might not support it initially, we can expect big ones like Uber to be onboard soon.\nTo reduce the notification clutter, Google will also club together notifications from the same app within a single banner, as you can see in the image above. \u201cYour notifications will automatically be grouped together to keep things looking tight and organized,\u201d says Google.\nAudio Sharing and hearing device support\nOne of the most notable accessibility-centric upgrades arriving with Android 16 is support for hearing aids in voice calls. Following the update, users can switch the audio routing of their voice to the phone\u2019s superior speaker, instead of the onboard mic on their hearing aid.\nMoreover, core controls for such devices are now natively available within the Android 16 software. Moreover, the per-ear controls for hearing aid devices are now accessible in the same fashion as you would interact with an average audio gear connected to the phone.\nIf there\u2019s one way Bluetooth headphones have not been able to match up to wired ones, even the lowest quality, it\u2019s the ability to split audio into two different headsets. And almost a decade after Apple forced the entire phone industry to give up on headphone jacks, Bluetooth headphones haven\u2019t quite been able to replicate the functionality \u2014 besides on a small set of unpopular smartphones.\nGoogle, however, intends to finally fix this with a feature called Audio Sharing, which will cast the audio from one pair of Bluetooth earbuds or headphones to another. This basically means that while one person can control the audio playback on their phone, others can join through what Google calls an Audio stream.\nThe feature relies on Auracast, an audio broadcasting technology where people can tune in to specific broadcast channels \u2014 much like radio \u2014 through their Bluetooth headphones. The only requirement for Audio Sharing on Android to work is that the headphones must support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) while the phones must support Auracast. As a result, it will work only on Pixel 8 and newer Google devices (but not Pixel 8a).\nFor other Android devices, we will have to wait and see which manufacturers implement support for it. In addition to earphones, people with certain other compatible devices, such as hearing aids, will also be able to join audio streams. But this will come at the cost of reduced audio quality. Interestingly, this feature has been somewhat of a peekaboo asset and has kept appearing and vanishing between the QPR beta builds.\nAdvanced Protection\nAdvanced Protection is the most advanced suite of security and safety features that Android has to offer. It intends to protect users against malware, risky websites, phishing messages, and scam calls.\nWhen this feature is enabled, you can no longer download apps from any other source except the Google Play Store and the pre-installed app stores from smartphone brands. Users will also see warnings if an app has not passed Google\u2019s standard security checks.\nIt also enables Safe Browsing in Chrome. In this mode, websites are automatically risked and flagged for safety, and users are alerted if they are about to download a risky file package from suspicious sources. \u201cAdvanced Protection allows only Google apps and verified third-party apps to access your Google Account data, and only with your permission,\u201d Google assures.\nPredictive back gesture\nA relatively minor, but meaningful quality of life upgrade, in Android 16 is support for predictive back gesture. Essentially, when you hit the back gesture \u2014 either by tapping on the navigation button at the bottom of the screen or using the screen edge gesture \u2014 you will see a preview of the landing screen.\nSimply put, it lets you see a glance preview of the screen where the back gesture is going to take you. All you have to do is extend the tap on the back button or keep the finger swiped inward on the screen without lifting it to see the preview.\nAdaptive refresh rate\nMost smartphones \u2014 at least those running Android \u2014 feature displays with refresh rates beyond 60Hz. But with refresh rates that go up to 120Hz, 144Hz, and sometimes even 165Hz, battery consumption becomes a big issue.\nAnother disadvantage is that not all apps run at the highest rates, which can cause frame tearing or jitters in the interface \u2014 a term that is usually called \u201cjank.\u201d Some high-end Android devices bypass this limitation by using LTPO displays that support variable refresh rates or multiple variable steps.\nFor instance, a high-end model from 2025 would support refresh rate values such as 1Hz, 10Hz, 24Hz, 30Hz, 48Hz, 60Hz, 72Hz, 90Hz, and 120Hz. The display uses a refresh rate that is closest to the content that is being displayed on the screen. That, of course, does not apply to less premium phones, which typically only support fewer values, such as 30Hz, 60Hz, and 120Hz.\nEven with the most expensive devices, the decision of which refresh rate to pick depends on the content played on the screen, which can lead to delay, albeit by a few milliseconds. Secondly, most displays are tuned to run different refresh rates at different display color modes \u2014 based on how they were calibrated.\nTo solve this, Google is looking at PC gaming monitors and adding what it calls Adaptive refresh rate deeper in the Android framework. Although the feature was first introduced in Android 15, it will become mainstream in Android 16. The deeper integration means a display can switch between refresh rates more seamlessly without changing display color modes and allows more apps to take advantage.\nIn addition to reducing jank, adaptive refresh rate should also improve battery life on phones, allowing displays to work at low refresh rates unless necessary.\nHaptics tuned to apps\nOver the years, Android OEMs have advertised iPhone-like crisp haptic feedback and vibrations. Brands like OnePlus have even been able to achieve it with alarms and ringtones on flagship devices.\nBut beyond that, and a handful of games that claim to support \u201c4D vibration,\u201d the topic has largely been ignored. So, with Android 16, Google is adding richer controls for developers to integrate into their apps, where they can assign different vibration patterns to different actions.\nGoogle says the new haptic APIs will allow developers to \u201cdefine the amplitude and frequency curves of a haptic effect\u201d while minimizing the effects of hardware (vibration motor) available on the devices. This should result in better-tuned haptic feedback across a multitude of apps, though the actual adoption lies with developers.\nTablet computing makes a leap\nAndroid 16 marks a new phase for running apps on a larger screen. On tablets, you will finally be able to freely resize and move app windows. And this convenience will unfold not just on the tablet\u2019s screen, but also on a connected external display.\nA new taskbar overflow will now greet users, making it far easier to manage workflows across different app windows. And if your work is tied to Chrome, you will be glad to know that Android 16 adds the ability to run multiple instances of the same app.\nAnother notable feature, one that power users will appreciate, is the incoming support for custom keyboard shortcuts.\nSafety is tied to location\nThe idea behind this feature is to prevent a bad actor from wreaking havoc in events like theft and prevent account takeover in unknown locations. Google says this new safety guardrail in Android 16 will \u201chelp stop common scams like shoulder surfing & PIN theft.\u201d\nOnce enabled, you will be asked to verify your identity using device lock, PIN, or biometrics if you intend to access sensitive information or log in to a service in a new location. In order to access the feature, follow this path: Google > All services > Theft protection > Identity Check.\nYou will be asked to enter your Google account details while setting it up, and you can further enhance the recovery protocols by entering your phone number and verifying it. Identity check will be triggered outside trusted locations if someone tries to access passwords and passkeys, use autofill, change device unlock protocols, attempt a factory reset, enable on-device developer options, or remove a Google account.\nCamera controls\nGoogle is making several under-the-hood changes to camera algorithms in Android, and the benefit may not be limited just to its own Pixel lineup. First, it is bringing Hybrid exposure, which will allow you to specifically illuminate or darken parts of a photo while letting auto-exposure take care of the rest of the frame.\nApps will have control that combines ISO with auto-exposure or exposure time and auto-exposure, allowing greater flexibility on the amount of light in the image. And these features will not just be limited to the Camera app on your phone but also extend to apps such as Instagram and Snapchat.\nSecond, video recording apps will have finer controls over hue and color temperatures separately while recording videos instead of just playing with white balance. This will allow for video recording with more accurate colors.\nThird, Google is also allowing third-party apps such as Instagram and Snapchat to make use of the phones\u2019 built-in night modes for better low-light photos. Lastly, there are improvements to motion photos that will allow HEIC format photos to retain their HDR metadata through UltraHDR support.\nAdvanced Professional Video (APV) recording\nVideo recording on Android 16 is getting yet another boost in the form of added support for APV 422-10 Profile. APV or Advanced Professional Video is a codec that supports 10-bit encoding and video bitrates up to 2 Gbps for \u201cperceptually lossless\u201d video quality while consuming 20% less space than other professional video codecs like HEVC.\nA place to store your health records\nGoogle has opened up support to store your health records and make them readable to other apps. You can store medical records in FHIR format and then make them accessible to other apps using Health Connect \u2014 a system app that lets you share fitness and activity-related data across apps.\nThat means you may receive your digital health records from one app \u2014 say the one your hospital uses \u2014 and share them with another app, such as a diagnostics app or one that may be used to predict cancer.\nAmbient mode for BLE hearing aids\nAndroid 16 brings functionality where volumes of hearing aids with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) will be automatically adjusted based on the ambient noise levels. This means the volume on hearing aids will automatically decrease in loud situations or increase when it\u2019s quiet.\nIn addition, Android 16 will also be able to switch the input source between the microphone on the hearing aids and the phone during voice calls. This will be handy in noisy environments when hearing aids\u2019 microphones may not hear sufficiently.\nDesktop mode\nFor a few generations of Android, Google has been brewing a native Desktop mode or a Chrome OS-like interface that will be projected onto a bigger screen when you connect your phone. Samsung already does this with DeX, but Google wants to make it standard across all phones. Android 16 finally brings it to the table.\nUnfortunately, the built-in desktop mode is not widely available with the stable build. Instead, it is limited to the second beta of the Android 16 QPR 1 update. Also, it is not a fully refined experience and will likely take a few months before it is rolled out widely.\nIn its current iteration, the feature is buried within the Developer Settings section and requires you to enable the \u201cEnable desktop experience features\u201d toggle, followed by a reboot.\n\u201cThe phone and the external display operate independently, and apps are specific to the display on which they\u2019re running,\u201d explains Google. Also, keep in mind that it is limited to the mainline Pixel 8 and Pixel 9 series phones, and not their affordable A-series siblings.\nNew Easter egg\nAmong the major user-facing changes coming to Android 16 is its mightily overhauled Easter egg, a tradition which Android has carried on since the beginning. With Android 16, the spaceship Easter egg that originated in Android 14 reaches a seemingly more fulfilling form.\nMuch like Android 14 and 15, the Easter egg has a small game where you can float around in the space and find other celestial bodies. With Android 16, there are seemingly more celestial bodies to find and even land on. Google has also added an autopilot mode, so you can simply appreciate its efforts rather than cribbing about how awfully baffling the steering controls feel at first.\nWhen you land on a planet, a tiny victory flag is hoisted. And when the spaceship takes off, there\u2019s a blast-off animation where the vessel springs up from the surface where you had previously landed. If you were hoping to score a win, there aren\u2019t any checkpoints \u2014 not the ones we spotted.\nBut unlike any previous generations, you can minimize the Easter egg and jump back into action later by tapping the persistent notification.\nAs mentioned above, this floating notification is meant to exemplify the utility of the Live updates feature we discussed above. It displays your progress en route to your next destination, showing the remaining distance and ETA. However, you will have to start afresh if you swipe the notification away."

      "text": "The Pixel 9 Pro was arguably the phone of the year last year, as Google introduced a vast array of improvements designed to compete with the best phones.\nUpgrades to the display, camera, processor, and battery yielded one of the best phones I\u2019ve ever used, and several welcome improvements in the software meant the Pixel 9 Pro was also the first Google phone to persuade me that Google can make great phones.\nFast forward a year, and Google just announced the new Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL. Instead of the big upgrades that we saw with the Pixel 9 series \u2014 and this year\u2019s base Google Pixel 10 \u2014 Google\u2019s Pro models feature more modest upgrades.\nYet, the Pixel 10 Pro builds on an already-excellent smartphone, so are these modest upgrades enough for it to stake a claim as the best phone of 2025?. Should you buy the Pixel 10 Pro or Pixel 10 Pro XL? I spent half an hour with them at Google\u2019s Pixel 10 launch in New York City today, and it turns out that modest upgrades to an excellent phone can make for an even better all-around phone. Here\u2019s our first look at Google\u2019s new Pro lineup.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL cameras are familiar yet different\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL both feature the same design as last year\u2019s devices, complete with the horizontal camera bar housing a triple camera setup. There are subtle changes to the OIS on the telephoto, but otherwise, the 50MP wide camera, 48MP ultrawide, and 48MP telephoto (offering 5x optical zoom) all match the camera on the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nYet, despite the identical specifications on paper, both phones introduce several new Pixel camera features that set the Pixel 10 Pro series apart from last year\u2019s models.\nFirst, there\u2019s a new Pro Res Zoom as Google uses the first-ever diffusion model and the largest ever model in the Pixel camera to deliver up to 100x zoom. Unlike the dual telephoto cameras on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, the surprising part about Pro Res Zoom is that Google achieves this zoom with just a single telephoto lens.\nThe company says the feature is best used for capturing photos of landscapes or landmarks, but also notes that when a person is spotted in the image, the algorithm applies special tuning to ensure that features appear accurate and life-like and to prevent misrepresentation.\nThen there\u2019s a new certification to help identify and track the source of any images, as well as determine which images were created with AI. The Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL cameras feature C2PA Content Credentials built into the camera itself \u2014 for the first time in a smartphone \u2014 which secures metadata within the image to ensure its entire journey can be documented.\nGoogle already has one of the best smartphone cameras, and the improvements to the Pixel 10 Pro camera, as well as the Pro Res Zoom feature, ensure the Pixel 10 Pro series is likely to pick up that mantle.\nA new era for Pro performance\nOne of the more notable changes in the new Pixel 10 series is the Tensor G5 processor. This is a key moment in Google\u2019s smartphone journey as the company has switched from using Samsung Foundry as its chipmaker to the world\u2019s biggest smartphone chipmaker, TSMC.\nBuilt upon the same 3nm process as rival chipsets like the Apple A18 Pro in the iPhone 16 Pro or the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite in many smartphones \u2014 including the OnePlus 13, Galaxy S25 Edge, and Galaxy Z Fold 7 \u2014 the Tensor G5 brings a significant improvement to the performance of all the Pixel 10 series smartphones.\nIt\u2019s the biggest upgrade since the first Tensor processor launched five years ago and is built for deeper customization and the latest advancements in on-device AI. The Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) \u2014 which is used to accelerate machine learning workloads and improve AI performance \u2014 is 60% more powerful, while the CPU is 34% faster than last year\u2019s Tensor G4. There\u2019s also an upgraded ISP for better photography, and all-around improvements to performance and battery life.\nBig changes to battery life and charging speeds\nThe other area where the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL offer significant improvements is in battery life and charging, but here the Pixel 10 Pro XL has a further advantage over its sibling.\nBoth phones feature larger batteries than last year, but neither is significantly larger. The Pixel 10 Pro has a 4,870 mAh battery \u2014 up from 4,700 mAh in the Pixel 9 Pro \u2014 while the Pixel 10 Pro XL has a 5,200 mAh battery, which is up from a 5,060 mAh battery in the Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nThe biggest improvements come in the form of charging speeds. The Pixel 10 Pro supports 30W charging, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL boosts this considerably to 45W. This means the Pixel 10 Pro should charge to 55% in around 30 minutes, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL will charge to 70% in the same period.\nYet, even this isn\u2019t the biggest improvement: the Pixel 10 series is the first Android phone to support Qi2 magnetic charging out of the box, without needing a separate accessory. Google is calling it PixelSnap, but it\u2019s the same as Qi2, and it means the Pixel 10 series can use the variety of MagSafe charging solutions available for the iPhone. The Pixel 10 Pro will charge at 15W when charging wirelessly, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL supports Qi2.2 and 25W wireless charging.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro series has excellent software again\nOne of the hallmark features of the Pixel 10 Pro series, as with the past nine generations, is Google\u2019s excellent software features. The Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL run Android 16 with Google\u2019s new Material 3 Expressive UI out of the box and come with seven years of software and security updates, meaning they\u2019ll be supported until at least Android 23.\nAlongside the core Android 16 features, the Pixel 10 Pro series also gains some exclusive Gemini features to help it stand out from the competition. Key to the new series is the Magic Cue feature, a new set of helpful and proactive suggestions that leverage the Tensor G5 processor and Google\u2019s Gemini Nano model to enable real-time contextual suggestions. Early use cases include adding events or previewing weather forecasts for upcoming travel, but the possibilities for this feature are vast.\nThen there are the other software additions, including a Daily Hub digest that\u2019s similar to Samsung\u2019s Now Brief, improvements to Call screening, and a big update to voice translation: the Pixel 10 Pro series can translate phone calls in real-time, and the caller on the other end will hear the translation in their language using your voice. Google is known for excellent software, and the Pixel 10 Pro series continues this trend.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro proves small upgrades can make a big difference\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL both prove that small upgrades can make a sizeable difference to the all-around user experience. There are only a handful of updates compared to the Pixel 9 Pro, yet each of these makes the experience noticeably better.\nI only spent half an hour with the Pixel 10 Pro series, but one thing is clear: whether it\u2019s the new Pro Res Zoom feature, Qi2.2 magnetic charging in the Pixel 10 Pro XL, the Tensor G5 processor, or the plethora of Gemini features, these are likely to pick up from the Pixel 9 Pro series as some of the best phones you can buy.\nThere\u2019s one key thing to note, however: this year, Google has followed Apple\u2019s lead, and the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL are both eSIM-only in the US. This means there\u2019s no physical SIM card support, but the wide availability should mean that eSIMs should become easier to activate amongst the carriers.\nPixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL price and availability\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL are both available to pre-order today and will launch on August 28. Both are available in the same Obsidian and Porcelain colors as last year, but also new Moonstone and Jade shades.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro starts at $999 for 128GB of storage, while upgrades to higher storage options will cost a slight premium. The 256GB model costs $1,099, the 512GB model an additional $120, and the top-tier 1TB model costs $1,449.\nMeanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro XL starts at 256GB storage, and is also available with 512GB or 1TB of storage. Each option costs $100 more than the equivalent Pixel 10 Pro option.\nPixel 10 Pro\nPixel 10 Pro XL"

      "text": "A year before the expected launch of the iPhone Fold, the world of folding phones has become fiercely competitive. Oppo first dropped the world\u2019s thinnest folding phone \u2014 the Oppo Find N5 \u2014 earlier this year, but then limited its release to just China and Singapore.\nA few months later, Honor launched the new Magic V5 at the beginning of July, which stole the Find N5\u2019s title, and just a week later, Samsung launched the most impressive folding phone this year, the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Unlike its competitors, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has a key advantage: it\u2019s available in all major markets, including the US.\nAgainst this backdrop, Google just announced the successor to last year\u2019s Pixel 9 Pro Fold at an event earlier today in New York. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold builds upon last year\u2019s excellent folding phone, but it also bucks the trend amongst its peers; rather than going thinner, Google made it thicker.\nI spent half an hour with Google\u2019s new folding phone earlier today, and it\u2019s an iterative upgrade with a few key improvements, but one major drawback. Here\u2019s our first look at Google\u2019s new folding phone.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold has flagship hardware\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold was a welcome improvement over the first-generation Pixel Fold, and saw Google improve every facet of the design in a major overhaul that would have been better placed in this tenth-anniversary version of the Pixel series.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the first folding phone with full IP68 dust and water resistance, which ensures it boasts the same durability as many of the best phones. The hinge has also been improved, and it\u2019s twice as durable as the last generation, with Google also claiming that it can handle over ten years of folding.\nThe front features a 6.4-inch Actua display, which is 0.1 inches larger than the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, with a dynamic refresh rate between 60Hz and 120 Hz, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection, and up to 3000 nits peak brightness. The main display is the same 8-inch display used in the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, although it\u2019s slightly brighter at the same 3,000 nits, and it also supports a max refresh rate of 120Hz alongside Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection.\nThe rear also features the same triple camera setup from last year\u2019s model, with a 48MP wide camera with f/1.7 aperture, a 10.5MP ultrawide camera with f/2.2 aperture, and a 10.8MP telephoto camera with f/3.1 aperture that offers up to 5x optical zoom. The latter two lenses are on par with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 \u2014 albeit with better zoom performance \u2014 but Samsung\u2019s latest folding phone brings the 200MP camera found in the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and it could outperform Google\u2019s folding phone in this key area.\nIt will also likely have strong battery life and charging\nThen there\u2019s the battery and charging; like the rest of the Pixel 10 series, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold features Google\u2019s PixelSnap charging solution, which is otherwise known as Qi2 charging, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the first folding phone to have this feature built in. This means it supports magnetic wireless charging at up to 15W charging speeds, but unlike the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it doesn\u2019t require a case to enable Qi2 charging.\nAs well as a big improvement in wireless charging, Google has also increased the battery size of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold to a 5,015 mAh battery, almost eight percent larger than the 4,650 mAh battery in the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. This is paired with faster 30W charging, which Google claims can charge the Pixel 10 Pro Fold to 50% in just 30 minutes.\nCharging speeds were a notable criticism of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold last year, and the improvements in both wired and wireless speeds this year make this a strong contender if you\u2019re looking for the best folding phone for battery life in the US.\nA new era for the Tensor processor\nMuch like several other of its features, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold also features the new Tensor G5 processor that powers the rest of the Pixel 10 series. This marks a watershed moment for Google\u2019s nascent processor efforts, as the company has switched foundries from Samsung to TSMC, the same chipmaker that builds the chipsets used in many of the world\u2019s best phones.\nThis is the most significant upgrade to the Tensor processor lineup since its launch five years ago, featuring deeper customization and being custom-designed for the latest advancements in Google Gemini.\nThe Tensor G5 is built on the same 3nm processor used in most chipsets, and according to Google, the CPU is on average 34% faster than the Tensor G4 used last year. The Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) \u2014 a specialized ASIC designed by Google to accelerate machine learning records \u2014 has also been vastly improved and is now 60% more powerful than the TPU in the Tensor G4.\nAlongside these notable improvements, the Tensor G5 also brings a host of improvements, including much faster on-device AI performance and an upgraded ISP for better photography. The Tensor G5 is paired with 16GB of RAM and should yield vastly improved performance for a true flagship experience.\nSeveral new Gemini, AI, and software features\nAs you might expect from Google, there\u2019s a host of new Gemini, AI, and software features designed to take advantage of the unique form factor of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.\nAll of Google\u2019s new Pixel 10 lineup features a new set of helpful, proactive suggestions throughout the UI, which are designed to help surface information before you know that you need it.\nThe highlight of these new features is MagicCue, which leverages the Tensor G5 processor and Google\u2019s Gemini Nano model for real-time processing of information to enable contextual suggestions. These can include things like adding events, previewing weather forecasts for upcoming trips, and settling a bill, but Google says this will become much more useful the more you use the phone.\nThere\u2019s also a new Daily Hub, a personalized digest with upcoming calendar events and other pertinent information, as well as new AI-powered real-time translation of voice calls, with the person on the other end able to hear the translation in their language but in your voice. There are also improvements to call screening as well as the wider suite of Gemini-powered features that have become synonymous with Google\u2019s smartphone lineup.\nThere\u2019s just one big flaw with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold\nIn a vacuum, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold would be fairly impressive, but other smartphones exist. While the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is mighty impressive, it also has one major drawback: the thickness, as mentioned earlier.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold measures 5.1mm thick when unfolded and 10.5mm thick when folded, which made it slimmer than the Galaxy Z Fold 6 last year. However, while Samsung has made the Galaxy Z Fold 7 much thinner this year \u2014 it measures 4.2 mm and 8.9 mm, respectively \u2014 Google chose not to follow suit, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold measures 5.2mm thick when unfolded, and 10.8mm when folded.\nAlongside this, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is also heavier than the competition. Weighing 258 grams, it is one gram heavier than last year, but 43 grams heavier than the Galaxy Z Fold 7, or almost 17 percent. This additional weight is immediately noticeable, and the size remains the biggest flaw I noticed with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold in my brief time with it. It still feels incredibly premium in the hand, but it\u2019s noticeably bulkier than the Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nIs it a deal-breaker? We\u2019ll find out in our full review, but for now, it\u2019s one big flaw that detracts from an otherwise excellent folding phone.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is available to pre-order today (August 20) for the same $1,799 price as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, but it won\u2019t be released until October 9. It comes in two colors \u2014 Moonstone and Jade \u2014 and while the price is high, the best Pixel 10 deals can help take the sting out of the price tag."

      "text": "What\u2019s happened? Belkin has launched \u201cthe world\u2019s first Qi2 25W certified wireless charging collection\u201d, for the easy wireless charging of your iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods. But it\u2019s not just Apple\u2019s devices which will benefit from the new chargers.\n- Google announced its new Pixel 10 series earlier in the week, the first major Android phones to have Qi2 built-in, which means they\u2019re compatible with MagSafe accessories for iPhone.\n- The three new chargers from Belkin are compatible with a range of Apple handsets, from the iPhone 12 through to the latest iPhone 16 (but the iPhone 16e isn\u2019t supported).\n- The Belkin Ultracharge 3in1 and UltraCharge 3in1 Pro offer simultaneous wireless charging for iPhone, Apple Watch and Airpods, while the the Ultracharge 2in1 can top up your phone and AirPods.\nThis is important because: Android phone owners have been looking enviously at the MagSafe compatibility on iPhones for a number of years. Sure there have been phone cases which sort of solve it, but with Google\u2019s introduction of Qi2 on the Pixel 10 series, the market is primed for exciting expansion.\n- The Qi2 standard allows for wireless charging speeds up to 25W, which is a decent chunk faster than the 15W max with Qi1.\n- With more phone supporting the Qi2 standard, we\u2019ll see more charging accessories, mounts, and stands come to market, bringing greater versatility to our devices.\n- Qi2 adoption will also make it easier to switch phone brands, if your Qi2 accessories are also compatible with handsets from other manufacturers.\nWhy should I care? If you\u2019re an iPhone owner, you\u2019ll be able to wirelessly charge your phone faster, while prospective Pixel 10 owners have even more Qi2 accessories to choose from.\n- Belkin says its new chargers can replenish an iPhone from 0-50% in 29 minutes, while the 3in1 Pro can get an Apple Watch from 0-80% in the same time.\n- Over on Google\u2019s side of the fence, only the Pixel 10 Pro XL \u2013 equipped with Qi2.2 \u2013 can wirelessly charge at 25W. The Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro Fold top out at 15W.\nOkay, what\u2019s next? Belkin\u2019s new trio of chargers are available to buy now.\n- UltraCharge 3in1 Pro price: $129.99\n- UltraCharge 3in1 price: $99.99\n- UltraCharge 2in1 price: $59.99\n- And if you want to pair them with a shiny new Google phone, we\u2019ve found the best Pixel 10 pre-order deals."

      "text": "There are two types of flagship phone users out there. The first kind are considered early adopters because they\u2019re always interested in the latest and greatest features, whether it be in cameras, battery, performance, or display. Then there\u2019s the second kind, who values the latest features and specifications, but is also conscious about the price.\nIf you\u2019re in the latter group, you\u2019ll find your options fit into two distinct categories, judged by the number of smartphone cameras. On the one hand, the Galaxy S25 and OnePlus 13 are both priced at between $800 and $1000, and feature three cameras complete with strong zoom performance.\nThen there\u2019s the other category for phones with two cameras, commonly associated with the entry-level iPhone 16 and prior. Another key competitor in this category is last year\u2019s Google Pixel 9, and today Google unveiled its successor, the Google Pixel 10, in New York. There are many changes, but the biggest is clear: the first telephoto lens on a base Pixel.\nI went hands-on with the Pixel 10 for half an hour earlier today, and one thing became apparent almost immediately: this could make the Pixel 10 one of the best value-for-money phones you can buy. Here\u2019s why.\nOne more camera makes all the difference\nThe Pixel 10 marks a significant shift for Google, moving from competing with the dual-camera-wielding iPhone 16 to the triple-camera-toting Galaxy S25. On paper, the new telephoto lens is the only change, but the changes in the Pixel 10 camera extend much further.\nThe main camera drops slightly from a 50MP sensor in the Pixel 9 to the 48MP wide sensor in the Pixel 10 with the same f/1.7 aperture and 25mm focal length. Then there\u2019s the ultra-wide camera, which drops from a 48MP sensor with f/1.7 aperture to a smaller 12MP sensor.\nThis drop in the ultra-wide is almost certainly due to the new telephoto, and the Pixel 10 features the same 10.8MP telephoto lens found in the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold. This sensor delivers 5x optical zoom, but lacks the Pro Res Zoom feature for up to 100x zoom that\u2019s found in the Pixel 10 Pro series with the same telephoto camera.\nDespite the other changes to the camera, the new telephoto lens on the Pixel 10 is a welcome improvement for anyone who\u2019s buying a phone at this price point. Yes, the rest of the camera has some downgrades, but three cameras and a strong telephoto would likely appeal more to customers than two better lenses.\nA new era for the Tensor processor\nThe Pixel 10 also sees the launch of the Tensor G5, the fifth-generation processor designed by Google. This change also marks a watershed moment, as Google has switched from Samsung Foundry to the world\u2019s largest chipmaker, TSMC.\nThe Tensor G5 is built on TSMC\u2019s 3nm process, which is the same architecture used in rival flagship chipsets powering phones like the iPhone 16 Pro, Galaxy S25 Ultra, and Galaxy Z Fold 7. The shift to the 3nm process brings a host of improvements for Google to take advantage of, specifically when it comes to AI performance. The Tensor G5 is paired with 12GB of RAM.\nGoogle says the Tensor G5 offers deeper customization and is custom-built to support the latest advancements in AI. The Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is 60% more powerful, ensuring much faster performance in machine learning and on-device AI. The Tensor G5 also features a 34% faster CPU as well as an upgraded ISP for better camera performance.\nBigger battery and better charging\nLike the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup, Google has made the battery slightly larger at 4,970 mAh. Unlike the Google Pixel 9a \u2014 which features the largest battery in a Pixel at 5,100 mAh \u2014 the Pixel 10 is only slightly larger than the Pixel 9.\nBattery life was a strong part of the Pixel 9 experience last year, and the larger battery should ensure this continues this year. However, the Tensor G5 consumes more power, so there shouldn\u2019t be a significant increase in overall battery life.\nThere have also been improvements to charging. The Pixel 10 charging speeds jump from 27W to 29W, which Google says can charge the phone up to 55% in around 30 minutes, when used with a 30W charger. Like most phones, there\u2019s no charging brick in the box.\nThe biggest change in the battery this year is the addition of Qi2 magnetic wireless charging. Dubbed PixelSnap, the feature allows the Pixel 10 to charge wirelessly at up to 15W using a MagSafe-compatible charger. The Pixel 10 is the first Android phone to feature this built-in; while Samsung ensures the best Samsung phones are Qi2-compatible, they require an additional case to take advantage of the feature.\nSoftware is Google\u2019s strong point\u2026 yet again\nAs you might expect, the Pixel 10 runs Android 16, the latest version of Android, out of the box alongside Google\u2019s Material 3 Expressive UI. The Pixel 10 is also backed by seven years of software and security updates, meaning it should be supported to at least Android 23.\nBeyond the core platform, the Pixel 10 also comes equipped with several new AI features as part of Gemini, and some of these are set to be exclusive to the Pixel range.\nFirst, there\u2019s Magic Cue, which leverages the Tensor G5 processor and Google\u2019s Gemini Nano model for real-time processing of your usage to enable contextual suggestions. These suggestions can include adding events to the calendar, previewing weather forecasts, or settling a bill, with Google set to expand this feature considerably over the coming months.\nOne particular point of note is that Magic Cue is designed to surface suggestions that Google thinks you need before you need to ask for them. As such, the more you use the Pixel 10, the better the training of the models; as a result, suggestions should become far more accurate and frequent as you use your phone.\nThere is also a wide range of other changes throughout the OS. Google\u2019s Veo 3 model is now available on phones, while a new Daily Hub provides a daily digest that\u2019s similar to Now Brief on the Galaxy S25. There are also improvements to Call Screening and a new addition to voice calls, with the Pixel 10 able to translate your call in real-time.\nThe Pixel 10 proves that affordable doesn\u2019t mean compromises\nThe Pixel 9 was one of the best phones last year, and the myriad of changes in the Pixel 10 mean it goes further than just picking up the mantle; starting at $799, the Pixel 10 is likely to be the best $800 phone that you can buy.\nLike the Google Pixel 9a and prior, the Pixel 10 proves that affordable doesn\u2019t have to mean big compromises, and while there are some lesser specs compared to the Pixel 9, the Pixel 10 is a more complete all-around phone for most people.\nThere\u2019s one big thing to also keep in mind: Google has followed Apple\u2019s lead, and the Pixel 10 is eSIM-only in the US, meaning it doesn\u2019t come with a physical SIM card tray like the iPhone 16 series. It\u2019s a shame that Google has gone eSIM-only, but it does feel inevitable that the industry as a whole will eventually follow.\nGoogle Pixel 10 price and availability\nThe Pixel 10 is available to pre-order starting at $799, which comes with 128GB of storage. Pre-orders open today (August 20) ahead of the release date on August 28. If you want additional storage, you can double the storage for a $100 premium, but 256GB is the largest available storage capacity.\nThe Pixel 10 series comes in four distinct colors: Obsidian, Frost, Lemongrass, and Indigo. The latter is my favorite color, but Lemongrass is also a beautiful shade of green. This might be Google\u2019s best color lineup as all four colors look fantastic in person."

      "text": "Apple\u2019s smartphones have built a reputation as some of the best phones around. The honor is well-earned, as they offer a blend of fluid software with useful features and top-notch hardware that will last you for years. Over recent few years, capabilities like global device location tracking and satellite communication support have further propped up their appeal.\nApple has, expectedly, diversified the iPhone range to serve customers with different demands and budgets. As a result, it can get a bit overwhelming to decide which iPhone is best for you. Here\u2019s our full guide on the iPhone situation to assist you with your next purchase.\nWhat is the Apple iPhone?\nEvery brand picks a name for its phones. Some go with special names, or just numbers attached to the brand name. In 2007, Apple picked \u201ciPhone\u201d for its first handset, and the name\u2019s stuck with every iPhone released to date. There\u2019s a rich history behind it.\n\u201cAn iPod, a phone and an internet communicator. An iPod, a phone \u2014 are you getting it? These are not separate devices. This is one device. And we are calling it iPhone,\u201d Apple co-founder and CEO, Steve Jobs, explained when he introduced the world to the first iPhone.\nWhat\u2019s the newest iPhone?\nThe latest iPhone to launch was the iPhone 16e in February 2025. It\u2019s a budget-centric device that focuses on delivering the signature iPhone experience at a lower price and a few feature cuts in tow.\nIf we focus on the latest mainstream iPhones, those include the iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, and 16 Pro Max \u2013 launched together in September 2024.\nOur latest iPhone reviews\nAt Digital Trends, we have reviewed every iPhone that is currently on the store shelf. The iPhone 16e won praise for its compact size, strong camera, and great battery life. The mainline iPhone 16 offered a great mix of vibrant design, custom buttons, and reliable performance.\nThe lack of a high-refresh-rate screen and fast charging on a phone that costs at least $800 earned it some valid criticism. Then we have the iPhone 16 Pro and its Max versions, both of which stand tall as two of the best camera phones you can get your hands on at the moment.\nThe next iPhone\nThe iPhone 17 series is expected to plan in land in the Fall season, and if Apple sticks to its usual schedule, the devices should go on sale towards the end of September. Apple is rumored to introduce four new smartphones, but instead of the usual \u201cPlus\u201d model, we could get a new \u201cAir\u201d variant.\nAs per the leaks, the iPhone 17 will look the same as its predecessor. On the iPhone 17 series, Apple is going with a much larger camera bump to accommodate upgraded imaging hardware.\nThe iPhone 17 Air could feature a single camera and a slightly taller display, and will be among the thinnest phones out there.\nEvery iPhone variant explained\nApple currently has five different iPhones listed for sale. For an average buyer, picking between them can get confusing, especially with the names, features, and the narrow price gap between a few of them. Let\u2019s break it down.\nThe \u2018e\u2019\nThe \u201ce\u201d model, or the iPhone 16e, is the spiritual successor of the iPhone SE. Starting at $599, it\u2019s all about offering the fluid iOS experience running atop signature iPhone hardware, and the ecosystem benefits that come with it.\nThink of it as a no-frills, no-fuss device for people who seek the comfort of Apple\u2019s smartphone ecosystem without too many demands.\nThe vanilla and \u2018Plus\u2019\nThe vanilla iPhone 16 is where we enter the \u201clatest and greatest\u201d territory. It combines a fast processor, more cameras, a modern design, and the best iOS experience. For most people, it will get the job done.\nIf you need a larger screen and a bigger battery, the \u201cPlus\u201d model, aka the iPhone 16 Plus, is where you should put your money. The rest of the package remains the same.\n\u2018Pro\u2019 and \u2018Pro Max\u2019\nThen we have the \u201cPro\u201d and \u201cPro Max\u201d iPhones, the best that Apple has to offer. These stand out with a triple camera setup, advanced features focused on creators, a more premium build, better screens, and the fastest smartphone processor from Apple.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max offer one of the most consistently reliable and advanced camera tools you will find on a phone out there.\nWhat iPhone do I have?\nEach year, Apple launches smartphones with a fresh set of features, alongside next-gen software. Sometimes, these new capabilities are locked, but on a few occasions, they also make it to older iPhones. For an average user, it can get confusing whether the iPhone in their hand supports these features being advertised everywhere.\nThe best way forward is to confirm the model name and year of your iPhone. It can be done by following this path: Settings > General > About. Here, you can also check the software version and the warranty details of your iPhone, as well.\nHow much does an iPhone cost?\nThe pricing of current-generation Apple smartphones starts at $599 for the iPhone 16e. Going up, you have the iPhone 16, with a base price of $799, while the iPhone 16 Plus will set you back $899.\nThe starting price of the iPhone 16 Pro is $999, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max is currently up for grabs at $1,199.\nYou can save some money by picking up a previous-generation iPhone without losing too many features. Apple still sells the iPhone 15 and its Plus variant at a discount price starting at $699 in the US.\nWhich iPhone should I buy?\nBuying an iPhone can be a tad confusing, especially when Apple sells no less than five iPhones from its latest 16 series, and two of the previous-generation models, as well. Here\u2019s a quick rundown on how to pick the right one.\nIf you are looking for an entry-level iPhone that gets the basic bits right and your budget can\u2019t go beyond $599, the iPhone 16e is your best bet. For folks after a slightly more modern package in terms of looks, features, and future-proofing, the iPhone 16 is the right choice at a sticker price of $799.\nAssuming battery mileage is what you seek, and you\u2019re not averse to a slightly bigger screen, the iPhone 16 Plus should be the right investment. At a slightly lower asking price (and no Apple Intelligence), the iPhone 15 is still a great choice at $699.\nIn case the budget is not a constraint and you only want the best that Apple has to offer in terms of camera and silicon capabilities, the iPhone 16 Pro is the ideal choice and a worthy $999 investment.\nBut if you intend to push it at creative tasks like long video capture and gaming, a larger battery and screen will come in handy. For this type of workflow, the $1,199 iPhone 16 Pro Max should serve you just fine."

      "text": "Apple will likely showcase iOS 19 (or will it be called iOS 26?), the next version of its iPhone operating system, at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC 2025) on June 9.\nAs well as giving us our first official look at iOS 19 / iOS 26, we expect Apple to also introduce us to iPadOS 19, watchOS 12, and macOS 16, plus a healthy amount of talk about Apple Intelligence.\nThis update could prove significant for iPhone owners if the current rumors are true. Here\u2019s what we know know so far, including a report which suggests iOS 19 might actually be called iOS 26.\nLatest iOS 19 / iOS 26 news\n- June 8: Gurman says Apple will introduce \u201cnew interface elements\u2026called Liquid Glass, and they have the sheen and see-through visuals of a glassy surface\u201d\n- June 6: Apple tipster Mark Gurman reveals comprehensive list of what he expects Apple to announce at WWDC\nWill iOS 19 actually be called iOS 26?\nAccording to prominent Apple tipster Mark Gurman, Apple is preparing a major shake-up to the nomenclature of its operating systems.\nGurman reports that Apple will bring all of its operating systems in line with the same numeric handle, relating not to the version number of the software, but the year.\nMuch like the auto industry and major sporting game franchises, such as Madden and EA Sports FC, Apple will opt for the upcoming full year rather than the year the software is announced.\nThe result? We could be introduced to iOS 26, rather than iOS 19.\nWhen will iOS 19 / iOS 26 be revealed?\nApple has announced that this year\u2019s WWDC will kick off with a keynote address on Monday, June 9, starting at 10 am PDT / 1pm EDT.\nYou can follow our WWDC 2025 live blog for all the latest on the from the keynote presentation, and if you want to keep a closer eye on proceedings, here\u2019s how to watch the WWDC 2025 keynote.\nIn previous years, we\u2019ve seen Apple officially unveil the latest generation of iOS during the WWDC keynote \u2013 and we expect the Cupertino, California-based firm to continue this trend for iOS 19.\nIf accurate, it would mean iOS 19 / iOS 26 will be revealed on June 9, 2025 \u2013 although you may have to wait until September before it\u2019s officially available to download on your iPhone.\nWhen will iOS 19 / iOS 26 be available?\nLast year, iOS 18 was announced at WWDC in June, but didn\u2019t land on iPhones until September 16, 2024.\nThe first public version of iOS 19 / iOS 26 is expected to be released around the same time as Apple launches its iPhone 17 series in September. Prior to this, beta versions will likely be available for testing following the preview at WWDC.\niOS 19 / iOS 26: expected features\nAccording to Bloomberg reports, iOS 19 / iOS 26 will bring \u201cone of the most dramatic software overhauls\u201d in Apple\u2019s history, described as \u201cthe biggest revamp since iOS 7\u201d in 2013.\nThe update will apparently \u201cfundamentally change\u201d the operating system\u2019s look with a redesigned interface that will update \u201cthe style of icons, menus, apps, windows, and system buttons.\u201d\nThe new design is expected to include more translucent menus and elements similar to those found in visionOS, the software platform for Apple Vision Pro. This design shift seeks to create a more immersive and visually appealing user experience. For example, one leaked screenshot shows a redesigned Camera app that features translucent menus, giving the app a modern look and making it easier to navigate.\nApparently the Phone, Safari and Camera apps are going to see a major revamp, but Apple\u2019s other core iOS apps are only going to get cosmetic updates.\nApple\u2019s also being tipped to bring new pre-installed apps to the new version of iOS, with Previews (a PDF reader and editor) and Games (a hub for games and Arcade) rumored to be announced during the WWDC 2025 keynote.\nThere has been speculation that Apple would switch the app icons on iOS from squares to circles, to match watchOS and visionOS, but Gurman doesn\u2019t expect this to happen in iOS 19 / iOS 26.\nAdditionally, the overall feel of the app may be smoother, with animations that enhance the translucency, creating a seamless and cohesive interaction. This approach aligns with Apple\u2019s previous innovations and reinforces its commitment to enhancing user engagement with its devices.\niOS 19 / iOS 26 is also anticipated to build on the Apple Intelligence features introduced in iOS 18, with significant enhancements aimed at creating a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. One of the standout upgrades will be a \u201cmore conversational Siri,\u201d bolstered by advancements in large language models.\nThis will empower Siri to better understand and execute complex commands, making interactions feel more natural and fluid.\nIn terms of functionality, this revamped Siri will have enhanced personal context awareness, allowing it to tailor responses based on user habits and preferences. For example, it could proactively suggest reminders or respond to queries about your schedule or location with more relevant information.\nOnscreen awareness will also be improved, enabling Siri to better interact with what\u2019s displayed on your device, responding contextually to apps or content currently in use.\nAdditionally, Siri\u2019s integration with third-party applications is expected to become much smoother. This means users might be able to use Siri to navigate apps or retrieve information in a way that feels seamless and integrated, enhancing overall productivity.\nApple may showcase this version of Siri during the iOS 19 / iOS 26 announcement. However, the rollout of these features may not occur until spring 2026. Recall that Apple has already delayed many of these same Siri features, which were supposed to launch with iOS 18.x.\nMeanwhile, iOS 19 / iOS 26 is anticipated to offer enhanced support for Rich Communication Services (RCS), incorporating features from the latest RCS versions. This could include custom emoji reactions, editing and deleting messages, better spam handling, and end-to-end encrypted RCS messages.\nAlthough not specifically mentioned in recent leaks, iOS 19 / iOS 26 is likely to include significant improvements to the Home app, HomeKit, and related services. Apple is expected to introduce a new range of smart home products throughout 2025 and 2026.\nBesides the redesign, Apple is expected to bring features that improve our interaction with the iPhone, such as a new battery management suite to conserve power based on usage patterns. Apple is expected to use AI to make the iPhones\u2019 battery last longer, but this may only be available for devices that support Apple Intelligence.\nThe optimizations may also be beneficial for Apple\u2019s upcoming slim phone, the iPhone 17 Air, which may have a smaller battery than most regularly sized devices.\nAdditionally, iOS 19 / iOS 26 is suggested to bring seamless sign-in for public Wi-Fi networks where you will only have to sign in on any one of your Apple devices while others will automatically get access.\nApple has also confirmed a slew of accessibility features, including better magnification, support for braille input devices, and voiceover features will be available across a range of iPhone models with iOS 19 / iOS 26.\nWhich devices will support iOS 19 / iOS 26?\nBack in December 2024, it was reported that all devices capable of running iOS 18 would also support iOS 19 / iOS 26. However, more recent rumors suggest that Apple may be dropping support for some of the older models, including the iPhone XR and iPhone XS, and XS Max, which were released back in 2018.\niPhone 11 and newer models, including the iPhone SE models from 2020 and 2022, should receive the iOS 19 / iOS 26 update.\nAs with previous iOS updates, certain older models may not be able to utilize all the new features in iOS 19 / iOS 26, as some features will require specific chipsets to function. Apple has already clarified that Apple\u2019s Intelligence tools will only be available on the upcoming iPhone 17 series, iPhone 16 series, and the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max."

      "text": "\u201cThe iPhone 14 isn't a huge upgrade compared to its predecessor. But with a great design, screen, performance, and cameras, that's far from a bad thing at all.\u201d\n- Comfortable, high-end build\n- OLED screen looks fantastic\n- A15 chip performs great\n- Good camera upgrades\n- Dependable battery life\n- Helpful safety features\n- 60Hz display\n- No telephoto camera\n- eSIM might be a pain for some\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another iPhone.\u201d That\u2019s how I\u2019ve heard a lot of people refer to the iPhone 14 \u2014 and for good reason. Compared to last year\u2019s model, the iPhone 14 is a very familiar smartphone. It has the same design, screen, chipset, and a very similar camera system.\nBut here\u2019s the thing. Those similarities shouldn\u2019t come as a disappointment. The iPhone 14 takes a very strong foundation, keeps what works, and adds a few subtle improvements that make it a better overall handset. It\u2019s far from the year\u2019s most invigorating or jaw-dropping release, but if what you\u2019re in the market for is \u201cjust another iPhone,\u201d the iPhone 14 makes a great case for itself.\nIf you\u2019re more interested in Apple\u2019s higher-end models, see our iPhone 14 Pro review and iPhone 14 Pro Max review.\niPhone 14 design\nThis welcome familiarity is seen immediately with the iPhone 14\u2019s design. The iPhone 14 still has a 6.1-inch display with a notch, Apple\u2019s Ceramic Shield covering that display, and an aerospace-grade aluminum frame. You\u2019re also treated to the same square camera housing on the back with the angled sensors, though they are slightly larger than the iPhone 13. The iPhone 14 is also 0.15mm thicker and 2g heavier, but otherwise, it\u2019s the same looking and feeling phone as last year.\nIn my book, this is nary a bad thing at all. Maybe it\u2019s because I switched to the iPhone 14 from my much heavier iPhone 13 Pro, but the iPhone 14 feels wonderful to hold. It\u2019s sturdy, lightweight, and the aluminum sides are impervious to fingerprints.\nI also quite like Apple\u2019s selection of colors this year. Apple sent me the iPhone 14 in purple, which looks like a muted lavender in person. It\u2019s very subtle and not too vibrant, but I\u2019ve loved carrying it around with me while reviewing the iPhone 14. The redesigned blue color is also great (and looks better than the iPhone 13\u2019s blue, in my opinion). The red color is significantly more vibrant this year, plus midnight and starlight remain trusty neutral options.\nThe iPhone 14 feels wonderful to hold.\nOther mainstays of the iPhone 13 are also present on the iPhone 14. An IP68 rating protects it from dust and water, it\u2019s fully compatible with MagSafe accessories, and \u2014 yes \u2014 there is still a Lightning port on the bottom instead of USB-C.\nIs this a fresh or exciting design? Not at all. Aside from the different colors, the iPhone 14 really does look identical to the iPhone 13. I get that some people were hoping for a drastic redesign, but I\u2019m happy Apple stuck with this body for another generation. The iPhone 14 has proven practical and comfortable in daily use, and it has looked good while doing so. Call it boring if you want, but it\u2019s a smartphone design I can\u2019t help but thoroughly enjoy.\niPhone 14 screen\nApple\u2019s recycling of last year\u2019s hardware also works out well for the screen \u2026 mostly.\nThe iPhone 14 is equipped with a 6.1-inch OLED screen with a 2532 x 1170 resolution. There\u2019s HDR support, up to 800 nits of max typical brightness, and 1,200 nits of peak HDR brightness \u2014 all the same specs we got with the iPhone 13.\nIn almost every regard, this remains a great display setup for the iPhone 14. Colors are punchy (but not overly saturated), text and icons look great, and the display is plenty visible in bright rooms or outside on a sunny day. Whether I\u2019m watching a YouTube video, looking at old photos, or reading an article from one of my colleagues, the iPhone 14\u2019s screen allows all of it to pop.\nWhere the iPhone 14 display disappoints is with its refresh rate. Like the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max last year, the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max again have 120Hz screens. The baseline iPhone 14, however, is again stuck with a 60Hz one. Compared to phones with 120 or 90Hz refresh rates, things like scrolling and swiping look choppier on the iPhone 14.\nBeing stuck with 60Hz on the iPhone 14 is a shame.\niOS 16\u2019s smooth animations and the great performance out of the A15 Bionic keep the iPhone 14 from ever feeling slow or sluggish, but it\u2019s still disappointing not to see any improvement here. In the Android space, it\u2019s not uncommon to see phones for $600, $500, or even $400 with 90 or 120Hz refresh rates. Being stuck with 60Hz on the iPhone 14, a phone that starts at $799, is a shame.\niPhone 14 cameras\nThe iPhone 14 Pro has stolen most of the camera limelight for its new 48MP primary sensor, but that doesn\u2019t mean the normal iPhone 14 is a slouch. Like so many other aspects of the phone, the iPhone 14\u2019s cameras are a lot like the iPhone 13 but slightly improved in some key ways.\nYou still have a 12MP primary camera, but it\u2019s a larger sensor with an f/1.5 aperture to capture more light and make lowlight shots look better. The front-facing camera is even more improved. The megapixel count remains at 12MP, but it has a larger f/1.9 aperture (compared to f/2.2 on previous iPhones) and introduces autofocus for the first time. The 12MP ultrawide camera is exactly as it was on the iPhone 14\u2019s predecessor.\nSounds great! But what does any of this mean for photo quality? Starting with the 12MP main camera, it has all of the same qualities we saw with the iPhone 13. In good lighting conditions, the iPhone 14 can produce truly gorgeous photos. Colors are vibrant and true to life, images have a load of fine details, and the Camera app captures photos quickly for fast, trustworthy shooting. And in these well-lit conditions, the larger sensor gives some subjects a natural depth of field, allowing you to get portrait-like shots without using the dedicated Portrait mode.\nI\u2019ve also been mostly happy with lowlight images. In a dark room at night with minimal lighting, the iPhone 14 can still take very good photos with ample detail (the photo of my cat sleeping on a pillow is a great example).\nFor scenes that are really dark, the iPhone 14 automatically switches to Night mode. It\u2019ll automatically hold exposure for around 2 or 5 seconds, but you can force it to go on for 30 seconds if you really need it. In these scenarios, the iPhone 14 does a good job of letting ample light into to turn a pitch-black scene into something that\u2019s actually visible. But the more you bring the lights down, the softer and softer details become.\nWhat about the ultrawide camera? Even though it\u2019s the same as the iPhone 13\u2019s, it\u2019s been extremely reliable during my testing. Colors are nearly identical to the main camera, the wider view is helpful, and details look pretty good considering the ultrawide nature of the thing.\nAnd, of course, we have to talk about the new selfie camera. I\u2019ll say upfront that I\u2019m not a selfie guy. I\u2019ve never been one to take a lot of selfies, and I don\u2019t anticipate that the iPhone 14 will change that about me. But even so, it\u2019s pretty remarkable how much better the iPhone 14\u2019s new selfie camera really is.\nThanks to the addition of autofocus, photos generally look sharper all around. From finer details in your hair and face to taking up-close shots of you and your friends, autofocus adds a new layer of flexibility that can really take selfies to the next level. And like the main camera, the larger aperture results in better natural bokeh and decent results even when the lights go down.\niPhone 14 performance\nOne of the most controversial changes with the iPhone 14 is something that didn\u2019t change at all. Usually, Apple gives every new iPhone a new chipset to power it. The iPhone 12 series got the A14 chip, the iPhone 13 lineup was powered by the A15, and all iPhone 14 handsets have the A16 \u2014 right? Not exactly.\nWhile the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max have a new A16 chipset, the iPhone 14 (and iPhone 14 Plus) still have the A15. It\u2019s the more powerful version of the A15 used in the iPhone 13 Pro with five GPU cores instead of the four used in the normal iPhone 13, but otherwise, it\u2019s the exact same processor.\nThere\u2019s been plenty of backlash against this decision as another way for Apple to stifle innovation and save a buck. And maybe it is! But I\u2019d be lying if I said I was upset about having the A15 in the iPhone 14.\nThe A15 is still an incredible mobile chipset.\nSimply put, this is still an incredible mobile chipset. Daily apps like Twitter, Outlook, and Instagram run without a hitch. Games are great, too. I\u2019ve played a lot of Call of Duty: Mobile on the iPhone 14, and from the graphics to frame rate, everything performs perfectly. The iPhone 14 also touts a new thermal design, giving you better heat dissipation compared to the iPhone 13. I only got the iPhone 14 to get noticeably warm once during testing, and that was after 30+ minutes of downloading numerous files for CoD: Mobile with the display on. Otherwise, the phone has run cool as a cucumber regardless of which apps or games I\u2019m running.\niPhone 14 eSIM\nSpeaking of controversy, we should take a minute to talk about eSIM. If you buy an iPhone 14 in the U.S, it doesn\u2019t come with a physical SIM card. Instead, cellular service is only accessed via a virtual eSIM. We\u2019ve had eSIM technology in smartphones for years, but the iPhone 14 is the first major smartphone to only have eSIM and no option for a physical SIM card.\nIn my own experience, this hasn\u2019t been a problem at all. I already had my number as an eSIM on my iPhone 13 Pro and transferred it to the iPhone 14 in about two minutes. Apple guides you through this process during setup, and you can access eSIM transfer/activation settings at any time in the Settings app. And even if you have an older iPhone that\u2019s still using a physical SIM card, Apple\u2019s worked with major carriers in the U.S. to make the transfer process as seamless as possible.\nWhile I\u2019ve had no issues with eSIM on the iPhone 14, that doesn\u2019t mean it hasn\u2019t been causing headaches for some people. If you have service through a smaller provider like Mint Mobile, transferring your SIM may require using your carrier\u2019s app or having to call customer service. Transferring your SIM from an Android phone also comes with its own headaches, and there have been some reports of eSIM transfers taking hours (or even days) with some numbers.\nJust transferred a T-Mobile eSIM from a 13 Pro to a 14 and yeah\u2014 the whole process for transferring eSIMs is shockingly quick and simple\neSIM isn\u2019t without its faults, but it\u2019s also not the big scary monster some are making it out to be https://t.co/gHNg6KKs2O\n\u2014 Joe Maring (@JoeMaring1) September 15, 2022\nThis is one of those things where your mileage will vary. If you\u2019re coming to the iPhone 14 from an old iPhone, the eSIM transfer process should be fairly simple \u2014 regardless if you\u2019re already using eSIM or still have a physical SIM card. Things stand to be more complicated if you\u2019re switching from an Android phone, and if you plan on doing a lot of international travel, there are challenges to consider there, too. There\u2019s certainly still work to be done here, and although eSIM is far from perfect, it hasn\u2019t done anything to tarnish my time with the iPhone 14. Here\u2019s to hoping Apple and carriers can make that the case for everyone sooner rather than later.\niPhone 14 car crash detection and satellite connectivity\nTwo other big features with the iPhone 14 are car crash detection and satellite connectivity \u2014 two features I\u2019ve been unable to try with my iPhone 14.\nThe former is pretty self-explanatory. If you\u2019re involved in a severe car crash, the iPhone 14 uses a variety of sensors to detect changes in speed and cabin pressure, extremely loud sounds, and a sudden shift in the direction you\u2019re heading. If it determines that you were involved in an accident, the iPhone 14 displays a car crash screen with buttons to call emergency services or dismiss the pop-up. If you don\u2019t respond within 10 seconds, emergency services are automatically called for you. Apple says it used 1 million hours of \u201creal-world driving and crash data\u201d to build the iPhone 14\u2019s car crash detection. Short of me getting in an accident to test the feature myself, I\u2019ll take Apple at its word that the feature works as intended.\nIn a similar vein, the iPhone 14 also brings Emergency SOS via satellite. If you\u2019re in a situation where you need help but don\u2019t have access to cellular data or a Wi-Fi connection, the iPhone 14 allows you to connect to a satellite and send a message to emergency services. Like car crash detection, it\u2019s one of those features you hope you never have to use.\nRegardless, I\u2019m really glad Apple added these things this year. Yearly improvements to processor speed, display resolution, and camera megapixels are great. But these are features that could legitimately save your life. Apple\u2019s marketing may lay it thick with the severity of them, but there is weight to what the company is saying. I pray that I never get in a bad car wreck or become injured and stranded somewhere, but in the event that I do, it\u2019s reassuring to know that the iPhone 14 has the necessary tools to be useful in those situations.\niPhone 14 battery and charging\nFinally, let\u2019s talk about battery life. Apple made significant battery strides with the iPhone 13 series, and with the iPhone 14, it claims that endurance is even better. While I\u2019m not hitting the 20 hours of video playback Apple touts on its website, the iPhone 14 has consistently gotten me through each day I\u2019ve used it \u2014 even when I\u2019m really pushing it.\nHere\u2019s what a typical day with the iPhone 14 has looked like for me, I\u2019ll watch about an hour of YouTube, play 30-ish minutes of Call of Duty: Mobile, and regularly use countless other apps like Twitter, Safari, Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Apple Music, and more throughout the day. After over 14 hours of uptime with over 5.5 hours of screen-on time, I have about 25% battery life left in the tank.\nOn a lighter day with over 15 hours of use and about 4 hours of screen time (with very little gaming), I ended the day with 38% still remaining. The iPhone 14 will likely be a one-day phone for most people, but I\u2019ve been able to very comfortably get through each day even with fairly heavy usage. Play a few games, watch some videos, and take as many pictures as you want. So long as you aren\u2019t on your phone 24/7, you should be able to end each day with the iPhone 14 with little-to-no battery anxiety.\nApple didn\u2019t make any charging improvements this year, but the options available are fine. You can use the Lightning port to get wired charging speeds up to 25W, Qi wireless charging delivers up to 7.5W, and a supported MagSafe charger (my preferred method of charging) delivers up to 15W of power. There\u2019s no ultra-fast wired charging like you\u2019ll find on the OnePlus 10T or Oppo Reno 8 Pro, but maybe Apple will get around to adding that next year with the iPhone 15.\nThe iPhone 14, two months later\nThe iPhone 14 certainly impressed me when I initially reviewed it. Fast-forward a couple of months since then, and that positive impression hasn\u2019t changed. The iPhone 14 still isn\u2019t a particularly exciting or eye-catching iPhone, but it continues to be my go-to recommendation for folks who \u201cjust want an iPhone.\u201d\nWhile I\u2019ve since switched to an iPhone 14 Pro Max, my partner has been daily driving the base iPhone 14 since release \u2014 and it\u2019s performed flawlessly. The screen still looks great, performance from the A15 chip offers little to complain about, and the battery is just as reliable as ever. The cameras also continue to deliver, effortlessly churning out social media-ready photos with just a press of the shutter button. Even stacked side-by-side with the iPhone 14 Pro, the iPhone 14\u2019s camera holds its own.\nBut my gripes with the iPhone 14 also remain. Not having a 90Hz or 120Hz display is still annoying, especially when I\u2019m regularly looking at other phones with those faster refresh rates. And if you don\u2019t care about its subtle camera upgrades or new safety features, it\u2019s difficult to not just recommend the cheaper iPhone 13.\nIf anything, the last couple of months have made me more excited about what the iPhone 15 could look like. It\u2019s all but confirmed that Apple is switching to USB-C in 2023, there\u2019s the possibility of a design refresh, and- even though the Dynamic Island hasn\u2019t reached its full potential yet, I still want it on all iPhones across the board next year.\nUltimately, my take on the iPhone 14 in December 2022 is largely the same as it was in October. If you want the newest iPhone and don\u2019t want to spend an absurd amount of cash, it\u2019s a killer all-around package you\u2019ll find little to complain about. But the iPhone 13 is 90% as good for (at least) $100 less, and the potential for the iPhone 15 is exciting. It is a great iPhone option, but it\u2019s not your only iPhone option.\niPhone 14 price and availability\nThe iPhone 14 is available for purchase now with a starting price of $799. That $799 price gets you 128GB of internal storage and should be plenty for most people. If you need more room, 256GB and 512GB options are available for $899 and $1099, respectively.\nWhile Apple\u2019s promotional offers aren\u2019t the best around, it is still possible to save some cash on your purchase. Buying direct from Apple lets you trade in your old phone to get a credit between $40 and $720. Additionally, paying for the iPhone 14 with your Apple Card gets you 3% cashback with Apple\u2019s Daily Cash program.\nThe iPhone 14 is a great upgrade, if you need it\nThat\u2019s the iPhone 14. Its cameras are nicer, it\u2019s slightly better with demanding games, and it has a couple of impressive safety features that you\u2019ll (hopefully) never have to use. But they\u2019re there just in case.\nI totally understand why some people have dismissed the iPhone 14 as an \u2018iPhone 13S\u2019 and as a device you should ignore. But it\u2019s the last part I disagree with. If you already have an iPhone 13 and don\u2019t see any reason to upgrade, that\u2019s probably the right call.\nBut if you have an iPhone XR, iPhone 11, or even the iPhone 12, the iPhone 14 is a phone I\u2019m more than happy to recommend. If you don\u2019t care about the Dynamic Island, 120Hz refresh rates, or a telephoto camera, the iPhone 14 is hands-down the best iPhone you can buy today. Even if it\u2019s a little boring."

      "text": "The iPhone 17 series is set to be one of 2025\u2019s biggest launch events, as Apple introduces its answer to the Samsung Galaxy S25 and Google Pixel 10 ranges.\nIt\u2019s already been a significant year for iPhone, thanks to the unexpected arrival of the iPhone 16e and the biggest overhaul to iOS in more than a decade with iOS 26, but Apple isn\u2019t done just yet.\nThis year, we expect the iPhone 17 series to arrive in September, and it\u2019s anticipated to include iPhone Air model for the first time.\nSo here\u2019s everything we know so far about the iPhone 17 series from the multitude of leaks, rumors and speculation from across the web.\nLatest iPhone 17 news\n- August 13: The iPhone 17 Pro price might increase by $50\n- August 12: iPhone 17 Air could be as powerful as the 17 Pro, but with a catch\n- August 5: Mark your calendar, this could be the iPhone 17 launch date\n- August 5: How will Apple deliver solid iPhone 17 Air battery life if the battery is this thin?\n- July 27: iPhone 17 Pro could get unexpectedly huge camera upgrades\niPhone 17: release date rumors\nA recent iPhone 17 launch date leak points towards the next Apple event taking place on September 9.\nThe report goes on to predict an iPhone 17 release date of September 19, with pre-orders tipped to open on September 12.\nLet\u2019s look at Apple\u2019s historical track record when it comes to some of the recent iPhone releases.\n| iPhone 17 (2025) \u2013 rumored | Rumored launch date: Tuesday 9 September Rumored release date: Friday 19 September |\n| iPhone 16 (2024) | Launch date: Monday 9 September Release date: Friday 20 September |\n| iPhone 15 (2023) | Launch date: Tuesday 12 September Release date: Friday 22 September |\n| iPhone 14 (2022) | Launch date: Wednesday 7 September Release date: Friday 16 September |\n| iPhone 13 (2021) | Launch date: Tuesday 14 September Release date: Friday 24 September |\nUnless there\u2019s another anomaly like the iPhone 12\u2019s delayed October 2020 release due to the COVID pandemic, we can expect to see the iPhone 17 lineup revealed sometime in September 2025.\niPhone 17: price rumors\nThe economical uncertainly of 2025, with rising tariffs and complex geo-political situations, have led to reports suggesting Apple could raise iPhone prices for the first time since the iPhone 12.\nOne rumor suggests Apple will increase the price of the base iPhone 17 Pro by $50 over the iPhone 16 Pro\u2019s launch price \u2013 but to offset the increase it\u2019ll double storage to 256GB.\nThere\u2019s been no word from Apple on whether we can expect iPhone 17 price increases. If Apple is to keep prices the same as last year, the base iPhone 17 would start at $799, the iPhone 17 Pro at $999, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max at $1,199.\nThe highly anticipated, super-slim iPhone 17 Air (more on this shortly) is being tipped to launch at roughly $900.\nHow many iPhone 17 models will there be?\nApple is expected to keep rolling with the four-handset line-up we\u2019ve seen in recent years, but in 2025 there\u2019s a new model which is poised to replace one of the incumbents.\nThere are suggestions Apple will replace the \u2018Plus\u2019 model with the Air, to keep the range at four devices. As we noted in our iPhone 16 Plus review, the larger size of the entry level iPhone finds itself in a complicated position where it makes it difficult to recommend.\nIf Apple was to ditch any of the line-up to make room for the iPhone Air, the Plus makes the most sense.\nExpected iPhone 17 series line-up\n- iPhone 17\n- iPhone 17 Pro\n- iPhone 17 Pro Max\n- iPhone 17 Air\niPhone 17: design\nFrom the rumors we\u2019ve seen so far, it looks like the iPhone 17 lineup could see significant design changes from the current iPhone 16 family.\nOne of the bigger changes we may see this year is the possibility of Apple returning to a curved-edge design rather than the flat edges that have been around since 2020. This would harken back to the first few iPhone iterations before Apple switched to flat edges, and then alternated back again.\nThis change may apply to all models of the iPhone 17, or maybe only the base models or only the Pro models.\nBut the biggest visual change could be to the rear camera arrays on all handsets, with early renders pointing towards my larger bumps which span the entire width of the devices.\niPhone 17\nConsidering that Apple just tweaked the design of the iPhone 16, it\u2019s unlikely that we will see any major revamp for the base model iPhone 17.\nRumors have suggested that Apple may actually slightly increase the size of the base model iPhone 17 to 6.3 inches (up from 6.1 inches), which would be the same size as the iPhone 16 Pro.\nAside from that, though, there hasn\u2019t been much information about the base model\u2019s design changes. Some mock-ups (like the one above), suggest we\u2019ll see a new camera design, but it\u2019s too early to tell at this point.\niPhone 17 Pro / Pro Max\nWhile the iPhone 16 Pro models maintained a familiar design reminiscent of previous years, the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are poised for substantial changes that could redefine their appeal.\nInitially, there were rumors suggesting that Apple might abandon titanium in favor of an aluminum frame for the iPhone 17 Pro models. However, a recent report from December suggests that Apple plans to continue utilizing titanium for these devices.\nThis situation is rife with speculation, and we can anticipate a wave of conflicting reports leading up to the official launch. At this point, both materials remain viable options, although we tend to believe that titanium will make the final cut, given its premium qualities.\nThe design of the back glass could also see alterations, shifting from a fully glass surface to a combination of aluminum and glass. Industry rumors propose that the upper half of the back panel could feature aluminum, while the bottom segment retains the glass finish necessary for wireless charging functionality.\nThe incorporation of aluminum would not only enhance the device\u2019s aesthetics but also provide greater durability against accidental drops, thus improving overall user experience.\nIn terms of camera design, the iPhone 16 Pro models were underwhelming due to minimal changes in this area. However, the iPhone 17 Pro is rumored to introduce significant upgrades.\nApple may eliminate the traditional square camera module in favor of a sleek rectangular camera bar crafted from aluminum. This design choice mirrors the approach taken by Google, indicating a trend towards more streamlined camera aesthetics.\nAnother intriguing possibility for the iPhone 17 Pro Max is the introduction of a smaller Dynamic Island. This potential modification stems from the implementation of a new \u201cmeta-lens\u201d for Face ID, which could allow for a more compact design and therefore less spatial demand on the device.\nFurthermore, there are whispers about offering brighter, more saturated color options for the iPhone 17 Pro models, including striking shades like dark green, teal, and classic green.\nThis information has been attributed to leaker Majin Bu, although it\u2019s wise to approach these claims with some skepticism, as this particular leaker has had a mixed record when it comes to the accuracy of past rumors.\nA rumor suggests the iPhone 17 Pro series could be offered in a color that was last seen on the MacBook Air.\niPhone 17 Air\nThe most exciting device of the iPhone 17 line-up could be one which is brand new to Apple. According to rumors, Apple will introduce a significantly slimmer model dubbed the iPhone 17 Air.\nThe iPhone 17 Air is likely to feature only a single-lens rear camera. Regarding the placement of the rear camera, reports indicate that it may adopt a vertical layout in the top-left corner like the iPhone 16 or switch to a large, centered camera bump on the back.\nReports suggest it will be 25% thinner than the iPhone 16 Pro. This thinness would be achieved by Apple using its in-house modem to replace the Qualcomm modems it previously utilized. However, a significantly thinner chassis might leave limited room for the battery, which is an important consideration.\nThere may not be enough space on the bottom edge for a speaker, so the iPhone 17 Air may only have one speaker at the top. The frame will consist of titanium and aluminum, but with a higher proportion of aluminum than titanium compared to the current Pro models.\niPhone 17: display\nThe iPhone 17 Pro handsets might boast the toughest screens Apple has ever put on a phone, with a report pointing towards a less reflective, more scratch-resistant display.\nMeanwhile, Apple could also address complaints about the base model iPhone, even the iPhone 16, still using a display with only a 60Hz refresh rate. That may be changing with the iPhone 17 series.\nAccording to industry sources, Apple may use LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) displays across the iPhone 17 lineup. Yes, that includes the base model and the Air variant. LTPO technology allows an OLED screen to have a dynamic refresh rate while using less power. With this in mind, all iPhone 17 models could have the 120Hz ProMotion always-on display.\nSeveral industry insiders corroborated the report that all iPhone 17 models will get a 120Hz display as of the end of last year.\nAnother big change we may see is an anti-reflective layer on the glass, which would help reduce glare and make it easier to see outdoors. This coating could also make the screen more resistant to scratches than the current Ceramic Shield.\nAs we mentioned previously, the base model iPhone 17 could get a bump in size to a 6.3-inch LTPO OLED display. The iPhone 17 Air may be 6.6 inches, while the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max should remain 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches, respectively.\niPhone 17: power and connectivity\nApple consistently enhances its iPhone lineup each year by introducing faster and more efficient processors, and the iPhone 17 series will be no exception.\nThe A19 chips anticipated for the iPhone 17 are said to be built using an upgraded 3nm manufacturing process. If accurate, this should result in a modest increase in performance and power efficiency.\nIt\u2019s expected Apple will offer two variants of the chip, with standard A19 powering the base iPhone 17, and a beefier A19 Pro could be found in the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max.\nThere\u2019s some confusion around the chipset that\u2019ll be found in the iPhone 17 Air, with earlier rumors suggesting it\u2019ll get the A19. A more recent report points towards it benefitting from the A19 Pro, albeit with one less GPU core than the chip destined for the Pro models.\nThe iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air are anticipated to have 8GB of RAM, while there are mixed reports about the Pro models. One rumor suggests both Pro models will carry 12GB of RAM, while another claims only the Pro Max will feature 12GB, with the standard Pro model also getting 8GB.\nWith the introduction of the iPhone 16e, Apple started moving away from Qualcomm by developing in-house modems.\nThis transition is set to unfold over the next three years, meaning at least one of the iPhone 17 models may incorporate Apple\u2019s proprietary 5G modem, while the others may continue to rely on Qualcomm\u2019s technology.\niPhone 17: cameras\nThe upcoming iPhone 17 lineup is set to offer substantial advancements in its camera technology, a development that is sure to excite both enthusiasts and professional photographers alike.\nEvery model in the iPhone 17 series is expected to feature a significantly enhanced front-facing selfie camera, boasting an impressive 24MP resolution compared to the previous 12MP. This upgrade in megapixels promises to deliver sharper details and more vibrant, clearer selfies, thereby enhancing the overall photography experience.\nHowever, there may still be some notable discrepancies in camera features between the Pro models. Reports indicate that only the iPhone 17 Pro Max will be equipped with a suite of high-performance cameras, including a 48MP primary camera, a 48MP ultrawide camera, and a 48MP telephoto camera.\nIn contrast, the smaller iPhone 17 Pro is rumored to retain a 12MP telephoto lens. Nonetheless, it\u2019s wise to approach this information skeptically, as alternative reports suggest that both Pro variants may come equipped with a 48MP telephoto lens.\nRegardless of the final configuration, both Pro models could get an upgrade in the zoom department. Rumors suggest Apple will up the optical zoom capabilities of its Pro phones from 5x to 8x.\nAdditional discussions have surfaced regarding a potential redesign of the camera bump, reminiscent of the camera bar found in the Google Pixel 9 series.\nThe slimmer variant will feature a singular yet powerful 48MP camera, promising to deliver high-quality images in a more compact form.\nMoreover, rumors suggest that at least one model in the iPhone 17 lineup may incorporate a mechanical aperture system, although the specific model remains uncertain. This innovative feature would empower users to adjust the aperture size, thus controlling the light entering the lens. iPhones utilize a fixed aperture system; adding a variable aperture would enable photographers to create images with a shallower depth of field, enhancing artistic expression in their work.\niPhone 17: battery life\nThe upgraded manufacturing process for the A19 chip is set to enhance both performance and power efficiency significantly. Apple typically does not opt for major increases in battery capacity with its new releases; however, users can anticipate notable improvements in battery life due to the A19 processor\u2019s enhanced power efficiency.\nEven if the battery capacity remains similar to that of the current generation, the optimized performance of the chip should lead to a more efficient energy usage, allowing for extended usage times between charges.\nThere is a question mark hanging over the iPhone 17 Air battery life though, with the super-slim device tipped to have a battery which is just 2.49mm thick.\nAdditionally, there\u2019s encouraging news for iPhone 17 users who may need to replace their batteries in the future. Apple has implemented a new type of adhesive that can be easily loosened using a low-voltage electrical current.\nThis technology, which has already been used in the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models, offers a significant advantage over previous adhesives, particularly in the Pro models, which lacked this feature.\nIt simplifies the battery replacement process, making it more accessible for users. If Apple adopts this method across the entire iPhone 17 lineup, it will alleviate much of the frustration associated with battery replacements, allowing users to extend the life of their devices without the need for extensive repairs or professional assistance."
