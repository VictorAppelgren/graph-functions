  "description": "One single customer alone accounts for over 20% of sales",
  "content": "\u2022 Nvidia\u2019s financial stability depends heavily on three powerful, unnamed customers\n\u2022 Elon Musk, OpenAI, and Meta are the likely three\n\nNvidia\u2019s latest earnings report for 2025 has drawn attention not only for breaking sales records once again, but also for revealing a risk hidden beneath the numbers.\n\nThe company reported $46 billion in its Q2 2026 quarterly revenue, with its Data Center division contributing $21.9 billion.\n\nBut what really stands out is that \u201cnearly 53%\u201d of this income came from just three customers. The report detailed $9.5 billion from Customer A, $6.6 billion from Customer B, and $5.7 billion from Customer C.\n\nWhile this concentration of sales demonstrates strong relationships with powerful buyers, it also suggests a structural vulnerability in Nvidia\u2019s financial base.\n\nNvidia has not confirmed the identities of these clients, but industry observers have made informed guesses.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s xAI is often mentioned, particularly after a record-setting installation of 100,000 Nvidia H200 GPUs in just 19 days, a task CEO Jensen Huang said normally requires four years.\n\nMusk\u2019s stated ambition of running 50 million H100-equivalent GPUs over five years further strengthens the speculation.\n\nAnother possible contender is the OpenAI and Oracle partnership, which announced plans for a Stargate data center featuring more than two million AI chips.\n\nMeta has also been expanding aggressively, with \u201cseveral multi-GW clusters\u201d reportedly the size of Manhattan, adding more weight to the theory.\n\nThese projects represent demand levels far beyond typical enterprise needs, closer to what one would expect when equipping a supercharged workstation or deploying an entire fleet of machines designed with the best CPU available.\n\nIt may seem reassuring to have such massive contracts locked in, but the concentration risk is difficult to ignore.\n\nIf one of these entities were to pivot toward in-house chip design, switch to a competitor like AMD, or encounter operational issues, Nvidia would face a sudden financial hole.\n\nCustomer A alone accounts for more than 20% of quarterly sales. The dependence is stark, and investors cannot ignore how fragile such reliance might become.\n\nNvidia\u2019s dominance in GPUs remains clear, but market history shows that leaders tied too closely to a few clients can face serious disruption.\n\nGeopolitics adds another layer of uncertainty - Nvidia has already absorbed a $5.5 billion hit following restrictions on its H20 chip, compounded when Chinese firms were directed to halt purchases after an initial reopening of sales.\n\nThese events highlight how the company\u2019s market position can be influenced by decisions far outside the scope of chip design or supply chain management.\n\nAs of today, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs remain unrivaled, but the underlying question persists: can the company maintain its momentum if its mystery trio ever decides to walk away?\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 Check out the best 3D modeling software for 3D printing and more\n\u2022 We've rounded up the best portable monitors available now\n\u2022 SMBs want to use tech more in order to grow - but costs are proving a big barrier",

      "text": "More than 50% of Nvidia\u2019s data center revenue comes from three customers \u2014 $21.9 billion in sales recorded from the unnamed companies\nHow would you feel if just three customers made up nearly half of your sales?\nNvidia just released its second-quarter earnings for 2025, which showed the company breaking its sales records. This is great news for the AI GPU giant and its investors, but the quarterly report also showed a risk that the company is taking. Business publication Sherwood noted that nearly 53% of the reported revenue for the Green Team's Data Center division comes from just three unnamed customers, totaling about $21.9 billion in sales. This is broken down to $9.5 billion from Customer A, $6.6 billion from Customer B, and $5.7 billion from Customer C.\nThis might not sound like a problem \u2014 after all, why complain if three different entities are handing you piles and piles of money \u2014 but concentrating the majority of your sales to just a handful of clients could cause a sudden, unexpected issue. For example, the company\u2019s entire second-quarter revenue is around $46 billion, which means that Customer A makes up more than 20% of its sales. If this company were to suddenly vanish (say it decided to build its own chips, go with AMD, or a scandal forces it to cease operations), then it would have a massive impact on Nvidia\u2019s cash flow and operations.\nThese scenarios are unlikely to happen soon, though, as investors are still bullish about AI tech, and Nvidia\u2019s competitors are still envious of the tech stack that the Green Team can offer. Still, resting the future of your company (especially one so big) on a narrow base will likely keep some executives awake at night.\nWho are these heavy hitting clients?\nThe company did not name which institutions were its biggest clients, but we can take a guess based on the plans and announcements that several big tech companies have made. One of the first that comes to mind is Elon Musk and xAI. The billionaire has previously broken data center records, setting up 100,000 Nvidia H200 GPUs in a record 19 days last year \u2014 something that usually takes four years to finish, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. But more than that, Musk has dreams of running 50 million H100-equivalent GPUs in the next five years.\nOpenAI and Oracle also recently signed a deal to build a Stargate data center with over 2 million AI chips \u2014 estimated to be equivalent to 5GW spread across 20 different data centers. Meta is also another big Nvidia customer that has recently been in the news, with Zuckerberg putting up data centers housed in tents and announcing plans for \u2018several multi-GW clusters\u2019, some of which are reportedly as large as Manhattan.\nEven though Nvidia is facing issues with its China sales, first when President Donald Trump banned its H20 chip \u2014 resulting in a $5.5 billion write-off \u2014 and second, when Beijing instructed Chinese companies to stop buying the chips a few weeks after Trump reopened the H20 taps to China once again, these numbers could mean that the company is still relatively safe from ruin, even if it loses complete access to the East Asian country. So, Nvidia\u2019s sales to these three companies are probably the reason why Huang can spend his time shuttling between Beijing and Washington, with his company seemingly being used as a political tool by both sides of the ongoing trade war.\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

We\u2019d get RFQs from them for things we\u2019d no-quote others on, and they\u2019d say that if we didn\u2019t bid we might not be asked to bid on other things\u2026 then if we quoted high because we didn\u2019t wanna do it, they\u2019d say we need to take garbage margins on that one, because if we didn\u2019t we might not be asked to bid on parts we could make better margins on. When their engineers came to visit they saw the rules about escorts being required and no pictures allowed as being for other people. RMAs were basically non-negotiable with them.\nIf I were Nvidia, I wouldn\u2019t fear someone vanishing or switching to in-house/AMD out of the blue so much as I\u2019d worry about them becoming incredibly difficult and low margin, because they know they\u2019re too big to fire as a client. Even if margins are bad, a bad margin on $22B is still a lot of money, and investors would freak out if sales dropped by 50%, regardless of why. -\nA Stoner They are add in board partners who nvidia sells chips to and who make the final product that is shipped to hundreds of thousands of other buyers. I saw this story on X and there is additional information that indicates these are not direct customers, like Elon Musk and so forth.Reply -\nbit_user Reply\nCertainly not gaming GPUs, since that's less than 10% of Nvidia's revenue. So, I guess some of them could be server manufacturers, like Dell or Supermicro, or systems integrators.A Stoner said:They are add in board partners who nvidia sells chips to and who make the final product that is shipped to hundreds of thousands of other buyers.\nA trustworthy source, if ever there was one!A Stoner said:I saw this story on X\n/s\nIs there good intel that all three fall in this category, though?A Stoner said:there is additional information that indicates these are not direct customers, like Elon Musk and so forth. -\njp7189 I love AI and all, but i wouldn't cry if Nvidia went back to focusing on Graphics Processing Units.Reply -\nAmdlova Reply\nIt's easy they skip graphics entirely... just look how messy is the new 50xx series...jp7189 said:I love AI and all, but i wouldn't cry if Nvidia went back to focusing on Graphics Processing Units. -\nMr Majestyk Reply\nPlenty of actually useful uses of AI in science, engineering , medicine, geology, historical restoration, etc. All these trillions aren't just being spent for copilot and ChatGPT.

AI has been used in all those other areas for about a decade and didn't require nearly so much compute horsepower or capital expenditures. Those early models (CNNs, most of them) were comparatively small and cheap to train, but even cheaper to inference.Mr Majestyk said:Plenty of actually useful uses of AI in science, engineering , medicine, geology, historical restoration, etc. All these trillions aren't just being spent for copilot and ChatGPT.\nYeah, if Nvidia had to return to relying on the gaming market to pay the bills, its collapse would make Intel's woes look like sunshine and rainbows, by comparison. By now, the majority of Nvidia's staff are focused on AI, in one way or another, with a lot of them being quite specialized in it.Mr Majestyk said:The lgaming market is ridiculously small to sustain Nvidia. -\nbit_user Reply\nWith China dragging its feet on H20 adoption and other customers facing challenges even figuring out how to power the GPUs they keep buying, I think demand will hit a speed bump, fairly soon. It'll be interesting to see how financial markets react to that and if it might cascade through to companies being forced to rationalize their AI investments.American2021 said:The data center business made up 88% of Nvidia\u2019s overall revenue in the second quarter of 2025.

Needless to say, he knows computers inside and out, and he has personally tested (and retested) all of the graphics cards on this page, having reviewed more than 35 graphics cards for TechRadar in his five years with the site. He has validated all of the results you'll find here in this guide, backed up by hundreds of hours of testing in the TechRadar computer lab over the last three years.\nThe best graphics card in 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBelow, you'll find detailed write-ups for each of the best graphics card picks on this list. I've extensively tested each of them and have the gaming and other performance data you need to make the right choice for your needs and budget.\nThe best graphics card overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the best value proposition for a high-end graphics card\nThe AMD RX 9070 XT punches way above its price point with outstanding performance at 4K and 1440p.\n\u2705 You don't want to pay inflated prices for an Nvidia GPU\nPrice inflation wrecking the market for Nvidia GPUs right now, but the RX 9070 XT offers a better value proposition than Nvidia's latest RTX offerings.\n\u274c You're on a tight budget\nIf you don't have a lot of money to spend, this card is likely more than you need.\n\u274c You need strong creative or AI performance\nWhile AMD is getting better at creative and AI workloads, it still lags far behind Nvidia's competing offerings.\nI spent about two weeks testing the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT for my review of AMD's latest flagship GPU, and it\u2019s without question one of the best gaming GPUs I\u2019ve ever used.\nWith performance that nearly matches the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080\u2014at half the launch price\u2014it\u2019s an unbeatable deal. AMD\u2019s always had fewer supply issues and less scalping compared to Nvidia, so I expect the RX 9070 XT to remain accessible at around its $599 MSRP, which should be a huge relief for anyone weary of overpriced, understocked cards.\nIn my testing, I saw power draws of up to 309W, which is high, but given the performance level for this card, I won't say it's out of bounds. You'll need to make sure that your case can fit a triple-fan card and supply it with enough power, so it might not be ideal for small form factor builds. It also won\u2019t blow you away with creative or AI tasks if my test results are any indication, but for pure gaming, it's fantastic.\nIn my testing, the RX 9070 XT got within 7% of the RTX 4080 and beat out every single last-gen AMD card, delivering high frame rates in some very demanding games, and providing a smooth gaming experience overall, even at 4K in many cases. Its fantastic value, especially in a graphics card generation that is largely lacking in excellent price-for-performance offers, makes this not only a massive breath of fresh air for the market but a new GPU offering that any PC gaming fan should be excited about.\nRead the full AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT review\nAlso consider\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti\nWhile slightly more expensive, the RTX 5070 Ti is a better all-around performer, making it worth the extra money, especially if you're keen to do more than game on it.\nRead our in-depth Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti vs RX 9070 XT analysis\nAMD Radeon RX 9070\nWhile not as powerful, the Radeon RX 9070 is still a fantastic 1440p performer at a lower price point than its beefier sibling.\nRead our in-depth AMD RX 9070 XT vs RX 9070 analysis\nThe best budget graphics card\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a great graphics card on a budget. The Intel Arc B580 is a steal at MSRP. No other card at $250 is going to be this good at 1440p gaming.\n\u2705 You're looking for great gaming performance. Speaking of performance, the gaming chops on the Arc B580 aren't just a value proposition. You won't be sacrificing performance with this card.\n\u274c You're looking for a budget creative GPU. While the B580 has some promise as a video editing card, if you're looking for a GPU for creative work, Nvidia cards are the better bet.\n\u274c You want a cheap GPU for AI workloads. Like its creative prowess, the Intel Arc B580 is decent enough for dedicated AI workloads, but can't hold a candle to competing Nvidia cards.\nThe Intel Arc B580 was the biggest GPU surprise of 2024 when it launched last December, greatly impressing me with its phenomenal 1440p gaming performance in my tests for under $250/\u00a3250/AU$450 at MSRP, something AMD and Nvidia have failed to do for two generations now.\nWhat's more, any issues that Intel's previous Arc Alchemist GPUs suffered from seemed to have been ironed out with this latest release, earning a rare 5-star review from me in my review.\nWhile the card has its drawbacks (its ray tracing performance lags behind Nvidia's and it's not the best creative GPU out there for the money, for example), this is strictly a GPU for gamers, and considering how long it's been since PC gamers have had a compelling graphics card at this price point, it's simply in a class of its own.\nThat said, if you want the absolute best graphics card performance at 1440p or 1080p, there are better cards for that, like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. But those other cards are substantially more expensive, and they just don't offer a good enough reason to buy them when the Arc B580 is right there, offering nearly equal performance on average and costing 10%-40% less than its competition.\nSo if you're looking for the best budget graphics card but don't want to sacrifice performance, this card is exactly what you are looking for.\nRead the full Intel Arc B580 review\nAlso consider\nIntel Arc B570\nIf all you're looking for is 1080p gaming on the cheap, the Arc B570 can offer you solid 1080p gameplay at a much lower price, though it won't be able to offer you much else than that.\nRead our in-depth Intel Arc B580 vs B570 analysis\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4060\nNvidia's cheapest graphics card on the market isn't a slouch when it comes to performance, especially at 1080p, with some good 1440p performance when using reasonable settings.\nRead our in-depth Intel Arc B580 vs Nvidia RTX 4060 analysis\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want the very best performance: While the performance of the RTX 5070 Ti is fantastic, there are better (though more expensive) graphics cards you can buy to maximum performance.\n\u274c You're on a tight budget: While the MSRP on this card is great for an enthusiast-grade GPU, it's still very expensive for most buyers.\n\u274c You don't plan on gaming at 4K: If all you're looking to do is game at 1440p, this card is likely going to be overkill, especially with more affordable 1440p GPUs on the market.\n\u2705 You want the perfect balance of 4K performance and price: Pretty much across the board, this card delivers outstanding performance no matter the workload for less than other premium GPUs.\n\u2705 You want fantastic creative performance on the cheap: For creative professionals, a high-quality GPU can be a very expensive proposition, but this card brings solid 3D, video, and raster performance on a budget.\n\u2705 You want the latest Nvidia technology: DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation is a fantastic way to max out 4K gaming monitors.\nI found the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to offer the best balance of performance and price across all categories that I've seen over the last two generations of Nvidia GPUs, and it's not even really close in most cases.\nMy test results found it gives crisp, fluid 4K gaming performance without much in the way of settings compromise in just about every game. Meanwhile, content creators or AI enthusiasts who are looking for an Nvidia GPU that can deliver top-tier performance without the kind of substantial investment normally required for a workstation GPU.\nOf course, this all comes with a massive caveat, which is that you're able to find this card at MSRP. Without a Founders Edition card directly from Nvidia, pricing is ultimately in the hands of third-party partners, so there's no guarantee that you'll ever be able to find this card at the price Nvidia set for it. So depending on the price you find for this card, your value proposition may change accordingly, and other cards on this list might be better options.\nObjectively speaking, however, just about every other card on this list faces the same pricing pressures that the RTX 5070 Ti does, and so on balance this card is almost certainly going to offer you the best performance for your money no matter what you're looking to use it for.\nIf you want it for your gaming rig, you can game at close to 90 fps on average at 4K with a fps floor of 65, which is about as good as you could want for a premium GPU, especially for its price.\nCreative pros who need a dedicated GPU for 3D modeling or video editing work will especially like this card, as it comes close to matching some of the best graphics cards for creatives of the last generation, and someone upgrading from an RTX 3090 will see a big performance boost over what they have now.\nIf the price of Nvidia's RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 are too high for your liking but you want enthusiast-grade performance, the RTX 5070 Ti is exactly the card you're looking for.\nRead the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti review\nAlso consider\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5080\nWhile more expensive, this is the best high-end, enthusiast-grade GPU available for under a grand, making it a more premium alternative to the RTX 5070 Ti.\nRead our in-depth Nvidia RTX 5080 vs RTX 5070 Ti analysis\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 XT\nWhile the RTX 5070 Ti has better performance than the RX 9070 XT, it's a very close fight between the two, and the RX 9070 XT is a good bit cheaper.\nRead our in-depth Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti vs RX 9070 XT analysis\nThe best gaming graphics card\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want fantastic 4K gaming performance: The RTX 5080 has some of the best 4K gaming performance you're going to find anywhere, even before factoring in DLSS 4 MFG.\n\u2705You want very strong creative performance on the cheap: Nvidia's GPUs are miles ahead of the competition when it comes to creative workloads, and the RTX 5080 delivers fantastic performance for the price.\n\u274c You have anything better than an RTX 4080: The RTX 5080 isn't a huge improvement over the RTX 4080 and RTX 4080 Super, so if you have those cards, there's not much reason to upgrade.\n\u274c You're on a tight-ish budget: While not as pricey as the RTX 4080, RTX 4090, or RTX 5090, this is still a very expensive graphics card, even before factoring in price inflation by third-party sellers.\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 is the third most powerful GPU you can buy at a price that won't force you to take out a small bank loan to buy, even though which version of the card you buy can make all the difference in terms of whether you'll be able to afford it.\nThis card is one of the most sought-after on the market, so it's subject to ongoing stock issues and price inflation which makes its value proposition for any given buyer a moving target.\nThis is especially true once you consider that the gen-on-gen uplift of this card over the RTX 4080 and RTX 4080 Super is only about 8-13% according to my testing, so if you can find the RTX 4080 and RTX 4080 Super for less than an RTX 5080, those cards might be a better value depending on their price.\nIt also goes without saying that anyone with an RTX 4080 or RTX 4080 Super should not get this card, as you won't see much benefit from it other than Multi-Frame Generation with DLSS 4, which is not worth spending this kind of money on.\nFor everyone else, though, especially those coming from the RTX 30 series or pretty much any AMD card other than the RX 7900 XTX, the RTX 5080 will blow you away\u2014assuming you can find it in stock, that is.\nRead the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 review\nAlso Consider\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti\nIf the RTX 5080 is too expensive for you, the RTX 5070 Ti offers a solid amount of performance relative to the RTX 5080 at a slightly lower price.\nRead our in-depth Nvidia RTX 5080 vs RTX 5070 Ti analysis\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super\nThe RTX 5080 is only about 8-13% faster than the RTX 4080 Super, so if you can get the RTX 4080 Super for less than the RTX 5080, it might be a much better value.\nRead our full RTX 5080 vs RTX 4080 Super analysis\nThe best graphics card for creatives\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the best of the best: The RTX 5090's performance is in a class all its own, blowing away even the vaunted RTX 4090.\n\u2705 You do a lot of 3D modeling/rendering: The RTX 5090's 3D rendering performance is 30-40% faster than the RTX 4090, which is light years ahead of anything else, so this card is a 3D artist's dream.\n\u2705 You're spending someone else's money: If you don't have to pay for this thing, there's no reason not to splurge on the best performance available.\n\u274c You're not a creative or machine-learning professional: While the gaming prowess of this card is undeniable, it's honestly extreme overkill for 99% of gamers out there.\n\u274c You aren't flush with cash: Honestly, unless you're loaded to bear with fat stacks of cash, there are graphics cards out there that will get you phenomenal performance at a fraction of the price.\nIf you're looking for the best possible performance for your creative work\u2014and who isn't? Time is money, after all\u2014then this is really really the holy grail for creatives (not to mention AI professionals).\nWhether you're working with 3D modeling and rendering in a professional capacity, you're a video production professional, or you're an AI researcher, Nvidia's GPUs have long been the standard for commercial and academic use, but the RTX 5090 is in a whole other league.\nWith a massive 33% increase in multiprocessors, including industry mainstay CUDA and Tensor cores, and 32GB VRAM that is faster than the last-gen's best, the RTX 4090, which 'only' had 24GB VRAM.\nFor the gamers and enthusiasts out there who are determined to flex on their friends with this card, my testing found it was nothing short of overkill for every game I tested it with. It's the only graphics card that's truly capable of handling native 8K gaming, thanks to its massive VRAM pool and enormous memory interface, but it's also the only graphics card I've tested where you can get actually playable native 4K gaming with ray tracing maxed out.\nOf course, all this performance isn't cheap, and you could buy a used car with a year or two of life in it for the same price as this card's MSRP, and there's no way you're ever going to find it at MSRP. What's more, its frankly scandalous power consumption tops out around 575W, so expect a hefty power bill to go along with this already super-premium GPU.\nRead the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 review\nAlso consider\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090\nIf you're looking at the RTX 5090, then there's really only one alternative, and that's the RTX 4090. While not as powerful as the RTX 5090, it's still the second most powerful consumer graphics card in the world.\nRead our in-depth Nvidia RTX 5090 vs RTX 4090 analysis\nThe best 1440p graphics card\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705You want fantastic midrange performance: Given the strength of this card in all categories, on balance, it's one of the best graphics cards you're going to find in the midrange.\n\u2705You want very strong ray tracing performance: With the maturity of its ray tracing cores, the RTX 4070 Super is the best ray tracing GPU in the midrange, for sure.\n\u2705You want some creative performance as well: With its strong CUDA backbone, the RTX 4070 Super is a great option for those looking to get into creative content work.\n\u274c You don't want to spend a fortune: Given the price of the competition, there are better graphics cards for your money than the RTX 4070 Super\n\u274c You don't care about ray tracing or compute performance: The strongest assets this card brings to the table are its ray tracing and tensor cores, but if you don't care about ray tracing or machine learning tasks, the RX 7900 GRE will offer a better overall gaming performance.\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super meets the high expectations I had for this card, offering compelling performance at the same price as its predecessor.\nThe Super outshines the base RTX 4070, offering more SMs for enhanced processing and a swifter base clock speed. However, its 12GB GDDR6X VRAM limits its 4K prowess, so for optimal 4K performance, the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5080 are a better bet.\nFor top-tier 1440p gaming, though, the RTX 4070 Super excels thanks to its robust specs, DLSS 3 with Frame Generation, and Nvidia Reflex technology.\nAnd while the RTX 4070 Super generally outperforms the RX 7800 XT, particularly in ray tracing, AMD holds the edge in 1440p gaming performance with the RX 9070.\nDespite stiff competition, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super still stands out as the best 1440p graphics card overall for those who want the most utility out of a midrange GPU, especially for anyone seeking a balance of gaming prowess, content creation capabilities, and sheer performance.\nRead the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super review\nAlso consider\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5070\nThe RTX 4070 Super's successor, the Nvidia RTX 5070, isn't any more powerful than the RTX 4070 Super, but it has a slightly cheaper MSRP and features advanced features like DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, so if you can find it for the same price or cheaper than the RTX 4070 Super, it's a good pick.\nRead our in-depth Nvidia RTX 5070 vs RTX 4070 Super analysis\nAMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE\nThe RX 7900 GRE is the perfect alternative to the RTX 4070 Super if all you care about is gaming, though it's not as good of an option if you need to do any creative or ML work.\nRead our in-depth RX 7900 GRE vs RTX 4070 Super analysis\nThe best 1080p graphics card\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want bargain-priced 1080p gaming: This graphics card can't do a lot of things, but one thing it's great at is playing 1080p games for a fraction of the price of its nearest competitors.\n\u2705You want good ray tracing performance for cheap: The main draw of this GPU is how dirt cheap it is relative to the market, and for that, the ray tracing on this card is better than it has any right to be at this price (though it's still not great, necessarily).\n\u274c You want to game at 1440p: Given the limited amount of VRAM, this GPU isn't really capable of 1440p gaming without some major compromises on visual quality.\n\u274c You want a budget creative card: If you're just putting your toes into the waters of creative work, whether it be 3D modeling, video editing, or the like, you should probably look at the RTX 4060 instead. This card won't give you what you need.\nThe Intel Arc B570 might not get as much attention as the Intel Arc B580, but if all you're looking for is dirt-cheap 1080p gameplay with some nice extras like ray tracing and hardware upscaling, you can't go wrong with the Arc B570.\nFor significantly less than competing 1080p cards like the AMD RX 7600 and Nvidia RTX 4060, you can get nearly the same level of performance while gaming at 1080p, and with hardware upscaling through Intel XeSS with Frame Generation, you can get frame rates we've simply never seen at this price point.\nOf course, it does come with some limitations. Its 10GB GDDR6 VRAM is great, but not quite enough to really handle 1440p gaming without some major compromises. Its creative performance is also pretty much non-existent beyond being able to encode AV1 video, which you might find useful if you're a streamer and you want a cheap setup to offload some video processing into.\nOtherwise, this is strictly a cheap 1080p gaming graphics card, and for what it is, it's about as good as you're going to find anywhere on the market right now.\nRead the full Intel Arc B570 review\nAlso Consider\nIntel Arc B580\nWhile not quite a 1080p graphics card thanks to its 12GB VRAM, this card is priced very close at MSRP to the B570, making it a better 'stretch' alternative if you have the money.\nRead our in-depth Intel Arc B580 vs B570 analysis\nThe best last-gen Nvidia graphics card\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want native 4K ray-traced gaming: This is one of the few cards that can consistently run full ray tracing at native 4K resolution.\n\u2705 You are a 3D graphics professional: If you work with major 3D rendering tools like Maya, Blender, and others, this is your graphics card.\n\u274c You're on a budget: This card is incredibly expensive, even on sale.\n\u274c You're concerned about power consumption: With a TGP of 450W, this card has a near-bottomless appetite for power.\nYes, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is expensive. It also requires a 16-pin connector or adapter that many people still don't have, and it is very, very big. But, the first release from Nvidia\u2019s new 4000-series is an absolute powerhouse that can tackle anything you need it to, making it a worthwhile pickup from the last gen if you can find it for cheap.\nIn my testing, I found it performed significantly better than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 with two to four times the performance in synthetic benchmarks and up to 100% improved framerates with some games. What\u2019s more, DLSS 3 is a game-changer in terms of gaming frame rates, and in games that support it, the RTX 4090 with Frame Generation turned on will absolutely push even the best gaming monitors to the limit of what they can do. Now that DLSS 4 is rolling out to the RTX 40 series, this is an even more powerful card than it was when I reviewed it in 2022.\nThat said, this is far more GPU than most people will probably ever need, and you have to really, really want this card, especially at the prices it is selling for right now. That said, if you can get it for a reasonable price, it's a solid pickup that you might not want to miss.\nRead the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 review\nAlso consider\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5090\nIf you're in the market for the best of the best, the RTX 5090 is the best there is, and while more expensive than the RTX 4090, it's certainly worth it.\nRead our in-depth Nvidia RTX 5090 vs RTX 4090 analysis\nThe best last-gen AMD graphics card\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want outstanding 4K gaming performance: Few games can challenge the RX 7900 XTX at native 4K, and FSR upscaling even makes fast ray-traced 4K gaming possible.\n\u2705 You want to future-proof your rig for fast 8K gaming: Thanks to its 24GB VRAM and DisplayPort 2.1 output, when 8K gaming finally does arrive in the next few years, this card has the hardware so it won't be completely out of its league.\n\u274c You want something for creative work: While the price tag might lead you to think this card can do anything, it really can't keep up with even midrange Nvidia cards in creative workloads like Blender.\n\u274c You're on a budget: While it is well-priced for a premium GPU, this card is not for those who are on tighter budgets.\nAsserting its dominance in the 4K gaming realm, the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX marks AMD's most exceptional offering in the premium category.\nReleased at the tail end of 2022, this powerhouse GPU is a couple of years old now, but it's still holding its own against current-gen cards like the RTX 5070 Ti. Especially when it comes to 4K gaming, there are few cards that can match the frame rates of the RX 7900 XTX.\nOutside of gaming though, things aren't as rosy for the best AMD graphics card of the last generation. Thanks to Nvidia's proprietary lock on the CUDA instruction set powering most 3D modeling software and AI tools like Pytorch (not to mention Nvidia's advanced Tensor cores), even more budget-friendly Nvidia cards are better for these workloads than AMD's last-gen flagship.\nThat said, if you're looking for a gaming dynamo that's capable of blazing-fast 4K gaming, this is definitely one of the best graphics cards you can buy and might even be more available than Nvidia's latest RTX 50 series GPUs.\nRead the full AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX review\nAlso Consider\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti\nFor less than the amount of money you'd pay for the RX 7900 XTX, you'd likely be able to pick up the RTX 5070 Ti, which offers very similar performance.\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5080\nFor the same price as the RX 7900 XTX, you can get the current-gen RTX 5080 from Nvidia, which has better performance on every level.\nMy top tips for buying a graphics card\nWhen shopping for the best graphics card for your needs and budget, the first thing you need to do is consider your monitor (or the monitor you plan to buy), as the resolution you're targeting matters quite a bit.\nFor 1080p, I recommend looking at GPUs with at least 8GB VRAM, like the AMD Radeon RX 7600 and Nvidia RTX 4060, but getting one with 10GB VRAM like the Intel Arc B570 is ideal.\nFor 1440p, I recommend GPUs with at least 12GB VRAM, like the Nvidia RTX 5070, AMD RX 9070, or Intel Arc B580. This will ensure high framerates at quad HD resolution, which is considered the sweet spot for PC gaming.\nFor 4K gaming, my testing shows that you'll need a minimum of 16GB VRAM in your GPU, preferably with a 256-bit memory bus to make sure that UHD textures are processed quickly so you can maintain a 60 FPS baseline for your games. This means you should be looking at cards like the Nvidia RTX 4080 Super, RTX 5080, AMD, RX 7900 XTX, and AMD RX 9070 XT, all of which are great picks for 4K gaming.\nFor creative and AI use, you're going to want to stick to the best Nvidia graphics card you can afford, as it will give you the level of performance professionals need.\nIf you need more in-depth advice on how to choose a graphics card appropriate for your needs, you can read my in-depth guide to how to choose the right graphics card.\nHow I tested the graphics cards on this list\nWhen it comes to the best graphics cards, it's essential that I test every GPU I review on an equal playing field. That's why I test graphics cards with a full suite of benchmark tests covering synthetic tests, creative performance, and a battery of around 7-10 games tested at different settings and across several resolutions, all on current drivers.\nI am also constantly retesting graphics cards I've already reviewed so I have the most up-to-date data as drivers are updated. I make sure that all of the cards are tested on the same hardware, which means the same processor, the same memory at the same speed, the same motherboard, and the same SSD.\nThat way, I can be sure that I'm measuring how the graphics card itself is performing relative to other cards.\nIf you want to know my testing process in greater detail, you can read more about how I test graphics cards for TechRadar in-depth.\nWhich graphics card has the best power efficiency?\nThere are a few ways to measure energy efficiency for a GPU, with the two most common being which draws the most power under load, and which gets the best performance per watt.\nWhile maximum power draw is very important (if your graphics card draws more power than your PSU can provide, your PC will crash without warning) since knowing its peak power consumption is essential to knowing whether you can effectively use the card with your PC build.\nBut if we're talking specifically about efficiency, there's value in knowing which graphics cards get the most performance at the lowest energy use.\nFor that, performance-per-watt is an excellent metric to look at, especially if you're concerned about your monthly power bill.\nThe best graphics card: FAQs\nWhich graphics card is best for gaming?\nGenerally speaking, the best graphics card for gaming is going to depend on several factors, but principally, your budget and monitor resolution will dictate the best card for gaming on your system.\nFor 4K gaming, the Nvidia RTX 5080 is as good as it gets without spending an absolute mint on the RTX 5090, while the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT is the best gaming graphics card from AMD, with the Intel Arc B580 offering an excellent budget-friendly alternative.\nFor 1080p, the Nvidia RTX 4060 is the way to go, while the AMD Radeon RX 7600 and Intel Arc B570 are also great alternatives.\nWhat is the most powerful graphics card?\nThe most powerful graphics card for gamers and creatives on the market right now is the RTX 5090. That's because it features a staggering 32GB GDDR7 memory pool with a 512-bit memory bus, along with a massive GPU die with more than 20,000 shader cores,\nIs a GTX or RTX graphics card better?\nAn RTX graphics card is much better than an older GTX model. Nvidia discontinued the GTX line when brought in the RTX 20 series a handful of years ago. RTX GPUs are capable of real-time ray tracing and can utilize the company's AI upscaling tech DLSS for increased framerates in more demanding games.\nWhat GPU can run 4K?\nAs a general rule, running a modern AAA game at native 4K\u2014that is, without using upscaling technology like DLSS or FSR\u2014your GPU will need at least 16GB VRAM.\nCards with 12GB VRAM can run games at 4K with upscaling technology and other graphics settings tweaks, but some cards will do better than others.\nCards with less than 12GB VRAM are not going to be able to play games at 4K reliably without considerable graphical sacrifices.\nToday's best graphics card deals\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.\nNamed by the CTA as a CES 2020 Media Trailblazer for his science and technology reporting, John specializes in all areas of computer science, including industry news, hardware reviews, PC gaming, as well as general science writing and the social impact of the tech industry.\nYou can find him online on Bluesky @johnloeffler.bsky.social"

      "text": "Best 3D modeling software of 2025\nBring your creations to life with the best 3D modeling software for 3D printing and more\nThe best 3D modeling software and apps smoothly powers through a range of professional-grade design tasks, from architecture and video game design to 3D printing.\nDepending on what you're creating, I find Autodesk 3ds Max to be the best 3D modeling software overall for professional film and game development, while Maya and Blender stand-out as top picks for animation (the latter is also completely free to use).\nMy team and I have tested a range of essential design tools where we compare performance, features, and workflows. These include the best VFX software, the best animation software, the best graphic design software.\nWant to bring your creations into the real world? We've also reviewed the best 3D printers around.\nBest 3D modeling software overall\n1. Autodesk 3ds Max\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAutodesk 3ds Max is our top pick for best 3D modeling software. And our emphasis here is on modeling, with 3DS Max especially popular with game developers, interior designers, and architects who need professional modeling, texturing, and meshing tools. For that reason, like Autodesk's Maya, Fusion360, and AutoCAD, it's good 3D printing software.\nStandard features include skeletons and inverse kinematics, cloth simulation, skinning and character controls for bipedal motion. If the software doesn\u2019t support the exact function or rendering mode you need, an extensive plugin system allows third-party modules to add this to 3DS Max. Some of these plugins are free, but we found the best ones are paid.\nFor modeling purposes, 3ds Max supports conventional polygon construction, NURBS and also patch surfaces. Images can be generated using a very wide range of rendering systems, including Renderman created by Pixar and mental ray.\nHowever, while we think 3ds Max is a feature-rich 3D creation software, packed with pro-level functionality, it\u2019s not the easiest program to use, and it's not totally versatile. It\u2019s perfectly capable of animations, for example, but some professional animators and VFX artists may be better served by Maya.\nWe also ran into issues when using too many plugins, as they can interact in somewhat unpredictable ways. Complex plugins that stress the PC can make 3ds Max unstable on occasion. There\u2019s also a potential barrier to entry: unlike Autodesk\u2019s Maya, 3ds Max is still to this day puzzlingly Windows-only. Perpetual licences are a thing of the past for most professional software, and as such, 3ds Max is only available with a monthly, annual, or three-yearly subscription. You can also check out the software free for 30-days.\nSee what our sister site CreativeBloq thought in their review.\nBest free 3D modeling software\n2. Blender\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBlender is an open-source 3D creation tool supported by a generous community of developers and users, and is free for personal and commercial use. For that reason, we view it as the best free 3D modelling software for animation and animators.\nThe top free 3D animator used to be the domain of hobbyists wanting to create animated space battles or giant robot films. Now, it\u2019s evolved to the point where many production companies use it to create effects elements for big-budget movies.\nMost other tools in our best 3D design software round-up focus on the modeling or rendering parts of the 3D process. Blender is different, providing the entire pipeline from modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking to video editing.\nIt even has a 2D animation pipeline, if you need to combine 2D elements with 3D models. The pipelining aspect of this tool is perfect for team collaboration, where artists can work on their part of a scene, and then watch it come together with elements created by others.\nAs this is open source software, a large developer community works to extend its functionality over time. However, Blender\u2019s independence from big companies, and its reliance on community support does mean it won\u2019t always have regular updates and timely bug fixes. Despite this, development continues apace to keep Blender the best software for modelling, 3D printing, and much, much more.\nOne feature is real-time rendering using the EEVEE engine, bridging the gap between what was previously possible in real-time and those effects that required exclusively offline processing. It may not be the easiest 3D modeling software to use, but as a free program for Windows, Mac, and Linux, it's a good place to start if you're new to the scene. We also thought Blender was the best Adobe After Effects alternatives for animation and VFX.\nOur sister site CreativeBloq were highly impressed in their review.\nBest 3D modeling software for animators\n3. Autodesk Maya\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're into animation, Autodesk Maya is easily the best 3D graphics software - it was actually one of the first commercial 3D rendering systems to introduce hair and fur.\nAn industry-standard that\u2019s used in countless big-budget productions, like Stranger Things, the program is rich with pro-level features for modeling, texturing, rendering, and more. You'll find tools for character creation and movement, and the simulation of natural elements such as water, fire, sandstorms and explosions. For that reason, it\u2019s often the software of choice for VFX artists and animators.\nMaya now includes Bifrost procedural effects, enabling complex elements to be constructed using dynamic solvers. Once a scene has been created and effects defined, photoreal rendering is available using the Arnold RenderView system for stunningly real results.\nHowever, that means Maya is a hugely advanced tool. And its interface is far less user-friendly than 3ds Max. So, this isn\u2019t easy 3D modeling software for beginners, but for professionals who demand Hollywood-grade crafting.\nOverall, we found Maya to be the software equivalent of the magician's hat from which almost anything can be pulled. Like Blender (and unlike 3ds Max), it's available across Windows, Mac, and Linux. There are three subscription options available, for monthly, annual, or tri-annual payments, as well as a 30-day free trial.\nSee what our sister site CreativeBloq thought in their review\nBest 3D software for 3D printing\n4. ZBrush\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nZBrush is a creative take on modeling in 3D. Like Adobe Substance 3D Modeler, it uses a brush system to enable designers and artists to sculpt digital clay in real-time. Because of this 'virtual claymation' approach, ZBrush proved to be one of the best 3D software for 3D printing.\nIf you're all about design, the program is a natural choice. Objects created in ZBrush tend to have a hand-formed feel. The object construction system lends itself to creating new and interesting shapes, as much as painstakingly recreating existing objects in a 3D space. It also means you can really focus on detailed sculpting, which should come out looking great - it is, after all, some of the best 3D printing software around. Despite an initially complex and unconventional modeling and sculpting method, this arrangement does make it easier for beginners to join the fun.\nThe system can be used with pressure-sensitive pens and graphics tablets to help with the organic nature of a modeling method popular with concept artists, filmmakers, and game developers.\nWe found another artist-friendly feature is a non-linear production path. This lets you revert a design to a previous iteration, make a change, then roll forward again. This flexibility allows for mistakes, changes of mind, or design evolution to be part of the process. The modelling and 3D printing software is available via a subscription for Mac and PC, and you also have a 14-day free trial on offer.\nSee what our sister site CreativeBloq thought in their review\nBest 3D modeling software for architects\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWhile we noted that it\u2019s not really built for interior or landscape design purposes, we praised the tool for offering \u201c absolute complete freedom, with the ability to create anything from a high rise building right down to a stool.\u201d The tool attracts a large, dedicated community following - with vast user-generated object libraries, and pre-constructed elements to use in your own designs.\nYou\u2019ll find four versions of the 3D design app, each offering a better toolset for more professional uses: SketchUp Free lets home users learn to craft 3D objects right in their browser. The SketchUp Go subscription is for 3D modelling on iPad and the web. SketchUp Pro offers more tools, finally including desktop support in addition to its iPad and browser capabilities. Finally, SketchUp Studio, the most advanced package (which sadly lack MacOS support and is Windows-only), emphasises photorealistic models and animation. A 7-day free trial is available.\nAfter following a handful of straightforward tutorials, artists of any skill level can begin crafting complex solid geometric shapes. At SketchUp\u2019s lower end, we found the free version was best for rapidly prototyping concepts, while the more feature-rich ones will let you visualise entire buildings.\nRead our full SketchUp review\nBest 3D modeling software for surfaces\n6. Rhino\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're working with surfaces, Rhino has to be the top choice. When the tool first appeared, even the best 3D modeling software could only handle basic geometry and a few offered splines. Almost none of them could handle NURBS. That\u2019s essential when you\u2019re accurately modeling, for instance, the body of a vehicle or aircraft, or the curvature of someone's face.\nAvailable for both the Mac and PC, Rhino is an especially versatile program. It's capable of sculpting objects, adapting LIDAR scans, working with meshes from other systems. It can even render scenes using raytracing. Like 3ds Max, this also has a plugin solution and a sophisticated developer platform for those wanting to create new ones.\nAlongside the plugins is a scripting language, enabling complex detailing or modification processes to be automated. But even if you\u2019re not a software developer you can create enhanced functionality through Grasshopper, a tool for making form generation algorithms without writing code.\nOverall, Rhino excels at prototyping mechanical parts or using the software for 3D printing concept designs. Our only reservations about it are that for someone coming from a more conventional modeling environment this learning curve can be a steep one, and we find the interface to be a bit clunky compared to others.\nUnlike all other options on this list (aside from Blender which is free), Rhino doesn\u2019t attempt to take money from you each month for using their software. Instead, they offer you a perpetual licence; a rare thing these days that we encourage. In addition to that, they also have an extremely generous 90-day free trial. You can still use the software after that time, only you won\u2019t be able to save your work and any plugins you have installed will stop working until you purchase a license.\nBest 3D modeling software: FAQs\nWhat is 3D modeling?\nWe asked Penny Holton Craig, Principal Lecturer Principal Lecturer in the Department of Digital Arts and Animation at Teeside University, for her definition of 3D modelling:\n\"3D modeling is a vital part of the computer graphics process. It is the creation of objects in 3D space. In some organizations, it's used as a 3D mock-up software to gauge the MVP or test out ideas.\nThere are now a number of ways to create 3D models and the techniques can be split broadly into two areas. Hard surface modeling where you use 3D polygon shapes and vertices to form an object, and digital sculpting where you work with virtual clay.\nHard surface is good for modeling things like buildings and cars, where digital sculpting is better for organic structures such as characters and animals.\n3D models can be created for a variety of applications from product design, engineering, and architecture to movies, games, and commercial advertising.\"\nWhat sort of computer do I need to run 3D modeling software and rendering software?\nAlthough system requirements vary, 3D design software is generally very resource-intensive - so you'll need a computer with good specs to run the program smoothly. The best laptops for architects, for example, are performance-driven, with fast CPUs, lots of RAM, and a strong GPU for visual fidelity,\nOur team has actually tested out the best laptops for Blender. If you just want to have a go, then you should be able to get the program working on a slightly above average PC (or laptop), such as an Intel Core i5 with a decent graphics card and at least 8GB of RAM.\nAs soon as you start to want to create and render detailed computer-generated imagery and visual effects, you will need a more powerful machine. Generally, the best laptops for video editing or the best video editing PCs should be able to easily handle most 3D modeling software.\nHow to choose the best 3D modeling software\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nWhen choosing which software is best for 3D modeling, consider your use and needs, your skill level, your budget, and what fits your creative workflow.\nYour use\nLike the canvas vs the cel, artists and animators need different spaces to create, so factor in how you\u2019ll use the software. The best 3D design software and tools are powerful at everything from modeling and sculpting to motion graphics. Some excel in particular areas or are more suited to specific industries, like the best architecture software. Some make good 3D printing software, while others are better for 3D drawing and sketching.\nYour skill level\nTake your skill-level into account. Some 3D software can be advanced or overwhelming to beginners, so if you\u2019re new to CG graphics and visualizations, start with a tool with a gentler learning curve.\nYour budget\nBudget will be a factor - especially for creatives who demand that professional polish. Top-end software, like Autodesk 3DS Max and Maya, deliver industry-standard results at industry-standard prices. If your needs (or your budget) are less extensive, for example, building a quick mock-up or visualization, tools like Blender and SketchUp Free offer affordable alternatives.\nYour hardware\nThe best 3D modeling software can be pretty resource-intensive, demanding a lot from your computer. You'll need to make sure your hardware can manage heavy workloads. Popular choices in hardware for heavy workloads include the best laptop for engineering students, best mobile workstations, and best workstations, but it's about finding the right balance.\nYour creativity\nBe subjective. Choose the software that feels comfortable for you, and matches your flow.\nHow we test the best 3D modeling software\nOur team of expert reviewers have benchmarked hundreds of creative apps, from the best digital art and drawing software to the best video editing software. We take the same rigorous approach, whether we're reviewing photo editors or 3D printing software.\nWhen we test which 3D modeling software is best, we\u2019re looking for outstanding examples of what matters to users.\nWe expect to see good 3D software exhibit a strong user experience and an interface that\u2019s intuitive and navigable. We're not just looking for the easiest program for 3D modeling. Even more advanced or complex 3D programs, like Rhino and 3ds Max, still needs to be accessible, despite steeper learning curves.\nWe test the performance of each tool, ensuring an optimal creation process and a finished product that\u2019s of high quality. Since every 3D modeling software is different, we also evaluate how well the program meets the needs of its intended user-base with its appropriately equipped toolkit.\nWhen a service is promoted as free, it needs to be genuinely free. No hidden charges, secret subscriptions, or credit card details. Any limitations to free versions, or upgrade costs, must be clearly signposted for the user.\nDuring our test and review of the best 3D modeling software, after signing up to each service, we used a handful of files to see how the software could be used for the editing and development of 3D objects and characters. The aim was to push each software platform to see whether it could simply and easily not just edit a range of content types but also do so faithfully and consistently without recurring errors.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

Chipmaker summoned by Chinese government over security fears in H20 chips\nH20 backlash leads to questions over Nvidia's future in China\n- Nvidia chips under investigation as China questions hidden access in H20 hardware\n- Beijing summons Nvidia after US proposals ignited fears of remote chip surveillance capability\n- TSMC is still building chips for Nvidia, despite regulatory heat and uncertainty in China\nNvidia\u2019s position in the global AI hardware market could soon be under scrutiny following news of an investigation from the Cyberspace Administration of China.\nThe Chinese regulator has summoned the American chipmaker to explain potential \u201cbackdoor\u201d risks in its H20 chips, developed specifically for China after US export restrictions disrupted prior sales of high-end AI processors.\nThe concern stems from US legislative moves proposing location verification systems on chips intended for export, which Chinese authorities fear could compromise data sovereignty and user privacy.\nMounting suspicion\nWhile Nvidia has firmly denied the existence of any such vulnerabilities, the Chinese government\u2019s decision to interrogate the issue introduces a new layer of uncertainty into the company\u2019s already complex relationship with its second-largest market.\nThe regulator has not detailed any specific actions it plans to take, but the call to clarify potential security flaws suggests the company\u2019s access to Chinese institutions could face added friction.\nNvidia\u2019s official position has remained consistent: its chips do not contain any embedded features that could allow remote access or control.\nIn its own words, \u201cCybersecurity is critically important to us,\u201d and no \u201cbackdoors\u201d exist in Nvidia hardware.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nHowever, this reassurance may not be enough to shift growing skepticism, especially as U.S. and Chinese policies around technology exports continue to diverge.\nMeanwhile, Chinese analysts have suggested the move could be a political gesture, mirroring concerns the US has raised about Chinese tech in recent years.\nWhat\u2019s notable is that even amid rising tensions, Nvidia continues to see robust demand for the H20 chip within China.\nThe company has reportedly ordered 300,000 units from TSMC, reflecting the chip\u2019s ongoing relevance to Chinese developers, research institutes, and universities, all of which rely heavily on high-performance AI chips to drive local advancements.\nEven military and state-backed projects are known to use Nvidia technology.\nDespite public optimism and high-profile visits by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to China, the broader regulatory environment is increasingly unpredictable.\nThe regulator is also looking into the acquisition of Israeli chip designer, Mellanox Technologies, claiming Nvidia violated some of the terms in the 2020 conditional approval of the deal.\nSupply chain uncertainty, potential import limits, or changes in licensing rules could eventually impact hardware availability and cost.\nAs both nations dig deeper into their technology standoffs, Nvidia\u2019s global leadership in AI hardware is no longer guaranteed to go unchallenged.\nYou might also like\n- A single ransomware attack has pushed this business into insolvency\n- Check out the best 3D modeling software for 3D printing and more\n- We've rounded up the best portable monitors available now\nEfosa has been writing about technology for over 7 years, initially driven by curiosity but now fueled by a strong passion for the field.

      "text": "China could move away from Nvidia AI chips quicker than expected after brash 'addiction' comments from US Commerce Secretary\nLutnick\u2019s words prove to be fuel for China\u2019s retaliatory tech restrictions\n- Nvidia\u2019s H20 chip became collateral in a heated geopolitical clash\n- Nvidia\u2019s revenue stream risks serious disruption with the Chinese market tightening\n- Chinese tech giants hesitate to abandon Nvidia hardware for weaker alternatives\nChina\u2019s recent decision to tighten restrictions on Nvidia\u2019s H20 chip sales has drawn attention not only because of the technology involved, but also because of the circumstances which triggered it.\nReports indicate comments made by U. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in mid-July 2025 were viewed as both \u201cinsulting\u201d and brash by China's government.\nIn a televised interview, Lutnick stated Washington\u2019s strategy was to ensure Chinese developers became \u201caddicted\u201d to the American technology stack.\nRising tensions after controversial remarks\n\u201cWe don\u2019t sell them our best stuff, not our second-best stuff, not even our third-best,\u201d Lutnick had told CNBC.\n\u201cYou want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack, that\u2019s the thinking,\u201d he added.\nThe Chinese considered this remark unnecessarily arrogant, and it is now engineering a move that presents sustained sales headwinds for Nvidia, a company that has long viewed the country as a major market.\nThe H20 chip, developed specifically for China after export controls restricted access to more advanced models, had become a key product for local AI firms.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang visited Beijing recently, and stressed the firm\u2019s commitment to staying competitive in the region.\nStill, with China accounting for at least 15% of Nvidia\u2019s total revenue, any disruption to H20 orders represents a serious challenge.\nWashington and Beijing had previously struck a framework agreement earlier in 2025 allowing H20 sales to resume in China while Beijing restored some rare earth exports.\nThat deal was interpreted as a step toward stabilizing relations. Yet by late July 2025, Chinese regulators such as the Cyberspace Administration of China and the Ministry of Industry and Technology began advising firms to halt new H20 orders.\nThis guidance, framed as a response to Lutnick\u2019s remarks, highlights the fragility of recent progress.\nAlongside the restrictions, Beijing has promoted the use of domestic chips, including those from Huawei.\nHowever, doubts remain about their effectiveness, and DeepSeek had to delay the launch of its new R2 model after difficulties training with Huawei Ascend processors.\nChinese tech giants like Alibaba, Baidu, and ByteDance have also been reluctant to fully switch, citing stronger performance from Nvidia hardware compared with local alternatives.\nThe episode illustrates how political statements can rapidly alter corporate fortunes, especially when national security and technology leadership are at stake.\nWhile Nvidia has disputed claims of security risks tied to its products, Beijing\u2019s regulators appear determined to limit reliance on US-made chips.\nWhether Chinese firms can scale up to fill the gap remains uncertain, but what is clear is that Lutnick\u2019s words have accelerated a process of decoupling that may unfold far quicker than industry analysts initially expected.\nVia Financial Times\nYou might also like\n- Microsoft restricts access to its cyber early warning systems for some Chinese firms\n- Access powerful chips with the best cloud computing services\n- Fancy an upgrade?

      "text": "The best processor in 2025: top Intel and AMD CPUs to upgrade your PC\nThe best processor for you will meet your performance needs without going over your budget. It'll have some degree of future proofing so you won't be inclined to upgrade shortly after picking up a piece of new hardware, and it'll be compatible with the rest of your system.\nChoosing between AMD vs Intel is another important decision, as each offers unique advantages depending on your system and goals.\nThat's exactly why we've chosen processors for a range of different PCs to make this roundup.\nAs far as critical PC upgrades go, the CPU is near the top of the list. A high-quality processor will make everything run smoother, from browsing the web to multitasking and even gaming.\nWe've tested every option on this guide so you can be sure our recommendations come from first-hand experience.\nThe quick list\nWe reviewed this guide in August, 2025. Some of the options on this list are a few years old now, but you can often find them at heavily discounted prices and they still offer significant value for self-built PCs.\nBest overall\nValue \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nSpecs \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nPerformance \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nThere are few processors out there right now that are going to match the i7-14700K for performance, and its much better priced.\nBest value\nValue \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nSpecs \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nPerformance \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nThere are very few things to fault this mainstream processor for, as it brings great performance to the table for an even better price.\nBest performance\nValue \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\nSpecs \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\nPerformance \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\nIf you're looking for the best performance out of a desktop processor, this is it. It might be overpriced, but you'll find few processors this powerful.\nBest gaming\nValue \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nSpecs \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nPerformance \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nIf you're looking for the best gaming processor, this is it. Not only does it beat everything Intel brings to the market, it even beats higher-end Ryzen 9 X3D processors.\nBest AM4\nValue \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nSpecs \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nPerformance \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nWhile this chip is a couple years old at this point, it's still one of the best AM4 processors you can get, especially for gaming.\nBest LGA1200\nValue \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nSpecs \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nPerformance \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nIf you've yet to upgrade to an Intel LGA1700 processor but you want the best of the last chipset, the i5-11600K is a remarkably strong chip for the price.\nThe best processor in 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nHere you'll find the best processors in 2025, backed by our rigorous testing and decades of collective experience working with the best CPUs Intel and AMD have to offer. If you want to learn more about CPUs before you buy, check out our what is a processor page for more details.\nThe best processor overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Intel Core i7-14700K is a heck of a processor to end the LGA 1700 era with, thanks to its very solid performance and excellent price for a midrange processor. It's only a small improvement over its predecessor, but it does pack four additional efficiency cores for better multitasking and freeing up the performance cores to focus on the workloads that need that extra power.\nIt also comes with discrete Wi-Fi 7 and Thunderbolt 5 support out the box, and even though those technologies are still a ways away from becoming mainstream, it's nice to have a certain level of future proofing a new processor.\nWhile this chip boasts similar performance to the Intel Core i9-13900K, it also has a similar problem managing heat, so you will need the best CPU cooler around to keep this chip from throttling, which is something some i7 users might not have been used to in the past.\nRead the full Intel Core i7-14700K review\nThe best affordable processor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe most value-oriented processor in the new AMD Zen 4 lineup is the AMD Ryzen 5 7600X, but don't let its price fool you: this chip is anything but a lightweight. Sure, it can't hold up against the massive, 16-core Ryzen 9 7950X, but its single-core performance is nearly on par with its beefier cousins.\nWhat's more, the lack of V-Cache doesn't slow this chip down one bit when it comes to gaming performance, and gamers looking to make the jump to AMD's AM5 platform will find a lot to love about this processor, especially as its more accessible cost helps to offset the cost of a new motherboard and RAM.\nFortunately, you won't need a different CPU cooler if you already have one compatible with AM4, and fortunately the Ryzen 5 7600X manages to stay cool under load.\nRead the full AMD Ryzen 5 7600X review\nThe best processor for performance\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Intel Core i9-14900K normally wouldn't be the kind of chip I'd put on this list, given its fairly mild gen-on-gen performance increase, but there's no denying that the 14900K is the fastest chip Intel \u2014 or anyone, really \u2014 has put out.\nRight out of the box, this chip is capable of hitting 6.0GHz, something no other consumer processor can do. And while it can only do so under the right conditions, it still counts, and it's why Intel maintains its performance lead over AMD as it heads into a new era next year with a redesigned Meteor Lake processor.\nAnd all for the same price as its predecessor, which is a relief given the way inflation has been wrecking havoc around the world.\nIt's not without its faults. The 13900K will likely be a better value for you, if you can find it, and this level of performance comes with more heat than any other chip we've ever teted, so make sure you've got the best cooling solution possible.\nRead the full Intel Core i9-14900K review\nThe best processor for gaming\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is easily the best AMD processor on the market for gamers, thanks to its outstanding performance in just about any game you throw at it thanks to its 3D V-Cache technology.\nIts non-gaming performance isn't as great, however, so if you're looking for a chip that can do everything, the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X is a great option in this tier, assuming you don't want to go with the Intel Core i7-14700K listed above.\nThis is also an expensive chip, though it's somewhat more reasonably priced than the Ryzen 9 7950X3D. If you don't already have an AM5 motherboard though, by wary that you will need to upgrade a lot of components in your PC as well in order to run the new AMD ryzen processors.\nRead the full AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D review\nThe best processor for AM4 motherboards\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D is - without question - one of the best processors for gaming on the market. With incredible performance thanks to AMD's 3D V-Cache technology, the 5800X3D punches way above its weight class and can even beat out the more expensive Core i9-12900K when it comes to gaming.\nSince this is essentially an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X with triple the cache memory thanks to a new microarchitecture that lets AMD 'stack' cache on the CPU die, it keeps the same AM4 motherboard socket as earlier Ryzen chips - meaning that you don't need to spend more to upgrade your motherboard if you're already rocking an AM4 system.\nThis is still a last-gen chip though, so you're not going to get all the perks of the AM5 platform like PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 RAM, but if you've got an AM4 system and you want an upgrade but not ready for a total overhual, this is a great chip to carry you for another couple of years at least.\nRead the full AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D review\nThe best processor for LGA 1200 motherboards\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIntel's 11th-gen processors generally weren't much to celebrate, given that they didn't provide all that much of a gen-on-gen performance increase. But the Core i5-11600K is a noteable exception, providing outstanding performance for the price, making it a great chip to upgrade to if you are still using an Intel LGA 1200 system.\nYou won't be able to take advantage of the latest PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 RAM, however, and the i5-11600K's performance comes at the cost of power consumption and heat, which might require you to upgrade your CPU cooler to compensate. This might possibly even mean upgrading to an AIO cooler, whereas earlier generations could get away with air cooling.\nStill, if you're not ready just yet to make the jump to Intel's 12th- or 13th-gen chips \u2014 especially if you are waiting for Intel's 14th-gen chips, which will use a whole new LGA 1851 socket.\nRead the full Intel Core i5-11600K review\nFrequently asked questions about processors\nWhat does \"3D\" mean in an AMD processor?\nIf you see the \"3D\" suffix, such as on processors like the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, that means the processor utilizes AMD's 3D V-cache technology. The chip uses additional layers of L3 cache memory stacked on top of each other, creating more cache capacity and improving gaming performance.\nIt's often a wise choice to opt for a 3D processor if you're going to use your PC for resource-heavy gaming.\nIs a good CPU important for gaming?\nYes, the vast majority of the time you will want an efficient CPU to run your gaming PC. While some games are more GPU heavy and don't rely as much on the CPU, your processor still carries out critical functions to keep your gaming running smoothly and will slow you down if it's not up to snuff.\nHow we test processors\nIt's impossible to tell the best processors from the worst just by looking at them. All of the core components are hidden away in near-identical packaging, and even if you were to peel back that packaging, the transistors on the CPU die are literally measured in nanometers. How can you tell a million transistors on a chip from a billion, and how can you measure a processor's clock cycle by looking at the box?\nFortunately, there are tests we can run to see how well a processor performs in the real world, and the best way to do that is to push a processor to its limits by running finely-calibrated benchmarking tools that produce comparable scores based on how well a processor performed a specific task - like compressing a video file, or performing the complex math used for 3D gaming.\nWe use industry-standard tools like Geekbench 6, Cinebench R24, and PCMark 10 to synthetically push processors to the limit using realistic workloads that you're likely to experience in day-to-day use.\nWe also use modern PC games set to the lowest graphical settings on the best available gaming hardware to isolate CPU performance while gaming, which we measure in frames per second.\nThen, with the scores in hand, we look at the price of the processor. The best processors offer either best-in-class performance regardless of price, or compelling value for the customer. We won't score a CPU highly if its performance is just fine but it's out of reach for most people's budgets.\nFor more information, see How We Test.\nToday's deals on the best processors\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.\nNamed by the CTA as a CES 2020 Media Trailblazer for his science and technology reporting, John specializes in all areas of computer science, including industry news, hardware reviews, PC gaming, as well as general science writing and the social impact of the tech industry.\nYou can find him online on Bluesky @johnloeffler.bsky.social\n- Marcus Mears IIIComputing Reviews and Buying Guides Editor"

      "text": "Best portable monitor of 2025: Perfect picks for presentations, business travel, and remote work\nWe tested out the top portable monitors for work, play, and streaming\nAfter testing and reviewing the best portable monitors, I've hand-picked the best of the best for every use - from business travel and remote work to streaming movies and playing games.\nMy top pick overall is the Arzopa Z1RC, which delivers an impressive 2.5K resolution on a 16in display at a great price. Having tested this one out, we found picture quality was excellent and colors remained vibrant.\nSome other top recommendations here include the professional Lenovo ThinkVision M14t Gen 2, and for those on a budget, both the KYY K3 and the AOC 16T3EA offer plenty to like for the price. And while almost all are suitable for Apple laptops, I still think the best portable monitor for MacBook Pro laptops and Macs is the stunning espressoDisplay, which just looks the part in the Apple ecosystem.\nEvery model featured in this round-up has been extensively tested, and we've assessed screen size, image quality, color accuracy, and connectivity.\nUpdate: In my latest update, I've cleaned up the Also Tested section with some honorable (and not so honorable) mentions.

A display like the Z1RC might not have every bell and whistle, but like most of the company\u2019s line-up, it\u2019s affordable and suitable for most uses, like working, streaming, presenting, and light gaming.\nThe IPS panel on the Z1RC features 2560 x 1600 resolution, 60Hz refresh rate, two USB-C ports and a mini HDMI port. Dimensions run to 356 x 240 x 9mm, weighing 763g. Color coverage is fair, and we recorded 100% sRGB, 89% AdobeRGB, 95% P3, and 69% of Rec 2020. We did find the viewing angle to be somewhat narrow at 85 degrees. Nor is it the brightest portable screen we\u2019ve tested. Despite claims of 500nits peak brightness, it\u2019s arguably closer to 400, with our own tests showing the backlight hit around 337nits with a contrast of 1060:1. We also felt a protective case is a necessity if you plan to use this portable monitor for travel.\nOverall, there may be better portable monitors out there, but not at this price. Top lternatives we like include the gaming-focused Arzopa Z1FC and the 15.6in Arzopa S1 Table.\nRead our full Arzopa Z1RC review\nThe best cheap portable monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a cheap portable monitor: The real stand-out feature of this display is the price, which is around $100 / \u00a3100 - and we\u2019ve seen it discounted to around $70 on Amazon, too.\n\u2705 You want a lightweight screen: We really like how light and portable this display is, even at 15.6in, weighing in at around 1.70lb / 770g.\n\u274c You\u2019re a creator: One of the weakest parts here is the color gamut, which is very low compared to other displays we\u2019ve tested. Definitely not one for accurate content creation.\n\u274c You\u2019ve got a bigger budget: For a few bucks more, there are better options out there that won\u2019t see you compromising on color reproduction and, in some cases, even boost resolutions.\nThe KYY K3 may not be the best portable monitor in the world, but for the extremely low price, it delivers everything we\u2019d expect from a cheap, lightweight display - and a few features we didn\u2019t expect. The handful of flaws we found can be pretty much overlooked considering the cost.\nDesign is nice - nothing ground-breaking, but simple and practical, and very easy to use. Power button, menu select wheel, and an audio jack can be found on the left. There\u2019s even a set of built-in speakers, although as you\u2019d expect from a budget device, audio quality is tinny. Port selection is fine. Along the right-hand side, you\u2019ll find two USB-C and a mini HDMI input, making it pretty straightforward to connect a laptop, mobile device, or games console. You\u2019ll also get a range of cable adapters for more connectivity.\nWhat we really liked is the inclusion of a full OSD menu, letting you tweak the likes of color temperature, contrast levels, and Eco modes - not every portable monitor has this, so to see it on a low-cost display is a nice touch. Speaking of color, though, the gamut here is pretty woeful. We measured 64% sRGB and 49% for both AdobeRGB and P3, which rules this out for use by creative professionals. Still, for a sub-$100 portable monitor that comes with power supply, cables, and case that doubles as a stand, and with a 1080p resolution, this little screen ticks a lot of boxes.\nRead our full KYY K3 review\nThe best portable monitor for business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want excellent resolution: With a resolution of 1440p (or 2.2K), this portable screen offers a bit more than the standard 1080p you\u2019ll find on most displays of this size.\n\u2705 You want real portability: We\u2019ve long been championing 14in as the perfect size for a business laptop, and the M14t Gen 2 fits nicely in that niche, too - big enough to see, small enough to travel.\n\u274c You need true color coverage: 100% sRGB isn\u2019t bad for a portable display, but it won\u2019t suit professional photographers and designers.\n\u274c You need a budget portable display: It may be cheaper than the Gen 1 was, but the Lenovo ThinkVision M14t Gen 2 is still about $400 / \u00a3400 new.\nPart of Lenovo\u2019s Think series, the M14t Gen 2 is a 14in touchscreen portable business monitor that\u2019s overall optimal for working, watching, and low-level photo and video editing.\nWe\u2019ve used plenty of ThinkPads in our time, and while the laptops\u2019 keyboard and build quality are outstanding, the screens never stood out against the likes of Apple MacBook Pro. So, how does the ThinkVision M14t Gen 2 measure up?\nThis iteration boasts 1440p resolution, 16:10 aspect ratio, 100% sRGB color gamut, and 1500:1 contrast ratio. At $400 / \u00a3400, it\u2019s around a hundred bucks cheaper than the Gen 1 was on release (as an older model, it\u2019s decidedly cheaper now). So, in every way, it addresses the issues we had with the otherwise perfectly acceptable predecessor.\nImage quality is excellent, and we had no issues editing videos and photos, or watching YouTube videos. Text was crisp, colors were accurate, vibrant, blacks were deep. Using the touchscreen and included stylus was simple and snappy - although it\u2019s not going to be your go-to drawing tablet. Nor will it meet serious gaming needs due to high input latency. If that\u2019s not an issue, the Lenovo ThinkVision M14t Gen 2 is one of the best portable computer monitors you can get.\nRead our full Lenovo ThinkVision M14t Gen 2 review\nThe best portable monitor for Mac & MacBook Pro\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an attractive portable display: We love the slick, professional design of the espressoDisplay, which neatly fits Apple\u2019s eye-catching aesthetic.\n\u2705 You want a portable laptop monitor to boost productivity: One of the reasons we love the espressoDisplay is the boost to productivity we found from this slim, minimalist screen.\n\u274c You need a simple travel monitor for a laptop: This portable display is, like an Apple device, a bit of a statement piece as much as it is a productivity tool.\n\u274c You need a cheap portable laptop monitor: The premium build and design of this display is reflected in the price.\nThe espressoDisplay 15 is our pick for best portable for Mac,MacBook Pro, and Mac mini devices. True, most displays here are compatible with Apple devices, but the espressoDisplay\u2019s sleek design fits well with the Mac aesthetic - and it showed outstanding performance when we hooked it up to our MacBook Pro 16in. With two USB-C inputs, though, you\u2019ll find it works well with most Windows laptops, too.\nAttached to the magnetic stand, you can smoothly switch from landscape to portrait mode quickly - an essential feature for photographers and designers. There\u2019s also a Creator screen protector, adding a matte finish to the glass screen, which we found made it easier to view in direct sunlight, and write on using the espresso stylus.\nUsing the screen for everything from work communications to review writing and photo editing, the portable display never missed a beat. It felt a natural fit for a more productive and efficient working environment. We\u2019re not saying we got obsessed with the espressoDisplay, but we did find multiple reasons during the review period to work from home, just to have an excuse to use it. We also like the option of choosing a 13- or 15-in version depending on how portable you need it to be.\nRead our full espressoDisplay 15 review\nThe best portable monitor for gaming\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to play games: With a future-proof 240Hz refresh rate, this Asus portable screen is geared towards gamers.\n\u2705 You want a large portable monitor with built-in battery: The Asus ROG Strix XG17AHPE boasts a 7,800 mAh battery built in, lasting up to four hours at 240Hz on a single charge.\n\u274c You want to watch or work: If you\u2019ll mostly be watching YouTube and Netflix, or using office apps, this monitor is probably overkill.\n\u274c You need a cheap portable monitor: As you\u2019d expect with specs like this, the portable monitor isn\u2019t as cheap as the sub-$100 displays you\u2019ll find on Amazon.\nA 17.3in full HD display with a 240Hz refresh rate gives the Asus ROG Strix XG17AHPE the edge. The best portable gaming monitor we\u2019ve tried, this device is focused, offers no compromises, suitable for the most dedicated players.\nEven with its broad screen, the device is just 0.4in thin, weighing around 1kg, with a USB-C and miniHDMI ports along the side. In our hands, the well-built ROG Strix XG17AHPE showed no signs of bend or flex. It comes packages with a case and compact tripod, which is a thoughtful touch.\nIn use, the large portable display is vivid, crisp. When we tried games like Overwatch, Valorant, and Call of Duty, colors were popping off the screen without oversaturation, remaining distinct even in darker areas of the game. And we loved the smoothness that came with a higher refresh rate, with no ghosting and blur. Audio is loud and clear, too.\nYes, it\u2019s a bit overkill if you\u2019re presenting or Netflix-ing the night away (although it\u2019s perfectly capable of doing it). Also, while current-gen consoles are only capable of 120Hz, the refresh rate here offers in-built future-proofing, and the Switch and PlayStation still felt smooth during our gameplay tests.\nRead our full Asus ROG Strix XG17AHPE review\nThe best cheap portable monitor alternative\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a standard FHD display that won\u2019t break the bank: The AOC 16T3EA is a solid all-rounder that delivers what most need from a portable monitor at a reasonable price.\n\u2705 You want a lightweight, slimline screen for on the go work: In our tests, we found the AOC 16T3EA felt particularly good for business use.\n\u274c You need high-resolution and high color coverage: It\u2019s only 1080p, has a low 250cd/m\u00b2 brightness, and scrapes by on 56% sRGB, 41% Adobe RGB, and 41% DCI-P3 - so, this is not a display for content creators.\n\u274c You need a portable monitor for gaming: With only 60Hz refresh rate, this will be fine for single-player games on the go, but won\u2019t meet demands for high-speed multiplayer gaming.\nThe AOC 16T3EA may have some minor limitations, notably the color accuracy, it\u2019s well-priced for a portable full HD display.\nWith its 15.6in 1080p IPS display and a slim, lightweight design, we found it a very effective multi-tasking companion for on-the-go professionals. We were impressed by the 14mm profile and 870g weight, even with two built-in kick-stands tucked away around the back for portrait and landscape orientation. Helping to maintain that compact form is the inclusion of a single USB-C connection. Just plug it into any compatible Windows or Mac laptop and you\u2019re away.\nAnd this may be the first deal-breaker. There are no other ports along the display. Not even an audio jack. We also noted the disappointing brightness (just 250cd/m\u00b2), while color coverage is effectively non-existent (56% sRGB, 41% Adobe RGB, and 41% DCI-P3). And the lack of anything beyond OSD controls means we can\u2019t recommend this for content creators and photographers. But for anyone looking for a smartly designed portable second-screen, there\u2019s a lot to like.\nRead our full AOC 16T3EA review\nThe best big-screen portable monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a big screen: At 27in, this is one of the largest portable monitors we\u2019ve reviewed, offering plenty of screen real estate for work, collaboration, or presenting.\n\u2705 You want high resolutions: Most traditional portable displays hover around the 1080p mark, which is fine for smaller screens, but this one boasts 2.5K QHD resolution.\n\u274c You want actual portability: Yes, it\u2019s slim and fairly lightweight, but this isn\u2019t a monitor you\u2019ll want to cart around with you regularly.\n\u274c You just want a standard portable monitor: With these specs, the screen is likely overpowered if all you want to do is hook up a second screen to your laptop.\nDespite its 27in QHD IPS panel, the Asus ZenScreen MB27ACF is surprisingly slim and relatively lightweight. For me, this is ideal for a single-station set-up or use across an office where you need to key into the details or collaborate with others. I wouldn\u2019t like to be carrying this on the commute everyday, especially since it doesn\u2019t come with a case or sleeve for protection.\nThe screen is clear, with a matte anti-glare covering but no touchscreen capabilities. Specs-wise, you\u2019re looking at 2.5K resolution, 1500:1 contrast ratio, 300 nits brightness (so about average), and 99% sRGB. That feels about right, but I would've loved to see a wider color gamut so creators could benefit from the large-screen portability, too. It does have built-in speakers along the bottom. They sound nice enough, although I\u2019d still recommend external speakers or headphones for almost any portable monitor.\nAround the back is a fold-out kick-stand, which I initially found a little stiff but otherwise works well (for security, I\u2019d advise using both hands on either side of the stand to pull it into position). You can effectively set this up anywhere. Better still, Asus also supplies a monitor arm and hooks for hanging the monitor in the box. There\u2019s no battery built in, so you\u2019ll need to run it off the mains. Port selection is standard - HDMI, USB-C with DP Alt Mode, and an audio jack. It also features a 70W USB-C power delivery, too. Right now, this is a solid pick for anyone who needs a large-sized portable monitor, particularly for business-use.\nRead our full Asus ZenScreen MB27ACF review\nThe best OLED portable monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want OLED brightness: The standout feature of this portable computer monitor is the OLED screen that really makes colors pop.\n\u2705 You want a portable screen for on-the-go color work: While not ideal for everyone, a decent color space coverage makes this a fair choice for those working with colors.\n\u274c You don\u2019t need OLED: Not everyone using a portable monitor will need this sort of screen, which adds a fair amount to the price-tag and may be overkill for many uses.\n\u274c You need exact pantones: Color coverage is fair, but it's not precise, and the lack of high resolutions may make this unsuited for professional designers.\nThe Innocn 15A1F is one of the best portable monitors around - light, compact, a well-sized 15.6in screen at 1080p, it covers most bases. It\u2019s not the only portable OLED display out there, but it\u2019s a great option if you\u2019re looking for a crisp, bright screen at a relatively affordable price.\nAlong the device you\u2019ll find two USB-C ports (one for 45W power) and a HDMI 1.4 port. This means you can easily connect it straight to a laptop or games console. However, the 60Hz refresh rate will have limited appeal to serious gamers. Using it on a Windows computer, the desktop appeared remarkably punchy, boasting inky blacks and highly saturated colours. Our only real complaint is the reflective nature of the glossy glass screen.\n400nits is the stated brightness for this panel. In our tests, it hit 406.2nits at 100% brightness setting. Impressive, but not bright enough for true HDR output. Base color coverage runs to 100% sRBG, 98.3% Adobe RGB, and 100% DCI-P3 - so, if you don\u2019t mind the limited screen size, there\u2019s potential here if you\u2019re a designer or working with color.\nRead our full Innocn 15A1F review\nThe best portable monitor for creators\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're a creator: The real star of the show here is the color accuracy and color gamuts, which make it ideal for all types of content creator on the go.\n\u2705 You want an OLED panel: The OLED feature here make it another good pick for those who want a bright (but not too bright) panel for easy viewing even in direct sunlight.\n\u274c You want a higher resolution: While the specs are popping off almost across the board, you might expect higher than 1080p resolution - not that you need 4K with a screen this size.\n\u274c You\u2019re on a budget: The excellent performance and build quality for this device does come at a cost.\nIf you're a content creator or creative professional who needs a portable monitor while working across multiple locations, the ViewSonic VP16 OLED is a top pick. What really caught our eye during review is the wide color gamut and overall accuracy.\nThis display boasts DCI-P3, sRGB, REC.709, and DICOM color modes that impressed us during review. it's also really easy to switch between them all using the on-screen display or the buttons located at the foot of the screen. There's Pantone validation and DisplayHDR 400 certification here, too, and ViewSonic guarantee average Delta E of less than two - in our tests, we measured it at just 0.5.\nSo, what didn't we like? Our biggest issue is that it's not a 10-bit display but 8-bit plus FRC. Resolution sits at just 1080p, which may be a deal-breaker for some. However, under review, text, photos, and videos all looked sharp, so don't let that put you off. On paper, it's pretty average brightness, too, but although we measured brightness at 402cd/m2, it's difficult to imagine anyone having problems using this even in direct sunlight. And, as usual with even some of the best portable monitors, the speakers aren't great.\nBut that's not why you'd buy a display like this - it's for the excellent color accuracy. And on that score, it's difficult to find fault.\nRead our full ViewSonic VP16 OLED review\nThe best laptop screen extender\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a triple-screen set-up: With two portable screens sitting either side of your laptop screen, the Maxfree S6 is a great productivity tool.\n\u2705 You use it at one or two locations: We found this a great addition to our home office workspace, but as a dual-screen device, it\u2019s undeniably heavy and not great for travel.\n\u274c You need a budget screen extender: Laptop screen extenders are already more expensive than a standalone display, and the Maxfree S6 is at the upper end of the scale. For a budget alternative, look to a brand like Arzopa and AOC.\n\u274c Your laptop is not between 13in and 17in: The S6 fits 13-17in laptops, so if you're running a netbook or an especially large display, it won\u2019t be suitable.\nThe Maxfree S6 is a dual-portable monitor with two 15.6in screens that unfold, sitting either side of your Windows or Mac laptop. Best for business use and multi-tasking, it\u2019s really easy to set up, with a standard-issue 15.6in IPS panel featuring 1920 x 1080 resolution, 16:9 aspect ratio, and 60Hz refresh rate. A fairly low 1000:1 contrast ratio and 300cd/m\u00b2 brightness, and a very low 72% NTSC colour gamut round out this portable screen.\nWhat really sets this unit apart from other triple-monitor units is the flexibility over positioning the two screens. Each one is independent of the other, letting you place either in portrait or landscape orientation, using just one or both. Each monitor will also require its own power supply, so make sure your laptop has enough ports or you\u2019re using a USB hub.\nIdeal for use in the office or home office, given its size and weight (360.7 x 216.6 x 45mm / 2.3kg), it\u2019s certainly portable - but it\u2019s undeniably bulky, and we found using the supplied case a necessity over cramming it into a laptop bag. For a smaller, more portable option, check out our The Portable Monitor Flex 14-inch review. It's also not the cheapest laptop screen extender we\u2019ve seen out there. For low-cost alternatives, we recommend looking at models from brands like Arzopa and AOC.\nRead our full Maxfree S6 Triple Laptop Screen Extender review\nThe best small portable monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a tiny travel-friendly display: At just 13.3in, the CrowVi is ideal for those who want a small, lightweight portable display for travel.\n\u2705 You want a touchscreen device: Not all portable monitors we try have touchscreen, but it's a welcome addition to this small and simple unit.\n\u274c You need a bright, high-resolution screen: While we enjoyed our time with the CrowVi, it's not the brightest you can find.\n\u274c You need the thinnest portable monitor you can: It may boast a small screen, but this is certainly not the thinnest portable display we've tested.\nThe CrowVi portable monitor from Elecrow has all the bells and whistles of a modern screen while being simple and small. The glossy 13.3in FHD IPS panel is bright at 300 nits and offers an 800:1 contrast level. Being thin at less than 10mm and weighing around 350 grams, the monitor can easily be moved around. The IPS technology also provides a great viewing angle and faithful color reproduction. The supplied plastic cover doubles as a stand while protecting the screen.\nWe found the display worked right out of the box, providing superb image quality and a touch interface. The low power consumption and built-in speaker make it an essential accessory for crowded spaces like desktops. Its best feature is that it works with only one Type-C connection, providing power, display, and touch input.\nOur biggest issue using the CrowVi is its glossy screen, which can distract from serious work. The bezel isn\u2019t the smallest found on a portable display, and while using only a slide button for the menu might be economical, this renders navigating the settings time-consuming. But, perhaps, that's the trade-off for a cheap portable monitor that's on the small side compared to most. See our Read our full CrowView Note review for a larger alternative from the same makers.\nRead our full CrowVi review\nThe best dual-screen portable monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want two screens with higher than usual resolution: Both of these 16in screens have a resolution of 2.5K, ideal for\n\u2705 You're a creator: There are two factors that make this model stand out to me - 100% sRGB color gamut and a touchscreen with pen support.\n\u274c You need a highly portable monitor: With its dual-screen set-up and 16in screens, it's a large and heavy device.\n\u274c You need a portable monitor for gaming: While we liked a lot of the specs here, the 60Hz refresh rate limits its use for gamers.\nThe Delta Pro Touch from monitor-makers Uperfect is a pretty impressive device, all told. Here, you get two 16in 2.5K monitors, each covering 100% of the sRGB color gamut, and both supporting touch interface. There's even a stylus included in the box, which makes it one of the best portable monitors for creators, photographers, and anyone editing images.\nAfter unboxing our review unit, we gave it the once over. Design-wise, it's fairly compact, but it's not one for everyday carry - better to set it up in one location, rather than carting around multiple locations in a day (although that's absolutely a possibility). The included kickstand also felt stable and was versatile in use.\nTesting this portable monitor for over two weeks, we connected it to a range of devices, including a MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, Dell Precision and ThinkPad laptops, and even set it up to display Apple TV on one screen and a Mac on the other. Throughout this time, we had no issues with performance at all. Thanks to the built-in screen rotation tool, it also served as a good presentation unit, letting others see what you see when folded over.\nPorts selection is straightforward enough but hardly generous, with just a USB-C and mini HDMI port, but there's already two screens here, so we wouldn't\nIt's not as widely available as I'd like - you can get it shipped worldwide from the Uperfect website, of course, but beyond AliExpress, I can't see many options out there for the UK, Europe, and Australia. Still, at the time of writing it's been heavily discounted on both sites, which may swing it for you.\nRead our full Uperfect Delta Pro Touch review\nBest portable monitor: Also tested\nNot every portable monitor we test can be considered the best, but each of these deserve an honorable mention.\nWe really liked this slick and slim portable monitor for its lightweight design and high-resolution screen.

Plug one end into your device, the other end into the display, and head into your operating system's display settings for further configurations like mirroring.\nSome portable monitors also connect to devices via USB-A, mini-HDMI, micro-HDMI, and VGA. Check your manual for full details.\nAre portable monitors compatible with all devices?\nYou'll find the best portable monitors are compatible with laptops, tablets and gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch. Depending on the portable monitor model, it may be possible to hook up to display to a desktop, but if you have the space for a second full-sized monitor, this will be usually be the better option for productivity gains.\nDo portable monitors have built-in speakers?\nSome of the best portable monitor models do feature built-in speakers. However, when it comes to internal speakers, we find audio quality varies greatly. Lower-priced portable monitors often having a shallow, tinny sound to them, lacking in bass. These speakers will be fine for presentations or in a pinch, but pale in comparison to those with dedicated audio systems or external speakers.\nDo portable monitors require external power?\nIt depends on the model. Some portable monitors feature a built-in rechargeable battery, while others will draw power from the connected device.\nBoth have pros and cons. A portable monitor with a battery means you can use it for longer on the go, but it will be heavier. They're also more expensive. A display without a battery is lighter to carry, but will drain your device faster if you're not connected to the mains.\nHow to choose the best portable monitor for you\nChoosing portable monitor hinges on your use case and to what device you are connecting.\nHardware & connections\nWhen selecting the best monitors for a dual set-up, most people pair a portable monitor with a USB-C-equipped laptop. When it comes to plug-and-play simplicity, these are usually the top option, ensuring both compatibility and plenty of bandwidth for any resolution a portable monitor is likely to offer. That said, many mobile screens also support mini-HDMI, micro-HDMI, USB-A, and VGA. Just be aware that it may require software and drivers, which could present a problem depending on your device to drive the display.\nScreen size & resolution\nScreen size is an important deciding factor - big enough to complete tasks, small enough to carry with you. Most of the best portable monitors are 15.6-inch panels with a 1080p resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels - although 4K portable monitors are becoming increasingly prevalent, with better color accuracy and color space coverage for creatives. However, 10 to 13in screens are available for true portability.\nRefresh rate & response time\nMost of the portable monitors we review have a refresh rate of 60Hz - standard for most monitors, except for the best gaming monitors. if gaming if your prime concern, and where every millisecond counts, check for a screen that refreshes the on-screen image faster. Look for 120Hz or 240Hz. Response times refer to how long it takes for a pixel on your monitor to change - the quicker, the better, especially for games.\nBattery\nBattery or no battery is another critical question. You can get portable screens both with and without built-in power. Cheap portable monitors tend to come without a battery, and are lighter. However, if you\u2019re using a mobile screen away from the mains, they will drain your laptop\u2019s battery pretty fast.\nBrightness\nBrightness is a significant factor, particularly for creative work and gaming. If you plan to use your portable display outside, you want as much of that as humanly possible. Most are limited, only topping out at a little over 200 nits. Aim for the brightest, highest luminance you can get - although brighter displays will use up even more battery when powered by your laptop. We always test the luminance of a device to see how well it holds up against the manufacturer's claims.\nBudget\nThe best portable monitors range in price, from as little as $50 up to hundreds of dollars for premium displays - so it's easy to find one that does everything you need at the right price. Don't forget to check Black Friday portable monitor deals and Prime Day portable monitor deals when the seasonal shopping sales are on.\nHow we test the best portable monitors\nWe've tested a range of professional displays, including the best monitors for video editing, the best monitors for MacBook Pro, and the best monitors for photo editing. We've also reviewed the best monitors and best business monitors. So, we know what to look out for when you need a second screen to take with you.\nAll devices featured in this round-up have been tested by us. We evaluate these displays across many aspects, starting with the design and dimensions, exploring weight and overall portability. Build quality is essential for the best portable monitors, and we're looking for robust devices that are designed for travel, the commute, and multi-location set-ups.\nFor screens, we look at size, avoiding - and noting - any signs of glossiness and reflectiveness when used in bright rooms or outdoors in sunlight. We also compare each display's resolution, and whether it's capable for the use. For example, we'd expect higher resolutions for photo editing than for streaming movies or presentations at work.\nWe also check brightness and viewing angles - and we always test the manufacturer's claims of brightness. In many cases, peak luminance in a real-world setting is lower than the stated specs, and we'll note this in our review. Where available or relevant, we'll evaluate color accuracy and color coverage to identify the screens with the best image quality.\nFor more, see our guide How we test, review and rate professional and business monitors on TechRadar Pro.\nWe also tested the best monitors for graphic design - and these are the ones we recommend\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

It is not a single form factor in the same way that a desktop or notebook is \u2013 it can take almost any form factor. If mobility and agility are the most important factors for the device you need, you might choose a notebook, but if you need performance tuned to a specific workflow, a workstation will always be the best option.\nWorkstations are designed for professional workflows and are more powerful than a general PC. For example, a data scientist, visual effects professional, engineer or software developer all have different needs in terms of data processing, performance, operating systems, keyboard shortcuts, storage, display and connectivity. They are built for managing those high intensity but diverse workflows.\nThe technology that makes that possible is not always immediately obvious when looking at devices. Some vendors use copper and other software in their products to completely redesign the efficiency of the thermals in mobile workstations. That includes giving users complete control over the type of performance and acoustics for specific workflows, with artificial intelligence often called in to intelligently manage behavior based on the type of work being done.\nThat means generation on generation, CPU and GPU performance improvements on devices mean they are smaller and run cooler, which is important in terms of comfort and reliability on high performance workstations.\nAnother important factor is certification. Certified ISV (Independent Software Vendors) application is crucial, as it ensures the hardware and software work better together. Workstations are the only PCs that offer certified professional applications. Having certification is critical, as it isn't enough to just know that your software applications will run on your workstation: you need a hardware solution that has been tested, proven and certified by ISVs to deliver peak performance for your key applications. This ensures a wholly compatible experience between hardware and software that is stable and designed to perform, allowing you to work with confidence.\nWhat is ECC and why is it so important?\nError Correction Code (ECC) is a type of RAM memory technology which is used in workstations and servers to detect and correct errors that can occur in data storage and processing. It is valued by professionals and businesses with critical data because it helps to ensure the reliability and accuracy of that data, particularly in applications such as servers, scientific computing and financial systems. It can automatically detect and correct memory errors so it has a major role to play in combatting data corruption.\nIn computer memory, data is stored as a series of bits, which are either 0s or 1s. Errors can occur when bits are incorrectly read or written due to various factors such as electrical interference, thermal noise, or manufacturing defects. These errors can result in data corruption, system crashes, or other serious consequences.\nECC works by adding extra bits to the memory data, which are used to detect and correct errors. When data is written to memory, the ECC system calculates a checksum or parity value based on the data and stores it along with the data. When the data is read back from memory, the ECC system checks the checksum or parity value to ensure that the data has not been corrupted. If an error is detected, the ECC system can correct it on the fly by using the additional information stored in the ECC bits.\nHow does it differ from DDR5 on-die ECC?\nOn-die ECC and regular ECC supported modules are not the same. While DDR5 DRAM components will feature on-die ECC to correct bit errors within the chip, this technology is not able to correct errors outside the chip or those that occur on the bus between the module and memory controller housed within the CPU. ECC enabled processors, like Intel Xeons, feature the ECC algorithm that can correct single or multi-bit errors on the fly. However, additional DRAM bits must be available to allow this correction to occur.\nFor DDR4, a memory module transmits data 64-bits at a time. ECC supported DDR4 modules feature an extra 8 bits per 64-bit rank, also referred to as 72-bit or x72. DDR5 splits the memory module into two 32-bit addressable subchannel regions to increase efficiency. To enable ECC, each 32-bit subchannel adds an extra 8-bit DRAM component to become 40-bit, for a total of 80-bits per rank instead of 72-bits. Consumers with PCs and laptops will ultimately experience better data integrity with on-die ECC as the potential for corruption increases with the lithography shrinks and capacity and speed increases. For workstation and server users, ECC class modules will always be a requirement (ECC Registered, ECC Unbuffered, ECC Load Reduced). The increase in the number of DRAM require to enable a DDR5 ECC class module will also increase the costs as compared to DDR4.\nUsing ECC memory can significantly improve the reliability and uptime of computer systems, particularly in high-availability applications where data accuracy and integrity are critical. However, ECC memory is typically more expensive than non-ECC memory and may require special hardware support, so it is not always used in all computer systems.\nHow to choose the best workstation for you\nSince all the best workstations are already specced with the best processors and best graphics cards, a good place to start choosing the right model is by considering the work you need it for. What kind of apps and software will you primarily run on it? Do you need it for incredible graphics performance, or for analyzing huge data sets in a few hours? Do you need it to perform well while managing multiple intensive apps simultaneously? In terms of content creation, you'll find a lot of crossover between the best video editing PCs and workstations, as running that software plays to a workstation's strengths.\nYou'll then want to consider the workstation's design, size, and weight. If you use any of the best standing desks or an L-shaped desk or your office or home office, these typically offer plenty of surface space, so, you can opt for the larger (and usually more powerful) form factor. If you think you might need to move your setup around, then a lightweight and portable workstation will be ideal.\nAlso, look out for the ports and connectivity if you plan to have a multi-screen setup, along with other specifications like the storage, display, and cooling system.\nHow we test the best workstations\nOur team of expert reviewers have gone hands-on with a wide range of hardware for professionals, from identifying the best MacBook Pro to the best laptops for video editing. But whether it's reviewing a content creator's dream machine or the best mobile workstation, we undertake the same rigorous testing process.\nWe evaluated various aspects of different workstations to arrive at the best ones. Performance is essential, so we looked at how the workstations ran different types of applications \u2014 from the best video editing software and other graphics-heavy programs to large data sets.\nWe analyzed numerous specs, like RAM, CPU, display, graphics, and storage, to assess what kinds of users the workstation would be best suited for. For example, while nice to have, a color-accurate screen is far more important for designers and creatives than other professionals.\nWe looked at the connectivity ports the workstation had, whether the fans were noisy, and checked the optimization of the cooling system. We also examined the size, weight, and design of the workstations and included computers of varying builds in our list.\nToday's best deals\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nD\u00e9sir\u00e9 has been musing and writing about technology during a career spanning four decades.
