  "description": "Fear is a wonderful evolutionary gift that\u2019s greatly misunderstood. Learning to listen to it can help you succeed where others fail.",
  "content": "\u2022 Avoidance, inaction or not making an important decision, due to fear of making mistakes\n\u2022 Overcontrolling, micromanaging or not empowering their teammates, due to a fear that they might make mistakes\n\u2022 Withholding feedback, not sharing their honest opinions or not pushing back on bad ideas, due a fear of conflict or political backlash Sound familiar? And yet in order to change, grow, and navigate the endless obstacles facing businesses today, you have to take risks, you have to empower people, and you have to speak your mind honestly. Otherwise, you\u2019ve got no chance. It\u2019s no wonder that 70% of all business transformation initiatives fail, according to McKinsey, with fear playing the largest role in that failure rate. But that\u2019s not to say that fear is the enemy. The truth is, fear is a teacher\u2014and learning to listen to it can help you beat the odds and succeed where others fail.\n\nFear is a wonderful evolutionary gift that\u2019s greatly misunderstood, an emotion meant to protect us. If a shark is chasing you, fear motivates you to swim faster or punch the shark hard on the nose. This is fear at its most useful, its most rational. Irrational fear, however, is less helpful. For example, you might be worried about how to find the right product market fit, which is a very rational thing to be concerned about. But if that concern leads you subconsciously to shut down, withhold information, or not voice your concerns because of a fear of retribution, that makes no sense. Your company will fail if you don\u2019t speak up. In this context, fear can lead to unintentional decisions that actually make things worse. Irrational fears, left unexplored, can be detrimental to every aspect of our lives, personal and professional. But when we look at how fear actually works, we see that it\u2019s not about conquering fear. In fact, we can\u2019t conquer it. We have a fear center\u2014our amygdala\u2014wired into our brains. Like it or not, it has an impact on our perceptions and decisions.\n\nThe key is to understand the impact that fear has on us, stay intentional with how we respond to it, and listen to what fear is trying to show us. When we learn to listen to it, we find that many times, fear is actually our greatest teacher. That\u2019s the key to not letting fear lead to paralysis, micromanaging, or not speaking up when it\u2019s important. Let\u2019s look at how three common fears\u2014which are increasingly prevalent in our modern work environment\u2014may actually be inviting us to take a closer look at our decisions and overcome the real cultural challenges that prevent businesses from adapting and thriving.\n\nUnexplored, FOMO leads to premature decisions without considering the consequences. Take AI, for example. In the race to adopt AI, too many companies moved too quickly without thinking things through. In fact, a recent global study of C-suite executives found that more than half regretted firing people prematurely due to unrealistic expectations around AI. These leaders focused too much on not wanting to lose out on AI, as opposed to staying focused on their purpose and their mission. All too often, FOMO creates a minefield of unintended consequences. FOMO is an excellent reminder to make sure you\u2019re not missing out on what matters. It\u2019s a chance to reconnect to your core purpose, your true north, and your why. AI is a tool; it\u2019s a how. Don\u2019t make your decisions based on anxiety levels. Make them based on what you really care about. On the other end of the spectrum, FOFU can lead to analysis paralysis, procrastination, and a catastrophic loss of early-mover advantage, if left unexplored. In fact, a 2023 survey of more than 14,000 employees and leaders across 17 countries reported that being inundated with too much data and information is leading to an epidemic of indecision. In that study:\n\u2022 74% said the number of decisions they make every day has increased tenfold over the last three years\n\u2022 86% said the volume of data is making decisions in their professional (and personal) lives much more complicated\n\u2022 59% admitted they faced analysis paralysis more than once every single day\n\u2022 And 85% said this inability to make decisions is having a negative impact on their quality of life. That causes spikes in anxiety (36%), missed opportunities (33%), and unnecessary spending (29%). When you feel FOFU paralyzing you, and you feel that spike in anxiety, pause. Breathe. Get curious, and ask yourself what you\u2019re really afraid of. Explore the consequences of doing nothing. Challenge the nightmare scenarios and stories you may be telling yourself. And seek the help of others around you to think things through clearly. This is one of the most prevalent fears. Unexplored, FOBI leads to micromanaging, exaggerating and \u201caccidental narcissism,\u201d or focusing more on optics than outcomes. Maybe you have an important quarterly business review coming up, and there are unpleasant realities to talk about. Maybe you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed at work, but are afraid to ask for help. Or maybe you\u2019re just not sure about your company\u2019s overall strategy and vision, but are suffering from impostor syndrome and feel too scared to say anything. The truth is, fear of inadequacy in the workplace is a lot more common than people realize\u2013probably because we\u2019re so afraid to talk about it. In fact, one 2025 study found that 71% of North American workers reported suffering from impostor syndrome, with half stating it had caused them to miss or turn down opportunities.\n\nWhen you notice your energy focused on yourself and feel like you might be shutting down, that\u2019s your cue to lean into the fear to see what it\u2019s trying to get your attention about. FOBI is asking you to make a conscious decision about what matters more\u2014your insecurity or your impact. It\u2019s giving you the opportunity to choose to rise to the occasion, because the moment matters more than the risk of looking stupid. Whenever I feel nervous about a big moment\u2014like writing my first book, or giving an important speech\u2014I remind myself that my why is bigger than I. It\u2019s a powerful mantra, and an important reminder of the power of purpose. Our fears are not designed to defeat us. They\u2019re actually asking for our attention\u2014to orient us to what matters most. And the leaders who succeed are the ones who learn to listen to their fears, rather than run from them.",

  "summary": "Business leaders often make decisions based on fear, which is often misunderstood as a powerful emotion. Fear can lead to paralysis, overcontrolling, micromanaging, or not empowering teammates due to fear of mistakes, or withholding feedback, or advocating for conflict or political backlash. According to McKinsey, 70% of all business transformation initiatives fail due to the fear of making mistakes. However, fear is a valuable tool in helping businesses adapt and thrive. Three common fears, FOMO, and FOFU, are often cited as reasons for premature decisions without considering the consequences. The author suggests that understanding the impact of fear and listening to it can help you overcome challenges such as AI adoption.",

The study of more than 14,000 employees and business leaders across 17 countries found that people are struggling to make decisions in their personal and professional lives at a time when they are being forced to make more decisions than ever before.\nPeople are overwhelmed by the amount of data and this is damaging trust, making decisions much more complicated, and negatively impacting their quality of life.\n- 74 percent of people say the number of decisions they make every day has increased 10x over the last three years and as they try to make these decisions, 78 percent are getting bombarded with more data from more sources than ever before.\n- 86 percent say the volume of data is making decisions in their personal and professional lives much more complicated and 59 percent admit they face a decision dilemma \u2013 not knowing what decision to make \u2013 more than once every single day.\n- 35 percent don't know which data or sources to trust and 70 percent have given up on making a decision because the data was overwhelming.\n- 85 percent of people say this inability to make decisions is having a negative impact on their quality of life. It is causing spikes in anxiety (36 percent), missed opportunities (33 percent), and unnecessary spending (29 percent).\n- As a result, 93 percent have changed the way they make decisions over the last three years. 39 percent now only listen to sources they trust and 29 percent rely solely on gut feelings.\nBusiness leaders want data to help and know it is critical to the success of their organizations, but don't believe they have the tools to be successful which is eroding their confidence and ability to make timely decisions.\n- 85 percent of business leaders have suffered from decision distress \u2013 regretting, feeling guilty about, or questioning a decision they made in the past year \u2013 and 93 percent believe having the right type of decision intelligence can make or break the success of an organization.\n- 97 percent want help from data. In an ideal world, they want data to help them: make better decisions (44 percent), reduce risk (41 percent), make faster decisions (39 percent), make more money (37 percent), and plan for the unexpected (29 percent).\n- In reality, 72 percent admit the sheer volume of data and their lack of trust in data has stopped them from making any decision at all and 89 percent believe the growing number of data sources has limited the success of their organizations.\n- Managing different data sources has required additional resources to collect all the data (40 percent), made strategic decision making slower (36 percent), and introduced more opportunities for error (26 percent).\n- Business leaders do not believe that the current approach to data and analytics is addressing these challenges. 77 percent say that the dashboards and charts they get do not always relate directly to the decisions they need to make and 72 percent believe most data available is only truly helpful for IT professionals or data scientists.\n- Business leaders know this needs to change. They believe the right data and insights can help them make better HR (94 percent), finance (94 percent), supply chain (94 percent), and customer experience (93 percent) decisions.\nCollecting and interpreting data has driven people to their breaking point at a time when the stakes are incredibly high for business leaders.\n- 70 percent of people say the headache of having to collect so much data and interpret it is too much for them to handle.\n- This is particularly evident in the business world. 78 percent of business leaders say people often make decisions and then look for the data to justify them, 74 percent of employees believe businesses often put the highest paid person's opinion ahead of data, and 24 percent feel that most decisions made in business are not rational.\n- The situation is so challenging that 64 percent of people \u2013 and 70 percent of business leaders - would prefer for all these difficulties to just go away and to have a robot make their decisions.\n- Despite their frustrations with data in their personal and professional worlds, people know that without data their decisions would be less accurate (44 percent), less successful (27 percent), and more prone to error (39 percent).\n- People also believe that an organization that uses technology to make data-driven decisions is more trustworthy (79 percent), will be more successful (79 percent), is a company they're more likely to invest in (76 percent), partner with (77 percent), and work for (78 percent).\n\"People are drowning in data,\" said Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, data scientist and author of Everybody Lies and Don't Trust Your Gut. \"This study highlights how the overwhelming amount of inputs a person gets in their average day -- internet searches, news alerts, unsolicited comments from friends -- frequently add up to more information than the brain is configured to handle. People are tempted to throw out the confusing, and sometimes conflicting, data and just do what feels right. But this can be a big mistake. It has been proven over and over again that our instincts can lead us astray and the best decision-making is done with a proper understanding of the relevant data. Finding a way to get a handle on the stream of data at their fingertips, to help businesses distinguish between the signal and the noise, is a crucial first step.\"\n\"When our drivers are racing at more than 200 miles per hour, they have to make critical decisions very quickly. The correct race strategy decisions like when to pit and which tires are best for the conditions on the track can mean the difference between winning and losing,\" said Christian Horner, Team Principal and CEO at Oracle Red Bull Racing. \"With Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, our team can take advantage of data by running billions of race strategy simulations during a Grand Prix weekend, ensuring that we make the best decisions in response to the performance of the cars, changes happening on the track, and the actions of our competitors during the race.\"\n\"As businesses expand to serve new customers in new ways, the number of data inputs they need to get the full picture expands too. Business leaders that make critical decisions about how to manage their companies ignore that data at their own risk,\" said T.K. Anand, executive vice president, Oracle Analytics. \"The hesitancy, distrust, and lack of understanding of data shown by this study indicates that many people and organizations need to rethink their approach to data and decision making. What people really need is to be able to connect data to insight to decision to action. With our span of connected cloud capabilities, ranging from foundational data management, to augmented and applied analytics, to our suite of operational applications, we are uniquely positioned to meet this need.\"\nThis global sample of 14,250 people were surveyed in January 2023.

      "text": "November 6, 2023\nMany business leaders inadvertently create a culture of fear at work\nA new poll of workplace leaders suggests there is an environment of unconscious fear in modern-day leadership, leading to toxic culture, stunted growth, performance and productivity, and decision inertia. The global study of 2,500 emerging leaders in corporate businesses by consultant Margot Faraci, claims that around one quarter (23 percent) of UK leaders are unconsciously creating an environment of fear with direct reports. Globally, this figure rises to one in three (30 percent), indicating a growing worldwide phenomenon of fearful leadership. Fearful leadership carries significant implications for team morale, performance, and overall well-being within organisations. It\u2019s often attributed to past experiences, creating an ongoing cycle of leadership driven by fear.\nAs a result, fearful leadership, whether conscious or unconscious, is costing UK businesses, and the wider UK economy, a \u00a32.2 billion drop in productivity and performance. Fearful leadership is also creating a culture of mistrust, as while fearful leaders are confident in themselves, half (48 percent) do not trust their direct reports to handle situations as they arise.\nFear-based leaders are defined as those that either always or often experience anxiety, micromanagement, imposter syndrome, anger, unwillingness to receive feedback, hesitancy to speak up, complacency and quiet quitting. These leaders lose 10 hours a week in productivity for their companies, equivalent to \u00a39,545 a year per leader, or \u00a32.2 billion annually.\nTo uncover unconscious fear in leadership, the study delved into leaders\u2019 behaviours and experiences. The results are alarming:\n- Nine in 10 (88 percent) are consistently fearful of being wrong or making mistakes\n- A further 82 percent consistently feel high pressure to demonstrate value\n- Two in three (67 percent) are hesitant to speak up with their own point of view\n- Nearly half (45 percent) are unwilling to give feedback to their direct reports or managers\n- One third (33 percent) regularly deliver or experience micromanagement\n- Well over a tenth (15 percent) regularly experience anxiety or nerves surrounding work\n- One in 20 (9 percent) regularly experience anger or frustration\nMargot Faraci comments \u201cThis reflects what I\u2019ve seen and experienced for decades in leadership: our fear of failure, our fear of being wrong or being outdone has devastating consequences for us personally and for our business performance. Fear shows up in various ways in leadership: being aggressive, avoiding difficult conversations, undermining others or staying small to be safe. All of these behaviors are damaging to the system and ourselves.\u201d\nFearful leadership is often rooted in inexperience and a lack of self-confidence, leading to increased stress, fatigue, and impaired decision-making. The consequences of fearful leadership on team morale, well-being, performance, and productivity are clear:\n- One third (33 percent) of fearful leaders state they regularly witness declines in employee and team performance\n- Two in five (38 percent) fearful leaders acknowledge there is a decrease in team morale\n- One in five (21 percent) suffer from strained relationships within their teams\n- A further fifth (21 percent) also say their ability to be creative is hindered.\nFaraci adds: \u201cFear is not the way to lead for performance and engagement. Fear makes leaders work harder than they would otherwise need to, and it has the same effect on everyone around them. Coming to work and performing sustainably is almost impossible in a fearful system.\n\u201cFearful Leaders often overcompensate by seeking to over-index compassion and sensitivity, thinking that will increase productivity. But, they don\u2019t actually demonstrate compassionate or sensitive behaviours, instead ramping up either micromanagement, or hands-off management.\n\u201cTo break this cycle requires self-awareness that defaulting to micromanagement and hands-off management squashes compassion and loses the benefits that true compassion can deliver. My question to fearful leaders is: do you love yourself enough to acknowledge your own fear and deal with it?\u201d\nCauses of fearful leadership\nThe study further reveals that over a third (36 percent) of fearful leaders attribute their behaviour to a lack of communication in the workplace, while 33 percent point to a lack of experience, and nearly half (45 percent) blame existing work culture. Worryingly, a quarter (23 percent) of fearful leaders admit to fearing displeasing their teams or higher-ups, with 25 percent feeling they are not key decision-makers and over one in 10 (12 percent) expressing a sense of hopelessness.\nFear-based leaders often draw from past experiences with poor managers to justify their actions, creating an ongoing cycle of fear within business leadership. Many of these emerging leaders have struggled to navigate their own experiences with largely hands-off and unavailable managers:\n- Half (45 percent) experienced micromanagement from their own managers\n- Three in four (77 percent) respondents say they feel a lack of trust from their leaders\n- Two thirds (67 percent) have a hesitancy to speak up in difficult situations\n- Three in five (59 percent) feel unhappy in their job\n- Over half (58 percent) of also feel resentment towards work\nWhile UK fearful leaders attribute their behaviour to past negative experiences, the study found US leaders often leverage fear as a means to drive results."

      "text": "HR professionals are more likely to have experienced imposter syndrome as research reveals the demographics of people most at risk of feeling like a fraud at work.\nA survey of 5,000 individuals by the training and apprenticeship provider Executive Development Network found that while imposter syndrome is common, with 50% of UK adults having been affected by it, some groups suffer significantly more than others.\nImposter syndrome refers to the experience of believing you are less competent than others perceive you to be. People with impostor syndrome often feel like they are \u201cfaking it\u201d leading to a fear of being found out or exposed as a fraud. They can display signs of perfectionism because of a fear of making mistakes and they can downplay success, attributing it to good luck or timing.\nImposter syndrome\nHow to tackle imposter syndrome and \u2018modern racism\u2019\nPandemic damaged young people\u2019s confidence and mental health\nMore than half of women (54%) feel they have experienced imposter syndrome, compared with just 38% of men. Those who identify as non-binary are worse affected, with 57% doubting their abilities in the workplace.\nThe research found that a person\u2019s sexual orientation also has an impact with bisexual (69%) and homosexual (57%) individuals being significantly more likely to experience imposter syndrome than average (50%).\nPerhaps less surprisingly, the older you are, the more likely you are to have strong self-belief. Gen Z (66%) and millennials (58%) were much more likely to have experienced imposter syndrome than Gen X (41%) and people in their sixties (25%).\nJill Whittaker, CEO of Executive Development Network, said: \u201cThere is a huge inclusivity issue here in the UK.
