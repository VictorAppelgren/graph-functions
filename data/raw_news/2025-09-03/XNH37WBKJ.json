  "content": "MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Ticket prices for next year\u2019s World Cup will range initially from $60 for group-stage matches to $6,730 for the final, but could change as soccer\u2019s top event adopts dynamic pricing for the first time.\n\nThe prices are up from a range of $25 to $475 for the 1994 tournament in the United States and for the U.S. dollar equivalent $69 to $1,607 when ticket details were announced for the 2022 tournament in Qatar.\n\n\u201cI think the message is \u2018Get your tickets early,\u2019 especially if you know where you will be, because you live in that city, or you\u2019re a fan of the three hosting nations, and then you know already when and where they will play,\u201d said Heimo Schirgi, the World Cup\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cSo that\u2019s the message: \u2018Get your tickets early,\u2019 because anything could happen.\u201d\n\nNext year\u2019s tournament runs from June 11 to July 19 and will be played at 11 sites in the U.S., three in Mexico and two in Canada. The tournament expanded from 32 nations to 48 and from 64 games to 104.\n\nThe initial draw period will be limited to Visa card holders and will run from 11 a.m. EDT on the opening day through 11 a.m. EDT on Sept. 19. Those picked to buy tickets will be notified starting Sept. 29 and will be given a timeslot to purchase starting Oct. 1. While tickets for all 104 matches are being put on sale, receiving a timeslot does not guarantee tickets will be available.\n\nSales will be capped at four tickets per person per match, with no person being able to purchase more than 40 for the totality of the tournament.\n\nHospitality packages have been sold since May. For the eight matches at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, including the final on July 19, prices range from $3,500 to $73,200 per person.\n\nFans can purchase tickets to follow a certain team, or purchase for a certain site. Dynamic pricing was also utilized for this year\u2019s Club World Cup, when tickets were cut from $473.90 to $13.40 for the Chelsea-Fluminense semifinal at MetLife Stadium.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s key to highlight FIFA\u2019s mission and FIFA\u2019s objective of providing funding, providing opportunities, providing growth to our sport across all the 211 member associations,\u201d Schirgi said. \u201cAnd as part of that mission, which we take very seriously, we\u2019re looking at optimizing the revenue, but also optimizing attendance in the stadium, right? So, it\u2019s always a balance between different factors.\u201d\n\nThirteen teams in the field have been determined. The U.S., Canada and Mexico all are assured World Cup spots as the host nations, while reigning champion Argentina with Lionel Messi and perennial power Brazil are among the teams that have already secured qualification.\n\nThe host nations will play all three of their group stage matches on home soil. The U.S. will open June 12 in Inglewood, California, then play June 19 in Seattle and again June 25 back in Inglewood. Canada will play June 12 in Toronto, then June 18 and June 24 in Vancouver. Mexico will play June 11 and June 24 in Mexico City, with a June 18 match in Guadalajara.",
