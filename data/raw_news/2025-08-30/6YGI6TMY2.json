  "content": "A black traveler filming herself an airport in Thailand was confronted by an irate fellow passenger who claimed she had been inadvertently caught on camera.\n\nThe run-in occurred at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, where American Casey Sharp was speaking into her camera before suddenly being interrupted by a white British woman.\n\n'Excuse me, we're in the background and you haven't got our permission to film us,' the unidentified woman is heard saying in the clip as she approaches Sharp, who was with her two children.\n\n'You're okay,' Sharp calmly responds, before the woman insists she delete the video.\n\n'I'm not deleting anything from my phone. You'll be okay,' Sharp shoots back, while the woman continues to complain.\n\nSharp tries to regain her composure but the fuming Brit refuses to back off, forcing the mother to again defend herself.\n\n'I got my permission, on my phone, in a public space,' Sharp says.\n\n'It's not public, you filmed us!' the woman replies.\n\n'I didn't film you. I filmed myself,' Sharp explains. 'You came into the background.'\n\nThe encounter persists for more than two more minutes, leaving an exasperated Sharp to post online asking 'So the Cincinnati brawl wasn't enough?', a reference to the viral street fight raised questions around race.\n\nAs Sharp speaks, the British woman can be heard saying 'it's absolutely disgusting' in background.\n\n'You don't like it, don't stand behind me. Simple. Stand somewhere else,' Sharp adds.\n\n'And I'm going to continue to film myself. Now I'm really going to film, for my safety.'\n\nThe British woman claims Sharp broke the law, despite it being legal to film in a public places in Thailand.\n\nShe even alerted security guards, who Sharp said in a follow-up video laughed off her complaints.\n\nCommenters were quick to point out that the British woman did not even appear visible until she charged into the frame.\n\n'Mind you, I didn't even notice them until they said something,' one commenter wrote.\n\n'Didn't even notice them until they started complaining,' another added.\n\n'As long as you're black, you're always going to have somebody in your business,' Sharp adds in the original clip, which has racked up tens of thousands of views on TikTok.\n\nDaily Mail has reached out to Sharp for comment.",

      "text": "Family of Cincinnati brawler makes shocking race allegations as suspect faces new charges over viral beatdown\nThe family of one of the Cincinnati brawlers claimed the only reason the fight has garnered so much attention was because the person punched in the face is a white woman.\nJermaine Matthews, 39, and Montianez Merriweather, 34, were initially charged with aggravated riot and assault after the massive brawl in the streets of Cincinnati, Ohio, went viral this week.\nMatthews, however, was hit with three more charges on Thursday - two felonious assault and one assault charge.\nOutside of court, two relatives of Merriweather told WLWT that the race of the victims had catapulted the case to national attention.\n'If it was an African American woman who got knocked out... We wouldn't have been going through all this,' one of the women said.\nAnother woman, believed to be Merriweather's mother Clarissa, said her son is an honor roll student with 'a biracial child' as she denied he was racist.\n'He's not a racist,' she said. 'It wasn't like they're thugs... these Russians was walking down the street and on the video he said \"you wanna mess with these Russians?\"'\n'He smacked the first guy... my child is in school, he has five kids, he's on the B honor roll in school.'\nTwo men and a woman were charged over their involvement as horror images emerged of a female victim with black eyes and a swollen, bruised face.\nOne of the suspects, 39-year-old Jermaine Matthews, was initially charged with aggravated riot and assault, but was slapped with three more charges on Thursday, two felonious assault charges and one assault charge\nExtraordinary vision went viral this week showing the massive brawl in the streets of Cincinnati, Ohio, on Friday night\nOutside of court on Thursday, two relatives of fellow suspect, 34-year-old Montianez Merriweather, said the race of the suspects and victims had catapulted the case to national attention\nPolice have described Merriweather as the 'catalyst' for the alleged 'coordinated attack.'\nDekyra Vernon, 24, has also been charged.\nMatthews' attorney Brandon Fox also indicated there were other racial elements at play during the brawl.\n'That is the victim that is seen running down the street screaming racial slurs, the n word,' he said, referring to video of the incident.\nIn shocking footage of the fight, a man in a white t-shirt was shoved to the ground and beaten by two men as other members of the crowd jeered and joined in.\nThe gang beat the man for nearly a minute as he lay in the middle of the street, seemingly stepping on his head multiple times.\nWhen the barrage of attacks temporarily stopped, he was seen attempting to stand - but immediately fell over in apparent disorientation. One attacker yelled out 'my man's drunk'.\nJermaine Matthews is facing charges of aggravated riot and assault in connection with the brawl\nDekyra Vernon, 24, (left) and Montianez Merriweather, 34, (right) were also taken into custody in connection with the melee\nA woman in a black dress rushed to his aid, but was attacked by the crowd, suffering two blows to the face.\nThe impact caused her to fall, with her head slamming onto the pavement. Blood spewed from her mouth.\nDisturbing new images emerged on Thursday showing the severe injuries that woman sustained in the attack.\nRepublican state Senator Bernie Moreno said in a post on X that the woman, known publicly only as Holly, had given him permission to share the damning pictures of her injuries.\nBoth sides of her face were extremely bruised following the assault, with her right eye a dark shade of purple and almost closed over due to the swelling.\nHer bottom lip was also cut open slightly, with dark bruises seen around her neck and upper torso.\nMoreno said: 'This is Holly. She wanted to have a nice evening out with friends. Instead, she got this. Holly gave me permission to release the photos so that others will never suffer what she did. We need and deserve change.'\nBoth sides of Holly's face were extremely bruised following the assault, with her right eye a dark shade of purple and almost closed over due to the swelling\nThe woman, known only as Holly, is seen here on the ground following the horrific attack\nSearch warrants have been issued for two other unidentified people accused of jumping into the shocking melee.\nCincinnati Chief of Police Teresa Theetge said during a press conference on Monday that around 100 people descended on the brawl, but only one called 911.\n'That is unacceptable to not call the police,' she said. 'Traffic was horrendous. People saw this. They were fighting in front of traffic. Why didn't people call us?'\nTheetge added in her press conference that anyone involved in the fight should turn themselves in, and warned that more charges may follow.\n'Anyone who put their hands on another individual during this incident in an attempt to cause harm will face consequences,' she said.\n'I don't care which side of the incident or the fight they were on.'\nVice President JD Vance waded in on the clip captured in his home state on Monday, saying anybody involved should be thrown in prison.\nHe said: 'I don't know the full context, but the one part that I saw that was really gruesome is you had a grown man who sucker punched a middle-age woman.\n'That person ought to go to jail for a very long time - and frankly, he's lucky there weren't some better people around because they would've handled it themselves.\n'We have got to make great American cities safe again for families and children, the only way to destroy that street violence is to take the thugs who engage in that violence and throw their asses in prison.'"
