  "title": "Trump Is Doubling Down on Sanctions. Putin Is Laughing All the Way to Alaska.",
  "description": "There is something Putin cares about more than money.",
  "content": "Donald Trump wants the war in Ukraine to end. Volodymyr Zelensky wants the war in Ukraine to end. Many other presidents and prime ministers want the war to end. Vladimir Putin is not one of those presidents. The war in Ukraine has become the political, psychological and economic center of Putin\u2019s regime.\n\nThat basic asymmetry would seem to doom any attempt at a negotiated peace \u2014 it is, in fact, the main reason no meaningful peace negotiations have occurred in the three and a half years since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Trump thinks he has a solution, though. He says he intends to use his negotiating prowess and keep ratcheting up economic pressure until Putin has no choice but to stop the fighting.\n\nBetween the bombastic social media posts, the shifting deadlines, the erratic announcements \u2014 one day a White House official says Trump will meet with Putin only after Putin meets with Zelensky, another day Trump drops the requirement \u2014 it\u2019s easy to overlook the fact that Trump\u2019s policy toward Russia largely follows the same failed strategy employed by the Biden administration, the first Trump administration and the Obama administration before that. For more than a decade, the United States has responded to Russian aggression by threatening and gradually imposing economic sanctions. That some of Trump\u2019s sanctions take the form of tariffs doesn\u2019t alter the nature of the policy.\n\nThe conventional theory behind sanctions is that economic pressure destabilizes regimes, possibly forcing the leader to change course. In one scenario, widespread hardship \u2014 unemployment, inflation, shortages \u2014 leads to popular discontent, even unrest. In another, a shrinking economy and loss of access to foreign markets anger the elites, who stage a palace coup or at least compel the leader to change direction.",
