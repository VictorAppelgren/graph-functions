      "summary": "Trump’s broad reciprocal tariffs have raised import duties to about 18%, generating roughly $3 trillion in revenue over a decade but also dampening growth to around 1.5% this year. The tariffs are expected to keep inflation above 3% this fall, prompting a cautious Fed that may lower rates but faces limits from rising Treasury yields and a high deficit. Businesses face supply‑chain disruptions and higher costs, but the economy is projected to rebound to 2% growth by 2026 without a recession. Overall, the tariffs create a one‑time adjustment period as the U.S. adapts to protectionist trade policy.",
