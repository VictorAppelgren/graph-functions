  "content": "5 More Affordable Alternatives To The Porsche Cayenne GTS\n\nPorsche has a knack for spinning off trim levels that can almost stand on their own as separate models, and the Cayenne is no exception. The Autobahn-bred SUV that horrified sports car purists when it debuted in 2002 quickly became the company's best-selling model line, diversifying into multiple models along the way. The GTS sits higher up in the Cayenne hierarchy, above the base model and S variants, but below the Cayenne Turbo GT Coupe and the Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid. Despite not having the word turbo in its name, the Cayenne GTS actually is a turbocharged beast, sporting a 493-horsepower, twin-turbo V8. Porsche claims a 0 to 60 mph time of 4.4 seconds and a 171 mph top speed, delivered with the smooth power of eight cylinders cranking out 486 lb-ft of torque. When one of our reviewers got her first drive of the 2025 Porsche Cayenne GTS last year, its fusion of power with the practicality of an all-wheel drive SUV won her over from her preference for Porsche's Cayman GTS sports car. The only drawback to the Cayenne GTS? It isn't cheap. While it doesn't hit the stratospheric $200,000+ price range of its GT Turbo sibling, Porsche's website displays a starting price of $129,900 (destination charge: $2,750) for the GTS. Some worthy competitors can offer equal or better performance for substantially less cash, in some cases. Let's take a look at five of the best.\n\nThe Audi SQ8 is getting up there in years, having debuted in its current form 7 years ago, but in terms of power, performance, and driving thrills, it still holds up very well. At a $98,895 ($1,295 destination charge) base price, it also undercuts the Cayenne GTS's base price by more than 30 grand. It offers a fastback profile that's similar to the Cayenne GTS Coupe \u2014 although take note that even the coupe-style Cayenne and the SQ8 both have four doors \u2014 and it offers something else that can be found in the Cayenne GTS: a twin-turbo V8. The SQ8's V8 produces an even 500 horsepower and 568 lb-ft of torque, both exceeding the GTS's output. With that power channeled to all four wheels, the SQ8 can hit 60 mph in only 3.9 seconds on its way to a top speed of 155 mph. It handles very well, too, with lateral acceleration of 1.0 g despite its 5,269-pound curb weight, which is a few hundred pounds heavier than the Cayenne GTS's 4,956 pounds. The extra heft reflects the SQ8's slightly larger size: its 196.6-inch length and 117.9-inch wheelbase each exceed the Cayenne's by a few inches. The extra size and weight get you a spacious and comfortable passenger cabin befitting Audi's luxury image. Our review of the 2024 version of the Audi SQ8 found its price, specs, and V8 performance make it a future classic.\n\nOne of Cayenne GTS's competitors comes from within its own family, and as is often the case with siblings, the rivalry is fierce. While the Cayenne E-Hybrid is available in a completely bonkers, 729-horsepower Turbo model, even the base E-Hybrid overachieves with 463 horsepower at $99,195. But stepping up to the S trim nets you 512 horses for $107,095 (destination charge: $2,750), which is more power for substantially less money than the Cayenne GTS. Therefore, this S trim level is the one we recommend. The Cayenne S E-Hybrid exactly matches the Cayenne GTS from 0-60 mph with a time of 4.4 seconds. Plus, since the Cayenne S E-Hybrid is a PHEV, or a plug-in hybrid, it can travel approximately 20 miles on battery power alone. Overall, it achieves 52 miles per gallon equivalent when the battery is fully charged, making it a sensible way to go fast. Of course, its dimensions are identical to its Cayenne GTS sibling, although its battery adds mass, bringing the curb weight to 5,672 pounds. Still, the extra power compensates for the weight.\n\nThe 2025 Mercedes-AMG GLE-Class offers the GLE53 with 429 horsepower and the GLE63 with 603 horsepower, but to undercut the Cayenne GTS's price, you'll need to choose the GLE53 and its $90,350 ($1,150 destination charge) base price. You won't be sacrificing much, though, as the GLE53 runs from 0 to 60 in 4.4 seconds \u2014 the same as the Cayenne GTS. It achieves this impressive performance with a 3.0-liter, turbocharged inline six-cylinder augmented with a 48-volt electric charge, making the GLE53's powertrain a mild hybrid system. As an AMG product, every aspect of the SUV's performance has been enhanced. An air-bag suspension system with active anti-roll bars gives the GLE53 sports-car handling with no sacrifice in ride comfort. It won't spill your drinks on a coffee run, yet selectable drive modes offer a choice of Sport or Sport Plus modes for carving up twisty roads. A longer wheelbase might contribute to the GLE53's smooth ride, since it features a 117.9-inch wheelbase \u2014 nearly 4 inches longer than the Cayenne GTS \u2014 in an SUV with an overall length that's nearly identical to the Porsche at 194.4 inches. This contributes to a cabin that's spacious enough for an optional third row of seats despite being a midsize SUV, but only in the squareback body style; the coupe model is strictly a two-row affair, like the Cayenne.\n\nWhen the Maserati Grecale Trofeo debuted in 2023, a reviewer for Motor1.com declared it the best Maserati to come along in a decade. In 2025, the $117,500 ($1,495 destination charge) Grecale Trofeo gets you a 523-horsepower, turbocharged V6, a 3.6-second 0-60 time, and a 177 mph top speed. But as with many Italian cars, the specs may be impressive, but they take a back seat to the emotional effect of driving one. To begin with, the Grecale Trofeo stands out for its looks. To the extent that an SUV can have voluptuous curves, this one does, from its aggressive grille (complete with Maserati trident) to its muscular rear quarter panels. This vehicle looks like an Italian sports car in SUV form. The interior is a mix of luxurious leather and high-tech carbon-fiber trim. The Grecale Trofeo is technically considered a compact SUV, and our review of the 2024 Grecale Trofeo compared it to the Cayenne's little brother, the Porsche Macan. Yet the Grecale's dimensions are quite similar to the Cayenne. Its overall length is about 3 inches shorter at 191.3 inches, but its wheelbase is almost identical at 114.2 inches, perhaps contributing to the Grecale's nearly perfect proportions. It's the lightweight on our list. At only 4,650 pounds, it's ideal for an Italian sportster.\n\nHear us out on this one: Yes, the Rivian R1S is all-electric. And yes, that means it lacks the visceral growl that the Cayenne GTS's twin-turbo V8 delivers. Yet in terms of sheer performance, it blows the doors off almost everything else on the road in its 665-horsepower Performance Dual-Motor version. In fact, it gets you to 60 mph in just 3.8 seconds. Yet even configured with dual motors, the price starts at $77,700 ($1,800 destination charge), giving you the best bang for the buck on this list, by a lot. But if ultimate speed is your goal, you don't have to stop there. There's an 850-horsepower Tri-Motor version and a 1,050-horsepower Quad-Motor edition. These have 0-60 times of 2.8 seconds and less than 2.5 seconds, respectively. Top speed is 130 mph, but that's strictly due to a limiter. And even the most expensive trim level starts at $107,700. The R1S is the longest vehicle on this list at 200.8 inches, with a very generous 121.1-inch wheelbase. In fact, it's a three-row SUV, but we felt it belonged on this list because its nearly insane performance specs definitely qualify it as a high-performance competitor for the Cayenne GTS. Plus, while you might expect an SUV from a company that only delivered its first vehicles in 2021 to be a bit crude and unpolished, the interior is actually quite sophisticated and luxurious. Plus, Rivian trucks have interesting features like 1,000-lumen flashlights hidden in the driver's door.\n\nThe Cayenne is a midsize, five-passenger SUV whose bottom-line performance specs we've already examined above. Its total length is just a hair over 194 inches with a 114-inch wheelbase. For our comparison, we stuck to SUVs that are fairly close to it in size, with total lengths and wheelbases that are no more than 7 inches greater than those of the GTS. This rules out some larger SUVs like the 203.6-inch BMW X7. We also limited our comparison to two-row SUVs (with one exception), reasoning that three-row SUVs are more focused on transporting extra passengers than generating top performance. This would also rule out the BMW X7, as well as the Audi SQ7, although one of the SQ7's stablemates did make the cut. Plus, since the Cayenne GTS runs from 0 to 60 in 4.4 seconds, we wanted our SUVs to have 0-60 times under 4.5 seconds. This ruled out possible competitors like the BMW X6 xDrive40i and its 5.2-second time. Finally, the base price of the recommended trim level must noticeably undercut the GTS's base price of $129,900. This ruled out several fine but pricey high-performance SUVs. Yet the models that made our list are hardly penalty boxes, and any one of these would be a joy to take out on a twisty road or to dinner in the city.",

      "text": "2025 Porsche Cayenne GTS Targets The Sports SUV Sweet Spot With Twin-Turbo V8 Engine\nIt's been a year since Porsche gave a thorough mid-cycle update for its 2024 model year Porsche Cayenne. Perhaps the most important addition in the last update was the return of the V8 engine on the Cayenne S in place of the older 2.9-liter twin-turbo V6 engine. Porsche also increased the power output of the V6 engine by 13 hp while producing 50 Nm of additional torque over the outgoing models.\nOther updates included subtle exterior styling changes and comprehensive changes to the interiors, including a redesigned dashboard with a new 12.6-inch gauge cluster. Following this update, the entire Cayenne lineup constituted five different models: the standard Cayenne, the Cayenne E-Hybrid, the Cayenne S, the Cayenne S E-Hybrid, and the Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid.\nOne year since the last update, Porsche has announced the addition of new Cayenne GTS models to the Cayenne lineup. According to the company, this updated GTS lineup consists of driver-focused vehicles with a more powerful V8 engine and enhanced standard equipment levels. While the more powerful engine is a crucial change, Porsche claims that these cars have been built focusing on road performance. Every aspect of the car, from the design elements and engine to the suspension setup, is tuned for comfort and practicality.\nThe 2025 Porsche Cayenne GTS: What's new?\nThe most significant change to the 2025 Porsche Cayenne GTS is the updated 4.0 liter, twin-turbo engine, which has received significant upgrades compared to its predecessors. On the 2025 Cayenne GTS, this engine makes 493 horsepower (40 more than its predecessor) and 487 lb.-ft of torque (30 lb.-ft more than its predecessor). The car also gets Porsche's Tiptronic S automatic transmission, which now claims quicker gear shift times, enabling faster acceleration. The Porsche GTS now claims a 0-60 mph time of just 4.2 seconds and has a top speed of 171 mph.\nPorsche has made extensive modifications to the suspension setup of the Cayenne GTS. The car now features an air suspension exclusively fine-tuned for the GTS model. This suspension setup features an adaptive damper system and offers the company's proprietary Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus System, which lets customers reduce the ride height by up to 10mm.\nThe Porsche Cayenne GTS has several distinctive design elements to make it stand out among other Cayennes. These include distinctive rocker panels, window surrounds, and wheel arch extensions. The car also gets the GTS model designation on the door and at the rear. Porsche has also changed the color of the tip of the exhaust system, which now comes in a dark bronze tone, as opposed to the black color that the older GTS versions came with. All 2025 Porsche Cayenne GTS models get 21-inch RS Spyder wheels.\nAnother distinctive design element is the adaptive rear spoiler, offered on the Cayenne GTS Coupe models. These models also get an optional Sport Exhaust System as well.\n2025 Porsche Cayenne GTS: Other interesting bits, pricing and availability\nOther features of the 2025 Porsche Cayenne GTS that are worth mentioning include incorporating the updated Porsche Driver Experience Suite, which includes a curved instrument cluster and an optional passenger display. The car also gets a high-end Bose surround sound audio system and supports ambient lighting.\nThose interested in the Cayenne GTS Coupe might want to know that this variant can be ordered with a Sport Exhaust System. Also included are Lightweight Sport Packages, which allow users to add a lightweight roof, a rear diffuser made of carbon fiber, and reduced sound insulation. These packages can also help buyers reduce the overall weight of the car by a significant 55 pounds.\nWhile the company has yet to confirm the availability dates, we know that customers can order 2025 Porsche Cayenne models in the next few weeks. Porsche has confirmed that these models are expected to reach Porsche Centers across the U.S. by fall 2024. As for pricing, the 2025 Porsche Cayenne GTS has an MSRP of $124,900. Opting for the Coupe variant will cost you slightly more, thanks to its MSRP of $129,500. As always, this pricing excludes tax, registration, and dealer charges."

      "text": "2024 Audi SQ8 Review: V8 Star Sounds Like A Future Classic\nFor all that electric vehicles charm with their smooth, near-silent running, and their waves of instant torque, it only takes thumbing the Start/Stop button in the Audi SQ8 to understand the lingering appeal of a big gas engine. Amid the burble of the 4.0-liter V8, sensible thoughts of things like fuel economy evaporate.\nOn paper, certainly, you could question the point of the SQ8. Audi's feistier version of the Q8 SUV makes sense in isolation, but then you remember that the SQ7 also exists. It has the same V8 gas engine, tuned for the same horsepower and torque, plus a third row of seats. However, it starts almost $7,000 less than the $96,600 (plus $1,195 destination) of this 2024 SQ8 (which Audi says is effectively the same as a 2025 model year example, bar a $1,000 price increase).\nIt's testament to the strength of the SUV segment, then \u2014 and to the stylish allure of the Q8 family specifically \u2014 that Audi manages to carve out spaces for both models. Yes, they might share a platform and an engine, but a combination of styling decisions, equipment, and cunning market positioning leaves the SQ8 feeling like far more than simply a family SUV playing luxury dress-up.\nSquared-off style looks the part\nIt's not a small SUV, though the steep rake of the rear glass leaves the SQ8 looking more compact than its actual footprint. Audi's Ascari Blue paint ($595) only looks more bold against the SQ8's matte silver grille surround, vent trim, side mirror caps, and other detailing. I'm a fan of the 22-inch bi-color wheels, too \u2014 standard fit, no less \u2014 which strike a simplified stance compared to the fiddly multispokes popular elsewhere in the segment.\nThe HD Matrix-design LED headlamps with laser-light, plus the OLED taillights, are not only part of the $7,000 Prestige package (that also includes dual-pane acoustic side glass and power soft-close doors) but a reminder that the U.S. still misses out on the fancier adaptive lighting that drivers elsewhere in the world have enjoyed for some time, now. A power tailgate is standard.\nThere's a practicality sacrifice, of course, for the Audi's roofline. The SQ8 falls short of the maximum trunk space that an SQ7 offers \u2014 there's 30.5 cu-ft with the rear seats up, expanding to 60.7 cu-ft with them down \u2014 and there's no third row of seats. Second row headroom is reduced by less than an inch, however.\nA familiar - though not very exciting - interior\nInside, things are familiar. Audi lifts its sportier SUV with carbon twill dashboard inlays and metal trim, and it's all sturdy and feels high-quality, but there's no huge step from other high-end models from the automaker. Rotor Gray leather sport seats with diamond quilting are standard, heated and with a matching heated steering wheel. They're comfortable, if somewhat sober; even Audi's \"red\" hide is pretty subdued. Ventilation for the front seats, and heating for the rear, come in that Prestige package, along with a head-up display.\nBang & Olufsen audio, quad-zone climate control, a panoramic sunroof, wireless phone charging, and Audi's MMI Navigation plus infotainment system \u2014 spread over dual touchscreens with weird haptic feedback that demands a firmer press than you expect, and paired with the virtual cockpit driver display \u2014 are standard.\nSo, too, are front and rear parking sensors and a 360-degree camera, along with safety features like blind spot and rear cross-traffic warnings, forward collision warnings and avoidance assistance, and lane-departure warnings. The Prestige package adds Remote Park Assist Plus \u2014 allowing you to navigate the SQ8 in and out of parking spaces from your phone, outside of the SUV \u2014 and Intersection Assist.\nAudi's extras didn't stop there, though. $5,000 upgrades the audio to Bang & Olufsen's Advanced 3D version; $4,350 gets the Luxury package, most notably adding front seat massage and spreading the leather trim across the dashboard, upper doors, and armrests. I can see the appeal of both, though a little more gimmicky is the $2,500 Night Vision Assistant. After all, if you tap the SQ8's most obvious party tricks, you'll want to keep your eyes on the road, not the dashboard display.\nPlenty of power from Audi's V8\nGetting things going is a 4.0-liter V8 gas engine, with a more-than-healthy 500 horsepower and 568 lb-ft of torque. Routed through an eight-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission to standard Quattro all-wheel drive, it's sufficient for a 4.0 second 0-60 mph time, Audi says (and I suspect they're being conservative).\nThat's not enough to make it the fastest Q8 variant, mind. Though a second and a half swifter than the regular Q8 (which has, admittedly, a mere 335 horses to play with), the RS Q8 coaxes 591 hp out of its version of the V8. That's a nice uptick (and you pay $125,800 plus destination for the privilege) but it only trims three-tenths of a second from that 0-60 time.\nThe SQ8 is no slouch, then, surging forward in Dynamic mode with eagerness and a charmingly throaty snarl. Standard all-wheel steering and sport adaptive air suspension help further shrink any sense of bulk, not to mention offering a welcome spread of ride comfort and ride height. Hard to imagine many tapping the \"allroad\" option and roaming the wilds in their sporty Audi, but the SQ8's maximum 8.3-inches of ground clearance suggests it's your willingness to risk the nice wheels, more than the SUV's specs, which might hold you back.\nThe one package you really, really want\nThe S sport package \u2014 adding a further $6,000 to your grand total, which in the case of this particular 2024 SQ8 landed at a hefty $123,990 including destination \u2014 isn't cheap, but I'd sacrifice the fancier audio system and night vision to pay for it. In addition to red-painted brake calipers, it incudes active roll stabilization and a sport rear differential. The former improves handling by selectively splitting or locking the axle stabilizers, cutting the body roll you'd usually expect to see in the corners. Instead, the Audi sails around turns with a serene poise.\nAs for the sport rear differential, that allows the SQ8 to shift torque between the left and right wheels. In the corners, it can route more power to the outside wheel \u2014 improving traction and helping avoid understeer \u2014 or to the inside wheel to combat oversteer.\nThey're not systems unique to the SQ8 \u2014 or to Audi in general \u2014 but there's a reason they've become popular tech on SUVs with sporting pretensions. By their nature, taller and heavier vehicles aren't generally happiest when changing direction, particularly when being pushed hard. Features like active roll stabilization won't turn the SQ8 into a traditional sports car, which have the laws of physics in their corner, but they'll make a tangible difference to most drivers pushing hard on public roads.\n2024 Audi SQ8 Verdict\nIs the sports car going to be more fun, overall? Certainly, but that's no great consolation when you need to transport the whole family plus luggage. There's a reason, after all, why SUVs are so popular: the Q8 \u2014 and the SQ8 atop that \u2014 garnishes that practicality with the sort of high-end cabin comforts that traditionally you'd have looked to an A6 or A8 sedan for. An R8 would be more fun on the track, but even Audi's notoriously daily-driver-friendly coupe lacked the all-rounder talents the SQ8 delivers in spades.\nThe truth of the matter is that the shape of modern performance and luxury have changed. A 6,000 pound SUV that charms with its pace and soundtrack, flatters with its still-comfortable ride, and can \u2014 if you're reasonably sensible \u2014 hit 21 mpg on the highway (or a thirstier 15 mpg in the city, for a total of 17 mpg combined) may not please purists, but as a reflection of the market you can't really argue.\nA little more design drama in the cabin wouldn't go amiss, and some extra snorts and bellows from the exhausts would help assuage guilt at spending six-figures on a V8 engine. More fundamental peril no longer waits in the wings, meanwhile, but instead stalks across the dealership forecourt: an SQ8 e-tron is cheaper, very nearly as fast, and does fascinating things with its trio of electric motors. For the SQ8 the writing may be on the wall, then, but perhaps for the sake of eight cylinders we can ignore it a little longer."

      "text": "2025 Porsche Cayenne GTS First Drive: The SUV Sweet Spot For Price And Power\nI've always said that when I win the lottery I'm going straight to the Porsche dealership. The Cayman GTS has long been my jam, but after spending some time behind the wheel of the 2025 Cayenne GTS, I've come to learn that you don't have to sacrifice practicality for a fun time behind the wheel. This mid-size luxury SUV has room for five and excels on twisty back roads, while still providing a comfortable ride on traffic-heavy commutes.\nGTS stands for Gran Turismo Sport. Available in both standard and coupe forms, think of it as a combination of the cushy Cayenne S and top bonkers Turbo GT trims. There are a few visual cues that point to its performance soul. The exterior gets a unique front fascia with larger air intakes for the twin turbo V8 powerplant. The headlamps are tinted just a bit, and I'm digging the bronze exhaust tips in the rear. Anthracite Grey 21-inch wheels are standard, but my tester has slightly larger 22-inch shoes wrapped in Pirelli P Zero rubber.\nScreens, screens, and all of the screens\nInside I'm treated to no fewer than three large screens across the dash. The curved 12.6-inch digital gauge cluster is standard and reconfigurable. The Porsche Communication Management system occupies the center of the dash, measuring 12.3 inches. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are here and this is what I use during my drive to access things like navigation and Spotify, as my tester has come straight from Germany and many US features are not active.\nStill, the menus are well-organized and the screen quick to respond to inputs. The right seat gets an optional 10.9-inch screen and it's great. As a passenger I love having easy access to the navigation and audio controls, allowing the driver to keep their eyes on the road. Heck, the passenger can even record lap times from the right seat.\nWhile many controls are accessed through the screen, the HVAC still has physical buttons for a quick click up or down to control the dual-zone climate control. The Cayenne GTS features a physical knob for the volume control as well, so the tunes are always easily managed. There are four USB-C ports in the cabin and I love the cooled wireless charging compartment. My phone always seems to heat to Hades when using inductive charging, and this little cubby ensures it stays cool and functional.\nThe standard Race-Tex is pretty darn good\nSliding behind the wheel in the morning, I nestle my behind into the standard 8-way power-adjustable seats. They come heated for free, but you can also option up ventilation and even massage. You can pay more for a full-leather interior but the Race-Tex micro-suede fabric that is standard is way better. It has a great tactile feel and, later in the day when I get to sample the 18-way sport seats, I find that my butt stays put when the Race-Tex is combined with the adjustable side bolsters.\nSpeaking of options, you can pretty much customize the interior of your Cayenne to your heart's delight. You want carbon fiber trim? No problem! What about orange leather grab handles? Yes, that's possible. I don't know why, but it's possible. Illuminated black aluminum door sill guards? Ja woll! You can even customize your floor mats, get a carbon fiber cover for the car's instruction manual, and add a Porsche car seat for your little one. None of it comes cheaply, of course, but the Cayenne is a six-figure car. What's another $1,000 for a bespoke leather key fob?\nA rear end we can all love\nHowever, if you're here for performance you can skip all the fussy bits and get right to the driving. I'm a fan of electrified powertrains but hot damn if this V8 doesn't satisfy some kind of primal animal hidden deep in my subconscious. I've got 493 ponies under my right foot, complemented by 486 pound-feet of torque. An 8-speed automatic transmission puts the power down to all four wheels and 60 miles per hour comes up in 4.2 seconds. Sure, the top spec Turbo GT coupe can do it in a smidge over three seconds, but it starts at over $200,000 and that is definitely some tech bro money that I don't have.\nPlus, driving isn't just about straight line speed, and the GTS has plenty of bits from the GT that make it a blast and a half to sling around a curvy road. The steering knuckles allow for more negative camber in the front wheels, which results in quicker, tighter turn-in. There are also stiffer roll bars front and rear, as well as a new application of the Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) system to control vertical and lateral movements. The all-wheel drive system in the Cayenne also has more rear-wheel drive bias than in previous years.\nThe result of all this is a car that loves to turn, despite its nearly 5,000-pound curb weight. On the winding roads of north Georgia, decreasing radius turns are no problem for this crossover. If I find I'm not on the right line, a bit of throttle gets the rear to rotate just enough to bring the Cayenne around. Although the steering ratio isn't any quicker than other trims, the steering wheel is smaller so it feels quite quick indeed.\nPeep those yellow calipers\nI alternate between Sport and Sport Plus modes on these roads to eke out the most performance. In each, throttle response is more immediate, the dampers stiffer, and the steering gets more heft. These roads feature undulations in the pavement just before a few tight turns. The PASM keeps the car controlled through these imperfections so I don't have to wait for the Cayenne to settle before I add my steering inputs.\nSo too goes the transmission. There are paddle shifters here which are fun, but it's not like I can shift any faster than the computer can. It will downshift on its own on braking\u2013the carbon ceramic brakes here are touchy but excellent\u2013ensuring I have access to the power as a squeeze on the throttle out of the turn. Lather, rinse, repeat.\nIf you really want to get into the jazz, the coupe will allow you to simplify and add lightness with one of three Lightweight packages. You'll spend up to $11,000 to shave up to 55 pounds off the chassis. I've always said the easiest way to shed weight is to get divorced, but if you're happy with your partner and like driving, one of these packages might be worth it to you.\nHowever, all good things must end as I head back to the hotel. I've had my GT fun, now it's time for the comfy S features to take center stage. Normal mode tones everything down a notch or two. The throttle is muted, the transmission more eager to stay away from the higher rpms. However, I can still hear that great V8 burble and there is still more than enough grunt to whip around slower-moving cars on the highway. My only wish is for the optional massaging seats.\nI could fit so many 12-packs of Diet Dr Pepper back here\nYou won't get a ton of standard safety features on the Cayenne GTS. Parking sensors, forward collision warning and blind spot monitoring are all standard but adaptive cruise control and other higher-tech features are all extra. Porsche does offer a Night Vision Assist but my drive was in the day. There is no hands-free/eyes-up drive assistant but Porsche says its InnoDrive hands-on system will keep the car in its lane and look ahead a few miles to prepare for traffic incidents. However, that feature is not active on my German-spec car.\nStill, I have to comment on the placement of the adaptive cruise control...um...controls. Instead of being on the steering wheel, Porsche puts them on a stalk on the lower left hand quadrant of the steering column. I'm sure if I owned the car I'd quickly memorize the movement sequence needed to set everything up, but trying to absorb the pictographs while driving and forcing my old lady eyes to focus on the small font is always a chore. Pro tip: figure out that stalk before you hit the road.\nI am bummed that the GTS trim can't be purchased with the Off Road package, but this is, after all, a trim focused on pavement performance. Still, the GTS does get an off-road mode that raises the suspension to just over nine inches. Further, the Cayenne has a fair amount of utility as well. It can tow over 7,700 pounds as long as the trailer has its own brakes, and has a maximum payload of 1,415 pounds. Behind the rear seats is about 26 cubic feet of space, expanding to 60 cubes with the second row folded. Keep in mind, however, the coupe suffers just a bit here with its sloping roofline. Payload is reduced by about 100 pounds and cargo space takes a small hit as well.\n2025 Porsche Cayenne GTS Verdict\nNeither Porsche nor the EPA have released any fuel economy numbers, but at the end of my day I saw just over 16 miles per gallon on the car's computer. This was through a variety of driving scenarios including aggressive accelerations, stop-and-go traffic, and easy cruising at the speed limit.\nWhile the base Cayenne starts at under $85,000, you'll have to add nearly $2,000 for delivery. The GTS model starts at $124,900 plus delivery and the coupe model is at $129,500. With the option-heavy configurator it's easy to add tens of thousands of dollars to that bottom line, so choose wisely. Is paying six figures for a car just a little bit crazy? Absolutely! But you'll get an SUV that not only looks great, but its split-personality means it's just at home commuting to work as it is carving corners."

      "text": "The 2023 Grecale Trofeo Is The Best Maserati In A Decade\nWhen a 523-horsepower V6 sounds better than a Ferrari-derived V8, you know you\u2019re onto something.\nThe last time I got behind the wheel of a Maserati, the pandemic was in full swing. The automaker invited me to Willow Springs for a few laps of its freshly minted Trofeo lineup \u2013 the Levante, Ghibli, and Quattroporte. I was expecting to heap breathless praise onto the Ferrari-derived, twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V8 resting under the hood, but it wasn\u2019t to be.\nWithout the Roma-chic flat-plane crank and equal-length exhausts, the Trofeo trio was sedate, tame, and almost boring. Detracting from the experience was a cabin that looked (and smelled) like it had been plucked from Chrysler\u2019s clearance rack \u2013 especially in the Ghibli. Instead of Osteria di Modena Rossi and Call Me By Your Name, I got Olive Garden and Everybody Loves Raymond.\nYou can imagine my skepticism, then, when Maserati dropped a Grecale Trofeo on my driveway. Not only had I been burned in the past with high expectations, but this new Trident didn\u2019t even have that Ferrari DNA to fall back on. Insteadthere\u2019s a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 that comes from the MC20 sports car \u2013 although that\u2019s an admittedly brilliant machine, a V6-powered crossover doesn\u2019t exactly inspire a lot of lust. Happily, I was as wrong about the Grecale Trofeo as I was about its Ghibli sibling.\n| Quick Stats | 2023 Maserati Grecale Trofeo |\n| Engine | Twin-Turbo 3.0-Liter V6 |\n| Output | 523 Horsepower / 457 Pound-Feet |\n| Transmission | Eight-Speed Automatic |\n| 0-60 | 3.6 Seconds |\n| Price As Tested | $136,795 |\n| On Sale | Now |\nGallery: 2023 Maserati Grecale Trofeo Review\nModenese Supermodel\nIt\u2019s hard to deny that the Grecale\u2019s one hell of a looker. The upturned daylight opening (borrowed from the first- and fifth-generation Quattroporte) adds a dash of Italianate, mid-century style to the modern-crossover proportions. Meanwhile, the sloping hood, peaked fenders, and bottom-feeder grille look as fabulous here as they do on everything from the Mistral to the latest Gran Turismo. And if you squint, you\u2019ll see shades of the not-for-USA 3200GT in the boomerang-shaped taillight accents.\nAll those heritage design cues wouldn\u2019t count for much if the Grecale didn\u2019t already have an appealing form factor, but apart from the longish front overhang, it\u2019s just about perfect. The stance is low and wide, with a long wheelbase and color-matched body cladding to make it look even more hunkered down. And although the Grecale\u2019s shape recalls the Alfa Romeo Stelvio platform-mate, the Maserati\u2019s chiseled contours give it a different visual personality.\nThe Grecale\u2019s interior is suitably fabulous, and although there\u2019s still plenty of Stellantis influence in the electronics, most of the touchpoints are unique. My tester\u2019s black leather with red stitching gave the cabin a rich, couture aroma decidedly unlike the rubbery Ghibli, and the 3D Carbon trim is a delight for the eyes and fingertips. What\u2019s more, the leather and carbon fiber both come free of charge, so the automaker doesn\u2019t even charge you for the tactile, aromatic pleasure. Ask your Porsche dealer for the same courtesy in a Macan and you\u2019ll get laughed all the way to the Exclusive department.\nThe only really bad news inside the cabin is the frustrating infotainment package. The main 12.3-inch touchscreen and identically sized gauge cluster use a reskinned version of the Uconnect 4 and the touch response isn\u2019t phenomenal, requiring hard presses on the center display to make things happen. Worse still, the 8.8-inch \u201ccomfort display\u201d mounted low on the center stack tries to do too much, with everything from climate and seat massage adjustments to headlamp and ambient lighting controls. The menu structure is byzantine at best, leaving newbies bewildered for the first few weeks of ownership.\nRebrand the ergonomic frustration \u201cMediterranean charm\u201d and the Grecale Trofeo makes a tiny bit more sense \u2013 after all, I doubt the Maserati brothers cared about such things as button placement or headlight operation or airbags or seat belts. So let\u2019s just stop quibbling about touchscreens and go for a drive.\nHeart Racing\nThat V6 thrums to life via a button mounted on the steering wheel, greeting me on cold starts with a vibrant little rev before settling into a sedate idle. The sound is better suited to a Monaco boulevardier than a Grand Prix legend, but the Grecale makes sportier noises than I was expecting given my previous experience with a Trofeo. In its default GT drive mode \u2013 to which it annoyingly reverts at every key cycle \u2013 the Masi is easy to drive smoothly, with genteel throttle tip-in that gives way to good around-town thrust as you dig in deeper.\nMaserati claims the Grecale Trofeo will hit 60 miles per hour in just 3.6 seconds before charging to a top speed of 177 miles per hour. More impressive than the numbers is the sheer amount of thrust on tap from just about any gear and any engine speed. Part of the recipe for brilliant response is the \u201cNettuno\u201d V6 engine\u2019s pre-combustion chamber with its own spark plug. Fuel fills the pre-chamber during the compression stroke where it is ignited, and that ignition spreads to the main combustion chamber very efficiently, giving the car more power and faster turbo response than it might otherwise have.\nThe four-corner air suspension with adaptive dampers also provides good body control and ride comfort in that default mode, with little of the squishy, land-yacht feeling that can sometimes be a feature of balloon springs. That said, if you want a little more grand and a little less touring, you can spin the drive mode dial over to Comfort and get all the floaty, slushy responses of the DeVille you owned in 1982.\nAt the other end of the Grecale\u2019s register is the Sport driving mode, which uncorks the V6 engine for a far more exciting vocal performance and the throttle response of a chopsaw. Shifts from the eight-speed automatic transmission are firmer and more aggressive, with downshifts and overruns accompanied by a scintillating crackle from the exhaust. The gearbox has an obedient manual mode with chunky, aluminum paddle shifters; it\u2019ll even bounce off the rev limiter rather than automatically upshifting. But even with the TCU doing the decision-making, the Grecale holds gears through corners and readily downshifts on hard braking.\nThe suspension firms up as well, eliminating body motions and yielding a slightly firmer ride while still maintaining good wheel control over rough asphalt. On the winding, plunging road through Little Tujunga Canyon, the Grecale defaulted toward mild, safe understeer, but it also communicated those intentions very early, allowing me to ease up on the throttle and tighten the cornering line. The Bridgestone Potenza Sport tires \u2013 standard on every Trofeo \u2013 have resolute levels of grip, and they give up traction progressively so that a skilled driver can alter behavior before that happens.\nLike the rolling stock and suspension, the steering is surprisingly communicative. Little Tujunga Canyon Road isn\u2019t a paragon of smoothness, and as a result, I felt some kickback through the steering wheel over midcorner bumps. While that might not be appropriate for a more luxury-oriented crossover, it only adds to the Grecale\u2019s charm, affording me the information I needed to extract the most performance out of the little yellow SUV. From the snappy throttle, and crackling exhaust to the chatty suspenders and helm, Maserati has almost completely made up for whatever soul may have been missing from previous Trofeos.\nThere's Always A Catch\nI only say \u201calmost\u201d because there is a heady price to pay for the Grecale\u2019s performance. Starting at $106,995 including destination, ballooning to $136,795 for the example I drove. The lion\u2019s share of that comes from the unique \u201cFuoriserie\u201d Corse Yellow paint, which costs a staggering $19,000 all on its own \u2013 an 18-percent upcharge. Ditch the special out-of-series color and the price drops to a much more palatable $117,795. But even at its base price, the Trofeo is about $18,000 dearer than a 434-hp Macan GTS and $26,000 more than a 472-hp BMW X4 M. Neither are as quick, but for 20 grand, who\u2019s counting?\nWhere the Grecale Trofeo comes good is in offering a driving experience befitting its unique, Romagnolo heritage. Starting life in Bologna before moving to nearby Modena, Maserati comes from a part of Italy where everyone \u2013 from schoolboys to wizened old ladies \u2013 appreciates good exhaust notes as much as good tortellini in brodo. And while its Trofeo forebears seemed content to water that hereditary passion down a bit, the Grecale\u2019s heritage comes through as strong as ever. Maserati is back, and it\u2019s looking for a torrid and tragic love affair to celebrate the homecoming.\nCompetitors\n2023 Maserati Grecale Trofeo\nRECOMMENDED FOR YOU\nYou Can Get a Stupid Cheap Maserati From Hertz\nThese Were America's Highest-Paid Automotive CEOs in 2024\nMaserati Grecale gets Alba special edition with focus on technology\nShould You Bother Fixing a 2010 Nissan Altima's Starter Given the Cost?\nI Road-Tripped a Maserati Grecale Trofeo and All I Got Were Solar Eclipse Photos\nVolkswagen's Cheapest Electric SUV Is Coming\n50 Most Expensive SUVs In The World"

      "text": "5 Of The Coolest Features On Rivian Vehicles\nAlthough Rivian isn't as big as Tesla, it's one of its biggest competitors in the all-EV space, especially as it beat the latter by two years in bringing an EV pickup to market with the Rivian R1T. Today, its lineup consists of two models: the Rivian R1T pickup and the Rivian R1S, its full-size SUV version. Aside from these expensive, top-of-the-line models, Rivian also plans to launch two more affordable models: the mid-size R2, arriving in the first half of 2026, and the compact R3 and R3X SUVs.\nDespite the Rivian R1T besting other tried-and-tested brands in the 2023 Rebelle Rally, the lack of a nationwide charging infrastructure, range anxiety, and extreme weather are still some of the problems holding back electric trucks from the overlanding and off-road lifestyle. In fact, these are the same issues the Donut Media team encountered when they drove 100 miles off the beaten track in a Cybertruck.\nNevertheless, Rivian focuses its trucks and SUVs on the off-road lifestyle. To do this (and to justify its high price point), Rivian models have many features that you wouldn't find from other car makers. So, these are some of the coolest features we've seen so far on Rivian cars.\nThe Rivian R1T's Gear Tunnel\nWhen Rivian announced the R1T, the Gear Tunnel was one of the truck's key features. This 65-inch long storage space between the cab and the rear wheels allows you to transport and store long, outsized equipment like surfboards and golf bags. It's also useful for other accessories to improve your off-road and camping trips.\nOne notable accessory that Rivian had planned to sell for owners to install in the Gear Tunnel was the Camp Kitchen: a complete modular kitchen set that featured two cooktops, a sink, a water tank, and food preparation areas. Unfortunately, Rivian canceled this accessory to focus on delivering vehicles. They did recently announce that it's bringing back the Camp Kitchen as the Travel Kitchen, and it will attach to the back of the vehicle instead of the Gear Tunnel.\nNevertheless, the R1T still has a huge space that can accommodate different gear. And, if you're okay with non-Rivian branded accessories, Thunderbolt Adventure Supply offers a Rivian R1T-compatible Camp Kitchen with Gear Sled. So, if you can't wait for the new Rivian Travel Kitchen, you can get this one instead and start cooking from the side of your R1T today.\nPull-out Rivian Torch in the driver-side door\nOne of the simple luxuries Rolls-Royce is known for is the bespoke umbrella stored in the driver's door, which you'll find in the 2021 Rolls-Royce Ghost. While this is a sensible feature for Rolls-Royce owners (and its drivers who will use that to keep them dry), Rivian, being an outdoor lifestyle car maker, instead put a Rivian Torch in the driver's door.\nThis handy 1,000-lumen flashlight is available on the R1T and R1S, giving you light for up to 18 hours on a single charge. It will also automatically recharge when you replace it in its cradle in the driver-side door, so you'll always have a full charge every time you use it. You can also buy a Rivian Torch as a separate unit at the Rivian Gear Shop, where you can get it with a charger if you want to keep it at your house or shed.\nDespite being a simple feature, many drivers would appreciate the Rivian Torch, especially if you are camping overnight and need a flashlight to set up your gear in the dark. That way, you don't have to rely on your car's headlights, especially if parked away from your location.\nBuilt-in air compressor for tire inflation and more\nIn 2023, Agero reported that over 30% of new cars on the market no longer have spare tires. While getting a flat tire is not likely an issue you worry about daily, it's good to have a solution to tire problems so you don't have to wait for rescue if you experience one.\nUnfortunately, the Rivian R1T and R1S do not come standard with spare tires. You can purchase a full-size (for the R1T) or compact (for the R1s) spare tire that fits in a compartment in the vehicle. But even if you didn't purchase that option, Rivian does not leave you stranded because both models have a built-in air compressor.\nIf you encounter a tire issue, you can use this air compressor and a tire repair kit to get you back on the road. But more than that, the air compressor also has other uses. Is your gear dirty before packing it up? Use the air compressor to dust it off. Are your jackets wet after hiking in the rain, and you don't want to make a mess in the car? Blow off the water with the air compressor. Do you want to inflate an air bed (or pool) but forget to bring its motor? Air compressor.\nStandard panoramic glass roof on all models\nGlass roofs are often the hallmark of premium vehicles and are usually only found on top trims of some car models. However, on the R1T and the R1S, all trim levels have a panoramic glass roof. So, whether you pick the base dual-motor R1T or a fully-featured quad-motor R1S, you won't feel you're getting the shorter end of the trim-level stick.\nThis panoramic glass roof makes the vehicle feel airy and spacious, especially as you drive across trails and dirt paths. And with the second- and third-row seats on the R1S folding almost entirely flat, you can set up a mattress in the back of the car, allowing you to enjoy looking up at the night sky while in the car's safety.\nUnfortunately, if you're not a fan of panoramic glass roofs, Rivian doesn't offer any other roof option for now. Unlike most other SUVs with this feature, it also does not include a retractable sunshade, nor does it have photochromic glass \u2014 even as an option.\nThe Rivian R2's rear Bike Mount + Accessory ports\nWhile the R1T and R1S offer several unique features, it doesn't mean that Rivian is stopping there. In fact, we're already eyeing the upcoming R2, and we see several new features we like that aren't found in Rivian's current lineup.\nThe feature we're most excited about is the Bike Mount + Accessory ports at the back of the R2. The accessory ports are two slots built into the rear bumper of the R2 that support a removable Bike Mount that can carry two bicycles.\nWhile the Bike Mount is likely an option, we hope the Accessory ports will be standard in the R2. That's because if you're creative and handy with tools, you can create your own accessories for the R2, and you don't need to install a mounting rack to the SUV as it already has one. Third-party manufacturers could also make other accessories that could easily slip into the Accessory ports, further increasing the utility of the Rivian R2."

      "text": "2024 Maserati Grecale Trofeo Review: Can A Fast SUV Unseat Porsche's Macan?\nYou're spoiled for choice with luxury SUVs, and while specifications are important, sometimes illustrating said-specs by pointing at the class leader and saying \"we're better than them\" is the best way to make your mark. The 2024 Maserati Grecale, then, is a direct shot at some of the Italian automaker's \"German Rivals\" and, most specifically, the Porsche Macan. Like the Grecale, the Mecan is a high-end, high-performance SUV; it also happens to be Porsche's second-best selling car in the United States.\nOn paper, the Grecale outperforms the Macan in several key areas. However, paper doesn't always transfer to asphalt, so Maserati is taking no chances with its extra-potent Trofeo trim. Unlike the cheaper mild hybrid variants of the Grecale, and the upcoming 2025 Grecale Folgore EV, the Trofeo packs a Maserati-designed V6 \"Nettuno\" engine.\nIt's the same as you'll find in the GranTurismo coupe we drove last year, and what the automaker chose to replace the Ferrari V8s that were powering its performance models for many years. The twin-turbo V6 in the SUV isn't quite as powerful as the one you'll find in its sportier sibling, but it still churns out 530 horsepower \u2014 almost 100 hp more than the Macan \u2014 and around 457 lb-ft of torque. That all goes through an eight-speed transmission, with power being delivered to all four wheels.\nThe styling is on form\nIn a sea of aesthetic clones with marginally different specs, the Grecale stands out with far more distinctive styling. Indeed, it lives up to the \"Italian performance car\" billing with a sleek nose and a stance that looks a lot lower than it actually is. If cars have faces, then the Grecale has the air of an aging actress who's on her third facelift. Its eyes and mouth are a little stretched out, but this in itself is oddly fitting and surprisingly endearing. This isn't something I ever thought I'd type, but powering your way down a winding country road in a two-metric-ton Joan Collins really perks up a dull afternoon.\nThe styling also serves to make the vehicle seem a bit smaller than the exterior dimensions, and it handles like a smaller vehicle, too. Certainly sportier than the Macan, in my experience, though the upcoming electric Macan may change all that. Maserati's paint options also stand out: there are some bolder choices and special options available with certain trims, the company's selection of matte tones is pretty pleasing to the eye. The texture seems on point; there's a slight sparkle in the right light, but it also adds an air of formality to counteract a lot of the flare.\nIt functions very well as an SUV\nThe reason for the rising appeal of the SUV and crossover is easy to figure out: they're usually more practical. Maybe you have a need for storage space; perhaps you have mild off-roading ambitions; or it might simply be down to the continuous presence of passengers. Luckily, the Grecale Trofeo ticks all of the necessary boxes.\nAt 20 cu-ft it has class-leading levels of cargo capacity, if only just. The trunk is generously sized with the back seats up, while putting them down essentially gives you a small and luxurious van. You can comfortably fit three adults on the rear bench seat, and they'll all have an excessive amount of leg room \u2014 even if the people up front have their seats quite far back.\nAll-wheel drive and a generous amount of torque should see you through the snow and mud, if whatever you're driving on has a paved surface during the year's kinder seasons. It didn't struggle with upstate New York's crater-sized potholes, which is an achievement in itself.\nIt's great on the road\nWhen it comes to on-road performance, the Grecale Trofeo in no way disappoints. Its ride is incredibly comfortable, thanks in part to the air suspension system. Even in comfort mode, it has enough oomph to peel off a slip road with confidence or overtake a semi-truck in seconds.\nThe electrically-assisted steering is sharp and precise, helping keep the contribution of Maserati's wide array of driver's aids at bay. Those aids include lane assist (including a lane positioning view on the driver's screen), various parking sensors and cameras, and that little warning light on the wing mirror that has removed all need to ever check your blind spot.\nIn terms of grip, I didn't get the chance to take it out in the snow, slush, and general misery many people encounter for roughly half the year. At worst, things got a bit wet. The damp surface didn't affect things at all, just as you'd hope.\nCorsa Mode livens things up\nCorsa Mode is exclusive to the Trofeo trim, and not even the upcoming Folgore has access to it. Maserati's equivalent of \"sport\" mode drops the entire car by a couple of inches, making the whole thing more aerodynamic. More power will be sent towards the back wheels, and traction control will be toned down. The suspension firms up, the fuel economy goes down, and the throttle response gets more aggressive.\nWith all that, it's easy to forget you're in an SUV. You can comfortably launch from 0-60 in under 4 seconds, no matter your driving ability; cornering feels more involved, even though you're still pinned to the roads at speeds that won't land you a reckless driving charge. Pulling away from a stop light or navigating a bend in a country lane will become an exciting event instead of a factor in your everyday commute. While I'm a firm believer that most SUVs should be nowhere near a track, the Grecale should not be lumped in with its heavy, unbalanced brethren. It feels like a sports car, and you could totally treat it as such.\nOff-roading is an option, sort of\nOn paper, the Maserati Grecale has what it takes to perform off-road. Up to nine inches of ground clearance is practical; there's all-wheel drive; and it comes with a limited-slip self-locking electronic rear differential. Going off the spec\u2013the multi-link suspension, active shock absorbers, and air springs above each wheel\u2013mild to moderate off-roading shouldn't really be too much of a problem. Did I test this out? No. No, I did not.\nWhat really put me off more than anything was the lack of any shielding. The undertray appears to be made of plastic, and any encounter with something like a rock or root would destroy it completely and likely put a dent into the sump above it. Then, there are the overall aesthetics of the car. A true off-roader can take a punch, while the Maserati seems a bit too pretty. It'd be like snatching a top model from the cover of a high-end fashion magazine and handing them a pair of boxing gloves. The ability might be there for all we know, but is it worth risking its looks?\nFuel economy is moderate (and excusable)\nWhile there are far thirstier cars on the road, calling the Grecale Trofeo an economical vehicle would be pushing it. I averaged between 18 and 20 mpg during my testing, while comfort mode and careful driving nudged that up to 25 mpg. In one of the performance modes, and driving it like something worthy of a Maserati badge, fuel economy plummetted towards the low teens.\nThe Grecale's more affordable trims are both hybrids, with more economical I-4 engines in them as opposed to a variant of the engine Maserati jams in its supercar, and supercars aren't known for saving you cash at the pump. Still, while there are some supremely economical SUVs on the road these days, averaging around 20 mpg may not be the end of the world. The EPA puts the Macan alongside the Grecale Trofeo, at 19 mpg combined, for example.\nIt's something special inside\nMaserati can't half do interiors. All too often, you'll take a seat in a \"luxury\" car and find yourself surrounded in cheap plastic hell. Corners will be cut, comfort will be sacrificed, and you'll find yourself wondering where all the money has gone. There's no danger of that in the Grecale.\nExpect plush quilted leather, a smooth, flowing center console, and plenty of comfort features. The color choices have a huge impact on the car as a whole. A dark brown will make the whole thing seem more formal, red and black make you think sporting, and cream is a nice middle-ground choice. Again, this is where it will differ from the Macan. I'm hard-pressed to say one is \"better\" than the other, both are exceptionally well done. It's just one that makes you feel like you're commuting in the lounge of an Italian private member's club, while the other has the feel of an architect's living room. There's a definite \"old-world\" class to the Maserati.\nIt's not all smooth sailing\nMaserati's polish does stumble in places. Removing a gear selector entirely helps make the center console look cleaner, with a series of buttons running across the middle of the center console instead. I'm not one to argue aesthetics with the Italians, but from a practical standpoint, it's a bit of a pain. The buttons require a very deliberate press, or nothing at all will happen.\nThis issue carries over to the touchscreen: on a few occasions, a light tap just wasn't doing it, and I either had to repeat an action or perform it more deliberately. Then there's the fact everything is a bit convoluted. Turning on and adjusting the climate control took more thought than it should, especially for something you'll do more often. It's one of those systems that makes you think going buttonless is a bad idea.\nWhere there are buttons, they can be questionably located. Again, this is a design choice, but Maserati places an emphasis on controlling the binnacle display and using driver aids with its steering wheel controls. The multimedia controls are hidden on the back of the wheel, hard to spot, and take a lot of getting used to.\nFor the most part, these are within the realm of personal preference. You may prefer these things, or at least get used to them if a Grecale is your daily driver for a couple of years. Except for the touchscreen issues: hopefully that's more of a software glitch, and can be improved with a future update.\n2024 Maserati Grecale Trofeo Verdict\nThere does come a time in people's lives when an SUV seems inevitable, and practicality threatens to outweigh any hopes, ambitions, or soul you have left. If there's still that spark of humanity inside you that wants to rip the rear end on a backroad from time to time, maybe even visit a track on occasion, or just crack a smile when you toast a Mercedes at the lights, then the 2024 Grecale Trofeo should be on your shortlist.\nIt has the space and practicality you want from an SUV, is capable enough to push through the winter months, and is sufficiently comfortable inside to let you know you've bought luxury. When push comes to shove, though, what stands out is that it drives like a sports car. It's an SUV for people who don't really like SUVs, but can't get by without one.\nDoes it beat the Germans (or, for that matter, the other high-profile SUVs of 2024)? Well, that depends on your personal preferences. Performance-wise, it edges out the Macan (at least, for now). It's also a touch bigger, though not new Cayenne-scale, nor to a degree where it'll make a huge difference. The biggest difference is in style. If you want flair, if you prefer Andrea Pirlo to Bastian Schweinsteiger, Pavarotti to Kurt Moll, or Fiano to Riesling, then the Maserati is the obvious choice."

      "text": "2024 Porsche Cayenne S E-Hybrid Squeezes Speed And Comfort From Plug-In Hybrid SUV\nPorsche has revealed all the luxurious details on the updated 2024 model year Cayenne S E-Hybrid and the subsequent Coupe version. The battery size has been boosted to 25.9 kWh. But more importantly, the SUV's overall performance is seeing some impressive gains. With both the turbocharged three-liter V6 and its electric motor going at full tilt, the Cayenne E-Hybrid now generates 512 horsepower and 553 pound-feet of torque. That power doesn't mean a lot if the Porsche can't lay down some rubber. Fortunately, it delivers.\nAccording to a press release from Porsche, the 2024 Cayenne E-Hybrid can rocket itself to 60 miles per hour in 4.4 seconds. Quarter-mile times are not usually a metric touted by German luxury automakers, but Porsche wanted to note that not only does the new Cayenne S E-Hybrid run a quarter-mile in 13 seconds flat, it's actually a tenth of a second faster than a twin-turbo V8 powered Cayenne. Not bad at all.\nSix-figure super SUV\nOn the comfort and convenience end, the E-Hybrid comes standard with adaptive air suspension that can allow for a broad range of suspension settings, from gliding on a pillow to stiff as a board for more performance-oriented driving. Porsche has not revealed the battery's range, but it notes that it can be fully charged in two and a half hours when using a Level 2 charger.\nYour typical luxury staples like 20-inch wheels are standard as well as a dual tailpipe exhaust system so everyone else will know that you have a big SUV that can smoke some muscle cars in a drag race. Porsche says the new Cayenne will reach dealers by spring of next year and it starts at a very Porsche-like $99,100 with the coupe cresting six figures at $104,000. Prices do not include the obligatory $1,650 delivery charge. You can place an order for a 2024 Porsche Cayenne S E-Hybrid SUV or Coupe starting September 25."
