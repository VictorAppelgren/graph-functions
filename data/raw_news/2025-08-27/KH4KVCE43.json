  "title": "Samsung External SSD 1TB Hits a New Low Price on Amazon, and Samsung Has No Idea",
  "description": "This external SSD is a no-brainer: fast, secure, and compact.",
  "content": "Samsung hasn\u2019t even realized the amazing Back to School deals happening on Amazon, but the savings are real and massive. One perfect example is the Samsung T7 portable SSD which is a hugely popular 1TB external solid-state drive that\u2019s now at a record low price of $79, down from $109. It is a smart move to have your data secure even when your laptop is compromised or infected by viruses.\n\nThis SSD has a spacious 1TB capacity which means that you can store thousands of pictures, videos, files, and many more without worrying about running out of storage space. It\u2019s USB 3.2 Gen 2 connected, with blisteringly quick transfer rates of up to 1,050 MB/s read and 1,000 MB/s write. Copying large files or moving game libraries would take seconds and you would save precious time.\n\nThe Samsung T7 has a thin and durable metal casing which measures 85 by 57 by 8 millimeters, and weighs just 58 grams which is less than the average smartphone. The drive is also shockproof and can tolerate falls of up to 2 meters without compromising its performance or data integrity.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it features AES 256-bit hardware encryption and password protection support through Samsung\u2019s Portable SSD software. This protects your sensitive information from unauthorized access without compromising on the performance of the device. It\u2019s a reassuring feature that adds an extra layer of safety without interfering with your regular use.\n\nAside from speed and security, the Samsung T7 features an intelligent thermal guard system that prevents overheating during massive file transfers, ensuring your SSD maintains a smooth performance while having a long lifespan. The dynamic temperature control prevents throttling and performance remains consistent even on intensive use such as gaming or video editing in high definition.\n\nIt is simple to attach the T7 thanks to its USB Type-C port which features backward compatibility with USB 3.0 and even USB 2.0 (though speeds will be reduced on older ports). Both a USB-C to C cable and a USB-C to A cable are supplied with the package so you can use it out of the box with most modern devices. Plug-and-play installation is a breeze, so you can start stowing or saving your files right away.\n\nDon\u2019t miss out before stock sells out.",
