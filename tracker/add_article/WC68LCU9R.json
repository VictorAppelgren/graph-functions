      "summary": "Wall Street surged on Friday as investors reacted to Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s hint that rate cuts could come, lifting the S&P 500 1.6%, the Dow 2.1% and the Nasdaq 2%. Treasury yields fell as expectations of a September cut rose, and smaller‑cap stocks, homebuilders and travel firms led the gains. Nvidia and other AI‑chip makers also saw gains amid optimism over AI demand, while the rally was tempered by concerns over Trump’s tariffs and weaker job data. The rally marked the best day in months for the market, pushing major indices toward new all‑time highs.",
