      "text": "The US LBM Coaches Poll is conducted weekly throughout the regular season using a panel of head coaches at Football Bowl Subdivision schools. The panel is chosen by random draw, conference by conference plus independents, from a pool of coaches who have indicated to the American Football Coaches Association their willingness to participate. Each coach submits a Top 25 with a first-place vote worth 25 points, second place 24, and so on down to one point for 25th.\nLearn more about our partnership with US LBM.| Rank | Team | Record | PTS | 1st | Prev | Chg | Hi/Lo |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | TexasTex | 0-0 | 1606 | 28 | NR | - | 1/1 |\n| 2 | Ohio StateOhioSt | 0-0 | 1565 | 20 | NR | - | 2/2 |\n| 3 | Penn StatePSU | 0-0 | 1525 | 14 | NR | - | 3/3 |\n| 4 | GeorgiaUGa | 0-0 | 1466 | 3 | NR | - | 4/4 |\n| 5 | Notre DameND | 0-0 | 1360 | 0 | NR | - | 5/5 |\n| 6 | ClemsonClem | 0-0 | 1324 | 2 | NR | - | 6/6 |\n| 7 | OregonORE | 0-0 | 1307 | 0 | NR | - | 7/7 |\n| 8 | AlabamaBAMA | 0-0 | 1210 | 0 | NR | - | 8/8 |\n| 9 | LSULSU | 0-0 | 1056 | 0 | NR | - | 9/9 |\n| 10 | Miami (FL)MIA-FL | 0-0 | 823 | 0 | NR | - | 10/10 |\n| 11 | Arizona StateASU | 0-0 | 806 | 0 | NR | - | 11/11 |\n| 12 | IllinoisIll | 0-0 | 734 | 0 | NR | - | 12/12 |\n| 13 | South CarolinaSCAR | 0-0 | 665 | 0 | NR | - | 13/13 |\n| 14 | MichiganMich | 0-0 | 580 | 0 | NR | - | 14/14 |\n| 15 | Ole MissMiss | 0-0 | 573 | 0 | NR | - | 15/15 |\n| 16 | SMUSMU | 0-0 | 555 | 0 | NR | - | 16/16 |\n| 17 | FloridaFla | 0-0 | 498 | 0 | NR | - | 17/17 |\n| 18 | TennesseeTenn | 0-0 | 492 | 0 | NR | - | 18/18 |\n| 19 | IndianaIU | 0-0 | 460 | 0 | NR | - | 19/19 |\n| 20 | Kansas StateKSU | 0-0 | 438 | 0 | NR | - | 20/20 |\n| 21 | Texas A&MTexA&M | 0-0 | 392 | 0 | NR | - | 21/21 |\n| 21 | Iowa StateIaSt | 0-0 | 392 | 0 | NR | - | 21/21 |\n| 23 | BYUBYU | 0-0 | 287 | 0 | NR | - | 23/23 |\n| 24 | Texas TechTTU | 0-0 | 261 | 0 | NR | - | 24/24 |\n| 25 | Boise StateBoise | 0-0 | 246 | 0 | NR | - | 25/25 |\nOklahoma 221; Missouri 142; Louisville 126; USC 116; Utah 86; Baylor 76; Auburn 50; Iowa 49; Memphis 34; Army West Point 33; Tulane 31; Georgia Tech 27; TCU 24; Nebraska 19; Syracuse 16; Washington 15; Navy 14; Arkansas 14; Duke 12; Colorado 12; Minnesota 11; UNLV 8; Florida State 8; Kansas 6; Vanderbilt 3; Buffalo 1;\nThe US LBM Board of Coaches for the 2025 season: Tim Albin, Charlotte; Dave Aranda, Baylor; Tim Beck, Coastal Carolina; David Braun, Northwestern; Jeff Brohm, Louisville; Fran Brown, Syracuse; Troy Calhoun, Air Force; Jason Candle, Toledo; Ryan Carty, Delaware; Jamey Chadwell, Liberty; Bob Chesney, James Madison; Curt Cignetti, Indiana; Chris Creighton, Eastern Michigan; Spencer Danielson, Boise State; Ryan Day, Ohio State; Kalen DeBoer, Alabama; Manny Diaz, Duke; Dave Doeren, North Carolina State; Eliah Drinkwitz, Missouri; Sonny Dykes, TCU; Jason Eck, New Mexico; Mike Elko, Texas A&M; Luke Fickell, Wisconsin; Jedd Fisch, Washington; James Franklin, Penn State; Marcus Freeman, Notre Dame; Hugh Freeze, Auburn; Willie Fritz, Houston; Alex Golesh, South Florida; Thomas Hammock, Northern Illinois; Blake Harrell, East Carolina; Tyson Helton, Western Kentucky; Charles Huff, Southern Mississippi; Brent Key, Georgia Tech; GJ Kinne, Texas State; Zach Kittley, Florida Atlantic; Tre Lamb, Tulsa; Dan Lanning, Oregon; Rhett Lashlee, SMU; Clark Lea, Vanderbilt; Lance Leipold, Kansas; Pete Lembo, Buffalo; Sean Lewis, San Diego State; Mike Locksley, Maryland; Chuck Martin, Miami (Ohio); Joey McGuire, Texas Tech; Bronco Mendenhall, Utah State; Jeff Monken, Army; Jim Mora, Connecticut; Eric Morris, North Texas; Billy Napier, Florida; Pat Narduzzi, Pittsburgh; Brian Newberry, Navy; Ken Niumatalolo, San Jose State; Jay Norvell, Colorado State; Gerad Parker, Troy; Brent Pry, Virginia Tech; Matt Rhule, Nebraska; Rich Rodriguez, West Virginia; Jay Sawvel, Wyoming, Willie Simmons, Florida International; Kirby Smart, Georgia; Mark Stoops, Kentucky; Jon Sumrall, Tulane; Lance Taylor, Western Michigan; Jeff Traylor, Texas-San Antonio; Scotty Walden, Texas-El Paso.\n*The highest and lowest ranking each team has held during the designated season.
