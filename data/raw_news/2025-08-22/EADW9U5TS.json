  "description": "Wall Street is counting down to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's highly anticipated speech at Jackson Hole.",
  "content": "US stock futures pushed higher on Friday as Wall Street counted down to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's highly anticipated speech at Jackson Hole.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) rose 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) moved up 0.2%. and contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose 0.1% \u2014 all on the heels of another downbeat day for stocks.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) is currently seeing a five-day losing streak as tech stocks got beaten up by AI trade doubts. The US benchmark indexes are on track for a weekly loss.\n\nAll eyes are on Jackson Hole for whether Powell signals an interest-rate cut is coming next month, amid division among Fed rate-setters about the path of policy. His remarks are likely to shake up rate-cut bets, already on the wane after a weak monthly jobs report. Traders are losing faith in an easing in September, pricing in about 70% odds of a cut on Friday, compared with 85% a week ago.\n\nThe Fed chair is also expected to lay out changes to the central bank's framework review when he speaks at 10 a.m. ET \u2014 potentially shaping monetary policy for years to come.\n\nThe White House will be watching as closely as Wall Street as President Trump continues to push the Fed and Powell to lower rates. Trump this week opened a new front in his public pressure campaign, with a call for the resignation of Fed governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud.\n\nOn the earnings front, Zoom (ZM) popped in premarket after reporting an AI boost, and Ross Stores (ROST) jumped as shoppers seek discounts amid tariffs.

      "text": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n-\nThe Chart of the Day\n-\nWhat we're watching\n-\nWhat we're reading\n-\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nWith valuations so high, it didn't take much for Wall Street to hit pause on the AI trade. What started earlier this week as negative rumblings has grown into something louder and more concerning.\nAfter news got out that Meta had begun a restructuring of its new AI team, the Wall Street Journal reported the company froze hiring in its AI division, fresh off recruiting more than 50 AI researchers and engineers with the lure of massive job offers.\nInvestors might have welcomed such a halt in big spending had it been another company. After all, the compensation packages, valued at hundreds of millions of dollars across several years, looked like professional athlete money.\nBut Meta has trumpeted its AI expenditures as proof of its commitment and a reflection of its grand ambitions. In turn, the market applauded. Only Nvidia (NVDA), the chip company supplying the tech platforms, has performed better this year. Meta shares are up more than 25%, outmaneuvering Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), tickers with a more natural AI fit and a technological head start.\nNow, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly turned off the spigot. No more 10-year, $252 million A-Rod-style contracts. Worse than the end of the big money contracts, though, is the reason Meta had to offer them in the first place.\nA reminder that's good news for the AI industry, but bad news for Meta.\nRather than reading Zuck's AI reshuffling and hiring pullback as a bearish signal for the AI trade, it's worth considering a simpler interpretation: This is another sign of Meta's AI dysfunction.\nAs John Herrman, New York Magazine tech columnist, told Yahoo Finance in a live interview and wrote in a column of his own this week, Meta having to spend all that money to attract AI talent stems from a company culture increasingly perceived as hostile to its workers, lacking a clear vision, and with bumbling strategies. Idealistic researchers and motivated technologists see themselves and their style of work in other outfits, he said, whether that's Sam Altman's leading-edge work at OpenAI or even the cavalier ethos and ideology and the associated chaos that surrounds Elon Musk's xAI.\nMeta's absurd offers were a way to overcome its disadvantages, perhaps, a sign of desperation rather than a show of strength.\n\"There is a war over talent, but it's not a billion-dollar-a-head war,\" Herrman said in the interview. \"That's Meta's problem. That's because they can't recruit the same way that OpenAI can.\""

Consider that in 2024, market bulls were boasting about 24%-plus S&P 500 returns. No one was very focused on the broad market index's 1.2% dividend yield. But dividends are an important element of return, and 2025 is bearing that out. Through May, the S&P 500 was up a thin 1.1%; without dividends, there was essentially no returns at all. Indeed, dividend income accounted for 42% of the total return of the S&P 500 between 1930 and 2012, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some of those decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for a smaller portion of returns, at around 15%-20%. Not for nothing, in 2022, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices turned bearish as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates. We saw that pattern in 2018 as well. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main investment categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks.\nThe Argus Sustainable Growth Theme Model Portfolio\nSustainable Impact Investing is gaining traction not only with Argus Research clients but also with the global investment community. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, first focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. Given the strategy's focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead.\nSolid tax season and fiscal 3Q25 results\nIntuit Inc. provides financial management and compliance products for small businesses, self-employed individuals, consumers, and accounting professionals in the U.S. and worldwide.

      "text": "'TOO ANGRY, TOO STUPID': Trump bashes Fed Chair Powell after central bank leaves interest rates unchanged\nPresident Trump escalated his criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell a day after the central bank kept rates on hold, saying in a social media post that Powell is \"TOO ANGRY, TOO STUPID, & TOO POLITICAL\" to have his job.\n\"He is costing our Country TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS, in addition to one of the most incompetent, or corrupt, renovations of a building(s) in the history of construction! Put another way, 'Too Late' is a TOTAL LOSER, and our Country is paying the price!\"\nThe new attack on Thursday morning followed the fifth consecutive meeting where the Fed decided to leave rates unchanged, defying Trump's repeated calls for a cut.\nTwo Fed governors dissented and argued for a quarter percentage point reduction, the first time two Fed governors have done so at a policy meeting since 1993.\nRead more: How the Fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments\nPowell at a press conference Wednesday did not budge from his view that more time is needed to assess the impact of Trump's tariffs on inflation and the economy, saying that there is still a \"a long way to go\" to figure that out and \"you have to think of this as still quite early days.\"\nHe also declined to say whether a cut was on the table for the Fed's next meeting in September and made it clear that inflation was still a concern as the Fed balances its dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment.\n\"In the end, there should be no doubt that we will do what we need to do to keep inflation under control.\"\nA new reading on inflation released Thursday showed price increases accelerated in June more than expected as inflation remained above the Fed's 2% target.\nThe \"core\" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, rose 2.8% on an annual basis, above the 2.7% economists had expected and higher than the 2.7% seen in May.\nThe new PCE reading \"will do little to ease the Fed\u2019s concerns about tariff-driven inflation,\" Capital Economics assistant economist Harry Chambers said in a Thursday note.\n\"If these pressures persist, as we expect, a September cut looks unlikely.\"\nTraders have narrowed the odds of a cut in September, lowering them to roughly 40%. Trump on Wednesday said he does expect a cut at the next meeting, telling reporters before the Wednesday rate hold was announced that \"I hear they're going to do it in September.\""

      "text": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Bond investors are heading into Friday\u2019s much-anticipated Jerome Powell speech largely expecting the Federal Reserve chair will indicate policymakers will start cutting interest rates next month.\nPowell\u2019s speech, slated for 10 a.m. New York time at the central bank\u2019s annual gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, has been the focal point this week, for good reason. In recent years, he has used the occasion to make market-moving policy news, with investors zeroing in on whether the Fed chair pushes back \u2014 or not \u2014 on the current pricing for rate cuts.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n-\nWhy New York City Has a Fleet of New EVs From a Dead Carmaker\n-\nNeom\u2019s Desert Ski Resort Strains Saudi Prince\u2019s $1.5 Trillion Plan\n-\nTrump Takes Second Swing at Cutting Housing Assistance for Immigrants\n-\nChicago Schools Seeks $1 Billion of Short-Term Debt as Cash Gone\nInterest-rate swaps have retreated in recent days amid hawkish comments from other Fed officials and mixed economic data. But the market still shows about a 65% chance of a quarter-point cut at the September meeting, and close to 50 basis points of easing for 2025.\nPowell has come under intense pressure from President Donald Trump and other White House officials to resume cutting rates, with the central bank on hold at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December. Jackson Hole may well see Powell enshrine the Fed\u2019s policy independence.\nA hawkish tone during the speech will likely weigh on shorter-dated government bond yields. It may also add pressure to a recent series of large trades in the options market, which have targeted an outsized rate cut next month and a total of 75 basis points of reductions by year-end.\nThere\u2019s a \u201cgood chance\u201d that Powell will strike a hawkish tone, implying that he is not inclined to lower rates, said Tom di Galoma, managing director at Mischler Financial Group.\nTo preserve policy flexibility, Powell may remind investors that any move in September depends on the next round of employment and inflation reports, scheduled for release early next month.\n\u201cPowell will not want to lock in a rate cut path for a decision in September, he will probably fall a little bit on the side of suggesting that the economic data has weakened enough to support consideration of a rate cut,\u201d said Jason Pride, head of investment strategy and research at Glenmede.\nThat approach will probably keep the bond market in its current range, with the two-year camped at around 3.75% and the 10-year stuck near 4.30%.\nShorter-dated yields have already moved 11 to 16 basis points lower across two- and five-year notes this month, holding on to some of the rally that was triggered by weak July employment data."

      "text": "President Trump on Wednesday called on Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to resign as the public pressure on the central bank continues to build.\n\"Cook must resign, now!!!\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, on Wednesday morning. He included a link to a Bloomberg report about a letter sent by Federal Housing Finance Agency head Bill Pulte urging Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate Cook over a pair of mortgages.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Cook stated, \"I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet. I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\u201d\nPulte wrote in a letter dated Aug. 15 that Cook \"falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud under the criminal statute.\"\nLate Wednesday morning, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump has told aides he is \"considering attempting to fire\" Cook.\nThe president's call for Cook to resign comes as public pressure on the Fed continues amid ongoing changes on the Fed's Board of Governors.\nLast week, Trump nominated Council of Economic Advisers Chair Stephen Miran to the Fed board to fill a seat left empty by Adriana Kugler, who stepped down from the board on Aug. 8. Should Cook also step down, Trump would have the opportunity to nominate another Fed governor.\nThe search for a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term leading the central bank ends in May 2026, also continues in the background. Trump said last week that the field of possible replacements for Powell was \"down to three or four\" candidates.\"\nTrump has repeatedly called on Powell to cut rates more aggressively, coining the nickname \"Too Late\" for the Fed chair. Trump first appointed Powell to the role in 2017; former President Joe Biden renominated Powell as Fed chair in 2021.\nHe's also targeted the central bank's $2.5 billion renovation of the Federal Reserve's headquarters as a \"sort of\" fireable offense for the Fed chair. Trump and Powell met at the renovation site in late July as Trump once again called for Powell to lower interest rates.\nRead more: How much control does the president have over the Fed and interest rates?\nPowell is also a member of the Fed's Board of Governors, and his term expires in 2028. It isn't clear whether Powell will also vacate that post when his term as Fed chair ends next year."

      "text": "Nvidia's (NVDA) upcoming earnings day may boil down to one key question: Will China be part of its outlook?\n\"If NVDA were to include China in its guidance, we believe it would contribute an incremental $2-3 billion in revenue,\" KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh wrote in a new note.\nVinh expects strong Q2 results, driven by demand for Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs, when the chipmaker reports on Wednesday. But he warned that guidance for Q3 could be conservative, given uncertainty around US export licenses to China.\nStill, KeyBanc reiterated its Overweight rating and lifted its price target to $215 from $190, pointing to Nvidia's central role in the AI boom and supply-demand dynamics that remain firmly in its favor.\nNvidia's near-term growth story looks solid without China. Supply of Nvidia's Blackwell B200 GPU jumped 40% in Q2 and could rise another 20% in Q3, according to Vinh. Simultaneously, shipments of the more advanced Blackwell Ultra (B300) are ramping up, reinforcing Nvidia's dominance in AI chips.\nKeyBanc raised its full-year shipment forecast for Nvidia's rack-sale AI systems, known as GB200. The firm now expects 30,000 units to ship this year, up from 25,000 previously, citing stronger yields and improved supply-chain execution.\nFor now, KeyBanc assumes Nvidia will exclude China revenue from its guidance. That mirrors the approach of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which earlier this month left China out of its outlook amid the same regulatory uncertainty.\nThe Chinese impact on Nvidia is significant. KeyBanc raised its Q2 revenue estimate to $47.1 billion from $45.1 billion, above Wall Street\u2019s consensus of $45.7 billion. It raised earnings per share to $1.05 from $0.99, slightly above consensus of $1.00.\nBut with Nvidia agreeing to pay 15% of Chinese chip sales to the US government, plus China's push for domestic AI chips, the company is likely to adopt a more conservative stance on its financial forecast.\nFor Q3, KeyBanc cut its revenue estimates to $50.4 billion from $53.5 billion, versus a consensus of $52.6 billion. EPS was clipped to $1.14 from $1.22, below the Street's consensus of $1.19. Longer term, KeyBanc trimmed fiscal 2026 forecasts on China risks, but boosted 2027 expectations on stronger rack shipments due to accelerating spending by hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG).\nWall Street remains bullish. Morgan Stanley recently called Nvidia the most undervalued megacap stock in the market. Its shares are up more than 30% year to date and over 35% in the past 12 months."

Meanwhile, more policymakers indicated this week that they don't necessarily view a rate cut as imminent.\nAmid that rate debate, jobless claims for the week ending Aug. 15 rose to 235,000, versus expectations for 225,000.

But its quarterly profit fell short of high expectations, and its shares slid more than 4%.\nThe Fed kicks off its Jackson Hole symposium of central bankers from around the world later on Thursday, with the countdown on to Chair Jerome Powell's highly anticipated speech on Friday.

      "text": "BANGKOK (AP) \u2014 Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said Friday that the company is discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration.\nHuang was asked about a possible \u201cB30A\u201d semiconductor for artificial intelligence data centers for China while on a visit to Taiwan, where he was meeting Nvidia's key manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., the world's largest chip maker.\n\u201cI\u2019m offering a new product to China for ... AI data centers, the follow-on to H20,\u201d Huang said. But he added that \"That\u2019s not our decision to make. It\u2019s up to, of course, the United States government. And we\u2019re in dialogue with them, but it\u2019s too soon to know.\u201d\nSuch chips are graphics processing units, or GPUs, a type of device used to build and update a range of AI systems. But they are less powerful than Nvidia\u2019s top semiconductors today, which cannot be sold to China due to U.S. national security restrictions.\nThe B30A, based on California-based Nvidia's specialized Blackwell technology, is reported to operate at about half the speed of Nvidia's main B300 chips.\nHuang praised the the Trump administration for recently approving sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to China after such business was suspended in April, with the proviso that the company must pay a 15% tax to the U.S. government on those sales. Chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, was told to pay the same tax on its sales of its MI380 chips to China.\nAs part of broader trade talks, Beijing and Washington recently agreed to pull back some non-tariff restrictions. China approved more permits for rare earth magnets to be exported to the U.S., while Washington lifted curbs on chip design software and jet engines. After lobbying by Huang, it also allowed sales of the H20 chips to go through.\nHuang did not comment directly on the tax when asked but said Nvidia appreciated being able to sell H20s to China.\nHe said such sales pose no security risk for the United States. Nvidia is also speaking with Beijing to reassure Chinese authorities that those chips do not pose a \u201cbackdoor\u201d security risk, Huang said.\n\u201cWe have made very clear and put to rest that H20 has no security backdoors. There are no such things. There never has. And so hopefully the response that we\u2019ve given to the Chinese government will be sufficient,\u201d he said.\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's internet watchdog, recently posted a notice on its website referring to alleged \u201cserious security issues\u201d with Nvidia's computer chips."

We saw some minor sell signals on August 1, but they have been erased. The major indices rallied last week, albeit in choppy fashion, with up days on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and down days on Tuesday and Thursday. The sell signals and warnings that we had on August 1 included a bearish crossover of the five-day- and 13-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), a break of the 21-day EMA, and the cycling of the Vortex indicator into negative territory. In addition, price volatility picked up following the July 31 bearish reversal, and that can be a bad sign after a big advance. The 21-day rate of change (ROC) got very close to cycling into negative territory before popping last week. We still have two bearish divergences on the daily moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD) after cycling into extreme overbought territory -- a warning, but not a sell signal. For now, it looks like the major indices could be at the start of another leg higher, with the S&P 500 (SPX) just missing a closing all-time high on Friday and the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 reaching closing highs. The Commitment of Traders (COT) data for the SPX remains bullish, but is bearish for the Nasdaq 100. The data for the volatility index (VIX) is bullish, suggesting we could see another move higher and then an eventual pullback in the stock market. Over the weekend, Ethereum broke out of a base going back to March 2024 and is close to all-time highs, while Bitcoin broke out of a flag on Sunday and also is near to all-time highs.

Consider that in 2024, market bulls were boasting about 24%-plus S&P 500 returns. No one was very focused on the broad market index's 1.2% dividend yield. But dividends are an important element of return, and 2025 is bearing that out. Through May, the S&P 500 was up a thin 1.1%; without dividends, there was essentially no returns at all. Indeed, dividend income accounted for 42% of the total return of the S&P 500 between 1930 and 2012, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some of those decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for a smaller portion of returns, at around 15%-20%. Not for nothing, in 2022, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices turned bearish as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates. We saw that pattern in 2018 as well. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main investment categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks.\nThe Argus Sustainable Growth Theme Model Portfolio\nSustainable Impact Investing is gaining traction not only with Argus Research clients but also with the global investment community. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, first focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. Given the strategy's focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead.\nSolid tax season and fiscal 3Q25 results\nIntuit Inc. provides financial management and compliance products for small businesses, self-employed individuals, consumers, and accounting professionals in the U.S. and worldwide.

It offers a wider range of items and smaller pack sizes than Costco and Sam's. The company posted total revenue of $20 billion in FY25, which ended on February 1, 2025. As of 1Q26, income from membership fees represented 2.3% of total revenue and 59% of operating income. The company sells name-brand merchandise and food to members, who are small business owners and consumers. Based in Westborough, Massachusetts, the company also offers specialty services, including tire installation, optical services, and photo developing. At the end of fiscal 1Q26, the company operated 255 BJ's clubs and 190 gas stations in 21 states. More than half of the clubs are in four states: New York, Florida, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. About 23% of FY25 sales were generated in the New York City metro area (down from 25% in FY21 and FY20). Clubs range from 43,000 to 177,000 square feet. BJ's sells a relatively narrow assortment of approximately 7,000 SKUs, which it has discussed trimming to about 6,000 to improve inventory turnover. Groceries represented 71% of the company's FY25 net sales (70% in FY24, 67% in FY23, 71% in FY22); general merchandise and services accounted for 11% in FY25, 11% in FY24, and 12% in FY23 and 14% in FY22. Gasoline rose to 21% in FY23 from 15% in FY22 and 9% in FY21. Gas was 19% of sales in FY24 and 18% in FY25. A predecessor company, BJ's Wholesale Club, traded as a public company until it was acquired on September 30, 2011, by an investor group led by Leonard Green & Partners and CVC Capital. On July 2, 2018, the company again went public as BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings on the NYSE. CVC and Leonard Green held no shares when the company published its FY21 annual report. The company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. The convention at Argus, Bloomberg, and other data service providers is to number the fiscal year based on the calendar year in which it ends. BJ's current fiscal will end on January 31, 2026. We thus call the current year FY26 while the company calls it FY25. The just completed year had 52 weeks. The year ended February 3, 2024, had 53 weeks.\nRatingPrice TargetStock indices are well into the red at midday on Friday as the renewal of\nStock indices are well into the red at midday on Friday as the renewal of tensions in the Middle East has now been added to the list of items roiling the global economic and geopolitical spaces.

The company limits the use of distribution centers where possible and stores inventory on pallets directly on the sales floor, often in bulk quantities. The company also offers a limited assortment of 7,000 stock-keeping units at its warehouses to achieve greater procurement scale on select items.

      "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. has instructed component suppliers including Samsung Electronics Co. and Amkor Technology Inc. to stop production related to the H20 AI chip, the Information reported, citing unidentified sources.\nNvidia issued those orders this week after Beijing urged local companies to avoid using the H20, the Information said, referring to a chip designed specifically for the Chinese market. The US company\u2019s shares slid about 1.3% in US pre-market trading.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n-\nWhy New York City Has a Fleet of New EVs From a Dead Carmaker\n-\nNeom\u2019s Desert Ski Resort Strains Saudi Prince\u2019s $1.5 Trillion Plan\n-\nTrump Takes Second Swing at Cutting Housing Assistance for Immigrants\n-\nChicago Schools Seeks $1 Billion of Short-Term Debt as Cash Gone\nA production suspension would raise questions about fundamental demand for the H20, a less-powerful version of Nvidia\u2019s cutting-edge AI accelerators that competes with similarly capable chips from the likes of Huawei Technologies Co. and Cambricon Technologies Corp. The latter company\u2019s shares soared as much as 20% Friday, leading a rally in fellow Chinese chip stocks.\nNvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. both recently secured Washington\u2019s approval to resume lower-end AI chip sales to China, on the controversial and legally questionable condition that they give the US government a 15% cut of the related revenue. But their Chinese customers are under pressure to adopt homegrown chips instead \u2014 part of a broader objective to build a world-class domestic industry and wean the country off US technology.\nIn past weeks, Chinese authorities have sent notices to a range of firms discouraging use of the less-advanced semiconductors, Bloomberg News has reported. That followed warnings about alleged security risks in the H20, after Washington officials said they were considering ways to equip chips with better location-tracking capabilities.\nThe scrutiny coincides with the growing capabilities of homegrown alternatives to Nvidia designed by Huawei and its peers. On Thursday, Chinese AI phenomenon DeepSeek said its latest AI model was customized to work with next-generation Chinese-made AI chips, without elaborating.\nChief Executive Officer Jensen Huang on Friday said he was surprised when Beijing expressed those concerns and was now addressing that in talks with the authorities. But he reiterated that the H20 houses no such security backdoors. Huang, who was in Taiwan to discuss his upcoming Rubin chip with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., said Nvidia\u2019s also in talks with Washington about a potential follow-up to the H20 for China, though that depended on the Trump administration."

The stakes are high, with traders speculating that weakening jobs growth could open the door to a more dovish stance. But the risk is Powell stays tight-lipped after a string of hot inflation prints.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n-\nWhy New York City Has a Fleet of New EVs From a Dead Carmaker\n-\nNeom\u2019s Desert Ski Resort Strains Saudi Prince\u2019s $1.5 Trillion Plan\n-\nTrump Takes Second Swing at Cutting Housing Assistance for Immigrants\n-\nChicago Schools Seeks $1 Billion of Short-Term Debt as Cash Gone\n\u201cPowell is in a really tough spot,\u201d said Jon Hilsenrath, senior advisor at StoneX Group Inc. \u201cHe\u2019ll likely acknowledge a September rate cut looks likely, but won\u2019t give any room for a timetable on a succession of cuts because the Fed\u2019s job tackling inflation isn\u2019t done yet.\u201d\nThis is the challenge for money managers who\u2019ve plunged back into the market since the S&P 500 Index bottomed during the tariff panic in early April. Options traders expect the equities benchmark to swing 0.9% in either direction on Friday, according to data compiled by Piper Sandler & Co.\nThe Fed chief will probably signal his inclination for a quarter percentage point rate cut in September, but will limit how far he can go in light of the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and inflation, according to Hilsenrath, who became known the \u201cFed Whisperer\u201d during the 2008 global financial crisis when he was covering the central bank for the Wall Street Journal.\nThe Fed still has three policy-setting meetings left in 2025, and traders are betting that it will respond to signs of labor weakness by lowering borrowing costs. The problem is the job market is just one side of the central bank\u2019s mandate. Inflation is the other, and it remains stubbornly above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Whether it can cool rising prices without slowing growth remains an open question.\nInterest-rate swaps now show at least half a percentage point of rate reductions by the end of the year, with the odds of a September cut at 72%, down from roughly 100% just last week when inflation data showed a widening gap between consumer and producer prices.\nThe Fed\u2019s Jackson Hole symposium usually isn\u2019t a big catalyst for the stock market unless there are big shifts in monetary policy. Since 2000, the S&P 500 has climbed 0.4% on average in the week following the gathering, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show."

That was fewer than the 114,000 expected and below the 60,000 added in April. The result was the smallest increase in private payrolls since March 2023, with the financial press generally blaming uncertainty over trade wars and tariffs. ADP's chief economist noted the following. 'After a strong start to the year, hiring is losing momentum. Pay growth, however, was little changed in May, holding at robust levels for both job-stayers and job-changers.' The weak reading sets up for an even more closely-watched nonfarm payrolls report by the government on Friday.\nArgus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 06/02/2025: Companies Raising Guidance\nThis first-quarter earnings season has had a special tone. As usual, many companies have offered guidance. But they also have increasingly focused on the economy, tariffs, and overall uncertainty. On tariffs specifically, managements are detailing any likely impact on profits and any plans to pass price hikes on to customers and/or consumers. Our team of analysts is factoring all this fresh data into sector outlooks, earnings forecasts, and investment ratings. We track the list of companies raising guidance, and this quarter that list often features companies in sectors such as Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Healthcare, Industrial, and Information Technology. Often missing are companies the Financials, Energy, and Materials sectors. Companies that are still able to raise guidance despite the tariff and macroeconomic uncertainty could feature managements that have flexibility in a changing environment, and that is often a catalyst for market-beating returns. Indeed, \"Management Signals\" is one of our Investment Themes for 2025. The following is a list of some of the companies in our Fundamental Universe of Coverage where management recently increased guidance."

OpenAI\u2019s board formally rejected Musk\u2019s bid in February.\nMusk and his representatives didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Meta declined to comment. OpenAI declined to comment beyond the court filing.\nMusk worked with Sam Altman to found OpenAI a decade ago before going on to launch a rival startup, xAI. He has been locked in a legal skirmish with OpenAI, repeatedly trying to derail the startup\u2019s plans to restructure as a more conventional for-profit business. The billionaire filed two lawsuits against OpenAI for allegedly straying from its founding principles and asked a court to block the company\u2019s restructuring efforts.\nEvidence that Musk was quietly trying to persuade one of OpenAI\u2019s chief rivals to help him acquire the startup could undercut the billionaire\u2019s legal claims that Altman\u2019s partnership with Microsoft Corp. betrayed the OpenAI\u2019s charity mission. The judge overseeing the legal battle previously has written that \u201cefforts by Musk to incorporate OpenAI into Tesla or to convert it into a for-profit company are relevant because they may be inconsistent\u201d with his claims against Altman and OpenAI.\nOpenAI asked in the filing Thursday for the judge to order Meta to turn over documentation related to any communication the tech company had with Musk.\nMeta urged the court to deny OpenAI\u2019s request, saying, \u201cMeta\u2019s documents can hold no evidence of \u2018coordination\u2019 with Musk, or of Meta\u2019s purported attempt to purchase OpenAI, or of any other relevant information when Meta did not join Musk\u2019s bid.\u201d\n\u201cMeta\u2019s communications (if any) with entities that did join the bid also hold little to no relevance, and in any event, should be sought from those entities, not Meta, which did not participate,\u201d the company added."

      "text": "JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. \u2014 When Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gives his last speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., investors will be listening for whether he signals an interest rate cut is coming next month.\nBut Powell's outline of two bigger questions facing the Fed will shape the future of the central bank in ways that will outlast his tenure and mark a key part of his legacy as chair.\nPowell's widely anticipated speech on Friday morning will be delivered as the debate over the state of the economy and the possibility of rate cuts heats up.\nIn interviews with Yahoo Finance on Thursday, Kansas City Fed president Jeffrey Schmid and Cleveland Fed president Beth Hammack both offered some caution on the need for interest rate cuts as soon as next month, given recent inflation data.\n\"There's a lot of data we're going to get between now and September, and I walk into every meeting with an open mind about what the right thing to do is,\" Hammack said. \"But with the data I have right now, and with the information I have, if the meeting was tomorrow, I would not see a case for reducing interest rates.\"\nSchmid and Hammack's colleagues at the Federal Reserve Board, Michelle Bowman and Chris Waller, have been among those more vocal about the need for rate cuts. Investors were assigning roughly 69% odds on a 0.25% cut from the Fed on Sept. 17 as of early Friday.\nDisagreement over the Fed's next move, however, is only a small part of the backdrop against which Powell is set to speak.\nMost notable is pressure from President Trump, who this week called for Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to resign amid a controversy over two mortgage loans. The Financial Times reported Thursday that the Department of Justice sent Powell a letter calling on the Fed chair to remove Cook from her post.\nTrump, who refers to Powell as \"Too Late\" for not cutting rates earlier this year, has regularly commented on Fed policy and said interest rates should be much lower than the current benchmark range of 4.25%-4.50%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also weighed in on monetary policy, saying in an interview earlier this month that the Fed ought to consider cutting rates by 0.50% in September.\n\"I think that having an independent central bank has been an institutional arrangement that has served the public well,\" Powell said last month. \"And as long as it serves the public well, it should continue and be respected.\"\nPowell is also expected to lay out changes to the central bank\u2019s policy framework review, which articulates the Fed\u2019s strategy and commitment to fulfilling its congressional mandate for stable prices and maximum employment.\nIn particular, the central bank is expected to drop so-called average inflation targeting, a policy put in place pre-pandemic when inflation was running low and Fed officials wanted to avoid deflation.\nThis strategy has said that if inflation ran below 2% in years past, the Fed would tolerate it running above 2% in the future on the theory that it averages out. Given the recent bout of inflation and the risks it poses to the economy, the Fed is expected to drop that and focus on an inflation target of simply 2%.\nPowell signaled the change in a speech in May.\n\u201cIn our discussions so far, participants have indicated that they thought it would be appropriate to reconsider the language around shortfalls,\u201d Powell said. \u201cAnd at our meeting last week, we had a similar take on average inflation targeting.\u201d\nThe Fed first created its monetary policy framework in 2012, which it adjusts every five years. And just as the changes announced back in 2020 had implications for monetary policy actions over the past five years \u2014 the Fed's language shift, it could be argued, kept the lid on rate hikes even as inflation accelerated in 2021 \u2014 so too could the changes Powell announces Friday send ripples for years to come.\n\u201cWhile the adoption of the new framework in 2020 was not the primary factor behind the Fed\u2019s delay and the substantial inflation overshoot, it contributed to this outcome,\u201d said Matt Luzzetti, chief US economist for Deutsche Bank\nAs a result, Luzzetti expects Powell\u2019s speech to restore a more preemptive strategy for monetary policy, along with recognizing risks of supply shocks and a return to a balanced view of inflation and the job market.\nJames Fishback, CEO of hedge fund Azoria, argued Powell needs to acknowledge what he calls the \u201ctragic mistake\u201d of average inflation targeting.\nPowell noted in his May speech that inflation could be more volatile going forward than in the 2010s and that the US may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks.\n\"The economic environment has changed significantly since 2020, and our review will reflect our assessment of those changes,\u201d Powell said in a speech in May.\nPowell also stressed enhancing the Fed\u2019s formal policy communications, particularly regarding the role of forecasts and uncertainty. Investors will watch for whether the Fed rolls out changes to its quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, which contains the famous \"dot plot,\" a compilation of each member of the FOMC\u2019s expectations for interest rates that year.\nJennifer Schonberger is a veteran financial journalist covering markets, the economy, and investing.

      "text": "(Reuters) -Ross Stores (ROST) on Thursday topped quarterly profit estimates and reinstated its annual earnings forecast, betting on demand for discounted apparel and accessories as tariffs raise retail prices during the holiday season.\nThe company's shares were up about 2% in premarket trading on Friday after it also forecast strong holiday quarter profit.\nDiscount stores are expected to attract budget-conscious customers as President Donald Trump's tariffs force companies to raise prices on products sourced from countries hit with steep duties.\nRoss Stores' comparable sales rose 2% in the second quarter, with improvement through the period, and strong demand in July, as shoppers looked for discounted back-to-school apparel and accessories.\nExcluding items, the company reported a profit of $1.56 per share for the three months ended August 2, topping estimates by 2 cents, according to data compiled by LSEG.\nIt reinstated its outlook and expects annual earnings per share of $6.08 to $6.21, compared to estimates of $6.10. This includes a per-share tariff impact of 22 cents to 25 cents.\nRoss Stores withdrew its annual forecasts in May amid tariff uncertainty, and added that more than half of its goods it sells originate from China.\nThe company said it was adjusting prices strategically, and diversifying sourcing to cushion the tariff impact.\nRoss Stores expects third-quarter profit of $1.31 to $1.37 per share, below estimates of $1.47, but it targets a profit of $1.74 to $1.81 per share for the key holiday quarter, which was above estimates of $1.69.\n\"We are looking at the back half of the year with cautious optimism ... there's a lot going on in the macro environment,\" Conroy said.\nRival and TJ Maxx parent TJX (TJX) raised its annual profit target earlier this week, helped by strong demand for discounted apparel and home furnishings.\nRoss Stores targets comparable store sales growth of 2% to 3% for the third and fourth quarters. Analysts had expected growth of 2.59% and 2.14%, respectively.\nSecond-quarter sales of $5.53 billion fell short of estimates of $5.57 billion.\n(Reporting by Juveria Tabassum in Bengaluru; Editing by Vijay Kishore)"

      "text": "By Nicholas P. Brown\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Nike's (NKE) push into the booming outdoor recreation market \u2014 which will kick off on Monday with the launch of a new trail running shoe \u2014 will test whether it can turn a little-known sub-brand into a meaningful growth engine.\nThe sportswear giant plans to unveil a version of its Ultrafly trail running shoe - branded under its outdoor sub-brand, ACG - at the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc, an ultramarathon in France that begins on Monday, Nike spokesman Jay Paavonpera said.\nIt is part of Nike's push to reposition ACG as a serious player in performance trail running. More broadly, the move is in line with CEO Elliott Hill's strategy to refocus the Nike brand around core sports like running at a time when its dominance is being challenged by smaller rivals.\nNike is playing catch-up in both outdoor recreation, which has surged since the pandemic, and in China, where the populace has taken to outdoor activities like trail running in a big way. The company's lagging performance in both markets goes some way toward explaining why its share of the global sportswear market has ebbed in recent years, analysts said. Outdoor recreation includes a range of activities including hiking and camping.\nNike-sponsored runners like Anthony Costales will race in the shoe, dubbed the ACG Ultrafly, which is set to hit shelves in spring 2026, Nike said. A similarly rebooted, ACG-branded version of the Zegama trail runner will launch later in 2025.\nBrands like Salomon and Hoka \"have broken out and done well\" in trail running, said Morningstar analyst David Swartz, and \"Nike needs to fight back.\"\nDoing it with ACG - short for All Conditions Gear - will not be easy. The unit, which debuted in 1989 with a focus on hiking and biking, is now associated with \u201cgorpcore,\u201d a fashion trend that incorporates functional gear into stylish wardrobes. It is usually relegated to a shelf or two at Nike stores, often next to \u201ca picture of a guy walking up a mountain, or something like that,\" said Swartz.\nBut with China and ACG, Nike may be playing a long game as it plans to expand its businesses across that market. It established its ACG team as a sub-brand in October and put Angela Dong, vice president for all of Greater China, in charge of the unit. In June, Hill said its biggest opportunity in China is \"from a brand perspective, to inspire and invite the 1.3 billion consumers into the world of sport, lifestyle sport and to fitness.\u201d\nSales of outdoor apparel nearly doubled in China between 2019 and 2025, with outdoor footwear ticking up 65% over the same period, according to Euromonitor International data. Nike, though, has logged double-digit sales declines in China in each of the last three quarters."

      "text": "Tech stocks fell for a second day on Wednesday as investors sold off a slew of tech names amid concerns over the sustainability of the AI boom and a recent market rotation away from some of this year's biggest winners.\nAmong the \"Magnificent Seven\" Big Tech stocks, Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) fell nearly 2%, while Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) stock fell around 1%. Nvidia (NVDA) pared losses to end the day down fractionally after dropping 3.5% Tuesday.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) also recovered from an earlier decline Wednesday, ending the trading session down less than 1%, while fellow chip stock Broadcom (AVGO) dipped more than 1%. Micron (MU) shares plunged roughly 4%.\nCoreWeave (CRWV), the AI data center company that rents computing power to Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta \u2014 making it essentially an AI pure play \u2014 dropped over 1%, putting the stock down more than 20% over the past five trading sessions.\nPalantir (PLTR), a defense tech stock that\u2019s seen a major upswing from the AI boom, sank 1%, extending its recent losing streak.\nThe rotation out of AI-linked stocks comes as sentiment soured this week on the market for artificial intelligence, fueled in part by a recent report from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and commentary from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\nResearchers for MIT\u2019s Project NANDA authored a report released this week that said 95% of companies it studied are getting no return on AI. The findings of the report were first detailed by Fortune on Monday.\nThat report followed commentary from OpenAI\u2019s Altman shortly after the ChatGPT-maker finished out its latest multibillion-dollar funding round, with the CEO telling reporters that he believes there\u2019s an AI bubble, a diversion from his prior characterizations.\n\u201cWhen bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,\u201d he said. \u201cAre we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes.\"\nDA Davidson analyst Gil Luria likened the changing market sentiment to a pendulum.\n\u201cThis is really just the pendulum swinging back,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.\nAI stocks have taken off in recent months after a rocky start to the year. A new, cost-effective AI model from Chinese firm DeepSeek released in January cast doubt on the massive sums of money Big Tech was spending to build out AI infrastructure to power the technology \u2014 and sent tech stocks tumbling.\nTwo rounds of earnings updates from some of the biggest AI plays in the market and more clarity on Trump's trade policies have since quelled those fears."
