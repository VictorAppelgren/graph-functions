  "content": "Apple has released two software updates to iOS 18.6. Since the iPhone software update has shipped without issue, and one contained a major security patch, Apple has stopped signing the older iOS 18.6 software version.\n\nApple stops signing versions of iOS due to security issues being disclosed in older software versions and patched in newer software versions.\n\nApple released iOS 18.6 on July 29. The update included bug fixes, security improvements, and a fix for a performance issue with the Photos app\u2019s Memories feature. The update also included a change to how third-party app marketplaces are handled in the EU.\n\nApple separately detailed the full list of security improvements that were made in iOS 18.6.\n\nMore recently, Apple released iOS 18.6.1, re-enabling blood oxygen readings from Apple Watch in the US, and iOS 18.6.2, a major security update.\n\nNext month, Apple is expected to release iOS 26 after beta testing versions with developers and public beta testers since June.",

Here\u2019s what to expect from the latest release.\niOS 18.6.2 now available with security updates\nApple has just released new software for iPhone users, available from Settings \u21fe General \u21fe Software Update.\nThe previous update, iOS 18.6.1, brought Blood Oxygen support back to compatible Apple Watch models.\niOS 18.6.2, however, isn\u2019t expected to include any new features for users.\nRather, this update focuses on \u201cimportant security fixes.\u201d\nHere are Apple\u2019s release notes:\nThis update provides important security fixes and is recommended for all users.\nFor information on the security content of Apple software updates, please visit this website:\nhttps://support.apple.com/100100\nIt\u2019s possible iOS 18.6.2 could be the last iPhone software update before iOS 26 launches next month.\nSo far there\u2019s no evidence of iOS 18.7 being in the works, but that could always change soon.\nIn the absence of an 18.7 update, the next major iPhone release will be iOS 26. It\u2019s packed with new features, headlined by the Liquid Glass redesign that will also bring a fresh look to macOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and more.\nAlthough Apple is using its iOS 26 beta cycle to eliminate as many bugs from that new release as possible, it\u2019s likely iOS 18.6.2 will remain the most stable iPhone software for a while.\nSo whether your iPhone supports iOS 26 or not, iOS 18.6.2 should prove a solid option for anyone opting not to install Apple\u2019s flashy update right at launch.\nAre you planning to stay on iOS 18 for a while, or will you install iOS 26 right away? Let us know in the comments.\nBest iPhone accessories\n- AirPods Pro 2 (now only $169, down from $249)\n- MagSafe Car Mount for iPhone\n- HomeKit smart plug 4-pack\n- 10-year AirTag battery case 2-pack\n- 100W USB-C fast charging power adapter\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

According to Apple\u2019s website:\n- iOS 18.6 and iPadOS 18.6 provide an updated user experience in the EU for installing an alternative app marketplace from a developer\u2019s website.\n- iOS 18.6 and iPadOS 18.6 provide an updated user experience in the EU for installing an app from a developer\u2019s website.\nApple will likely publish more details about the security updates included in iOS 18.6 on its website later today.

      "text": "As expected, Apple is rolling out iOS 18.6.1 to iPhone users today. This update, along with watchOS 11.6.1, introduces a \u201credesigned Blood Oxygen feature\u201d for Apple Watch Series 10, Series 9, and Ultra 2 in the United States.\nWhat\u2019s new in iOS 18.6.1?\nAs we reported this morning, Apple is rolling out a new version of the Blood Oxygen feature for Apple Watch users in the United States. This comes over 18 months after Apple began selling the Apple Watch without the Blood Oxygen feature in America due to a patent dispute with health technology company Masimo.\nThe redesigned version of the Blood Oxygen feature is available for Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 users in the U.S. who do not have the original Blood Oxygen feature.\nHere\u2019s how the redesigned version of the feature works after updating to iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1.\nYou can initiate a session in the Blood Oxygen app on your Apple Watch, and the sensors on your Apple Watch will then collect the required data. Your iPhone utilizes this data to compute your blood oxygen measurements. The results are saved in the Respiratory section of the Health app on your iPhone. However, you won\u2019t be able to view the results directly on the Apple Watch itself.\nHere are Apple\u2019s release notes for iOS 18.6.1:\nThis update provides a new Blood Oxygen experience for users in the United States with Apple Watch Series 9 and Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2. Measurements are calculated on iPhone and viewed in the Health app.\nApple also says that there is \u201cno impact to Apple Watch units previously purchased that include the original Blood Oxygen feature, nor to Apple Watch units purchased outside of the U.S.\u201d\nYou can update your iPhone to iOS 18.6.1 by going to the Settings app, choosing General, then choosing Software Update. There are no other changes in the update.\nAfter you update to iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1, your Apple Watch will also download an over-the-air asset for the new Blood Oxygen feature. This could take up to 24 hours. To help initiate the download, you can open the ECG app on Apple Watch or the Health app on iPhone.\nMy favorite iPhone accessories\n- Add wireless CarPlay to any car\n- Anker MagSafe 3-in-1 Charging Cube\n- Smart Robot Vacuum with HomeKit\n- Satechi Foldable Charging Stand\n- Anker MagGo Power Bank\nFollow Chance: Threads, Bluesky, Instagram, and Mastodon.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
