      "feedback": "The analysis rightly centers Apple’s WWDC 2025/iOS 26 Liquid Glass as the immediate driver and nods to cross‑ecosystem dynamics, but to reach world‑class quality it should tighten the 0–3 week framing into a crisp, testable set of near‑term catalysts, thresholds, and reactions (e.g., iOS 26 public beta uptake in mid‑July; beta/GA timelines from sources 9 and 6; real‑world incremental lift from iPadOS/MacOS Sequoia alignment). It should replace broad “eco‑system” intuition with a first‑principles causal chain: Liquid Glass strengthens platform cohesion and upgrade propensity across iPhone/Pad/Mac/WatchOS/TVOS/VisionOS, which in turn boosts early iPhone 16/Pro‑era demand signals and spending on Apple peripherals (7YX5NQ7C1, 9, 10); meanwhile, AirPods Max gains in 24‑bit/48 kHz lossless wired latency expand pro/workflow appeal for Apple‑centric users (7YX5NQ7C1) but keep price and H2‑chip limitations as headwinds (7YX5NQ7C1). To lift a 0–3 week view, introduce a three‑way scenario (base, bull, bear) with explicit reaction functions and market thresholds: e.g., if iOS 26 beta uptake exceeds a defined share by mid‑July, expect elevated ecosystem chatter and modest hardware upgrade tempo; if PubMatic faces a October 20, 2025 lead‑plaintiff deadline with no settlement momentum, expect ad‑tech risk repricing; if Freevee is migrated to Prime Video by August 2025, anticipate a near‑term shift in Prime engagement but mixed ad‑revenue implications. Quantify anchors wherever possible: AirPods Max price at $549; battery life around 20 hours (base) or up to 30 hours with case/ANC variants; Apple lossless 24‑bit/48 kHz wired latency gains; PubMatic class‑action timelines and certifications; and the iOS 26 model list (which devices will receive updates). Reconcile conflicts cleanly (AirPods Max vs XM6/Ultra in ANC and price; Freevee vs Prime Video monetization) and attach citations after each factual claim (IDs: 7YX5NQ7C1, W7K0HLJA8, 4LDHF4T77, 7GZKAASFW, M6M4LNMC4, 9, 6). Finally, add a tight “what to monitor next” checklist with explicit data points (beta adoption rate, key iOS 26 features in GA, PubMatic docket progress, Freevee/Prime migration cadence) to convert the piece from descriptive to actionably predictive.",
