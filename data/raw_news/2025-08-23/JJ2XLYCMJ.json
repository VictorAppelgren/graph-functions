  "content": "\"bluffed\" its way into flipping the script on Republicans and Donald , according to a new report. Politico on Saturday published a story called, How California bluffed its way into a redistricting war with Trump, in which the outlet quotes \"nearly 50 people involved with the effort\" who \"shared details with POLITICO about the tightly guarded process.\" California is currently in the process of potentially altering its district maps in response to Texas' redistricting. But it started off as a \"bluff,\" according to reporters. \"When word got out that Texas might undertake an extraordinary mid-decade redistricting at Donald Trump\u2019s behest, a handful of top California Democratic operatives floated an idea to Rep. Zoe Lofgren: Could California respond in kind?\" according to the weekend report. \"Lofgren, the chair of California\u2019s 43-member Democratic delegation, consulted in June with a trusted data expert who dismissed it as absurd \u2014 a foolhardy end-run around the state\u2019s popular redistricting panel with no guarantee of yielding enough blue seats to fully offset Texas. Deterred by those misgivings, California Democrats instead spent weeks putting up a front, without making any real plans to do so.\" The piece quotes Lofgren as saying, \u201cIt seemed to me worth a bluff... If the Texans and Trump thought they\u2019d go through all of this and they\u2019d end up not gaining anything, maybe they would stop.\u201d She then added, \u201cBut they didn\u2019t stop... They just doubled down.\u201d However, the bluff soon met reality. \"So did California Democrats, especially Gov. . In a matter of weeks, they bluffed themselves into the marquee political contest of Trump\u2019s second term, a high-voltage fight and the remaining years of his presidency,\" according to the outlet. Summing up, the reporters wrote, \"In the end, 87 of 90 Democrats voted to put the maps on the ballot \u2014 a display of consensus that [Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas] said was made possible by the California-under-siege mentality that had been building up ever since Trump re-took the .\" \u201cIt\u2019s Whac-a-mole. We\u2019ve been trying to play defense,\u201d Rivas reportedly added. \u201cBut we finally just threw up our hands and said, \u2018We\u2019ve got to flip the script.\u2019\u201d",

      "text": "MAGA is panicking as Trump finally meets his match\nGavin Newsom knows that politics isn\u2019t just about policy papers or legislative roll calls \u2014 it\u2019s about culture, imagery, and the stories people tell each other. That\u2019s why he\u2019s been trolling Donald Trump online with parody memes and razor-sharp mockery that\u2019s spread faster than any campaign ad ever could.\nThe effect is unmistakable: the California governor is shifting the cultural battlefield, showing that Democrats can seize the same terrain of humor and symbolism Republicans have dominated since Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201claw and order\u201d days. Newsom has left conservative pundits \u2014 particularly on Fox \u201cNews\u201d \u2014 sputtering.\nIt\u2019s the kind of cultural jujitsu that Antonio Gramsci imagined \u2014 flipping power by seizing the symbols and frames of your opponent \u2014 and it\u2019s the kind of thing Democrats have needed to do for years but haven\u2019t successfully pulled off since the days of FDR\u2019s New Deal and LBJ\u2019s Great Society.\nGramsci sat in one of Mussolini\u2019s prison cells in the 1920s and 1930s, scribbling his Prison Notebooks and thinking about power. The Italian Marxist theorist recognized something most political leaders of his era missed: raw political control is never enough.\nTo truly rule with the broad consent of a nation\u2019s citizens, he realized, you have to shape the culture. You have to convince people that your worldview is \u201ccommon sense,\u201d that your version of reality is the only normal, natural way to see the world.\nHe called this \u201ccultural hegemony.\u201d The churches, the schools, the newspapers, the songs people sang, the plays they watched and the stories they told all carried values. And those values shaped politics far more than any speech in parliament.\nIf you win the cultural battle, he argued, you will inevitably win the political one.\nGramsci\u2019s ideas didn\u2019t stay locked up with him. They passed through post-war European intellectuals, the British cultural theorists of the 1950s and 60s, and the American left in the academy. But conservatives were reading too, and by the 1990s a handful of right-wing thinkers had begun warning that liberals were using \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d to dominate universities and Hollywood.\nTheir solution was simple: steal Gramsci\u2019s insight and use it to push back. Andrew Breitbart put the slogan on bumper stickers: \u201cPolitics is downstream from culture.\u201d Steve Bannon made it into a strategy for the Trump White House.\nChange the story the nation tells itself, control the cultural conversation, and politics will follow.\nRepublicans have taken that playbook and used it ruthlessly. Following Frank Luntz and other experts\u2019 advice, they reduce every issue to a frame that touches the gut, not the head, and then repeat it until it becomes the background noise of American life.\nNixon gave us one of the earliest, ugliest examples. His \u201claw and order\u201d campaign wasn\u2019t about crime in general; it was code for crushing the civil rights movement and suppressing Black political power.\nHis \u201cwar on drugs\u201d wasn\u2019t a moral crusade against addiction; as his aide John Ehrlichman later admitted, it was a way to criminalize Black people and anti-war activists. They couldn\u2019t outlaw being Black or protesting the Vietnam War, but they could associate both with drugs and then use police and prisons to break movements and communities.\nThat was cultural framing at its most cynical and vicious. Nixon didn\u2019t have to talk about race. He just had to say \u201claw and order\u201d and \u201cdrugs,\u201d and racist white voters understood the code.\nThe pattern has repeated itself ever since.\nWhen Republicans attack reproductive rights, they don\u2019t say they want to outlaw abortion or strip women of autonomy; they say they\u2019re defending \u201clife.\u201d That single word is a cultural sledgehammer. Democrats, for years, answered with \u201cchoice,\u201d which at least carried some emotional punch, but over time they got pulled into defending Planned Parenthood against smears and explaining the economic dimensions of reproductive healthcare as a women\u2019s \u201ceconomic issue.\u201d Important arguments, yes, but they don\u2019t resonate at the same visceral level as \u201clife.\u201d\nOn healthcare, Republicans took the word \u201cchoice\u201d and made it their own. \u201cChoose your own doctor\u201d became the mantra of those defending corporate-controlled healthcare and insurance. Democrats talked about \u201csingle payer\u201d or \u201cpublic options,\u201d language that could have come out of an actuary\u2019s report. \u201cChoice\u201d sounds American, even when it means choosing between bad insurance plans or facing bankruptcy.\nWhen Republicans use Reagan\u2019s favorite phrase \u201csmall government,\u201d people picture a plucky individual freed from bureaucrats and taxes, a man out west on horseback making a life for himself and his family out of the wilderness. What they mean, though, is making government too weak to tax billionaires, regulate corporate pollution, or protect people from discrimination.\nBut Democrats never met this frame with one of their own. Instead of talking about \u201cgovernment that works for all,\u201d as FDR and LBJ once did, Democrats let the conversation drift into debates over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges or the technical structure of regulatory agencies.\nFDR understood that people don\u2019t want less government or more government; they want a government that works for them. That is a cultural message, not a policy paper, and Democrats have abandoned it ever since Jimmy Carter\u2019s well-intentioned but wonk-driven presidency.\nRepublicans say \u201ctax relief,\u201d and suddenly taxes are a disease from which you need to be liberated. Democrats counter with discussions about marginal rates and progressive brackets instead of using FDR\u2019s old line that, \u201cTaxes are what we pay for civilized society. Too many individuals, however, want civilization at a discount.\u201d\nRepublicans say \u201cred tape,\u201d and instantly every rule protecting you from being poisoned, cheated, or injured is recast as a useless nuisance. Democrats instead talk about the importance of \u201cregulation,\u201d something all of us would like less of in our lives.\nRepublicans say \u201cfreedom,\u201d and people see flags and hear the national anthem. Instead Democrats, too often, talk about \u201cprograms\u201d or \u201csafety nets.\u201d\nThe same dynamic plays out on guns. Republicans wrap the issue in the word \u201cfreedom\u201d and the power to \u201cfight tyranny.\u201d Democrats come back with talk about universal background checks and assault weapons bans. Important, necessary measures, but they don\u2019t touch the same cultural nerve.\nDemocrats could have framed gun control differently: freedom from being shot at school, freedom from being afraid in a grocery store, freedom from the constant terror that your child might not come home. That\u2019s freedom that resonates with ordinary people. But by ceding the cultural word \u201cfreedom\u201d to the GOP, Democrats let Republicans define what freedom means in America.\nOn immigration, Republicans talk about \u201csecure borders\u201d and \u201csovereignty.\u201d Democrats talk about \u201cpathways to citizenship.\u201d Republicans make it about the survival of the nation, Democrats make it about paperwork. The Democratic Party is the party of the Statue of Liberty (that was installed during Democrat Grover Cleveland\u2019s presidency), yet Republicans have stolen the cultural image of America and turned it into one of a fortress under siege.\nEducation has become another cultural battlefield. Republicans push \u201cparents\u2019 rights\u201d and book bans \u201cto protect our children.\u201d Democrats respond with statistics about test scores and defenses of teachers\u2019 unions. But the cultural high ground belongs to the idea that every child has the right to learn the truth, and every parent has the right to send their kid to school without censorship or fear. Republicans frame themselves as liberators of children, even as they chain them to ignorance. Democrats need to call that out for what it is, in cultural terms that are impossible to ignore.\nThe lesson is the same in every case. Republicans don\u2019t win by having better policies: their policies are almost uniformly cruel, corrupt, and designed to serve the morbidly rich at the expense of everyone else. They win because they fight at the cultural level. They win because they tell a story, over and over, that makes people feel. Democrats, for decades, have responded with charts that only tickle the intellect.\nIt wasn\u2019t always this way. During the New Deal and the Great Society, Democrats owned the culture wars. FDR didn\u2019t talk about the Securities and Exchange Commission; he talked about \u201csaving capitalism from itself,\u201d about \u201crestoring faith in America,\u201d about \u201cfreedom from want and fear.\u201d\nLyndon Johnson didn\u2019t just present Medicare as a program; he said it was part of building a Great Society where people could live with dignity. He sold the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts with similar rhetoric. Those were cultural narratives, not policy briefs. They tied the Democratic party to the most powerful emotions and aspirations of the American people.\nIf Democrats want to win again, they have to stop ceding the cultural battlefield. Instead, they need to seize today\u2019s opportunities to fully engage in the culture wars, from policy prescriptions to Gavin Newsom ridiculing Trump to JB Pritzker calling out the GOP\u2019s embrace of fascism.\nThat means reframing every major issue not just in terms of policy mechanics, but in terms of the classic and compelling American values of freedom, fairness, safety, dignity, and opportunity.\n- Taxes aren\u2019t a burden; they are the way we all pay for the freedom and opportunity America makes possible.\n- Regulations aren\u2019t red tape; they are the rules that keep the game fair.\n- Healthcare isn\u2019t about exchanges; it\u2019s about whether you have the right to live without fear of medical bankruptcy.\n- Guns aren\u2019t about background checks; they\u2019re about whether your child comes home from school alive.\n- Immigration isn\u2019t about paperwork; it\u2019s about whether America still stands for the promise on the Statue of Liberty.\nRepublicans learned from Gramsci and weaponized culture. They turned it into dog whistles, slogans, and memes that bypass reason and lodge themselves in the national gut. Democrats can learn from the same source without resorting to the GOP\u2019s lying, cruelty, and thinly coded racism.\nThe closest Democrats have come in recent years was Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cHope and Change\u201d campaign in 2008, revisited in 2012. But those terms, while culturally potent, lost their impact as the Democratic Party continued to bow to the demands of the banks (not a single bankster went to prison for the 2008 crash they caused) and health insurance (Obamacare was written by the Heritage Foundation and gifted the industry with trillions after Obama dropped the public option) industries.\nWe can tell the story of freedom that is big enough to include everyone. We can tell the story of America not as a fortress for billionaires but as a community where everyone has a fair shot and nobody is left behind.\nLike FDR and LBJ, Democrats can again talk about America realizing its potential as a \u201cwe society\u201d instead of the selfish Ayn Rand \u201cme society\u201d that Republicans idolize with their \u201cI got mine, screw the middle class\u201d policies and memes.\nThe alternative is to keep losing ground to a Republican Party that has mastered the art of cultural hegemony in the worst sense of the term. Nixon showed how destructive that could be with his law and order rhetoric. Reagan perfected it with his \u201cwelfare queen\u201d lies. Trump and Bannon have pushed it into the realm of authoritarian spectacle, where politics becomes theater and culture becomes a weapon to bludgeon democracy itself.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\nThe Democrats of the New Deal and Great Society eras knew how to speak to the heart as well as the head. They knew that politics is not just about what laws are passed but about what stories a nation tells itself about who it is. They knew that culture is not an afterthought; it is the riverbed through which politics flows.\nRepublicans now know it too, and they\u2019ve been poisoning that river for half a century. If Democrats want to save democracy, they must reclaim the story of America, the cultural high ground, and the word freedom itself."

      "text": "This Trump kryptonite just snuck up on him \u2014 and it packs a punch\nOver an astonishingly short period, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has transformed himself from a competent but uninspired \"California liberal\" to a piercing voice cutting through the MAGA music and crypto techno otherwise drowning out this summer.\nIn so doing, Newsom has become our most necessary American, the country's ego to President Donald Trump's id.\nReasonable people can differ in pegging the precise point at which the California governor turned a corner. Some might say the spark first ignited during Trump's visit to Los Angeles after the fires, when Newsom set an uncompromising and unflinching non-political tone.\nOthers may nod to the objection and subsequent litigation over National Guard troops roaming those same LA streets. Perhaps it took right up until he said, \"No more,\" and promised to redistrict California in response to Trump's Texas power play.\nWhile people quibble, all can agree that Newsom is now meeting the moment, whether it is a press conference on the new California initiative, the now nearly inevitable political showdown going forward, or the elegant all-cap trolling on Xitter, tweets with a familiar syncopation and beguiling iteration, matching Trump word for incoherent word. Newsom has this.\nHe is now the post-MAGA \"GCN,\" and only starting to roar. But it took a president on the prowl of democracy to put him in the hunt.\nThe single most remarkable thing about Trump 2.0 is not the pace at which he is tearing down our hopes for the republic's health; that project was in the works and has been campaigned on since 2021.\nNo, the most shocking development has been the Democrats' mealy-mouthed retreat from center ground, the humiliating hole in space presumed to be covered by our Congressional representation. Whether it was Chuck Schumer's cave on the debt ceiling or Hakeem Jeffries's lukewarm resistance, the voiceless opposition has never been so muted.\nEnter Newsom.\nA year ago, all of this would have seemed laughable. On the national scene, Newsom \u2014 however competent and likable \u2014 was seen at best to be a placeholder for a nation too immature and insufficiently desperate to call on Pete Buttigieg to restore sanity as a 2008 redux, \"rainbow version.\"\nNewsom was, after all, a \"California liberal,\" the death knell for any part of the country east of the Sierras. Moreover, Gavin may as well be a \"Clinton,\" having been on the political scene for decades with nary a memorable noise at a Democratic convention, primary, or campaign. That was then.\nIt took Trump morphing into \"New Trump\" to bring out the fight in Gavin Newsom. And fight he has.\nRight.\nDemocrats and Independents need this. Even saintly Joe Biden, circa 2020, failed to really capture an all-things-anti-Trump national zeitgeist. Scan the coast-to-coast \"room\" and point to Trump's most formidable foe right now. There is only one person rising to today's demand.\nOne is tempted to consider whether anyone else even wants to speak up. Wouldn't it be wonderful if it were hard to point to Trump's primary opposition? If we had governors east-west-up-down and a Congress full of energy and offense? We don't, but we do have Gavin. And just perhaps he is enough, especially if he unifies.\nNot a moment too soon, it was Newsom who picked Democrats' lower lips from the floor after Texas announced its Trump-mandated redistricting plan with a \"fight fire with fire\" hot response, one that stunned Republicans used to Democrats only pouting about the travesty of it all while holding to an ideal of which, at least right now, is not an option. Newsom knows this all too well and perhaps stunned just as many Democrats in his abrupt, unexpected shot \u2014 finally.\nNo, no one should anoint Newsom as positioned as anything heading toward 2028; the first order is saving a meaningful vote at all. But he is \"our\" candidate for 2025 and '26, anointed or self-appointed, and in whom our support is best placed.\nHe has the strength to back up any plan. Grok puts California's $4.5 trillion GDP as the fourth biggest in the world. Trump and MAGA badly need that economy to flourish to keep the nation afloat, especially amidst glum economic news and tariffs hanging over us, particularly in the Midwest. The governor can cause misery for Trump through any number of moves. Unlike others, he has the necessary leverage.\nNewsom needs to expand his national footprint. Fortunately, he can best protect his state by enveloping that other nation, the red-white-and-blue middle to the blood-letting red right. Take the moment into next week, next month, and definitely next year.\nHe needs to highlight his national super-PAC, \"Campaign for Democracy,\" but brand it with his name, the one that matters, and buff it out, build the meme in the moment. Find his own billionaires, sic \"Bernie-bros\" at the cryptos, rally women \u2014 the most discerning Dems, go on Meidas and Rogan, pocket money while unleashing opposition, and for God's sake, keep up with the masterful social media. Fund all things opposition on a national scale.\nWe need someone, and it appears to be him. Good.\nIt is hard to \"come from nowhere\" when coming from California. Yet, weirdly, it feels as though he has. Perhaps it is because the bar has been set so low. Which is not to say that Newsom isn't rising. In a nation dominated by fear flowing from those outside of Trump's domination, he seems to revel in it. Amazingly, where he came from couldn't matter less, only that he came at all.\nSomeone finally grasped the reins. It behooves all of us to meet him in this moment and throughout this county. He is the leader the nation most needs, the now all-too-necessary American.\n- Jason Miciak is an American attorney, past Associate Editor of Occupy Democrats, author, and can also be found on Politizoom."

      "text": "Trump's glittering monstrosity could be his doom\nThe Washington Post recently published an article in which it noted that any chance President Donald Trump has to complete his $200 million \"golden ballroom\" at the White House in the near term would necessarily require wholly dodging years-long federal rules and regulations that would otherwise oversee such a project.\nDemocrats should silently cheer such frenetic desecration in homage to the purely pragmatic, a means to best bring about the last good chance to normalize the republic. Build it, and we will all come \u2014 history has a ready precedent.\nAn inclination to green-light this monstrosity may run counter to every preconceived notion of responsible stewardship, but Americans who are looking to end the encampment of a man who already breezily talks about 2028 should hope that he rams the plans through as thoroughly and recklessly as he did the gift of a new personalized 747 jet.\nOther than perhaps the Epstein files, the inchoate ballroom may represent the biggest threat to the Trump administration, a standing monument to opulence in trying times, and an undeniable middle finger to America's struggling working class \u2014 a massive percentage of Trump's base.\nIf one begins by noting that Trump has never committed to peacefully leaving office, it is incumbent to start considering scenarios by which Trump might leave, short of a battle. Any efficient and effective solution necessarily involves cratering support among what was formerly his strongest political hold \u2014 MAGA men.\nWe have yet to see a Trump scandal shake MAGA man's confidence and loyalty to Trump, and it is wrong to presume that a sufficiently large scandal exists, even one involving Jeffrey Epstein. Picture it now: \"It's all made-up evidence, a hoax!\" No, the only sure means by which MAGA will turn on Trump is irrefutable evidence that he first turned on them.\nEnter two converging realities.\nOne, that ballroom looks like it is going to get built. Trump doesn't usually just float development ideas. They have obliterated the Rose Garden, put up a tennis complex, and gilded the Oval Office. Trump is already making the place his personal palace (A scary enough premise).\nTwo, perhaps you've noticed, inflation hasn't gone away \u2014 indeed, it seems to be increasing, especially grocery prices. This is particularly bad news for Trump since he made grocery prices one of his signature campaign promises, and, of course, we all eat, rich and poor alike.\nThere is a reason every presidential campaign focuses on \"kitchen table issues.\" The economy drives the mind of the body politic. The typical MAGA man has learned to endure nearly every type of Trump scandal, but he has never had to defend Trump on such weak ground, a shrinking economy.\nIndeed, one of the few political threats to Trump can only come to fruition when and if he becomes a real threat to MAGA man's stability, his economic well-being. Simply triggering the libs has largely run its course anyway. No, they want him working for them; he's \"their\" president, they say.\nPresidents can and do survive hard economic times, but only when the voters believe that the president understands that things are bad and is working to fix them. We know that Trump appreciates at least that reality: he fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after one particularly concerning jobs report, a decision he may soon very much regret. Dismissing the messenger and denying the problem exists belies someone more invested in creating his own reality than fixing ours.\nAmericans not only understand reality but are forced to create it, never more so than when grappling with sending kids to school, debating whether to buy a home, or planning a retirement. Most Americans have never been to a ballroom, don't care if they ever do, much less relate to ever wanting one, never mind build it. On those two or three occasions in a life when we might need a ballroom, we rent and decorate halls.\nVery little says \"out of touch\" quite like prioritizing a project that inherently looks like personal ownership of the White House, extravagant luxury, devastatingly out of touch, and \u2014 most damaging \u2014 now out of MAGA man's reach.\nTrump looks to be building a Versailles-like ballroom at the worst possible time from his perspective, as if history has nothing to teach at all on the subject. Indeed, for once, we should be grateful that Trump remains wholly ignorant of past lessons because his decision to build entails such poor timing, such self-indulgent priorities, such reckless disregard for those he considers his people, that all in opposition should [silently] hope that he breaks sacred ground and that audacious and ostentatious plans are released with blissfully ignorant enthusiasm.\nTo the extent there is an argument that such desecration of a national treasure must be avoided at all costs, it should only be made while noting that there's no evidence that Trump believes the law dictates when he leaves.\nIf there is another side, another hope for American democracy, it involves cratering support from the people who make Trump possible. To that end, the plans for the ballroom may be more dangerous to Trump than anything found in the Epstein files \u2014 defending that type of scandal comes second nature to MAGA voters now anyway.\nThese same voters have never been asked to defend Trump through a major economic downturn, and nothing, nothing, says \"I don't care\" quite like the plans for a ballroom juxtaposed against such worry. We can debate whether Trump really ever cared about his voters, but that misses the point. A ballroom in such times means he now resents them.\nThe last people who built a Versailles-like ballroom made a similar miscalculation. The faster and more outrageously this thing is built, the less economic pain it will take to bring about a political matter/anti-matter end, the ultimate bonfire of the vanities.\nBuild it, and even they will come.\n- Jason Miciak is an American attorney, former associate editor for Occupy Democrats, and current part-time columnist for Politizoom"

      "text": "Wildly unpopular Trump policy forces him to break a 'half-century tradition': DC insider\nPresident Donald Trump spent months aggressively pushing his \"big, beautiful bill,\" telling members of Congress what he wanted the megabill to include, and warning Republican lawmakers that there would be hell to pay if they voted \"no.\" But one thing Trump didn't release in the spring was release a fully detailed federal budget.\nIn an op-ed published by the New York Times early Saturday morning, August 23, Thomas Khan (acting director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University and ex-staff director of the House Budget Committee) argues that Trump is breaking a half-century-old government tradition in budgetary planning. And he wonders if Trump is doing so because his economic policies are wildly unpopular.\n\"For the past half-century,\" Khan explains, \"presidents of both parties have, almost without exception, released a comprehensive federal budget proposal to Congress each year. The Trump Administration is poised to break that tradition. In May, months after a full proposal would be typically released, the administration offered what it called a 'skinny budget': an outline of spending priorities that detailed only a small fraction of proposed expenditures. But the administration has declined so far to release a full proposal.\"\nREAD MORE: MAGA is panicking as Trump finally meets his match\nThe former House Budget Committee staff director continues, \"Last month, Russell Vought, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, assured a group of reporters that the administration was 'certainly going to release a full budget eventually,\u201d but he also seemed to indicate the opposite when he added that releasing one 'wasn\u2019t in our interest.' He claimed that the administration didn\u2019t want to confuse the American people by releasing a full budget proposal during debate over the 'big, beautiful bill,' Mr. Trump's signature domestic legislation \u2014 even though the legislation had passed weeks earlier\u2026. Mr. Trump\u2019s administration submitted a comprehensive budget proposal every year of his first term. So why the secrecy now?\"\nVought was a key architect of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's blueprint for a second Trump Administration. During the 2024 presidential election, Trump made a point of distancing himself from Project 2025 \u2014 as it was full of unpopular proposals and his campaign saw it as a political liability for him. But Vought is now in charge of OMB.\nSeven months into Trump's second presidency, Khan believes his administration is being secretive about the national budget.\n\"If the administration's fiscal agenda is as unpopular as its domestic policy law \u2014 with further tax cuts for the wealthy and deeper cuts to Medicaid and other popular programs \u2014 then hiding it may indeed serve the administration\u2019s interest,\" Khan argues. \"Last month, for example, Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, said that new savings accounts for newborns included in the domestic policy law could be 'a backdoor for privatizing Social Security' \u2014 a claim at odds with Mr. Trump's repeated promises to protect the program. Mr. Bessent quickly tried to backtrack, offering assurances that Social Security would not be replaced.\"\nREAD MORE: 'Fumbling' Trump\u2019s Epstein problem explodes as his base has second thoughts about electing him\nKhan adds, \"This mixed messaging underscores the need for a full budget proposal. If Mr. Trump plans to break his promise to protect Social Security \u2014 much as he did with Medicaid, which he slashed despite assurances that he wouldn\u2019t \u2014 the American people deserve to know. Failing to release a comprehensive plan only fuels speculation and prevents a necessary policy debate. The skinny budget released in May is deficient.\"\nREAD MORE: Bill Maher hits raw nerve with detailed warning of Trump's 'slow-moving coup'\nThomas Khan's full New York Times op-ed is available at this link (subscription required)."
