The company said this offering enables institutional traders to access Binance\u2019s trading universe and liquidity while maintaining their assets in Sygnum\u2019s institutional-grade custody.\n\nAs for BBVA, it was reported in June that the bank was advising its wealthy clients to invest between 3% and 7% of their portfolios in the cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether.",

      "text": "Following the collapse of two crypto-friendly American banks, European lenders are reportedly filling that space.\nAs Bloomberg News reported Tuesday (July 23), two Swiss banks \u2014 Amina Bank and Sygnum Bank \u2014 have recently launched real-time payment and settlement networks, targeting a gap left by the closure of Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) and Signature Bank\u2019s Signet platform.\nBefore their collapse in March of last year, those banks played a key role in providing liquidity to the crypto market, the report said.\nSEN facilitated $117 billion in transfers in the quarter before Silvergate voluntarily liquidated, while Signet processed $275.5 billion before Signature was taken over by U.S. regulators.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the end of those networks left bitcoin liquidity even worse off than it was following the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX in 2022.\nNow, crypto players are still seeking alternatives. Amina and Sygnum, both of which went live in recent weeks, are hoping to fill that void, offering a 24/7 network for instant transactions in both fiat currencies and cryptoassets, with no fees for transfers between network members.\nThe aim is to help crypto companies \u201cexecute trades and settle positions more quickly,\u201d said Kok Kee Chong, chief executive of Singapore-based crypto exchange AsiaNext, which has partnered with Sygnum Connect.\n\u201cThis improves market liquidity, as traders can respond to market movements in real-time without having to wait for settlement,\u201d he added.\nMeanwhile, PYMNTS wrote earlier this month on the state of the crypto industry as it struggles to gain wider acceptance.\nThat report pointed to research by PYMNTS Intelligence showing \u201cthat using cryptocurrencies for cross-border payments could be the winning use case that the sector has been looking for.\u201d\nAccording to the research, blockchain-based cross-border solutions, particularly stablecoins, are being increasingly embraced by companies seeking a better way to transact and expand internationally. The Solana network processed $1.4 trillion in stablecoin cross-border payments this past March alone \u2014 a sign of the technology\u2019s scalability.\nAt the same time, the industry continues to argue that regulators such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) need to provide more regulatory clarity.\n\u201cWhat we are seeing, where it\u2019s the U.K., Japan, Singapore \u2026 even the European Union, more than two dozen countries have come together to provide a framework for crypto regulation,\u201d Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said last week. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that we as a country can\u2019t get that framework in place. And instead, we have this interminable litigation coming from the SEC that really isn\u2019t solving the problem.\u201d"

      "text": "The share depends on the client\u2019s risk appetite, Philippe Meyer, head of digital and blockchain solutions at BBVA Switzerland, said while speaking at the DigiAssets conference in London, Reuters reported Tuesday (June 17).\n\u201cWith private customers, since September last year, we started advising on bitcoin,\u201d Meyer said, according to the report. \u201cThe riskier profile, we allow up to 7% of [portfolios in] crypto.\u201d\nMeyer told Reuters on the sidelines of the event that BBVA has been executing on clients\u2019 requests to buy cryptocurrencies since 2021 and that he believes it is now one of the first large global banks to advise wealth clients to buy them.\nWhile BBVA currently advises clients to add only bitcoin or ether, it plans to add other cryptocurrencies later this year, Meyer said, per the report.\n\u201cIf you look at a balanced portfolio, if you introduce 3% you already boost the performance,\u201d Meyer told Reuters. \u201cAt 3% you are not taking a huge risk.\u201d\nThe mainstreaming of digital assets was one of the most significant developments within banking during the first half of 2025, PYMNTS reported in May.\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in May that the bank now offers its clients access to bitcoin.\nDimon announced this at the bank\u2019s annual investor day, while reiterating his own skepticism about digital currency.\n\u201cWe are going to allow you to buy it,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to custody it. We\u2019re going to put it in statements for clients.\u201d\nIt was reported in May that Banco Santander SA is considering offering a stablecoin and providing its digital bank\u2019s retail clients with access to cryptocurrencies.\nThe surge in the price of bitcoin has left smaller banks facing urgent decisions around crypto, PYMNTS reported in May.\nWhile major financial institutions have the capacity to rapidly accelerate their adoption and integration of crypto technologies, as well as the heft and governance to handle the sector\u2019s many risks, smaller community banks could find themselves lagging in emergent on-chain financial services."
