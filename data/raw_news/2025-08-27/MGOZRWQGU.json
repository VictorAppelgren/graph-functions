  "content": "Stanley Black & Decker's (NYSE:SWK) stock is up by a considerable 14% over the past three months. However, we decided to pay close attention to its weak financials as we are doubtful that the current momentum will keep up, given the scenario. In this article, we decided to focus on Stanley Black & Decker's ROE. Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early. The formula for return on equity is: So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Stanley Black & Decker is: 5.3% = US$478m \u00f7 US$9.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.05. See our latest analysis for Stanley Black & Decker What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes. A Side By Side comparison of Stanley Black & Decker's Earnings Growth And 5.3% ROE On the face of it, Stanley Black & Decker's ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 12% either. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 47% seen by Stanley Black & Decker over the last five years is not surprising. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a very high payout ratio, or is faced with competitive pressures. However, when we compared Stanley Black & Decker's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 17% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Stanley Black & Decker fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide. Stanley Black & Decker's very high LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 103% over the last three years suggests that the company is paying its shareholders more than what it is earning and this explains the company's shrinking earnings. Paying a dividend higher than reported profits is not a sustainable move. Our risks dashboard should have the 3 risks we have identified for Stanley Black & Decker. Additionally, Stanley Black & Decker has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 52% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Stanley Black & Decker's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 11%, over the same period. Overall, we would be extremely cautious before making any decision on Stanley Black & Decker. Specifically, it has shown quite an unsatisfactory performance as far as earnings growth is concerned, and a poor ROE and an equally poor rate of reinvestment seem to be the reason behind this inadequate performance. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

  "summary": "Stanley Black & Decker's (NYSE:SWK) stock has risen by 14% over the past three months, but it is being questioned whether this growth will continue. The company's Return on Equity (ROE) is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. ROE is a measure of profitability based on how much of its profits are reinvested or retained, and this can determine the company's future ability to generate profits. However, while ROE has been poor compared to the industry's average of 12%, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 17% in the same period. The high LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio over the last three years suggests that the company is paying its shareholders more than what it is earning, which could explain the shrinking earnings. Furthermore, the company has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, indicating that management is determined to pay dividends even if it hinders earnings growth.",

  "argos_summary": "Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s share price has risen about 14% in the last three months, but the company\u2019s fundamentals are weak: its ROE is only 5.3%, far below the industry average of 12%, and earnings have fallen 46% over the past five years. A high payout ratio of 103% and significant net losses have eroded shareholder value, while analysts warn that the current momentum may not sustain. Forecasts suggest a rebound, with earnings expected to grow 35% annually and ROE projected to rise to 11% over the next three years, but investors are advised to remain cautious until the company\u2019s profitability and margin improvement materialize.",
