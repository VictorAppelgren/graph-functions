  "content": "But this one might be as unfortunate as it gets.\n\nWTOC 11, a local television station in Savannah, made a big mistake in flubbing the name of Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr. in a broadcast chyron on Wednesday, swapping out the X at the end of his name for an S.\n\nThe anatomical mistake was inevitable given Penix\u2019s high-profile job.\n\nIf his career with the Falcons goes as the franchise hopes, it likely isn\u2019t the last time it happens.\n\nAtlanta drafted Penix with the No. 8 overall pick in 2024 out of Washington just a month after signing veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins to a four-year, $180 million contract.\n\nPenix took Cousins\u2019 starting spot late last season, and comes into 2025 with the job full-time.\n\nThe spelling oopsie came after the quarterback was involved in a brawl with the Titans during a joint practice on Wednesday.\n\nThe second-year signal-caller had just unloaded a deep touchdown pass to wide receiver Ray-Ray McCloud III when a scrum broke out and players from both sidelines joined the melee.\n\n\u201cThey had a lot of words throughout practice, so I gave my words and went a little bit too far. I don\u2019t know. [But] that was somebody else.\u201d Penix said said of the incident.\n\nLast season, Penix started three games and appeared in five.\n\nAs a rookie, he completed 58.5 percent of his passes, hitting on 61-of-105 attempts for 775 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions.\n\nPenix also rushed for one TD.",

      "text": "The NFL can be put on trial over civil claims that Brian Flores and other Black coaches face discrimination, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday, rejecting the league\u2019s attempt to force Flores into arbitration with Commissioner Roger Goodell as the arbitrator.\nThe 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan upheld Judge Valerie Caproni\u2019s ruling that Flores can proceed with claims against the league and three teams: the Denver Broncos, the New York Giants and the Houston Texans.\nIn a decision written by Circuit Judge Jose A. Cabranes, the appeals court said the NFL\u2019s arbitration rules forcing Flores to submit his claims to arbitration before Goodell do not have the protection of the Federal Arbitration Act because it \u201cprovides for arbitration in name only.\u201d\nThe 2nd Circuit said the NFL constitution\u2019s arbitration provision \u201ccontractually provides for no independent arbitral forum, no bilateral dispute resolution, and no procedure.\u201d\n\u201cInstead, it offends basic presumptions of our arbitration jurisprudence\u201d by forcing claims to be decided by the NFL\u2019s \u201cprincipal executive officer,\u201d the appeals court said.\nNFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy said: \u201cWe respectfully disagree with the panel\u2019s ruling, and will be seeking further review.\u201d\nMessages for comment were sent to lawyers who argued before the appeals court.\nIn February 2022, Flores sued the league and several teams, saying the league was \u201crife with racism,\u201d particularly in its hiring and promotion of Black coaches.\nTwo other coaches later joined the lawsuit, which seeks to proceed as a class action, although Caproni ruled that their claims could go to arbitration based on the language in contracts they signed with teams.\nAfter filing his lawsuit, Flores said he believed he was risking the coaching career he loves by suing the NFL, but he said it was worth it for generations to come if he could succeed in challenging systemic racism in the league.\nFlores is currently the defense coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings after working previously as a coach for the New England Patriots from 2008 to 2018, the Miami Dolphins from 2019 to 2021 and the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2022. He joined the Vikings in 2023.\nCaproni said in a March 2023 decision that descriptions by the coaches of their experiences of racial discrimination in a league with a \u201clong history of systematic discrimination toward Black players, coaches, and managers \u2014 are incredibly troubling.\u201d\n\u201cAlthough the clear majority of professional football players are Black, only a tiny percentage of coaches are Black,\u201d she said."

I don\u2019t know. [But] that was somebody else.\u201d Penix said after practice, according to Sports Illustrated.\nPenix emerged from the skirmish uninjured, although his teammates had to come to his aid, per ESPN.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where I was at in it,\u201d Penix said, according to the outlet. \u201cIt was a lot of people. I knew I was down there somewhere. I wasn\u2019t the only one, though.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad they did, because obviously that\u2019s not something that we want to be doing in practice,\u201d Penix continued. \u201cWe want to get all reps in, get that good work in. But it went how it went. But to see the team have my back and they were there, make sure they protect me. A lot of guys asked me if I was good, and it was good to know that those guys had my back.\u201d\nFalcons quarterback coach DJ Williams told ESPN the team would rather not have its QB1 getting into fights on the field, but took \u201csome positive out of it.\u201d\n\u201cLike you saw the guys take up for him, and I think that speaks to his leadership and who he is in that locker room,\u201d Williams said. \u201cObviously as coaches we\u2019re upstairs, they\u2019re downstairs. We don\u2019t really see a lot, but obviously he has a relationship and the trust of the guys because everybody ran to his defense. So, I think that\u2019s a good thing for the Falcons.\u201d\nPenix, who was drafted No. 8 overall by the Falcons in 2024, is entering his first full season as Atlanta\u2019s starting quarterback.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s about, you know, protecting your brothers. That I grew up on,\u201d Penix said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got each other\u2019s backs to ride with each other, right or wrong.\u201d"

      "text": "Bodybuilding champion Hayley McNeff died last Friday, with the news confirmed on Wednesday.\nShe was 37.\nAccording to an obituary published on Boston.com, the death of the Concord, Mass., native was \u201cunexpected but peaceful.\u201d\n\u201cHayley was like a beam of light in this world. She had boundless energy and was very determined to achieve whatever she set out to do,\u201d Hayley\u2019s dad, Dave, told People in a statement. \u201cShe set her sights on bodybuilding and fitness and achieved the highest success that sector offered. She loved us and we love Hayley very much, we miss her madly.\u201d\nMcNeff\u2019s family is set to hold a service on Saturday and has asked for attendees to make a donation to the National Alliance on Mental Illness in McNeff\u2019s honor.\nPer the obituary, McNeff graduated from Concord-Carlisle High School and University of Massachusetts Amherst, and was an accomplished bodybuilder in the 2000s with state titles in Maryland and Delaware. She was also part of the 2005 documentary \u201cRaising the Bar,\u201d which highlights the world of the sport.\n\u201cThe quest for getting huge will never end,\u201d McNeff said about her career in the documentary. \u201cThere\u2019s no limit. I hope there\u2019s a day that I\u2019ll be able to look in the mirror 100% of the time and be like, \u2018Yeah man, I\u2019m huge.'\u201d\nAfter retirement from the sport, McNeff decided to pursue a graduate degree in psychology.\n\u201cShe had a gift for making those around her laugh and feel welcomed,\u201d the obituary reads. \u201cHer energy and determination was a constant in her life and she always accomplished what she set out to achieve. She treasured her friendships and nurtured strong, lasting relationships with those who knew her best. Hayley will be deeply missed by her parents, siblings, extended family, and friends.\u201d\nUpon hearing the news of McNeff\u2019s death, bodybuilding coach Dave Palumbo posted a tribute message on Instagram.\n\u201cI\u2019m sad to hear of the passing of former woman bodybuilder @hayleysmash (HAYLEY MCNEFF) \u2026 she left us way too soon,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShe was a good soul, super intelligent and had tremendous potential as a bodybuilder. She appeared in @dave_pulcinella RAISING THE BAR videos back in the day and I was proud to be able to call her a friend. Prayers to her family and friends. R.I.P. @official_rxmuscle.\u201d\nMcNeff is one of many bodybuilders who have recently passed away.\nZunila Hoyos Mendez died at 43 in June after she was killed in a hammer attack. A month prior, Gui Bull died at 30."
