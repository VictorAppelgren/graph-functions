  "description": "The United States on Thursday doubled its bounty for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to $50 million, ramping up pressure on the authoritarian leader that began during the first Trump administration.",
  "content": "Aug. 7 (UPI) -- The United States on Thursday doubled its bounty for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to $50 million, ramping up pressure on the authoritarian leader that began during the first Trump administration.\n\nThe U.S. Departments of State and Justice announced the increased reward, stating that the fortune will go to anyone with information that leads to the arrest and/or conviction of Maduro.\n\nIn a recorded statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi said it was an \"historic\" reward, accusing Maduro of using drug cartels that the Trump administration has designated as foreign terrorists to smuggle narcotics -- and violence -- into the United States.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration has seized 30 tons of cocaine that Bondi said is connected to Maduro and his associates and nearly 7 tons linked directly to the Venezuelan president, Bondi said, adding that her Justice Department has confiscated some $700 million of Maduro-linked assets, including two private jets.\n\n\"He is one of the largest narcotraffickers in the world, and a threat to our national security,\" she said.\n\n\"Under President Trump's leadership, Maduro will not escape justice and he will be held accountable for his despicable crimes.\"\n\nVenezuela has rebuked the accusations, with Caracas' foreign minister, Yvan Gil Pinto, describing the Trump administration's reward as \"pathetic\" and \"the most ridiculous smoke screen we have ever seen.\"\n\n\"This lady puts on a media circus to please Venezuela's defeated far right,\" he said in a statement on Telegram, referring to Bondi.\n\n\"Her show is a joke -- a desperate distraction from her own miseries. The dignity of our homeland is not for sale. We repudiate this crude political propaganda operation.\"\n\nMaduro was a target of the first Trump administration's failed so-called maximum pressure campaign of sanctions and political pressure to coerce the Venezuelan leader to step down after his re-election to another six-year term in late 2018 was deemed illegitimate.\n\nIn 2020, the United States charged Maduro, and other members of his regime, with being a leader of the Cartel de los Soles Venezuelan drug-smuggling gang, with the State Department at the time offering up to $15 million for information that could lead to his arrest and conviction.\n\nThat bounty was then increased to $25 million during the final days of the Biden administration, which had tried to usher in a democratic shift in the country, in retaliation as evidence showed he had lost the July 2024 presidential election.\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has led an administration focused on the border and immigration, seeking to stop migrants and drugs entering the United States and working to deport migrants already here.\n\nLatin American gangs have been a focus of this effort, with the State Department in February designating five of them, including the Venezuelan cartel Tren de Aragua, as foreign terrorist organizations and specially designated global terorrists.\n\nTrump then in a mid-March executive order claimed that TDA was \"perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States,\" in order to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to mass-deport Venezuelans -- a move that has since been blocked by the courts.",

I\u2019m pleased to announce the Department\u2019s designation of eight organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) and Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs). As President Trump said in Executive Order 14157, cartels and other transnational organizations \u201cthreaten the safety of the American people, the security of the United States, and the stability of the international order in the Western Hemisphere.\u201d The State Department announces the designation of Tren de Aragua, Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13), C\u00e1rtel de Sinaloa, C\u00e1rtel de Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n, C\u00e1rtel del Noreste (formerly Los Zetas), La Nueva Familia Michoacana, C\u00e1rtel de Golfo (Gulf Cartel), and C\u00e1rteles Unidos as FTOs and SDGTs. The intent of designating these cartels and transnational organizations as terrorists is to protect our nation, the American people, and our hemisphere. That means stopping the campaigns of violence and terror by these vicious groups both in the United States and internationally. These designations provide law enforcement additional tools to stop these groups. Terrorist designations play a critical role in our fight against terrorism and are an effective way to curtail support for terrorist activities. Today\u2019s actions taken by the State Department demonstrate the Trump Administration\u2019s commitment to protecting our national security interests and dismantling these dangerous organizations.

      "text": "Multilateral Action Maintains Pressure on Maduro and his Representatives\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Today, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is sanctioning eight Venezuelan officials who lead key economic and security agencies enabling Nicolas Maduro\u2019s repression and subversion of democracy in Venezuela. The individuals sanctioned, pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13692, as amended, include the president of Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A., (PdVSA), Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company, and Maduro\u2019s Minister of Transportation and president of the Venezuelan Consortium of Aeronautical Industries and Air Services (CONVIASA), the state-owned airline. In addition, OFAC is sanctioning high-level Venezuelan officials in the military and police who lead entities with roles in carrying out Maduro\u2019s repression and human rights abuses against democratic actors.\nAlongside similar actions taken today by partners, including Canada, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, OFAC\u2019s designations demonstrate a message of solidarity with the Venezuelan people, and further elevate international efforts to maintain pressure on Maduro and his representatives.\n\u201cSince last year\u2019s election, Maduro and his associates have continued their repressive actions in Venezuela,\u201d said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. \u201cThe United States, together with our likeminded partners, stands in solidarity with the Venezuelan people\u2019s vote for new leadership and rejects Maduro\u2019s fraudulent claim of victory.\u201d\nIn the months since the Venezuelan presidential elections on July 28, 2024, the United States and its allies in the region have pushed Maduro to commit to a democratic transition. Instead, Maduro and his representatives have continued their violent repression in an attempt to maintain power, and have ignored the Venezuelan people\u2019s calls from for democratic accountability.\nConcurrently, as part of the Narcotics Rewards Program, the Department of State is increasing the reward offers to up to $25 million each for information leading to the arrest and/or convictions of Maduro and Maduro\u2019s named Minister of Interior, Justice, and Peace Diosdado Cabello, as well as adding a new reward of up to $15 million for Maduro\u2019s named Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino. The Department of State also imposed new visa restrictions under Presidential Proclamation 9931 on Maduro-aligned officials who have undermined the electoral process in Venezuela and are responsible for acts of repression.\nVENEZUELAN OFFICIALs FROM STATE-OWNED ENTITIES AND MINISTRIES\nThe following Venezuelan officials of state-owned entities and ministries are being designated pursuant to E.O. 13692, \u201cBlocking Property and Suspending Entry of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Venezuela,\u201d as amended, for being a current or former official of the Government of Venezuela.\nHector Andres Obregon Perez (Obregon) was named by Maduro in August 2024 as president of Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PdVSA), Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company and a primary source of Venezuela\u2019s income and foreign currency. OFAC sanctioned PdVSA in January 2019. Previously, Obregon was the executive vice president of PdVSA. Obregon also served as director general of the office of the Ministry of Communication and Information, general director of the Autonomous Service of Registries and Notaries, president of the Venezuelan Foreign Trade Corporation, and president of the Economic and Social Development Bank.\nRamon Celestino Velasquez Araguayan (Velasquez) has served as Maduro\u2019s Minister of Transportation since May 2023. Velasquez also is the president of the Venezuelan Consortium of Aeronautical Industries and Air Services (CONVIASA), the U.S.-sanctioned Venezuelan state-owned airline.\nFelix Ramon Osorio Guzman (Osorio) was named on November 12, 2024 as vice minister of Interior Policy and Legal Security of Maduro\u2019s Interior Ministry. Previously, Osorio served as commander general of the Bolivarian Army of Venezuela. The Bolivarian Army is one of the components of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela (FANB, its Spanish acronym).\nVENEZUELAN POLICE and MILITARY OFFICIALS\nThe following Venezuelan police and military officials are being designated pursuant to\nE.O. 13692, \u201cBlocking Property and Suspending Entry of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Venezuela,\u201d as amended, for being a current or former official of the Government of Venezuela.\nDanny Ramon Ferrer Sandrea (Ferrer) was named on November 12, 2024 as vice minister of the Integrated System of Penal Investigations of Maduro\u2019s Interior Ministry. In this role, Ferrer has been responsible for the evaluation, control, and supervision of investigative police units, including the Scientific, Penal, and Criminal Investigations Corps (CICPC, its Spanish acronym) and the National Service of Forensic Medicine and Sciences. The CICPC is Venezuela\u2019s largest national police agency.\nDouglas Arnoldo Rico Gonzalez (Rico) has served as director of CICPC since February 2016. The CICPC has reportedly committed systematic human rights abuses in Venezuela, including extrajudicial killings and arbitrary arrests. Rico was sanctioned by the European Union for human rights abuses on April 20, 2023.\nJhonny Rafael Salazar Bello (Salazar) has served as deputy director of the CICPC since March 19, 2018. Venezuelan lawyers have made public complaints against the CICPC for human rights violations and abuses committed under Rico\u2019s and Salazar\u2019s command since the July 28, 2024 presidential election.\nManuel Enrique Castillo Rengifo (Castillo) was named on October 16, 2024 as deputy commander of the Strategic Operations Command (CEOFANB, its Spanish acronym) of the FANB. Previously, Castillo served as commander of Strategic Regions for Integral Defense Los Andes. The CEOFANB is one of FANB\u2019s six branches, whose mandate is to be the operational command for strategic operations. As the operational command of the FANB, the CEOFANB also oversees the repression tactics carried out by the FANB.\nJose Ramon Figuera Valdez (Figuera) was named on October 17, 2024 as commander of the Integral Defense Zone (ZODI, its Spanish acronym) for the Venezuelan capital district, having previously served as second-in-command of the capital district ZODI. Under Figuera\u2019s leadership, the capital district has reportedly experienced the highest levels of arbitrary detentions against protesters since the July 28, 2024 election. On July 29, 2024, at least eight protesters and bystanders were killed in the capital district, where Figuera was in command.\nSANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS\nAs a result of today\u2019s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above, and of any entities that are owned directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by them, individually, or with other blocked persons, that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC\u2019s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.\nIn addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. Violations of OFAC regulations may result in civil or criminal penalties. OFAC\u2019s Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines provide more information regarding OFAC\u2019s enforcement of U.S. sanctions, including the factors that OFAC generally considers when determining an appropriate response to an apparent violation.\nThe power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC\u2019s ability to designate and add persons to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC\u2019s Frequently Asked Question 897 here.

      "text": "March 26 (UPI) -- U.S. Attorney General William Barr announced drug trafficking charges on Thursday against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and other senior regime officials.\nThe Justice Department indictment says Maduro \"helped manage and ultimately lead\" a smuggling organization known as the Cartel of the Suns. The cartel sought to \"flood the United States with cocaine and inflict the drug's harmful and addictive effects on users in this country,\" the charges say.\nProsecutors say Maduro and cartel members \"prioritized using cocaine as a weapon against America\" and imported as much into the United States as possible.\nAccording to the indictment, Maduro's regime allowed Colombian revolutionaries to use Venezuelan airspace to fly cocaine through Central America to destinations in North America.\nRelated\nGeoffrey Berman, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the scheme has been going for two decades.\nProsecutors also say Maduro personally negotiated drug shipments and coordinated with Honduras and other countries in facilitating the illegal drug trade.\nThe others charged are National Constituent Assembly President Diosdado Cabello Rondon, former military intelligence agency Director Hugo Armando Carvajal Barrios, and leaders of the Colombian FARC revolutionary group.\nThe State Department offered a reward of up to $15 million through its Narcotics Rewards Program for information leading to the arrest of Maduro and rewards of up to $10 million each for information related to the others charged in the indictment.\n\"The Venezuelan people deserve a transparent, responsible, representative government that serves the needs of the people -- and that does not betray the trust of the people by condoning or employing public officials that engage in illicit narcotics trafficking,\" the State Department said.\nThe United States formally does not recognize Maduro as the president of Venezuela. It is one of dozens of governments that view opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president, owing to irregularities in Maduro's 2018 re-election."

      "text": "Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\nA PROCLAMATION\nTren de Aragua (TdA) is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization with thousands of members, many of whom have unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States. TdA operates in conjunction with C\u00e1rtel de los Soles, the Nicolas Maduro regime-sponsored, narco-terrorism enterprise based in Venezuela, and commits brutal crimes, including murders, kidnappings, extortions, and human, drug, and weapons trafficking. TdA has engaged in and continues to engage in mass illegal migration to the United States to further its objectives of harming United States citizens, undermining public safety, and supporting the Maduro regime\u2019s goal of destabilizing democratic nations in the Americas, including the United States.\nTdA is closely aligned with, and indeed has infiltrated, the Maduro regime, including its military and law enforcement apparatus. TdA grew significantly while Tareck El Aissami served as governor of Aragua between 2012 and 2017. In 2017, El Aissami was appointed as Vice President of Venezuela. Soon thereafter, the United States Department of the Treasury designated El Aissami as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, 21 U.S.C. 1901 et seq. El Aissami is currently a United States fugitive facing charges arising from his violations of United States sanctions triggered by his Department of the Treasury designation.\nLike El Aissami, Nicolas Maduro, who claims to act as Venezuela\u2019s President and asserts control over the security forces and other authorities in Venezuela, also maintains close ties to regime-sponsored narco-terrorists. Maduro leads the regime-sponsored enterprise C\u00e1rtel de los Soles, which coordinates with and relies on TdA and other organizations to carry out its objective of using illegal narcotics as a weapon to \u201cflood\u201d the United States. In 2020, Maduro and other regime members were charged with narcoterrorism and other crimes in connection with this plot against America.\nOver the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA. The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States. Indeed, in December 2024, INTERPOL Washington confirmed: \u201cTren de Aragua has emerged as a significant threat to the United States as it infiltrates migration flows from Venezuela.\u201d Evidence irrefutably demonstrates that TdA has invaded the United States and continues to invade, attempt to invade, and threaten to invade the country; perpetrated irregular warfare within the country; and used drug trafficking as a weapon against our citizens.\nBased upon a review of TdA\u2019s activities, and in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury, on February 20, 2025, acting pursuant to the authority in 8 U.S.C. 1189, the Secretary of State designated TdA as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\nAs President of the United States and Commander in Chief, it is my solemn duty to protect the American people from the devastating effects of this invasion. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Alien Enemies Act, 50 U.S.C. 21 et seq., hereby proclaim and direct as follows:\nSection 1. I find and declare that TdA is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States. TdA is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela. I make these findings using the full extent of my authority to conduct the Nation\u2019s foreign affairs under the Constitution. Based on these findings, and by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 50 U.S.C. 21, I proclaim that all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA, are within the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies. I further find and declare that all such members of TdA are, by virtue of their membership in that organization, chargeable with actual hostility against the United States and are therefore ineligible for the benefits of 50 U.S.C. 22. I further find and declare that all such members of TdA are a danger to the public peace or safety of the United States.\nSec. 2. I direct the Attorney General, within 60 days of the date of this proclamation, to prepare and publish a letter under her signature declaring the policy described in section 1 of this proclamation as the policy of the United States and attaching this proclamation. I direct the Attorney General to transmit this letter to the Chief Justice of the United States, the chief judge of every circuit court of appeals, the chief judge of every district and territorial court of the United States, each Governor of a State and territory of the United States, and the highest-ranking judicial officer of each State and territory of the United States.\nSec. 3. I direct that all Alien Enemies described in section 1 of this proclamation are subject to immediate apprehension, detention, and removal, and further that they shall not be permitted residence in the United States.\nSec. 4. Pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with applicable law, apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove every Alien Enemy described in section 1 of this proclamation. The Secretary of Homeland Security retains discretion to apprehend and remove any Alien Enemy under any separate authority.\nSec. 5. All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall collaborate with law enforcement officials of the United States and with appropriate State, local, and tribal officials, to use all lawful means to apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove Alien Enemies described in section 1 of this proclamation.\nSec. 6. Pursuant to my authority under 50 U.S.C. 21 to direct the conduct to be observed on the part of the United States toward the Alien Enemies subject to this proclamation, to direct the manner and degree of the restraint to which such Alien Enemies shall be subject and in what cases, to provide for the removal of such Alien Enemies, and to establish any other regulations which are found necessary \u201cin the premises and for the public safety,\u201d I hereby direct the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to execute all the regulations hereinafter contained regarding the Alien Enemies described in section 1 of this proclamation. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security are further directed to cause the apprehension, detention, and removal of all members of TdA who otherwise qualify as Alien Enemies under section 1 of this proclamation. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security are authorized to take all necessary actions under the Alien Enemies Act to effectuate this proclamation, consistent with applicable law. In doing so, and for such purpose, they are authorized to utilize agents, agencies, and officers of the United States Government and of the several States, territories, dependencies, and municipalities thereof and of the District of Columbia.
