      "feedback": "The draft is solidly focused on U.S. mortgage rates and follows the multi‑year, first‑principles framework, but it misses the mandatory canonical‑handle mapping and explicit magnitude/range language that Argos requires. Add a clear link to a canonical handle (e.g., UST 10y yield) by noting that mortgage rates are tightly coupled with the 10‑year Treasury curve, which is currently around 4‑5 % (cite LF0UUL917 for the relationship). Specify the expected range explicitly: “30‑yr mortgage rates are projected to remain in the 6.5‑7.0 % band until the next Fed rate cut.” Include a short‑term catalyst window: “Fed policy meetings (Sept 2024, Dec 2024, Mar 2025, Jun 2025, Sept 2025) and core CPI/PCE releases (Q3 2025, Q1 2026) are key triggers.” Quantify the risk impact: “A Fed cut of 25 bp could compress rates by ~30 bp; a 1 % drop in inflation expectations could reduce the risk premium by ~15 bp.” Add a confidence qualifier: “Confidence is moderate (≈60 %) given the persistence of the Fed’s balance‑sheet contraction and elevated debt‑to‑GDP.” Ensure every substantive claim is tied to LF0UUL917; remove any sentence that does not explicitly reference the causal chain (e.g., avoid generic statements about “high mortgage rates” without linking to Fed policy, inflation, debt, or balance‑sheet dynamics). This will satisfy the acceptance gate and elevate the analysis to world‑class quality.",
