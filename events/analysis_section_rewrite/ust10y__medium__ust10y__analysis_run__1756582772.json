      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Sentence drift – Adjustable‑rate mortgages (ID KX6AOMQZ5)**  \n   *Current wording:* “In addition, the rise in adjustable‑rate mortgages—now a larger share of the mortgage market—could dampen consumer spending, further pressuring earnings and valuation multiples (KX6AOMQZ5).”  \n   *Issue:* This discusses ARMs without tying the effect to the S&P 500.  \n   *Fix:* Either (a) delete the sentence or (b) rewrite to explicitly link the consumer‑spending squeeze to S&P 500 earnings/valuation (e.g., “The expanding ARM share is likely to curb consumer spending, tightening corporate earnings that drive the S&P 500’s valuation multiples (KX6AOMQZ5).”).\n\n2. **Sentence drift – Blockchain GDP release (ID XQMF22EFB)**  \n   *Current wording:* “The recent U.S. Commerce Department move to publish GDP data on nine blockchains in July 2025 could inject volatility into market sentiment as investors reassess the verifiability and timeliness of macro releases, potentially amplifying short‑term swings (XQMF22EFB).”  \n   *Issue:* This addresses a policy change unrelated to the S&P 500.  \n   *Fix:* Either (a) remove the sentence or (b) connect the volatility to S&P 500 performance (e.g., “The blockchain GDP release may heighten market volatility, potentially amplifying short‑term swings in the S&P 500 (XQMF22EFB).”).\n\n3. **Consistency of citations**  \n   Ensure every substantive claim about the S&P 500 (e.g., concentration risk, impact of tech earnings, Fed cuts) carries an inline citation to FAN5RYW6T. If you add new links (e.g., to CPI or PCE data), cite the appropriate source IDs.\n\n4. **Maintain focus**  \n   After edits, the analysis should discuss only the S&P 500’s 3–6‑month outlook, with all drivers (tech earnings, labor market, inflation, tariffs, Fed policy) explicitly tied to index performance. Remove any mention of unrelated assets or policy actions unless they can be shown to transmit to the S&P 500 via a clear causal chain.",
