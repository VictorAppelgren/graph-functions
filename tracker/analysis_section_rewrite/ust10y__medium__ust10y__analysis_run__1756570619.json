      "feedback": "**Feedback & Edit Instructions**\n\n1. **Remove Unsupported Copper Claim** – The sentence “U.S. copper tariff policy has boosted demand for U.S. copper, raising commodity prices” lacks a source. Either delete it or replace it with a citation from a credible copper‑price article (none provided).  \n2. **Add Explicit Causal Chains** – For each risk factor, spell out the transmission path. Example: *“Concentration risk → weak tech earnings → 40 % of index weight falls → 5–10 % spx decline.”* Do this for Fed‑cut/​hawk stance, inflation, and consumer‑spending squeeze.  \n3. **Ensure Every Claim is Cited** – Add inline citations for inflation figures (FAN5RYW6T), September payrolls (Z7O1DCHS7), Fed policy (Z7O1DCHS7), and tech earnings outlook (FAN5RYW6T).  \n4. **Keep Focus on spx** – While mentioning copper or ARMs is fine, keep the narrative centered on the S&P 500. Trim any peripheral discussion that dilutes the 3–6‑month spx scenario.  \n5. **Clarify Catalyst Windows** – Explicitly state the dates: *“September 5 payrolls, mid‑September Fed meeting, and the next CPI/PCE releases (Oct 2025)”* as the trigger windows.  \n6. **Quantify All Impacts** – Confirm the 5–10 % decline and 2–5 % rally ranges are tied to the spx handle.  \n7. **Add Watch‑List Signals** – List: September 5 payrolls, Fed minutes, CPI/PCE, tech earnings guidance, copper price trend (if kept), and spx volatility.  \n8. **State Confidence Levels** – Label the base case confidence as “moderate” and alternatives as “conditional on Fed shift.”  \n\nImplement these edits to meet the Argos criteria: canonical handle mapping, dated catalysts, causal clarity, and concise, actionable guidance.",
