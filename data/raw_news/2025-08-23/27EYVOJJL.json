  "title": "CA bill to give interest on insurance payments to homeowners",
  "description": "The bill states the interest for homeowners cannot be reduced through fees or charges by the loaners.",
  "content": "(The Center Square) \u2014 The California Legislature this week passed a bill to give at least 2% of interest on insurance payments to owners of homes that need rebuilding or repair from natural disasters.\n\nLegislators said they felt compelled to pass Assembly Bill 493 after thousands of Los Angeles homeowners lost their homes during the Palisades and Eaton fires in January.\n\nIn such disasters, homeowners and lenders are typically given joint checks from insurers that are then placed into escrow accounts by the lender. The funds earn interest that the lender could keep.\n\nCalifornia Assemblymember John Harabedian, D-Pasadena, the leading author of the bill, said it is important homeowners, especially the ones affected by the wildfires, benefit from the insurance payments meant to help them recover from a disaster.\n\n\u201cThis bill will ensure that thousands of dollars go back to homeowners, rather than Wall Street,\u201d Harabedian told The Center Square Thursday. \u201cThis is about fairness and protecting families when they need it most.\u201d\n\nThe bill states the interest for homeowners cannot be reduced through fees or charges by the loaners.\n\nTo secure their loan on the property, lenders often hold the insurance money in escrow to ensure homeowners use it for repairs or rebuilding, rather than something else. Lenders will usually hold onto the funds until after the property is restored if money is still owned on the loan for the property.\n\nThe bill applies to existing insurance payments being held in escrow accounts and also to new escrow accounts that open following a disaster. An interest rate at 2% will be applied starting the bill\u2019s effective date.\n\nUnder California law, lenders are already required to pay homeowners interest on funds for property taxes and insurance that are in escrow accounts, but nowhere is insurance payments explicitly mentioned. The Legislature sought to close that loophole with the bill.\n\nThe legislation is now heading over to California Gov. Gavin Newsom to be signed into law. Newsom has already voiced his support.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Gov. Newsom for his partnership on this measure, and my colleagues in the Assembly and Senate for recognizing the urgent need for this bill,\u201d Harabedian said.",

      "text": "Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) rammed two bills through the state legislature overhauling the California Environmental Quality Act, a 1970s-era law viewed by critics as spurring a housing shortage due to being one of the biggest roadblocks to \u201cbuilding anything.\u201d\nAlthough he faced fierce opposition from environmental groups, Newsom was able to sign the bills into law Monday evening by tying the legislation to the state\u2019s 2025-2026 budget legislation. A provision conditioning the governor\u2019s final approval of the spending plan on whether the legislature passed the CEQA reforms was inserted into the budget agreement. Faced with the prospect of the governor refusing to sign off on the budget agreement by a July 1 deadline if they didn\u2019t wave through Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener\u2019s Senate Bill 131 and Democratic Assemblymember Buffy Wicks Assembly Bill 130, lawmakers in both chambers voted to approve the measures, which Newsom hopes will spur development and alleviate the state\u2019s dire housing shortage.\n\u201cThis was too important to play chance,\u201d Newsom said during a signing ceremony at the Sacramento capital, where he called the bills the \u201cmost consequential housing reform that we\u2019ve seen in modern history in the state of California.\u201d\n\u201cWe have fallen prey to a strategy of delay. As a result of that, we have too much demand chasing too little supply. This is not complicated, it is Econ 101,\u201d he added. \u201cThis was too urgent, too important, to allow the process to unfold as it has for the last generation.\u201d\nThe bills mean most new apartment buildings will no longer face the open threat of environmental litigation. Proponents believe CEQA\u2019s overhaul will help relieve the housing shortage in California, which has some of the most expensive housing markets in the country and the highest homeless rates in the nation.\n\u201cThere\u2019s over 10 projects we\u2019re going to push the go button on with this exemption, probably Tuesday,\u201d Dave Rand, a prominent Southern California land-use attorney, said in comments to the Los Angeles Times.\nAssembly Bill 130 exempts most housing projects from CEQA, requiring only developers of high-rise, or buildings taller than 85 feet, and low-income developments to pay union-level wages for construction laborers.\nSenate Bill 131 narrows CEQA mandates for housing construction and further waives the environmental restrictions for some residential rezoning changes, streamlining approvals for nonresidential projects such as child care centers, health clinics, and advanced manufacturing facilities.\nCEQA, historically one of the country\u2019s strictest state-level regulatory frameworks affecting housing projects and other crucial development, was first signed into law by then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan over five decades ago.\nThe law \u201capplies to any discretionary approval that a project may need,\u201d David Blackwell, a land use and zoning attorney in San Francisco, noted in comments to Super Lawyers. \u201cPretty much any development project in California is going to require a discretionary approval from the city or the county where the project is located. And because of that, then that triggers CEQA review.\u201d\nCritics have long blamed the regulations in part for the state\u2019s struggles with vast housing shortages and homelessness. The Golden State, which has some of the strictest housing zoning regulations in the U.S., has struggled to match demand for housing with supply, leading to a growing shortage.\nNewsom has softened some of CEQA\u2019s most stringent provisions in recent years. However, although he signed legislation into law in 2023, making several changes to the CEQA, the governor in the past stopped far short of completely overhauling the controversial environmental legislation.\nIn January, he rolled out an executive order that suspended permitting and environmental reviews under CEQA in order to \u201cexpedite\u201d the rebuilding of Los Angeles, which was devastated by sweeping fires. Later the same month, Newsom blasted the California Coastal Commission, a powerful state bureaucracy, for releasing guidance suggesting residents still needed to comply with CEQA, ordering the agency to stand down through an additional executive order and condemning it for bringing \u201cconfusion and delay\u201d to rebuilding efforts in Los Angeles.\nNEWSOM CALLS OUT CALIFORNIA AGENCY FOR \u2018ERRONEOUS\u2019 REGULATIONS DELAYING REBUILDING IN LA\nAt the time, Newsom suggested the environmental rules could hamper fire victims\u2019 ability to build back their homes and businesses destroyed during the crisis, drawing criticism from residents who argued his position was an admission that the stringent regulations were never necessary in the first place.\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about issues of rebuilding as it relates to \u2026 scarcity of resources, materials, personnel. I\u2019m worried about time to getting these projects done. So we want to fast-track by eliminating any CEQA requirements,\u201d he said."

The reforms, coupled with the insurance\u2011interest bill, reflect a broader push to accelerate rebuilding and development after the state\u2019s recent wildfire crisis.",
