  "title": "Orchard Robotics, founded by a Thiel fellow Cornell dropout, raises $22M for farm vision AI ",
  "description": "The startup uses truck-mounted cameras to collect and analyze data about crop health.",
  "content": "Inspired by his grandparents, who were apple farmers in China, Charlie Wu got the idea to apply technology to agriculture while studying computer science at Cornell University, a top agriculture school.\n\n\u201cI got to meet fruit professors who are the best in the world at what they do,\u201d Wu told TechCrunch. \u201cThrough talking to them, I realized even the largest farms in the nation basically have no idea what is actually growing out in their fields.\u201d\n\nHe dropped out of Cornell, became a Thiel fellow, and in 2022 began building Orchard Robotics, a startup that uses cameras and AI to help fruit growers manage their crops more precisely.\n\nOn Wednesday, Orchard Robotics announced that it raised a $22 million Series A funding led by Quiet Capital and Shine Capital, and with participation from returning investors including General Catalyst and Contrary.\n\nAlthough the idea of using computer vision for specialty crops isn\u2019t new, Wu says that the largest farms in the US still rely on manual sampling to make critical decisions about farm operations.\n\nSince farmers inspect only a small percentage of their crops, their estimations of how many healthy fruits they have on their vineyard or orchard can be extremely imprecise.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re growing in the field, you don\u2019t know how much chemical to apply to it. You don\u2019t know how many workers to hire to harvest it. You don\u2019t know what you can actually sell and market,\u201d Wu said.\n\nOrchard\u2019s small camera attaches to tractors or farm vehicles, collecting ultra-high-resolution images about fruit health as the operator drives through the field. Those images are then analyzed by AI for fruit size, color, and health.\n\nThe data is then uploaded into Orchard\u2019s cloud-based software, which acts as a central record for making decisions such as the vines or trees that may need extra fertilization, pruning or thinning.\n\nOrchard is already in use in some of the country\u2019s largest apple and grape farms, and the startup recently began to offer its technology to blueberries, cherries, almonds, pistachios, citrus, and strawberry growers.\n\nThe company is not alone in its use of tractor-mounted cameras to leverage AI for specialty crop image analysis. Orchard\u2019s direct competitors include Bloomfield Robotics, which last year was acquired by farm equipment manufacturer Kubota, as well as seed-stage startups Vivid Robotics and Green Atlas.\n\nWu admits the existing market for fruit and vegetable data is only $1.5 billion, but he believes that future AI advancements will allow the technology to make autonomous decisions, expanding Orchard\u2019s product offerings.\n\nHe hopes Orchard\u2019s evolution mirrors that of Flock Safety, a public safety startup now valued at $7.5 billion, which over the past eight years has expanded from simply collecting license plate information to a range of other products, including gunshot detection and video surveillance.\n\n\u201cOur ambition is to be a lot more than just collecting data. We want to collect the data, then build an operating system on top of the data, and then eventually own all the workflows in the farm, and that\u2019s going to have the potential to expand our market by quite a bit,\u201d Wu said.",

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.

It integrates directly with your existing farm operations to provide a seamless, all-in-one experience.\nFAQ's\nWhat crops do you support?\nCurrently, we serve apple, grape, blueberry, and cherry farms. We are growing rapidly and adding new crops that we support every season. If you don't see what you farm, check back soon!\nWhat is the turnaround time?\nWe understand data is the bedrock of farm decision-making. Data coming in two days too late could very well mean that a critical pruning, spraying, or thinning decision is not made on time. Our FruitScope Vision Systems process data on-device, overnight, giving our growers a typical turnaround time of the very next morning. The post-processed data uploads to FruitScope OS for you to immediately begin making decisions based on your data.\nHow much does it cost?\nAccess to our technology is priced on a per-acre, per-year basis.
