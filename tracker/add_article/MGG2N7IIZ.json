      "summary": "UK 30‑year gilt yields hit a 27‑year high, pushing borrowing costs to the highest level since 1998. The rise reflects market concerns about fiscal credibility, pension‑fund demand shifts, and geopolitical tensions, and it pressures Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider tax increases or spending cuts ahead of the autumn budget. The pound fell more than 1% against the dollar, and similar upward pressure is seen on German, French and Dutch 30‑year bonds. The Bank of England’s upcoming policy decisions and the Treasury’s debt‑sale plans will shape the trajectory of yields in the near term.",
