      "summary": "Frontline reported Q2 2025 adjusted profit of $80.4 million, driven by a $40 million jump in TCE earnings and higher VLCC, Suezmax, and LR2 rates. The company’s fleet remains fully ECO‑compliant, with 82% of VLCC days booked at $38,700/day and strong liquidity of $844 million, but an order book that is effectively sold out through 2027. Management highlighted rising utilization of compliant tankers amid OPEC production reversals and increased US Gulf exports to Asia, suggesting a potential lift in freight demand. Despite a negative effective fleet growth of 0.5% in 2025, Frontline maintains solid cash‑generation potential, with a 30% spot‑market bump projected to boost annual cash flow by 64%.",
