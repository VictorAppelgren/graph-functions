  "description": "In the \u201960s the Horsman Doll Co. created look-alikes of the most famous, talked about or most whoknowswhat VIPs. How I became one of that tribe, who knows.",
  "content": "A letter to the NY Post reads in part: \u201cI have a Cindy doll that was given to me when I was a child. Somehow through various moves, the shoes are missing. Any chance she has an extra pair to complete this beautiful doll? Thank you for showing her this letter.\u201d Signed Susan.\n\nThis note triggered an odyssey, bouncing from editor to editor-in-chief to me. In the \u201960s, before Biden\u2019s first dribble, the Horsman Doll Co. created look-alikes of the most famous, talked about or most whoknowswhat VIPs. The company picked them \u2014 the people did not. How I became one of that tribe, who knows.\n\nThe Cindy dolls in my red, white and black colors, sandal shoes and dark hair looked better than I did. The no longer company was sold to a foreign manufacturer. I still own three such dolls. All have shoes.\n\nSo, Susan: Find a store that sells dolls. Buy one wearing black shoes. Go home. Lose the doll. Keep the shoes. Then glue them onto Cindy\u2019s feet. Tell us the doll\u2019s cost and I will personally immediately reimburse you. I can hardly sleep knowing my look-alike\u2019s shoeless.\n\nOther ways: The Internet can find doll hospitals, used dolls, places that sell old dolls and salable parts. Even a neighborhood shoemaker could put black leather strips together.\n\nAlso in the \u201960s Ralph Destino, then Cartier\u2019s longtime president, did a display of gold jewelry designed by me. If Susan wants anything from Cartier, I\u2019m not reimbursing her.\n\nAnother rapper in the crapper. Busta Rhymes. Being sued by his ex-personal assistant, who earned $200 a day, claims he was yelled at, smacked in his head. Says Busta busted his chops, forced him to run red lights, claims he\u2019s blacklisted in the hip-hop industry, now wants back in, plus a few quid cash. Busta says it\u2019s all false and a shakedown.\n\nOscar winner Dustin \u2014 is there another Dustin? \u2014 just turned 88. He says: \u201cI wanted to be a jazz pianist \u2014 but wasn\u2019t good enough. Went to Santa Monica City College because I lacked the credits for any university. Acting was the only way to get credits. A friend said acting was like gym \u2014 nobody fails you.\u201d\n\nOne of the royal err force\n\nComing up is \u201cEntitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York\u201d the first of 9 million Epstein books. Supposedly exposes Clinton, Prince Andrew and a partridge in a pear tree. Brit author\u2019s Andrew Lownie. It\u2019s HarperCollins. Everyone\u2019s in it.\n\nAlleging Andrew and Clinton shared the same mistress he relies on \u201cexclusive\u201d open Palm Beach throats. Listen, Palm Beach throats don\u2019t shut even to chew steak. He\u2019s even got a press agent making the rounds, asking for whoever wants to interview him.\n\nA jeweler was approached by a fund-raiser for a \u201cworthy cause.\u201d Jeweler: \u201cMy brother supports six children. My elderly sister hasn\u2019t worked in 30 years. My uncle\u2019s on relief. My father has no food. You call all that a worthy cause?\u201d Said the fund-raiser: \u201cOf course.\u201d Jeweler: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t do a damn thing for these people. Why should I do something for you?\u201d\n\nFor sure only in New York, kids, only in New York.",

There was no one like her.\u201d\nGarr died Tuesday morning in Los Angeles after a long battle with multiple sclerosis, her publicist, Heidi Schaeffer, confirmed.\nGarr played Hoffman\u2019s friend and sometimes-love interest, Sandy Lester, in the 1982 movie, \u201cTootsie.\u201d She received a best supporting actress Oscar nomination for her work.\n\u201cI was proud. The academy not only knew I existed, they thought I was good!\u201d Garr wrote of the Academy Award nod in her 2005 memoir, \u201cSpeedbumps: Flooring it Through Hollywood.\u201d\nGarr hesitated to take the \u201csecond-banana\u201d role after just playing the lead in the movie \u201cOne From The Heart,\u201d she revealed to AV Club in 2008. But director Sydney Pollack talked her into taking the job.\n\u201cHe said, \u2018We\u2019re going to make it funny. It\u2019s gonna be really good, and we\u2019re gonna take any ideas you have,'\u201d she recalled. \u201cSo I started writing stuff about her right away\u2014about Sandy Lester\u2014and he let me do it. And I loved that.\u201d\nGarr also said Hoffman was in her corner when it came to giving suggestions to Pollack.\n\u201cDustin had beaten [Sydney] into submission, so he\u2019d say, \u2018If you have an idea, tell Sydney,'\u201d Garr remembered. \u201cSo I said, \u2018Put the camera over there, and I\u2019m going to rush out of the bathroom and say, \u2018What\u2019s the matter with you people? I\u2019ve been in there for a half an hour screaming! Doesn\u2019t anybody care?\u2019 That was a good part in the movie, right? And I made that up.\u201d\nIn addition to the Pollack classic, the comedy legend was known for her role in Mel Brooks\u2019 1974 comedy \u201cYoung Frankenstein.\u201d But her resume extended far beyond those two iconic performances.\nAfter cutting her teeth in TV on shows such as \u201cStar Trek,\u201d \u201cThe Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\u201d and \u201cThe New Dick Van Dyke Show,\u201d Garr followed up her star-making turn in \u201cYoung Frankenstein\u201d with roles in Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s thriller \u201cThe Conversation\u201d and Steven Spielberg\u2019s sci-fi film \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind.\u201d\nThe actress continued working until 2011, when she starred in the TV film \u201cHow To Marry a Billionaire.\u201d\nIn 2002, Garr revealed that she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t think there was any reason to come out and say anything about it,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Larry King at the time. \u201cI think now, the good news is there is a lot of good medicine out there.\u201d\nGarr suffered a brain aneurysm in 2006, which left her in a coma for a week, though she was able to return to acting after her recovery.\nGarr is survived by her daughter, Molly O\u2019Neil, 30, and grandson, Tyryn, 6."

I would say his private future is pretty limited, too,\u201d Lownie told Sky News.\n\u201cI mean, he lives in Royal Lodge, he plays golf, watches TV, and presumably sees his grandchildren \u2026 he\u2019s living the life of a retired man.\u201d\nLownie added that one palace staffer claimed that Andrew had been most affected by the stripping of his titles.\n\u201cWhat most annoys him is his lack of a royal status. That\u2019s what really sort of gave him his whole sense of identity,\u201d he told the outlet.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s not being able to put on his uniforms and strut around and being self-important.\u201d\nAndrew\u2019s status within the royal fold quickly disappeared following his many controversies \u2014 including his close association with late convicted pedophile and financier Jeffrey Epstein, the sexual abuse lawsuit filed against him by the late Virginia Giuffre and his links to alleged Chinese spy Yang Tengbo.\nThe late Queen Elizabeth II stripped her son of his military titles and royal patronages, as well as his HRH title, in 2022. He was also forced to give up his role as a working royal.\nShortly after losing his HRH titles and military honors, Andrew\u2019s Freedom of the City of York honor was also taken away following a historic vote by councilors.\nElsewhere, Lownie has called for \u201cmore accountability from the royal family and more transparency\u201d after claiming there was a lot of secrecy behind closed doors during the research stage of his book.\nThe royal author spent four years writing his latest book, and submitted hundreds of Freedom of Information requests to government departments.\nFollow The Post\u2019s royal family live blog for the latest pics, news, exclusive details and more\nHowever, Lownie claims that his applications regarding Prince Andrew and his work bounced back for reasons unknown.\n\u201cClearly there are details that people have picked up on and run with. And you know, that\u2019s inevitable in these sort of books,\u201d he told the outlet.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re to earn our trust and support, they have to show that they are not hiding things \u2014 that they are behaving well.\u201d\n\u201cThey blame everything from security reasons, to cost and man hours, to data protection, to my questions being too broad,\u201d Lownie added.\nThe Post has reached out to Andrew\u2019s reps and Buckingham Palace for comment."

      "text": "America is antsy. Its nerves are twitching. Anger rising. Jobs changing. Lives aging, finances shrinking, homes switching, politics muddying. Its wardrobe\u2019s diminishing. Prices rising. CBS failing. CNN who cares. Stores closing. It\u2019s cranky.\nSchools fighting. Religion disappearing. English disappearing. Other languages appearing. Crazies shooting. Students marching. Kids disobeying. Foreigners entrapping. Diners in bus lanes. Commies encroaching. Drugstores getting robbed. Rules muddying. Longtime ways crumbling.\nAnd our lawmakers? Three little bears running for mayor.\nIt\u2019s become Our country tis of what? Sneakers are dress shoes. T-shirts are black-tie. Guns today are part of wardrobe. Dessert\u2019s a puff of pot. DAs let crazies go free. Roadways are for bicycles, motorcycles, deliveries, scaffolds, double parking. Movies are re-dos. Politicians are who?\nGet to packing\nResult? This summer our country\u2019s moving. Traveling. Not to Arkansas or \u2014 oy \u2014 Tennessee. The USA\u2019s schlepping abroad.\nSo, if still home scratching for day-old bagels or brownies, let Little Mother clue you about airlines today. They\u2019re negotiating. Do not tell me you don\u2019t know about it. They are newly doing as well as Biden. Hunter Biden.\nOne traveler I know well bought a low-class plane ticket. If he could buy cheapo passage stuffed inside a rubber tire, he\u2019d take it. At check-in he\u2019s told an extra charge could be tacked on if he wants to upgrade. So he pays the extra charge and his behind squats in first class across the ocean.\nThe country of Qatar bought London\u2019s USA embassy which, for some reason, needed a more secure building. The new buyers are keeping our rooftop\u2019s gilded eagle. Just telling you what I know.\nThey\u2019ve turned the building into the $2,000-a-night Grosvenor Square Chancery Rosewood Hotel. Originally designed by Eero Saarinen, who also did JFK\u2019s TWA terminal, it\u2019ll open to guests in a few weeks.\nParis is dressing up. $2,000 a night. Want a super room not overlooking your john it\u2019s $4,000 a night. The Ritz\u2019s prices now look like a Hamptons timeshare. Hotel rooms in Europe \u2014 $1,000 to $1,400 a night.\nThree-day stay is norm but they throw in breakfast. Itchy for the Amalfi Coast? It\u2019s $5,000 a night. Rome, heating up faster than Hell\u2019s Kitchen, has hit 120 degrees. Perspired travelers are pushing north. Shoving now to Switzerland, Bavaria, cooler Scandinavia.\nAlso they\u2019re discovering Japan. It\u2019s cheaper. Safe. Clean. Efficient. Nice. But such a long schlep that visiting the moon is shorter. And pay attention \u2014 nobody, nobody \u2014 is lining up for China.\nIf Mao had great grandchildren even they wouldn\u2019t buy a rice cake in downtown Shanghai. However, the once greatest shopping city on the planet \u2014 Hong Kong \u2014 is still a major destination.\nThey\u2019re shipshape\nThe big transport? Ships.\nOnce, bus tours. Now cruises. Ships that squeeze in 6,000 passengers, 47 restaurants, bowling alleys, skating rinks, swimming pools, movies, lectures, shows, wall-climbing try to make you believe you\u2019re on a private yacht. All great \u2014 until some steward loses your drawers in the laundry.\nListen, I wish you well. Have a nice time. Betty Grable, Hollywood\u2019s famous long ago beauty queen, once told me: \u201cAll I want in life is to take a five-day ocean sail to England and have a different guy make love to me every night.\u201d\nOK by me. Definitely beats a Remsenburg time share."

      "text": "Help FDNY keep us safe\nRobert Tucker, FDNY commissioner, told me what should be in every home.\n\u201cFirst, a working smoke alarm. Many have them but the battery\u2019s not operative. Crazy \u2014 because we give them out for free. We even come to your home and install them for free. Also, go to FDNYsmart.org. We give safety tips for free. A working smoke alarm might also have a CO2 detector. It\u2019s bare minimum at this point.\n\u201cCentral for the fire department for anywhere on the island of Manhattan is a place you\u2019ve passed 100 times without knowing what you\u2019ve passed. Everything goes right there. And everyone\u2019s passed it 100 times without knowing it. It\u2019s on the 79th Street transverse and nobody knows what they were passing.\u201d\nOK, so who are you? How did you get to be fire commissioner?\n\u201cLiving nearby and with my bike, I\u2019d hang around 85th between Lex and Third near the firehouse. Doors open. A fire buff, I became a summer intern in a small office helping to dispatch the engines. Born in New York City. Went to Fieldston. Had my law degree and knew I wanted to be a fireman. A police and fire buff, I\u2019d chase fire engines with a little scanner on my bike up and down Lexington and Park avenues.\n\u201cI did a project mapping Manhattan\u2019s multiple-alarm fires. Fifth alarm were pins with white heads, fourth \u2014 red heads, third \u2014 green heads.\n\u201cLet homeowners know, in a fireproof apartment building, unless otherwise instructed, shelter in place. Shut doors. If doors are shut, fire can be contained. We even handle outdoor fires, car fires. We are New York City\u2019s rescuers.\n\u201cListen, I\u2019ve been scared. Like at 345 Park Ave. So was the mayor and Commissioner Tisch. We were outside, scared for our EMTs, paramedics, firefighters. A staff travels with me. A special cell, state-of-the-art, rings in a certain way if something happens. At one Saturday night dinner party it rang when a boat hit the Brooklyn Bridge and people were in the water. Other guests said, \u2018What\u2019s a fire commissioner?\u2019\n\u201cThey laughed thinking here\u2019s more food for them \u2014 and next it\u2019s the top story around the world.\u201d\nSay again what should all residents have?\n\u201cSeveral working smoke detectors, CO2 detectors and fire extinguishers.\u201d\nDrop the mike\nMe, a question.\nEach politician\u2019s mouth is larger than any of their other parts. Stick love affairs. Shove romance. \u201cGetting it on\u201d is getting it onto a microphone. In office, out of office, scratching for office, none spied a mike they couldn\u2019t avoid.\nForget sex shops, shove cannabis stores. A working MICROPHONE is the only instrument pols want.\nThey hold it, grab it, cuddle it, warm it, stroke it, lick it, kiss it.\nRarely pro speakers, they don\u2019t know how to handle it. A notebook\u2019s in front. On their lectern. OPEN. To the page from which they\u2019re bleating. Eyes straight down after two sentences. Supposedly they\u2019re getting the juice. HOW? They don\u2019t even KNOW it.\nThey\u2019re reading someone\u2019s pre-written information.\nFEELING unsure and seeing protests, marches, hatreds, my friends moving and prices rising, I had a big talk with my Wall Street broker yesterday. I now feel better about any future possibility of an unsafe market. We set up a calculated all-encompassing program designed to reach certain investment goals during the next five years. Like getting even.\nOy, like Only in New York, kids, only in New York."
