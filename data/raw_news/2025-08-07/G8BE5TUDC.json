  "title": "Toyota slashes outlook on tariff concerns as profit plunges 37%",
  "description": "Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s April-June profit totaled 841 billion yen ($5.7 billion), down from 1.33 trillion yen in the same period of 2024.",
  "content": "Toyota\u2019s profit plunged 37% in the April-June quarter, the company said Thursday, cutting its full year earnings forecasts largely because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nThe Japanese automaker said it based its report on the assumption that Trump\u2019s tariffs on exports from Japan, including autos, would be 12.5% starting this month. As of now they stand at 15%.\n\nThe world\u2019s top automaker also makes vehicles in Mexico and Canada. Toyota\u2019s profit in the last quarter totaled 841 billion yen, or $5.7 billion, down from 1.33 trillion yen in the same period the year before. Its quarterly sales rose 3%.\n\nThe status of those exports is unclear since Mexico and Canada are beneficiaries of the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement, renegotiated from a 1990s pact during Trump\u2019s first term in office, that eliminated most tariffs and trade barriers between the three countries.\n\nToyota Motor Corp.\u2019s April-June profit totaled 841 billion yen ($5.7 billion), down from 1.33 trillion yen in the same period of 2024. Quarterly sales rose 3% to 12 trillion yen ($82 billion).\n\nToyota said the tariffs cost its quarterly operating profit 450 billion yen ($3 billion). Cost reduction efforts and the negative impact of an unfavorable exchange rate also hurt its bottom line.\n\nThe company, which makes the Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models, forecast a 2.66 trillion yen ($18 billion) profit for the full fiscal year ending in March 2026, down from an earlier forecast for a 3.1 trillion yen ($21 billion) profit. Toyota earned nearly 4.8 trillion yen in the previous fiscal year.\n\n\u201cDespite a challenging external environment, we have continued to make comprehensive investments, as well as improvements such as increased unit sales, cost reductions and expanded value chain profits,\u201d Toyota said in a statement that outlined its efforts to minimize the impact of the tariffs.\n\nAt the retail level, Toyota sold 2.4 million vehicles globally, with sales growing in Japan, North America and Europe from the previous year, when global retail totaled 2.2 million vehicles.\n\nAnalysts say Toyota is likely among the worst hit by the tariffs among global companies, even compared with other Japanese automakers.\n\nAlso Thursday, Toyota announced it was building a new car assembly plant in Japan that it expects to have up and running in the early 2030s. It is acquiring a site in Toyota city, Aichi Prefecture, central Japan, where the automaker is headquartered.\n\nThe models to be produced there are still undecided, but the plant will be part of the company\u2019s plan to maintain a production capacity of 3 million vehicles in Japan, according to Toyota. Billed as \u201ca plant of the future,\u201d it will also feature new technology tailored for what Toyota said will be a diverse work force.",
