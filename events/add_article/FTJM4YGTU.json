      "summary": "Fed Chair Jerome Powell faces a dilemma as Trump tariffs threaten to raise consumer prices while the labor market shows signs of cooling, forcing the Fed to balance its dual mandate of containing inflation and supporting employment. Raising rates could curb inflation but risk a financial panic and further job losses; cutting rates could spur hiring but may fuel unanchored inflation expectations. Economists compare the current situation to the 1930s Smoot‑Hawley era, noting that tariff‑driven price spikes may behave like an oil shock, yet the recent post‑pandemic inflation memory heightens the risk of a prolonged inflationary spiral.",
