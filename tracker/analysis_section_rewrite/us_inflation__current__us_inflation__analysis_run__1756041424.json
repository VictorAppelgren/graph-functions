      "feedback": "Your draft has a solid base but needs a tighter, data‑driven 0–3 week framing with explicit catalysts, a clean causal chain, and a concise monitor/invalidations plan. Edit it to (1) one clear 0–3 week playbook: immediate drivers (tariff policy state, notably the 27.5%→15% shift; Nikkei’s report of pass‑through; ongoing US production investment) and near‑term catalysts (upcoming guidance from Toyota/Ford, any further tariff moves); (2) a precise causal map tying policy to prices, margins, and inflation signals: tariff cost pressure → whether autos pass costs to US buyers (as Nikkei suggests) or absorb factors; regional profitability divergence (Toyota NA −$438m vs $5.8b total quarterly profit; Ford tariff cost >$2b) → pricing/margin dynamics and capex shifts toward US production (Toyota US output 1.96m units in 12‑month window; GM invest ~$4b to reach 2m US annual output) (all anchored to S15934PBQ); (3) quantify finance/credit channel using first principles and S7M6BJSRT: rate sensitivity by loan term and credit score, fixed vs variable, origination/prepayment fees; illustrate how autos’ higher prices and tighter credit conditions could slow discretionary auto demand in the 0–3 week window; (4) sharpen the base/upgrade/downside/invalidation framework with concrete thresholds: e.g., tariff at 15% persists without price relief vs a policy reversal; observable price increases in autos vs seasonal factors; (5) add a tight monitoring checklist: tariff policy updates; automaker pricing commentary and capex guidance; near‑term auto loan rate movements and credit tightening signals; auto equity/credit market reaction; and any revisions to US/Japan trade data; (6) align content to SECTION FOCUS by explicitly naming “Key levels/thresholds” (tariff level, price pass‑through indication, and loan‑rate signals), “invalidation” (policy reversal or price relief materializing faster than expected), and “watch next” (tariff news cadence, earnings commentary, and short‑end rate moves). Swap generic phrasing for precise anchors drawn from S15934PBQ and S7M6BJSRT: highlight 15% tariff level, 1.96m Toyota U.S. builds, 794k NA auto sales, −$438m NA operating income, Ford’s >$2b tariff cost, 4.4b Japan/5.8b total quarterly profit spread, and loan‑rate dynamics (6–84 month terms, 6.49%–35.49% APR ranges, origination fees) (cite S15934PBQ; S7M6BJSRT). (7) tighten the prose to remove hedges and present a clean, cause‑and‑effect chain with explicit numbers rather than qualitative statements; (8) ensure every assertion about tariffs, prices, and financing has a direct anchor to the specified IDs. This will produce a world‑class h0–3w framing: immediate drivers, near‑term catalysts, and a defined reaction function with testable thresholds. Citations should read as (S15934PBQ)(S7M6BJSRT) only.",
