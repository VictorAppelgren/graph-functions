  "title": "Spooky Stardew Valley vibes put this \"nightmarish life sim RPG\" co-directed by Celeste's artist on my radar, and I can't wait until it launches next year to start my new rural life on a twisted farm",
  "description": "Neverway releases in 2026",
  "content": "Now that work on Stardew Valley is set to slow down as developer ConcernedApe looks to his other upcoming game, Haunted Chocolatier, I've got my eyes set elsewhere \u2013 on one very spooktacular life sim, to be precise.\n\nNeverway is a stunning new pixel-style \"nightmarish life sim RPG,\" according to developer Coldblood Inc. With talented indie veterans heading its production, including Celeste artist Pedro Medeiros, it's hard not to fall in love with the game at first sight \u2013 especially after its recent trailer during Nintendo's Indie World Showcase. Not only does it highlight some of what sets Neverway apart from other genre gems, but it provides a release window, too.\n\n\n\nNeverway is set to launch in 2026, which could leave mere months between now and when it arrives \u2013 good news for fellow fans of games like Stardew Valley. It ticks all the essential life-sim and cozy-RPG boxes, with crafting, combat, cooking, farming, fishing, friend-making (and yes, romance), and more, but strays from the norm with its twisted underlying story. Not only do you start a rural life on a farm\u2026 You become the immortal herald of a dead god.\n\nAs Coldblood Inc. describes on the game's official Steam page, you're to \"make friends, fight through horrors, and pay your debt\" in Neverway \u2013 and you must \"remember to pay your debt at all costs\u2026\" Sounds a bit ominous, right? The trailer does showcase some of what awaits, from crawling ghouls to floating skulls, so it's safe to say you'll definitely want to heed the developers' warning and pay off your debt before facing a fearsome fate.\n\nAs a longtime fan of all things life sim and RPG myself, I personally can't wait to hop into Neverway and rule as the herald of a lost god\u2026 and also farm, of course. For any Stardew stans or horror lovers like me, the game is available to wishlist now on Steam and will launch on both PC as well as the Nintendo Switch when it arrives sometime next year. Here's hoping the Neverway release comes sooner rather than later in 2026.\n\n\n\nExcited for more? Here are some of our other most hotly anticipated new games coming this year and beyond to look forward to.",

      "text": "Stardew Valley guide to everything there is to know about life on the farm\nOur complete Stardew Valley guide will walk you through the essentials\nA Stardew Valley guide is essential for tackling the many layers of a farming simulator. It\u2019s hard to keep track of everything, and fortunately with this guide, you won't have to. How you decide to play is up to you and we've got tips and tricks for every scenario. You can tend to your crops, build relationships, make a ton of money, or just kick back, relax, and amble around the cute scenery.\nSo, whether you\u2019re a veteran looking to elevate your gameplay even further, or a newbie overwhelmed by the amount of activities on offer in Stardew Valley, this ultimate guide will point you in the right direction. We\u2019ve laid out all the top tips, info, and even cheats, as well as how to find some rare items to really maximize your gameplay. After all, you wouldn\u2019t want to miss out on all the potential Stardew Valley has to offer.\nStardew Valley tips\nOur Stardew Valley tips reveal all there is to know about making money quickly, investing in crops, fishing, mining, which sections of town to unlock first, and more. They're an essential read for anyone jumping into the game for the first time. The most crucial time is your Stardew Valley Year One, and luckily we've got a guide on how best to tackle that momentous time in your game journey and plan the future for your farm.\nStardew Valley cheats and mods\nBy following our Stardew Valley cheats and Stardew Valley mods guides, you'll open up a world of opportunity within the game. We're talking infinite money, easier fishing, staying up past the 2am curfew, a chest labeling system, and even rideable bears. While it's meant to be a relaxing game, sometimes Stardew Valley can become quite stressful as you juggle the many tasks at hand. So, you can ease the workload with these helpful cheats and mods. Don't worry, we won't tell on you.\nStardew Valley co-op\nLearning how to use Stardew Valley co-op and multiplayer will not only make farming a hell of a lot easier, but it's just a lot of fun. It's a fan-favorite feature for good reason as friends can join you on a local, online, or split-screen to really up the enjoyment factor of the game. Or, enjoy every aspect of Stardew Valley in your alone time. It's totally up to you, but looking into co-op will at least have you prepared if you do want to play with friends.\nStardew Valley fish\nWhen it comes to Stardew Valley fish, there's a lot to catch. But, catching them isn't as simple as casting your fishing rod nonchalantly into the sea. There's a huge variety of fish to catch and numerous factors in play as to whether you'll achieve it or not. Luckily, our guide will take you through how to catch all the different types of fish, teach you about the different rods, and even explain the best way to catch unique legendary fish.\nStardew Valley gifts\nHanding out Stardew Valley gifts is a wonderful way to form friendships, and maybe even love, in the game. But, it requires a certain finesse, especially considering there's 12 eligible bachelor and bachelorette NPCs available to marry. You'll want to forge solid relationships with the Stardew Valley villagers, and the best way to do that is through gift giving. The only real issue is, they all tend like different things (aside from a list of Universal Likes and Loves). In our guide, we've got all the intel on how to give out the best gifts and win over the hearts of the villagers.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nStardew Valley mastery system\nThe Stardew Valley Mastery system was introduced in the 1.6 update, giving players the chance to unlock a whole lot more after reaching level 10 in the five main core skills; Farming, Mining, Fishing, Foraging, and Combat. It can be a little complicated to get your head round, especially since you've first got to find the Mastery Cave, but our guide will help you on your way. It's most certainly worth your time for the additional perks and tools you'll earn.\nStardew Valley rare finds\nThere's a bunch of rare items to find including Stardew Valley Prismatic Shards, Stardew Valley Golden Walnuts, Stardew Valley trinkets, and Stardew Valley sea jelly. As you can see though, we've got you covered with guides delving deep into how you find these relics and special items across the map. It's not going to be easy, but with our guides it'll definitely be achievable.\nStardew Valley special events\nThe 1.6 update bought some new special events that occur in the game, such as the Stardew Valley green rain. While our guide will reveal more, if you're on the hunt for Stardew Valley moss, you'll definitely want to learn about this mysterious weather. There's also opportunity each day to wake up to something else a little unusual and that's the Stardew Valley mystery boxes. They'll drop at random, but there's plenty more to know than that. Finally, the Stardew Valley bookseller pays a visit every so often. Luckily, it's a calendar date and he's got a lot to offer.\n\u00a9 GamesRadar+. Not to be reproduced without permission\nGive me a game and I will write every \"how to\" I possibly can or die trying. When I'm not knee-deep in a game to write guides on, you'll find me hurtling round the track in F1, flinging balls on my phone in Pokemon Go, pretending to know what I'm doing in Football Manager, or clicking on heads in Valorant.\n- Grace DeanFreelance Writer"

      "text": "This Stardew Valley-ish farming sim looks super cozy until you find out about the supernatural serial killer (who you can also romance)\nAnd, trust me, I will be romancing them\nMy most anticipated farming sim, Grave Seasons, has a new trailer and release window.\nGrave Seasons has been on my radar for a while, and it's all down to the game's irresistible set up. It's essentially a farm-n-life sim in the vein of Stardew Valley that looks super wholesome and cozy, except for the fact that there's a supernatural serial killer on the loose who can kill all the NPC villagers you might hope to romance. Or maybe you want to romance the killer, which you can (and I will.)\nHorror movie studio turned horror game publisher Blumhouse released a new trailer for the dark murder mystery earlier this week alongside a 2026 release window for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe juicy trailer down below has just the right amount of jolly crop-growing, NPC chitchatting, and bloody murder to get me really excited.\nGrave Seasons' Steam page shares a few more clues, too. \"After a treacherous escape from jail, you've made it to your new home in Ashenridge, an idyllic town with some seriously unsettling vibes.\" That's when the murders start happening, meaning you'll need to stop them before everyone starts suspecting the new ex-convict in town.\nThe farming stuff isn't just tacked on, either. When you've deduced who the next victim might be, you can craft specific items to save them and ward off the supernatural killer. I imagine by the end of the game mine and your towns might look drastically different depending on who lived or died. It's a really exciting twist on the genre, I think.\nGamesRadar's Ashley Bardhan had very good things to say about the game's berry-picking gameplay and, err, visceral viscera depiction in our Grave Season hands-on impressions.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nHere are some other upcoming indie games of 2025 and beyond to keep you occupied until then.\nKaan freelances for various websites including Rock Paper Shotgun, Eurogamer, and this one, Gamesradar. He particularly enjoys writing about spooky indies, throwback RPGs, and anything that's vaguely silly. Also has an English Literature and Film Studies degree that he'll soon forget.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "10 games like Stardew Valley that'll keep you working on the farm until the cows come home\nThere are plenty of games like Stardew Valley if you're craving an immersive farming sim-meets-RPG experience\nThe best games like Stardew Valley tap into the delightful ingredients that made ConcernedApe's beloved pixelated adventure so memorable and rewarding. Since Stardew Valley first launched back in 2016, its gone on to influence a lot of wonderful games, and there's no shortage of great alternatives out there to explore that deliver their own unique take on the farming experience.\nFrom growing crops, to crafting and exploring, and getting to know the locales, there's all manner of great games like Stardew Valley out there that will likely appeal to you. And as one of the best farming games around, there's plenty of options to consider if you want to tend to crops and care for animals. It's also well worth checking out our pick of games like Harvest Moon.\nStardew Valley creator Eric Barone is also working a new game, Haunted Chocolatier, but it'll likely be some time before we see it arrive, so our list is here to help if you're after some similar games you dive into right now.\nBelow, you'll find our pick of the 10 best games like Stardew Valley around right now.\nThis collection of the best games like Stardew Valley was updated on March 7, 2025 to ensure it includes the best options available right now.\nThe best games like Stardew Valley...\n10. Moonlighter\nDeveloper: Digital Sun\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch\nMoonlighter should tick all your Stardew Valley boxes. By day, it\u2019s a management game where you work as a shopkeeper, bartering with customers and restocking shelves with that kind of wonderful, brain-soothing, mediocrity. But, by night you\u2019re a warrior, diving into roguelike dungeons to scavenge wares for your shop.\nOh, and did we mention the overarching story is incredible? It\u2019s all full of destiny and anguish and a bit of family drama. It absolutely nails that wonderful, self-perpetuating, gameplay loop of busywork that Stardew Valley excels at, with a little touch of Binding of Isaac and even some tongue-in-cheek Dark Souls references. Prepare yourself for a new addiction.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nFor more information, read our Moonlighter review!\n9. Sun Haven\nDeveloper: Pixel Sprout Studios\nPlatform(s): PC\nHave you ever thought to yourself, \u201cI know what Stardew Valley is missing. Dragons, magic, and fantasy\u201d? Sure you have. Well, in this lovely farming sim from Pixel Sprout Studios and backed to almost double its goal on Kickstarter, you\u2019ll get just that. Sun Haven is like Stardew Valley if it was set in medieval times and had a bit of that mythical world injected into it. Plus, you don\u2019t have to be human.\nThere\u2019s a choice of human, demon, elf, angel, elemental, naga, and amari (which basically means you can play as an animal. Want to be a cat? Sure, you can do that.) You\u2019ve got a choice of playing alone or with up to eight people in online co-op. If magic\u2019s your game, this is too.\nIt got a massive update in July 2024, so now's the best time to check it out.\n8. Roots of Pacha\nDeveloper: Soda Den\nPlatform(s): PC, Nintendo Switch, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, XSX\nRoots of Pacha shares a lot of similarities with Stardew Valley, however, the big twist is that it\u2019s set during the Stone Age. Just like in Stardew, here you can fish, farm, help the community, tame animals, and even get married. However, all the mechanics are tied to the game\u2019s time period, making it truly stand out in the cozy and farming sim genre.\nWhether its taming mammoths, solving the puzzles in the mines, or unlocking new technology as you contribute to the tribe\u2019s progression, Roots of Pacha is a fresh take on the genre while offering us that classic Stardew formula. It's truly everything we hoped for and more. Also, on a personal note, we hugely prefer the fishing mini-game in Roots of Pacha to Stardew, stabbing fish with our pointed rocks is way easier and more satisfying, trust us.\nRead our Roots of Patcha Indie Spotlight for more impressions.\n7. Garden Story\nDeveloper: Picogram\nPlatform(s): PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One\nAnother Stardew-style game, Garden Story, made by developer Picogram, is cute and quirky. You take on the role of Concord the grape who teams up with their fruit, fungi, and froggy friends to protect The Grove from the Rot that is threatening to destroy their homes. As Concord, you\u2019ve been appointed the Guardian of The Grove, and whilst still having the usual tasks and changing seasons of Stardew Valley, you\u2019ve also got an overarching storyline of combating the Rot and rebuilding the island. You\u2019ll also build relationships with others that will ultimately help you out too.\nRead more on Garden Story here.\n6. My Time at Portia\nDeveloper: Pathea\nPlatform(s): PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One\nLike Stardew Valley, getting into My Time at Portia can be a bit of a grind to get into. But, the world is so delightful and rewarding to be in, and interact with, that you soon won\u2019t really mind about that. The best way to describe My Time at Portia is to say it\u2019s like crossing The Sims with Stardew, with lashings of Studio Ghibli-esque graphics thrown on top for good measure, like some kind of amazing sundae. This game is as much about becoming part of the Portia community as it is crafting or resource gathering, and that\u2019s part of its charm.\nEveryone just wants to be your BFF, it\u2019s up to you to invite them into your inner circle. Add that quest for all the friends to the continual search for resources to build things for your workshop and the town as a whole, and you\u2019re suddenly very busy indeed. And, oh wait, has the whole weekend gone already?\nTo find out more, check out our My Time at Portia review.\n5. Fields of Mistria\nDeveloper: NPC Studio\nPlatform(s): PC\nCurrently out in Early Access, NPC Studio's delightful farming sim is sure to appeal to Stardew Valley fans everywhere. With dateable residents to get to know and romance if you so wish, a farm to grow and develop to your heart's content, and so much to discover and do, it channels the nostalgia with it's '90s inspired aesthetic. Alongside raising animals, it also offers up features that will no doubt speak to anyone who loves ConcernedApe's pixelated sim - you can also expect to play out quests, learn magic, fish, and mine.\n4. Potion Permit\nDeveloper: MassHive Media\nPlatform(s): PC, Nintendo Switch, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, XSX\nPotion Permit is another charming pixel game like Stardew Valley, though more on the RPG and crafting side of the fence than the farming sim one. In it, you play as a doctor who has just moved to a sleeping town in desperate need of some alchemical magic. You'll spend a lot of your time gathering ingredients to brew potions, whether from wild plants or monsters after vanquishing them in the untamed wilderness that lies just beyond the village walls.\nThen, it's just a matter of combining all the elements in your caldron to create healing elixirs, each with a unique recipe. Potion Permit features elements of management sims, too, as you balance your foraging expeditions with treating patients in the hospital ward, building relationships with the townsfolk, and turning your small surgery into a thriving medical center. Oh, and did I mention there's a romance system?\nYou can read more about Potion Permit here.\n3. Wylde Flowers\nDeveloper: Studio Drydock\nPlatform(s): PC, Nintendo Switch\nHave you ever wanted to be an all-powerful witch tending to her own farm? That's the elevator pitch for this stunning game like Stardew Valley. Wylde Flowers is a peaceful, dreamy cottagecore farming sim underpinned by a curious mystery to unravel. Deep character and narrative-driven elements deliver those RPG sensibilities you might be craving from Stardew Valley, with heroine Tara building relationships with her coven while balancing magic, farm life, and everything in between.\nIt also doubles as one of the best LGBT games for cozy gamers to check out, with diverse romance options available to Tara as she gets to know the townsfolk over the course of her journey. Colorful, narrative, and immediately immersive, Wylde Flowers really has it all.\n2. Slime Rancher\nDeveloper: Monomi Park\nPlatform(s): Xbox One, PC, PS4, Nintendo Switch\nIn Slime Rancher, instead of crops you\u2019re actually harvesting poop - officially known as plorts in-game - from adorable, bouncy, little slimes themed around different animals or objects, from tabby cats to Bulbasaur-like Tangle Slimes. You trade plorts on the Plort Market, with profitable types fluctuating and changing just like a real stock market for poop. You have all your Slimes bouncing around in hutches too, usually sectioned off because they can have a tendency to eat each other, or plorts from another species, which actually creates equally cute hybrids.\nIt\u2019s utterly adorable, until you have to start throwing Tabby Slimes into the Incinerator because their plorts aren\u2019t worth, well, plort anymore. Yes, I know, I\u2019m a terrible, heartless, (rich) monster. It\u2019s not quite Stardew Valley, but it\u2019s that same kind of idle, adorable, fun that you can\u2019t help sinking multiple hundreds of hours into.\nRead our Slime Rancher 2 review to learn more about the sequel currently out in Early Access.\n1. Coral Island\nDeveloper: Stairway Games\nPlatform(s): PC (Early Access)\nCoral Island shares a lot of similarities with Stardew Valley. In fact, we've gone as far as to say that Stairway Games' farming sim, which recently left early access, is even more proof that Stardew Valley is a genre now. In Coral Island, you also leave the city life behind you to begin a new chapter. You're free to build up the farm of your dreams, with crops to grow and animals to tend to. Not unlike Pelican Town, you can also get to know a whole cast of residents and form bonds by giving them gifts. Among the inhabitants are also 25 singles who you can develop a relationship with. With a town to help revive, you can help the community, go diving, hunt for insects, and catch fish, too.\nLooking for more great recommendations that might suit you?

      "text": "There was a predictable lack of Hollow Knight: Silksong at today's Nintendo Indie Direct, but one of the other best Metroidvania devs in the biz announced a new one, and it looks great\nWell Dweller goes right to the top of my wishlist\nIf you were hoping to see Hollow Knight: Silksong at the August 7 Nintendo Indie World showcase, frankly you had the resulting disappointment coming. Here, have a Metroidvania salve for that sting: Well Dweller, a new \"dark fairy-tale Metroidvania\" from a dev who's quickly becoming one of the most accomplished creators of all things Metroid and Vania.\nWell Dweller is the latest game from Kyle Thompson, creator of Islets and Crypt Custodian \u2013 both excellent Metroidvanias of their own. His first Steam release, Sheepo, is also a tiny Metroidvania, but I'm less familiar with it.\nI'd recognize Thompson's signature style from 100 meters, and when Well Dweller first appeared in the Nintendo lineup, I was immediately hoping it would be another Metroidvania. When that map appeared, I shot up in my seat. A Silksong appearance would've been great too, but I'll take another hugely promising Metroidvania almost any day of the week.\nLike Crypt Custodian, Well Dweller has the backing of publisher Top Hat Studios, which you may know from this year's Labyrinth of the Demon King, last year's Ova Magica, or unmissable anime FPS The Citadel. You play as a tiny little bird named Glimmer, wielding a matchstick and wandering a quietly grisly world.\nThe elevator pitch on Steam is pure, distilled Metroidvania-grade search action:\n\"Deep within the forest, at the bottom of a well, lives the only creature brave enough to kill the queen. Play as Glimmer \u2013 a tiny bird armed with a matchstick \u2013 who must burn the wicked queen to save his family. Explore a dark fairy-tale landscape and befriend the charming characters who reside in the kingdom's underbelly. Battle terrifying beasts and gain new abilities to expand your map. Solve puzzles, discover secrets, and unravel the mysteries that lie in this rotted kingdom.\"\nYour matchstick weapon seems to bring a sense of physicality to the world; you can embed it in walls to make a platform, for instance, and then recall. One of the equipable trinkets shown \u2013 using a similar slot and point system seen in many modern Metroidvanias \u2013 expanded the window for \"re-lighting your matchstick,\" which suggests there's some kind of perfect reload-style timing or perhaps follow-up attack for the match.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nMetroidvanias can be a hard and competitive market for indies nowadays, so I wasn't sure if Thompson would immediately make another one even after making the genre work multiple times. But Well Dweller looks like exactly the sort of game I would've hoped for. It's coming to Switch and PC in 2026.\nAustin has been a game journalist for 12 years, having freelanced for the likes of PC Gamer, Eurogamer, IGN, Sports Illustrated, and more while finishing his journalism degree.

      "text": "With Haunted Chocolatier still miles away, farming sim with serial killers Grave Seasons is here to scratch that cozy horror itch until it bleeds\nSummer Preview 2025 | I'd live in this spooky Stardew Valley, despite the risks\nThe Grave Seasons demo I'm playing at Summer Game Fest begins like the first bite of ice cream. It's innocent, but I prepare myself for the moment it becomes obvious why the horror masters at M3GAN studio Blumhouse are publishing a cozy farming sim.\nI decide to get in the mood for tragedy by being as much of a bitch as possible. A supernaturally buff townsperson, Hari, saunters by to welcome me to Ashenridge, a seemingly quaint country town which the previous owner of my little cottage happened to flee without warning. But Grave Seasons' protagonist, like myself as a horror obsessive, seems attracted to fear.\nPerfect Garbage co-founder and Grave Seasons narrative director Emmett Nahil tells me Grave Seasons' particular brand of fright is influenced by folk horror, '50s Hollywood Hammer horror, and \u2013 I could cry when I hear this \u2013 my favorite werewolf movie, Ginger Snaps (2000).\nSo, I vow to ignore the splotch of what looks like dried blood on the edge of the chimney, and when Hari questions why I, obviously not the tomato-planting type, decided to move in, I tell him, \"None of your business.\"\nWhat's my business, for now, is plucking some of the fresh strawberries and bamboo shoots out of my already fertile garden plot and chucking in some carrot seeds instead. I go through the motions, pulling out my watering can, testing out the pickaxe, and finding a strange signet ring in a pile of trash, in a moment that reminds me of horror fishing game Dredge. I walk around sand pathways, tree roots, and make myself a vegetarian snack \u2013 passing time until the moon is high, and I can meet my new friend Pilar in the woods to pick night-blooming herbs.\nNahil prefers Grave Seasons' occult crafting, too, which yields things like \"prevention items, which may help you prevent attacks by the killer,\" he says. \"Any of those [occult] crafting moments are always really fun, because there's a lot of tension behind them.\" Since Grave Seasons features multiple killers and monsters, I predict there aren't any amulets that can guarantee 100% safety.\nPlus, \"one of the really fun things about the game,\" adds Perfect Garbage lead programmer Nikky Armstrong, \"is, when it launches, everybody's getting a different experience, because every time you start a new game, it's randomly selected who the killer is going to be.\"\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nIn these words, I sense unrelenting danger. This makes me more eager, and, without me asking explicitly, Nahil informs me that \"you may potentially be able to romance the killer.\" As I'm still nursing my celebrity crush on Katharine Isabelle, Ginger Snaps' mean girl werewolf, I'm comforted by this.\nSo I keep waiting for the sun to set. Eventually, blue daylight gives way to Halloween orange, and then dusk finally falls and turns Ashenridge black. Then, I notice the world has started sounding different \u2013 angrier.\n\"As you play through the full game,\" Nahil says, \"[the sound design] will change as the town itself changes, which is really cool.\"\n\"Not only through the seasons,\" he explains, \"but through specific romance arcs, or through specific instances of how many kills have occurred. How dark is the town by the end of the game \u2013 those things will change the sound.\"\nI don't let it deter me. Just as I did in the comparable pixel art, horror life sim Little Goody Two Shoes, I allow myself to be led into the witch's woods. When I get there, I see Pilar fending off absolute darkness with her soft-glowing lantern, and then I see her succumbing to a werewolf who's snuck up behind her. It takes her in its mouth and crushes her body like flower petals.\nHer blood and parts are strewn all over the grass, and my heart twitches, but I'd be lying if I said this wasn't the kind of moment I live for in games. Sometimes I think art doesn't feel visceral to me unless I can see actual viscera. These moments of fragility force me to confront my own, and it's meditative. That's why the horror genre is one of the only things I can rely on to make me feel better about the actual threatening, unkind world, every time.\nOn that note, Nahil says fans who are considering playing Grave Seasons should know that \"if you are a cozy gamer, and if you love farming sims, we are really hoping that you'll let us take you someplace a little bit different,\" says Nahil. \"If you are a horror gamer, let us take you someplace maybe a little bit cozier.\"\n\"Our goal is to match genres and bridge that gap between those players,\" he continues, \"because we really believe, as a studio, that they're maybe not so different after all.\"\nGrave Seasons is now available to wishlist on Steam, and it'll also eventually arrive on all major consoles, including Switch 2.\nAshley is a Senior Writer at GamesRadar+.

      "text": "Haunted Chocolatier: Everything we know about the Stardew Valley creator's next game\n2D pixel adventure Haunted Chocolatier is still at large in 2025, but there's plenty to sate your sweet tooth here in the meantime\nHaunted Chocolatier is the name of the new adventure coming our way from Stardew Valley creator, Eric Barone, aka ConcernedApe. Officially revealed a few years ago back in 2021, we've steadily been learning more about the sweet new life sim that will see us take on the role of chocolatier in a haunted castle. With details from Barone that shed light on some of its features, to exciting screenshots, it's shaping up to be one of the most exciting new games headed our way.\nAlongside lots of chocolate making goodness and some mysterious vibes, it looks like we're going to be in for a treat. In a recent interview, Barone also spoke at length about the upcoming adventure and said he's been exploring the option to bring in chocolate alternatives, alongside setting a limit on many chocolates we can eat each day as we run our own shop. While it's set to have more of an action combat focus, the developer has also emphasized that it will still have lots of ingredients that will speak to fans of the farming sim.\nIt's certainly exciting time for fans of games like Stardew Valley, with the magical Witchbrook set to come from Chucklefish sometime this year ahead of ConcernedApe's new game. But if you can hardly wait for it to arrive, join us as we recap everything we know so far about Haunted Chocolatier.\nThis hub of everything we know so far about Haunted Chocolatier was updated on May 16, 2025, ensuring all the latest news and info is included.\nHaunted Chocolatier release date speculation\nCurrently, there's no Haunted Chocolatier release date, and it's unlikely that we'll see the game anytime soon.\nIn an FAQ posted back in 2021, Barone stated, \"I can't commit to a release date yet\" as it's still \"relatively early in development.\"\n\"I want to be able to work in peace without the pressure of a release date, or even an estimated release date,\" the post continues.\nIn a later update, Barone added: \"The bottom line, is that I won't rest, or release this game, until I am personally satisfied that it's very fun and compelling, in every aspect. If it never gets there, I'll never release it. But don't worry, I have 100% faith that I'll get it there.\"\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nIn 2025, during an appearance on Bobby Lee's TigerBelly podcast, Barone also said he can't say if Haunted Chocolatier will be out by 2030, but that's \"the goal\", adding that \"there's still lots to be done\".\nHaunted Chocolatier development\nThere is going to be a Stardew 1.6 update. It's mostly changes for modders (which will make it easier & more powerful to mod). But there is also new game content, albeit much less than 1.5. I'm taking a break from Haunted Chocolatier to work on this at the moment. Then back to HCApril 16, 2023\nHaunted Chocolatier is indeed the next game from Stardew Valley developer Eric Barone. Also known as ConcernedApe, the dev had been busy working to bring us the sizable Stardew Valley 1.6 update, which is now available on consoles as well as PC.\nWhile Barone took a break from Haunted Chocolatier to focus on the update for some time, he revealed that he's done \"a ton of work\" on the upcoming game in another blog post.\nBut even if more progress has been made on the project, Barone reiterates in the blog that it won't be ready for some time, and just like Stardew Valley, it won't be releasing in Early Access, be crowdfunded, or have pre-orders, \"so I don't feel a ton of external pressure to finish the game on a timeline\".\nHaunted Chocolatier gameplay\nThe gameplay trailer above, which was released alongside the announcement back in 2021, serves up a vertical slice of how the game is currently shaping up in its early stages. With a look at some of the combat, interactions, town setting, locales, and even some ghosts sporting shades, there's plenty to see that has us excited.\nIn the first \"hello world\" blog post, Barone offers some insight into the kind of game Haunted Chocolatier will be, detailing some of the aims for the game and how it compares to Stardew Valley. While it's \"developing organically\" and may go in different directions, the post touches on the core gameplay loop, which involves \"gathering ingredients, making chocolate, and running a chocolate shop.\"\nThere is, of course, more to it than that, but Barone emphasizes that he doesn't want to be tied to any particular concept and expressed a desire to \"explore more fantastical possibilities\" and \"experiences that take you beyond the ordinary\" compared to the humble play of Stardew Valley.\n\"Chocolate represents that which is delightful,\" the post continues. \"The haunted castle represents the allure of the unknown. The ghosts represent the imprint of the past. All of these things are important.\"\n\"However, don't think for a moment that, because this game features ghosts in a haunted castle, it is an evil or negative game,\" Barone adds. \"On the contrary, I intend for this game to be positive, uplifting, and life-affirming. However, if Stardew Valley mostly channeled the energy of the sun, Haunted Chocolatier channels the energy of the moon. Both are vital.\"\nIn a blog post titled \"Intuitive Chocolate making\", Barone also revealed that there will be more than way to make chocolate in the adventure as we run our shop:\n\"There will be a more \"intuitive\" way, but there are also more conventional ways to do it [make chocolate],\" Barone writes. \"There will be reasons to use both, but you could just focus on one or the other if you wanted to. At their core, they are all processes in which you convert ingredients into final products. It's just that one process might be more 'whimsical' and another process might be more mechanical\".\nBarone also revealed in June 2025 that the world of Haunted Chocolatier is \"larger than Stardew Valley\", so it sounds as if we'll have a more expansive place to explore than that of Pelican Town in the farming sim.\nHaunted Chocolatier is closer to an action-RPG\nThe FAQ also describes Haunted Chocolatier as another \"town game\" like Stardew Valley, where you move to a new town and try out a new way of living. Not unlike the residents of Pelican Town, you'll be able to get to know the townspeople, be able to develop relationships with NPCs in Haunted Chocolatier and \"make progress in many ways\".\nBut the new adventure is closer to an action-RPG in comparison to Stardew Valley (aka one of the best farming games ever made), and it will be a single-player experience.\nWhile it's more of an action RPG in comparison to the farming sim, Barone said in an interview with PC Gamer that Haunted Chocolatier is still very much a life sim, and is similar to Stardew Valley in many ways, but it has more \"dark and mysterious\" vibes.\nCurrently there is no word on any multiplayer features for Haunted Chocolatier, but we'll let you know as soon as we hear any news.\nHaunted Chocolatier has a \"greater focus on combat\"\nA later blog post update offered us more insight into the combat of Haunted Chocolatier, which is a bigger part of the experience in comparison to Stardew Valley. As we've seen so far in the early gameplay footage and some screenshots, there will be different weapons we can use, including shields that will allow us to deflect hits as we take on various foes in the world. As the blog details, many attacks can be blocked, and doing so will cause an enemy to become stunned and allow for quick attacks.\n\"The shield/stun mechanic rewards more cautious, patient players who wait for a window of opportunity,\" Barone writes. \"But you don't have to play like this, you could just as well charge in aggressively, and if you can pull it off, you\u2019ll defeat enemies more quickly that way. There will be other off-hand items besides shields that will compliment different play styles.\"\nOf course, everything that's been shown so far is a work-in-progress, so it may change over the course of the game's development, but it's exciting to see the kind of direction combat is going in so far. Interestingly, a tweet also gave us a look at a screenshot of a big bee foe, which suggests we may be taking on boss battles. You can even listen to the music of the \"boss bee\" here.\nHaunted Chocolatier platforms\nIn terms of what platforms Haunted Chocolatier is expected to release on, the FAQ confirms that PC is the only certainty, but there's \"every intention\" of bringing it to other major platforms as well.\nIf it follows in the footsteps of Stardew Valley we should see the game head to Xbox Series X, PS5, and Nintendo Switch in the future, too (and perhaps the Switch 2 given that Nintendo's new console is set to launch in 2025). We may also see a mobile release. We'll keep you posted as more platform news gets announced.\nHaunted Chocolatier news\n- Eric Barone is \"committed to not working on Stardew Valley until I'm done with Haunted Chocolatier,\" but he'll \"never say\" he's completely done with his magnum opus\n- Eric Barone says \"I have not touched Haunted Chocolatier in a long time\" because he's still working on getting Stardew Valley 1.6 to console\n- As Stardew Valley fans enjoy update 1.6, Haunted Chocolatier hopefuls hold onto a scrap of info from Eric Barone: \"I had this in mind from the beginning\"\n- Stardew Valley's Eric Barone is \"eager\" to get back to working on Haunted Chocolatier but wants 1.6 \"bug-free and out to all platforms\" first\n- If you liked Stardew Valley's bedridden grandpa, you'll love this Haunted Chocolatier screenshot\n- Stardew Valley dev shares bite-sized glimpse of next game Haunted Chocolatier\n- Stardew Valley dev explains what you actually do in Haunted Chocolatier, and how Diablo 2 influenced it\nIf you're after more life sims, check out our list of the best simulator games to play right now.
