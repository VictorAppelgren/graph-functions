      "text": "Taylor Swift buys back her master recordings\n- Published\nTaylor Swift has bought back the rights to her first six albums, ending a long-running battle over the ownership of her music.\n\"All of the music I've ever made now belongs to me,\" said the star, announcing the news on her official website., external \"I've been bursting into tears of joy... ever since I found out this is really happening.\"\nThe saga began in June 2019, when music manager Scooter Braun bought Swift's former record label Big Machine and, with it, all of the songs from Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989 and Reputation.\nSwift had personal objections to the deal, blaming Braun for complicity in the \"incessant, manipulative bullying\" against her by Kanye West, one of his clients.\nOn her website, Swift said that reclaiming the rights to her music had, for a long time, seemed unimaginable.\n\"To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it,\" she added, thanking fans for their support as the drama played out.\n\"I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now.\n\"I almost stopped thinking it could ever happen, after 20 years of having the carrot dangled and then yanked away,\" she wrote.\n\"But that's all in the past now.\"\nIn the music industry, the owner of a master recording controls the way it is distributed and licenced. The artist still earns royalties, but controlling the masters offers protection over how the work is used in future.\nReputation (Taylor's Version) delayed?\nSwift responded to the original sale of her masters by vowing to re-record those records, effectively diminishing the value of those master tapes, and putting ownership back in her hands.\nTo date, she has released four re-recorded albums - known as \"Taylor's Versions\" - with dozens of bonus tracks and supplementary material.\nIn her letter, the star told fans she had yet to complete the project, after \"hitting a stopping point\" while trying to remake 2017's Reputation album - which dealt with public scrutiny of her private life, and the fall-out of her feud with Kanye West.\n\"The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life,\" she explained. \"All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposefully misunderstood...\n\"To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in those first six that I thought couldn't be improved by re-doing it... so I kept putting it off.\"\nLast week, the star previewed the new version of Reputation's first single, Look What You Made Me Do, in an episode of The Handmaid's Tale - but her letter suggested that a full re-recording would be delayed or even scrapped.\nHowever, she promised that vault tracks from the record would be released at a future date, if fans were \"into the idea\".\nShe also confirmed that she had re-recorded her self-titled debut, adding: \"I really love how it sounds now\".\n\"Those two albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right,\" she added.\n\"But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now.\"\nWhat is a master recording?\nAs the name suggests, a master recording is the original recorded performance of a song. Whoever owns it controls all the rights to exploit the music.\nThat includes distributing it to streaming services, pressing new physical CDs and vinyl, creating box sets, or licensing songs to movies or video games.\nSwift, as the writer or co-writer of her music, always maintained her publishing rights, which meant she was able to veto attempts to license songs like Shake It Off and Love Story to other companies.\n\"I do want my music to live on. I do want it to be in movies. I do want it to be in commercials. But I only want that if I own it,\" she told Billboard in 2019.\nIt is not known how much it cost Swift to acquire her masters, but the catalogue previously sold for $300m (\u00a3222m) in 2020.\nThe BBC understands that rumours she paid between $600m to $1bn are inaccurately high.\nHow did the sale of Taylor Swift's masters happen?\nWhen 14-year-old Taylor Swift moved to Nashville in 2004 to chase her dream of becoming a country pop star, she signed a record deal with Big Machine.\nLabel boss Scott Borchetta gave the unproven singer a big cash advance in exchange for having ownership of the master recordings to her first six albums \"in perpetuity\".\nThis was fairly common practice in the era before streaming, when artists needed record label backing to get played on the radio, and for the manufacture and distribution of CDs.\nSwift's deal with Big Machine expired in 2018, at which point she left and signed with Republic Records and Universal Music Group (UMG).\nA year later, Borchetta sold his label to Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings.\nSwift said she only learned about the deal when it was announced; characterising it as an act of aggression that \"stripped me of my life's work\".\nShe labelled Braun - who rose to prominence as the manager of Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande - as \"the definition of toxic male privilege in our industry\".\nShe also expressed frustration that she had been unable to make a counter offer for her music.\n\"I spent 10 years of my life trying rigorously to purchase my masters outright and was then denied that opportunity,\" she told Billboard, external, adding that: \"Artists should maybe have the first right of refusal to buy.\"\nBraun later told Variety that the dispute had \"gotten out of hand\" after he and his family received death threats.\nThe music mogul later sold his stake in Swift's back catalogue to Shamrock Holdings, a Los Angeles investment fund founded by the Disney family in 1978, in November 2020.\nThe multi-million dollar deal left Swift feeling betrayed again.\n\"This is the second time my music had been sold without my knowledge,\" she said in a social media post.\nWhile she was \"open to the possibility of a partnership with Shamrock\", she subsequently learnt that, under the terms of the sale, Braun would \"continue to profit off my old music\" for years.\n\"I simply cannot in good conscience bring myself to be involved in benefiting Scooter Braun's interests,\" she wrote in a letter to the company, which she posted on X.\nShe began releasing her re-recorded albums in 2021, starting with her breakthrough, coming-of-age album Fearless.\nProduced with forensic attention to detail, they were often indistinguishable from the originals - albeit with slightly cleaner mixes, and greater separation between the instruments.\nBut the big attraction was the bonus tracks, including the unabridged, 10-minute version of her break-up ballad All Too Well - described by Variety magazine as the \"holy grail\" of the star's back catalogue.\nThe song went on to top the US charts, and made number three in the UK - where it is the longest song ever to reach the top five.\nIn the meantime, the singer continued to release original material, including the Grammy Award-winning albums Folklore and Midnights.\nIn 2023, Forbes magazine reported that Swift had become the first musician to make $1 billion (\u00a3740 million) solely from songwriting and performing.\nHalf of her fortune came from music royalties and touring, while the rest came from the increasing value of her music catalogue, including her re-recordings.\nRevisiting the old material also inspired Swift's career-spanning Eras tour, which made more than $2 billion (\u00a31.48 billion) in ticket sales across 2023 and 2024.\nIn her letter, Swift said the success of the Eras tour \"is why I was able to buy back my music\".\nShe added that she was heartened to see her struggle inspiring other artists.\n\"Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this fight, I'm reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen.\n\"Thank you being curious about something that used to be thought of as too industry-centric for broad discussion.\n\"You'll never know how much it means to me that you cared. Every single bit of it counted, and ended us up here.\"\nRelated topics\n- Published9 December 2024\n- Published27 October 2023\n- Published17 November 2020\n- Published19 April 2024\n- Published12 February 2021\n- Published19 November 2021\n- Published21 August 2024"

      "text": "Why is Taylor Swift so big? 'She wants it more than anyone'\n- Published\nThe most lucrative concert tour in music history lands in the UK on Friday, when Taylor Swift plays the first of three nights at Edinburgh\u2019s Murrayfield Stadium.\nThe star will take to the stage shortly after 19:00 BST, playing to almost 73,000 fans, who\u2019ve come from all over the world to see her career-spanning, three-hour show.\nIt will be the first of 17 UK dates, culminating in a record-breaking eight-night run at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium.\nBy then, she will have played to almost 1.2 million UK fans, with an average ticket price of \u00a3206.\nSwift arrives in Scotland as the biggest musical phenomenon of her era, achieving a cultural weight not seen since the heyday of Madonna and Michael Jackson in the 1980s.\nHer 152-date stadium tour is on pace to make more than $2 billion (\u00a31.5 billion) by the time it wraps up in Canada this December. And that\u2019s not including merchandise sales, or the $261 million (\u00a3204 million) her tour film made at the box office last year.\nLocal economies say they\u2019ve received a \u201cTaylor boost\u201d of tens of millions of pounds when her show rolls into town; and one show in Seattle was said to have generated seismic activity equivalent to a 2.3 magnitude earthquake,\nTo mark her arrival in Scotland, trams have been decorated with her picture, Loch Tay has been rebranded \u201cLoch Tay Tay\u201d, and Edinburgh Zoo has named two newborn, critically endangered tamarin monkeys \u201cTaylor\u201d and \u201cSwift\u201d.\nWith all the excitement, it\u2019s easy to forget that the last time she played in the UK, on 2018\u2019s Reputation tour, stadiums failed to sell out. According to one report, the opening night in Manchester had 18,000 empty seats.\nSo what\u2019s changed?\n- Published4 June 2024\n- Published10 May 2024\n- Published19 April 2024\n- Published20 October 2022\nHer pandemic era albums Folklore and Evermore were a significant turning point \u2013 with the subtle, indie-folk arrangements winning over critics and fans who had previously been unimpressed by her country and pop hits.\nThe rise of TikTok introduced her to a new audience, while the on-going project of re-recording her first six albums rejuvenated her older hits.\n\u201cShe is just one of those rare timeless artists who gets it right every time,\u201d says fellow pop star Raye. \u201cShe\u2019s an absolute powerhouse.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s such a fantastic role model,\u201d adds Scottish singer-songwriter KT Tunstall.\n\u201cShe\u2019s got the resilience and the chutzpah to be the boss of an enormous machine, employing thousands of people. To be able to handle that and handle what\u2019s coming at her publicly, you\u2019ve just got to be a one-off.\u201d\nLana Del Rey, who duetted with Swift on the 2022 song Snow On The Beach, has another theory about the star\u2019s dominance.\n\u201cShe wants it,\u201d the singer told BBC News.\n\u201cShe\u2019s told me so many times that she wants it more than anyone. And how amazing - she\u2019s getting exactly what she wants.\n\u201cShe\u2019s driven, and I think it\u2019s really paid off.\u201d\nFor fans, it\u2019s the personal connection that makes Swift so special. They hear themselves in her lyrics, as she navigates love, illness, treacherous friendships, and finding your place in the world.\n\u201cTo see someone flourish like Taylor has, it gives hope to the rest of us,\u201d one young fan told me at a playback for Swift\u2019s latest album, The Tortured Poets Department, in April.\n\u201cYou have this amazingly powerful woman, who goes through it ten-fold because of the media \u2013 but she is just continually growing,\u201d added another. \u201cShe\u2019s such an inspiration.\u201d\nIn Edinburgh, that sentiment was shared by Lily Meldrum and Grace Donaldson, who were first in the queue for the opening night of Swift's UK dates.\n\"I feel like she\u2019s the voice for girls everywhere,\" said Grace, who'd come from Aberdeen for the concert.\n\"There\u2019s a song for every occasion. When you feel good, when you feel bad...\n\"When you feel sad,\" added Lily.\n\"Everything you\u2019ve ever felt, there\u2019s a song and it makes you feel like you\u2019re not alone.\"\nKaty Ellis, who has been performing as a Taylor Swift tribute act for more than a decade, agrees.\n\u201cI never get sick of singing the songs,\u201d she says. \u201cDepending on your mood, you can go, \u2018Oh, I relate to this one today\u2019. And I think that\u2019s why she\u2019s so popular.\u201d\nSwift is aware that relatability is her USP. In concert, she continually uses pronouns like \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d when she addresses the crowd.\nAnd every tour stop gets two unique songs, tailored to the local crowd, during the star's acoustic set. In Scotland, fans are already theorising she'll play Guilty As Sin, as it references local band The Blue Nile.\nUnlike Beyonc\u00e9 and Madonna\u2019s recent tours, where the driving thesis seemed to be, \u201ccast your eyes upon these divine beings, in whose presence you must bow down\u201d, the Eras tour is more like a celebration: \"Hey you guys, we did this together!\"\n\u201cI thought to myself \u2018How can I keep our connection going?\u2019 So I decided to make and release as many albums as humanly possible,\u201d Swift told the audience at California\u2019s SoFi Stadium last year.\n\u201cPeople around me were saying\u2026 \u2018What are you going to do - a tour where you just play all the music, and it\u2019s just three and and a half hours long?\u2019\n\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Yeah, well, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s called the Eras Tour.'\u201d\nGet in touch\nAre you attending the concert? Share your experiences"

      "text": "End of an era as 'proud' Taylor Swift finishes tour\n- Published\nTaylor Swift thanked her fans for making the Eras Tour \"the most exciting, powerful, electrifying, intense, most challenging\" experience of her life, as she played the closing show in Vancouver on Sunday.\nPrior to playing All Too Well, Swift told the audience in Canada that she had been \"touring since I was 15 years old\", but the experiences of the past 21 months had been \"completely unrecognisable\" from anything she'd ever done before.\n\"I never thought that writing one line about friendship bracelets would have you guys all making friendship bracelets, making friends and bringing joy to each other.\n\"That is the lasting legacy of this tour,\" she added. \"I couldn't be more proud of you.\"\nThe lyric about friendship bracelets, from the song You're On Your Own Kid, external, spawned a cottage industry of hand-crafted accessories, which were swapped and traded by the millions of fans who attended the tour - including, at one London show, Sir Paul McCartney., external\nSwift said the community her fans had created would always be \"what I think about when I think about this tour\".\nThey responded by serenading Swift with a chorus of Happy Birthday - ahead of her turning 35 next Friday.\n\"You guys even sang a happy early birthday to Taylor?\" noted the tour's official social media account, external. \"We love you so much!\"\n13 Times Taylor Swift Made History\nTake a watch through Taylor Swift's history - from dizzying Grammy records to reaching billionaire status and everything in between.\n- Published7 December 2024\n- Published8 June 2024\n- Published7 June 2024\nThe Eras Tour kicked off in Arizona in March 2023 with an epic, 44-song setlist that lasted more than three hours.\nThe appetite for tickets was so great that Ticketmaster's systems broke down, prompting a hearing into the company in the US Senate.\nDespite that, more than 10.1 million tickets were sold for the tour's 149 shows, spanning five continents, over almost two years.\nLast December, it became the first tour in history to surpass $1bn (\u00a3786m) in ticket sales. At its conclusion, that figure totalled $2,077,618,725 (\u00a31.63 billion), said Taylor Swift Touring, the star\u2019s production company.\nMerchandise has also proven to be a lucrative source of revenue, with estimates that it has brought in an extra $400m (\u00a3314m).\nThe final stop was watched by more than 60,000 fans in Vancouver's BC Place stadium. One fan-hosted live-stream from the venue was followed by another 389,000 people on YouTube.\nSwift was in a nostalgic mood throughout, calling the show \"one last grand adventure\" with her fans.\nAs she played Cardigan, from her pandemic-era album Folklore, the reality of the situation started to sink in.\n\"It's just crazy to think I'm going to sing the last song I ever sing in the Folklore cabin,\" she said. \"That's wild. Oh my God!\"\nAnd she paid tribute to her band, dancers and crew, \"who all left their families\" behind and \"performed when they were sick [or] anything was going on in their lives\" to keep the show on the road.\nSentimental acoustic set\nFor the acoustic set - which showcases songs missing from the standard setlist - the star said she had tried to choose tracks that \"really encapsulate how I feel\" about the final show.\nOn guitar, she played a mash-up of A Place In This World, from her debut album, and 1989's New Romantics, with the apposite lyric: \"Heartbreak is the national anthem / We sing it proudly.\"\nMoving to the piano, she played Long Live, tweaking the words from \"It was the end of a decade\" to \"It was the end of an era\" - prompting a huge cheer from the audience.\nContinuing the theme, she added elements of New Year's Day, a song about holding on to memories, and The Manuscript, whose story of heartbreak became a metaphor for the tour coming to an end.\n\"Now and then I re-read the manuscript / But the story isn't mine anymore.\"\nFans noted that the selection meant the acoustic sets had kicked off in 2023 with Tim McGraw, the first song in her discography, and ended with The Manuscript, the most recent.\nOnly six songs from her 11 studio albums were not performed on the tour: That's When, Bye Bye Baby, Girl At Home, Ronan, Forever Winter and Soon You'll Get Better.\nSwift was watched from the audience by her mother Andrea - but her boyfriend, American football player Travis Kelce, had to miss the show to play (and win) a home game with his team, the Kansas City Chiefs.\nFans had predicted she would use the last concert to announce her next career move. Top of their wish-list was the reveal of Reputation (Taylor's Version) - the latest in the star's plan to re-record the first six albums in her discography.\nIn the end, there were no big surprises or special guests.\nInstead, the Eras Tour got to bow out on its own terms - celebrating 18 years of music that has united people around the world.\nAs she cued up the set-closer, Karma, Swift thanked her fans one last time.\n\"I want to thank every single one of you for being a part of the most thrilling chapter of my entire life to date - my beloved Eras Tour.\"\nShe dedicated the song to Kelce, changing the lyrics to \"Karma is the guy on The Chiefs coming straight home to me\", as she has done several times since they started dating last year.\nOver the dying notes of the song, Swift shared an emotional hug with her dancers and backing singers. And rather than making her traditional exit of being lowered beneath the stage, she opted to walk out with her team, external.\nIt was, quite literally, the end of an era. We're unlikely to see another tour on this scale for a long time."
