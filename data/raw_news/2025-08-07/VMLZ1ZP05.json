  "content": "I'll never forget the night I turned in my apartment keys, said my goodbyes to family and friends, and prepared to fly out early the next morning to my new home in Tulsa, Oklahoma.I cried the entire night, convinced I would regret leaving the familiarity of New York for a state I'd never visited and had no ties or connections to.People literally move to New York to chase their dreams, and here I was, a single woman in her 50s, about to leave. However, I knew the change was necessary.Now that I've been living in Oklahoma for two years, I've come to realize just how perfectly aligned my decision was, and how my move has primed me for the next phase of my life and career.I grew up in Brooklyn and lived in the nearby suburb of Pelham, New York, for over 20 years. Because of the town's quaint charm and proximity to the city, I expected to live there forever.But in 2022, my apartment building was sold to developers who wanted to renovate it. I'd have to leave my home during the renovations, only to return to a rent bill that would've doubled.So, I decided to look for a new place to call home. Luckily, I worked remotely, which opened up my options quite a bit.During my search, I came across the Tulsa Remote program, which incentivizes remote workers to move to the city with a $10,000 stipend paid out over the course of a year.The application process was simple, and I had a video interview with a member of the Tulsa Remote team. About a week later, I got an official email confirmation that I'd been accepted into the program.The $10,000 stipend I received helped to offset the price of my move, which ended up costing close to $7,000 between hiring movers and traveling to Tulsa.Additionally, I found the rent to be much more affordable here, especially considering how much I get for my money.I had a good life back in New York, but moving allowed me to upgrade my living situation dramatically. I moved into my dream apartment, a spacious, $1,600-a-month one-bedroom right across from the Arkansas River and within walking distance of a beautiful park.I also got access to a pool, parking space, in-unit washer and dryer, and river views that would have remained a dream had I stayed in New York. But in Tulsa, it became my reality.After all, my far more basic New York apartment would've cost around $3,500 a month after the changes to my rent.Before moving, I was also struggling to pay off some substantial credit card debt. Luckily, the lower cost of living in Tulsa allowed me to chip away at the amount I owed, and now, I'm well on my way to being debt-free by the end of the year.There's so much to do in the city, and thankfully, Tulsa Remote has been wonderful at building community among its participants.As a member of the program, I have access to monthly events like art exhibits and musical performances at nearby parks and venues, networking events with fellow Tulsa Remoters, and excursions to nearby restaurants and other fun establishments. It's really helped us to come together and find connection easily and seamlessly in our new city.By attending these events, I've made a handful of new friends and find great comfort in knowing that should I desire, I can tap into the network and easily expand my social circle even more.I've also been pleasantly surprised by the eclectic and acclaimed culinary scene in Tulsa, which continues to impress me two years later. It seems like every time I go on social media, I discover a new restaurant or bar that I'm excited to try.The music in Tulsa is also incredible. Artists like Pink, Bad Bunny, and Hozier have played at Tulsa's primary concert facility, the BOK Center. So far, I've already seen Joy Oladokun and the Wu-Tang Clan perform there.After living in Tulsa for two years, I have absolutely no regrets about making the move. More importantly, I've overcome my fear of exploring new spaces and places.I've been putting myself out there, building my career, reading poetry at events, and creating a life for myself I never could have imagined.Although I don't have a ton of friends here, the people I do have in my life have supported me in ways I'd never experienced before.I have a sense of peace and comfort, and a desire to create that I didn't have back in New York \u2014 and for me, that's the biggest reward of my move.",
