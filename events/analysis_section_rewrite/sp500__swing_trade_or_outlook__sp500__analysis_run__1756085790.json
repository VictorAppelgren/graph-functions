      "feedback": "The draft hits the required 2 Up/2 Down movers and a Swing Trade, but to reach world-class quality it needs a tighter, first-principles causal backbone, clearer scenario separation, sharper quantification anchored to the provided IDs, and more explicit invalidation triggers. Actions: (1) compress the causal chain into a single, auditable backbone: tariffs/reshoring drive onshore CapEx in semis and AI data centers, backed by energy-grid buildout and a regime of higher risk premia; that onshore activity re-rates capital‑intensive names while autos face EV-margin dispersion—explicitly tie each mover to this chain and cite the exact material IDs for each link (SGB2PAZGK, O4ZEED2EB). (2) Diversify drivers across the four lines so the Up/Downs are not repetitive: one Up should hinge on sustained tariff-driven CapEx momentum; the other Up should hinge on elevated risk premia and onshore ROIC/valuation expansion; one Down should reflect tariff rollback risk or policy pivot; the other Down should hinge on autos/EV profitability dynamics and ROIC trajectories. (3) anchoring and evidence: embed 2–3 precise numbers from the sources (e.g., 10% baseline tariff, 145% reciprocal stance, Ford EV losses ~$1.3B and ROIC ~10.1%, Netflix revenue growth ~15.9% with FCF ~86.9%) with in-text IDs after the specific claim; avoid non-listed figures and ensure every factual claim has a citation, reconciling any conflicts across sources (e.g., SGB2PAZGK vs O4ZEED2EB vs 65UUBU0OR). (4) sharpen language and format: make each mover line strictly follow Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %; remove redundancy between the two Up lines and ensure one Down line emphasizes policy/path risk while the other emphasizes sector dispersion; add explicit invalidation triggers (e.g., tariff rollback, policy pivot, or capex momentum reversal) and tie them to observable milestones. (5) Swing Trade: keep a single concise line or two only; add concrete entry/stop/target syntax with a price- or trigger-based entry and a clear risk-reward metric, and ensure the trigger and invalidation align with the mover drivers (cite SGB2PAZGK and O4ZEED2EB for the capex/tariff logic). (6) tighten cohesion with the SECTION FOCUS by centering the lines around a single, coherent regime narrative rather than a mosaic of auto/tech facts; maintain consistency in terminology (CapEx, onshore, data centers) and remove extraneous references (e.g., Netflix/Disney minutiae) unless they directly illuminate the regime-tilt. If you prefer, I can supply a compact, fully revised 4-line Movers block plus a 1-line Swing Trade that satisfies all formatting, probability anchoring, and citation requirements in one pass.",
