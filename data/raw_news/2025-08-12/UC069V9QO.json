  "content": "Shares of building materials manufacturer UFP Industries (NASDAQ:UFPI) jumped 3.7% in the afternoon session after the stock rallied along with the broader industrials sector, fueled by optimism for a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut and an extension of the U.S.-China tariff truce. The rally in the industrials sector was driven by a favorable inflation report, which boosted investor hopes that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates. Lower rates would reduce borrowing costs for businesses, making it cheaper to invest in equipment and stimulating economic activity. This prospect particularly benefits cyclical sectors like construction and manufacturing, which are sensitive to capital investment. Adding to the positive sentiment, the U.S. and China agreed to extend their trade truce, delaying tariffs and alleviating concerns about trade disruptions. This pause provides relief for companies with global supply chains and offers greater certainty for medium- to long-term business planning.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $102.56, up 4.1% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy UFP Industries? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nUFP Industries\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 7 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 27 days ago when the stock gained 3.6% on the news that its UFP Packaging division unveiled the U-Loc 200, a new and innovative crate system that can be assembled and disassembled without tools. This new patent-pending fastener system is designed to address a major safety concern in the shipping industry, as it eliminates the need for nail and staple guns, which contribute to thousands of emergency room visits each year. By providing a safer and more efficient crating solution, the U-Loc 200 is also fully reusable, which could appeal to customers focused on sustainability and cost-effectiveness. The introduction of this unique product positions UFP Industries as a leader in packaging innovation and could help it capture a larger share of the market by solving key customer challenges.\n\nUFP Industries is down 7.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $102.54 per share, it is trading 26.2% below its 52-week high of $139.02 from November 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of UFP Industries\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,612.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

      "text": "UFP Industries (UFPI)\nWe\u2019re skeptical of UFP Industries. Its weak sales growth and declining returns on capital show its demand and profits are shrinking.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think UFP Industries Will Underperform\nBeginning as a lumber supplier in the 1950s, UFP Industries (NASDAQ:UFPI) is a holding company making building materials for the construction, retail, and industrial sectors.\n- Demand will likely be weak over the next 12 months as Wall Street expects flat revenue\n- Competitive supply chain dynamics and steep production costs are reflected in its low gross margin of 17.8%\n- A positive is that its ROIC punches in at 22.5%, illustrating management\u2019s expertise in identifying profitable investments\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than UFP Industries\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than UFP Industries\nAt $98.51 per share, UFP Industries trades at 15.3x forward P/E. UFP Industries\u2019s valuation may seem like a bargain, especially when stacked up against other industrials companies. We remind you that you often get what you pay for, though.\nCheap stocks can look like great bargains at first glance, but you often get what you pay for. These mediocre businesses often have less earnings power, meaning there is more reliance on a re-rating to generate good returns - an unlikely scenario for low-quality companies.\n3. UFP Industries (UFPI) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nBuilding materials manufacturer UFP Industries (NASDAQ:UFPI) missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales falling 3.5% year on year to $1.84 billion. Its GAAP profit of $1.70 per share was 8.7% below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nUFP Industries (UFPI) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $1.84 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.87 billion (3.5% year-on-year decline, 1.9% miss)\n- EPS (GAAP): $1.70 vs analyst expectations of $1.86 (8.7% miss)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $174.1 million vs analyst estimates of $179.7 million (9.5% margin, 3.1% miss)\n- Operating Margin: 6.7%, down from 8.4% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 9.8%, similar to the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $6.21 billion\nCompany Overview\nBeginning as a lumber supplier in the 1950s, UFP Industries (NASDAQ:UFPI) is a holding company making building materials for the construction, retail, and industrial sectors.\nHeadquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan, UFP Industries has established itself as a significant player in the wood products industry. The company supplies products primarily manufactured from wood and other materials to the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Europe, Asia, and Australia.\nUFP Industries operates through three business segments: UFP Retail Solutions, UFP Industrial, and UFP Construction.\nUFP Retail Solutions serves national home center retailers, retail-oriented regional lumberyards, and contractor-oriented lumberyards. The company supplies these customers from multiple locations, offering a mix of dimensional lumber (both preserved and unpreserved). The UFP Industrial segment caters to manufacturers and agricultural customers who use pallets, specialty crates, wooden boxes, and other containers for packaging, shipping, and material handling purposes. UFP Construction serves four primary markets: factory-built housing, site-built residential construction, commercial construction, and concrete forming.\n4. Building Materials\nTraditionally, building materials companies have built competitive advantages with economies of scale, brand recognition, and strong relationships with builders and contractors. More recently, advances to address labor availability and job site productivity have spurred innovation. Additionally, companies in the space that can produce more energy-efficient materials have opportunities to take share. However, these companies are at the whim of construction volumes, which tend to be cyclical and can be impacted heavily by economic factors such as interest rates. Additionally, the costs of raw materials can be driven by a myriad of worldwide factors and greatly influence the profitability of building materials companies.\nOther companies that manufacture wood building products include Boise Cascade (NYSE:BCC), Weyerhaeuser (NYSE:WY), and Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX)\n5. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last five years, UFP Industries grew its sales at a decent 8.1% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth was slightly above the average industrials company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss new industry trends or demand cycles. UFP Industries\u2019s recent performance marks a sharp pivot from its five-year trend as its revenue has shown annualized declines of 10.1% over the last two years.\nThis quarter, UFP Industries missed Wall Street\u2019s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 3.5% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $1.84 billion of revenue.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3.7% over the next 12 months. While this projection implies its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance, it is still below average for the sector.\n6. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nUFP Industries has bad unit economics for an industrials business, signaling it operates in a competitive market. As you can see below, it averaged a 17.8% gross margin over the last five years. Said differently, UFP Industries had to pay a chunky $82.18 to its suppliers for every $100 in revenue.\nIn Q2, UFP Industries produced a 17% gross profit margin, marking a 2 percentage point decrease from 19.1% in the same quarter last year. UFP Industries\u2019s full-year margin has also been trending down over the past 12 months, decreasing by 2.5 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest a more competitive environment with some pressure to lower prices and higher input costs (such as raw materials and manufacturing expenses).\n7. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses \u2013 everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It\u2019s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\nUFP Industries has done a decent job managing its cost base over the last five years. The company has produced an average operating margin of 8.4%, higher than the broader industrials sector.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, UFP Industries\u2019s operating margin decreased by 1.3 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability.\nIn Q2, UFP Industries generated an operating margin profit margin of 6.7%, down 1.7 percentage points year on year. Since UFP Industries\u2019s gross margin decreased more than its operating margin, we can assume its recent inefficiencies were driven more by weaker leverage on its cost of sales rather than increased marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead expenses.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nUFP Industries\u2019s EPS grew at a remarkable 12.5% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 8.1% annualized revenue growth. However, we take this with a grain of salt because its operating margin didn\u2019t improve and it didn\u2019t repurchase its shares, meaning the delta came from reduced interest expenses or taxes.\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business.\nUFP Industries\u2019s two-year annual EPS declines of 20.5% were bad and lower than its two-year revenue performance.\nDiving into the nuances of UFP Industries\u2019s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. UFP Industries\u2019s operating margin has declined by 2.8 percentage points over the last two years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; interest expenses and taxes can also affect EPS but don\u2019t tell us as much about a company\u2019s fundamentals.\nIn Q2, UFP Industries reported EPS at $1.70, down from $2.05 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts\u2019 estimates, but we care more about long-term EPS growth than short-term movements. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects UFP Industries\u2019s full-year EPS of $5.80 to grow 11.7%.\n9. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nUFP Industries has shown mediocre cash profitability over the last five years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 5.3%, subpar for an industrials business.\nTaking a step back, an encouraging sign is that UFP Industries\u2019s margin expanded by 4.5 percentage points during that time. The company\u2019s improvement shows it\u2019s heading in the right direction, and we can see it became a less capital-intensive business because its free cash flow profitability rose while its operating profitability fell.\nUFP Industries\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $180.8 million in Q2, equivalent to a 9.8% margin. This cash profitability was in line with the comparable period last year and above its five-year average.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAlthough UFP Industries hasn\u2019t been the highest-quality company lately, it found a few growth initiatives in the past that worked out wonderfully. Its five-year average ROIC was 22.5%, splendid for an industrials business.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, UFP Industries\u2019s ROIC has decreased significantly over the last few years. We like what management has done in the past, but its declining returns are perhaps a symptom of fewer profitable growth opportunities.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nCompanies with more cash than debt have lower bankruptcy risk.\nUFP Industries is a profitable, well-capitalized company with $874 million of cash and $234.3 million of debt on its balance sheet. This $639.6 million net cash position is 10.3% of its market cap and gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n12. Key Takeaways from UFP Industries\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe struggled to find many positives in these results as its revenue and EPS fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, this was a weaker quarter. The stock traded down 1.3% to $103 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy UFP Industries?\nUpdated: August 11, 2025 at 11:37 PM EDT\nWhen considering an investment in UFP Industries, investors should account for its valuation and business qualities as well as what\u2019s happened in the latest quarter.\nUFP Industries isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. Although its revenue growth was decent over the last five years, it\u2019s expected to deteriorate over the next 12 months and its diminishing returns show management's prior bets haven't worked out. And while the company\u2019s stellar ROIC suggests it has been a well-run company historically, the downside is its unit sales declined.\nUFP Industries\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 15.3x. While this valuation is reasonable, we don\u2019t really see a big opportunity at the moment. We're fairly confident there are better stocks to buy right now.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $118.40 on the company (compared to the current share price of $98.51).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."
