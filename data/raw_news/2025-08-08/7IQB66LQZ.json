But nothing quite hit the market like the July nonfarm payrolls report, which showed clear deceleration in the employment economy. A soft July nonfarm payrolls number combined with significant downward revisions in June and May payrolls resulted in three-month average payrolls growth of just 35,000. Unemployment was a still-low 4.2%, and wage growth remained healthy at 3.9% on an annual basis. But uncertainty about the economic outlook and the impact of tariff policy appears to be causing employers to slow hiring plans. As of August 1, 2025, tariffs were in place for a multitude of countries and set to take effect on August 7. While that eliminates the uncertainty of not knowing what tariffs would be, it does not eliminate the uncertainty of how tariffs will impact consumer and business spending, demand for U.S. goods overseas, and inflation, among other factors. The Economy, Interest Rates, and Earnings In the second quarter of 2025, gross domestic product was impacted by actions taken in the first quarter in anticipation of stiff tariffs. Imports, which rose about 40% in the first quarter, collapsed in the second quarter, given massive pre-ordering from overseas. The subtraction to GDP from imports drove mid-single-digit GDP growth. The Trump administration has finalized deals or announced tariffs on multiple nations, although final details are still being worked out with key trading partners such as Canada and China. We expect trade uncertainty to continue to impact GDP growth in the next few quarters. The first (advance) report of second-quarter 2025 GDP indicated growth of 3.0%, bouncing back from a 0.5% decline for 1Q25. Beyond the headline number. Imports, which are a subtraction to the calculation of GDP, declined 30.3% in 2Q25 after spiking 37.9% in 1Q25. The increase in 2Q25 GDP also reflected growth in consumer spending, partly offset by a decrease in business spending and exports. The value of imported goods in 2Q25 decreased by $346 billion in 2Q25, after increasing by $309 billion in 1Q25. Imports (which subtract from GDP) represented a 5.18 percentage-point contribution to 2Q25 GDP growth, after representing a 4.66 percentage-point reduction to 1Q25 GDP growth. The dearth of imports in 2Q25 was reflected in the drawdown in private inventories, which subtracted 3.17 percentage points to 2Q25 GDP after adding 2.59 percentage points to 1Q25 GDP. After a highly volatile first half, the impacts of imports and private inventories on overall GDP should moderate in the second half. However, these categories could remain more volatile than in the past, at least into year-end. Beyond these headlines, other parts of the economy grew in the second quarter, but at a subdued pace. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) for 2Q25 rose 1.4%, up from 0.5% for 1Q25. PCE contributed 0.98 percentage-points to GDP in the period. Durable goods spending rebounded by 3.7%, led by vehicles, while nondurables spending rose 1.3%. The largest PCE category of services spending increased 1.1% in 2Q25, better than 0.6% in the first quarter. We expect PCE within the GDP accounts to continue to send conflicting signals in 2025, while moving back into the 1%-3% range as the final tariff regime becomes established. Nonresidential fixed investment, the proxy for corporate capital spending, rose by 1.9% in 2Q25; that is a sharp step-down from 10.3% in 1Q25. This category grew in the 6%-7% range over 2023-24. Business spending slowed in 2Q25 after a 1Q25 boost from companies seeking to invest in infrastructure before tariffs were put in place. Nonresidential fixed investment added just 0.26 percentage points to 2Q25 GDP. Overall government spending edged up 0.4% in 2Q25 after being down 0.6% in the final 1Q25 GDP report. Defense spending rose 2.2%, while nondefense spending was down 11.2% in 2Q25 from the first quarter. State and local government spending grew 3.0%, as local governments in some cases pick up functions dropped by the federal government. The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 2.1% for 2Q25, after rising 3.4% for 1Q25, and the core PCE price index advanced 2.5%. The Fed needs both GDP growth and lower price increases to cut rates going forward. Elsewhere, investors received a shock on the state of the jobs economy, amid continued positive signs about corporate earnings. The perception that the economy is holding steady as tariffs are put in place was shattered by the jobs number; restoring confidence in the economy may prove difficult. The U.S. economy generated just 73,000 new nonfarm jobs in July, as hiring slowed and unemployment ticked higher. Severe downward revisions to job counts from June and May caused three-month average jobs growth to drop to 35,000, from a solid but misleading 150,000 before the report. The revisions prompted the president to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The BLS Diffusion Index indicated that 51.2% of 250 private industries were hiring in July. The unemployment rate reached 4.2% for July, up a tick from 4.1% in June. Average hourly earnings grew 3.9% annually in July, about in line with the annual growth trend in 2025 to date. New claims for unemployment insurance remain relatively low. Most of the more-than 250,000 federal employees let go by DOGE are still on severance and thus not listed yet as unemployed. The quality of jobs is perceived as weakening; manufacturing shed 11,000 jobs in July; healthcare and services added 73,000. The steep job revisions caused bond prices to spike and the stock market to sell off; it also increased the likelihood of a September rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Industrial production rose 0.3% in June after being unchanged in May and April. Utilities output rose 2.8%, while manufacturing edged up 0.1% and mining output declined. Capacity utilization came in at 77.6% in June, remaining about two percentage points below the long-run average. The ISM manufacturing PMI ticked down to 48.0 for June from 48.5 for May, near its 2025 low of 47.9 for March. Purchasing managers are anticipating that tariffs will incentivize companies to shift from overseas manufacturing to onshore production, but the timing of such shifts is uncertain. The services PMI in June 2025 was 50.8, as improvement in the business activity index was offset by a declining employment index. Business and consumer sentiment are both off their tariff-shock lows; these surveys were conducted before the July payrolls data. The NFIB's Small Business Optimism Index, which reached a six-year high of 105.1 in December 2024, has been declining amid on-again, off-again tariff policy. It bounced to 98.8 in May and was at 98.6 in June, from a low of 95.8 in April. The index is back above its 51-year average of 98.0, although respondents are reporting excess inventories. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment data has continued to improve. The overall index rose to 61.7 in July from 60.7 in June. The current economic conditions index also improved from June. The Bureau of Economic Analysis within the Commerce Department reported that personal incomes rose 0.3% in June after falling 0.4% in May; that followed growth in the 0.6%-0.8% range for February, March, and April. Consumer incomes drive consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of GDP growth. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) gained 0.3% for the month of June after dipping 0.1% in May. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model is estimating that third-quarter GDP will grow 2.1%. That represents a modest decline from 2Q25 GDP; we believe there could be some movement in the preliminary and final 2Q25 GDP reports. Argus Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, has been encouraged by the economy's resilience, while monitoring consumer and business caution about the now-stabilizing tariff economy. Chris is modeling 1% growth in 2025 GDP and believes GDP growth is likely to accelerate slightly in 2026 to 1.5%. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve met in the final week of July and, as expected, maintained rates at the fed funds tendency of 4.25%-4.50%. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought has led the Trump team effort to accelerate Jerome Powell's departure. Argus Fixed Income Strategist Kevin Heal, who is the Argus voice on all things Fed, expects Powell to finish his term as Fed chair, which ends in May 2026. The July FOMC meeting concluded two days before the soft July jobs data and surprise downward revisions in prior-month payrolls and the Fed is now in something of a quandary. If the jobs economy is indeed slowing and needs stimulus, that argues for a September rate cut. The worrisome core PCE reading, which shows inflation creeping higher, argues for maintaining the fed funds rate at current levels. Other data provide mixed messages. GDP has been so distorted by trade pre-positioning that it is not sending many useful signals. And the earnings season, as noted, is an indicator of what was and not what is to come. Even as the jobs economy shows worrisome trends, inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. Following the June FOMC meeting, the central bank amended its economic growth outlook slightly in a bearish direction. The Fed looks for 1.4% GDP growth in 2025 and expects an unemployment rate at year-end 2025 of 4.5%. The Fed is also modeling inflation to end 2025 at an annual 3.1% growth rate. The Fed's so-called 'dot plot' continues to signal two quarter-point rate cuts in the second half of 2025. But for the first time in this cycle, voting Fed members such as Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman are publicly dissenting from the Fed's stand-pat posture. Bond investors are also jugging many data points. While watching the deteriorating jobs economy, bond investors are concerned that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could add to the national deficit and exert upward pressure on bond yields. Washington's tariff policies and rising deficit projections risk reducing the attractiveness of U.S. Treasury debt as the ultimate safe haven. Recent bond auctions have met with tepid response, particularly from overseas investors. But market interest rates came down following the July jobs data. The 10-year Treasury yield was 4.23% as of the end of July 2025, compared with 4.29% as of the end of June. The cycle peak for the 10-year yield was 4.9% in October 2023. The two-year Treasury yield was 3.69% as of the end of July 2025, vs. 3.73% as of the end of June. The cycle peak for the two-year yield was 5.2% as of October 2023. The extended period of yield-curve inversion is decisively finished. Over time, Argus expects short-term yields to move lower from current levels. Long yields over time are expected to widen their relative premium to short yields while also coming down. Argus Fixed Income Strategist Kevin Heal continues to model two quarter-point rate cuts in 2025, most likely in September and December. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability of a rate cut at the September FOMC meeting is now above 87%. Argus also acknowledges the possibility that the Fed holds rates unchanged in 2025. The Fed is cognizant that tariffs historically are associated with higher goods price. Were inflation to rise from current levels, we believe this Fed would be likely to hold steady and even consider raising rates again. Investors went into 2Q25 earning season expecting EPS growth in the low-single-digit range, which, if realized, would be the lowest since 4Q23. As of the end of July, with about 65% of component companies having reported results, S&P 500 earnings from continuing operations are forecast to grow between 6% and 8% from 2Q24, according to the blended growth estimates from Bloomberg, FactSet, and Refinitiv. Over 80% of companies have exceeded consensus growth expectations, and the magnitude of the earnings beat against expectation has been about 6%. As a reminder, these are blended estimates, which include actual reported results along with consensus estimates from Wall Street analysts. As another reminder, actual results exceed Street expectations by 5%-9% in most quarters. For the quarter to date, the magnitude of the beat against expectation has been about 6%. Four of the Magnificent 7 companies reported in the final week of July and surpassed lofty expectations. Altogether, 2Q25 earnings growth could come in at a final high-single-digit or even low-double-digit growth rate from 2Q24. Earnings growth at high-single-digit rates would represent slowing from low-double-digit growth in the preceding three quarter of 3Q24 through 1Q25 For 2025, we are reiterating our forecast for S&P 500 earnings from continuing operations of $270. Our 2025 EPS estimate implies full-year EPS growth of 10%. For the middle quarters of 2025, we have conservative growth assumptions for certain sectors including Consumer Discretionary, Healthcare, and Industrial. Consumer Discretionary faces the triple whammy of already-high goods inflation, the potential for further price hikes due to tariffs, and too-high financing rates for large-ticket items. We have cut our growth forecast for Healthcare earnings due to pressure on insurance company earnings and the potential for White House-mandated lower drug prices. Industrial earnings could be impacted by reduced foreign demand for big-ticket equipment (machine tools, commercial aircraft, etc.). For 2026, we estimate S&P 500 continuing operations earnings of $300, which assumes EPS growth of 11%. Whereas 2025 EPS is forecast to be strong in the first and last quarters and weak in the middle quarters, our 2026 EPS growth forecast calls for more stable quarterly performance amid partly subdued growth across 2026. Domestic and Global Markets Stocks hit their 2025 trading year lows in the aftermath of President Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs announced early in April. Stocks have since staged a three-plus month rally, with the only hitch coming following the weak July nonfarm payrolls data. Seven months and one very eventful nonfarm payrolls Friday into 2025, the stock market is in solidly positive territory year to date (YTD). The S&P 500 was up 6.8% YTD at the end of July after being up 5.6% at the end of June. The Nasdaq was up 7.4% YTD at the end of July after being 5.4% YTD at the end of June. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the only major index to decline across July and was up 3.4% at the seven-month mark after being up 3.9% at the end of June. Wilshire Large Cap Growth was up 13.4% YTD as of the end of July, rising 5.6 percentage points in just a month as investors piled back into AI stocks. The Russell 2000 remains down year to date by 2.1%, even though these smaller, domestic-facing companies are expected to be less-impacted by tariffs. The Barclays Bloomberg U.S. Bond Index was up 3.6% year to date at the end of July 2025, little changed from June. Bond returns bounced around all through 2024, and there is no reason to assume they will be stable in 2025. Sector Performance For much of 4Q24 and all of 1Q25, investors rotated away from traditional growth leadership and toward defensive, interest-rate-sensitive, and cyclical sectors. In the second quarter of 2025, growth stocks came back into favor on stock-price weakness for well-known names. Sector leaders in Information Technology and Communication Service were helped by well-above-consensus earnings for calendar 1Q25 -- and that has continued in 2Q25 earnings season. Rotation back to traditional growth sector leadership continued in May and intensified in June. In what we see as a positive shift, growth sectors have moved to the sidelines after their dazzling April to mid-July run. Investors in late July have been buying stocks in defensive, rate-sensitive, and cyclical sectors favored in the first quarter but neglected in the second. The market in 2025 to date has been a tag-team match, with growth and nontraditional sectors regularly handing off and regaining leadership. As a result, all but two sectors have appreciated year to date, and no sector is running away from the pack. Four sectors are up in double-digit-percentages year to date, and none is up more than 15%. The two leaders are nontraditional: Utilities are up 15.0% as of the end of July, and Industrials are up 14.4%. In third place is Communication Services, up 12.0%, followed by the traditional growth leader Information Technology, which is up 11.3%. The remaining five sectors are all up in mid- to high-single-digit percentages year to date. This kind of balance and breadth creates a positive set-up that could enable the market to build on existing gains into year-end. Many sectors have had clear leadership stocks. Argus believes investors may take more of a bargain-hunter's approach for the remainder of 2025, with less regard to sector trends. Investors have moved to a 'prove it' mentality regarding the AI trade -- and in 2Q25 earnings season, AI companies have so far delivered. Partially for that reason, investors continue to put money into the AI names within the Information Technology sector. Investors also pushed up non-growth sectors in broadly rallying July. The net impact on market weightings has been a new all-time high for Information Technology (adjusted for past removals of social media and FinTech). For a handful of sectors, current weightings have slipped below the long-term weighting range even though some of these sectors are positive year to date. Information Technology began August with a 34.0% weighting, up 90 basis points in just a month and up 2.6 percentage points year over year. The biggest loser continues to be Healthcare, which ended July with an 8.8% weighting -- below its long-term distribution range of 10%-15%. Healthcare weight in the S&P 500 in July declined 50 basis points (bps) from the end of June and 3.1 percentage points from July 2024. The Energy and Consumer Staples sectors also posted meaningful annual weighting declines. Energy had a 3.0% weighting at the end of July, below its long-run range of 4%-10%. Staples weighed in at 5.2%, below its long-run range of 6%-16%. Energy has shed 70 bps of weight in the past year, while Staples is down 60 bps. Besides IT, two other growth sectors have gained weight in the past year. Communication Services ended July with a 9.9% weighting, up 100 basis points year over year. And Consumer Discretionary, despite declining in the year to date, ended July with a 10.4% weighting, up 40 bps year over year. Financial, with a 13.8% weighting, is also up year over year though down from 14.0% at the end of June. AI is not just disrupting the economy and the stock market. It is reordering where businesses and consumers put their money. As this transformative technology continues to reshape the world, we look for additional disruption in relative sector performance and sector weights. Like the U.S. market, global stocks did better in 2023 than they did in 2022; and most carried that momentum across 2024. In 2025, overseas markets generally have been doing better than the U.S. market. But tariffs, now that they are in place, have realigned leadership. All nine global bourses in our tally are positive for the 2025 year as of the end of July, but leadership has changed since early in the year. The Eurozone slipped 3% in July after it was perceived to have gotten the wrong end of its trade deal with the U.S. The UK strengthened in July partly because it is the only major trading partner with a 10% tariff. Some of the worst markets in 2024, such as Mexico, are near the top of the leaderboard in 2025 as that country continues final tariff negotiations. Conversely, some of 2024's winners, such as India and Japan, are relatively underperforming in 2025. In terms of our themes, resources economies are up 13.0% and lead the pack. Americas markets are up 11.4%. BRICs-minus-Russia are up 9.4% year to date after rising 4.2% in 2024. Asian markets are up 10.2%. Mature economies, which led in 2024 and 2023, are up 8.0%, reflecting relative weakness in Japan and the U.S. Conclusion The tariff economy is now fully operational, and a stock market that has chugged through seven months of uncertainty has more uncertainty ahead. The S&P 500 ended July 2025 just below all-time highs, after the July nonfarm payrolls report dispersed some of the market optimism that had sent stocks soaring. August and September historically have been some of the weakest months for the S&P 500. But the market has been ignoring the calendar all year long and instead trading on the very real changes in policy and in the economy. We expect that to continue into year-end. The data discussed above is necessarily backward looking; but that does not mean it has no value. On balance, we believe it provides a reasonably strong basis for further stock-market gains into year-end, even if the road is bumpier than before.\nRaises guidance after another strong quarter\nPalantir develops and provides software that enables customers from government agencies to commercial enterprises to integrate data for decision-making and operations at scale. The company initially provided its software to the U.S. intelligence services before broadening its customer base. 55% of company revenue is generated by its government segment and 45% from its commercial segment; 34% of revenue is generated outside the U.S. Palantir's class A shares trade publicly under the symbol PLTR. Palantir's super-voting class B and class F shares, held by insiders and founders, do not trade publicly. The company is effectively controlled by founders Alexander Karp, Stephen Cohen, and Peter Thiel through the super-voting class F shares that represent a 49.99% voting interest. Palantir was founded in 2003 and went public at $10 per share on September 30, 2020.\nRatingPrice TargetWhile the major stock indices didn't do a whole lot on Tuesday, things were certainly ugly under the surface.\nWhile the major stock indices didn't do a whole lot on Tuesday, things were certainly ugly under the surface. The S&P 500 gave back 0.4%, the S&P 100 was flat, and the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 posted minor gains. The real weakness was in the S&P MidCap 400, which fell 1.8%, and the S&P SmallCap 600, which dropped 2.1%. The NYSE fell 1% and breadth was poor, with 1,600 more decliners than advancers. NYSE advancers/total issues was only 21%, while advancing volume/total volume was 34%. Other than one day this month, one in July, and one in May, Tuesday had the worst advance/decline stats since the wipeout in early April. Without gains in the semiconductors, the results would have been much worse. Information Technology (XLK) rose 1% and was the only sector in the green. NVDA, with a market cap above $4 trillion, popped 4.1%; Broadcom ($1.3T market cap) rose 2.1%; and Taiwan Semiconductor ($1.2T market cap) shot up 3.7%. With only a $252 billion market cap, Advanced Micro Devices soared another 6.6% and remains on fire, having doubled since its April low. The other 10 sectors fell between 0.8% and 2.1%, with four down at least 1.5%. Materials was the biggest loser, falling 2.1%. All nine industries in Materials fell, with the biggest casualties being aluminum, mining, gold mining, and nonferrous metals, all losing between 3.3% and 4.4%. Some of the largest Material stocks that led to the sector weakness were BHP Group, down 3%, and Newmont Mining, off 5.7%. Healthcare fell 1.8% on weakness in drug stocks and is the weakest sector in 2025, while Financial, which had been hot of late, lost 1.7%. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)\nRhetoric heated up again in the Middle East on Thursday, sending stock futures down, WTI and Brent prices up, and VIX futures higher by almost 5%.\nRhetoric heated up again in the Middle East on Thursday, sending stock futures down, WTI and Brent prices up, and VIX futures higher by almost 5%. Patterns on the VIX are tough to gauge, but the volatility index looks to be working on a double bottom. There was a five -day/13-day exponential-moving-average (EMA) crossover buy signal on Wednesday, the first bullish indicator since early April. Considering what has transpired geopolitically, we are surprised that option premiums on the S&P 500 (SPX) have not pushed the VIX higher than the current low-20s reading. During the tariff-induces drop in April, the VIX spiked to 60%, but quickly fell back in the early part of May. For the S&P 500, additional big losses could lead to a five-day/13-day EMA crossover sell signal, which would reverse the buy signal from April 24. On the downside, initial support from the 21-day EMA sits at 5,940. The 200-day is down at 5,813 and the key breakout level from the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern comes in at 5,775. A minor 23.6% retracement of the advance lies at 5,770. Daily momentum traced out a mild bearish divergence at the closing high on June 12, and the momentum uptrend has been busted. The Vortex Indicator is close to a sell signal, while the 21-day SPX rate-of-change reading is close to going negative, which is also a sell signal. SPX volume has not logged a large uptick during recent down days, but we have seen a few above-average volume days on the Nasdaq 100, indicating some mild distribution.

      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock.

      "text": "On Monday\u2019s episode of Mad Money, host Jim Cramer warned viewers about how unchecked enthusiasm in the market can quickly become a serious danger.\n\u201cRemember, we have two markets going here, the normal one and the super speculative one that\u2019s made up of various cryptocurrencies and the stocks that back them\u2026 But of all the speculation we\u2019re seeing here, nothing repulses me more than the red-hot IPO market because when IPOs get too hot, they can lead to a bull market slaughterhouse.\u201d\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Commented on Magnificent Seven Stocks and Jim Cramer Spoke About These 18 Stocks.\nCramer pushed back on the idea that soaring prices should be embraced just because people are making money in the short term. He reminded viewers of the painful lessons from the past, asking:\n\u201cDon\u2019t we wish the dot-com bubble hadn\u2019t happened? Don\u2019t we wish the 2022 meltdown hadn\u2019t happened? It was stuff like this that drove it. The syndicate desks were clueless to what was really happening.\u201d\nCramer acknowledged that these desks cannot completely control speculation, but argued they should be able to recognize when first-day price spikes signal that market dynamics have changed. He went on to say that syndicate desks should not encourage gamblers or act helpless in the face of irrational demand. He warned that that kind of passivity is not what long-term investors need. He noted that the goal should be investing for actual returns, not chasing hype.\n\u201cThe Circles, the Figmas, the crypto stocks, they\u2019re all what\u2019s wrong with the market, not what\u2019s right. The syndicate desks, who do the pricing, need to know that once there\u2019s more wrong than right, this bull will turn into a bear, and their earnings at their companies will go up in smoke.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episodes of Mad Money aired on August 4. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the first quarter of 2025, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n14 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar\n14. Circle Internet Group (NYSE:CRCL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: N/A\nCircle Internet Group (NYSE:CRCL) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s radar. Cramer discussed the company\u2019s price movement after its IPO during the episode, as he said:\n\u201cNext up, the larger deal was Circle Internet Group. The IPO market was starting to heat up\u2026 by the time Circle came public in early June. But even though Circle upsized its deal significantly and raised its offer price range and then still priced well above the high end of the range, it wasn\u2019t ambitious enough. Deal priced at 31, but the stock opened for trading at 69. Within three weeks, it was nearly at 300. It\u2019s since cooled off around, they\u2019ve come down to 165, but that\u2019s still probably way too high. I think winners from CoreWeave rolled their take into Circle and turned it into a meme stock.\u201d\nCircle Internet (NYSE:CRCL) operates a platform for stablecoin and blockchain applications, as it provides U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins and related financial infrastructure.\n13. CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 36\nCoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s radar. Cramer said that he is a \u201chuge fan\u201d of the business but finds the stock \u201cpretty expensive.\u201d He stated:\n\u201cRight now, IPOs have become the new meme stocks, and the investment banks doing the offerings don\u2019t seem to know it. The meme trend began with CoreWeave, which came public at 40, incredibly small float or amount that was offered for trading. The underwriters\u2019 anxious for the deal to work. Prices on the whole are way lower than they thought they, they would have to do, and then they downsized the offering, selling just 37.5 million shares, raising just 1.5 billion. They originally hoped for something that\u2019s a billion dollars more than that. Now, CoreWeave is worth over 50 billion. The stock was initially driven up by memesters, who knew there was no new supply, so they just kept buying and buying and buying. How do I know this? Because it\u2019s a pattern that I\u2019ve seen since 1998. I recognize it. CoreWeave, a data center company, was simply very easy to take up because there wasn\u2019t much supply, especially after the deal was downsized. I\u2019m a huge fan of the business, but the stock\u2019s pretty expensive.\u201d\nCoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) provides a cloud platform optimized for generative AI that provides GPU and CPU compute, storage, networking, and managed services. The company supports workloads like model training, AI inference, and rendering, and includes tools for infrastructure management and dataset optimization."

      "text": "David Grain, Founder & CEO of Grain Management, joined CNBC on May 1 to discuss the AI-driven demand for data centers and tariff uncertainty. The main concerns regarding tariffs are the potential impact on costs, the resilience of supply chains, and the overall effect on business operations and their expansion. He also shared his perspective on why investors are still confident in the broadband and digital infrastructure sector. He characterized broadband as universally essential and emphasised that the demand for faster connectivity has not slowed, which is why the regulatory support for broadband expansion is globally robust. Grain noted that the administration has also met expectations for lighter regulation in the infrastructure sector, which makes it easier to advance projects and close deals. He described the admin\u2019s stance as pro-growth and supportive of secure and competitive networks. Grain also observed that infrastructure, especially broadband, is an area where there is bipartisan support, given its positive impact on economic growth at both the state and local levels.\nDeepSeek\u2019s announcement was also followed by reports that suggested that some companies might be pulling back on data center spending. However, the latest earnings reports appeared to settle at least this debate and confirmed that the investments in this sector were still ongoing. David Grain elaborated on the current trends in data center investments and also stated that the demand for data centers is rising due to the increasing expansion of AI, as it requires vast amounts of computing power. He explained that while the demand here is not slowing, the feasibility of building new data centers is still influenced by the availability of reliable and high-capacity electricity.\nThat being said, we\u2019re here with a list of the 11 hidden AI stocks to buy right now.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through financial media reports to compile a list of the top hidden AI stocks with AI-related operations and opportunities. We then selected the 11 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Sterling Infrastructure Inc. (NASDAQ:STRL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 28\nSterling Infrastructure Inc. (NASDAQ:STRL) provides e-infrastructure, transportation, and building solutions in the US and operates through three segments. It also constructs and develops data centers, which are essential for supporting the rapidly surging AI workloads. The company was formerly known as Sterling Construction Company Inc. until June 2022.\nIn Q4 2024, Sterling Construction\u2019s e-infrastructure revenue increased by 8% year-over-year. This was due to growth in the data center market, the revenue for which increased by more than 50%. The e-infrastructure backlog ended 2024 at over $1 billion, which was up 27%, with mission-critical work, such as data centers, which represent over 60% of the backlog. For 2025, Sterling Infrastructure Inc. (NASDAQ:STRL) expects strong e-infrastructure revenue growth above 10%.\nThe stock is down so far in 2025 due to the general slowdown of hype surrounding AI and data centers. However, on February 26, DA Davidson analyst Brent Thielman upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $185. The firm stated that the recent share pullback is a good buying opportunity.\nNCG Small Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. (NASDAQ:STRL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cSterling Infrastructure, Inc. (NASDAQ:STRL) is a construction and infrastructure services provider for the buildout of data centers, manufacturing facilities, warehouses, transportation, and residential and commercial buildings. Over the years, the company improved their financial performance by shifting focus to higher growth end markets which allowed for better visibility and project economics. We believe revenue growth and margin expansion should continue as end market tailwinds persist.\u201d\n10. Samsara Inc. (NYSE:IOT)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 40\nSamsara Inc. (NYSE:IOT) provides solutions to connect physical operations data to its connected operations platform in the US and internationally. Its Connected Operations Platform includes the Data Platform, which ingests, aggregates, and enriches data from its IoT devices. The company also integrates AI into its data platform and video-based safety applications.\nSamsara\u2019s large operational data asset is crucial for its AI initiatives. It processes over 14 trillion data points annually. AI is now being applied across areas like predictive maintenance, real-time route adjustments, and automated driver safety. Samsara is developing and deploying Manhattan Assist features across its platform, which uses GenAI. The company also plans to preview more Agentic AI capabilities at its upcoming Beyond customer conference.\nFor the full fiscal year 2025, the company made $1.25 billion in revenue, which was up 33% year-over-year. The annual recurring revenue in the period totaled $1.46 billion, which was up 33%. Samsara Inc. (NYSE:IOT) highlights that AI has become 100 times less expensive in the last two years and is becoming increasingly accessible.

      "text": "On April 25, Kari Firestone, Aureus Asset Management executive chairman and co-founder, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 to discuss the latest market trends and express how this is a reasonable place for long-term investors to enter the market. Despite persistent concerns about a recession coming from tariffs, Firestone thinks that corporate earnings have generally exceeded expectations. The strong performance of major tech companies has been a key driver behind the market\u2019s recent gains, such as those in the MAG7. Elaborating on the significance of these tech giants, Firestone also underscored that the top 2 companies in the S&P 500, regardless of which they are, match the market value of the bottom 300 companies in the index. This concentration means that these leading firms are fundamental to the US economy\u2019s progress.\nThe conversation then addressed the impact of proposed FDA budget cuts on innovation for biotech companies. Firestone agreed that such cuts could slow down the approval process for new products and drug manufacturing, and she advised against reducing the FDA\u2019s budget. However, she believes that the market has already priced in these risks. She compared the situation to previous market overreactions, such as the 32% drop during the early COVID-19 period, which was followed by a rapid recovery.\nFirestone also concluded that the market is now fairly valued. Some sectors offer attractive opportunities due to recent price declines. She assessed the overall market valuation in light of tariff uncertainties and the recent rebound from a 20% drop to a current decline of about 10.5%. She explained that the market\u2019s price-to-earnings multiple has decreased from 22.5x next year\u2019s earnings to 18.5x, assuming no severe recession. She\u2019s confident that the market is unlikely to end the year lower than current levels and recommends that long-term investors enter the market at this stage. Firestone believes that the market has partially priced in the impact of tariffs. She estimated that a 5% to 10% tariff is reflected in current prices. While a full-blown recession may not be entirely priced in, a slowdown likely is.\nThat being said, we\u2019re here with a list of the 30 stocks that should double in 3 years.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through financial media reports and Reddit threads to compile a list of the top 30 stocks that should double in 3 years.
