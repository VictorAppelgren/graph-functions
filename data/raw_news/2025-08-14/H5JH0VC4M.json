  "title": "Wreckage found in Goodyear after pilot goes missing from Phoenix-area airport",
  "description": "The remnants of a private plane were found Aug. 13, 2025, but the pilot had not yet been identified.",
  "content": "Several agencies were investigating a crash scene in Goodyear after the wreckage of a previously missing plane was discovered.\n\nThe identity of the pilot was unknown due to the extent of the damage from the wreck, said spokesperson Sgt. Mayra Reeson with the Goodyear Police Department. It was found in the area of Ocotillo Road and Bullard Avenue around 6:30 p.m. on Aug. 13 by the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office Air Unit, according to Sheriff's Office spokesperson Calbert Gillett.\n\nGoodyear police was previously notified of a missing person case regarding the pilot around 11 a.m. on Aug. 12, Reeson said. According to the report, the person was last seen operating their private, single-engine plane that departed from the Phoenix Goodyear Airport. The Federal Aviation Administration issued an alert to local public safety agencies, pilots and airports about the missing airplane.\n\nThe plane wreckage found was of a Pitts S1-T airplane, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.\n\nOnly the pilot was on board, the FAA said in a statement. The Sheriff's Office has taken primary responsibility for the investigation and was coordinating with the NTSB, Gillett said.\n\nThe NTSB sent an investigator to the scene, according to spokesperson Peter Knudson.\n\nAfter the plane wreckage is documented, it will be moved to \"a secure facility for further evaluation,\" Knudson said.\n\nThe agency investigates three primary areas \u2014 the pilot, the aircraft and the operating environment, he said. That process will include gathering the flight track data, air traffic control recordings, plane maintenance records and other data, Knudson said.\n\nInvestigators will also look into the weather at the time of the crash and any available witness statements, according to Knudson. Anyone with information was encouraged to contact the NTSB at witness@ntsb.gov. A preliminary report was expected within the next 30 days, Knudson said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Crash site found in Goodyear after pilot reported missing",

It was found in the area of Ocotillo Road and Bullard Avenue around 6:30 p.m. on Aug. 13 by the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office Air Unit, according to Sheriff's Office spokesperson Calbert Gillett.\nGoodyear police was previously notified of a missing person case regarding the pilot around 11 a.m. on Aug. 12, Reeson said. According to the report, the person was last seen operating their private, single-engine plane that departed from the Phoenix Goodyear Airport. The Federal Aviation Administration issued an alert to local public safety agencies, pilots and airports about the missing airplane.\nThe plane wreckage found was of a Pitts S1-T airplane, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.\nOnly the pilot was on board, the FAA said in a statement. The Sheriff's Office has taken primary responsibility for the investigation and was coordinating with the NTSB, Gillett said.\nThe NTSB sent an investigator to the scene, according to spokesperson Peter Knudson.\nAfter the plane wreckage is documented, it will be moved to \"a secure facility for further evaluation,\" Knudson said.\nThe agency investigates three primary areas \u2014 the pilot, the aircraft and the operating environment, he said. That process will include gathering the flight track data, air traffic control recordings, plane maintenance records and other data, Knudson said.\nInvestigators will also look into the weather at the time of the crash and any available witness statements, according to Knudson. Anyone with information was encouraged to contact the NTSB at witness@ntsb.gov. A preliminary report was expected within the next 30 days, Knudson said."
