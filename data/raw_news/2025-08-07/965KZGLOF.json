AppSignal now offers native support for OpenTelemetry, enabling monitoring capabilities for Go, Java, and PHP applications alongside existing Ruby, Elixir, and Node.js support.\n\nWith simple pricing and support for Go, Java, and PHP applications, AppSignal transforms its customers\u2019 OTel data into actionable insights in less than five minutes so they can effectively monitor applications, boost performance and explore trends with zero custom integration work. AppSignal\u2019s latest OTel integration provides simple instrumentation, error tracking, and performance monitoring for these languages through a single, unified platform. Development and engineering teams can leverage the industry-standard OTel protocol to collect telemetry data while AppSignal transforms it into actionable insights with pre-built visualization dashboards, intelligent alerting, and the simplicity SMBs need, without vendor lock-in.\n\u2022 Automatic instrumentation and instant support for Go (Gin, Echo), Java (Spring Boot), and PHP (Laravel, Symfony)\n\u2022 Zero-configuration OTel collector integration and unified monitoring across all languages - Ruby, Elixir, Node.js, Go, Java, and PHP\n\u2022 Smart sampling that captures 100 percent of errors and triggers anomaly detection while managing data volume\n\u2022 Zero vendor lock-in so OTel instrumentation works with any compatible platform\n\n\n\n\u201cCurrent OpenTelemetry tools typically overwhelm developers by dumping raw metrics, logs, and traces with little context. We took a different approach by adopting OTel rather than building proprietary language integrations,\u201d noted Wes Oudshoorn, chief product officer, AppSignal. \u201cAppSignal translates OTel data into clear insights, showing developers exactly what is broken or slow without requiring them to piece it together themselves. Now offering first-class support for PHP, Java, and Go through our OTel implementation, AppSignal also accepts any OTel data, enabling full-stack observability for virtually any setup. To simplify onboarding, we provide a hosted collector, so developers do not need to run their own. We are excited to welcome new programming communities to AppSignal and deliver the experience they expect from a modern observability platform.\u201d",
