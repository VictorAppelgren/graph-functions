  "description": "Scammers are using AI to break hearts and bank accounts at the same time.",
  "content": "As if the proliferation and sophistication of scams on the internet weren't already enough, AI technologies are already making them more common, and harder to spot. Old scams can now be automated en masse, and entirely new scams are possible thanks to the latest AI tech.\n\nNow, you can add AI-powered \"catfishing\" to the list, as scammers employ AI to break hearts and bank accounts at the same time.\n\nCatfishing Has Always Been Dangerous\n\nThe most effective scams have always been the ones that target strong human emotions. If you appeal to someone's greed, loneliness, or lust, there's a good chance you'll diminish their critical thinking capacity, and make it easier to get compliance from them that seems irrational to outsiders.\n\nThat's why catfishing has always been both one of the cruelest and most effective forms of online fraud. In a catfishing scam, you meet someone online and form an emotional relationship with them. Only later, will it turn out that this person never existed. It's someone pretending to be this person, fooling you into having real feelings for a fake person.\n\nMore often than not, this is a romantic relationship made with the aim of getting money from you, but some scammers do it just for fun or for some form of wish fulfillment. It's not always a romantic type of relationship either. It can be anything from a new friendship to a new business partner that's just made up from someone's imagination.\n\nNow AI Has Perfected It\n\nCatfishing's only real limitation is that it's not easy to pull off. The scammer needs to put in a lot of time and effort to make it work, and often spends months on their mark before extorting them. It takes just a single slip-up for the scammer to be exposed, and a common way to expose a catfish is to insist on, for example, a live video call.\n\nUnfortunately, several AI tools and technologies now make it easy for this scam to be rolled out on a larger scale. AI video is easy to generate, and with the advent of technology like Google's VEO 3, we can automatically generate audio to go with that video. You can use that technology to make hilarious Bigfoot videos or you can use it to create fake people to scam hapless internet users.\n\nYou can also do real-time facial deep fakes with AI-powered voice changing to fake being someone else on a live video call.\n\nDoing just the voice-changing bit is so easy these days anyone can do it, so if you can limit yourself to voice calls, you can really scam people to your heart's content, and you don't even have to do it yourself. Just employ a suitably-trained chatbot to speak to your victims in real time.\n\nThe only thing you need is the software and the computer equipment to make it feasible, and you could be sitting back while your army of fake AI people spend months worming their way into the hearts of humans who just have no idea.\n\nYou Need to Talk to Vulnerable Family and Friends\n\nJust like I advised with AI voice cloning scams in general, the most important weapon here is to be aware that the technology exists. Many people who fall for these scams didn't know it was possible to fake an entire person's online life with realistic video, photos, and live interaction. If you don't know it's possible, why would you ever stop to think things are a little suspicious? The fact is that for a lot of people, their online street smarts are simply out of date.\n\nTalk to your parents, your children, your friends, or anyone in your life that doesn't follow the latest tech news. No one is safe from AI-powered scams, and to be fore-warned is to be fore-armed, as the saying goes.\n\nWhile AI catfishing can strike in any walk of life, I think online dating is probably one of the most important places to take special precautions. These dating apps are an extremely popular way to look for romantic partners these days, but some people may take a long time to move from the online phase to the in-person meeting phase. Indeed, if you swipe right on someone that lives too far away to actually progress beyond online, then you're in real danger of being catfished.\n\nThey might want to move you to another platform (like Whatsapp or another encrypted app) as soon as possible, and then the work of getting their virtual claws in can begin. So my only real advice is to limit yourself to people where meeting in person can happen, and try to facilitate that sooner rather than later\u2014keeping all the other normal online dating safety precautions on mind!",

      "text": "Summary\n- Voice cloning scams are on the rise and can tap into our emotions to make us act irrationally. Beware and stay alert.\n- Signs of a voice cloning scam include inconsistencies in vocal cadence, urgency, and unfamiliar phone numbers.\n- Protect yourself by creating a safe phrase with loved ones, taking time to think before taking immediate action, and verifying information independently.\nCloning someone's voice using AI is now easy enough even scammers can do it. People are already being victimized by this abuse of AI technology, but you don't have to be the next person to fall for the scam. Here's how you can beat them before they get you.\nHow Voice Cloning Scams Work\nImagine getting a phone call from a family member. It's 3AM, they've been in an accident, they've been arrested, they need money to post bail. You get passed to his \"lawyer\" and are asked to wire money. This is what happened to attorney Gary Schildhorn. What about getting a call from your daughter, claiming that she's been kidnapped, but she's asleep in bed. That happened to Jennifer DeStefano, and could have ended much worse if the scammers had timed things differently.\nBy misusing AI software tools that can create voice profiles from, for example, videos someone might leave on social media, scammers can tap into our emotions to make us behave irrationally. This is already happening and will only increase in sophistication, so there's no better time to arm yourself with knowledge and strategies to combat this.\nSigns That You're Being Scammed\nWhile it can be hard to tell the difference between a cloned voice and the real thing, there are a few signs that might tip you off that something isn't right:\n- The vocal cadence, pronunciation, vocabulary, and style aren't quite right. Sure, people can sound different in an emergency, but try to pay attention to the finer details of their speech, and it might tip you off.\n- The scammer will try to spend as little time as possible speaking with you, likely handing you off to a stranger so that you won't catch on.\n- There's a massive sense of urgency, even when there doesn't need to be. Scammers aren't likely to use a true emergency as a pretense, since that doesn't fit their needs.\n- The phone number is unfamiliar, although numbers can be spoofed of course.\nThe most important thing is to be aware that such scams are possible, and to have healthy skepticism when you're confronted by these types of semi-emergency scenarios.\nDecide on a Safe Phrase With Family and Friends\nThe scammers have done some research on the information that's publicly available about you and the person they are impersonating. However, if you take the time to come up with a safe word or a phrase that's only known to you and your loved ones, then you can confirm you're speaking to the real person. This phrase must never be written down or sent over the internet.\nThen, if you ever receive an emergency call, you can just ask for the safe word and unless the scammer can somehow guess it, you'll stop the whole scam in its tracks.\nStop to Think\nA hallmark of scams, both old and new, is to stop you from having time to think. The less time we have to make decisions, the worse our decisions tend to be. They don't want you thinking too much or you might notice gaps in the story or realize you're being asked to do unreasonable or illogical things. So, once you're off the phone, take five minutes and just think about everything that's been said. Does it really all make sense?\nGet Third-Party Information Verification\nFinally, the easiest way to expose one of these scams is to take control over where your information is coming from. Have you only been speaking to people who have phoned you? Phone the person who supposedly called you. Phone someone close to them. Message them, do anything using a communication channel the scammers have no control over. You can figure out if something has really happened in seconds just by taking a minute to do your own investigations.\nThe most powerful weapon against scams like these are the simple knowledge that they exist. After all, if you didn't know this was possible, how could you defend against it. Now you do know, so there's no reason to fall for that trick we first saw in the Terminator movies."

      "text": "Quick Links\nHave you ever talked to someone online, and then found out that they were lying about who they were? Then you might have been catfished. The term is often applied to fraudulent romantic relationships, but it isn't always about romance.\nTable of Contents\n- What Is Catfishing?\n- Why Do People Catfish?\n- How Catfishing Happens\n- Why Is It Named After a Catfish?\n- \"I'm Going to Catfish\"\nWhat Is Catfishing?\nCatfishing is the act of deceiving another person online with a fake account, identity, photos, and other details about their life. It is most commonly found on social networking sites and dating sites. A \"catfish\" refers to the person performing the deception.\nBecause of the widespread popularity of the term, catfishing has also become synonymous with simple acts of misrepresentation or deception.\nWhy Do People Catfish?\nThe most common reason to catfish someone is for wish fulfillment. In these types of relationships, the catfish and the person they catfish will form an emotional connection with each other over the internet, even forming committed relationships and partnerships without ever actually seeing the other person.\nCatfishing does not necessarily have to be romantic, either. There are many examples of being catfished by prospective friends or business partners. The scam ends when one person discovers the extent of the catfish's deception, typically upon being prompted by other people in their life, such as friends and family, to investigate further.\nAn even darker side to catfishing is those who scam others for monetary gain. The catfisher will pose as someone in need of help for something like a family emergency or medical expenses, then solicit others for money. A common type of scam involves asking someone for money to fly so that they can meet up, and then ghosting them afterward.\nLastly, catfishing is sometimes used for good. There are cases of people, including law enforcement, using catfish accounts in order to catch criminals or predators in the act.\nHow Catfishing Happens\nThere are always two people in relationships that involve catfishing: the \"catfish\" who lies about their name, age, gender, identity, appearance, and various personal details, and the \"catfished\" person that believes all of these things and forms a relationship built entirely on lies.\nTypically, the catfish will set up social media accounts posing as someone else, either by creating a fake identity or by using another person's information. They will collect various photos to display, litter their profile with fake details, and craft various stories about themselves.\nThey will begin to form a relationship with someone else while posing as their fake identity. A common thread among catfish is that they will make up various scenarios to get the other person emotionally involved. Catfish also actively try to prevent meeting with their partners, completely refusing to do video calls and in-person meetups.\nWhy Is It Named After a Catfish?\nIn 2010, filmmakers Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman released their documentary Catfish, about a man named Nev who starts a relationship with a woman, Angela, who was posing as someone named Megan. The film is credited with coining the term and starting the entire cultural conversation about catfishing. It was later spun-off into the hit MTV show, \"Catfish: The TV Show.\"\nThe term itself refers to a method that fishermen used to keep cod intact when they shipped the fish long distances. Catfish were placed in the tank to keep the cod active, which preserved the quality of the fish. Therefore, it is said that people who \"catfish\" are there to make the lives of other people more exciting.\n\"I'm Going to Catfish\"\nThanks to the movie and the eventual TV show, \"catfishing\" has become a cultural phenomenon all on its own. However, aside from its dark, original definition of someone fooling others with entirely fake identities and photos, it has also taken on a slightly more innocent meaning.\nA \"catfish\" can be used to refer to anyone who uses slightly altered information on an online dating profile or a filter on their photos, often to make themselves look better. For example, you might say you're \"catfishing\" someone if you put an age that's two years older than you really are. You could even say that you're \"catfishing\" if you were whitening your teeth in a photo editor.\nThe term has become synonymous with changing your personal information in any way. Even putting a slightly misleading profile picture of yourself may be considered catfishing by some. When it comes to forming relationships with other people, even online, building trust is essential. Therefore, we don't suggest obfuscating yourself unless it's for privacy reasons."

      "text": "Summary\n- On most dating apps, \"Swipe left\" means reject, and \"swipe right\" means like.\n- Swiping \"Right\" involves swiping from left to right or pushing an on-screen image to the right.\n- Dating app terms like \"swiping,\" \"match,\" and \"super like\" are popular slang in real life and memes.\n\"Swipe right\" and \"swipe left\" are essential phrases in online dating. As a result, they've been making their way to all corners on the internet\u2014and beyond. Here's what these phrases mean and where they come from.\nSwipe Left, Swipe Right\nIf you've been on the internet lately, there's a good chance you've seen a meme or a post that uses the term \"swipe left\" or \"swipe right.\" These two terms come from Tinder, the most popular online dating app around the world.\n\"Swipe right\" means to like or accept someone, while \"swipe left\" means to reject them. The meaning of these two phrases is taken from one of Tinder's core mechanics. When a person sees a profile on their Tinder feed, they can either swipe right to show their interest or swipe left if they're uninterested. If both people swipe right on each other, they'll be matched up and can start messaging.\nIt's common for two people not to match even if one of them swipes right. Creating a match requires mutual interest from both parties. If you don't end up matching with someone you swiped right on, you can just assume that they swiped left on you.\nHow Dating Apps Work\nAlthough Tinder was the service that popularized \"swipe right\" and \"swipe left,\" most modern dating apps use some variation of the \"swipe right\" and \"swipe left.\" Other very popular dating apps that use similar mechanics include Bumble and Coffee Meets Bagel.\nMost of these dating apps follow a straightforward premise: Upload several photos of yourself along with a description, some interests, and personal information. You will then see profiles within your preferred age range, distance, and gender. If you and a potential partner both \"swipe right\" on each other, you will have a match. Users can usually unmatch someone later.\nFrom that point on, you can freely talk to each other, both inside and outside the app. Some apps, like Bumble, also have a timeout feature, where the match expires if someone does not make a move. Many apps also have premium features that include seeing everyone who swiped right on you.\nThe popularity of dating apps has made online dating the de facto way of meeting people for many. As a result, many aspects of this experience have made their way into pop culture.\n\"Swiping\" in Real Life and Memes\nBecause online dating culture has become so ubiquitous and widespread on the internet and in real life, the terms involved have also become commonplace. The terms \"swipe right\" and \"swipe left\" have become ways for people to identify whether or not they're interested in something or someone.\nYou might also encounter these terms in memes or funny tweets on social media. Usually, \"swiping left\" on something means showing your displeasure with it.\nHere are a few examples of online dating slang being used in real-life conversations or memes:\n- I'd swipe left on that cake. Too many carbs!\n- I'd definitely swipe right on him!\n- So how are you feeling about your relationship? Swipe left or swipe right?\nOther Online Dating Slang\nAside from swiping left and swiping right, there are a few other terms from online dating culture that have become popular memes and slang words on the internet. Here are some of the ones that you should know:\n- Match: A pair of people who have expressed mutual interest in each other on a dating app. Matches are allowed to send each other messages.\n- Super Like/Swipe up: This is a term derived from Tinder's \"super like\" feature, which allows you to highlight your profile to a user that you're very interested in. When used outside Tinder, it means that you really like something.\n- Ghosting: This means to stop replying to someone altogether. This is a reasonably popular term even outside of dating and can apply to all kinds of scenarios.\n- Catfishing: A term established in the earliest days of online dating, which means to use fake photos of yourself to gain more matches and meet more people.\n- Breadcrumbing: This means talking to someone in a non-committal manner, which could leave them hanging and waiting for a confirmation.\nIf you want to learn more about popular online slang, then you might want to check our breakdowns of other acronyms like NSFW and AMA, or POV and DM."

      "text": "It used to be that if you wanted to make a half-decent Bigfoot video, you needed to spend a lot of time making a suit, and then walk around the local forests while your friend films you, hoping that no hunters mistake you for a bear.\nThese days, with AI video, you can make your own Bigfoot videos\u2014or anything else! Which is why we're seeing an explosion in creative ideas, including a new AI video trend that has finally made me laugh: Bigfoot vlogs.\nAI Video Generation Has Reached New Heights\nWhile AI-generated video has been around for some time now, it's only recently with the release of Google's Veo 3 that it's really become truly useful. This cutting-edge video generator isn't just notable for having really impressive visual results, but also for generating the audio for the video.\nThat includes music, foley, and the voices of characters. Perfectly synced to lip movement. The characters don't have to be human either, which is good news if you want to generate an image of a Bigfoot talking into his GoPro.\nGoogle's Veo 3 Video Generator Could Turn Kickstarter Into a Minefield\nWe're in for some wild times.\nPeople Are Experimenting With Ideas Like Never Before\nWhile it's not exactly cheap to generate these videos, it seems many people have dug out their credit cards to experiment with Veo 3. If you're a Gemini Pro subscriber, you can now create three Veo 3 videos with sound every day using the Veo 3 (Fast) model in Gemini Pro. You can also use the Google Flow tool to generate and edit videos using either the fast or regular model, at a cost of 20 or 100 AI credits per video, depending on whether you use the fast or more intensive model. The video I generated above was made using the fast model, which doesn't have the same visual quality, but we still get the sound generation.\nThis has certainly led to a flood of videos with sounds and other audio on the internet. One of the things that sets Veo 3 apart is that you can provide source material using the Flow editor. This means you can have a consistent character, or a consistent look and feel to your clips. It also means you can trim clips and regenerate just the parts that didn't come out right. That's a powerful improvement over how AI video generation worked before.\nCritics Think AI Video Can Never Be Funny or Creative\nComedy is hard, and so much relies on the timing and delivery to be funny. It's true that the \"acting\" we see from characters generated by Veo 3 is pretty stilted, especially when something's meant to be dramatic or heartfelt. It feels very phoned-in right now.\nHowever, some people have figured out that you can work around that. By using the right context or through clever editing, it's possible to make these videos genuinely funny. Add to that, the current way people consume very short video clips like YouTube Shorts or Instagram Reels is perfect for these shorter AI-generated\nSometimes these videos are funny because of the AI-generated weirdness that creeps in, but it takes a human being with a real human sense of humor to shape the AI output into something that will get a chuckle from an audience.\nBigfoot Vlogs Are Showing Preconceptions About AI Video Are Dead Wrong\nWhich brings us to the whole Bigfoot vlog phenomenon. The idea of making AI videos showing what it would be like if Bigfoot (or a yeti) got a hold of some camera equipment and made little vlog-style recordings is simple on paper. However, whoever is making these is really putting some thought into it, which is a huge part of why it works.\nThere's a distinct personality to these cryptids. The best example are Bigfoot Vlog and perhaps best of all\u2014Big Yowie. Just be warned, some of the videos can be mildly-graphic. Like PG-13 at worst.\nIt's not perfect, but it's already viable as a way to create entertaining content. Perhaps most importantly, if you read the comments on these videos, people are saying how this is the first time that an AI-generated video has actually made them laugh. The channels are doing well, and it's obvious the creator is getting more dialed in as you go from the oldest to the latest clips.\nThe downside of this new technology in the hands of anyone with a working credit card, is that we're seeing lots of not-so-good content. Because, of course, no matter how good the AI-generation technology is, that doesn't help someone with no sense of humor or creativity to make something anyone else would want to watch, let alone laugh at."
