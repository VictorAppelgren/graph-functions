  "description": "Sony\u2019s latest console has the PS3 in its sights, but matching PS4 sales is still a long way off.",
  "content": "The PS5 might be lacking the cadence of first-party exclusives that made its predecessor so successful, but that doesn\u2019t appear to be slowing it down. Sony has announced that the console had shifted just north of 80 million units as of June 30, 2025. This puts it just behind the Xbox 360 (84 million) and well on the way to overtaking the PS3 (around 87 million) in lifetime sales.\n\nThe 80.3 million figure was confirmed in Sony\u2019s first set of for the current financial year, during which time it sold 2.5 million PS5s, a slight downturn from 2.8 million in the previous quarter. Compared to the same period in the last financial year, however, the company has actually shifted around 100,000 more consoles in the last three months.\n\nSony also sold approximately 66 million PS4 and PS5 games this quarter, almost 7 million of which were first-party titles. That\u2019s around a 12 million year-on-year increase in overall software sales. Digital accounted for 83 percent of PS4 and PS5 games sold in the last quarter, which is a larger share than in any three-month period in the previous financial year.\n\nThe last few years saw Sony briefly shift its focus towards live service games, but one of those was a well-documented , and have been cancelled. Clearly none of that has noticeably hurt software sales, though, as Sony has continued to grow in that area.\n\nThe PS5 turns five this November, and attention will then turn to whether it will hit the all-important 100 million mark in its lifetime. The PS4 in five years and seven months, and at the time it was the fastest console to reach that number. It also didn\u2019t have to contend with tariffs. PS5 prices in the UK, Australia and New Zealand earlier this year, with Sony blaming a \u201cchallenging economic environment\u201d in which it is fighting against high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates. The company has since said it is moving PS5 manufacturing to the US in the future.",

      "text": "Sony has sold 100 million PlayStation 4 consoles\nThings are slowing down more than it expected, though.\nDespite flagging sales of late, Sony's PlayStation 4 has sold 100 million units, making it the fastest-selling console to hit that number. In its latest earnings report, Sony revealed that it sold 3.2 million PS4s between March 31st and June 30th, after announcing last quarter that it had sold a total of 96.8 million units since the console came out. That means it hit the 100 million figure on the nose in 5 years and seven months, just two months quicker than Nintendo's Wii.\nSony also revealed that for the first time, folks are buying more games via digital downloads than physical discs, marking a trend that's been ongoing for a while now.\nDespite its half-decade age, PS4 sales have never really flagged until recently, with 17.8 million sold last year, down just 1.2 million over 2017. However, it took a noticeable dive last quarter, and Sony has warned that it expects 2019 sales to be down more than it originally forecast last quarter. A slow demise in PS4 sales is to be expected, though, considering that Sony's next-gen PS5 should arrive in fall of 2020, with support for ray-tracing 8K, SSD storage and PS4 backward-compatibility.\nIn other Sony news, smartphone revenue dropped by 15 percent over last quarter, continuing what seems like a never-ending trend. It sold less than half the number of smartphones it did during the same period last year, just 900,000 in total. To give you an idea of how bad that is, total units sold in 2018 was less than half of 2017, and so far, 2019 is half of 2018.\nMeanwhile, Sony's imaging division continues to perform well, particularly in the area of smartphone camera sensors. Sales of digital cameras like its full-frame A7 mirrorless cameras were down slightly, but that's a trend that's affecting the industry as a whole (because of increasingly more sophisticated smartphone cameras, of course). Sony is still one of the most profitable camera companies out there, though, so that's not a good sign for the industry as a whole."

      "text": "Presenting Sony\u2019s latest financial report to investors on Wednesday, executives at the company were inevitably asked about the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on the business, and how they were going to respond. They had a number of different answers, including raising prices \u2014 and, incredibly, they did not dismiss the idea of manufacturing PlayStation 5 in the U.S. out of hand.\n\u201cGaming consoles [\u2026] can be produced locally. I think that would be an efficient strategy,\u201d said Sony\u2019s president and CEO Hiroki Totoki. \u201cWhether [PS5] is going to be manufactured in the U.S. or not needs to be considered.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a remarkable statement, since it would likely take years and serious investment for Sony to create manufacturing capability for PS5 in America. But Totoki\u2019s words are a sign that in the current unpredictable situation, nothing is off the table, and no ideas are bad ideas.\nA more expected move might be to raise prices, and Sony admitted this was also a possibility, albeit in the vaguest possible terms. Chief financial officer Lin Tao said Sony was looking at a financial impact of 100 billion yen (about $684 million) from tariffs across its divisions. \u201cWe may pass on to the price,\u201d she said, without singling out PS5 in particular. But she also said Sony was taking different measures, like shipment allocations, to mitigate the impact of tariffs.\nCase in point: Tao said that Sony has a stockpile of PS5 consoles in the U.S. that should last for three months. This will allow it to wait out the situation for a while and see what happens, and may mean that a PS5 price increase is still months away, if it\u2019s coming at all.\nThe PS5 is largely manufactured in China, which the Trump administration has subjected to higher tariffs than most other countries. This week, in a temporary de-escalation, the U.S. reduced its tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for the next 90 days. That\u2019s encouraging news, but it also highlights the unpredictability of the situation \u2014 which is what has electronics manufacturers like Sony and Nintendo scrambling for answers. On Tuesday, Nintendo essentially said that it would take a hit on tariffs rather than raising prices as it usually would, because it was in the launch year for the Switch 2 and didn\u2019t want to slow down the new console\u2019s momentum.\nIn summary: Company executives are as clueless about what\u2019s going on as the rest of us and are mostly heading steady and hoping for the best. As analyst Mat Piscatella put it on Bluesky: \u201cBig takeaway from latest video game earnings statements around the tariff situation is that a) no one is confident in predicting what will happen next b) folks are carrying multiple scenario plans, but trying to stay the course if possible c) everyone is hoping it all just goes away.\u201d\nWell, we can all relate to that."

Sony has announced a series of price hikes for the PS5, blaming \"a backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates.\" The company last raised PS5 prices across these markets in 2022.\nOnly the PS5 Digital Edition's cost changes in Europe and the UK. It will increase to \u20ac500 ($570) from \u20ac450 ($513) in Europe and to \u00a3430 ($567) from \u00a3390 ($514) in the UK.\nPrices for the Digital Edition and PS5 with disc drive are rising significantly across the board. The Digital Edition is increasing to AUD $750 (USD $475) from AUD $650 (USD $412) in Australia. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, the PS5 with disc drive is now NZD $950 (USD $558), up from NZD $900. Those new prices go into effect immediately, so hopefully, you did some shopping over the weekend if you wanted a new PS5.\nIn contrast, Sony is reducing the cost of purchasing the add-on disc drive. Buyers will pay \u20ac80 in Europe (down from \u20ac120) and \u00a370 in the UK, down from \u00a3100."

      "text": "Naughty Dog cancels development on The Last of Us Online\nThe developer has chosen to focus on single-player narrative games.\nAlas, The Last of Us Online will never see the light of day. Naughty Dog has announced that it has \"made the incredibly difficult decision to stop\" its development. It explains that the online team had a clear vision of the project and had already refined its gameplay. However, it soon became clear when the company was ramping the game up to full production that it was going to bite off more than it can chew. If it releases an online game, it has to dedicate all its resources to supporting post launch content in the future. That means becoming a studio that exclusively offers live gaming services \u2014 one with no capacity to release more single-player narrative games like the original The Last of Us titles.\nThe studio first gave us a peek at concept art from the project in 2022, but it offered very little in terms of updates since. After the PlayStation Showcase in May, it admitted that it knows fans of the franchise are looking forward to hearing more about the game but that it realized that it needed more time to work on it and couldn't share details just yet. Bloomberg reported shortly after that, though, that the studio had already reassigned developers working on the project to other teams and was reconsidering its viability. Clearly, Naughty Dog has decided its path, and it doesn't lead to the release of an online title. The developer says it has \"more than one ambitious, brand new single player game\" in the works and will be sharing what's next when it's ready."

      "text": "Sony pulls the plug on Concord and shuts down Firewalk Studios\nAnother game studio gone.\nSony has officially killed off Concord and is shuttering the studio behind the game. Concord's servers were taken down just two weeks after the launch of the competitive team shooter from Firewalk Studios after poor sales. Firewalk's game director Ryan Ellis chose to move himself into a more supportive role following Concord's struggles, and Sony had said it would consider its options for the project. The decision is in.\n\"After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio,\" Hermen Hulst of Sony Interactive Entertainment's Studio Business Group said in a statement today. \"I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication.\" A representative told Bloomberg News that Firewalk Studios had 172 employees who will lose their jobs.\nThe online game business is brutal, and Concord may have suffered for its long development time, which meant other team shooters had already risen to prominence and defined players' expectations. Many similar games are free to play and support themselves financially with a battle pass or seasonal model. Gamers may have balked at the $40 price tag for a new property, or maybe the genre was simply too crowded for Concord to muscle in.\nWhatever the reasons, today's news marks another difficult chapter for the game development world. Firewalk Studios is an outlier for having this level of commercial failure, but it's still yet another closure in the industry that has seen a lot of turbulence in recent years. Layoffs and shutdowns have been a top story in gaming, but several of the recent cases have been like Firewalk, which was acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment just last spring. Netflix abruptly shut down its AAA studio last week before the team had even announced a project. Microsoft closed three studios from the Zenimax family earlier this year. As fewer parties control a growing share of the games industry, the tolerance for experimentation and slim profit margins will likely shrink too. And this type of sudden upheaval could become all the more common.\nUpdate, October 29, 2024, 2:52PM ET: Story updated with additional context about Concord, Firewalk Studios' staff numbers and broader studio closure trends."

Neither studio will be closed, though the company has yet to say if any layoffs will occur. \"We are working closely with each studio to determine what are the next projects,\" a spokesperson said.\nBluepoint is the studio that created the much-lauded remakes of Demon\u2019s Souls and Shadow of the Colossus. The company reportedly helped with God of War Ragnarok from between 2020 and 2022, and following that, was working on the live-service project canceled yesterday, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier said in a post on BlueSky. Bend Studio has been a first-party developer for Sony since 2000, with its most recent project being the action-adventure game Days Gone, released for PS4 in 2019.\nThe cancelations are the latest failures for Sony in the GaaS (games as a service) arena, following the spectacular flameout of Concord in September 2024. While the company did have a hit with Helldivers II last year, it reportedly canceled several other live-service games in the last several years, including one based on Spider-Man. Sony Interactive Entertainment cut around 1,120 jobs in 2024 across various studios, including Bungie, Naughty Dog and Insomniac \u2014 part of an unfortunate trend in the industry."
