(Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nWe know, we know. You were probably just getting used to calling it HBO Max again.\n\nBut here comes the streaming world\u2019s most tumultuous service with another huge change. This time, they\u2019re coming for password sharing.\n\nIn a quarterly earnings call, JB Perrette, the head of streaming and gaming at Warner Bros. Discovery, announced that the company would be taking a more aggressive tack in dealing with password sharing. Perrette said the initiative would target \u201cwho\u2019s a legitimate user who may not be a legitimate user.\u201d\n\nWhat this means is that the service will be monitoring information like device IDs and IP addresses to determine when an account is being shared outside the boundaries of one\u2019s household. When the service uncovers instances of this, it will prompt those outside to pay an additional $7.99 per month to be added as an extra member.\n\nNetflix kickstarted this crackdown trend back in 2023. Other services, like Disney Plus, have followed suit. With all of these massive corporations finding new ways to squeeze every dime out of consumers they possibly can, we find it\u2019s best to bundle as many of these services together as possible.\n\nThe HBO Max/Disney Plus/Hulu bundle is perhaps the best example of this. For only $16.99 per month, you get all three services at a 42% savings.\n\nHBO Max by itself is normally $16.99, so at least when you sign up for the bundle, you\u2019re getting three services for the price of one. It doesn\u2019t let you password share, but it does grant you access to thousands of hours of TV shows and movies at a pretty reasonable price.\n\nWe have no idea how long this bundle will last, so sign up now while you can.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

      "text": "HBO Max\u2019s password-sharing crackdown is about to get stricter. During an earnings call on Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery streaming head JB Perette said prompts surrounding account sharing will become more persistent starting next month, pushing people toward paying an extra $7.99 per month to add an extra member to their account.\n\u201cIn September, you\u2019ll actually start to see the messaging \u2014 which right now has been a fairly soft, cancelable messaging \u2014 start to get more fixed and such that people have to take action,\u201d Perette said, adding that right now, paid sharing is \u201ca voluntary process.\u201d\nFollowing password-sharing crackdowns at Netflix and Disney Plus, Warner Bros. Discovery announced its own plan to introduce paid sharing last year. So far, HBO Max has introduced \u201csoft messaging\u201d surrounding the change, but it hasn\u2019t begun to strictly enforce the policy.\nThe streamer added 3.4 million subscribers in the months following its debrand from Max to HBO Max, and it will begin driving paid sharing \u201cin a much more aggressive fashion\u201d later this year, according to Perette. HBO Max currently uses account information, IP addresses, device IDs, and user activity to determine if someone is sharing their account with a person outside their household.\nWarner Bros. Discovery execs expect paid sharing to boost subscriber growth, which Netflix reported following its clampdown. But as subscription fatigue continues to grow, making people pay to share their passwords might not go over smoothly with subscribers."

      "text": "Netflix is about to kick your best friend off your account \u2014 unless you pay for them to share your account, that is. On Tuesday, Netflix revealed the details of how its crackdown on password sharing will affect viewers in the US and how much it will cost to keep extra people on your account.\nIf you have the Netflix Standard plan that costs $15.49 per month, then you have the option of adding one extra member who can use the service outside your household for $7.99 extra each month. Anyone who pays for the Netflix Premium package with 4K streaming has the option of adding up to two extra members, but each one will still cost another $7.99. The US isn\u2019t the only country where the new rules are rolling out either, as Netflix in the UK will charge subscribers \u00a34.99 each month for extra member slots.\nNetflix subscribers on its two cheapest plans (Basic or Standard with Ads, which cost $9.99 and $6.99 per month, respectively) don\u2019t have the option to add extra members to their account at all.\nNetflix subscribers in the US who share the service \u201coutside their household\u201d will get an email about the company\u2019s password-sharing policies beginning on Tuesday, according to the blog post.\nNetflix\u2019s paid password-sharing experiments have been happening for a while, and it expanded its tests to Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain in February. The password-sharing crackdown was originally supposed to hit the US at the beginning of this year, but the company pushed that launch back again in April.\nA support page explaining the new setup describes \u201cextra members\u201d as someone who will have their own password and profile, paid for by the person who \u201cinvited\u201d them to join. Extra member accounts also have their own set of restrictions. They have to be activated in the same country, they can only view or download content on one device at a time, and they can\u2019t create extra profiles or log in as a Kids profile.\nYour Netflix household, according to the company, is set based on where you watch Netflix on a TV and what IP address that device uses. That location can be reset using the app on a TV or a device connected to a TV by choosing to confirm or update your household and responding to a verification link sent to the account\u2019s listed email address or phone number.\nWe use information such as IP addresses, device IDs, and account activity to determine whether a device signed into your account is part of your Netflix Household.\nWe do not collect GPS data to try to determine the precise physical location of your devices.\nIf a Netflix Household hasn\u2019t been set, we will automatically set one for you based on IP address, device IDs, and account activity.\nYou can always update your Netflix Household from a TV by connecting to your internet and following the steps above.\nNetflix used to be very pro-password sharing \u2014 in March 2017, it famously tweeted, \u201cLove is sharing a password.\u201d (That tweet, as of this writing, is still up.) But in early 2022, it started testing ways to end the practice and get people to pay for accounts using Netflix outside of the account owner\u2019s household.\nIn April 2022, the company revealed that it lost subscribers for the first time in over a decade, and it said at the time that more than 100 million households were getting Netflix through password sharing.\nAs it\u2019s tried to turn that subscriber growth around, cracking down on password sharing is just one of many levers the company has pulled. It also introduced an ads plan, which has nearly 5 million global active users and has invested heavily in games as an extra perk for subscribers.\nUpdate May 23rd, 7:24PM ET: Added UK pricing.\nDisclosure: The Verge recently produced a series with Netflix."

Discovery said on the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call that messaging to consumers is about to get more \u201caggressive.\u201d The media company looking to close the loopholes by the end of 2025, with the impact starting to appear in its financials by 2026.\nFollowing in Netflix\u2019s lead, WBD, Disney and other media companies are all ramping up efforts to limit password sharing, anticipating a significant financial payoff from cracking down on once-overlooked practice.\nSeveral months of testing has enabled WBD to determine \u201cwho\u2019s a legitimate user who may not be a legitimate user,\u201d Perrette said. Once that is determined, he continued, the next step is to \u201cturn on the more aggressive language around what needs to happen\u201d in order to and make sure that \u201cwe are putting the net in the right place, so to speak.\u201d\nWatch on Deadline\nAsked about what \u201cinning\u201d the process is in, to use the baseball clich\u00e9, Perrette said only the first. By the fourth quarter, he said, the process will be happening \u201cin a much more aggressive fashion.\u201d\n\u201cThe message language right now has been a fairly soft, cancel-able message,\u201d he said. It will \u201cstart to get more fixed and such that people have to take action as opposed to right now, sort of having to be a voluntary process.\u201d Once those directives are established, he said, \u201cthe real benefit will start probably in the fourth quarter and then kick in in 2026.\u201d\nWBD reported solid results for the quarter, adding 3.4 million streaming subscribers (mostly via international expansion) to reach 125.7 million overall.\nGreedy. Lame. Ridiculous. \u2018Murica.\nSo you\u2019re saying cancel my account since they want to be greedy? Copy that\nOh hey, there goes the one subscription I thought was worth keeping. Once it takes affect I\u2019ll cancel after 7 years\nLove how a \u201cfeature\u201d (Share with Family and Friends) turns into a \u201cproblem\u201d (Thieves stealing content) when the market gets saturated.\nIt\u2019s a shame they don\u2019t spend as much time on their content as they do trying to figure out how to screw their own customers.\nNot customers.

While at one point, Paramount Plus had removed \u201cSouth Park\u201d from its streaming lineup, leaving only the specials, the series is now available, in full, on their service. All 392 episodes are right there, available in just a few clicks.\nCreators Trey Parker and Matt Stone signed a $1.5 billion deal to continue the series on Comedy Central, and now that the negotiations have resolved, the best place to watch the series is once again on Paramount Plus, its official home.\nHowever, the same deal that brought the show back to one service was its death knell on another. As of Aug. 5, HBO Max has pulled all 26 seasons of the beloved, controversial comedy from its roster. That means you can no longer find any \u201cSouth Park\u201d content on HBO Max.\nIf you\u2019re interested in watching, you will have to sign up for another service.\nThe good news is that there is a lot of flexibility in the other options that are available to you. As we\u2019ve mentioned, the first 26 seasons of the series are available on Paramount Plus. This is also a great place to watch the season 27 premiere, and future episodes the day after they release.\nHowever, if you\u2019re looking to watch Comedy Central live, so you don\u2019t miss new episodes the second they premiere, you can also sign up for a free trial of Philo, DirecTV, or Fubo TV (free trial), or you can get 1/2 off your first month of Sling TV.

      "text": "\u201cSouth Park\u201d has survived a second round of uncertainty around the second episode of season 27. True to form, the show immediately did its best to stir up a new controversy.\nOnce again, we won\u2019t spoil it here, but the new episode is less likely to be controversial for its depiction of President Donald Trump than for the way it poked fun at Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.\nYou can watch all of season 27 so far on its official home on Paramount+ (free trial), where the series is once again available, or by signing up for a free trial of Philo, DirecTV, or Fubo TV (free trial), or you can get 1/2 off your first month of Sling TV.\nThe episode was titled \u201cGot a Nut,\u201d and it turned the series ruthless sense of humor on Vice President J.D. Vance and Charlie Kirk, as well.\nTrey Parker and Matt Stone created \u201cSouth Park\u201d in 1997 on a shoestring budget, and though the animation techniques they used have evolved, it still retains the look of its original cutout animation. Parker and Stone are also the show\u2019s lead writers, and they voice most of the show\u2019s iconic characters, which include Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Kenny McCormick, and Eric Cartman.\nHow to watch \u2018South Park\u2019 online on-demand\nThe confusion surrounding where to stream \u201cSouth Park\u201d seems to have abated. As of the premiere of season 27 airing on July 23, the show has returned to Paramount Plus, where it is available to stream in its entirety.

The story follows 4th graders Cartman, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny as they get into various extreme hijinks around the small, titular Colorado town they live in.
