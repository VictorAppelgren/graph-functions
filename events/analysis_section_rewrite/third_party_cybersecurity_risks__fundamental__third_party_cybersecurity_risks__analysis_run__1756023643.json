      "feedback": "Overall verdict: the draft correctly nails a multi‑year regime where cyber risk structurally shapes operations and pricing, but it would reach world‑class quality with a tighter, first‑principles framing, a formal regime ladder with explicit triggers, a transparent causal chain to market pricing, and quantified sensitivity scaffolding tied to the cited numbers. Actionable edits in one compact paragraph: replace the generic language with a simple invariant—expected loss = probability of a breach × impact (mapped to supply‑chain disruption costs, regulatory penalties, and insurance/credit terms)—and anchor it to concrete anchors in the sources (87% mid‑market concern; 55% AI‑driven cybersecurity adoption by Aug; 5.9% average revenue saved, 7.7% in high‑impact tasks; AI embedding around 6–7 years; Amazon hacking frequency up sevenfold; 60% of digital shoppers mobile, etc.); structure into a clean horizon‑driven sequence with a Regime 1 (early AI adoption, higher third‑party exposure), Regime 2 (mid adoption, more robust digital identity/Zero‑Trust, stronger vendor governance), Regime 3 (broad AI‑enabled resilience, calibrated risk premia) and specify transition triggers (major third‑party breach, regulatory shifts, rapid AI threat escalation) and an invalidation event (AI defenses outpace threats or a breakthrough in vendor isolation reduces extended‑enterprise risk). Explicitly map the causal chain: extended enterprise and social engineering drive demand for B2B cyber audits and digital‑identity modernization, which shapes risk pricing, credit terms, and cyber‑insurance profitability; tie each link to the numeric anchors cited. Add a base‑case probability band and a short list of watch indicators (uptake pace of GenAI cybersecurity, counts of third‑party incidents, changes in cyber‑insurance pricing/coverage, automated fraud‑detection adoption) and keep the conclusion that the regime is structural but the calibration of risk pricing will hinge on evolving attacker sophistication and regulatory responses. Ensure every assertion cites the source IDs (C65X5MY62 and its scraped sources 1–5) and avoid any claims beyond the stated numbers; if tensions arise, present them as competing narratives within the same extended‑enterprise framework.",
