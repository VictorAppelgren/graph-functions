  "title": "5 Ways OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 Is Supercharging ChatGPT for Users",
  "description": "OpenAI\u2019s latest rollout of GPT-5 as the default artificial intelligence (AI) model for ChatGPT brings with it several new capabilities that can power up",
  "content": "All built-in tools are enabled automatically, with a future goal to support external development tools.\n\nPlus users see usage limits double to 160 messages every three hours, while Team and Pro tiers get unlimited GPT-5 access.\n\nGPT-5 is giving ChatGPT more capabilities in at least five areas.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s latest rollout of GPT-5 as the default artificial intelligence (AI) model for ChatGPT brings with it several new capabilities that can power up productivity for business and personal users.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nGPT-5 transforms ChatGPT into an AI model that can automatically switch between doing quick search and research tasks or dive into reasoning mode, which typically takes longer to generate a response.\n\n\u201cGPT-5 will automatically decide to use reasoning or not. Switching should be smoother in the next update,\u201d said Elaine Ya Le, a researcher at OpenAI, during a recent Q&A by OpenAI\u2019s team with users on Reddit.\n\nTo force ChatGPT to go into \u201cthinking\u201d mode instead of waiting for it to switch, Ya Le said to prompt it: \u201cYou can add \u2018think hard\u2019 to your prompt to simply trigger reasoning mode.\u201d\n\nBefore GPT-5, ChatGPT users could choose between GPT models and the \u201co\u201d reasoning series of models. GPT-5 merges both capabilities.\n\nChatGPT Plus subscribers can send up to 160 messages using GPT-5 every three hours. That\u2019s twice as many as prior models, according to OpenAI\u2019s community forums.\n\n\u201cWe are going to double rate limits for Plus users as we finish rollout,\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman confirmed during the Q&A with Redditors.\n\nThe more expensive Team and Pro plans get unlimited usage with GPT-5, unless this privilege is abused such as sharing the account with other users. For older AI models, Team accounts faced usage caps.\n\nFor GPT-5 Thinking, Plus users are capped at 200 messages per week if they manually select this option. When ChatGPT switches to \u201cThinking\u201d mode by itself, this does not count toward the quota.\n\nEric Mitchell from OpenAI\u2019s research team told Redditors that OpenAI \u201cdefinitely\u201d intends Plus users to have \u201cunlimited access to reasoning.\u201d\n\nFor the free tier, GPT-5 gives users 10 messages every five hours. Previously they were capped at an unspecified \u201climited\u201d number of messages every five hours under GPT-4o.\n\nFree users also get one GPT-5 Thinking message per day.\n\nNo More Access to 7 AI Models\n\nWith the launch of GPT-5, OpenAI is discontinuing immediate access to the following AI models that used to be options in ChatGPT:\n\nFree users will see this change immediately. Paying users can restore access by adjusting the settings on the web version of ChatGPT.\n\nSupports All Tools Available in ChatGPT\n\nUsers don\u2019t have to toggle tools on or off with GPT-5. They are automatically enabled depending on what the user needs.\n\nFor example, when a user tells ChatGPT to analyze a spreadsheet, it will use the data analysis tool. In prior models, the user needed to prompt ChatGPT to \u201cdraw a picture\u201d to trigger the image generation tool. While GPT-4o\u2019s \u201cagent mode\u201d let the AI act proactively, GPT-5 is more streamlined, according to the startup.\n\nAsked on Reddit whether ChatGPT will one day allow third-party plugins inside the integrated development environment (IDE), Daniel Levine from OpenAI\u2019s product team responded: \u201cYes, this is very much our goal. We want ChatGPT to help you build software with external tools.\u201d\n\nNew Voice Mode Better at Following Instructions\n\nThere are two ways to use \u201cvoice\u201d mode: clicking on the microphone icon in the prompt window and speaking a prompt or query for ChatGPT to process; and activating full \u201cvoice\u201d mode and interacting directly with the model.\n\nSulman Choudhry, head of engineering at OpenAI, said voice mode is now better at following instructions with GPT-5.\n\n\u201cChatGPT is doing more and more economically valuable work for our users,\u201d Choudhry told Redditors. \u201cWe launched a new voice model that is better at instruction following and will keep making it better.\u201d\n\nAll free users will also get access to advanced voice mode, according to Choudhry.\n\nOverall, Mitchell told Redditors that users should get more advanced capabilities with GPT-5: \u201cGPT-5 is a huge improvement over GPT-4 in a few key areas: It thinks better (reasoning), writes better (creativity), follows instructions more closely and is more aligned to user intent.\u201d\n\nOpenAI Takes on Rivals Meta, DeepSeek With 2 New Models",

      "text": "That\u2019s according to a report Sunday (Aug. 3) by Bloomberg News, which says the so-called \u201cAnswers, Knowledge and Information\u201d (AKI) group is building an \u201canswer engine\u201d \u2014 a system capable of crawling the web for responses to general-knowledge questions.\nThe report says Apple is exploring a standalone app, as well as new back-end infrastructure aimed at powering search capabilities in future iterations of Siri, Spotlight, and Safari.\nBloomberg notes that Apple has also recently begun advertising job openings for the team on its careers site:\n\u201cOur work fuels intuitive information experiences across some of Apple\u2019s most iconic products, including Siri, Spotlight, Safari, Messages, Lookup, and more. Join us in shaping the future of how the world connects with information!\u201d\nMany of these listings specifically mention experience with search algorithms and engine development, leading Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman to conclude that while a finished product may still be a long way off, the company is unmistakably working on\u201d a stripped-down, Apple-built approach to ChatGPT-like search.\u201d\nApple CEO Tim Cook said last week that the company planned to \u201csignificantly\u201d step up its AI investments and dedicate more staff toward building its Apple Intelligence features.\nSpeaking during an earnings call, Cook said Apple is making \u201cgood progress\u201d on infusing more AI capabilities in Siri, which are due next year. The tech giant aims to come up with a \u201cmore personalized\u201d Siri and for AI features in iOS to be \u201cdeeply personal, private and seamlessly integrated,\u201d the CEO said.\nHis comments came two days after reports that investors had grown disillusioned with Apple\u2019s lack of progress on the AI front.\nApple\u2019s investors have reason to be nervous about the company\u2019s \u201cAI crisis,\u201d PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster wrote July 23.\n\u201cApple Intelligence doesn\u2019t appear in any serious public Gen AI rankings,\u201d Webster wrote. \u201cIt lags behind even X.ai\u2019s Grok. That\u2019s not a public relations problem. It\u2019s a strategic misstep.\nMaybe even a crater-sized hole that could prove Apple\u2019s fatal flaw.\u201d\nWebster added that while Apple\u2019s rivals are \u201caccelerating, iterating and launching new GenAI tools and agents across products and platforms,\u201d the iPhone maker is banking on the idea of catching up by weaving OpenAI into Siri\u2026\u201d a year from now.\u201d"

      "text": "\u201cThis week, ChatGPT is on track to reach 700M weekly active users \u2014 up from 500M at the end of March and 4\u00d7 since last year,\u201d Nick Turley, the company\u2019s head of product, wrote in a post on X Monday (Aug. 4).\n\u201cEvery day, people and teams are learning, creating, and solving harder problems. Big week ahead. Grateful to the team for making ChatGPT more useful and delivering on our mission so everyone can benefit from AI.\u201d\nThe news comes as OpenAI is set to debut its GPT-5 model. According to published reports last month, this model will incorporate distinct AI models to perform different functions, as well as OpenAI\u2019s o3 model and other technologies.\nThis follows CEO Sam Altman\u2019s statement in February that the company is working to simplify its offerings by unifying its o-series models and GPT-series models, thus creating systems that can use all the company\u2019s tools and be useful for a range of tasks.\n\u201cWe want AI to \u2018just work\u2019 for you; we realize how complicated our model and product offerings have gotten,\u201d Altman wrote. \u201cWe hate the model picker as much as you do and want to return to magic unified intelligence.\u201d\nLast week, OpenAI was valued at $300 billion after concluding its latest round of fundraising, which was five times oversubscribed.\nThe startup snagged $8.3 billion months earlier than expected, per a report from The New York Times\u2019 DealBook. The funding is part of the company\u2019s effort to secure $40 billion in funding this year, to which SoftBank has pledged $30 billion.\nThe biggest investor was Dragoneer Investment Group, at $2.8 billion. DealBook called it an \u201castonishing check\u201d from a single venture fund that \u201cmay be one of the largest ever written.\u201d\nMeanwhile, new research from PYMNTS Intelligence shows growing optimism about generative AI among chief product officers, particularly in the tech sector. That\u2019s a factor likely driven in part by a stronger familiarity with AI tools.\n\u201cThis divergence matters. Tech firms moving to operationalize gen AI are better positioned to shape internal standards, influence vendor priorities and define early benchmarks for success\u2014all outcomes that can fuel widespread adoption across other industries,\u201d PYMNTS wrote. \u201cBy contrast, sectors still weighing trade-offs may forgo speed in exchange for certainty, but they risk falling behind as gen AI tools evolve at lightning speed.\u201d\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter."

However, we can provide you with some information to help you manage your usage.\nAs of May 13th, 2024, Plus users can send up to 80 messages every 3 hours on GPT-4o and up to 40 messages every 3 hours on GPT-4. During peak hours, these limits might be reduced to ensure that the service remains accessible to as many people as possible.\nFor users in a ChatGPT Team workspace, the message caps are higher than those for individual Plus users. Please keep in mind that unused messages do not carry over to the next period (i.e., waiting 6 hours won\u2019t give you 80 messages for the next 3 hours on GPT-4).\nWe appreciate your understanding and are here to help if you have any other questions or need further assistance.\nBest,\nAlpha\nOpenAI Support"

      "text": "OpenAI\u2019s new gpt-oss models come in two sizes: 120 billion and 20 billion parameters, or the statistical relationships learned by a model during training. Generally speaking, the higher the parameter count, the more capable the model.\n\u201cWe believe this is the best and most usable open model in the world,\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a post on X.\nThe last time OpenAI released an open model was in 2019, with GPT-2. But GPT-2 was fully open \u2014 making it truly open-source \u2014 albeit done in stages over months. OpenAI didn\u2019t say whether gpt-oss will eventually be open-source as well.\nGpt-oss is a text-only, open-weights model, meaning the user can use and fine-tune the model but not know how it was trained or what data it was trained on.\nWithout knowing the data that went into the model, companies do not get full transparency, which could add risks to companies in financial services, healthcare and other highly regulated industries.\nFor example, a healthcare company might want to fully vet a model\u2019s training process before deploying it on personal patient data.\n\u201cIf only open weights are available, developers \u2026 lack the ability to meaningfully evaluate biases, limitations, and societal impacts,\u201d according to the Prompt Engineering and AI Institute.\nHowever, OpenAI is granting access under the Apache 2.0 license, which gives the user \u201cperpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright\u201d to produce and distribute it.\n\u201cThese open models also lower barriers for emerging markets, resource-constrained sectors, and smaller organizations that may lack the budget or flexibility to adopt proprietary models,\u201d according to OpenAI.\nUsers can download GPT-OSS on Hugging Face or view on GitHub.\nRead more: OpenAI Adds 200 Million Weekly Users in 4 Months\nThe Open AI Model Race\nMajor contenders for dominance in the open-source arena are Meta, with its Llama flagship of models but with usage and redistribution restrictions; France\u2019s Mistral AI; and Chinese providers such as DeepSeek and Alibaba for most of its Qwen models.\nAltman called gpt-oss \u201ca big deal,\u201d with \u201cstrong real-world performance\u201d comparable to o4-mini. (The o, or omni, series comprises OpenAI\u2019s reasoning models \u2014 a new family of models after its GPT series.)\nFor example, in the MMLU benchmark that tests how well LLMs perform a broad range of academic and professional tasks, gpt-oss is not far behind OpenAI o3 and o4-mini in performance.\nOpenAI said the gpt-oss 120-billion parameter model can run on the user\u2019s own computer and the smaller model can be run on a smartphone. Typically, AI models especially larger ones, run in the cloud.\nWhile releasing an open model means bad actors can use it for evil, Altman said the company thinks \u201cfar more good than bad will come from it.\u201d This is a departure from 2019, when OpenAI released GPT-2 in stages, fearful that it would used for ill.\nThe rest of OpenAI\u2019s models are closed and proprietary. Its rivals have released varying degrees of open models: Google has open-weight, not open-source, models like Gemma. Anthropic doesn\u2019t have an open model. Microsoft open-sourced its Phi models. Amazon\u2019s models are proprietary.\nRead more:\nApple AI Team Working on ChatGPT Rival\nOpenAI Raises New Funding to Hit $300 Billion Valuation\nMicrosoft Seeks to Extend Access to OpenAI Technology"
