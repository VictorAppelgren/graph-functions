  "content": "The company's declining sales and margins are concerning, but they underscore the need for robotaxis to become a significant part of the business.\n\nIf buying Tesla (TSLA 6.18%) is indeed going to set an investor up for life, then its robotaxi business will have to be successful, and CEO Elon Musk will have to achieve his aim of making unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) software publicly available. While it's uncertain if those things will happen, there's one trend in the electric vehicle (EV) industry that significantly strengthens the case for Tesla. But to understand it, it's important to start by addressing one key issue.\n\nMusk is a divisive figure, but he's not the only CEO to attract controversy or take positions that some find disagreeable and others find enlightened. This isn't the place to enter that debate, but it is the place to look at matters rationally. A standard narrative has it that Tesla's declining electric vehicle sales in 2025 are a consequence of Musk's political involvement. If this were the case, Tesla would, indeed, have a major structural issue that definitely wouldn't make it a stock to buy in hopes of it putting you on easy street.\n\nMy opinion is that the evidence for this argument is weak. Tesla doesn't have a sales problem because of Musk. It has a Model Y problem, and it has an interest rate problem. Let's put it this way: According to Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book report, sales of Tesla's Model Y (its best-selling sport utility vehicle, or SUV) were down more than 24% in 2025 year to date through mid-July compared to the same period in 2024. In contrast, sales of its second best-selling car, the Tesla Model 3 (a mid-size sedan), rose almost 38% on the same basis.\n\nIf anti-Musk sentiment were behind the sales drop, that would show up for both models. Something else is going on.\n\nMore likely, it's the fact that other automakers have developed SUVs at price points that are highly competitive to the Tesla Model Y, even though many of them continue to lose significant amounts of money on EVs. Examples of SUV EVs gaining market share in the U.S. are Chevrolet's Blazer and Equinox, Nissan's Ariya, Hyundai's Ionic 5, and Honda's Prologue.\n\nGeneral Motors' (NYSE: GM) Chevrolet is a case in point. Earlier in the year, GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said, \"We achieved variable profit positive on our EVs in the fourth quarter.\" This is a good step, but it only means that revenue from its EVs covers the cost of labor and materials to build them. That's fine if GM is going to make the same model in perpetuity. It's not fine if GM is going to spend on research and development, factories, and other capital investments to develop a new car.\n\nIn reality, what's happening to Tesla is a textbook example of new entrants driving down the sales and margins of an established industry leader by building loss-making vehicles with the intent to build the scale and market presence to turn profitable at some point.\n\nAs such, Tesla's margins are being squeezed by a combination of competitors entering the SUV EV market and by ongoing relatively high interest rates -- it's not a coincidence that its well-performing Model 3 is its cheapest model.\n\nIt's also not a coincidence that Tesla's response to these conditions is to create a long-awaited, low-cost model, which is \"just a Model Y\" according to Musk.\n\nWhat it means for Tesla investors\n\nThe key to Tesla's future is the robotaxi and unsupervised FSD. Both are subject to debate, and Tesla remains a high-risk/high-reward stock that won't suit most investors.\n\nBut here's the thing. The profitability challenges inherent in EVs, combined with the difficulty of producing low-cost, affordable EV models at a profit for all automakers, strengthen the idea that robotaxis and ride-sharing have a big future as a solution to the problem.\n\nEVs tend to have high upfront costs, but low operating and maintenance costs. Therefore, their most economically productive use could turn out to be as robotaxis, where they are heavily utilized to take advantage of their low running costs and justify their upfront price tags.\n\nAs such, if the future is EVs, whether by personally owned cars or robotaxis, then Tesla's approach is the right one, and it has the potential to generate significant returns for investors if it gets robotaxis and unsupervised FSD right. Whether it will set investors up for life is an unknown -- and planning on any one stock to do that would be foolish -- but it's got lots of promise.",

      "text": "Tesla (TSLA 6.18%) is one of the world's best-known and most popular companies. A big driver of its popularity is the presence of outspoken co-founder and CEO Elon Musk.\nThe visionary Musk, who also leads SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink, xAI, and X (formerly Twitter), created Tesla with one ambitious goal: to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass-market electric cars to market as soon as possible.\nMusk has certainly succeeded with that mission. Tesla produced almost 1.8 million electric vehicles (EVs) in 2024. In addition to producing EVs, Tesla develops, manufactures, and installs solar energy systems (Solar City), battery storage systems (Powerwall), and EV charging infrastructure (Superchargers). It has also developed other technologies, including autopilot, self-driving features, and artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe company is as ambitious as ever. Tesla aims to help lead the planet to sustainability. A key aspect of that strategy is to significantly ramp up its EV production. The company plans to build more gigafactories to manufacture its EVs, battery storage systems, and other sustainable energy products.\nThese investments should help drive the company's revenue and profits, giving the stock the power to soar and making Tesla a compelling stock for investors to buy. Here's a step-by-step guide to buying Tesla's stock and some things to consider before you do.\nHow to buy\nHow to buy Tesla stock\nTo buy shares of Tesla, you must have a brokerage account. If you need to open one, here are some of the best-rated brokers and trading platforms. This step-by-step guide will show how to buy Tesla stock:\n- Open your brokerage app: Log in to your brokerage account where you handle your investments.\n- Search for the stock: Enter the ticker or company name into the search bar to bring up the stock's trading page.\n- Decide how many shares to buy: Consider your investment goals and how much of your portfolio you want to allocate to this stock.\n- Select order type: Choose between a market order to buy at the current price or a limit order to specify the maximum price you're willing to pay.\n- Submit your order: Confirm the details and submit your buy order.\n- Review your purchase: Check your portfolio to ensure your order was filled as expected and adjust your investment strategy accordingly.\nShould I invest?\nShould I invest in Tesla?\nBefore buying shares in Tesla, you need to decide whether you should invest in Tesla stock. Here are some reasons to consider investing in Tesla:\n- You want to invest in a company driven to accelerate the adoption of sustainable energy.\n- You understand the risks of investing in Tesla, including the possibility that shares could lose value.\n- You've thoroughly researched Tesla and understand how it makes money.\n- You believe Tesla's strategy will increase its revenue and earnings at an above-average rate over the long term.\n- You want to invest directly in stocks and have the time to follow the company.\n- You don't need to earn dividend income.\n- You are confident that Elon Musk can lead Tesla and handle all his other responsibilities.\n- You plan to hold shares for the long term and ride out any near-term volatility.\n- You think that more auto companies will follow Ford (F 3.44%), GM (GM 3.17%), and Rivian (RIVN 7.8%) in adopting Tesla's supercharging network, making it a growth driver for the company.\nConversely, here are some reasons an investor might choose not to buy shares of Tesla:\n- You need the money you plan to invest in Tesla stock to cover emergencies or for a major planned purchase within the next three to five years.\n- You're concerned about the company's valuation.\n- You're worried about the economy, your job, health issues within your family, or other pressing matters.\n- You have yet to research Tesla and need to know what it does and how it makes money.\n- You don't have the time to invest directly in stocks and follow Tesla.\n- You're near retirement and need dividend income.\n- You're concerned about the risk that shares could lose value.\n- Elon Musk's values don't align with yours.\n- You're worried that Musk's focus on his other business pursuits like X or his involvement in DOGE could take away his focus on creating value for Tesla shareholders.\n- You don't think other automakers' growing adoption of Tesla's supercharger network will be a profit driver.\nProfitability\nIs Tesla profitable?\nEarnings growth is one of the key drivers of a company's stock price over the long term.\nTesla is a very profitable company. The company reported $97.7 billion of revenue in 2024 (up 1%) and $7 billion of net income. While its earnings were down sharply from the prior year (down 53%), that was because it received a $5.9 billion one-time, noncash tax benefit the prior year.\nTesla is also free-cash-flow positive. The company produced $3.6 billion in free cash flow in 2024, which helped grow its cash and investments balance to $36.6 billion. This put Tesla in a strong financial position.\nTesla's strong profitability and cash flow should help power its stock over the long term. If the company can continue growing earnings faster than average, the share price should gain value in the coming years. However, shares could crash in value if Tesla hits an earnings growth speed bump.\nDividends\nDoes Tesla pay a dividend?\nAs of 2025, Tesla didn't make dividend payments to its shareholders. The company retains 100% of its earnings and cash flow to reinvest in growing the business and its cash balance.\nGiven the company's continued heavy investments in expansion, it likely won't start paying dividends anytime soon. It's not an ideal stock for those who need to earn passive income for retirement.\nETF options\nETFs with exposure to Tesla\nInstead of actively buying shares directly, you can passively invest in Tesla by investing in a fund holding its stock. Tesla is one of the largest publicly traded companies by market capitalization and is a widely held stock.\nTesla is in several stock market indexes, including the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite index. As a result, index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that benchmark their returns against those indexes hold Tesla stock.\nAccording to ETF.com, 404 ETFs held a reported 403.9 million shares of Tesla as of early 2025.\nExchange-Traded Fund (ETF)\nAmong the most notable funds with a meaningful weighting to Tesla stock are:\n- Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY 3.0%): This fund provides investors with exposure to the consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500 index. Tesla was the ETF's second-largest holding in early 2025 at a 14.8% allocation. This fund has a very low ETF expense ratio of 0.08%.\n- Simplify Volt TSLA Revolution ETF (NYSEMKT:TESL): This fund aims to make a concentrated bet on disruptive companies it believes will dominate the autonomous driving sector. Tesla was its top holding in early 2025 with a 17% allocation, split between an 11% equity position and a 6% call option position. The fund has a relatively high expense ratio of 0.99%.\n- ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ 3.33%): The actively managed ETF by Cathie Wood focuses on investing in companies engaged in autonomous technology and robotics. Tesla was the fund's largest holding in early 2025 at an 11.4% allocation. The ETF has a 0.75% expense ratio.\nStock splits\nWill Tesla stock split?\nAs of early 2025, Tesla did not have an upcoming stock split. However, the company has completed two stock splits in its history as a public company:\n| Type of Stock Split | Date | Pre-Split Price |\n|---|---|---|\n| 5-for-1 | August 2020 | Around $2,200 per share |\n| 3-for-1 | August 2022 | Around $900 per share |\nEach time the company split its stock, the share price decreased to a more accessible level for individual investors. The most recent split reduced the share price to about $300.\nAs of early 2025, Tesla stock was below that post-split level at roughly $250 per share. It seems unlikely that Tesla will split its stock anytime soon. Given the historical trend, Tesla will likely wait until shares are closer to $1,000 before announcing another split.\nRelated investing topics\nThe bottom line\nThe bottom line on investing in Tesla stock\nTesla is one of the most innovative companies in the world. It has a charismatic and controversial leader driving the company toward an ambitious mission. If he's successful, Tesla's stock price could ride higher, enriching its shareholders in the process.\nMany people want to invest in Tesla stock. It's easy to buy shares. However, before you do, make sure you want to. It might not be for everyone.\nFAQs\nFAQs on Tesla\nDoes Tesla use AI?\nTesla is among the growing number of companies using artificial intelligence (AI). The company uses AI to improve its autonomous driving capabilities, among other things. The company increased its AI compute training by more than 400% in 2024 as it seeks to leverage that technology to drive more of its operations.\nCan anyone invest in Tesla stock?\nAnyone with a brokerage account can invest in Tesla stock. The company trades on the Nasdaq exchange under the stock ticker TSLA.\nWho is the CEO of Tesla?\nElon Musk has served as the CEO of Tesla since October 2008.\nWhen was Tesla founded?\nTesla was founded in July 2003 in San Carlos, Calif."

      "text": "Revenue and profit are two of the most important numbers to focus on for business owners and stock investors alike. Revenue is the total amount of money the company has earned in a given period; profit is what's left after expenses have been deducted.\nFor some companies, markups and efficiency are so high that there isn't much of a difference between revenue and profit. For other, more capital-intensive businesses, a net profit of 2% or 3% is a good year.\nLet's drill down into the key differences between the two numbers and then walk through an example.\nKey differences between revenue and profit\nKey differences between revenue and profit\nThe key difference is that revenue has not had any expenses deducted from it. Profit (and there are different kinds of profit) is revenue minus expenses. It can even be a negative number if the company lost money.\nRevenue and the various types of profit are reported on the income statement (also known as the profit and loss statement). The statement starts with revenue on the top line and then goes through the types of expenses before ending with net income, or the bottom line.\nLet's go over the different types of profit, starting at the top.\n- Gross profit: The first type of profit is gross profit. Gross profit is equal to revenue minus cost of goods sold. The costs of goods sold vary by industry but follow the same general concept -- they are the direct costs tied to sales. For a company such as Target (TGT 1.98%), the cost of goods sold would include the cost of inventory and labor hours in stores. A company's gross margin gives you a good idea of how much it can mark up its goods or services from the prices it's paying to suppliers.\n- Operating profit: The next one down the line is operating profit. Think of operating profit as gross profit minus overhead. Most other types of expenses that are key to operations -- such as rent, administrative salaries, and insurance -- are classified as operating expenses. Operating profit shows you how much money the core business is earning.\n- Net profit: Net profit is what's left over after all other expenses are deducted. This includes taxes, interest expenses, and one-time items such as legal settlements. These expenses can vary greatly from year to year. The other expenses also aren't tied to business core operations, so they don't fit into the cost of goods sold or operating expenses categories. Net profit (and the earnings-per-share version, or EPS) is the number most followed by the stock market. Understanding that net profit may be volatile even when gross and operating profit are consistent can give you leg up on other investors.\nOnce you get the hang of evaluating financial statements, the differences in these numbers will be second nature. As a beginner, the most important thing to keep in mind is that revenue is the top line number that shows how much money the company has earned during the period. Profit is what's left over after the different types of expenses are covered.\nRevenue vs. profit example\nRevenue vs. profit example\nLet's look at two companies with very different cost structures, starting with Target:\n| Oct. 31, 2021 (numbers in millions) | Dollar Amounts | Percentage |\n|---|---|---|\n| Revenue | $25,652 | 100% |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | $18,206 | 71% |\n| Gross Profit | $7,446 | 29% |\n| Operating Expenses | $5,436 | 21% |\n| Operating Income | $2,010 | 8% |\n| Other Expenses | $522 | 2% |\n| Net Income | $1,488 | 6% |\nTarget produced $25.7 billion of revenue in the third quarter of 2021. On average, $0.71 of every dollar went to cost of goods sold. That means, on average, the stuff you bought from Target costs them about 71% of what you paid, leading to a gross profit of $7.5 billion, or 29%.\nOperating Expenses\nNext, $5.4 billion, or 21% of revenue, went to operating expenses. For retailers like Target, it's normal for overhead to cost a lot less than the direct cost of goods sold.\nFinally, taxes and other expenses amounted to $522 million, bringing Target's net profit, the bottom line, to $1.5 billion, or 6% of revenue.\nNow let's look at DocuSign (DOCU 5.78%):\n| Dec. 31, 2021 (numbers in thousands) | Dollar Amounts | Percentage |\n|---|---|---|\n| Revenue | $545,463 | 100% |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | $115,975 | 21% |\n| Gross Profit | $429,488 | 79% |\n| Operating Expenses | $432,846 | 80% |\n| Operating Income | ($3,358) | -1% |\n| Other Expenses | $2,318 | 0% |\n| Net Income | ($5,676) | -1% |\nDocuSign isn't quite as big as Target; its quarterly sales came to $545 million. About 21% went to cost of goods sold, producing a $430 million gross profit, which was 79% of revenue.\nThe gross profit margin seems great until you see the operating expenses number, which was about $3 million more than gross profit. The expenses mean the company had an operating loss in the quarter equal to around 1% of revenue. Add in the other expenses, and the net loss was $5.7 million.\nDocuSign's business model is completely different than Target's, and it shows in the income statement. DocuSign sells subscriptions to its valuable software services. Target buys products from other businesses, marks them up about 30%, and sells them in brick-and-mortar stores.\nRelated investing topics\nBecause of this business model difference, the cost structure is also completely different. Most of Target's expenses are in cost of goods sold because it has to pay for the inventory it sells. DocuSign's cost of goods sold is a lot lower as a percentage of revenue because it doesn't have many direct costs related to each sale.\nOperating expenses are the opposite. Target pays for the overhead it needs to keep going, while DocuSign is investing in overhead. It paid $400 million in this quarter alone on research and development and sales costs. It is plowing all its gross profit into future growth, and the operating loss reflects that."

      "text": "If you borrow money, you\u2019re charged an interest rate. If you lend money, you can charge an interest rate. Interest rates affect almost every aspect of financial life -- mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, student loans, bank deposits, and especially your investments.\nWhat is an interest rate?\nWhat is an interest rate?\nAt its heart, an interest rate is the price of borrowing money. Interest rates can be defined as the cost of borrowing money and the benefit of lending it. Interest rates affect a broad spectrum of debt, ranging from big-ticket items like mortgages and auto loans to smaller items, such as basic savings accounts and credit cards.\nBroadly speaking, interest rates in the United States are set by the Federal Reserve Board, a government-appointed entity that supervises banks. The board uses interest rates to ensure that employment remains high and prices are stable. If employment falls, the Fed will often lower interest rates to encourage spending; when prices rise during inflation, the Fed increases interest rates to slow the economy. Its interest rate is known as the federal funds rate -- basically, the rate that banks charge to lend money to one another.\nHow are they determined?\nHow are interest rates determined?\nNot all interest rates are set by the Fed, though. Individual lenders use different criteria to set interest rates charged to different borrowers. The size of the loan, the length of the loan, the borrower\u2019s credit rating, and market factors generally are considered in setting interest rates for loans.\nInterest rates also aren\u2019t necessarily static amounts. Depending on the type of loan, some can be variable rates that rise or fall over time. As a general rule, variable rates are lower because they reflect current market conditions. Fixed rates, on the other hand, are generally higher to account for potential changes in future market conditions.\nFinally, interest expenses can be charged in two fundamental ways. Simple interest is charged only on the original amount of a loan, and it generally doesn\u2019t change. The formula is:\nSimple interest = Principal * Interest Rate * Term of loan\nMeanwhile, compound interest is charged on the original loan amount plus accumulated interest. The formula for determining compound interest is:\nCompound interest = Principal * (1 + Interest Rate)N - P\nWhere \u201cN\u201d is the number of compounding periods in a year.\nCompound Interest\nEffects of interest rates\nEffects of interest rates\nRising interest rates reverberate across the economy. A housing boom, for example, has been cooled by several sharp interest rate hikes in the past. There have been times where interest rates on mortgages fell below a 3%. Shortly after, however, interest rates on mortgages had climbed above 6.5%.\nHow does this affect your investment? Say you\u2019re a homebuyer and are in the market for a mortgage. A $350,000 mortgage at 3.5% over a 30-year loan would be relatively affordable.\nHere\u2019s the formula:\nMonthly payment = Principal * (Interest Rate * (1 + Interest Rate)N)/((1 + Interest Rate)N \u2013 1)\nor\n$350,000 * ((.035 * (1 + .035)360)/((1 + .035)360) \u2013 1,\nwhich works out to a monthly payment of $1,572.\nNow, try a $350,000 mortgage at 6.5% over the same 30-year loan:\n$350,000 * ((.065 * (1 + .065)360)/((1 + .065)360) \u2013 1,\nfor a monthly payment of $2,212 -- $640 more than the lower interest rate.\nInterest rates and investments\nInterest rates and investments\nAlthough interest rates are tied most directly to loans, they\u2019re also an important factor in the success (or lack of success) of your portfolio. When interest rates are high, many investors put money into the bond market since the yields will be higher. For example, a $10,000 Treasury bond with a 5% interest rate may seem attractive at the time. But if interest rates rise sharply, the value of the bonds falls.\nLow interest rates, on the other hand, tend to favor stocks over bonds. As interest rates fall, so does the attractiveness of bonds. Investors will move money from the bond market to stocks, creating more demand and presumably less supply; the prices of stocks will then appreciate faster than the value of bonds.\nOf course, interest rate fluctuations don\u2019t just affect the balance of stocks and bonds. In some cases, they\u2019ve been known to wreak havoc on the financial system. Banks either closed or required bailouts in early 2023 after investing heavily in bonds when interest rates were low.\nConcerns about inflation, however, led the Fed to sharply increase interest rates. The value of the bonds plummeted, depositors became nervous, and demanded their money -- which the banks couldn\u2019t provide without assistance from the government or other banks.\nInterest rates will go up and down; investors shouldn\u2019t attempt to shuffle their holdings according to the whims of the Fed. Instead, smart investors realize that diversification and a long-term buy-and-hold strategy are the best hedges against changing economic conditions. Interest rates can give you an idea of where the economy is heading, but you\u2019re not likely to have much success by adjusting your portfolio based on where you think interest rates will go."

      "text": "Virtually every business needs to make capital investments. Some need land; others require machinery. Even virtual companies that only do online business make a capital investment when they buy computers. We'll explain capital investments in this article, including their uses, their importance, and the types of businesses that rely most heavily on capital investments.\nOverview\nWhat is capital investment?\nA capital investment is money that's spent or borrowed to acquire an asset for long-term use that's required to do business. Capital assets can range from a piece of equipment that's necessary to operate a business to thousands of acres of land required for a farm or other production facility. Even assets that aren't typically considered tangible items, such as intellectual property (IP), can be considered capital investments.\nCapital investments can be used to provide the assets that a business needs for profitable operations, but they can also be used to expand a business by increasing production, creating new products, or simply adding value to existing products.\nBusinesses often make capital investments to replace obsolete equipment or become more efficient. Typically, the investments are made in long-term assets, and their value is determined by calculating the net present value of after-tax cash flows for the potential investment.\nImportance\nImportance of capital investment\nCapital investments can be used to gauge the overall health of the economy, as well as the potential profitability of a company. When the economy is in good shape, capital investment spending tends to be higher since new businesses are created and often expand to meet increased consumer demand. During recessions, companies often cut back on capital spending because of uncertainty over the future of the economy.\nBecause capital investment is such an integral part of economic performance, federal agencies keep close tabs on it. The Federal Reserve Board, for example, tracks investment with 36 asset categories:\n- 30 for equipment.\n- Five for buildings.\n- One for software.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks capital services -- benefits from the deployment of capital investments -- to measure productivity, another key economic barometer. The Energy Information Administration keeps an eye on quarterly capital spending by 40 publicly traded U.S. oil exploration and production companies.\nRelated investing topics\nExamples\nCapital investment-heavy businesses\nAlthough there's been a great deal of emphasis placed on the knowledge economy and service work, many key industries still rely heavily on capital investments to provide vital goods and services. Industries such as agriculture, construction, transportation, and manufacturing are examples of capital-intensive industries that would be either orders of magnitude smaller or not exist at all without capital investment.\nThe energy industry, which accounts for almost 5% of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), is a major part of the economy that relies heavily on capital investment to maintain profitability. Solar panels, wind turbines, power transmission lines, and batteries all rely on capital investments to provide energy to customers.\nFew energy industry segments, however, are as reliant on capital investment as the oil and gas industry. To find oil, companies must invest in cutting-edge equipment, such as seismic monitors, to help them understand the potential for oil and gas fields. More capital must be spent to lease land or buy it outright. Once the land rights are obtained, expensive equipment like drilling rigs must be bought; infrastructure such as roads developed; and transportation modes determined, whether involving trucks, cargo ships, or pipelines to move the oil and gas to a midpoint for refining or further distribution.\nInvestors shouldn't just appreciate the importance of capital investments to a business; they need to incorporate it as part of their basic research into an investment opportunity. Often, companies will slow capital investment due to doubts about the economy or issues within a given segment of the economy. Investors, however, should make sure that such slowdowns are the result of larger economic forces and not a sign that a company is forgoing long-term investment plans so its financial statements can look better in the short term."

      "text": "It's a good idea to visualize what a company and a stock will look like in a year, because in essence, you are visualizing what another investor might be willing to pay for it then. In the case of Tesla (TSLA 6.18%), the range of possible outcomes is broad, and investors should consider it a high-risk but potentially high-reward stock. Here's what you need to know before buying the stock.\nTesla's fortunes depend on its robotaxi and unsupervised full self-driving offerings\nMost investment valuations for Tesla proscribe significantly more value to the company from its robotaxi and full self-driving (FSD) software (supervised and unsupervised).\nIn other words, while the electric vehicle business is critical to the company, it's not where most of the value lies. No one, except the most committed naysayers, values Tesla purely as a car company. It's a good idea to think of Tesla in a year in terms of the following considerations:\n- Tesla's electric vehicle (EV) deliveries have declined by 13% year over year for the last two quarters as relatively high interest rates make buying cars more expensive, and CEO Elon Musk has acknowledged that Tesla \"could have a few rough quarters\" due to the removal of federal EV tax credits.\n- Where will the robotaxi rollout be then, and what does it mean for the rest of the business?\nTesla's EV sales\nThe company's EV deliveries (equating to its sales volume, as Tesla sells direct to the consumer) are currently declining, and so is its market share globally and in the U.S. That said, there are some nuances in the sales figures that investors need to consider. There is a fascinating dynamic at play whereby Tesla is seeing a significant decline in its most popular SUV, Model Y, compared to its more sporty, but less expensive, sedan, Model 3.\nAccording to Kelley Blue Book EV automotive sales data, Tesla Model 3 sales/deliveries were up almost 38% year to date in the first half on a year-over-year basis. Interpolating the data shows that Tesla's U.S. sales, excluding the Model Y, were up 14.1% year to date in the first half on a year-over-year basis.\nThis fact makes it somewhat implausible that Tesla, at least in the U.S., is facing a buyer's strike due to Musk's political opinions, as it's hard to imagine why buyers would decide to avoid buying the Model Y but not the Model 3.\nThe reality is that Tesla's sales decline in 2026 is really a story of the Model Y decline, mainly due to the release of price-competitive EV SUVs, and a pause in sales as deliveries of the refreshed Model Y only started in March.\nNaturally, the company is aware of the price competitiveness issue, and it's not a coincidence that the new affordable model, set to be available in the fourth quarter, is just a Model Y, according to Musk, albeit it's likely to be a pared-down version.\nAll told, Musk has said Tesla could have a few rough quarters, and the removal of the EV tax credit is significant, and Tesla's Model Y refresh, at least on initial view, doesn't look like it's enough to turn sales around. On the other hand, Tesla will face easier sales comparisons for the Y next year, as the affordable Model Y is set to go on sale and interest rates might be lower.\nThere are a range of possibilities, but not all of them are negative. Perhaps the safest conclusion is that Tesla will still dominate the U.S. market (current EV market share in the mid 40% range). Still, its operating profit margin will remain under pressure (currently just 4.1% in the second quarter) as affordable models are likely to come with lower margins.\nRobotaxis and unsupervised full self-driving are the key\nOn the recent earnings call, Musk stated, \"I think we will probably have autonomous ride-hailing in probably half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year.\" And in the earnings release, the company noted \"Our purpose-built Robotaxi product -- Cybercab ... is scheduled for volume production starting in 2026.\"\nA snapshot of Tesla in a year could show the following:\n- A massively expanded robotaxi service, which in turn encourages sales of its FSD software and sales of Tesla vehicles (as buyers warm to the idea of potentially transforming their cars into robotaxis).\n- Tesla gearing up for the production of its dedicated robotaxi product, Cybercab, in 2026.\nTesla in a year\nA negative snapshot sees ongoing sales declines due to an aging lineup of cars, notably the Model Y, and a slow robotaxi rollout, and ongoing delays for regulatory approval of unsupervised, fully autonomous ride sharing (in this case, Tesla's unsupervised FSD). Musk thinks unsupervised FSD will be available in \"certain geographies\" by the end of 2025, but the doubters will point out his track record of being overly optimistic.\nA more positive scenario sees Tesla's sales growing again, with unsupervised FSD approved in some areas, robotaxi rollouts spurring EV and FSD sales, and Cybercab production around the corner, while Wall Street analysts are scrambling to pencil in assumptions for a long stream of explosive growth from robotaxi revenue sharing.\nThe answer lies somewhere in between the two, with the long-term potential from robotaxis/FSD making Tesla an attractive stock for risk-tolerant investors."

      "text": "Electric cars -- commonly called electric vehicles or EVs -- are automobiles with engines powered by electricity rather than gas. Electric car stocks comprise companies primarily focused on manufacturing electric cars. Companies that manufacture the components used in electric cars -- such as batteries or autonomous vehicle systems -- can also be considered part of the electric car industry.\nEven though all the major car companies, including Ford (F 3.44%) and General Motors (GM 3.17%), are developing and/or manufacturing at least one model of electric car, they're not usually considered electric car companies because their primary products aren't electric. The best electric car company stocks are generally companies focused solely on electric cars rather than traditional automakers producing primarily gas-powered vehicles.\nList of EV stocks\nElectric car stocks on the map\n| Company | Headquarters | Notable Models |\n|---|---|---|\n| Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) | Palo Alto, California | Model 3 and Model S sedans, Model X and Model Y crossovers |\n| NIO (NYSE:NIO) | Shanghai, China |\nET9 sedan, ES8 and ES6 SUVs, EC6 crossover |\n| Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) | Irvine, California | R1T truck, R1S SUV |\n1. Tesla: An industry leader\nAny list of electric car stocks should include the granddaddy of them all, Tesla. While BYD (BYDDY 3.63%) reported 2024 revenue of about $107 billion compared to the $89 billion that Tesla posted on the top line, Elon Musk's electric car company still demands respect as a force driving the EV industry forward after delivering almost 1.8 million vehicles in 2024. Most of the vehicles were Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossover SUVs, and the rest were Tesla's older, pricier models.\nDespite a tough macroeconomic backdrop, Tesla continues to aggressively expand production. Production is currently ramping up at Tesla's factories in Texas and Germany, and the company is building a new factory in Mexico.\nTesla has resorted to price cuts to sell vehicles this year as consumer demand faltered, a move that has hurt the bottom line. In 2024, Tesla's overall gross margin slipped by 39 basis points year over year to 17.9%, while its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin contracted slightly to 17% from 17.2% in 2023. The company is still profitable, but profits are trending lower.\nIn the first quarter of 2025, Tesla stock plunged 36% as investors balked at the company's weakening financials and expressed disapproval of Elon Musk's apparent distraction from leading the company due to his activities in Washington, D.C. But shares are still expensive by any measure. With a market capitalization currently topping $833 billion, Tesla stock trades at lofty price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios. The valuation makes the stock risky, but there's no denying the company is a leader in the electric vehicle industry.\n2. NIO: A Chinese SUV specialist\nChinese electric car maker NIO has been publicly traded since September 2018, but several initial public offerings (IPOs) by other Chinese electric car makers -- such as Li Automotive (LI 2.56%) and Xpeng(XPEV 4.4%) -- have increased investor interest in NIO.\nNIO is benefitting from strong customer demand in China. After reporting 221,970 vehicle deliveries in 2024 -- a 38.7% increase from 2023 -- NIO reported continued growth in the first quarter of 2025, reporting 42,094 vehicle deliveries in Q1 2025, 40.1% higher than the same period in 2024.\nAs to be expected, total vehicle revenue also rose. In 2024, NIO posted vehicle revenue of about $7.98 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 18.2%. In addition, NIO expanded its gross profit margin from 5.5% in 2023 to 9.9% in 2024.\nNIO further expanded its product line with the deliveries of the ET9 starting in March 2025, a vehicle that NIO characterized as \"a flagship smart executive sedan,\" on its fourth quarter 2024 conference call.\n3. Rivian: An up and comer\nInvestors were very excited about Rivian when the EV company went public in late 2021. It was one of the biggest U.S. IPOs ever, with the company raising almost $12 billion. Rivian's market value briefly topped $150 billion soon after its debut.\nRivian had barely delivered any of its electric trucks or SUVs when it went public, so investing in the stock was the ultimate leap of faith. The company managed to produce more than 1,000 vehicles in 2021, a tiny number compared to Tesla and other large automakers. Deliveries equaled 51,579 vehicles in 2024, and the company projects vehicle deliveries of 46,000 to 51,000 vehicles in 2025. The delivery outlook may be lower than 2024, yet it reflects the company's plan to pause production lines at its plant in Illinois for one month in late 2025 in preparation for the launch of production of the R2 in the first half of 2026.\nRivian is taking a risk by vertically integrating critical components like electronics, the propulsion platform, and software. The strategy may pay off if the company can rapidly grow production over the next few years, but it also means costs will be higher in the near term.\nRivian is driving closer to profitability. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Rivian posted its first quarterly gross profit of $170 million. Rivian has $7.7 billion in cash on its balance sheet, so it can afford to lose vast sums as it ramps up production. But if the company hits a roadblock, it could be in serious trouble.\nRevenue\nRivian stock dove 43% through the first six months of 2024, but it has shown signs of recovering in the second half of the year. The company is valued at just over $14 billion, which doesn't seem expensive relative to sales. A lot will need to go right, though, for Rivian to deliver for investors.\nOther EV companies\nOther companies in the electric car space\nBuilding a successful electric vehicle business is an expensive proposition, and the bankruptcies of Lordstown Motors in 2023 and Fisker in 2024 are good reminders that investing in this sector is inherently risky. After struggling with production issues, Lordstown and Fisker both ultimately filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nIf you want to diversify your portfolio exposure to the electric car sector and stay away from controversy, an alternative is to buy stock in any of these companies:\n- QuantumScape (QS 3.69%): Maker of EV lithium batteries\n- Blink Charging (BLNK 6.47%): Producer of electric car charging stations\n- Hyliion (NYSE:HYLN): Manufacturer of EV drivetrains\n- Luminar (LAZR 0.25%): Maker of autonomous driving technologies, such as Lidar\n- Ballard Power Systems (BLDP 6.61%) and Plug Power (PLUG 8.77%): Developers of hydrogen fuel cell vehicle technologies\nYet another option is to buy shares of Lucid Group (LCID -3.11%). After producing 9,029 vehicles in 2024, the luxury electric car maker projects significant growth, forecasting 2025 production of approximately 20,000 vehicles. Lucid delivered 10,241 vehicles in 2024, a 71% increase over that which it delivered in 2023.\nLucid raised about $4.2 billion in additional capital in 2024, which will help cover its losses as it scales up production. Lucid stock is pricey, valued at $7.75 billion despite 2024 revenue of $808 million, so investors should tread carefully.\nETFs\nElectric car ETFs\nInvestors seeking portfolio exposure to the electric car market who don't want to select individual stocks can buy shares in exchange-traded funds (ETFs). There are plenty of options when it comes to electric vehicle ETFs, including some that specialize in clean energy, which are often popular with ESG investors.\nFidelity Electric Vehicles and Future Transportation ETF (FDRV 4.18%) is a fairly small but focused choice and includes many of the stocks noted above. It also includes companies like Uber (UBER 2.62%), ON Semiconductor (ON 6.21%), and ChargePoint (CHPT 4.06%), adding to the diversification of the offering while remaining true to EV-enabling technologies. BYD is the largest holding at just more than 6.3%.\nThe Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF (PBW 5.43%), which tracks the performance of the WilderHill Clean Energy Index, invests broadly in clean energy. Although no single stock comprises more than 2% of the fund's holdings, the ETF owns the stocks of plenty of electric car makers. The stocks of NIO, Tesla, and Rivian are all held by WilderHill. The fund also owns shares of Blink Charging, lithium-ion battery maker Albemarle (ALB 3.04%), and Plug Power.\nThe Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV 3.61%) invests in makers of electric and self-driving cars. But the fund mainly focuses on traditional automakers making forays into this space, such as Toyota (TM 1.88%), and large tech companies, including semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA 1.65%) and Alphabet (GOOG 2.98%L) (GOOG 2.98%), which is developing autonomous vehicles.\nWhy the EV industry is different\nWhat makes the electric car industry different?\nThe electric car industry differs from the traditional automotive industry because it is so new. Until recently, very few companies manufactured any kind of electric vehicle, but every major automaker in the world is developing or producing an EV now.\nBecause major interest in electric cars is so recent, the only established industry leader is Tesla. Start-up EV makers can compete fairly well with traditional automakers for electric car market share, making it difficult to discern which companies will ultimately dominate the market. That unpredictability makes investing in the electric car industry riskier than adding portfolio exposure to the automotive industry as a whole.\nRelated investing topics\nFuture of EVs\nThe future of the electric car industry\nMultiple major automakers have recently adopted Tesla's EV charging technology, making it likely to become the standard in the U.S. This standardization should make purchasing and charging EVs simpler, which could help drive growth in the industry.\nMany companies participating in the EV sector are going public, while legacy automakers plan to release a plethora of electric vehicles over the next five years. Investing in this highly competitive and fast-growing industry is likely to be profitable, but it's important to take steps to minimize your investment risk. Don't invest in just one electric car company; hold positions in several companies of various sizes, and consider buying shares in an ETF.\nFAQ\nInvesting in Electric Cars FAQ\nWhich electric car stock is best?\nSince individual investing goals vary, there's no way to categorically say which EV stock is best. For those seeking a more conservative option, Tesla is a good fit since it has already achieved profitability. Investors more focused on growth, however, may find NIO and Rivian more compelling.\nWhat EV company is the next Tesla?\nWhile NIO is often recognized as the Chinese version of Tesla, Lucid has also received strong comparisons to Elon Musk's EV endeavor.\nWhat EV stock can I buy instead of Tesla?\nThere are numerous options for EV investors seeking alternative investments to Tesla. While NIO, Rivian, and Lucid are pure-play EV stocks that represent great options, investors looking to mitigate risk may feel more comfortable choosing an EV ETF.\nWho will dominate the EV market?\nBYD and Tesla are both industry leaders, but time will tell if they are able to maintain their commanding positions."
