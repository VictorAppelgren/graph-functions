  "description": "The best slasher films available to stream, including horror classics like Halloween and Scream.",
  "content": "\u201cHorror movie\u201d is such a broad term. You've got your supernatural films involving ghastly ghosts and demons, undead zombies, psychological mind-jobs, and \u201celevated\u201d cinematic horror, like that of Jordan Peele or Ari Aster, designed for more refined horror fans. As for me, I prefer slasher movies\u2014the ones where a psycho killer lets loose on a group of helpless victims, picking them off one at a time.\n\nIf you\u2019re a slasher fan, the problem is finding good ones to stream. Some of the best (like the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street series) aren\u2019t always available for streaming, and platforms like Netflix are littered with \u201cslashers\u201d so bad that Ghostface wouldn\u2019t clean his knife with them.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, though: I\u2019ve rounded up the definitive list of the best slasher films you can stream right now!\n\nHorror fans love to argue over which film began the slasher trend; for me, it all starts with John Carpenter\u2019s iconic 1978 film Halloween. After all, this movie introduced several staples of the genre, including a masked killer stalking young people. Among those young people is Jamie Lee Curtis, making her cinematic debut. This is the movie that arguably defined her career and crowned her as the first \u201cScream Queen\u2019 of modern cinema, and she would reprise this role many times across multiple films in this sprawling franchise.\n\nWhile Curtis and the rest of her young castmates add some much-needed humanity to the film, this movie is all about Michael Myers. His creepy mask is burned into the minds of everyone who saw this film, and his ability to stalk and slash his way through suburbia remains unparalleled. Special kudos also go to Donald Pleasence as Myers\u2019 doctor, a man who maintains (rightfully so) that his patient is no longer a man and has become the embodiment of pure and unrelenting evil.\n\nIn the \u201890s, the slasher seemed largely played out. Films featuring Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees had been delivering diminishing returns, and the tropes of the genre seemed just as dead as any onscreen killer\u2019s victim. But in 1996, Wes Craven\u2019s Scream turned the genre on its head, featuring a masked killer cutting his way through a group of teens who are almost painfully pop culture savvy.\n\nAs such, the film had a powerful dual appeal to both younger audiences (those closer in age to the onscreen victims) and older audiences (those who memorized the same horror tropes this film both lampoons and subverts). Charismatic cast members like Neve Campbell, Rose McGowan, and Matthew Lillard help bring the movie\u2019s hilariously quotable dialogue to life. Whether you love slashers for cool killers, fun victims, or memorable kills, Scream has a bit of everything.\n\nIt spawned a franchise of mostly solid sequels, but the original is still the bloody best.\n\nTo this day, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre stands out as one of the most demented horror films ever made. The intimidating killer Leatherface instantly became a pop culture legend thanks to his over-the-top design: who wouldn\u2019t be scared of a chainsaw-toting guy who wears the skin of others? While not as overtly scary, the rest of Leatherface\u2019s creepy cannibal family helped spook general audiences by underscoring the movie\u2019s grim message that unspeakable horror could be hiding within any unassuming house throughout the nation.\n\nAs a kind of proto-slasher, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre sets itself apart by keeping the audience on its toes. Like the characters in the film, we never know what is going to happen next. Every moment feels fresh and unpredictable, and the sudden arrival of Leatherface is still as vividly terrifying now as it was back in 1974. Even though the franchise started going off the rails with its later sequels, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is still the perfect film to show anyone who needs a good scare.\n\nSleepaway Camp is another movie that zigs whenever you expect it to zag. Its camp setting and bevy of young victims make it seem like this is going to be a clone of Friday the 13th. Unlike most of the movies featuring Jason Voorhees, though, this film spends plenty of time focused on the young attendees of the titular sleepaway camp. Plus (and I saw this as a guy with a Jason tattoo), the kills in this movie are way more creative than most of those doled out in Friday the 13th or other horror movies aimed at \u201880s kids.\n\nAnd while I won\u2019t spoil it, Sleepaway Camp has a deliriously unpredictable ending that is even more impactful now than it was decades ago. The youthful cast, led by veteran horror star Felissa Rose, is just great: they help to sell the naivete and innocence of youth and make the audience sympathize with their vulnerability. And I do mean vulnerable: unlike many later horror films, Sleepaway Camp doesn\u2019t hesitate to visit some very gruesome fates on its child characters!\n\nWhether you love or hate the character, Art the Clown has become the definitive horror icon of our modern age. Beneath some startling makeup, David Howard Thornton uses body language to infuse Art with a scarily surreal quality, like a killer cartoon come to life. Art is in rare form in Terrifier 2, a movie focusing on a teenage girl whose family lands in the monster\u2019s clownish crosshairs. If you\u2019re not familiar with the franchise, though, beware: the hallmark of the Terrifier series is gruesomely over-the-top kills, so this slasher sequel isn\u2019t for the squeamish.\n\nOne of the persistent criticisms of the original Terrifier movie is that it barely had a plot: we basically just watched Art stalk some poor women, and the script was little more than an excuse for some gory (and admittedly very, very scary) kills. Terrifier 2 addresses that criticism by giving our protagonist added agency and giving our antagonist some murky mythology. The narrative doesn\u2019t always make sense, but that hardly matters for audiences just looking for a scary good time.\n\nMost iconic slasher films focus on their monsters being obvious outcasts, which is why the genre is filled with masked or disfigured monsters hunting down hapless coed victims. American Psycho (adapted from the Brett Easton Ellis novel of the same name) subverts this trope by focusing on Patrick Bateman, a wealthy New York City investment banker. He\u2019s insanely handsome and obscenely rich, so there\u2019s no reason for him to become a killer. That\u2019s a big part of what makes this movie so scary, of course: the idea that the last person you would ever suspect may be hiding bodies inside a closet full of designer suits.\n\nThis movie adaptation adds some much-needed black comedy (it\u2019s honestly one of the best horror comedies ever made), which is one of the reasons that many of Bateman\u2019s quotes (from fretting over someone else\u2019s business cards to geeking out over Huey Lewis) have become beloved memes. As Bateman, Christian Bale steals almost every single scene, which is that much more impressive in a film with Hollywood heavyweights like Willem DaFoe. His charisma helps the film cast a kind of spell over the audience, inviting us deeper into a cinematic world so repulsive that it\u2019s almost impossible to look away from.\n\nX kicks off a trilogy of horror movies by Ti West that includes Pearl (still Mia Goth\u2019s greatest film) and MaXXXine. Each film has its charms, but X fits the slasher archetype best thanks to its plot. Set in 1979, the movie focuses on a group of young people trying to shoot an adult film. But the owners of their intended venue don\u2019t take kindly to what they are doing, and they are all too willing to kill these younger people for their transgressions.\n\nOn the surface level, X offers the blend of sex and violence fans have come to expect from slashers, and the period setting is enough to remind audiences of genre classics like Halloween and Friday the 13th. However, West uses these expected tropes as a springboard to offer crunchier commentary on everything from fame to old age. His performers (including franchise lead Mia Goth and genuine Scream queen Jenna Ortega) are more than up to the task, helping create a horror movie that makes you think when it\u2019s not making you squeal in fright.\n\nAs mentioned before, there is a constant debate over which film is the first slasher. While I will always maintain that the answer is John Carpenter\u2019s Halloween, you can make a fair case for Black Christmas, a holiday movie about a killer stalking the members of a sorority. As another kind of proto-slasher, the movie features familiar elements, including young victims, a mystery killer, and POV shots from the killer\u2019s perspective.\n\nSlasher fans enjoy Black Christmas for many reasons, including the intimate setting and the memorable kills. The movie is also notable for starring John Saxon, whom horror buffs may know best for his role in the Nightmare on Elm Street films. Additionally, the movie stars a pre-Superman Margot Kidder, which is great fun for anyone who ever wanted to see how Lois Lane might fare in a horror movie. While it\u2019s not exactly in the mold of later slashers like Friday the 13th, Black Christmas is a gift that just keeps on giving.\n\nLooking for a good slasher? It can be hard to find the ones worth watching, considering how many bad films are out there. Don't worry, though: each of these films is a real \"cut\" above the rest!",

      "text": "If you\u2019re an \u201880s kid, you know things were a bit different back then. It was a time when kids were free to roam the streets, and when they got home, they could watch the craziest stuff on television without their parents freaking out. Like horror movies.\nIn my case, that meant watching some iconic scary movies on cable, often hosted by the inimitable Joe Bob Briggs. And in the spirit of that legendary horror host, I\u2019ve brought you some vintage spooky movies that you can stream completely for free on Tubi. If you\u2019re ready for a night of entertainment that won\u2019t break the bank, check out these classic horror films on Tubi that \u201880s kids will love!\n10 Sleepaway Camp\n|\nRelease Year |\n1983 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 28 minutes |\nSleepaway Camp is the definitive slasher to show horror fiends who think they\u2019ve seen everything. On paper, this is a Friday the 13th-esque tale about a mysterious killer stalking the titular sleepaway camp. But the revelation of who the killer is and the wild secret they have been hiding will likely be burned into your brain forever, creating an ending that will (like the best scary movies) stick with you.\nThe kills in this movie are both vicious and visceral, and the dialogue effortlessly captures both the humor and the cruelty of teenage life. Felissa Rose gives a standout performance as our leading lady, and her character is often the perfect audience surrogate for the surreal events happening around her. Fair warning: some of those surreal events include a baseball game where the fashion choices are every bit as haunting as the film\u2019s gruesome kills.\n9 Slumber Party Massacre II\n|\nRelease Year |\n1987 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 17 minutes |\nSlumber Party Massacre II is the rare horror film that is unambiguously better than the original movie. The core story remains the same, focusing on some comely coeds who are being stalked by a killer with a drill. However, the original \u201cDriller Killer\u201d is now a greaser rockabilly dude with a murder weapon that doubles as a guitar! And for me, this rewrite of the impossibly lame bad guy from the first movie gives this sequel a surreal charm you just can\u2019t look away from.\nAs an added bonus, the sequel moves at a faster pace. The kills are more inventive, and there\u2019s an interesting plot thread about whether or not these brutal murders are simply in the main character\u2019s head. Oh, and did I mention the musical numbers? That\u2019s right: our unhinged villain is laying out tunes when he\u2019s not busy laying out bodies, and these killer tunes are worth streaming (and screaming!) for.\nDon't Wait for Halloween, Watch These Spooky Movies on Netflix Now\nSpooky Halloween vibes are just a click away with these scary Netflix films.\n8 Chopping Mall\n|\nRelease Year |\n1986 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 35 minutes |\nChopping Mall might be the most \u201880s horror movie ever made. That\u2019s because it takes place in a setting that modern kids would find pretty inscrutable: an indoor mall. And the bad guys aren\u2019t guys at all. Instead, they are creepy robots who look a bit like angry cousins of the Daleks from Doctor Who. You know, the kind of monsters that haven\u2019t really been that scary since the height of Beatlemania.\nIf the villains aren\u2019t that scary, though, what makes Chopping Mall worth watching? Mostly, it's pure, kitschy charm. The young cast (including horror icon Barbara Crampton) is extremely likable, and you\u2019ll quickly find yourself rooting for them as they fight for survival against an inhuman and utterly implacable foe. The kills are plenty of fun, and as an added bonus, the robot fights are cathartic fun for any \u201880s kid who, like me, worries about AI as a threat to humanity.\n7 Killer Klowns From Outer Space\n|\nRelease Year |\n1988 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 28 minutes |\nDescribing Killer Klowns From Outer Space is like describing a fever dream. The plot involves alien clowns who threaten a tiny town with hilarious-but-haunting hijinks. The only thing that can stop them is a handful of intrepid teens armed only with full hearts and an empty ice cream truck. The whole situation is made worse by a cop whose actor (John Vernon) is best known for playing the nefarious dean in Animal House.\nThe characters and off-kilter plot are quite appealing, but the real strength of this film is the threat of the titular Killer Klowns. With eye-popping makeup and gross-out practical effects, the Chiodo Brothers made these one-film villains from outer space some of the most memorable in all of horror history. And their kills (which include everything from cotton candy guns to deadly shadow puppets) help make each scene crazier than the one before!\n6 Hellraiser\n|\nRelease Year |\n1987 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 34 minutes |\nHellraiser begat a horror franchise that (hot take incoming) started losing the plot after the second movie. But the original is a scary movie masterpiece from Clive Barker with a plot about a woman willing to do anything to bring her undead lover fully back to life. She\u2019ll go to any lengths and sacrifice anyone, but that might not be enough to satisfy the extradimensional demon who put all of this grisly plot into motion.\nThis legendary horror film features standout performances from Andrew Robinson (best known as Garak from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine) and Doug Bradley as Pinhead, the spikey-faced leader of the film\u2019s pain-obsessed demons. Between his performance and his appearance, Pinhead became just as memorable as fellow monsters like Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. And beyond the performances, heroes and villains alike get great lines in this surprisingly quotable horror classic.\n5 Critters\n|\nRelease Year |\n1986 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 26 minutes |\nAt first glance, Critters looks like a Gremlins knock-off because it\u2019s about a band of creatures as mischievous as they are deadly. However, while Gremlins focused on chaos in suburbia, Critters brings its own band of over-the-top violence to the Midwest. Kansas isn\u2019t a flyover state to these aliens, especially when they crash near a farm and begin preying on the locals while trying to evade some erstwhile alien bounty hunters.\nCritters has a lot going for it: the Critter design is cool, the kills are creative, and the plot is a fun, seamless blend of sci-fi, horror, and comedy. Mostly, though, I recommend this film because it\u2019s what I call a great \u201cvibe movie.\u201d When you need a quick pick-me-up or just want to chill out, there\u2019s nothing quite like virtually hanging out at this farm while local residents get picked off by toothy monsters who can (Metroid-style) turn themselves into little balls when they need to move fast.\n4 Creepshow 2\n|\nRelease Year |\n1987 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 32 minutes |\nCreepshow 2 is a horror anthology with three distinct stories plus a wraparound tale. That makes it something of a spooky buffet, where audiences who want different things from their scary cinema can get a little bit of everything. The film has a great performance from George Kennedy, though true horror hounds will likely get a bigger kick out of special effects maestro Tom Savini starring in the film as The Creep, a kind of Cryptkeeper-type figure.\nSpeaking of true horror, this sequel is another team-up between Night of the Living Dead creator George Romero and literary legend Stephen King. Romero wrote the screenplay and deftly adapted King\u2019s short stories, and the author makes a brief appearance in the film. While some debate whether Creepshow 2 lives up to the reputation of the iconic original, I\u2019m a firm believer that the sequel can stand on its own.\nAdditionally, if you like this anthology format, be sure to check out the Creepshow series over on Shudder!\nHow Playing Scary Games Made Me Less of a Scaredy-Cat\nI used to avoid fear at all costs. Then horror games became my unofficial exposure therapy.\n3 C.H.U.D.\n|\nRelease Year |\n1984 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 36 minutes |\nC.H.U.D. is an acronym for the villains in this movie: cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers. And that basically sums up the plot, which involves a New York cop and a photographer teaming up to fight off a group of vicious underground mutants. In the best possible way, this film serves as the ultimate horror portrayal of a classic urban fear\u2014that an army of dangerous creatures lurks beneath the sewers, ready to pounce on the hapless humans below.\nIf you\u2019re a Home Alone fan (and who isn\u2019t?), the most surreal thing about the film is who plays two of the beefier roles. The erstwhile photographer is played by John Heard, who would later play Kevin McAllister\u2019s dad in Home Alone. Meanwhile, the reverend who runs a local homeless shelter is played by Daniel Stern, one-half of the Wet Bandits, also from the Home Alone movies. As it turns out, not even dealing with ravenous underground mutants was enough preparation to take on one precocious little eight-year-old a few years later.\n2 Little Shop of Horrors\n|\nRelease Year |\n1986 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 34 minutes |\nLittle Shop of Horrors is the rare schlock classic that hides some real heart beneath the plot about a man and his man-eating plant. Understandably, audiences mostly remember this movie for its bevy of guest stars (including Bill Murray, John Candy, and Steve Martin) and the unforgettable scenes of a plant that can\u2019t stop feeding on humans. But beyond these elements and some surprisingly catchy songs, there is a very heartfelt and genuine romantic story between the lovebirds played by Rick Moranis and Ellen Greene.\nMoranis plays a nerd who needs to come out of his shell, but feeding victims to his cannibal plant is two large steps in the wrong direction. Greene, meanwhile, needs to find the courage to leave an abusive relationship and embrace real stability. You\u2019ll soon find yourself rooting for these characters even as you ponder whether this love can, like the ravenous Audrey II, keep growing.\n1 Terror Train\n|\nRelease Year |\n1980 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 37 minutes |\nSometimes, creating a memorable new slasher is as easy as picking a memorable new setting. Terror Train takes place on a train in which a killer surgically slices up some pre-med students. But he keeps donning different masks, keeping both audiences and would-be victims (including Halloween legend Jamie Lee Curtis) on their toes.\nWhile the kills are fun, and the cameo from magician David Copperfield is memorable, the ultimate appeal of Terror Train is the train itself. It provides a novel setting while also isolating our characters, allowing them to be picked off, one by one. The plot itself also moves forward with the speed of a locomotive, proving that a story can\u2019t go off the rails if it never leaves the track!\nStrange horror films were a staple of every \u201980s kid\u2019s diet.

      "text": "The people who hate pineapple on pizza are crazy because mixing savory and sweet creates a killer taste. Every now and then, mixing two completely different things together creates something unforgettable. And that\u2019s exactly what happens when you mix my two favorite movie genres: horror and comedy.\nGood horror comedies make for some of the most entertaining films around, but it\u2019s tough to find ones that deliver the right amount of both spookiness and silliness. Fortunately, Netflix has some hidden gems, and here\u2019s a breakdown of their horror comedies guaranteed to make you both laugh and scream!\n11 Day Shift\n|\nRelease Year |\n2022 |\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 54 minutes |\nThere are more vampire movies out there than you can shake a stake at. Fortunately, Day Shift is a bloody cut above the rest, telling the tale of a veteran vampire hunter who has to return to his union to fund his daughter\u2019s expensive private school. Due to his notorious behavior, the union forces him to work the day shift, but this dead-end assignment heats up when he encounters a deadly new vamp with an old grudge.\nDay Shift has plenty of action and some fun creature effects that will impress even the most jaded fans of fang-filled films. But the real appeal is the easy chemistry between leading actors Jamie Foxx and Dave Franco. These two always keep the comedy light and crackling, which keeps the plot about a vampire union (which admittedly feels like a weak attempt at John Wick-style world-building) from ever getting too serious.\n10 The Addams Family\n|\nRelease Year |\n1991 |\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 39 minutes |\nNetflix\u2019s Wednesday show helped bring this kooky family back into the spotlight, so it\u2019s only fitting they\u2019re streaming the 1991 Addams Family movie. The plot involves a scummy family\u2019s attempts to pass off an impostor as the real Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd). However, his hilarious actions with Gomez (Raul Julia) may just reveal this bald baddie as the real McCoy.\nCampy, gothic humor drenches the entire film, and each character is perfectly cast. Aside from the mesmerizing male leads, there are standout performances from Anjelica Huston as Morticia and from Christina Ricci as Wednesday. Her iconic performance in this film and its sequel most certainly inspired Jenna Ortega\u2019s captivating performance in Wednesday.\nJust be warned: streaming this film means getting that catchy theme song stuck in your head for a week.\nDon't Wait for Halloween, Watch These Spooky Movies on Netflix Now\nSpooky Halloween vibes are just a click away with these scary Netflix films.\n9 Constantine\n|\nRelease Year |\n2005 |\n|\nRuntime |\n2 hours 1 minute |\nConstantine was an early example of Keanu Reeves making everything better. On paper, changing his titular ghostbusting detective from a snarky Brit to a grumpy American sounded dreadful to old-school comics fans. But Reeves quickly made the role his own, elevating the sillier plot beats and establishing a great rapport with costars Rachel Weisz and Shia LaBeouf. All in all, we are left with a film that appeals to any comic fans willing to give it a fair shake and those who are complete newcomers to this world of religious horror.\nOne standout performance comes from Tilda Swinton\u2019s Gabriel, an angel who sneers at what humanity has become. And I\u2019d be remiss not to talk up Peter Stormare, whose Lucifer is guaranteed to send chills up your spine. He steals every second of his brief appearance and even helps give this unconventional horror comedy an unforgettably epic climax.\n8 Thanksgiving\n|\nRelease Year |\n2023 |\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 47 minutes |\nI went into Thanksgiving thinking I would hate it. After all, it\u2019s a Scream copycat movie based on a Thanksgiving-obsessed killer, directed by gross-out horror maestro Eli Roth. Honestly, this sounded like it would be bad on multiple levels. To my surprise, though, Roth tones down his gory excesses and delivers the best masked slasher since, well, Scream!\nThere\u2019s a loose plot regarding the killings taking place one year after a Black Friday sales frenzy leaves multiple people dead and wounded. But Roth is less interested in critiquing capitalism and more interested in serving up seconds and thirds of red meat courtesy of a killer in a truly creepy mask. Throw in the fact that this movie stars both Patrick Dempsey and Addison Rae, and you have a horror comedy that, like Thanksgiving itself, brings multiple generations to the table.\n7 The Babysitter\n|\nRelease Year |\n2017 |\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 25 minutes |\nHorror is at its best when it keeps things simple. And it doesn\u2019t get simpler than The Babysitter, a film about a young boy left in the care of (you guessed it) his babysitter. But when she turns out to be a member of a Satanic cult, he suddenly has to use all of his brains and all of the resources in his own home to stay one step ahead of a cadre of completely amoral killers.\nThe Babysitter is basically Home Alone reimagined as a horror film. Young Judah Lewis does a great job playing the resourceful hero, and Samara Weaving gives a standout performance as the babysitter who is out for his blood. The zippy dialogue provides regular laughs, all while the action gives us one over-the-top kill after another.\n6 Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice\n|\nRelease Year |\n2024 |\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 45 minutes |\nBeetlejuice, Beetlejuice is a sequel that fans have waited decades to see. Michael Keaton reprises his role as the titular demon, and Winona Ryder returns to play Lydia Deetz once again. She\u2019s busy raising a teenage daughter (Jenna Ortega) and navigating a loveless relationship, but the return of her would-be groom, Beetlejuice, threatens to unravel the life she has spent decades trying to build.\nSpeaking of building, this spooky sequel engages in a surprising amount of world-building. We learn plenty more about the Netherworld and even about Beetlejuice\u2019s romantic past. The result is an uneven film that never reaches the height of the original, but I\u2019ll always have a soft spot for films where directors like Tim Burton aren\u2019t afraid to take a big swing.\nDon't Wait for Halloween, Watch These Spooky Movies on Netflix Now\nSpooky Halloween vibes are just a click away with these scary Netflix films.\n5 Vampires vs. The Bronx\n|\nRelease Year |\n2020 |\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 26 minutes |\nHorror films are filled with different kinds of heroes taking up arms against the vampires threatening them. Vampires vs. The Bronx changes things up by pitting the titular bloodsuckers against young children who will do anything to protect their neighborhood. Nobody will believe them about the threat, so they take things into their own hands, re-watching Blade to learn how to fight these demons (that\u2019s my kind of homework!).\nOlder horror fans will enjoy the fact that Vampires vs. The Bronx is a bit like Monster Squad for a new generation. For that matter, older audiences will also enjoy the cameo by Method Man, who (along with Zoe Saldana) gives this film some veteran presence. But the focus stays on the child actors, all of whom capably confirm to even the most jaded filmgoers that the kids are, in fact, alright.\n4 Little Evil\n|\nRelease Year |\n2017 |\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 35 minutes |\nAs a horror lover, have you ever asked yourself, \u201cWhat if The Omen was funny?\u201d Little Evil is a lighthearted film that answers that question, featuring two parents (Adam Scott and Evangeline Lilly) who worry that their son might be a little evil. When it turns out he\u2019s worse than anyone could have ever expected, they might have to do the unthinkable in order to save the world.\nDespite the somewhat apocalyptic stakes, this film keeps things breezy and funny. The core cast bounces off each other very well, and supporting actors like Donald Faison help to flesh out this quirky world. After the credits roll, though, you may never look at the creepy kids in your neighborhood the same way!\n3 The Munsters\n|\nRelease Year |\n2022 |\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 50 minutes |\nAfter delivering films like House of 1000 Corpses and the two Halloween reboots, the last thing anyone expected of Rob Zombie was that he\u2019d bring The Munsters back to life. But the director\u2019s passion shines through in a film that introduces these iconic characters to a new generation. How you feel about it, though, may entirely depend on how much you love the original show.\nZombie is clearly a fan of the source material, which is why he wrote a hit song about Herman Munster\u2019s sweet ride. And that passion is evident in this film\u2019s many scenes of hokey humor. The jokes may not be to everyone\u2019s taste, but this benefits from being the rare horror comedy adult fans can share with their children.\n7 Best Co-op Horror Games That Are Genuinely Scary\nYet, the game industry proved that it\u2019s not only possible to create co-op horror, but they can be just as, if not more, scary than singeplayer titles.\n2 Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire\n|\nRelease Year |\n2024 |\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 55 minutes |\nWhile Ghostbusters: Afterlife brought the franchise out of containment, Frozen Empire is an episodic adventure. Returning actors like Paul Rudd and McKenna Grace are joined by franchise newcomers Patton Oswalt and Kumail Nanjiani. However, it\u2019s not clear if everyone combined will be enough to stop a new threat that intends to freeze the entire city.\nAdmittedly, this sequel gets cluttered, especially when the original Ghostbusters make their token appearance. However, it has all of the heart of Afterlife while expanding this off-kilter world and bringing us a new generation of spectral exterminators. After all this time, I\u2019m pleased to report that busting still feels good and feels more like the franchise\u2019s classic cartoon."
