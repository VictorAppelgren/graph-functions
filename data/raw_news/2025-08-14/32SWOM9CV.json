  "title": "Ultra-processed foods that fuel colon cancer \u2014 and healthy alternatives that may offset the damage",
  "description": "Scientists have found a new link between diet and colon-cancer risk that could change how we fight the disease with more targeted treatments.",
  "content": "As colon cancer diagnoses are on the rise in younger people, researchers are discovering that certain foods may help or hurt our odds of developing the disease.A team of scientists from the University of South Florida and Tampa General Hospital Cancer Institute may have found clues in compounds called bioactive lipids, molecules that can increase or decrease inflammation in the body.In a study published late last year, the researchers analyzed more than 100 tumor samples from patients and found that they contained a higher proportion of these inflammation-causing compounds compared with healthy tissue.Previous evidence has linked increased inflammation to diets high in ultra-processed food, such as chips, sausages, packaged desserts, and refined carbs.As processed food takes up a growing share of the American diet (more than half, recent CDC data shows), a growing number of younger people are being diagnosed with colon cancer. It's now the second-leading cause of cancer-related death in the US.But inflammation isn't just a red flag that the body is under stress: tracking it can help doctors and scientists find ways to bolster the immune system against disease, slowing or stopping tumor growth by cutting back on inflammatory compounds and boosting healthy ones.For instance, the research team found that the tumors were lacking in molecules associated with healing and lowering inflammation.One source of these molecules is our diet, which includes foods such as leafy greens and seafood rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Eating more of these gut-friendly foods and fewer packaged meals may help keep inflammation at bay for better health.\"If the molecules are coming from processed food products, they directly imbalance the immune system and drive chronic inflammation,\" Ganesh Halade, a professor at the University of South Florida Health Heart Institute who coauthored the study, said in a press release. \"Our bodies are designed to actively resolve inflammation through bioactive lipid compounds derived from the healthy fats, like avocados, that we consume.\"While people who follow a \"clean\" diet can still get cancer, understanding the role of food could give us more tools to fight cancer.Cancer is like a \"chronic wound that won't heal,\" Dr. Timothy Yeatman, a professor of surgery at the University of South Florida who's the senior author of the tumor study, said in the release.A daily diet of ultra-processed foods can make it harder for the body to fight off tumors because of the increased inflammation, he said in a press release.In particular, foods that cancer doctors avoid include processed meats and sugary treats, both of which are linked to higher odds of illnesses, including cancer and cardiovascular disease.While it's not news that spinach and seafood are better for you than bacon and doughnuts, zeroing in on the link between food and inflammation unlocks more effective strategies to stave off disease in the future.For example, the Tampa General Hospital Cancer Institute has conducted early trials of a modified form of fish oil with promising results for reducing inflammation.\"This has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment, moving beyond drugs to harness natural healing processes,\" Yeatman said. \"It's a vital step toward addressing chronic inflammation and preventing diseases before they start.\"For now, one of the best ways to prevent cancer is to catch it early with routine testing. As far as eating your way to better health, evidence suggests your best bet is sticking to mostly whole, unprocessed foods such as veggies, fruits, legumes, lean proteins, and whole grains for a longer, healthier life.\"This has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment, moving beyond drugs to harness natural healing processes,\" Yeatman said. \"It's a vital step toward addressing chronic inflammation and preventing diseases before they start.\"In the meantime, there's evidence that your best bet for a longer, healthier life is sticking to a diet of mostly whole, unprocessed foods such as veggies, fruits, legumes, lean proteins, and whole grains.",
