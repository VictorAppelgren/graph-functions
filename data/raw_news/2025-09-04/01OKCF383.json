  "description": "Kate Middleton, who paid a visit to the Natural History Museum in London on Thursday, debuted a much blonder hairstyle - a move that sends a bold message, according to an expert.",
  "content": "Kate Middleton's new look is turning heads.\n\nOn Thursday, the Princess of Wales and Prince William paid a visit to the Natural History Museum in London. Kate, who wore a crisp white button-down under a fitted tweed blazer, was sporting a much blonder hairstyle \u2014 a move that sends a bold message, according to a royal expert.\n\n\"I love that Kate's new look isn\u2019t a \u2018full send\u2019 into platinum blonde territory; it\u2019s more of a \u2018bronde\u2019 moment. It's a soft transition that keeps her rooted in her brunette base (which the public knows so well) while testing out lighter tones,\" royal commentator Amanda Matta told Fox News Digital. \"That subtlety is part of the message: she\u2019s evolving her look without abandoning the image of stability and tradition people associate with her.\"\n\nKATE MIDDLETON'S NEW BLONDE HAIR MIGHT BE MORE THAN JUST A STYLE CHOICE, EXPERT SAYS\n\n\"Going blonder can still be read as a nod to contemporary trends, but because Kate hasn\u2019t gone all the way, the look still balances with royal tradition,\" Matta continued. \"Kate has been embracing less fussy silhouettes, more relaxed tailoring, and now, a lighter, fuller hairstyle. These choices read as confidence-building and restorative, almost therapeutic.\"\n\nMatta said the transformation almost feels like \"a conscious investment in herself, reclaiming visibility after illness and presenting strength.\"\n\n\"Royals have long used their wardrobes and appearances as a kind of visual language, and hair is no exception. By going lighter, Kate signals freshness and renewal without the shock value of a drastic transformation,\" said Matta. \"It\u2019s a way of saying she's back on the scene for fall, but she's adapting to a new normal. This was the perfect moment to debut this new look! The children's school year is starting, the summer break is behind them, and it\u2019s a natural point to re-engage the public. A noticeable hair refresh not only gives her a personal boost after a tough year, it also makes people tune back in.\"\n\nKATE MIDDLETON RETURNS TO ROYAL DUTIES DAYS AFTER REVEALING SHE IS CANCER-FREE\n\nIn 2024, Kate appeared to shift her hair to warmer honey-colored tones, and by April of this year \u2013 timed with her and William\u2019s 14th wedding anniversary \u2013 she debuted an even lighter shade during a royal trip to the Isle of Mull.\n\nAt Wimbledon in July, her golden highlights seemed brighter still.\n\nBritish psychologist Carolyn Mair, Ph.D., told Fox News Digital that Kate may want to feel \"brighter and more energetic\" and said hair is a part of our identity.\n\n\"Hair is our crowning glory and a symbol of health and femininity,\" Mair said.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\n\"Kate might want to make a fresh start by embracing a lighter outlook on life,\" the psychologist added.\n\nIn March 2024, the princess revealed in a video statement that she had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy.\n\nBy September, she announced she was cancer-free, describing the nine-month ordeal as \"incredibly tough\" for her family, but said that it left her with \"a renewed sense of hope and appreciation of life.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhen it comes to bold hair changes, Kate appears to be taking a page from the late Princess Diana\u2019s playbook.\n\nIn 1990, during a photoshoot with Vogue, hairstylist Sam McKnight asked Diana how she would like her hair styled.\n\nAccording to The Daily Mail, she replied, \"What would you do if I gave you free rein?\"\n\nAfter McKnight suggested cutting it short into a modern crop, Princess Diana said, \"Let\u2019s do it.\"",

She later asked to have her hair cut into a crop - That was one of the cuts that women suddenly wanted - you saw it everywhere\nThis shot of Diana in a white ballgown (above left) was taken in 1990, when I was working with the French photographer Patrick Demarchelier.\nI\u2019d been told we were shooting someone important for Vogue, and guessed it might be Margaret Thatcher \u2014 and then the Princess walked in.\nI faked a short style for the shoot, using hair grips to tuck her shoulderlength hair under the tiara.\nAfterwards, she asked me: \u2018What would you do with my hair if I gave you free rein?\u2019 Feeling brave, I said: \u2018I would cut it all off.\u2019\nShe was convinced immediately.\n\u2018Let\u2019s do it,\u2019 she said. So I cut it off there and then. I had no idea what was about to ensue. The style became frontpage news and there were journalists camped outside my parents\u2019 house \u2014 they had to move out for two weeks.\n'I saw Diana every week when I was in London \u2014 we\u2019d often watch Channel 4 soap Brookside at the palace together while I was doing her hair and I went on a number of her official trips', says Sam McKnight, pictured\nThat was one of the cuts that women suddenly wanted. You saw it everywhere \u2014 on the High Street, on newsreaders \u2014 it was a real counterpoint to big Eighties hair, part of a sportier, more androgynous look, but, because it was Princess Diana, it was still hugely feminine.\nI saw Diana every week when I was in London \u2014 we\u2019d often watch Channel 4 soap Brookside at the palace together while I was doing her hair and I went on a number of her official trips.\nShe was fascinated by my work with supermodels and asked if she could meet Linda Evangelista and Liz Tilberis, Vogue\u2019s editor at the time. I got a cafe in Knightsbridge to open specially for the meeting.\nDiana would have been mortified if she\u2019d known, so Liz got Vogue staff to pretend to be customers.\nLinda, Liz and I discussed the private shoot that Diana had done earlier that week with me and Patrick Demarchelier, and how one shot would make a great Vogue cover.\nIn the end, this iconic image of her in a black turtleneck with short hair, resting her chin on her hands, was the cover in December 1991. She had just stopped biting her nails and was so proud of how they looked!\nMonkeying around with Linda\nThis was at the height of supermodel Linda Evangelista\u2019s fame in 1992 (with me on the left). It was a shoot for fashion brand Kenar, on location in LA - Jesse the chimp was perfectly trained\nThis was at the height of supermodel Linda Evangelista\u2019s fame in 1992. It was a shoot for fashion brand Kenar, on location in LA.\nJesse the chimp was perfectly trained \u2014 I put a wig on him, and that\u2019s how the picture came about! I once styled Linda for a shoot that saw her chased by a dozen Dobermans.\nHer mother was there, clinging to me in terror, but all Linda cared about was which diamonds the photographer wanted at the forefront of the frame \u2014 the earrings or the bracelet!\nNaomi: big attitude, bigger hair\nNaomi Campbell was so sweet and beautiful. In this Nineties shoot for a jeans ad campaign, rather than restraining her hair, I gave her a huge hairpiece that was as big as her personality\nI met Naomi Campbell when she was only 16. For her first shoot, she arrived on the bus in her school uniform and said her mother didn\u2019t know she was here, so we had to be quick!\nWe took one look at her and booked her straight away. She was so sweet and beautiful. In this Nineties shoot for a jeans ad campaign, rather than restraining her hair, I gave her a huge hairpiece that was as big as her personality.\nShe can be naughty, dangerous and unpredictable, but I love her to bits.\nGel? No, Coke and sugar!\nWith this 1993 look, I wanted to take Cindy Crawford away from the all-American big hair she\u2019s known for \u2014 and she rose gamely to the challenge of this side-swept, masculine style\nWhen this picture was taken, Cindy Crawford was just about the most famous model in the world.\nWith this 1993 look, I wanted to take her away from the all-American big hair she\u2019s known for \u2014 and she rose gamely to the challenge of this side-swept, masculine style.\nBack in those days, there wasn\u2019t anything like the number of products we have today \u2014 we used a solution of sugar and water, or even Coca-Cola, to get hair to stay put! It would have been utterly impractical in real life \u2014 you\u2019d have wasps buzzing around \u2014 but, for shoots, it was perfect.\nUma's screen goddess style\nWay before Uma Thurman was an actress, we worked together a lot \u2014 she was just 22 for this shoot, for German Vogue in 1992, and two years away from her \u2018big break\u2019 in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Pulp Fiction \u2014 for which her harsh dark bob was such a bold change from her natural blonde\nI\u2019ve known Uma Thurman since she was 16 and a tall, gangly schoolgirl.\nWay before she was an actress, we worked together a lot \u2014 she was just 22 for this shoot, for German Vogue in 1992, and two years away from her \u2018big break\u2019 in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Pulp Fiction \u2014 for which her harsh dark bob was such a bold change from her natural blonde.\nAround this time, we were on a photoshoot and, just for fun, I threw her in a swimming pool. What I didn\u2019t know is that she was wearing a pair of Manolo Blahnik shoes! I always said I\u2019d replace them, but I never did \u2014 perhaps I\u2019ll have to now I\u2019ve admitted it.\nKate the very salty girl\nWe flew to St Barts for three days and the airline lost my luggage with all my kit, so I had to improvise. I found a spray bottle at the hotel, filled it with sea water and used that, along with a bit of backcombing, to give Kate a beachy Bardot look\nKate Moss and I have now done 30 Vogue covers together \u2014 including this shot, which was taken by photographer Nick Knight. But there was one that almost went awry. We flew to St Barts for three days and the airline lost my luggage with all my kit, so I had to improvise.\nI found a spray bottle at the hotel, filled it with sea water and used that, along with a bit of backcombing, to give Kate a beachy Bardot look. You couldn\u2019t tell and, indeed, salt sprays became a popular way of getting a beachy look a few years later!\nKim the chameleon\nKim Kardashian is a beautiful woman, and the ultimate professional.For this shoot, we sprayed her all day with water and put her in front of a wind machine: she didn\u2019t flinch\nI\u2019ve only worked with Kim Kardashian twice.

      "text": "Prince William, born William Arthur Philip Louis, is the Duke of Cambridge, a member of the British royal family, and first in line of succession to the throne. He is the first son of King Charles and the late Diana, Princess of Wales. He married Catherine Middleton in 2011 in a highly televised wedding at Westminster Abbey in London, watched by nearly 40 million people in the UK and tens of millions more around the world.\nPrince William and Kate Middleton, who began dating in 2003, parent three young children; Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis. William is considered one of the more popular members of the British royal family, alongside his late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. He has one younger sibling,Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex. His mother Diana died in 1997 during a car crash in Paris. Since the tragedy, William and his brother have organized memorial services dedicated to their mother.\nWilliam received his formal education at Wetherby School, Ludgrove School, and Eton College. He holds a Scottish Master of arts degree in geography from the University of St. Andrews. During the Iraq War, William and his brother both showed a desire to serve in the British military, with the Duke of Cambridge enrolling in the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst. However, military officials stopped him because terrorist groups would specifically target him, putting his life and fellow soldiers' lives in danger. The prince eventually finished the training to become a helicopter pilot in the RAF and reportedly completed 150 operations before ending his military career in 2013.\nWilliam's royal duties and responsibilities included representing the Queen on many occasions at religious and charitable engagements. He is involved with non-profit campaigns for mental health awareness and efforts to end the illegal sale of wildlife."
