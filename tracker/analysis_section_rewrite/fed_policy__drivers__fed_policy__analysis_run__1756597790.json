      "feedback": "Your draft captures the Fed‑rate/term‑premium link to the S&P 500 but it is overly verbose, mixes multiple assets (DXY, mortgage rates) without clear causal hierarchy, and repeats the same source IDs. Tighten the narrative to a single causal chain: Fed policy → 10‑yr yield → term premium → mortgage rate → tech valuation compression → S&P 500. Remove all non‑essential side‑bars (e.g., 30‑yr yield, 2‑yr/10‑yr spread) unless you can map them to a distinct handle that materially alters the outcome. Replace generic “high concentration of tech names” with a quantified risk: top‑10 techs account for ~35 % of S&P 500 cap; a 10 % earnings drag could force a 4–6 % index pullback (cite FAN5RYW6T). Explicitly state the magnitude ranges for each leg: Fed cut → 3–5 % upside; sticky inflation → 5–10 % downside. Anchor the catalyst window to July CPI/PCE (ID B1KYJ1GPU) and September Fed meeting (ID 3YAQ8JUPL). Add a brief fragility note: if DXY > 96.5 or 10‑yr yield > 4.6 %, the upside collapses. Ensure every claim has a single, relevant ID and that the paragraph stays within 3–4 sentences. This will satisfy the “truth > verbosity” rule and provide a defensible, actionable view.",
