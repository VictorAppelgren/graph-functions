      "feedback": "Your draft is fact‑rich but too verbose, repeats the same causal chain, and lacks the concise, handle‑mapped, catalyst‑anchored style required for a PM brief. Condense to 4–6 bullet‑style sentences (or a single paragraph of 4–6 sentences) that explicitly state: (1) the base‑case pullback of –5 % to –10 % in spx over 3–6 months if September 5 payrolls confirm a slowdown; (2) the counter‑case +2 % to +5 % if payrolls stabilize and the Fed holds; (3) the causal chain for each case (payroll → Fed cut → 10‑yr yield ↓ 15–20 bp → DXY ↓ ≈ 200 bp → equity discount ↓ 30 bp → spx movement), citing IDs (FAN5RYW6T, XTQIQRP5K, 3YAQ8JUPL, Z7O1DCHS7, B1KYJ1GPU, 97MD1FHW8); (4) the key risks (sticky core PCE > 2.5 %, tariff‑driven cost inflows, tech earnings weakness) with handle mapping to spx, ust10y, cpi, core_pce; (5) the watch signals (Sept 5 payrolls, Sept 16‑17 Fed minutes, July 30 CPI, early‑Aug tech earnings) each linked to a handle. Remove redundant paragraphs, ensure every claim has a citation, and replace vague “confidence moderate” with a quantified risk weight (e.g., 60 % probability of the base‑case). This will satisfy the handle‑mapping, catalyst‑window, and concise‑style requirements.",
