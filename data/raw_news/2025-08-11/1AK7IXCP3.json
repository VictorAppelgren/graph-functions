  "title": "Franklin Templeton: Japan Deal Shows Auto Sector is Key",
  "description": "Christy Tan, Investment Strategist at Franklin Templeton Institute, says Japan's trade agreement with the US shows that deals can be reached when both countries want one badly. She adds that the deal shows how important the auto sector is in trade talks. She speaks with Yvonne Man and David Ingles on \"Bloomberg: The China Show.\"  (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "We're starting to get more frameworks, at least in this part of the world, on what these trade deals are going to look like with the US. Has our frame your investment strategy overall as we count down to the rest of the year now. Hi, good morning. Yes, I think we've seen now the low hanging fruit which is the US Japan trade deal that's been plugged. Right. So it also showcases that, you know, when both countries wanted a deal as equally badly and this was evidenced by you know, these US Japan parks being like the eighth or the ninth round before a deal actually came into materialization. So, you know, this goes to show that, you know, if that kind of premise will probably lead to a proper deal or at least a framework. So we have 15% tariffs and Japan promising, which is half a trillion dollars of U.S. goods, and Japan increasing access to American producers of cars, trucks, rice and agri products as what Trump is claiming. Now, the surprise as well is the ten percentage point reduction from the original Liberation Day tariffs. So what it also means for markets is that we we think that, you know, this auto tariffs pot is probably going to be a key swing factor or a key influence. You know, it'll be interesting to see how EU auto tariffs will pan out. Right. And Trump also striking a deal with the Philippines, 90% tariffs overall. These and more trade deals ahead. What this means for markets is that it reduces the risk of countries having to mention or impose retaliatory measures post August 1st. And as we are also watching very closely, is the deal with China before the August 12 deadline. And now we're talking about an extension. So there's still some time. And I think essentially it puts the risk on bull markets in the meantime. Well, in the meantime, Kristie, let me pick up on that, because as you point out, markets are welcoming this news positively. If you take a step back, though, you notice the tariff levels have been creeping up, right? Japan's at 15%. Southeast Asia, we're closer to 20%. We weren't even at 10% six months ago. The markets in six months time look back at this time and say that was actually a negative for these markets. Well, I think the markets have been pricing in some some of some part of tariffs. Right. So it's either between 10% or 20%. I think that's the kind of threshold and the range that markets are putting it. Of course, if you compare with, you know, the base, which is very low single digits, then we are definitely was off. But I think there is already the adjustments being put in markets, in the premium, in, you know, in either share prices or bond yields that are pricing in some form of tariffs. Now, are we going to be worse off? And that remains to be seen, because as we are looking at right now, is the start of a trade deal and the proof is in the pudding because whether or not this gets carried out and I think that this US Japan trade deal, if you look at, you know, the promise of half a trillion dollars worth of US goods purchases from Japan, you know that is leverage, right? So at the end of the day, I think that will be a lot more negotiated negotiations. And the actual impact either on prices, on inflation remains to be seen. But, you know, we are definitely was all compared with low single digit. But, you know, we are not worse off better off if, you know, if it's below 20%. Your Japan call overall, Kristie, you're saying, you know, the market is still a good value play. You know, obviously before this trade deal, you were already saying that. And despite all this kind of political uncertainty that's going on in the country. So what is the play on Japan now? Well, we have been bullish on Japan for some time, and I think this is definitely holding up. And we have we have seen, I think, the political situation and also the tariff issues being a disruption. And but overall, I think the fundamentals in Japan remains right and we are seeing reforms being being maintained and companies are delivering. And also the wage rises, although is still negative, real wage, but at least we are looking at wage increments. That's happening and inflation is a problem domestically. And I think with the political focus and priority by ishiba now is probably the survival, right. And he has to address the domestic issues. So we do expect that. I think the main issue about Japan is, of course, the hurdle on debt and fiscal rights. And this is not common. This is not just in. In particular Japan. Right. Everyone is facing that 90 200% debt to GDP, of course, is big. But at this point in time, you know, we we do think that, you know, there are more positives that and fiscal issues are definitely a long term issue that Japan has to deal with. But in the near term, the policy reforms that corporate reforms that are taking place and inflation being tackled, these are some of the positives that we continue to see value in Japanese companies that are, you know, reporting positive earnings and valuations are not as fresh as the others. Well, others, but potentially, I'm not sure if you're alluding to I mean, United States. Right. I mean, the market's doing well, some stocks better than others. It's quite a narrow rally taking place. Are you concerned over valuations in the U.S.? Where do you think the S & P 500 is going to be this time next year? That's a great question. So we do have a survey by our portfolio management analysts and, you know, all nearly 500 of them. And the consensus is that the S & P 500 for this year will end around, you know, nearly just 56,000 and around 5550 900. Now, there are reasons why we are more, I would say, conservative, you know, for the rest of the year, for this year. But, you know, the long term medium run is still for the S & P 500 to hit higher. Now, in the meantime, then, you know, you've mentioned. Right, you know, valuation, right. That's extended. So what's the game plan for the second half? You know, we are looking at a correction, a consolidation, at least a healthy pullback sometime between August and October. We still have a few event risks ahead of us. Right. And markets had a strong run. Right. So we are looking at rotation and this rotation is bringing us to some other markets that could be quite interesting, underappreciated. And you're looking at China, unusual markets that have been also doing pretty well only recently. So I think we are expecting that rotation to move out of US equities, some of the overvalued ones potentially into some of the better prospects type of, you know, we are looking at companies with better balance sheets and this is the earnings season, the second quarter earnings season. Yeah, looking quite decent. Well they hold a rate of 4% is pretty easy to beat. So we are looking at more positive earnings surprises. But it is it is still is a well extended markets in terms of you know, valuation and pricing so rotation and broadening of the markets that's what the next.",
