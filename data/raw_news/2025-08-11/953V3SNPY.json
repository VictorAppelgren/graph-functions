  "content": "The bet365 bonus code WEEK365 will secure a $150 bonus for new users to play on MLB's biggest games this week, including Phillies vs. Reds tonight.\n\nThe bet365 bonus code WEEK365 will secure a $150 bonus for new users to play on MLB's biggest games this week, including Phillies vs. Reds tonight.\n\nGet up and running with the bet365 bonus code WEEK365 to lock in $150 in bonus bets or a $1,000 first bet safety net for Monday's MLB games and more. Lock in the offer you prefer when you create an account and bet on games like Phillies-Reds, Red Sox-Astros or Padres-Giants.\n\nScoring this offer is easy: just click here.\n\nThe bet365 welcome offer gives you the unique ability to choose between the two rewards when you start your account. These promos can be used to bet on any game across bet365.\n\nThe Phillies-Reds game is significant for the National League playoff picture. The Phillies are trying to distance themselves from the New York Mets, while the Reds are trying to chase them down. The Red Sox-Astros series comes just a week after Houston was swept in a three-game series at Fenway Park. Both teams currently hold playoff spots. The Padres currently hold a wild card spot, while the Giants are clinging to postseason hopes at this point in the season.\n\nBet on any of these games to activate your desired reward with the bet365 bonus code.\n\nThe $150 bonus offer is popular for new users, so let's go through that first. You just have to place a $5 bet on any market to activate it. The outcome of that bet does not matter, and you will receive your bonus bets before your initial wager settles.\n\nSo, you could bet $5 or more on the Phillies to beat the Reds tonight and receive your $150 in bonus bets right away. Any kind of market will work for this offer, just make sure your initial bet is at least $5.\n\nWith the $1,000 first bet safety net, you will be able to bet up to that amount and get your stake refunded if your bet loses. As an example, a $750 bet on the Phillies to win gives you the chance to secure a large cash payout. A losing bet will trigger a $750 bonus refund to your account.\n\nIf baseball is not your thing, a bet on the Sun-Valkyries WNBA game or even an NFL Preseason game later this week will activate your preferred offer.\n\nClaiming this offer from bet365 is simple. Just follow the steps listed below:\n\u2022 Click here or on any other link to get started\n\u2022 Provide basic personal information (name, date of birth, mailing address, phone number, email address, etc.)\n\u2022 Use secure payment method for initial deposit (credit card, debit card, online banking, PayPal account, etc.)\n\u2022 Make first bet to activate $150 bonus offer or use $1,000 first bet safety net\n\nAny bonus bets you receive with either offer will be valid for one week before they expire.\n\nOne of the best parts of the bet365 app is the boosted bet specials you can find for several sports. There are plenty of opportunities available for tonight's MLB games:\n\nNewsweek may earn an affiliate commission if you sign up through the links in this article.
