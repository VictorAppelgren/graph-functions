  "description": "Facebook is trying to make 'pokes' the new streaks.",
  "content": "Technically, the poke never really left Facebook.\n\nThe classic feature from Facebook\u2019s early days lets users get a friend\u2019s attention with a virtual nudge of sorts. While the poke fell out of use ages ago, the company has more recently seen an uptick in its use among younger users, which has now prompted it to make the poke a more central part of the Facebook experience.\n\nNow, users are able to poke their friends from a new, dedicated button directly on their Facebook profile, which will alert the poke\u2019s recipient through their notifications. In addition, Facebook users can see who poked them and find friends to poke at facebook.com/pokes. On this page, users will be able to track their \u201cpoke count\u201d with friends, which grows every time they poke each other. They can also dismiss pokes if they don\u2019t want to reciprocate.\n\nThe poke-tracking feature is largely designed to appeal to younger users who have grown up with gamification elements built into their social apps, like Snapchat and TikTok streaks. These features ostensibly help friends keep track of those they message most, but streaks have come under regulatory scrutiny and have even led to lawsuits because of their addictive nature, as they keep kids hooked on the apps.\n\nBy highlighting poke counts and making the poke more prominent on Facebook, Meta wants to create a similar engagement mechanism. As users increase their poke counts with a friend, different icons will appear next to the friend\u2019s name, like a fire emoji or \u201c100,\u201d among others.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time in recent months that Facebook has tried to revive the poke. In March 2024, the company said it had made it easier for users to find the poking page via search and would make it easier to poke a friend after searching for them. These small changes led to a 13x spike in poking in the month after the changes, Meta said at the time.\n\nAs for why you\u2019d want to poke someone, that\u2019s up to users to decide. Facebook never explained the purpose of the poke, leaving it open to interpretation. A poke could be a way to catch someone\u2019s attention, flirt, or just annoy them, depending on the user\u2019s intent.\n\nPoke counts may never become as popular as streaks, but adding them is clearly a signal that Meta is looking to boost Facebook engagement.\n\nAccording to research from Jon Haidt, author of \u201cThe Anxious Generation,\u201d which focused on social media\u2019s potential harm to children\u2019s brain development, Snap had known about streaks\u2019 habit-forming nature for years. An article he co-published with a senior research scientist at NYU Stern, Zach Rausch, included quotes from internal documents that show Snap employees discussing how popular streaks were and how effective they were at driving engagement.\n\nThough Facebook today remains a cash cow for Meta\u2019s business, fueling its longer-term bets in areas like AI and metaverse projects, it has long been criticized for failing to appeal to younger users \u2014 a demographic that\u2019s been declining, particularly in the U.S. The company has tried to recapture the youth market with various initiatives, including the short-lived, college-only feature, Facebook Campus, shuttered in 2022, and more recently, a Gen Z-focused redesign.",

If you message with someone in a direct message or a group chat for 3 days in a row, a Streak badge displays on the chat. You also have the option to manage a Streak Pet with someone through direct messages. The Streak grows as you or other group chat members continue to exchange messages. The badge fades if messages aren't exchanged before the day ends. If there's no interaction in the chat for 24 hours after it fades, your Streak ends and the badge disappears. However, you may have the option to restore an expired Streak depending on how long you've been messaging for. You'll be notified when you receive a Streak or if your Streak is about to end.\nWhat is a Streak Pet?\nA Streak Pet is a virtual character that you can maintain with another person as long as your chat has an active Streak. After you earn a Streak badge, you can send or receive invites to unlock a Streak Pet. Complete various tasks to gain growth points and manage your Streak Pet in your direct messages.\nA few things to know about Streak Pets:\n\u2022 This feature isn't currently available everywhere.\n\u2022 While you need an active Streak to unlock and maintain a Streak Pet, you don't need a Streak Pet to keep a Streak active.\n\u2022 If your Streak ends, we'll remove the Streak Pet for both people in the chat and your growth points will return to zero. However, you may have the option to restore your Streak.\n\u2022 If you or the other person remove the Streak Pet while the Streak is active, we'll remove it for both people in the chat and the growth points will return to zero.\nHow to manage Streak notifications\nYou can manage Streak notifications from your settings in the TikTok app.\n1. In the TikTok app, tap Profile at the bottom.\n2. Tap the Menu \u2630 button at the top, then select Settings and privacy.\n3. Tap Notifications.\n4. From here:\n\u0f1a Turn the Streaks setting on or off for push notifications.\n\u0f1a Tap In-app notifications, then turn the Streaks setting on or off.\nHow to restore a Streak\n1. Go to the chat that lost the Streak.\n2. Tap Restore within the chat, then tap Restore again.\nA few things to know about restoring Streaks in direct messages and group chats:\n\u2022 This feature isn't currently available everywhere.\n\u2022 If you're under 18 years old and join a group chat, your message won't count toward unlocking or restoring the Streak. Learn more about group chats on TikTok.\n\u2022 You can only restore your Streak within 48 hours after it ends. If you don't see an option to restore your Streak, the time frame for restoring it has passed.\n\u2022 As you maintain your Streak, you get a limited number of restores at a time.\n\u2022 If you previously had a Streak Pet, the pet will return to the chat where you restored your Streak.\n\u2022 After a Streak is restored, it'll return to the same number of days that you lost. For example, if you lose a Streak on day 11 and it's restored, the badge will display 11 days.\nHow to manage Streak Pet invitations\nTo invite someone to manage a Streak Pet:\n1. In the TikTok app, go to the chat of the person you want to manage a pet with.\n2. Tap the Streak badge at the top. Keep in mind that you must have an active Streak to unlock a Streak Pet.\n3. Tap the Streak Pet, then tap Invite.\nTo accept an invite to manage a Streak Pet:\n1. In the TikTok app, go to the chat that sent you an invite.\n2. Tap Accept.\nHow to manage your Streak Pet\n1.

      "text": "Snapchat under scrutiny from MPs over 'addictive' streaks\nThe firm behind instant messaging app Snapchat has told MPs it may consider changes to its friendship streaks, which have been criticised for being potentially addictive.\nStreaks are used as a mark of a close friendship within the Snapchat app.\nIt involves friends exchanging messages but each response must arrive within 24 hours. Some Snap users juggle dozens, or even hundreds, simultaneously.\nSnap executives told British MPs they would \"revisit\" the feature.\nMPs from the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee are exploring the addictive nature of social and gaming platforms.\nStreaks are created within Snapchat if two users have exchanged messages for more than three days in a row. The longer they continue, the greater the streak.\nSome youngsters ask friends to sign into their accounts if they can't, in order to maintain their total.\nAge verification\nSnapchat's senior director of public policy, Stephen Collins, and Will Scougal, Snap's creative strategy director, downplayed their significance, saying they were part of a suite of features introduced in 2015 and not an integral part of the app.\nBut committee chairman Damian Collins compared streaks to likes on Facebook and re-tweets on Twitter.\n\"It seems that the value of a relationship could be measured in the length of a streak,\" he said, asking whether parents who felt that they were putting \"undue pressure\" on their children could remove them.\nNo, said the executives, but both promised to \"take the thoughts of the committee on board\".\n\"Streaks were meant to be a fun thing. We have reduced them in size by 30%, in line with recommendations from the Children's Commission, but we are always looking at whether we should sunset a particular feature and we will revisit it,\" said Snap's Stephen Collins.\nThe firm also faced tough questions about how it makes sure that children under the age of 13 are not joining the platform.\nOne MP said he had joined the app easily despite supplying a date of birth that indicated he was 12 years old.\nMr Collins acknowledged that it was \"not possible to keep under-13s off any platform\" because they can easily get around parental controls.\n\"We need a robust age verification system and we are working with the Home Office on this,\" he told MPs.\nIn response to the hearing, Tony Stower, head of child safety online at charity the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Children (NSPCC) said: \"We know that 18% of eight to 11 year olds have a social media account, and yet social networks still fail to build child safety measures into their platforms from the start. Dealing with it after harm has taken place is simply too late.\n\"It is evident that tech firms will not do enough if left to their own devices, and so it is vital the government holds its nerve and brings in new laws and an independent regulator to police the Wild West Web and force social networks to introduce a range of protections to keep their young users safe.\"\nThe firm was also asked about a phenomenon of \"Snapchat dysmorphia\" in which filters and lenses alter body and facial features.\nThe executives were asked if they felt they were part of a growing conversation about whether such systems were encouraging young girls to have body issues and even depression.\nThey said the filters were \"a fun way\" of overlaying reality and that \"more research was needed across the whole industry\" on the societal effects of beauty apps and filters.\nUnreleased data\nSnapchat's involvement in the high-profile and tragic case of Breck Bednar, a 14-year-old boy who was murdered by Lewis Daynes after making friends with him on a gaming website, was also under scrutiny.\nSnapchat has faced media criticism for failing to provide data to police investigating claims that the murdered boy's family received messages via the platform which graphically recounted the killing.\nThe messaging firm said it would take a year for police to get this data because the firm is based in the US and therefore bound by an agreement known as the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty.\nMr Collins told the committee that Snap had been asked by Kent police about its policies but had never formally been asked to release any data.\nIt said it had spoken to Breck's family about how to report and block content and how to preserve data for any future police investigation.\nIt also said it had advised them on resetting their accounts and not accepting friendship requests from people they did not know.\nAsked whether Snap could have made an exception and given police the relevant data had they asked, Mr Collins said he would have to check with Snap's legal team."

      "text": "Facebook was much in the news last week, although you may not realise that because it has been renamed Meta in the hope the bad vibes associated with its maiden name would gradually fade from public memory. (Google tried the same stunt with Alphabet and that hasn\u2019t worked either.)\nFor a change, though, Facebook\u2019s latest moment at the top of the news agenda had nothing to do with scandals and everything to do with its financial results, which were so unexpectedly bad that the shares dropped 25% at one point, taking $240bn (\u00a3177bn) off its market value, which in turn led to a 2% drop in the Nasdaq index.\nGiven that Facebook has hitherto been a licence to print money, so much so that at one stage (in 2019), when it was fined $5bn by the Federal Trade Commission, its shares actually went up as Wall Street registered that the ostensibly massive fine was actually the equivalent of a fleabite on an elephant.\nBut this time was different. Why? Three factors stood out from reports of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s conference call with stock market analysts: the impact of TikTok; Apple\u2019s move to require iPhone users to consent to being tracked by advertisers; and the revelation that the hitherto unstoppable growth in the number of Facebook users has stalled.\nZuckerberg\u2019s newfound obsession with TikTok must have puzzled many observers. After all, TikTok is not a social network. It\u2019s a service that hosts short-form user videos, from genres such as pranks, stunts, tricks, jokes, dance and entertainment. It is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, is understood by nobody over the age of 40 and has taken the world by storm. As a form of Chinese cultural imperialism, it makes Xi Jinping\u2019s belt-and-road initiative look amateurish.\nSo why is it keeping Zuckerberg awake at night? The answer is that TikTok caters brilliantly to a demographic group \u2013 so-called young adults \u2013 that Facebook, with its ageing demographics (parents and grandparents), doesn\u2019t seem to serve well any more. This explains its zeal to re-energise Reels (its ludicrous attempt to mimic the short-video genre) and to reprioritise young adults in its other offerings. But the real problem for Facebook is that TikTok is monopolising its users\u2019 attention, which is where the money for surveillance capitalism comes from.\nAs Ben Thompson, the veteran tech analyst, puts it: \u201cThe problem for Meta is that its business isn\u2019t based on surfacing content from your friends; it\u2019s based on engagement and serving ads, which means any service that occupies your time and attention \u2013 and TikTok occupies a lot of it \u2013 is a fundamental threat.\u201d\nThe second source of woe for Facebook is the impact of Apple\u2019s \u201capp-tracking transparency\u201d (ATT) feature, introduced last year with version 14.5 of its iOS mobile operating system. This required iPhone users to give explicit consent for user-level and device ID-based monitoring by apps. Not surprisingly, users declined in droves. And the impact for Facebook has now become clear \u2013 in the form of $10bn in lost advertising revenue. That\u2019s 8.5% of the company\u2019s 2021 revenues, but, more significantly, a quarter of its overall profit for the year.\nIt\u2019s easy to see why results like these might lead investors to reconsider their stock portfolios. But Facebook has had wobbles before and recovered. As a company, it has vast resources of cash and talent. Given time, it might be able to find a way of luring young adults away from TikTok and of navigating round Apple\u2019s ATT. But for anyone who takes a longer-term view of these difficulties, the big story is that the company\u2019s user base may have stopped growing. The figures revealed last week show that the number of daily active users fell by 500,000 and that the numbers of monthly active users seems to have levelled off at 2.91 billion. If this is the beginning of a trend, it\u2019s really significant.\nWhy? Basically it\u2019s all about network effects. Way back in 1990, Bob Metcalfe, the co-inventor of Ethernet, formulated a \u201claw\u201d that says the value of a communications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system. This law has driven every networking system on the planet and harnessing it has always been the goal of company founders.\nThe trick was to attract users quickly (by not charging for services) and to get to the point where user numbers are big enough to make it very difficult to break into the market. Facebook reached that point long ago and if you want a measure of its power at the moment, try working out what the square of 2.91bn is.\nThe reason the network effect is so powerful is that as long as the number of users is increasing, the company is riding a virtuous circle. The more users it has, the greater the incentive for new users to sign up. From the beginning, driving growth in the number of users has been Zuckerberg\u2019s overriding obsession. It\u2019s why he has always turned a tin ear to the voices of caution when the company ran into scandals and charges of causing societal damage.\nBut network effects work both ways. If user numbers start to decline, then the virtuous circle suddenly turns vicious, leading to a downward spiral. Maybe this is what TikTok is already doing to Facebook\u2019s Instagram, for example. Zuckerberg is smart enough to know his position as master of the current universe may be transitory. Sic transit gloria and all that. Which may explain why he plans to be master of the coming metaverse.\nComments (\u2026)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

      "text": "Facebook attempted a return to its roots as a college-focused social network with the fall 2020 launch of Campus, a private section within Facebook that was only open to those with an @.edu email address. However, the initiative didn\u2019t succeed, as Facebook is now alerting users that Campus will fully shut down on March 10.\nThrough an in-app message, Facebook is informing users that its Campus pilot will close down and that Campus profiles, groups, posts and other data will be deleted. Ahead of its shutdown, users will be able to view their data and download it using an export tool, the message noted.\n\u201cSince we launched the Campus pilot, it\u2019s been our mission to help bring college communities closer together. But we\u2019ve learned that the best way to support students is through Facebook Groups,\u201d the message explains.\nSocial media consultant Matt Navarra told TechCrunch he had been alerted to the closure by several Campus users and posted a screenshot of the message to Twitter. Other Campus users had also noted the planned shutdown and the accompanying plans to delete the data. But very few had commented on the loss \u2014 an indication, perhaps, of Campus\u2019 lack of traction.\nFacebook is shutting down its Campus feature on March 10 pic.twitter.com/DUCmVu9Eup\n\u2014 Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) March 2, 2022\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nOriginally, Facebook had presented Campus as a way to appeal to make the social network appealing to younger people by offering college students a private place where they could connect with classmates, join groups, learn about upcoming campus events, get updates from their school\u2019s administration, and chat with others.\nWith the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was also a sense that Facebook could potentially capitalize on the fact that many students had shifted to virtual learning to drive adoption of its online college network.\nHowever, Campus was not offered as a fully separate app \u2014 it was accessible from the \u201cMore\u201d section alongside other Facebook verticals, like Watch, Dating, Gaming, News and others. This may have made it feel more like a part of Facebook itself, rather than a truly private network.\nFacebook had marketed the feature on its platform \u2014 sometimes too aggressively, users complained. One Twitter user in 2021 remarked how they were being pushed to join Campus, even though they were faculty, not a student, for instance. As of mid-2021, the feature had become available to 60 total U.S. colleges and universities, after 30 more schools were added to the service. And even as early as this January, Facebook Campus expansions were underway as local outlets were reporting school additions, as with UNC Charlotte, for example.\nCurrently, the pilot program has 204 schools on board, Facebook told TechCrunch.\nA company spokesperson noted the original idea for Campus came about because students were already using Facebook Groups for their college, and Facebook wanted to explore if a dedicated product could better serve this use case. But ultimately, Facebook realized Groups worked better.\nThe spokesperson also confirmed the decision to shut down Campus, noting:\nWe\u2019ve decided to end our pilot of Facebook Campus. We learned a lot about the best ways to support college students, and one of the most effective tools to help bring them together is Facebook Groups. We\u2019ve notified students in the test schools that Campus will no longer be available, and have suggested relevant college Facebook groups for them to join."

      "text": "Facebook wants to woo more younger users to join its social network, instead of spending all their time on TikTok, Instagram, and other social apps. To do so, parent company Meta on Friday announced a series of changes to the older social network which will put greater emphasis on local community information, videos, and Facebook Groups, among other things. Other Facebook products, like Meta AI, Facebook Dating, and Messenger are receiving updates as well.\nMost notably, the emphasis of Facebook\u2019s redesign, announced today at a Facebook IRL pop-up event in Austin, will be partly on its entertainment options \u2014 a move meant to rival apps like TikTok. The changes will also focus on the more practical offerings Facebook provides users in a local community. Beyond buy/sell groups, the site has become a key staging ground and communication hub for other local groups, like those impacted by natural disasters, as is currently the case in states impacted by Hurricane Helene. (Due to climate change, these types of disaster response groups will likely become more common, too.)\nThe updates come as the Facebook brand is in decline, which led the company to rename itself Meta in 2021, shifting its focus away from its top social app and onto the metaverse instead. Facebook\u2019s user base has been growing older, and younger people haven\u2019t been signing up in great numbers to create a new generation of users.\nThat\u2019s particularly true in the U.S. According to data from the Pew Research Center only 33% of U.S. teens are now on Facebook as of last year, down from 71% of teens in 2014.\nStill, Meta is hopeful because it found that young adults, particularly 20-somethings, have been using the site for certain features, like Facebook Groups and Marketplace, for instance. The New York Times even covered the latter, as an example of how Facebook was being used by the next generation as a place to thrift shop, not to socialize.\nToday\u2019s series of updates capitalize on these trends by making Facebook more approachable for those wanting to connect with their local community or be entertained, rather than as a friend-focused social network.\nNew Facebook Features\nFor starters, Facebook is introducing a new tab called \u201cLocal,\u201d which will pull in local content from across places like Marketplace, Groups, and Events into a single section. Here, users will find things like nearby activities, local groups offering items for sale or for free, local recommendations about new neighborhood hot spots, and more.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $600+ before prices rise.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nThe tab will initially only be available in testing in select U.S. cities, including Austin, New York City, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Chicago, Charlotte, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, and Phoenix.\nIn addition to the Local tab, a user\u2019s local community will be highlighted in other ways on Facebook. A new, swipeable section will appear in the user\u2019s Facebook Feed (formerly, News Feed) which will showcase interesting posts and information from the area. This may include things like local events, local Facebook Groups, notable people or businesses, items for sale on Marketplace, and more.\nThe social network is introducing a new \u201cExplore\u201d tab as well, focused on personalized recommendations. This section will be powered by an algorithm that will surface not just content that entertains, but those that will connect you to interests, even if they\u2019re narrowly defined. As an example, Facebook says users might find things like tips for traveling abroad for the first time, DIY tricks for repurposing furniture, or running groups for marathon training, among other things.\nThe Explore tab will also gain a prominent place in the redesigned app, becoming the fifth button on the bottom navigation bar on iOS (top bar on Android), and one that\u2019s directly in the center of the app.\nClicking through will take you to a page that looks a lot like Pinterest or ByteDance\u2019s Instagram/Pinterest competitor, Lemon8, which has been growing in popularity among younger users thanks to its promotion on TikTok. The page will be split into two sections, a \u201cFor You\u201d feed and one focused on \u201cNearby,\u201d or more local content.\nIn terms of entertainment, the Video tab on Facebook will be updated in the weeks ahead to offer a full-screen video player that will allow users to watch short-form, long-form, and live videos in one place. This will give reels a more prominent place on Facebook, the company notes, and it reflects the use of video by younger users. On Facebook, young adults spend nearly 60% of their on the app watching videos, and more than half of them are watching Reels daily, Facebook points out.\nFacebook Events and Groups are being updated too.\nFacebook Events will also receive an upgrade by offering users both a Weekly and Weekend Digest of upcoming events based on their interests. These will come via a Facebook notification, the company says.\nUsers will also be able to invite Instagram followers to events created on Facebook, as well as via SMS and email invites to those who have not registered an account on the site.\nA new AI feature is coming to Facebook Groups, too. The \u201cGroup AI\u201d offering will help members of groups find answers to questions \u2014 including those that have previously been asked. This addresses one of the bigger headaches for Group admins, who find that new people joining the group typically ask the same questions again and again. The feature will have to be enabled by a Group\u2019s admin, which then introduces a chat-like interface where Group members can ask questions and be linked to relevant group posts. The test is currently rolling out in the U.S. and Canada.\nThe Groups update in particular targets a major area of Facebook for the next generation, as Groups now attract 1.8 billion users, and 25 million public groups are active every month, Meta notes.\nIn addition to making Groups\u2019 content easier to find on a per-group basis, Facebook\u2019s search results will also organize content from groups in a section titled \u201cWhat people in groups are saying.\u201d\nMeanwhile, still hoping to build a space for online dating now that dating apps are pass\u00e9, Facebook Dating will add a \u201cMatchmaker\u201d feature that will allow up to 5 friends to swipe through potential matches for you. The company says this feature was introduced because the company saw that Facebook Dating conversations had increased 24% year-over-year among young adults in the U.S. and Canada.\nOther AI updates and new Messenger features\nOverall, the changes across Facebook aim to make the network more appealing to the next generation of users, who use the site in a different way than the young adults who first joined the site in their youth, and are now approaching middle age. That includes embracing new technology, like AI.\nA Meta AI-powered \u201cImagine Yourself\u201d image-generation feature is being integrated into Facebook\u2019s Feed, Stories, and on the user\u2019s profile page, as previously announced.\nPlus, AI comment summaries \u2014 appearing across public Groups, Pages, and Creators \u2014 have been rolled out. (We\u2019d argue that they aren\u2019t that useful, though, and detract from one of the more engaging Facebook experiences \u2014 scrolling through crazy comment sections!)\nRelated to today\u2019s news, the Notes feature from Messenger, which lets you share your current status in a bubble above your profile, will arrive on Facebook, initially as a test. Messenger\u2019s Memories feature, which resurfaces photos from past chats, is also beginning to roll out.\nMessenger will additionally gain a new Communities feature, similar to WhatsApp, focused on letting people connect via their shared interests. These will offer an alternative to Facebook Groups and will include a shareable QR code for joining.\nThe changes also follow this week\u2019s launch of a new monetization program for creators that lets them earn more from content formats across Facebook."

      "text": "Snapchat is Harming Children at an Industrial Scale\nIn their own words, we see that Snap Inc\u2019s design choices expose millions of kids to harm\nIntroduction\nOn October 1, 2024, investigative journalist Jeff Horwitz reported a startling statistic from an internal Snap Inc. email quoted in a court case against Snap Inc., the company which owns Snapchat. The email noted that the company receives around 10,000 reports of sextortion each month\u2014and that figure is likely \u201conly a fraction of the total abuse occurring on the platform.\u201d\nThis statistic prompted us to investigate what else Snap Inc. knows or believes about the impact of its product on users, particularly teens (We estimate that roughly 13 million American 13-17 year-olds use Snapchat). Over the past several months, we have examined multiple court cases filed against Snap Inc., many involving severe or fatal harm that was (allegedly) facilitated by Snapchat\u2019s features. From 2022 through 2025, as part of the Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) and Judicial Council Coordinated Proceedings (JCCP) against social media defendants, more than 6001 such lawsuits specifically named Snap Inc. as a defendant. In addition, state attorneys general from Nevada and New Mexico have brought significant cases against the company\u2014two cases which we will draw heavily from in this post.\nFollowing the format of our previous post about the \u201cindustrial scale harms\u201d attributed to TikTok, this piece presents dozens of quotations from internal reports, studies, memos, conversations, and public statements in which Snap executives, employees, and consultants acknowledge and discuss the harms that Snapchat causes to many minors who use their platform. We group these findings into five key clusters of harms:\nAddictive, Compulsive, and Problematic Use\nDrugs and Guns\nChild Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), Sextortion, and In-person Sexual Predation and Assault\nCyberbullying\nKnowledge of Harm and Underage Use, and Lack of Action\nSimilar to TikTok, we show that company insiders were aware of multiple widespread and serious harms, and in many cases did not act promptly or make substantial changes. As Snap\u2019s director of security engineering said regarding Android users who are selling drugs or child sexual abuse material on Snap:\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine it\u2019s been broken for ten years we can tolerate tonight.\u201d2\nWith regard to sextortion on the platform, one employee had complained in a private channel:\n\u201cGod I\u2019m so pissed that were over-run by this sextortion shit right now. We\u2019ve twiddled our thumbs and wrung our hands all f\u2026ing year.\u201d3\nThe briefs allege that the company is also aware of rampant underage use, and of the ineffectiveness of their age gating process. Snap executives have admitted that Snapchat\u2019s age verification system\n\u201cIs effectively useless in stopping underage users from signing up to the Snapchat app.\u201d4\nAlthough the evidence below is all publicly available, no one has compiled and combined direct quotations from company insiders and internal reports across multiple alleged harms. We think this compilation gives vital information to parents, who might want some insight into the business practices of a company that hosts their children\u2019s social lives, owns much of their attention, and influences their social development.\nAt the start of each section, we highlight a real-life example\u2014drawn from relevant court documents\u2014illustrating the specific harm in question. Each child\u2019s story offers a human perspective on the broader statistics and quotations that reveal the far-reaching harms discussed within the company.\n1. Our Conversations with Snap, Inc.\nWhile working on this post we had four conversations with Snap\u2019s leaders and employees during which we asked them about some of the harms that appear in the various briefs. In three of those meetings, we asked specifically about the claim, taken from an internal Snap email that was quoted in the New Mexico brief, that Snap gets 10,000 reports of sextortion each month. We did not get any rebuttals or explanations of that claim.\nSnap\u2019s Trust and Safety team made a point that we think is valid and important for readers to keep in mind: the briefs we are drawing from present the allegations of one side in litigation, and there is often another side. Some of the quotations may have been misinterpreted or taken out of context. Snap\u2019s Trust and Safety team pointed us to a motion Snap made to have the New Mexico case dismissed. We read that brief and found that it contested only a few of the many claims made in the New Mexico brief. Two of these claims had been in our list of quotations, so we cut one from the post below, and we added a comment to the other.\nSnap\u2019s Trust and Safety team also shared various measures they take to mitigate harm to children and teenagers. The Trust and Safety team said that child safety is their top priority and they told us that they proactively remove significant amounts of harmful content. In Snap\u2019s motion to dismiss they state that Snap has \u201cdoubled the size of its Trust and Safety team and tripled the size of its Law Enforcement Operations team since 2020\u201d which has \u201cimproved Snap\u2019s ability to act quickly when Snapchat users report harassment or improper sexual content on the platform.\u201d\nWe have no doubt that Snap does remove large quantities of harmful content from its platform, or that they are trying to remove even more. However, it is difficult to assess whether Snap is solving 5% or 75% or 99% of the problem since its metrics focus on the number of pieces of content removed rather than the percentage of Snapchat users who experience harm on the platform. Even if Snap were to remove a billion pieces of drug or sex related content each year, many teen users may still encounter such content every day. And any teen who wants to buy drugs may still find it easy to find dealers, as has happened in many tragic cases of fentanyl poisoning, including very recent cases. Many may still report seeing sexual content, as there are many ways for users to be sexually explicit without violating policies.\nFrom a parent's perspective: if you were choosing which summer camp to send your teen to, would it be reassuring to learn that a camp used to remove 100 sharks a month from its coastal swimming area, but now they remove 500 a month? Probably not reassuring at all. As a parent, you\u2019d much prefer a camp that put its resources into prevention\u2014such as by putting an effective shark barrier around the swimming area\u2014rather than one that focused on catching sharks more quickly after campers report seeing their fins.\nWe also had the opportunity to discuss many of our observations about Snapchat\u2019s features with both their leadership and their trust and safety teams. We appreciated their willingness to engage with us. We suggested to them some design changes that we believe would make the platform less addictive and less harmful:\nRemove the Quick Add feature5 for minors, which is one of the main ways that adult predators and drug dealers get access to teens.\nRemove the streaks feature,6 which causes many teens to send photos to each other compulsively, needlessly increasing their time on the app.\nRemove beauty filters for minors\nRemove engagement-based algorithms, at the very least, for underage users.\nStop deleting posts on Snap\u2019s own servers. The fact that Snap does not store the content of conversations (beyond a limited period) is helpful for drug dealers, sextortionists, and others with criminal intent, but it does not improve the user experience of most children to know that even if something goes terribly wrong, their conversations cannot be discovered by law enforcement officers.\nDo a lot more to remove underage users. Snap is widely used in middle schools. (A 2021 survey by Common Sense Media reported that 13% of 8 to 12 year olds said they had \u201cever used\u201d Snapchat. We therefore estimate that in 2021 in the U.S., about 2.7 million children ages 8 to 12 had used Snapchat.)\nOne broader request we made was to collaborate on publicly accessible user experience research that could help quantify and reduce the harms we describe below. It would be important to know precisely what percentage of kids receive unwanted advances on their platform, or know how to access drugs - which are very different questions from the ones that they generally answer publicly. Such assessments have been called for by company whistleblowers and public health experts.\nWe remain hopeful that Snap will act on some of these requests. Nonetheless, we decided to move forward with this post because whatever safety improvements have been made in recent years, and whatever improvements Snap says it will make in the future, we believe it remains essential for the public to understand the dangers associated with Snapchat, as expressed by Snap\u2019s own employees and consultants, who are quoted in numerous court documents that have emerged in recent years.\nWhile the company has clearly made efforts to address some of these concerns, transparency about their past actions and insider beliefs about the platform's impact are critical for those of us trying to understand: how did we get here? What on earth happened in the early 2010s such that there is now an international youth mental health crisis, increasing evidence of attentional fragmentation and declining functional intelligence, and countless cases of severe harm\u2014from fentanyl-laced drugs bought on Snapchat to suicide after sextortion that began on their platform.\nThe quotations we give below indicate that the harms that occur on Snapchat (as with TikTok and Instagram) are so vast that even a highly dedicated trust and safety team that removes hundreds of millions of pieces of harmful content cannot prevent millions of children from being exposed to serious harms on their platform. This is why design changes are so urgently needed. Better content moderation is not enough.\nHere\u2019s a simple way to determine whether an online platform is safe for kids: Does it connect children to anonymous unverified adult strangers? If so, then a great variety of harms are likely to ensue, and parents should be wary of letting their children use that platform until the company makes very substantial design changes.\n2. What We Have From Snap\nWe draw primarily from Attorney General Raul Torrez of New Mexico who released a 165 page narrowly redacted complaint against Snap Inc. on October 2, 2024. We also draw on internal evidence from The State of Nevada\u2019s Complaint by Attorney General Ford and Co., as well as the civil action second amended complaint, Neville et al. v. Snap.\nWe have created an annotated version of each of the three briefs (New Mexico, Nevada, and Neville et al.)7 so that you can see each selection we chose in the context of the rest of the brief.\nThere are also a variety of smaller individual and class action lawsuits which address how specific features of Snapchat caused specific harms on individual minor users. Though we do not rely on these for internal quotes from the companies, they offer testimonies of families who have been harmed by the platform.8\nIn the rest of this post, we organize the evidence of harm that is currently available to us, taken directly from employees and leaders within Snap Inc. and from reports that they commissioned.\n3.

Snap P. 117-124, PARA 481-517: Jack McCarthy got his first phone at 12 years old, and opened a Snapchat account without his parents\u2019 knowledge or consent. Jack\u2019s use of Snapchat \u201ccoincided with a steady decline in his mental health.\u201d Jack became \u201clocked into Snap\u2019s social media product, as intended, causing him to feel like he couldn\u2019t sleep without it.\u201d When his parents tried to limit his access to Snapchat, Jack \u201cbecame agitated\u2026 He would become visibly panicked and irrational, willing to do and say anything to get his device back.\u201d Although Jack\u2019s sleep and anxiety worsened, he would claim his \u201cinsomnia\u201d would be made worse if his phone was not at his side. After years of Jack\u2019s declining mental health and increasing dependence on the Snap platform, Jack obtained drugs through an anonymous dealer on Snapchat who had added him through Snap\u2019s Quick Add and mapping features. Jack was found dead on his family\u2019s kitchen floor on the morning of September 25, 2021.\nOn March 22nd, 2025 we corresponded with Jack\u2019s mother via email. She explained that \u201cJack died from fentanyl poisoning not an overdose. Jack took one pill which unbeknownst to him contained fentanyl\u2026 Enough fentanyl to kill four people. Jack never stood a chance.\u201d\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.\nInternal Evidence\nNew Mexico (NM)\nNM P. 111, PARA 273\nIn January 2017, an internal email titled, \u201cSnap streak distribution first look\u201d highlighted several comments from Snap employees concerning Snapstreaks:\n\u201cWow, we should add more addicting features like this.\u201d\n\u201cThink it would be interesting to investigate how healthy Snapstreak sessions are for users\u2026 If I open Snapchat, take a photo of the ceiling to keep my streak going and don\u2019t engage with the rest of the app, is that the type of behavior we want to encourage? Alternatively, if we find that streaks are addictive or a gateway to already deep engagement with other parts of Snapchat, then it would be something positive for \u201chealthy\u201d long term retention and engagement with the product.\u201d\n\u201c70% of our DAU visit the app everyday, but only 22% have streaks going.\u201d\n\u201cMost streakers are our core demographic.\u201d\n\u201cWe should answer at the highest level, whether streaks are a by-product of high engagement or a driver of it. My hunch is that it starts off being the former, but eventually becomes the latter - and we should figure out when that magical transition point occurs.\u201d\nNM P. 112, PARA 27610\nA December 2018 presentation titled \u201cUnderstanding the Consumer and Snapchat Discover\u201d outlined findings from online surveys and focus groups. The summary noted, \u201cStreaks have become pressure filled\u2026\u201d and included data on users\u2019 fear of missing out (FOMO):\n\u201cAs the true digital natives, Gen Zs see their mobile devices as an extension of themselves, and while this allows constant access, it also creates constant pressure. There is never a break from the very real FOMO that exists.\u201d\n\u201cRespondents in groups and via social media diaries expressed that if they\u2019re not constantly checking social media they felt they were \u201cmissing\u201d things (content, communications from friends, news, etc.).\u201d\n\u201c45% of Snapchat Users 13-17 use Snapchat \u201calmost constantly\u201d\n\u201c41% of Snapchat Users 13-17 use Youtube \u201calmost constantly\u201d\n\u201c34% of Snapchat Users 13-17 use Instagram \u201calmost constantly\u201d\nNM P. 113, PARA 278: In October 2019, a presentation acknowledged that \u201cStreaks make it impossible to unplug for even a day\u201d and that \u201cMaintaining Streaks and keeping up with conversations\u2026 causes pressure,\u201d which, heightened by notifications, can be stressful: (Fig. 42)\nNevada (NV)\nNV P. 24, PARA 63\nDisruptive use of Snapchat in the classroom was no surprise to Defendants.

After an October 2019 news article described Snapchat's popularity with drug dealers, Snap\u2019s Communications Director complained internally that while the company was \u201cpushing back fiercely on the claim that illegal content was particularly bad on Snapchat\u2026 from what we can see, drug dealing\u2014both buying and selling\u2013 has increased significantly.\u201d She noted that dealers use Stories, which are recommended through Snap\u2019s Discovery feed or set to allow communication with \u201cEveryone\u201d to \u201camass a huge amount of subscribers\u201d with a \u201clack of repercussions\u201d. While an account may be deleted if it is reported, \u201cit is not necessarily device blocked, meaning accounts pop right back up. Nor is there any threat to the account being reported by law enforcement,\u201d which complains about the \u201cdifficulty of apprehending bad actors on our platform.\u201d\nPARA 228: Indeed, later that year, meeting notes confirm Snap's recognition that \u201csome bad actors prefer to transact on Snapchat given the ephemerality of communications on our platform.\u201d\nPARA 229: Snap employees also circulated media reports that dealers were finding buyers through its Quick Add feature and that, \u201cper our analysis, on average at least ~700k Snapchatters are exposed to drug content daily in the areas we scanned.\u201d A presentation by the security firm Crisp advised Snap, in a slide headed \u201cEnabling Easy Access to Illegal Substances,\u201d that: \u201cIt takes under a minute to use Snapchat to be in position to purchase illegal and harmful substances.\u201d Still in 2022, another firm warned that Snap's features promoted the sale of drugs, warning that not only does Quick Add connect buyers and sellers of drugs, but that Snap's algorithm then \u201csuggests users with similar names and profile types\u201d and that \u201c[a]rtificial intelligence is trained to link these similar accounts together\u201d and that \u201cadding drug or porn accounts leads to more suggested drug and porn accounts.\u201d\nPARA 230: In June 2020, Snap received a list of concerns from the Daniel Spargo-Mabbs (DSM) Foundation, a drug and alcohol education charity, regarding the availability of drugs on Snapchat. DSM noted, \u201cIt is far too easy to find accounts openly selling illegal drugs on Snapchat.\u201d They further stated, \u201cSnapchat is over-reliant on users reporting drug-related content, despite recognizing low levels of reporting by users.\u201d In preparation for an August 2020 meeting with the founder of DSM to address concerns raised about drug dealing on Snapchat, an internal memo laid out Snap's approach to the meeting and draft responses. In part, Snap noted, \u201cWe apply different steps against illegal activity to different elements of the platform, some of which we do not publicize to prevent circumvention of those steps. The public side of Snapchat - our Discover platform - is curated and pre-moderated, which prevents opportunity for this kind of activity. When it comes to users' private communications - their Snaps, Chats and Stories - users do have a justifiable expectation that these aren't being monitored or scanned (just as is the case with iMessage, SMS, Whatsapp or private phone calls), and that's not something that we do.

One Snap executive noted, \u201cOur strike system isn't yet activated at this point, and the silver lining there is that our draft approach can be adjusted without creating any operational headaches. For consistency across our enforcement framework, my bias is for launching the strike system with three consistent tiers - zero tolerance; 3-strike violations; and 5-strike violations - so here, we'd be contemplating moving weapons into the zero-tolerance tier. I'm very sensitive to the risks of weapon sales on our platform and I'm open to stricter prohibition.

In August 2022, a Snap employee raised concerns about the need to take steps to ensure that user reports of grooming and sextortion were not \u201ccontinuing to fall through the cracks,\u201d making clear that Snap was aware of the ongoing problem and its failure to adequately address even the dangerous, violating conduct brought to its attention:\n\u201cI am surfacing this thread regarding the guidance previously provided to our vendor agents with the hopes of better understanding the existing guidance so that we can determine how we might need to expand it to ensure that user reports related to grooming and sextortion are not continuing to fall through the cracks. This afternoon [we] discovered that a quick search for the term \u201cnudes\u201d in OhSnap comments surfaces a number of tasks that entered the Account Reporting - Impersonation queue\u2026 in which the users\u2019 reports detail the user being sextorted or asked for nudes (which is often the start of sextortion), but no action is taken by the agents. While we\u2019ll need to be mindful of how our guidance to the vendor agents influences the flow of escalations to FTEs, I do think we should revisit this to make sure we are being adequately strategic and responsive to our users\u2019 reports.\u201d\nPARA 113: Others agreed and commented:\n\u201cI think want [sic] to add criteria for escalating suspicious accounts, but also don\u2019t want to overwhelm FTE Specialists\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you raised this, as it\u2019s something I wanted to talk to you about after reviewing a big chunk of the 350 names sent to us by NCMEC last week, most of which were sextortion accounts.\u201d\n\u201c...current guidance meant that vendors were not raising these for further review, so I\u2019m sure this is something we should address straight away.\u201d\nPARA 114: Snap failed to disclose this security failure to its young users and parents.\nNM P. 59-60, PARA 132-134\nPARA 132: Indeed Snap was well aware\u2013and failed to inform users, parents and the public\u2013that sextortion was a rampant, \u201cmassive\u201d and \u201cincredibly concerning issue\u201d on Snapchat. In a November 2022 internal email trying to confirm data queries, a T&S [Trust and Safety] team member stated, \u201cThey indicate that we are getting around 10,000 user reports of sextortion each month. If this is correct, we have an incredibly concerning issue on our hands, in my humble opinion. It seems to me that having an accurate understanding of the magnitude of this issue is extremely important given the psychological impact of sextoriton [sic] on victims, especially when those victims are minors.\u201d\nPARA 133: A T&S Investigations employee replied:\n\u201cI think our teams understand this is a huge problem. Curious if Exec is aware just how massive and impactful the scale of the issue is. Worth noting that 10k monthly reports likely represents a small fraction of this abuse as this is an embarrassing issue that is not easy to categorize in reporting.\u201d\nPARA 134: A December 2022 draft Snap Marketing Brief titled \u201cSexting and Sextortion,\u201d recognized that adults were targeting minors for \u201cdeeply pernicious and dangerous\u201d conduct on the platform but did not want to \u201cstrik[e] fear\u201d among its young users:\nIn the eyes of many, Snapchat is associated with \u201csexting\u201d - and believe it\u2019s what the app was designed for. It is undeniable that over the last 10 years, \u201csexting\u201d or sending of nudes has become common behavior across many age demographics. Sexting has become a \u201cregular behavior\u201d amongst Generation Z, and we know it happens on Snapchat. In many (though by no means all) cases, sending what seems like run-of-the-mill sexual content can lead to disproportionate consequences and severe harms.\nWe believe that one of the upstream issues for many (but not all) of these harms involves young people being friended by individuals that they don\u2019t know in real life and furthermore being able to recognize demands for sexual content, the performance of sexual acts and other suspicious activity that can lead to sexting/sextortion cases. Reporting violating content or concerning contact with/behavior by strangers is a key action that teens/Snapchatters can take when confronted with these situations.\nAs a platform that has significant reach and engagement with the Gen-Z community, we recognize our responsibility to ensure teens are educated and informed about the potential consequences of some of the behaviors that currently feel very normalized.\nWe are keen to avoid a finger-wagging tone and want the key messages to be shared in an informative and non-judgemental way. We can\u2019t tell our audience NOT to send nudes; this approach is likely futile, \u201ctone deaf\u201d and unrealistic. That said, we also can\u2019t say, \u2018If you DO do it: (1) don\u2019t have your face in the photo, (2) don\u2019t have tattoos, piercings or other defining physical characteristics in view, etc.\u2019 Bottom line: We cannot be seen as aiding and abetting the production of (at a minimum) child sexually exploitative material. We need to run through a very thoughtful messaging & visual storytelling exercise/session on how to best balance education without striking fear into Snapchatters. (emphasis added) [[The original quote bolds \u201cwithout striking fear into Snapchatters\u201d]]\nNM P. 70, PARA 167\nAdditionally Snap\u2019s internal documents also contain a \u201cSextortion handbook\u201d which shows how to use Snap Maps to target a school where they can, \u201ctap on the screen to view any snap stories that might have been shared by students who share snap stories with the \u2018snap maps\u2019 options enabled.\u201d [[This is referencing a \u201csextortion handbook\u201d that was developed by sexual predators for sextorting minors using Snapchat.]]\nNM P. 50-51, PARA 107.\nSnap continued to discuss\u2013internally\u2013evidence of ongoing child sexual exploitation on its platform. An internal email dated June 7, 2021, noted \u201cFlagging this piece looking at the % of child sexual assaults that were facilitated by technology. Between 2007-2013 FB was the highest, then dating apps until 2017, after which Snapchat is recorded as the most used platform.\u201d The attached article, \u201cJump in sexual assaults of children groomed online,\u201d called out the prevalence of child sexual abuse on Snapchat stating, \u201cThey found a big upswing since 2015 in perpetrators using social media platforms, especially Snapchat and dating sites, to communicate with children aged between 12 and 17 before meeting and assaulting them.\u201d The article continued, \u201cIn the early years of the study, between 2007 and 2013, three-quarters of offenders had used Facebook to communicate with child victims, but between 2014-2016 dating apps, many that children should be too young to access, started to feature. Between 2017 and 2020, Snapchat had been the platform employed by nearly half of offenders.\u201d [[You can find this article here.]]\nNM P. 62, PARA 142\nIn May 2021, Snap employees discussed this ongoing problem in an internal email titled \u201cResponsible growth initiative,\u201d stating, \u201cWe need to come up with new approaches that ringfence our most vulnerable users (minors) and make it hard for predatory users to find them via quick add, search, etc. We believe we can achieve this without meaningfully degrading the product experience for these users if we pursue new strategies in inventory generation/constraints and other techniques to more effectively silo minors from people outside their networks. This is probably the most important long-term thing we need to work on\u2026\u201d One employee continued, \u201cI wish we had more metrics to frame these clearly. What does success look like if we make progress here - obviously large-scale friending spam numbers goes down but what about low-grade \u201ccreep\u201d attacks. How does proactively playing D here help us unlock more growth?\u201d As this email indicates, the choice to address features that introduced minors to predators was harnessed to, and would only be pursued to service of, Snapchat's growth.\nNM P. 65-67, PARA 149-155\nPARA 149: Thus, a February 2022 PowerPoint prepared by Snap's consultant reported that \u201cmany young people reported being added by bots on Snapchat. This seemed to be particularly pervasive issue through 'Quick Add' feature as people described being added and receiving unsolicited messages from unknown senders.\u201d\nPARA 150: It was clear to Snap that allowing minors to be recommended to users with two friends in common failed to provide meaningful protection to children. A May 2023 internal email described results from a quality assurance test session to \u201cpressure test the friending, chat, and registration experience for minors.\u201d The findings included:\n\u201cMinors may receive a ton of random Quick Add suggestions: In tests where someone registered as a minor with their \u201cContact Book\u201d sync off, they received random Quick Add suggestions once they added 1 \u2013 2 friends. Alternatively, if you add multiple 18+ accounts, a lot of your Quick Add suggestions are adults... Minors can communicate with adults they are not friends with through group chats: There are a number of ways minors (or anyone) can be added to group chats without being friends with people who could abuse them. [[redacted text]] These are difficult features to solve for, but we may want to consider exploring additional safeguards for minors as they pertain to group messages and invite links (e.g. callouts that they are joining a group with people they may not know/aren't friends with; warning when clicking invite links; etc).\u201d\nPARA 151: Thus, Snap recognized that restricting Quick Add to friends of friends still exposed minors to introductions to adult strangers. If one or more minors in a network fall victim to an adult groomer, that pedophile can contact everyone in that network.\nPARA 152: Snap acknowledged internally that \u201cBad actors\u201d would groom 2-3 friends on other platforms, such as gaming platforms, in order to jumpstart the algorithm to suggest additional minor friends.\nPARA 153: Consistent with Snap's own findings, the 2023 Federal Human Trafficking Report noted that Snapchat was one of the \u201cTop Platforms used in the recruitment of Victims 2019-2023.\u201d\nPARA 154: On January 31, 2024, Snap published the written Congressional testimony of Evan Spiegel on its Safety Blog, quoting his statement that: \u201cSnapchat's default \u201cContact Me\u201d settings are set to friends and phone contacts only for all accounts, and can't be expanded.\u201d\n[Quote by Spiegel] \u201cWe want Snapchat to be safe for everyone, and we offer extra protections for minors to help prevent unwanted contact and provide an age-appropriate experience. Snapchat's default \u201cContact Me\u201d settings are set to friends and phone contacts only for all accounts, and can't be expanded. If a minor receives a friend request from someone they don't share a mutual friend with, we provide a warning before they start communicating to make sure it is someone they know. As a result, approximately 90% of friend requests received by minors on Snapchat are from someone with at least one mutual friend in common. Our goal is to make it as difficult as possible for people to be contacted by someone they don't already know.\u201d\nHowever, an internal survey conducted by Snap's Product Research team in August of 2022 indicated that Snap users of all age brackets can toggle their \u201cContact Me\u201d settings to \u201cEveryone.\u201d In addition, the survey showed that a large number of users who had \u201cEveryone\u201d enabled to contact them were under the impression that \u201cEveryone\u201d only applied to \u201cJust Friends that I Added\u201d (24.8%), a percentage that was highest for users in the youngest age brackets (13-17 and 18-24).\nPARA 155: Additionally, Snap's search term tool allows unknown adults to identify minor accounts. In January 2019, in an internal discussion regarding how to respond to a press inquiry in the United Kingdom, a Snap T&S employee admitted, \u201cI wasn't aware that you were able to use search terms to bring up accounts. Using 'underage' just now there are accounts like 'These Girls R Underage' or 'Underage Nudes' and 'Nude Underage Girls'. I thought that you needed to know an account name in order to be able to search for accounts.\u201d This design defect provides another means for adult predators to find and solicit minors on Snap's platform.\n3.3 In-Person Sexual Predation and Assault\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *. Real life example: The following facts are alleged from New Mexico v.

This user (who was a 27-year-old male) \u201coffered her money and she agreed to meet him in person, where, feeling pressure to do something, she performed oral sex on him. The girl continued to communicate with Marquez on Snapchat and arranged to meet him again on several occasions, where he again sexually assaulted her.\u201d\nReal life example: The following facts are alleged in the public complaint Nevada v. Snap P. 49, PARA 143: \u201cIn another instance, a 25-year-old used Snap Map to hunt down and sexually assault a 16-year-old in Florida. Per a local news report, the man: [U]sed Snapchat to reach out to the girl, then, unbeknownst to the teen, track[ed] her down in real-time using the Snapchat feature called Snap Map. \u2018Our victim posted a life story, and then he used Snap Map to track her down because of the meta tags that's [sic] in the photo,\u2019 [a law enforcement official] said. Detectives said the Snap Map allowed the suspect to see the data the teen posted and know just where she posted it from. [\u2018]If you don\u2019t hide your location where you make that [sic], take that photo or that posting from, they can use data that's hidden in the photo to track you down,\u2019 [the same official] said.\u201d\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.\nNew Mexico (NM)\nNM P. 68-69, PARA 158-164\nPARA 158: Snapchat was long aware of the potential safety issues regarding Snap Map from direct user reports. For example, in June 2017, Snap\u2019s T&S Team Leads discussed \u201cSnap Map Privacy Concerns.\u201d The first report:\n\u201c2. User wrote in stating the following:\n1. I was at a party and a group of older men found us all on snapmap and they tried to come in and threatened to hurt us. We put our bitmojis on ghost but\u2026\n2. My account was hacked and the hackers could of seen my location from the snapmap and this makes me extremely worried and concerned\nI don\u2019t feel this feature is safe and even if you people were told to put themselves on ghost mode, what would the relevance of the feature be then anyway. It\u2019s endangering people.\u201d\nPARA 159: Snap T&S employees internally voiced disbelief that there was a way \u201cfor a group of strange men to find them on Snap Map without being friends,\u201d but responded to the user encouraging her to report any crime to law enforcement. The T&S representative also informed the user about \u201cOnly Me (Ghost Mode)\u201d; the feature a user can affirmatively activate to prevent being \u201cvisible to anyone else on the Map.\u201d However, they acknowledged, \u201ceven with Ghost Mode enabled, if you choose to submit a Snap to Our Story, it may show up on the heat map for Snapchatters to view.\u201d\nPARA 160: On July 16, 2017, Snap employees circulated an article which included an interview with the Chief Executive of Parent Zone, who warned of the risks to children posed by Snap Map. She noted the connection between Snap Map and fear of missing out (FOMO) and social exclusion\u2014particularly powerful with adolescents\u2014but also noted, \u201cWe very rarely say this, but in this instance we are saying \u2018This feature is adding nothing to your life and it's a threat to your security, so turn it off.\u2019\u201d [[You can find this article here.]]\nPARA 161: In the same article, a television show panelist noted the danger of \u201cstrangers or online acquaintances [users] have never met in real life\u201d being able to see children's exact location. The article reported that police used a decoy account to \u201cpinpoint where videos of an 18-month-old toddler, a two-year-old girl and teenagers drinking alcohol at parties had been made.\u201d\nPARA 162: In a November 2020 internal document, Snap acknowledged that \u201cPreviously public content (e.g., posts to the Map) could generate 'Friend Requests' from illegitimate friends (people who the account holder did not know and may not have wanted to be connected with).\u201d Thus, Snap Map might not only disclose a user's current location but allow followers to stay in touch with that user.\nPARA 163: In September 2022, Snap employees proposed additional safety controls for Snap Map and acknowledged that it was making young users even more vulnerable to predators, including from friend requests from strangers: \u201cMy only suggestion is we consider you ACCEPT a friend request from someone who appears outside your normal friend graph (e.g., - no friends in common). A lot of the predatory/abusive friending that leads to real world harms will typically happen on an inbound basis rather than an outbound basis, i.e., usually the predator is trying to add a lot of kids, rather than the other way around.\u201d\nPARA 164: Snap employees agreed, stating, \u201cUnderaged users become even more vulnerable if the predators make friends with them and see their trail on the map.\u201d\nNM P. 70, PARA 165-167\nPARA 165: On June 25, 2024, Snap stated that \u201cSnapchatters can only ever share their whereabouts with their existing Snapchat friends \u2014 there is no option to broadcast their location to the wider Snapchat community.\u201d\nPARA 166: However, an internal custodial document titled, \u201cSnap Safety and Privacy Principles for Minors (13-15-year-olds),\u201d stated that \u201cgeofilters\u201d were considered a \u201cresidual risk\u201d in terms of \u201cexpos[ing] precise location of minors beyond their opted-in friends.\u201d\nNM P. 75, PARA 183\nDespite its public statement regarding its commitment to privacy, Snap knows that its privacy settings are frequently misleading, especially to young users. A survey by its [[Snap\u2019s]] Product Research team revealed that one-quarter of users thought that \u201cenabling \u2018Everyone\u2019 to contact them applies only to \u2018Just My Friends that I added\u2019....\u201d\nHarm 4: Cyberbullying\n[[According to the briefs, the company is aware of cyberbullying on their platform that is exacerbated by specific design features, including its anonymity and the app\u2019s ephemeral nature seen in disappearing photos and messages. Between 2019-2021, Snap enabled third-party Apps such as YOLO and LMK15 on their platform. These apps were often used by teens to post anonymous polls and Q&A\u2019s. Note that Snap did remove such apps from their platform after the Carson v. Snap litigation.]]\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.\nReal life example: The following facts are alleged in the public complaint Bride v. Snap Inc. P. 18-21, PARA 66-85, P. 2 PARA 6, P. 23 PARA 89, P. 52 PARA 209: Carson Bride was 16 when he took his own life by hanging himself at his home on the morning of June 23, 2020.\n\u201cOn or about July 4, 2020, it was revealed that Carson had been bullied on Defendants\u2019 apps Snapchat, YOLO and LMK prior to his suicide. After Carson ended his life, two psychologists who provided care to Carson and his family opined that Carson\u2019s suicide was triggered by cyberbullying.\u201d\n\u201cUpon information and belief, from January 23, 2020 to June 22, 2020, Carson received 105 messages via YOLO\u2026 of the 105 anonymous messages Carson received via YOLO, 62 messages included content that was meant to humiliate him, often involving sexually explicit and disturbing content.\u201d\nThrough Carson\u2019s internet search history, investigators concluded that Carson made multiple attempts to reveal the identities of the bullies. \u201cCarson relied on YOLO\u2019s misrepresentations that it would reveal the identities of aggressors\u201d on their platform. Snap also failed to deliver on its statements that \u201cit would remove any third party apps that allow bullying and harassing behavior on its platform.\u201d\n\u201cOn the first screen of the user\u2019s interface with the app, YOLO states, \u2018No bullying. If you send harassing messages to our users, your identity will be revealed.\u2019\u201d The lack of follow through on this statement is seen in Carson's internet search history of items such as \u201cYOLO Identity Reveal\u201d, and multiple in-app attempts to have abusers \u201c\u2018S/U\u2019 (Swipe Up) to reveal their identities\u201d, with no results. And as further evidenced in Carson\u2019s final attempt to find out who was sending abusive YOLO messages to him, on the morning of his suicide, Carson\u2019s final phone search was \u201cReveal YOLO Username Online.\u201d\n[[You can read an essay from Carson\u2019s mother, Kristin, about her story and her experience dealing with Snap Inc. here.]]\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.\nInternal Evidence\nNew Mexico (NM)\nNM P. 60-61, PARA 136\nSnap's own research demonstrated that ephemerality was directly connected to parental concerns about the safety of their children. In the July 2023 Snap Parent Perceptions Research, it noted, \u201cCore Snap features \u2013 specifically ephemerality, location sharing, and streaks \u2013 are directly connected to specific parental concerns like bullying, inappropriate contact with either peers or strangers, and mental health.\u201d In the study, parents' views on Snap's ephemeral messaging were highlighted:\n\u201cEphemeral messaging is what parents most strongly associate Snapchat with, and in turn, this feature creates the most concern for them\n\u201cEphemerality exacerbates parents\u2019 worries about their inability to properly supervise their teens\u2019 communication with friends, or even strangers.\n\u201cParents also believe this aspect of Snapchat encourages their teens to behave without regard for possible consequences, and enables cyberbullying, contact from strangers, or inappropriate behavior such as the sending or receiving of sexual or explicit messages, images, or videos.\n\u201cWhile somewhat more rare, a few parents raised concerns about ephemeral messaging making Snapchat an easier platform on which to conduct the purchase and sale of illegal drugs. Topical concerns about drugs and sextortion were quite rare and infrequent.\u201d\nNM P. 126-127, PARA 317\nGiven Snapchat's disappearing messages and popularity with minors, the platform serves as a hub for cyberbullying and harassment \u2014 with bullies having little to no fear of consequences. In a February 2022 \u201cIn-App Reporting Research\u201d deck by Snap's consultant, they found, \u201ccyberbullying, both anonymous and from known contacts, was a commonly cited problem... Disappearing messages can embolden bullies to harass people with less fear of consequence.\u201d\nHarm Cluster 5: Underage Use and Lack of Age Verification\n[[Snap has an age minimum of 13 for users but has an age verification system that relies on them honestly reporting their own birthday and is easily bypassed.]]\nInternal Evidence\nNew Mexico (NM)\nNM P. 3, PARA 5\nTeens and preteens can easily register for unrestricted accounts because Snap lacks any meaningful mechanism to verify their ages - a child-endangering design failure that Snap has known for years. Indeed, in 2022, a Snap executive emailed: \u201cI don\u2019t think we can say that we actually verify\u2026.\u201d And Snap\u2019s platform facilitates underage use even though Snap has the capability of both determining that users are minors and providing warnings or other protections against material that is not only harmful to minors but poses substantial dangers of solicitation, trafficking, and other harms.\nNM P. 18-19, PARA 61-62\nPARA 61: In a March 2022 internal email thread regarding Snap\u2019s response to U.S. & Global age verification legislation, Snap\u2019s Senior Director of Public Policy International responded, \u201cThere\u2019s only so many times we can say \u2018safety-by-design\u2019 or \u2018we\u2019re kind\u2019. Politicians and regulators are looking for tangible, substantive progress/initiatives. I\u2019m not saying we should do that because we\u2019re told to do so, but we should be aware that our current position, having used it for so long, is wearing very thin. Age assurance, in particular, remains a real weakness.\u201d\nNM P. 116, PARA 289\n\u201cCurrently this type of [suggestive] content equates to ~5% Spotlight Story views for 13-17-year-olds globally.\u201d\nNevada (NV)\nNV P. 67-68, PARA 202\n\u2026Defendants\u2019 executives have admitted that Snapchat\u2019s age verification \u201cis effectively useless in stopping underage users from signing up to the Snapchat app.\u201d Not surprisingly, underage use is widespread. As of 2021, 13% of children aged 8-12 use Snapchat.\nNV P. 68, PARA 203\nSnap routinely obtains actual knowledge that its Youngest Users are on Snap\u2019s platforms without parental consent. A UK report from March 2023 supports this proposition. Ahead of Britain\u2019s planned Online Safety Bill, TikTok and Snapchat were asked how many suspected users under the age of 13 they had removed from their platform in a year. TikTok reported that between April 2021 and 2022 it had blocked an average of around 180,000 suspected underage accounts in Britain alone every month (totaling around 2 million, in Britain, for a 12-month period). For this same period of time, \u201cSnapchat had disclosed that it had removed approximately 60 accounts per month, or just over 700 total.\u201d A source within Snapchat acknowledged that \u201cIt makes no sense that Snapchat is blocking a fraction of the number of children that TikTok is.\u201d\n4. Conclusion\nSnapchat has been running an advertising campaign with the theme \u201cLess social media. More Snapchat.\u201d The implication is that Snapchat is not social media, it\u2019s just a way for close friends to keep in contact with each other, similar to texting but with more photos.\nIf that was truly the way it was used by nearly all of its users, it would not be particularly harmful and there would be no need for this post. But as multiple legal briefs and hundreds of quotations have shown, design choices made long ago and more recently have turned the platform into something that shares a lot with Instagram and TikTok. In addition, Snapchat\u2019s unique combination of quick-add, disappearing messages, Snapmap, and no record of the content of conversations makes Snapchat particularly well suited for ill-intentioned adults who want to interact with or sell things to children.\nAs Sarah Wynn-Williams recently said about Meta, \u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be this way.\u201d The same is true for Snapchat. As we have suggested in this post, Snap could fix many of these problems quickly if they were to make the platform less addictive to children and less inviting for criminal activity. For example, they could:\nWork harder to identify underage users and remove them from the platform. At present, at least several million children in the U.S. alone who are under 13 have Snapchat accounts. Social media companies could age-gate in a variety of ways if they wanted to.\nRemove the Quick Add feature, which is one of the main ways that adult predators and drug dealers get access to children and teens.\nRemove the streaks feature, which leads many teens to send photos to each other compulsively, needlessly increasing their time on the app.\nRemove beauty filters for minors.\nRemove engagement-based algorithms, at the very least, for minors.\nStop deleting posts on Snap\u2019s own servers. The fact that Snap does not store the content of conversations (beyond a limited period) is helpful for drug dealers, sextortionists, and others with criminal intent, but it does not improve the user experience for most children to know that even if something goes terribly wrong, their conversations cannot be discovered by law enforcement officers.\nWe understand that it is very difficult to run a platform used by hundreds of millions of people in many countries. But if you operate a platform that is central to the lives of children, including millions of 10-12 year olds, then you have a moral responsibility to make design choices for their benefit, even if those changes reduce engagement and revenue. You can\u2019t just pull more sharks out of the water. You have to put up a shark barrier, no matter the cost.\nWe are grateful that Snapchat has been willing to engage with us, and we recognize that their Trust and Safety team is working hard in a difficult and ever-changing environment. We hope to continue our conversation with them, and we hope to write about the platform in the future with news of major improvements.\nBut in the meantime, we believe that the quotations we have presented\u2014from Snap\u2019s leaders, employees, and consultants\u2014provides strong evidence for parents and legislators to take action on our second of four norms16 for rolling back the phone-based childhood: No social media before 16.\nSocial Media Victims Law Center is currently litigating 394 lawsuits in the JCCP and 197 in the MDL against Snap Inc. This number is a low estimation based on the cases being handled by this law firm.\nNew Mexico v. Snap Brief P. 54, Para 117\nNew Mexico v. Snap Brief P. 54, Para 117\nNevada v. Snap Brief P. 67-68, Para 202\nQuick Add: a list of potential friends generated by Snap\u2019s Artificial Intelligence for users to add other users as their friends with a click of the \u201cAdd\u201d button. Once a new friend is added, they have the ability to directly send disappearing messages and Snaps. Quick Add can be turned off in settings. It would be much safer to set it to off by default and require users to turn it on if they want the feature. We believe it should not even be offered to minors.\nSnapstreaks occur when two users exchange at least one Snap in three consecutive 24-hour periods. When the streak is achieved, users earn a fire emoji next to their profile avatar, and incentives are in place to continue the streak perpetually.\nNew Mexico v. SNAP: A 2024 legal brief of a lawsuit filed by State of New Mexico Attorney General Raul Torrez against Snap Inc. in the First Judicial District Court in Santa Fe County, New Mexico.\nNevada v. SNAP: A 2024 legal brief of a formal complaint and demand for jury trial filed by the Plaintiff State of Nevada, by the Office of the Attorney General, Bureau of Consumer Protection against Snap Inc. in the District Court of Clark County Nevada.\nNeville v. SNAP: A 2023 brief covering the complaint and demand for jury trial class-action lawsuit initiated by the families of multiple fentanyl overdose victims as the plaintiffs in the Superior Court of Los Angeles, California against Snap Inc.\nOne such brief is Bride v. SNAP, a 2021 brief of the class action complaint filed by the parents of suicide victim Carson Bride, along with several other parents of teen suicide victims. This complaint demanded that Snap remove third party SnapKit apps, YOLO and LMK due to cyberbullying and accuses Snap of knowingly hosting apps that are linked to abusive behavior.\n[[Stories are public/friends-only photo/video posts that disappear within 24 hours.]]\n[[Snapchat Discover: Snap\u2019s curated feed-based feature, in which content is only produced by verified users.

Better if they screenshot and email ghostbusters to report.\u201d\nOf course predators are drawn to this app. No child should have access to a platform that welcomes predators and deletes evidence. If calling \u201cghostbusters\u201d is your best chance of reaching customer support, then clearly proper regulations are not in place.\nEvan Spiegal has built a small empire on a foundation of sewage. As the father of a teen mentioned in this article, who died four months ago from a Snapchat dealer, I will only feel a sense of relief when this empire finally caves in on itself. Because no child using Snapchat is safe.\nThank you for this tremendous work in compiling such a detailed expos\u00e9 of harms. Adding the personal stories of the children who lost their lives to this app is especially important, as talking in numbers and abstractions can make us numb to the terrible real life consequences.\nThanks to your work these companies can no longer feign ignorance of the terrible harms they help cause. Nor can we after reading this."

Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead?

      "text": "Remember when you would \u201cpoke\u201d your friends on Facebook to get their attention, annoy them or just start a poke war? Well, Facebook is trying to bring back that experience with some small updates to the poking feature.\nThe company announced on Tuesday that it recently improved the platform\u2019s suggestions on who to poke and also made made it easier to find the poking page through search. Plus, Facebook added the ability to poke a friend when you search for them on the social network.\nFacebook says these small changes have led to a 13x spike in poking in the past month. Despite many of them not being around for the initial surge of poking, young users are starting to embrace the feature, as Facebook notes that more than 50% of pokes are coming from 18- to 29-year-olds.\nPoking is one of Facebook\u2019s oldest features, dating from the platform\u2019s founding in 2004, but was tucked away in the navigation after it lost popularity. Facebook never defined what the idea behind poking was, and left it up to users\u2019 interpretation, with some choosing to use it as a way to flirt.\nNow, the company is resurfacing the feature around the social network\u2019s 20th birthday and framing it as an easy way to say \u201chi\u201d to a friend.\nYou might be thinking to yourself, I haven\u2019t poked someone in over a decade, why would I do it now? Instead, ask yourself, why not?"

      "text": "Facebook has 3 billion users, but younger users quitting platform\nMore than a third of the world\u2019s population is on Facebook but it still finds itself in a battle for relevancy, and its future.\nFacebook says it is not dead. The social media giant also wants you to know that it is not just for \u201cold people\u201d, as young people have been saying for years.\nNow, with the biggest thorn in its side \u2013 TikTok \u2013 facing heightened government scrutiny amid growing tensions between the United States and China, Facebook could, perhaps, position itself as a viable, domestic-bred alternative.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 4 itemsMeta sued for $2bn over Facebook posts \u2018rousing hate\u2019 in Ethiopia\nFacebook parent Meta to pay $725m in Cambridge Analytica scandal\nMeta to roll out paid subscription on Facebook, Instagram\nThere is just one problem: young adults like Devin Walsh have moved on.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even remember the last time I logged in. It must have been years ago,\u201d said Walsh, 24, who lives in Manhattan and works in public relations.\nInstead, she checks Instagram, which is also owned by Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta, about five or six times a day. Then there is TikTok, of course, where she spends about an hour each day scrolling, letting the algorithm find things \u201cI didn\u2019t even know I was interested in\u201d.\nWalsh cannot imagine a world in which Facebook, which she joined when she was in sixth grade, becomes a regular part of her life again.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the branding, right? When I think of Facebook, I think ugh, like cheugy, older people, like parents posting pictures of their kids, random status updates and also people fighting about political issues,\u201d Walsh said, using the Gen Z term for things that are definitely not cool.\nThe once-cool social media platform, born before the iPhone, is approaching two decades in existence. For those who came of age around the time Mark Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com from his Harvard dorm room in 2004, it has been inextricably baked into daily life \u2013 even if it has somewhat faded into the background over the years.\nFacebook faces a particularly odd challenge. Today, three billion people check it each month. That is more than a third of the world\u2019s population. And two billion log in every day. Yet it finds itself in a battle for relevancy, and its future, after two decades of existence.\nThe cultural touchstone\nFor younger generations \u2013 those who signed up in middle school, or those who are now in middle school, it is decidedly not the place to be. Without this trend-setting demographic, Facebook, still the main source of revenue for Meta, risks fading into the background \u2013 utilitarian but boring, like email.\nIt was not always like this. For nearly a decade, Facebook was the place to be, the cultural touchstone, the thing constantly referenced in daily conversations and late-night TV, its founding even the subject of a Hollywood movie. Rival MySpace, which launched only a year earlier, quickly became outdated as the cool kids flocked to Facebook. It did not help MySpace\u2019s fate that it was sold to stodgy old News Corp in 2005.\n\u201cIt was this weird combination \u2026 no one knew how technology worked, but in order to have a MySpace, we all needed to become mini coders. It was so stressful,\u201d said Moira Gaynor, 28. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s even why Facebook took off. Because compared to MySpace it was this beautiful, integrated, wonderful engagement area that we didn\u2019t have before and we really craved after struggling with MySpace for so long.\u201d\nPositioning himself as a visionary, Zuckerberg refused to sell Facebook and pushed his company through the mobile revolution. While some rivals emerged \u2013 remember Orkut? \u2013 they generally petered out as Facebook soared, seemingly unstoppable despite scandals over user privacy and a failure to address hate speech and misinformation adequately. It reached a billion daily users in 2015.\nDebra Aho Williamson, an analyst with Insider Intelligence who has followed Facebook since its early days, notes that the site\u2019s younger users have been dwindling but does not see Facebook going anywhere, at least not any time soon.\n\u201cThe fact that we are talking about Facebook being 20 years old, I think that is a testament of what Mark developed when he was in college. It\u2019s pretty incredible,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is still a very powerful platform around the world.\u201d\nAOL was once powerful too, but its user base has aged and now an aol.com email address is little more than a punchline in a joke about technologically illiterate people of a certain age.\nTom Alison, who serves as the head of Facebook (Zuckerberg\u2019s title is now Meta CEO), sounded optimistic when he outlined the platform\u2019s plans to lure in young adults in an interview with The Associated Press news agency.\n\u201cWe used to have a team at Facebook that was focused on younger cohorts, or maybe there was a project or two that was dedicated to coming up with new ideas,\u201d Alison said. \u201cAnd about two years ago we said no \u2014 our entire product line needs to change and evolve and adapt to the needs of the young adults.\u201d\nHe calls it the era of \u201csocial discovery\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much motivated by what we see the next generation wanting from social media. The simple way that I like to describe it is we want Facebook to be the place where you can connect with the people you know, the people you want to know and the people that you should know,\u201d Alison said.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is central to this plan. Just as TikTok uses its AI and algorithm to show people videos they did not know they wanted to see Facebook is hoping to harness its powerful technology to win back the hearts and eyeballs of young adults. Reels, the TikTok-like videos Facebook and Instagram users are bombarded with when they log into both apps, are also key. And, of course, private messaging.\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is more people wanting to share reels, discuss reels, and we\u2019re starting to integrate messaging features back into the app to again allow Facebook to be a place where not only do you discover great things that are relevant to you, but you share and you discuss those with people,\u201d Alison said.\nFacebook has consistently declined to disclose user demographics, which would shed some light on how it is faring among young adults. But outside researchers say their numbers are declining. The same is true for teenagers \u2013 although Facebook seems to have stepped back from actively recruiting teens amid concerns about social media\u2019s effects on their mental health.\n\u201cYoung people often shape the future of communication. I mean, that\u2019s basically how Facebook took off \u2013 young people gravitated toward it. And we see that happening with pretty much every social platform that has come on the scene since Facebook,\u201d said Williamson. This year, Insider estimates that about half of TikTok\u2019s users are between the ages of 12 and 24.\nWilliamson does not see this trend reversing, but notes that Insider\u2019s estimates only go as far as 2026. There is a decline, but it is slow. That year, the research firm expects about 28 percent of US Facebook users to be between 18 and 34 years old, compared with nearly 46 percent for TikTok and 42 percent for Instagram. The numbers are more stark for youths aged 12-17.\n\u201cI think the best thing they could do is get away from being a social platform. Like they\u2019ve lost that. But hey, if they want to become the new Yellow Pages, why not?\u201d said Gaynor, who lives in San Diego, California and works in government.\n\u201cI really like Marketplace. I recently just moved, so that was where I got most of my furniture.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "Facebook is reintroducing its old 'poke' feature to boost engagement, especially among younger users, by adding a dedicated button, a poke-tracking page, and notifications. The company claims a 13\u2011fold increase in pokes after earlier tweaks and aims to make pokes more gamified, similar to streaks on TikTok and Snapchat. Meta positions pokes as a way to catch friends\u2019 attention, flirt, or annoy, but the move reflects a broader effort to regain relevance with Gen\u2011Z users. The initiative highlights Meta\u2019s focus on revamping its social platform to compete with newer apps while maintaining its core user base. The campaign underscores the ongoing challenge of balancing engagement with user experience and platform safety.",
