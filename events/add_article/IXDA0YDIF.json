      "summary": "The article reports the 2026 Princeton Review Best Colleges rankings, noting Thomas Aquinas College as the most conservative and Reed College as the most liberal, and explains the survey‑based methodology behind the 50 category lists. It also recounts the dramatic story of Helen Green, who unexpectedly gave birth to a baby in a Toronto hotel while on vacation, highlighting the ensuing bureaucratic challenges and financial costs. Additionally, the piece includes excerpts from a Dear Abby column addressing family dynamics and pet‑related hospitality concerns, and a discussion of the rising popularity of the graysexual identity among Gen Z, detailing its definition, community support, and cultural context.",
