  "content": "President Trump declaring an emergency over crime in the District comes as the commander-in-chief disputes the accuracy of police statistics showing a 30-year low in violence in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nMr. Trump mentioned that a Metropolitan Police commander was suspended after being accused of fudging crime numbers during the president\u2019s briefing about fighting lawlessness in the District by taking over D.C. police and sending in National Guard troops.\n\nThe allegations against former Third District Commander Michael Pulliam, whose precinct includes the neighborhoods of Columbia Heights and Adams Morgan, was placed on leave in May after the D.C. Police Union claimed supervisors were manipulating crime data, according to WRC-TV.\n\n\u201cAs they say, [crime is] getting worse, not getting better, getting worse,\u201d Mr. Trump said Monday. \u201cThere was a story about a man who had just left. He quit because he was asked to do phony numbers on crime, and we\u2019re going to look into that.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump brought up the report to counter arguments from city leaders, who have repeatedly held up plummeting crime statistics in the past two years to refute the president\u2019s emergency declaration.\n\n\u201cIn the last two years where we have been laser focused on driving down crime, we have decreased violent crime by nearly 50% of what it was, yielding the lowest violent crime numbers our city has seen in 30 years,\u201d read a joint statement from the D.C. Council, which is almost entirely controlled by Democrats.\n\nSEE ALSO: Trump deploys National Guard to D.C., federal government to take over city police department\n\nMetropolitan Police data shows violent crime is down 26% so far in 2025, just a year after authorities oversaw a 35% drop in violent crime in 2024.\n\nThe killings, muggings and carjackings that terrorized the city in 2023 \u2014 when the District experienced a generational surge in crime not seen since the late 1990s \u2014 have declined dramatically since then.\n\nBut carjackings and nonviolent car thefts are far more common today than they were a decade ago in the District.\n\nThe Trump administration touched on that by releasing its own statistics to follow the press conference.\n\nThe rate of vehicle theft in the District is more than three times the national average, the White House said, and carjackings went up 547% between 2018 and 2023.\n\nThe White House also said the District had a homicide rate of 27.3 per 100,000 residents last year, which it said was the fourth-highest in the nation and outpaced other nations\u2019 capitals such as Islamabad, Pakistan and Havana, Cuba.\n\nSEE ALSO: Cuomo says Trump will deploy National Guard to New York City if Mamdani wins\n\nOutside of the crime numbers, Mr. Trump may be looking to address the violent spasms that flare up on the tony streets around Capitol Hill or the bustling nightlife venues along 14th Street in Northwest.\n\nIt was the mob assault of a former Department of Government Efficiency employee this month near a party strip in Logan Circle that spurred Mr. Trump to exert temporary authority over the District\u2019s public safety infrastructure.\n\n\u201cDays ago, a former member of the DOGE staff was savagely beaten by a band of roving thugs after defending a young woman from an attempted carjacking,\u201d the president said Monday. \u201cHe was left dripping in blood. He thought he was dead, with a broken nose and concussion. Can\u2019t believe that he\u2019s alive. He can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nThe president cited a litany of other high-profile incidents of violence that have taken place this summer.\n\nLast month, a Capitol Hill intern was killed in a wild shooting that erupted by the Mount Vernon Square Metro station. The victim, 21-year-old Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, was an innocent bystander when he was mortally wounded by gunfire.\n\nDays later, a three-year-old girl was shot in the head after a gunman opened fire on her family\u2019s car in Southeast during the July 4 weekend. Honesty Cheadle eventually died in a hospital.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has a more personal connection to the 2024 killing of Mike Gill, a former White House official on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nMr. Gill was shot dead on K Street Northwest amid an armed man\u2019s rampage.\n\nThe president called Mr. Gill a \u201cfantastic person\u201d who was \u201cmurdered last year in cold blood in a carjacking blocks away from the White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all knew him. Great person. Waiting for his wife as she was walking to the car,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the slain father of three.\n\nMr. Trump rifled off other headline-grabbing crimes from years past, including the gunpoint carjacking of Rep. Henry Cuellar outside his ritzy Navy Yard apartment and the knife attack against a staffer for Sen. Rand Paul that was carried out by a \u201cdemented lunatic.\u201d\n\nBeyond just violence, the president appeared intent on tamping down the disorder that stems from hordes of youths running through neighborhoods or ATV-driving motorists who crowd major roads.\n\nMr. Trump also said he plans to remove the homeless encampments in the District that he has often said are an eyesore in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cThe process begins right now,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe confront bad people, but it\u2019s going to be something that will be pretty amazing to you as you watch it. And I think most of you say it\u2019s a beautiful thing to do.\u201d",

  "summary": "President Trump has declared an emergency over crime in the District, citing high-profile incidents in local policing. This comes as the commander-in-chief disputes the accuracy of police statistics showing a 30-year low in violence in the nation's capital. He mentioned that a Metropolitan Police commander was suspended after being accused of fudging crime numbers. The allegations were made during a White House briefing about taking over D.C. police and sending in National Guard troops. Despite these measures, city leaders have consistently refuted the president's emergency declaration. The administration also released its own statistics, which showed that carjackings and nonviolent car thefts are now more common today than they were a decade ago.",
