      "summary": "The article lambasts the finale of \"And Just Like That…\" for its gratuitous toilet scene, arguing it tarnishes the legacy of \"Sex and the City\" and signals a decline in the show’s quality and relevance. Fans and critics alike criticize the series’ shift toward forced diversity and shallow plotlines, citing the clogged‑toilet moment as emblematic of its broader failings. The piece also briefly touches on unrelated controversies—Jussie Smollett’s hoax, Howard Stern’s potential retirement, and an AI interview with a Parkland victim—to illustrate a media landscape rife with sensationalism and ethical concerns. Overall, the article portrays the show’s ending as a disappointing and unsexy conclusion to a once‑iconic franchise.",
