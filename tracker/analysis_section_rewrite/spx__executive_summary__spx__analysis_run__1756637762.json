      "feedback": "Your draft is coherent and fully focused on Ether, but it fails the acceptance gate because it does not explicitly map the view to a canonical handle with a sign and magnitude. Add a sentence that ties the 10‑20 % price upside to a concrete driver: “A 50‑100 bp cut in UST 10 y yields (ust10y) is expected to lift Ether by 10‑20 % (OGK8WLL69)(B1KYJ1GPU).” Use the canonical handle name **ust10y** (no underscore) and cite the Fed‑meeting ID for the 50‑100 bp cut. Keep the rest of the paragraph unchanged, ensuring each claim remains tied to Ether and that all citations are present. This will satisfy the handle‑mapping requirement while preserving the concise, actionable style.",
