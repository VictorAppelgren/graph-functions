  "title": "Starbucks Just Announced a Big Change. It All Starts Immediately",
  "description": "I can only imagine the reaction.",
  "content": "When I wrote my first book, 15 years ago, I was living in a very small apartment in Washington, DC. It was a nice place \u2014 but boy, did I ever need a change of scenery from time to time. Fortunately, I lived within walking distance of several fantastic options:\n\u2022 A branch of the District of Columbia Public Library.\n\u2022 Last but not least, a decent-sized Starbucks at the corner of 18th Street and Columbia Road NW in Adams Morgan. If I had to bet, I wrote a plurality of the book on my laptop at Starbucks \u2014 sitting alongside quite a few other people who were doing very similar kinds of work. In fact, I remember another author who recognized that I was reading a printed copy of the first pass pages of my book. I hadn\u2019t realized it at the time, but people like me were doing exactly what Starbucks wanted us to do: coming in, buying a coffee or two, and using the cafe as what the company liked to call a \u201cthird place\u201d \u2014 meaning not home, not an office, but wherever else might become your go-to place for meeting people and getting work done. In fact, there have been entire academic articles on the impact of opening a Starbucks in a community \u2014 some of which come down to the whole \u201cthird place\u201d idea.\n\nYou might realize that Starbucks is now the world\u2019s third-largest restaurant chain, close behind China\u2019s Mixue and McDonald\u2019s, with about 41,000 locations in 80 countries around the world. And it turns out, according to Starbucks, that customers in one of those countries have been taking the \u201cthird place\u201d notion a bit too far. That would be South Korea, where Starbucks last week announced a big change: customers are no longer be allowed to bring and use desktop computers, printers, power strips, and even cubicle-style partitions in their restaurants.\n\nCustomers will also not be allowed to leave belongings taking up space at tables unattended for long periods of time. This has been a trend in Korea, where some customers are known as cagongjok, which is a slang term combining the Korean words for \u201ccafe,\u201d \u201cstudy,\u201d and \u201ctribe.\u201d They\u2019re also just known as \u201cseat hogs\u201d and \u201ccafe squatters,\u201d according to a report in The Korea Times:\n\nThe issue goes beyond brief work or study sessions, involving customers occupying tables for hours \u2014 sometimes more than five \u2014 using power strips to charge personal devices, leaving belongings behind while stepping out for meals, and disrupting other patrons. A photo shared on social media last month showing a Starbucks table outfitted with a partition, headset, keyboard, mouse, and tablet recently reignited the controversy. The writer who posted the photo online said, \u201cThe person never returned to the seat for three hours. It\u2019s a small cafe, and there are people waiting for seats, so it\u2019s really frustrating when someone reserves a spot without actually using it.\u201d Starbucks has posted signs at restaurants across the country notifying people of the new policy, which went into effect immediately. South Korea has been in the midst of what another Korean news organization, The Korea Herald, called a \u201cmassive cafe boom,\u201d with government statistics showing that the number of coffee shops basically doubled in the country from 2015 to last year: 51,500 to over 100,000. Driving the growth: customers using cafes for study and workspaces.\n\nBut, a Korean industry research group found that buying a single coffee covers about 1 hour and 30 minutes of seat time for a cafe, after which it\u2019s operating at a loss for that particular customer. Anyway, I don\u2019t feel like I can comment authoritatively on how another culture ought to view its quirks, but in the United States, anyway, I have the sense that a \u201cbring your laptop, not your desktop\u201d rule is the unspoken norm. It\u2019s fun to imagine the incredulous reaction other customers would have had at my local Starbucks if people tried to bring a full suite of office equipment or create the equivalent of a private cubicle.\n\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",

      "text": "A customer using a large computer monitor and laptop charges electronic devices with power strips at a Starbucks store in Seoul / Captured from Threads Fed up with \u201cseat hogs\u201d \u2014 customers who linger for hours on end \u2014 franchise coffee shops in Korea are rolling out new rules to reclaim seating space and boost turnover. Many have begun enforcing new rules aimed at managing customers who occupy seats for extended periods. Starbucks Korea announced a nationwide ban, effective Thursday, on the use of personal desktops, printers, power strips and partitions in its stores. Customers who violate the rule will be politely reminded of the restriction by store staff. The move follows a surge in customer complaints over conduct such as putting feet on tables, setting up partitions and using large personal computer equipment in the stores. This development comes as Korea\u2019s franchise coffee shop market reaches intense saturation, with data revealing fierce competition for survival among brands. By late 2022, the number of shops nationwide surpassed 100,000. While growth in sheer numbers is impressive, the market faces mounting challenges marked by price wars and an ongoing battle for customer loyalty. The term \u201ccafe squatters\u201d has sparked ongoing debate in Korea. The issue goes beyond brief work or study sessions, involving customers occupying tables for hours \u2014 sometimes more than five \u2014 using power strips to charge personal devices, leaving belongings behind while stepping out for meals and disrupting other patrons. While many people visit franchise coffee shops to study or work, disruptive conduct by some customers has frequently sparked controversy. A customer leaves personal belongings after setting up a partition on a table, reserving a seat for an extended period at a franchise coffee shop in Seoul. Captured from Threads A photo shared on social media last month showing a Starbucks table outfitted with a partition, headset, keyboard, mouse and tablet recently reignited the controversy. The writer who posted the photo online said, \u201cThe person never returned to the seat for three hours. It\u2019s a small cafe, and there are people waiting for seats, so it\u2019s really frustrating when someone reserves a spot without actually using it.\u201d This is the first time Starbucks has officially implemented restrictions on cafe squatters. The decision was made by the domestic headquarters, not as part of a global policy, and applies specifically to its stores in Korea. Before Starbucks, Ediya Coffee posted signs asking customers who stayed longer than three hours to place additional orders and limited tables to one laptop each. However, this was not a company-wide policy, but rather a rule implemented by a specific store that saw heavy use from cafe squatters. Some coffee shops have even temporarily covered their power sockets with caps to prevent customers from using them. In addition to restricting certain items, Starbucks has also announced that customers who leave their seats for extended periods should take their belongings with them. The company is also addressing instances where a single customer occupies a table meant for multiple people, to ensure fairness for other customers. As Starbucks Korea becomes the first major franchise coffee chain to tackle the issue of cafe squatters, all eyes are now on whether other chains will follow with similar rules. Meanwhile, it remains unclear whether legal penalties can be applied to such disruptive customers. Theoretically, occupying a seat for an excessively long period could be considered an act that significantly disrupts cafe operations, potentially qualifying as obstruction of business. However, there have been no clear legal cases where such penalties have been enforced."

      "text": "Starbucks Korea is telling customers to leave their home offices at home.\nThe company has banned the use of desktop computers, printers, power strips and large partitions inside its cafes.\nOn Thursday, Starbucks confirmed it has posted new notices in every branch across the country. The signs also ask customers to take their belongings when leaving for long periods and to make room at shared tables so others can sit.\nThe move targets a small but persistent group of clients known as \u201ccagongjok.\u201d The term blends the Korean words for cafe and study tribe. It refers to people who work or study for hours in coffee shops.\nMost use only laptops. But Starbucks says some have been setting up large monitors, printers and even cubicle-style dividers.\nPhotos of these elaborate setups have spread widely on Korean online forums. In some cases, printers were placed on nearby chairs, blocking others from using them. A few customers even brought in partitions to turn tables into private booths.\nA Starbucks Korea spokesperson said the decision was made to keep stores comfortable for all visitors. The company also cited the risk of theft or loss when belongings are left unattended.\nCafe count in Korea nearly doubles in less than a decade\nThe backdrop is South Korea\u2019s massive cafe boom. Statistics Korea reports that the number of coffee shops rose from about 51,500 in 2015 to over 100,000 in 2024. That is nearly double the combined total outlets of the country\u2019s four largest convenience store chains.\nThe popularity of cafes as study and workspaces has partly driven this growth. But long stays can be costly for owners.\nThe Korea Foodservice Industry Research Institute estimated in 2019 that a 4,100 won ($3) coffee covers only 1 hour and 42 minutes of seat time before it becomes unprofitable. In 2024 that figure dropped to 1 hour and 31 minutes.\nStarbucks is not banning laptops or ordinary study sessions. But the new rule draws a line against turning cafes into full-scale offices.\nmjh@heraldcorp.com"
