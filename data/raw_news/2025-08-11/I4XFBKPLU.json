  "content": "Reddit is blocking the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine from indexing most of its site, after discovering that AI companies were scraping its data from the digital time capsule.\n\nThe move comes as Reddit tightens its grip on user data. The company doesn\u2019t mind AI firms training their models on Reddit posts, but they have to pay first. Reddit previously said it wouldn\u2019t restrict \u201cgood faith actors\u201d like the Internet Archive, but now it believes some are helping AI firms dodge licensing fees. Reddit\u2019s sudden change of stance highlights how data licensing has become a major revenue source in the AI era.\n\nThe Internet Archive is a nonprofit organization dedicated to building a vast digital library of websites and other online content. So far, it has archived billions of web pages, along with millions of books, videos, and software programs. Its signature tool, the Wayback Machine, lets users save snapshots of webpages and revisit them later to see exactly how they looked on a specific date.\n\nReddit says it has evidence that some AI companies are exploiting the Wayback Machine to bypass its policies and scrape user content without permission.\n\n\u201cInternet Archive provides a service to the open web, but we\u2019ve been made aware of instances where AI companies violate platform policies, including ours, and scrape data from the Wayback Machine,\u201d a Reddit spokesperson told Gizmodo in an emailed statement. \u201cUntil they\u2019re able to defend their site and comply with platform policies (e.g., respecting user privacy, re: deleting removed content) we\u2019re limiting some of their access to Reddit data to protect redditors.\u201d\n\nReddit told The Verge that the Wayback Machine will no longer be able to crawl post detail pages, comments, or profiles. Instead, it will only be allowed to index Reddit\u2019s homepage. The restrictions begin \u201cramping up\u201d today, and Reddit says it gave the Internet Archive a heads-up beforehand.\n\nThe Internet Archive did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo.\n\nReddit has been tightening control over access to its data in recent years. While the company is open to licensing its data, it\u2019s cracking down on companies that haven\u2019t paid up. The company has already struck multimillion-dollar deals with Google and OpenAI. In the Google deal, Reddit partnered with Google for both search indexing and AI training data, then began blocking other search engines from surfacing recent Reddit posts in their search results.\n\nIn June, Reddit sued AI startup Anthropic, accusing it of unauthorized scraping.",

      "text": "It\u2019s well known that the AI industry rests on shaky legal ground. Companies like OpenAI have built their multi-billion-dollar businesses on the backs of vast tranches of training data, much of which is sourced from copyrighted content. The creators of that content know they\u2019re being ripped off and, more and more, it\u2019s leading to lawsuits. We got another reminder of this conundrum this week, when Reddit sued Anthropic over its use of Redditors\u2019 posts in its training data.\nReddit\u2019s lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday, accuses the Amazon-backed AI company of breaching its user agreement. \u201cAs far back as December 2021\u2026Anthropic was already\u2014without authorization and in direct violation of Reddit\u2019s User Agreement\u2014training Claude on Reddit users\u201d posts, the lawsuit claims.\nAnthropic, whose flagship product is the AI chatbot Claude, has tried to position itself as the \u201cgood guy\u201d of the AI industry\u2014a company that plays by the rules and advances AI frameworks that are considerate of safety and ethical considerations. But, despite its \u201cwhite knight\u201d PR, the company has repeatedly run into legal issues that throw its supposedly \u201cethical\u201d businesses practices into question. This week\u2019s litigation is yet another reminder of that.\nThe lawsuit accuses Anthropic of unjustly enriching itself while also breaching the platform\u2019s user agreement. The suit claims that the AI company\u2019s bots have visited its website over 100,000 times since 2024.\n\u201cThis case is about the two faces of Anthropic: the public face that attempts to ingratiate itself into the consumer\u2019s consciousness with claims of righteousness and respect for boundaries and the law, and the private face that ignores any rules that interfere with its attempts to further line its pockets,\u201d the litigation states. It adds that Anthropic \u201ccontinues to publicly admit that it trains its Al technologies on Reddit content.\u201d\nWhen reached for comment by Gizmodo, an Anthropic spokesperson provided the following statement: \u201cWe disagree with Reddit\u2019s claims and will defend ourselves vigorously.\u201d\nThe war over AI content usage has become one of the industry\u2019s most prominent dilemmas. Platforms and artists are aware that their content is being pilfered for the sake of AI fuel, and they\u2019re firing up the lawsuit machine to fight back. At this point, OpenAI has been sued by so many different people and institutions that it\u2019s hard to keep track of it all\u2014everyone from Sarah Silverman, Ta-Nahisi Coates, George R. R. Martin, and Jonathan Franzen, to the Center for Investigative Reporting, The Intercept, a variety of newspapers (including The Denver Post and the Chicago Tribune), and some YouTubers. The New York Times is currently suing the company on similar grounds.\nReddit has sought to insulate itself from getting ripped off by developing contracts with AI companies that clearly stipulate an exchange of content for money. Last February, Reddit struck a deal with Google that allowed the tech giant to use the content on its platform as AI fodder, so long as the company coughed up $60 million a year. Not long afterward, a similar deal was struck with OpenAI. Anthropic doesn\u2019t seem to have gotten the memo, but it surely will now. More and more, it seems like this is the new model for the AI industry: To quote one of my favorite TV shows, you\u2019re going to have to pay the troll toll if you don\u2019t want to get pounded by a lawsuit. It\u2019s obviously a situation that favors large companies. AI companies with the resources will be able to buy access to large amounts of data to fuel their AI habits. Smaller, lesser-resourced firms will be shit out of luck."

The Wayback Machine will no longer be able to crawl post detail pages, comments, or profiles; instead, it will only be able to index the Reddit.com homepage, which effectively means Internet Archive will only be able to archive insights into which news headlines and posts were most popular on a given day.\nReddit will block the Internet Archive\nThe company says that AI companies have scraped data from the Wayback Machine, so it\u2019s going to limit what the Wayback Machine can access.\n\u201dInternet Archive provides a service to the open web, but we\u2019ve been made aware of instances where AI companies violate platform policies, including ours, and scrape data from the Wayback Machine,\u201d spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt tells The Verge.\nThe Internet Archive\u2019s mission is to keep a digital archive of websites on the internet and \u201cother cultural artifacts,\u201d and the Wayback Machine is a tool you can use to look at pages as they appeared on certain dates, but Reddit believes not all of its content should be archived that way.\u201cUntil they\u2019re able to defend their site and comply with platform policies (e.g., respecting user privacy, re: deleting removed content) we\u2019re limiting some of their access to Reddit data to protect redditors,\u201d Rathschmidt says.\nThe limits will start \u201cramping up\u201d today, and Reddit says it reached out to the Internet Archive \u201cin advance\u201d to \u201cinform them of the limits before they go into effect,\u201d according to Rathschmidt. He says Reddit has also \u201craised concerns\u201d about the ability of people to scrape content from the Internet Archive in the past.\nReddit has a recent history of cutting off access to scraper tools as AI companies have begun to use (and abuse) them en masse, but it\u2019s willing to provide that data if companies pay. Last year, Reddit struck a deal with Google for both Google Search and AI training data early last year, and a few months later, it started blocking major search engines from crawling its data unless they pay. It also said its infamous API changes from 2023, which forced some third-party apps to shut down, leading to protests, were because those APIs were abused to train AI models.\nReddit also struck an AI deal with OpenAI, but it sued Anthropic in June, claiming Anthropic was still scraping from Reddit even after Anthropic said it wasn\u2019t scraping anymore.\n\u201cWe have a longstanding relationship with Reddit and continue to have ongoing discussions about this matter,\u201d Mark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine, says in a statement to The Verge.\nUpdate, August 11th: Added statement from the Wayback Machine.\nMost Popular\n- GitHub is no longer independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- Reddit will block the Internet Archive\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- Sex is getting scrubbed from the internet, but a billionaire can sell you AI nudes"

      "text": "Reddit reportedly signed a $60 million deal with Google to allow its online communities to be scraped for AI training data, according to Reuters Thursday. Google will sift through millions of posts on Reddit, and train a large language model on Reddit\u2019s threads. The content deal was originally reported by Bloomberg but did not identify the \u201clarge AI company\u201d receiving the data.\nReddit is reportedly weighing an IPO with a $5 billion valuation, despite only bringing in $800 million in revenue last year. Reddit is not profitable but has a rich valuation because its online communities offer a perfect training ground for AI models. However, licensing out your user base\u2019s thoughts and ideas is not always reciprocated well. The most popular subreddits went dark in protest last year after users took issue with the company charging for access to its application programming interface (API), first announced in April of 2023.\nReddit\u2019s reported deal with Google is exactly what the platform has been looking for. Big Tech is hungry for data, and that has turned legacy news organizations, community forums, and even the University of Michigan into mere content farms. These deals, though upsetting to users, offer Reddit a path to profitability.\n\u201cThe Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,\u201d said Reddit CEO Steve Huffman to The New York Times in April. \u201cBut we don\u2019t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.\u201d\nBut when Reddit started charging for API access, it didn\u2019t just charge big companies, it also started charging small, independent researchers. This shift made it more difficult for Reddit\u2019s moderators to manage their communities, and some argued it made for a worse experience forReddit\u2019s 800 million monthly active users.\n\u201cWe believe that the longevity and success of this platform rest on preserving the rich ecosystem that has developed around it,\u201d said Reddit moderators in a collective letter from last June. \u201cThe potential loss of these services due to the pricing change would significantly impact our ability to moderate efficiently, thus negatively affecting the experience for users in our communities.\u201d\nReddit did not immediately respond to Gizmodo\u2019s request for comment.\nApple was exploring $50 million AI deals with The New York Times, Cond\u00e9 Nast, and other news publishers in December. Shutterstock is also licensing its human-made content to OpenAI for training on its models. Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube have also become increasingly valuable in recent years, as they\u2019re now seen as content gold mines.\nThe platform also introduced ads in recent years and made it impossible for users to opt out of seeing advertiser content in 2023. As Reddit becomes a public company, there\u2019s a growing concern from users that management will hurt the thriving community forum it has built.\nThere\u2019s also a bigger concern about how AI companies are licensing data. Content platforms are signing million-dollar licensing agreements with AI companies, but the actual people who created this content aren\u2019t getting a thing. Meanwhile, AI threatens to replace content creators in the editorial, graphic design, and film industries."
