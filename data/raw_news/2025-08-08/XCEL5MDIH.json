  "content": "Gone are the days when security and compliance were concerns delegated solely to technical departments. Today's complex and interconnected world presents challenges, also landing on the shoulders of those in the highest levels of leadership. For C-suite executives, the stakes are incredibly high. One misstep, one overlooked vulnerability, and the damage does more than stain a company's name. It can shatter a career, dismantle a legacy, and tarnish a personal reputation beyond repair.\n\nDIDO Solutions, a technology consultancy specializing in managing distributed systems and secure testing infrastructures, is positioning itself to play a significant role in these high-risk environments. Its mission is to safeguard systems and protect both the brand and the individuals entrusted with leading it.\n\nOver the past years, the firm has observed the transformation of the software development landscape, from siloed applications to highly integrated, globally distributed systems. Indeed, this positive transformation has unlocked scalability and innovation. However, accompanying these positives is a critical vulnerability: the lack of collaborative, real-world testing environments capable of mimicking the intricate web of dependencies modern systems rely upon.\n\n\"Updating and pushing updates or deployments without sufficient cross-environment validation can lead to unintended catastrophic consequences,\" says Ian Stavros, co-founder and CEO of DIDO Solutions. \"I'm not talking just about monetary loss. These failures create ripple effects that can cascade through industries, ecosystems, and executive careers.\"\n\nThe economic cost of poor software quality is noteworthy. According to a 2022 estimate by the Consortium for Information & Software Quality (CISQ), software-related issues drained approximately $2.41 trillion from the United States economy. Behind these numbers are not just broken systems but broken trust.\n\nDIDO Solutions believes that when systems crash, especially those tied to infrastructures like finance, defense, healthcare, or the recent cyber attack on grocery store supply chains, the disruption is measurable in human consequences. \"There is an influx of documented data breaches and software-induced supply chain failures, proving just how fragile and delicate these systems are. They've also exposed just how accountable executives are held when failure strikes,\" co-founder R.W. Stavros states.\n\nDIDO Solutions urges decision-makers to shift their perspective. It's no longer sufficient to say, or Regulatory frameworks, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, have introduced new levels of personal responsibility, particularly for CEOs and other senior executives. Under these laws, individuals can be held directly liable for oversight failures, especially those stemming from preventable technology or compliance lapses. This means accountability is direct, personal, and legally binding.\n\nIt's not only about fines or resignations. The narrative follows the executive when a major failure occurs. It trails them across boardrooms, affects future opportunities, and lives on in search engine results long after press coverage fades.\n\n\"A company's brand reputation built over decades can crumble in a day,\" Ian stresses. \"And with that collapse, the credibility of those leading the brand is also pulled into the wreckage. It's time for the nature of leadership itself to evolve. Executives must now think as personal custodians of trust, security, and systemic resilience.\"\n\nDIDO provides value in this space. It has pioneered a distributed, collaborative testing platform that mirrors the very environments systems are deployed. Its solution, the DIDO Testing Environment (DIDO TE), allows organizations to simulate and rigorously test updates within multi-tier, interconnected ecosystems before any real-world deployment takes place. These simulations replicate the structure, dataflows, and operational parameters of complex, distributed systems.\n\nFor executives, this translates to reputational armor. When a product, update, or integration has passed through DIDO Solutions' environment, it's validated under the same conditions it will face in the real world. The margin for error shrinks dramatically. Most importantly, the ability to catch unintended consequences before they spiral into headlines becomes a tool for risk mitigation.\n\n\"This is how we change the narrative from reactive to proactive leadership,\" Ian remarks. \"We know executives can no longer afford to rely on just internal assurances or delegate risk to technical teams. That's why we give them a collaborative platform to assert control, demonstrate due diligence, and make decisions with a higher level of confidence and accountability.\"\n\nUltimately, modern leadership requires more than ambition. It requires foresight, infrastructure, and a commitment to being unbreakable even in the face of unpredictable complexity. DIDO Solutions delivers the systems and strategies, making that possible.",

      "text": "UNFI cyberattack shuts down network and leaves Whole Foods and others in limboUNFI cyberattack shuts down network and leaves Whole Foods and others in limbo\nThe security breach was improving on Tuesday, but the distributor\u2019s deliveries were impacted\nUnited Natural Foods Inc.\u2019s (UNFI) third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday turned into a crisis-management situation as executives provided an update on a security breach that occurred late last week. The cyberattack could impact the shelves of UNFI\u2019s biggest customer, Whole Foods, in the coming days.\nThe breach overshadowed what was a strong third quarter, with UNFI posting a net sales year-over-year increase of 7.5% to just over $8 billion. Natural net sales rose 12%, while conventional food net sales increased 2.7%.\nUNFI first became aware of the security breach on Thursday, CEO Sandy Douglas said during the call. The wholesaler activated its incident response plan, implemented containment measures, and started working to assess, mitigate, and remediate the incident. By Friday afternoon, UNFI had shut down its entire network.\nUNFI is working with a third-party cybersecurity firm to implement a workaround, continuing to service customers as it is able. The distributor is bringing systems back online to restore customer service as soon as possible, Douglas said.\n\u201cWe believe we are managing the incident capably with a very strong team of inside and outside professionals, including specialized experts,\u201d Douglas said during the call. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to keep our customers, suppliers, and associates regularly updated on our progress and next steps.\u201d\nThe breach has already impacted UNFI\u2019s business, limiting the company\u2019s ability to ship to customers.\nDouglas would not comment on how much the breach is affecting business in terms of percentage of orders shipped, but said the company said it was doing all it could to serve customers\u2014including obtaining help from other wholesalers.\n\u201cThe focus is making sure we serve our customers and help them do whatever they need to do the best they can in this environment. In parallel, our focus is to address the issues as quickly as possible, ensure the systems are safe, and bring them back online,\u201d said Douglas.\nDouglas said the company uses multiple external benchmarks to assess itself when it comes to cybersecurity and will continue to look at every aspect of defense and what may be necessary to bolster cybersecurity going forward.\nThe breach was not the only dose of bad news during the earnings call. UNFI also announced it was ending its northeastern distribution agreement with Key Food Stores, which Douglas described as an \u201cunprofitable relationship.\u201d The termination will also close UNFI\u2019s Allentown, Pa., distribution facility.\n\u201cIt was a clear choice to end the agreement with Key Food after careful consideration of all the options,\u201d Douglas said.\nUNFI reported during the call that Lean processes to make operations more efficient were now being used in 20 of its 52 distribution centers. Gross profit increased 6.1% year over year to $1.1 billion, and adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $157 million, compared to $130 million a year ago. UNFI turned in its highest adjusted EBITDA margin rate in two years.\n\u201cOur results reflect sales growth above the industry benchmark and adjusted EBITDA growth that was meaningfully higher than our sales growth,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cAs part of our strategic plan, we expect to continue driving consistent annual margin expansion.\u201d\nDouglas said UNFI is tracking ahead of the three-year fiscal 2027 financial objectives that was set last year.\nDuring the 2024 third-quarter earnings call, the wholesale distributor outlined four foundational initiatives to become a more efficient and effective company, and in turn help accelerate free cash flow and strengthen UNFI\u2019s balance sheet. The four initiatives are: intensify network optimization, focus and reduce annual capital spending, optimize cost structure, and increase working capital efficiency.\nIn addition to the Lean processes at the distribution centers, UNFI has made progress to increase working capital efficiency by reducing inventory days-on-hand, the average number of days it takes to sell current inventory, to pre-COVID levels while also continuing to improve controllable fill rates. UNFI set the goal of generating up to $100 million in free cash flow during fiscal year 2025 and that it would use the funds to pay off net debt, which now stands at under $1.93 billion. Douglas said during the earnings call that goal has been surpassed and the goal could be over 50% higher than the initial outlook.\nUNFI is holding firm on its 2025 projections in net sales, which fall in the $31.3 billion to $31.7 billion range.\n**Join us at Grocery NEXT, September 10-12 at the Westin Chicago Northwest in Itasca, Ill., where industry leaders will explore the future of grocery technology, AI, automation and evolving consumer trends.

Add this complexity to the complexity associated with any distributed system, and it can quickly seem daunting and overwhelming.\nDynamic Testing\nTesting is a process that generally involves the execution of the system or program under scripted, controlled situations. The scripts can be human instructions in documents or they can be captured in text files that a testing engine uses to drive the software.There are various requirement conformity checks that can be done to verify functional requirements:\nQuick Test Environment Bootup Time\nConfigurable Test Environment for distributed networks up and running in within minutes.

It refers to the conceptual, domain independent, data elements, the relationship between the inter-relationships between the data elements and the data that flows between different components with a generalized DIDO.\nDIDO Wiki\nThe term Distributed Immutable Data Objects (DIDO) refers to the underlying technologies supporting distributed data and computation across a distributed network of peers using consensus algorithms to maintain integrity and consistency across the network. DIDOs are not limited to cryptocurrencies, the original blockchain, or distributed ledger technologies. DIDOs are applicable to other non-cryptocurrency domains such as supply chain, registries for birth, deaths etc., and lists of identification and authentication (IA) acceptable certificates including those that have been revoked. The DIDO concepts are captured within a Reference Architecture (RA), intended to represent any architectures relying on distributed networks of peers that store data and allow parallel computation. The DIDO RA is not intended as a physical \u201cmust-have\u201d requirements list, but more as a conceptual catalog of what \u201ccan-be\u201d.\nLearn more about who is behind the DIDO team\nWe are excited to introduce ourselves!"
