      "feedback": "Overall, you rightly anchor the piece on the 90‑day tariff truce and NVIDIA/Blackwell dynamics, but to reach world‑class quality you need a tighter, testable 3–6 month scenario map, a sharper causal chain from policy to market impact, explicit timing windows with path‑dependence, and precise quantification drawn only from the listed sources. Edit guidance: 1) reframe as a three‑phase horizon with explicit windows (Phase 1: immediate extension and trade‑talk cadence over next 0–4 weeks; Phase 2: Xi–Trump Summit or signaling in weeks 4–8; Phase 3: policy re‑pricing via CPI/Fed/RSI and RBA moves in weeks 8–24) and attach concrete milestones; 2) tighten the causal chain: extension → export‑control concessions and minerals access → NVIDIA licensing/Blackwell‑chip access terms → supply‑chain and capex shifts → AI/productivity uplift → equity multiple re‑rating; state each link’s mechanism (security, legality, licensing revenue flows) and the likely magnitude range where possible (e.g., potential 15% revenue concession for NVIDIA cited in the sources, 25bp RBA cut implied by MHTXPY45K, CPI/Fed risk signals from MHTXPY45K); 3) construct a base case plus 1–2 clear alts with invalidation rules (e.g., ALT1: hard escalation if export controls tighten or no chip access; ALT2: a more permissive tech deal that expands chips/minerals access while preserving security); 4) quantify inputs and use numbers from sources: 90‑day truce, 15% chip‑revenue concession, 25bp RBA cut, CPI trajectory, and the US CPI/Fed path; 5) map market transmission channels crisply (semis/AI productivity, rare earths/minerals flows, supply‑chain reallocation, private credit/financing flows, FX and risk premia) and tie them to observable signals in MSCI/US futures, oil/iron‑ore dynamics, and Asia earnings momentum as noted in MHTXPY45K; 6) integrate the two Bloomberg source accounts into a single coherent stance and acknowledge any conflicting details (legal viability of export taxes; which chips are accessible) without duplicating claims; 7) add watch‑list signals (NVIDIA licensing news, export‑control announcements, Chinese mineral policy, CPI prints, Fed/RBA decisions) and a confidence rating that reflects political timing and macro surprises; 8) keep to the SECTION FOCUS format by ending with a concise base case, 1–2 alt paths, explicit risks, watch‑list signals, and a calibrated confidence; 9) polish prose to avoid long run‑ons and ensure every numerically grounded claim has a source tag; 10) ensure every assertion about policy or market reaction attributes a cited source (P3SY5CIWY, A8QHO9CST, MHTXPY45K) and avoid introducing non‑source data.",
