      "feedback": "This draft delivers a plausible base-case but falls short on depth, cross-topic integration, and actionable specificity. Key edits: 1) sharpen the causal chain from macro/policy to S&P 500 earnings via first-principles: policy easing lowers discount rates and enables AI/cloud capex, which should lift platform breadth, GMV, and monetization; tie directly to numbers (MSFT Azure growth +39%, Q4 rev +18%; Shopify rev +31%, GMV share >12%) to anchor the earnings visibility and margin potential. 2) strengthen cross-topic synthesis (macro, policy, flows/positioning, valuation/technicals) by stating how a mid-4% 10-year yield and a softer dollar translate into higher AI-capex risk appetite, more favorable FX for exports, and higher equity multiples, with explicit channels from platform breadth to GMV growth to margin and cash flow expansion. 3) expand scenario structure beyond a single Regime A: add Regime B and downside cases with explicit triggers (e.g., tariff truce expiry, inflation surprise, oil-price surprise, dollar strength) and invalidate conditions (e.g., stronger-than-expected inflation derailing 10Y yield path). 4) calibrate the watch-list with precise signals: confirm the September policy outcome (25–50 bp cut and its impact on the yield path), tariff-extension status (RHXDOHQQX), and oil-market price path (J99EM2TPZ), plus include Shopify’s Q2’25 GMV and revenue anchors and MSFT/Azure metrics as near-term catalysts. 5) citation hygiene: keep to the IDs present, ensure each claim has a matching source (GX057ADL7 for policy, J99EM2TPZ for oil, RHXDOHQQX for tariffs) and remove or reconcile unrelated items (e.g., US urban crime dynamics) unless you can tie them to risk sentiment or consumer demand signals. 6) tighten wording and avoid hedges; replace generic “watch for” with concrete thresholds (e.g., 10Y yield moving toward 4.0–4.2%, FX dollar index moves within a 2–3% band) and specify how those thresholds shift valuation multiples and earnings in the model. 7) ensure the write-up remains a single compact paragraph while preserving the explicit source IDs, and avoid duplicative references; if needed, introduce a brief, one-sentence “watch-list” at the end rather than repeating the same signals.",
