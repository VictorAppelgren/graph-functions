  "title": "Dallas Cowboys streaming guide 2025: TV, schedule for lineup loaded with national games",
  "description": "Unsurprisingly, Dallas is all over the NFL's prime-time schedule this year. Here's how to watch all 17 regular-season Cowboys games.",
  "content": "The pull of the Dallas Cowboys is still seismic, and seldom few teams capture public imagination on a yearly basis. This year\u2019s iteration will play about half of its total schedule in standalone games.\n\nThose audiences will have so many flashpoints to circle around. How\u2019s Dak Prescott going to look after hamstring surgery? What\u2019s Brian Schottenheimer going to do as a new head coach in the NFL\u2019s automatic heated seat? Will the Green Bay grass look greener for Micah Parsons?\n\nActually finding and accessing Cowboys games is more cumbersome than ever, though. In addition to the usual channel rotation of CBS, Fox, NBC, ABC/ESPN and NFL Network, this season\u2019s streaming rights also extend to Amazon Prime, Netflix, Peacock and YouTube. It can get exhausting (and annoying) to keep up with all these changes, so we\u2019ve compiled a league-wide overview of how the current broadcast carousel works. All of the info below is formatted specifically for the Cowboys\u2019 2025 schedule (pre-flexes, which start as early as Week 5 this year).\n\nMake sure you\u2019re also following the NFL on The Athletic. Jon Machota is an excellent beat reporter, from Oxnard to Arlington.\n\nAll times listed below are ET.\n\nThe first thing we\u2019ll need to watch all 17 regular-season Cowboys games is a television package. Here are the most popular options, contingent on local availability, with pricing as of September 2025:\n\u2022 Fubo (Save $30) is $0 for the first week, $54.99 for the first month with the applied discount, then $84.99 monthly.\n\u2022 Hulu\u2019s live TV add-on is free for the first three days, then $82.99/month.\n\u2022 YouTube TV is $49.99 for the first two months (offer good through Sept. 30), then $82.99/month.\n\u2022 DirecTV\u2019s \u201cChoice\u201d package starts at $59.99 for the first month, then bumps up to $89.99/month.\n\u2022 Verizon Fios\u2019 \u201cMore Fios\u201d plan is $95 for an initial 60 days, then goes to $119/month.\n\u2022 Sling\u2019s most expansive \u201cOrange & Blue\u201d option has a deal for half off its first month, which comes out to $29.99 for its base price ($60.99/month after). With the \u201cSports Extra\u201d add-on, the deal is $44.99 for the first month ($75.99/month after). The company is also selling day passes for temporary access, with the weekly one at $14.99 and weekends at $9.99. Sling doesn\u2019t carry CBS networks.\n\nAverage monthly cost: $85-100. Depending on the carrier, this will cover all NFL action except for out-of-market games, \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d on Prime and the Christmas slate on Netflix.\n\nOur dueling homes for the busiest part of the weekly schedule. A majority of Cowboys games will fall into the Sunday afternoon bulk, kicking off at either 1 or 4-4:30 p.m. Typically (though not always), the East Coast home teams play earlier, while hosts on Pacific time take that second spot. Dallas is weirdly in the middle of those two poles, but its starry status usually pushes it into the late window.\n\nFor the most part, CBS has the AFC home games and Fox has the NFC ones. That\u2019s not absolute, though (blame something called the \u201ccross flex\u201d). In general, these over-the-air channels show games pertinent to the region. When there\u2019s no local team to prioritize, they\u2019ll show a game of national intrigue. Fox specifically brands this second afternoon window as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Game of the Week.\u201d Unsurprisingly, the Cowboys have held a timeshare there for the past several decades.\n\nBoth networks have broadcast teams to spread around the league on Sundays. Here\u2019s a refresher on those lead crews:\n\nJim Nantz and Tony Romo / Tracy Wolfson sideline\n\n Ian Eagle and JJ Watt / Evan Washburn\n\n Kevin Harlan and Trent Green / Melanie Collins\n\n Andrew Catalon, Charles Davis and Jason McCourty / AJ Ross\n\n Spero Dedes and Adam Archuleta / Aditi Kinkhabwala\n\u2022 Thursday, Nov. 27 (Week 13): vs. Kansas City Chiefs, 4:30 p.m. (the annual Thanksgiving game, and a good one at that)\n\nKevin Burkhardt and Tom Brady / Erin Andrews and Tom Rinaldi sideline\n\n Joe Davis and Greg Olsen / Pam Oliver\n\n Adam Amin and Mark Sanchez / Kristina Pink\n\n Kenny Albert and Jonathan Vilma / Megan Olivi\n\n Kevin Kugler and Daryl Johnston (\u201cMoose\u201c) / Allison Williams\n\n Chris Myers and Mark Schlereth / Jen Hale\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need to watch: One of the aforementioned cable or streaming packages, or a broadcast antenna for free over-the-air access. Local CBS games can also be streamed on Paramount+ (starting at $7.99/month). Local Fox games can also be streamed on Fox One (starting at $19.99/month).\n\nFew American sports teams have as many out-of-market fans as the Cowboys do. Those folks will need NFL Sunday Ticket to unlock the Sunday games. For an extra fee, they can also get NFL RedZone, the frenetic live whip-around anchored by Scott Hanson. That man is peerless in his love for American football.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need to watch: YouTube is the current digital home provider of NFL Sunday Ticket (DirecTV carries it for businesses). New Sunday Ticket users can subscribe for $276/year, which comes out to $23/month. Returning users with YouTube TV are charged $378, or $31.50/month, and those without YouTube TV pay $480 ($40/month). These are the prices without RedZone.\n\nAdditionally, the league\u2019s NFL+ Premium app has standalone RedZone access for 12 installments of $14.99. Full out-of-market games can\u2019t be streamed live here, though, making it a better option for fantasy players rather than dedicated team loyalists.\n\nThe Athletic\u2019s Andrew Marchand reported that ESPN recently sold 10 percent of its equity to the NFL in exchange for league media assets (NFL Network, cable RedZone rights and fantasy football games). So, as of Sept. 3, the new ESPN Unlimited direct-to-consumer (DTC) service is offering a bundle with NFL+ Premium for $39.99/month.\n\nSundays always end with \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d featuring Mike Tirico and Cris Collinsworth in the booth. Tirico is the successor to longtime SNF voice Al Michaels. Collinsworth, well \u2026 \u201chere\u2019s a guy\u201d who gets really excited about nickel corners and pass-blocking running backs. Melissa Stark is NBC\u2019s Sunday night sideline reporter.\n\nAs we get into the later weeks, NBC will flex into matchups with greater playoff implications. The same goes for ABC/ESPN (Mondays) and Prime Video (Thursdays). Network flexing is a contentious issue, though. Putting a more compelling game on national TV rewards viewers at home, but sudden schedule changes obviously hurt traveling fans. For SNF in Weeks 5-13, a flex must be announced at least 12 days before the game. That window halves to a six-day warning in Weeks 14-17.\n\u2022 Thursday, Sept. 4 (Week 1 season opener): @ Philadelphia Eagles, 8:20 p.m. (a Thursday night game with SNF production, just a heads up)\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need to watch: A TV package, or a broadcast antenna for free over-the-air access, or a Peacock account (sports subscription with ads starts at $10.99 per month).\n\nHere\u2019s where you\u2019ll find end-of-week pageantry with Joe Buck and Troy Aikman. Yup, the very same Troy Aikman who brought a title to Dallas \u2026 then another \u2026 and then a third to immortalize \u201cThe Triplets.\u201d\n\nIndustry vet Lisa Salters dispatches from the sideline, along with Laura Rutledge. When there are multiple Monday night listings, Chris Fowler does play-by-play on the doubleheader\u2019s other game, with former safety Louis Riddick and former quarterback Dan Orlovsky on color commentary. Katie George and Peter Schrager cover the sidelines with that group. The MNF crew for ESPN Deportes includes play-by-play woman Rebeca Landa and analyst Sebastian Martinez-Christensen, with sideline reports from MJ Acosta-Ruiz and the incomparable John Sutcliffe.\n\nThere will usually be a simulcast on ESPN2 anchored by Peyton and Eli Manning. Sometimes, their presence is insightful; it can also devolve into frivolity and controlled ridiculousness.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need to watch: A TV package, or a broadcast antenna for free over-the-air access to ABC. ABC and ESPN are also available with the new ESPN DTC service ($29.99 per month).\n\nThis marks year No. 4 of TNF on Amazon. Al Michaels does play-by-play, and he\u2019s joined by Kirk Herbstreit (\u201cCollege GameDay\u201d staple and Golden Retriever enthusiast). Kaylee Hartung handles the sideline reporting. Thursday games are on the Prime Video app for national audiences, and broadcasts are free over the air in the two teams\u2019 home markets. Alternatively, TNF can be streamed on Twitch or with an NFL+ subscription (mobile only, however).\n\nLast year\u2019s ill-fated first TNF flex did not lead to new safeguards; rather, the league reduced the notice window from 28 days down to 21. Again, those flexes favor folks at home who want exciting and relevant late-season viewing, but it brings chaos to ticket holders and the participating teams themselves.\n\u2022 Thursday, Dec. 4 (Week 14): @ Detroit Lions, 8:15 p.m. (with an over-the-air TV broadcast in the Dallas market)\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need to watch: Amazon Prime, which costs $14.99 per month, NFL+ ($6.99/month) or a registered Twitch account.\n\nDallas\u2019 home Thanksgiving marquee has been a league constant \u2014 every year since 1966, except during the 1975 and 1977 seasons. Dolly Parton stole the day with her 2023 halftime show, and in general, this is NFL largeness at its largest.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need to watch:A TV package with CBS, over-the-air access or a Paramount+ subscription.\n\nWe were all but out of dodge \u2026 until one last streaming service stood before us. The NFL has now built out a Christmas slate, because the appetite for more football is never-ending. Dallas\u2019 Christmas game is a Netflix exclusive, too. \u2018Tis the season:\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need to watch: A Netflix subscription ($7.99/month with ads). The game will also be free over the air in the Dallas market.\n\nThere are no international games for the Cowboys, at least, but eight spotlight games (before flex scheduling) is more than enough to juggle. The only thing left to settle is the Week 18 finale at the New York Giants. The entirety of that Week 18 schedule won\u2019t be announced until the conclusion of Week 17. If there are heightened playoff implications for either team, the game could get shifted to national TV Saturday or the regular-season wrap-up on \u201cSunday Night Football.\u201d\n\nStreaming links in this article are provided by partners of The Athletic.

      "text": "By Saad Yousuf, Jon Machota, Matt Schneidman and Dianna Russini\nThe Athletic has live coverage of the Micah Parsons trade.\nThe Dallas Cowboys have traded star edge rusher Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, the Cowboys announced on Thursday.\nIn exchange, Dallas will receive Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark and first-round draft picks in 2026 and 2027 from Green Bay.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to Parsons\u2019 agency, he has also signed a four-year extension with Green Bay for $188 million with $136 million guaranteed and an average annual salary of $47 million, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history.\nParsons, 26, is entering his fifth season in the NFL after being drafted by Dallas with the No. 12 pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. The Cowboys host the Packers on Sunday Night Football on Sept. 28 at AT&T Stadium.\nWe have completed a trade to receive a 2026 first-round pick, a 2027 first-round pick, and Pro Bowler DT Kenny Clark from the Packers in exchange for Micah Parsons.\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f: https://t.co/7Hiwb2Nilj | @blockchain pic.twitter.com/NED5bHcHYT\n\u2014 Dallas Cowboys (@dallascowboys) August 28, 2025\nWhy Packers made the bold move\nOn the eve of the 2018 NFL regular season, the Packers lost out to the Bears for Khalil Mack, whom Chicago acquired from the Raiders for a king\u2019s ransom. In his first year as general manager, Brian Gutekunst showed a willingness to take a big swing for an edge rusher in the prime of his career. Seven years later, with his job potentially on the line under new team president Ed Policy, Gutekunst pulled out his driver once again for a similar move.\nThere are two players in league history with at least 12 sacks in their first four seasons: Micah Parsons and Reggie White. White is one of six players with his number retired on the Lambeau Field facade. Parsons will now call home the same stadium that one of the best players ever did.\nWhile the Packers gave up a three-time Pro Bowler and their longest-tenured player in defensive tackle Kenny Clark, they retained their No. 1 edge rusher (now No. 2) in Rashan Gary.\nGutekunst himself said Green Bay\u2019s pass rush was too inconsistent last season. It\u2019s part of the reason head coach Matt LaFleur fired defensive line coach Jason Rebrovich and replaced him with former Patriots defensive coordinator DeMarcus Covington. LaFleur also said that before defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley\u2019s first season calling the defense last year, he envisioned the Packers generating pressure on the quarterback by rushing a traditional four (like the Eagles effectively do). Instead, the Packers weren\u2019t able to and Hafley resorted to crafting exotic pressures with linebacker Edgerrin Cooper, safety Xavier McKinney and others to cause havoc.\nAdvertisement\nNow, the Packers should have an easier time generating pressure with four and dropping the typical seven into coverage (like LaFleur wanted last year) with Parsons and Gary coming off the edge, even if losing a healthy Clark up the middle is a big blow. That means more responsibility now falls on fourth-year defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt, a 2022 first-rounder whose fifth-year option the Packers exercised in May, and 2023 Day 3 picks Karl Brooks and Colby Wooden. Two rookie defensive tackles from Georgia, sixth-rounder Warren Brinson and undrafted signing Nazir Stackhouse, also made the Packers\u2019 53-man roster. \u2014 Matt Schneidman\nA stunning decision by Cowboys, Jerry Jones\nThis is a stunning trade by the Cowboys because Jerry Jones just doesn\u2019t make these types of moves. Jones falls in love with star players and doesn\u2019t let them leave the building in their prime. The other part is that Jones has become so conservative over the last decade that everyone just assumed he\u2019d do what he\u2019s done with every other star player \u2014 eventually give them a new massive contract. But maybe his recent Netflix documentary \u201cThe Gambler\u201d got him feeling nostalgic and looking to make a big splash. This would qualify.\nJones has always wanted credit for the Herschel Walker trade. That one set up the Cowboys\u2019 dynasty run of the 1990s. Maybe that\u2019s his hope here. Two first-round picks and Clark are far from what Jones got for Walker, but it\u2019s still very bold.\nThis deal is also surprising because no team has been a bigger thorn in Jones\u2019 side over the last 15 years than the Packers. They ended the Cowboys\u2019 seasons in 2014, 2016 and 2023. Dallas\u2019 best shots at making a deep postseason run. Definitely not the team anyone thought Jones would send his team\u2019s best player. \u2014 Jon Machota\n(Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)"

      "text": "It\u2019s another tough season for football fans who despise the Dallas Cowboys.\nDespite coming off of a 7-10 season in 2024, the NFL\u2019s ratings cash cow will be plastered on TV screens across the country throughout the 2025 season. The Cowboys will play on Thursday a whopping four times, including the NFL\u2019s season opener. They\u2019ll be on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d twice and play the Sunday night premier game twice (the season opener is on a Thursday night but qualifies as a Sunday Night Football broadcast). Dallas will have just four games in the early Sunday afternoon slot.\nAdvertisement\nFour Thursday games can sound like a terrible disadvantage for the team but it\u2019s not too bad for the Cowboys. The first Thursday game is the season opener, so it\u2019s not on a super short week. Another Thursday game is after the Thanksgiving game at AT&T Stadium, so it\u2019s a full week before a mini-bye. One of the Monday night games is right before the bye week, which is exactly midway through the season in Week 10, so that won\u2019t result in a short week, either.\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the main takeaways from the Cowboys\u2019 schedule.\nWeek 1 keys to victory\nWhile entering the season healthy can be considered to be a key for every team in Week 1, there are layers to the Cowboys\u2019 health questions. Last year, DaRon Bland was injured at the very end of training camp and didn\u2019t return to the lineup until late November. The Cowboys can\u2019t afford that type of situation to be an integral piece this year, especially with Trevon Diggs and DeMarvion Overshown virtual locks to not be ready for the start of the season. Speaking of Diggs, the Cowboys will be counting on third-round pick Shavon Revel Jr. to help fill the void at cornerback. Revel will start training camp finishing up rehab from his torn ACL but is expected to join the team during camp and be ready for the season opener.\nMust-watch game: Week 13 vs. Chiefs\nThis will be Kansas City\u2019s first trip to Dallas since 2017 when Patrick Mahomes was a rookie backup to Alex Smith. Mahomes, who is from Whitehouse, Texas, in East Texas, isn\u2019t a Dallas native but reps the Metroplex often, such as his known fandom for the Dallas Mavericks. Mahomes\u2019 first career game in Dallas will be a storyline, as will the Travis Kelce-Taylor Swift duo. More than that, this will be a great test for the Cowboys to see how they measure up against a perennial contender as they enter the home stretch of the regular season.\nAdvertisement\nToughest stretch: Weeks 12-17\nThe second half of the season, following the bye week, is an absolute gauntlet. The Cowboys will face the defending Super Bowl champions in Week 11 at home, followed by the AFC champions on a short week on Thanksgiving. Then, the Cowboys have a road matchup against the Detroit Lions, who tied with the Chiefs for the best record in the NFL last season. Immediately after that, it\u2019s a home game against the Minnesota Vikings, who are dealing with a quarterback change but went 14-3 last season. That\u2019s followed by a visit from the Los Angeles Chargers, who went 11-6. The brutal stretch concludes with a visit to Jayden Daniels and the Commanders on Christmas during a short week.\nOne game the Cowboys can\u2019t afford to lose: vs. Giants, Week 2\nThere are several options here. It could be either of the Giants games, or the Carolina Panthers or Las Vegas Raiders or New York Jets. Those are the five most winnable games on the schedule and four are on the road. But if Dallas drops its home opener, there\u2019s a good chance the home record is very bad this season. There are too many much more difficult opponents remaining. Lose that game early and it could be the beginning of a very ugly season.\nBest offense the Cowboys will face: Detroit Lions (Week 14)\nBen Johnson, Detroit\u2019s offensive coordinator from the previous three seasons, is now the Chicago Bears head coach. That will obviously impact what was arguably the NFL\u2019s best offense from a year ago, averaging 33 points per game. But the Lions\u2019 offensive personnel is still as good as any in the NFL. Led by Jared Goff and what should remain a top offensive line, Detroit has threats at every level in Jahmyr Gibbs, David Montgomery, Sam LaPorta, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams.\nBest defense the Cowboys will face: Philadelphia Eagles (Weeks 1 and 12)\nThere\u2019s no reason to think the NFL\u2019s best defense from a year ago won\u2019t again be near the top. Everything starts in the middle of the defensive line with Jalen Carter, but there are some other really nice pieces around him in Jordan Davis, Zack Baun, Nolan Smith, Nakobe Dean, Jihaad Campbell, Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean. And the whole thing is again being called by defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who might have been the MVP of the Super Bowl. No team came close to Philadelphia last season, holding opponents to less than 280 yards per game.\nPredicted record: 9-8\nMost oddsmakers have the over/under for the Cowboys this season set around 7.5 wins. While the addition of George Pickens should improve Dallas, there\u2019s no denying the difficulty of this schedule. Of the Cowboys\u2019 eight home opponents, seven have better odds to win the Super Bowl. Somehow the road schedule appears much more manageable. A first time head coach and new coaching staff will probably experience some bumps in the road even if they are fortunate in the health department. Eight or nine wins seems like a decent bet. \u2014 Machota\nAdvertisement\nPredicted record: 10-7\nThe Cowboys have a tough schedule but they\u2019ve also improved. It will be essential for them to take care of the games they are expected to win, split the ones where it\u2019s close, particularly in the division and then pull off an upset or two. If they stay healthy, specifically at quarterback, it\u2019ll be manageable. Getting Diggs and Overshown back in the fold as the tough stretch comes around should be a boost, too. If healthy, seven wins feels like the floor and 11 wins feels like the ceiling. \u2014 Yousuf\nPredicted NFC East finish: Second\n1. Eagles\n2. Cowboys\n3. Commanders\n4. Giants\nFrom top to bottom, the Eagles still have the best team. Yes, no NFC East team has repeated as division champion since 2004 but Philadelphia would have to sustain several key injuries for that record run to continue. Most will have Washington second, but everything went right for the Commanders last season. Could they build on that and be even better? Sure. But there\u2019s also a good possibility that they come back down to Earth now that they have much higher expectations. No one will be sleeping on them after their best season of the last 33 years. The Giants finishing anywhere other than fourth would be a surprise. \u2014 Machota\nPredicted NFC East finish: Third\n1. Commanders\n2. Eagles\n3. Cowboys\n4. Giants\nThe Eagles won the division last year, so if the trend that started in 2005 continues of no repeat NFC East winner, somebody else will take the division crown. That won\u2019t be the Giants, who seem destined for fourth yet again. I\u2019m interested to see how Jayden Daniels responds to the rest of the league being familiar with his game. It\u2019ll be a test for all of Dan Quinn\u2019s bunch but especially for the young quarterback. By no means do I feel confident it will be a slam-dunk positive result, but I\u2019m more optimistic than not. The Cowboys have improved but the Eagles haven\u2019t regressed much, so Philadelphia gets the slight edge and Dallas finishes close behind in the division.\n(Photo: Sam Hodde / Getty Images)"

      "text": "By Mike Jones, Nick Kosmider and Daniel Popper\nNFL owners on Monday passed a resolution that will allow the league to flex Sunday games to Thursday nights with a 21-day notice, the league announced during a Monday afternoon news conference.\nThe move offers the league another tool to make Thursday night matchups on Amazon Prime more compelling and allows officials to make such a move during a shorter window of time. Previously, flexing a game had to be done 28 days in advance.\nAdvertisement\nReducing the window from 28 to 21 days gives the NFL a chance to see an extra week of contests before deciding whether to flex games, officials said.\nLast season, the NFL flexed the Week 16 game between the Denver Broncos and L.A. Chargers to Thursday night, making that game with playoff implications a nationally televised contest and treating spectators to a more compelling matchup.\nThe Denver-L.A. game would have originally reached only 10-15% of the country, but the flex to Thursday night allowed the league to reach a larger-than-expected national audience, NFL officials said Monday.\nThe league also announced the renewal of its deal with HBO for \u201cHard Knocks.\u201d The move includes both the August preseason series and the in-season series introduced in 2021. The NFL hasn\u2019t yet settled on participants for the August \u201cHard Knocks\u201d series, but it\u2019s expected that the team will be settled on later this spring.\nThe league is engaging in separate conversations regarding the offseason edition of \u201cHard Knocks,\u201d which began with the Giants in 2024. No determination has been made on those participants yet, according to league officials.\nTNF flex has some strategic benefits \u2026\nThe flex last season made the Broncos a Thursday night road team for the second time. Denver agreed to the scheduling charge, in part because it created extra rest ahead of their game the following week against the Cincinnati Bengals. \u2014 Nick Kosmider, Broncos beat writer\n\u2026 but it can be complicated for fans\nAfter the league flexed the Denver-Los Angeles game last season from Sunday, Dec. 22, to Thursday, Dec. 19, The Athletic spoke and messaged with dozens of Chargers fans whose plans had been impacted by the change.\nOne fan, August Sage, said he had planned to attend the game with his son, Gabe, who is in the Army and stationed in Kansas. Gabe\u2019s military leave started on Dec. 20, according to Sage, so they could not attend the game after it was flexed.\nAdvertisement\nThis was just one of several examples of affected plans. NFL executive vice president of media distribution Hans Schroder said Monday that the league anticipated disruption with local ticket holders when they announced the flex. A question that went unanswered in Monday\u2019s news conference: What message does this send to those Chargers fans whose plans were disrupted? \u2014 Daniel Popper\n(Photo: Nick Cammett / Getty Images)"

      "text": "NFL owners discussed and voted on a proposed change to flex scheduling procedures at the annual meetings in Arizona in March 2023. Ratings had been underwhelming in the first year of \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, and the proposed change would allow the league to flex games from Sunday to Thursday night.\nAdvertisement\nIt failed by two votes. But that did not stop New York Giants owner John Mara from unloading on the concept.\n\u201cTo flex a game back to Thursday night, to me, is just abusive,\u201d Mara told reporters then.\nHe added: \u201cAt some point, can we please give some consideration to the people who are coming to our games? People make plans to go to these games weeks and months in advance. And 15 days ahead of time to say, \u2018Sorry, folks, that game you were planning on taking your kids to Sunday at 1, now it\u2019s on Thursday night.\u2019 What are we thinking about?\u201d\nGiants owner John Mara is not a fan of the TNF flex scheduling proposal.\n\"To flex a game back to Thursday night to me is just abusive.\"\n\ud83c\udfa5 @charlottecrrllpic.twitter.com/CX0FCBpc2x\n\u2014 The Athletic NFL (@TheAthleticNFL) March 29, 2023\nThe proposal passed two months later despite Mara\u2019s vocal opposition. And now, for the first time, his hypothetical is a reality. The Los Angeles Chargers face the Denver Broncos on Thursday night at SoFi Stadium. The game initially had been scheduled for a 1:05 p.m. local start on Sunday, Dec. 22. The league announced on Nov. 22 that the game had been flexed to Thursday night. And fans who had been planning to attend the game \u2014 some for months in advance, as Mara predicted \u2014 were left scrambling to deal with the disruption.\nThe proposal approved in May 2023 stated any Thursday night flex required 28 days\u2019 notice from the league office. The final item in the resolution stated that the Sunday-to-Thursday flex scheduling would only be in effect for 2023 unless the flex scheduling was not applied that season. It was not. And so, as the resolution stated, the flex scheduling remained in effect for 2024.\nThe Chargers-Broncos game is the first time it has been enacted.\nChargers fan August Sage said he was planning to attend the game on Dec. 22 with his son, Gabe, who is in the Army and stationed in Kansas. Gabe\u2019s military leave starts on Dec. 20, according to Sage, and he was going to head home to Beaumont, Calif., for the holidays. The timing worked out for father and son to attend the Dec. 22 game together. Sage said he only gets to see his son, at most, twice a year. Now, the game has been flexed to a day before Gabe\u2019s military leave and they will not be attending the game.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing,\u201d Sage said.\nThe NFL did not respond to a request for comment for this story. In March 2023, before the proposal passed, commissioner Roger Goodell said, \u201cThere isn\u2019t anybody in any of our organizations that doesn\u2019t put our fans first.\u201d\nGO DEEPER\nHow Chargers respond to Bucs beatdown will decide fate of Jim Harbaugh's debut season\nJustin Kroepfl said he received tickets to the Dec. 22 game as a birthday gift from his wife, Brittany.\nKroepfl, Brittany and their three kids live in Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho. The couple is originally from San Diego, and Kroepfl said he and his family travel back to Southern California for the holidays each year. They attend a Chargers game if they can swing it. They last attended a game on Jan. 2, 2022, when the Chargers beat the Broncos. Kroepfl said Brittany bought tickets this year for the whole family, including sons Landon (14 years old) and Caleb (10) and daughter Amelia (6).\nLandon is a Chargers \u201cdiehard,\u201d Kroepfl said.\n\u201cHe cries after every loss,\u201d Kroepfl added. \u201cHe gets that from me.\u201d\nKroepfl said he saw the announcement on Nov. 22. Their flights were slated to leave Idaho on Friday morning, Dec. 20.\n\u201cHoliday season, you can\u2019t change flights,\u201d Kroepfl said. \u201cWe\u2019re a family of five, so it\u2019s not exactly the cheapest or easiest thing to do.\u201d\nBrittany was forced to sell the tickets and even that was a hassle. Kroepfl said they bought the tickets on GameTime, a secondary market service, and that site will not let them resell the tickets until the day of the game. Brittany posted on Facebook, and found someone willing to \u201cwait until the day of the game and hope that we were telling the truth,\u201d Kroepfl said. Brittany passed along screenshots of her receipts for confirmation.\nKroepfl\u2019s birthday present was ruined. Landon and his siblings must wait at least another year to see their favorite team.\n\u201cThey\u2019re huge Charger fans,\u201d Kroepfl said. \u201cSo we just had to get them jerseys and stuff for Christmas instead.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMichael Japser had planned a reunion with high school friends he grew up with in San Diego. The group is spread out now. Four remain in San Diego. But one is in Charlotte, N.C. One is in St. Louis. Another lives in Austin, Texas.\nJasper said the friends try to see a Chargers game every year around Christmas break. The Broncos game, on Dec. 22, \u201cended up working out great for us,\u201d Jasper said.\nThe friends discussed the reunion \u201cfor months,\u201d according to Jasper. In November, Jasper said he bought seven tickets for the group on Ticketmaster. He also bought two parking passes so the friends could tailgate.\nThat plan was shattered two days later when the league announced the flex to Thursday night. The out-of-town friends were not arriving until Friday or Saturday. The group in San Diego, including Jasper, could not get off work.\nJasper said he called Ticketmaster. Their response, he said, was that there is a disclaimer on the website indicating the game could be flexed. Jasper said a \u201ctiny little disclaimer \u2026 is not enough to justify what they did.\u201d\n\u201cThis is like consumer abuse, essentially,\u201d Jasper said.\nJasper said he had to sell the tickets in bunches and lost money in the ordeal.\n\u201cIt was a total bummer,\u201d Jasper said. \u201cThis is something that we look forward to months in advance. \u2026 For some of my buddies, this was their only time to go to a Charger game, the people that were out of town. This was their only opportunity to go to a Charger game because they\u2019re only in town for a week for Christmas and New Year\u2019s with the family. So they got screwed.\u201d\nChargers fan Carson Trigueiro said he bought three tickets to the game. Trigueiro said he is a law student at USC and the Dec. 22 game fell during his winter break. He made plans to attend the game with two friends, one former college baseball teammate who is in grad school in Minnesota and another childhood friend who lives in Fresno, Calif.\nAdvertisement\nWhen the flex was announced, Trigueiro said he was stuck with three tickets he could not use. He had already committed to watching his sister play in a basketball game at College of the Sequoias in Visalia, Calif. His friend from Minnesota was not arriving until Saturday. His friend from Fresno could not take off work.\nTrigueiro bought the tickets on SeatGeek, another secondary market service. He received the tickets Monday morning, and when he talked to The Athletic over the phone Monday afternoon, he said he was still trying to sell them.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not guys that I get to see too often, just because we\u2019re all in different places and doing different things,\u201d Trigueiro said. \u201cI was looking forward to hanging out with them. And also just kind of being at a game, I\u2019ve been watching every Sunday but have not been able to go just being busy, and I was looking forward to finally getting there. Be loud and be a part of it.\u201d\nChargers fan Mackenzie Logan, who lives in San Diego, had planned for the Dec. 22 game to be a \u201cbig old\u201d birthday get-together for her mom, Stefanie.\nStefanie\u2019s birthday is Dec. 22. \u201cThe holidays always get in the way of the whole birthday thing for her,\u201d Logan said of her mom. This was a chance for Stefanie to have a true standalone birthday, and 14 family members planned to attend.\nNow only seven can make it. Logan said her girlfriend could not take off work.\n\u201cIt was just the biggest bummer,\u201d Logan said.\nBroncos fan Greg Wellesley said, \u201cIt was kind of a shock\u201d when he found out the tickets, flights and hotel room he booked around a game scheduled for a Sunday was now being played on Thursday.\nWellesley, an eighth-grade social studies teacher in the Denver area, had considered the possibility of a flex when he finalized his travel. Initially, he planned to fly out of Los Angeles late Sunday night, but as he looked at the schedule, he realized the Broncos and Chargers could be candidates to be moved to the \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d stage.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cSo I said, \u2018We better extend out a few hours (and leave on Monday) so we\u2019re OK,'\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking that Thursday was a thing.\u201d\nThe flex back to Thursday required more significant changes, ranging from inconvenient to costly. The game being on Thursday meant taking two days off work, just before school let out for a two-week winter break, a prospect he had hoped to avoid when he originally planned his outbound departure late Friday night.\nWellesley\u2019s scheduled flight out of Los Angeles on Monday is heading to Boston, where he\u2019ll spend the Christmas holiday with his in-laws, so to avoid having to rework those long-cemented plans, he\u2019ll instead be spending the three days following the Broncos\u2019 game in the Los Angeles area.\n\u201cIt ends up being a few extra hotel nights in L.A., which is a good thing in the sense of an unplanned, extended vacation, but also it\u2019s an expense we weren\u2019t necessarily planning for,\u201d Wellesley said. \u201cSo that\u2019s kind of a bummer.\u201d\nThe Broncos had the option of declining this flex because it will be their second road Thursday night game of the season. The Chargers did not have this same option, according to a person familiar with the scheduling procedure. This will be the Chargers\u2019 first Thursday night game of the season.\nGO DEEPER\n'We have to run the ball better': Broncos know what must improve in playoff push\nThe Broncos relished the opportunity to switch the rest advantage between themselves and their Week 17 opponent, the Cincinnati Bengals. The Bengals were previously scheduled to play the Cleveland Browns on Thursday, giving Cincinnati the extra days of rest before it hosts Denver on Dec. 28. It will now be the Broncos who get that added rest.\nPlus, playing two games in four days is less of a strain when you\u2019re still relatively fresh off your bye week. The Broncos had theirs in Week 14. The Chargers were off way back in Week 5, which preceded their 23-16 win against the Broncos in Denver on Oct. 13.\nBroncos coach Sean Payton also isn\u2019t pretending he doesn\u2019t enjoy a national stage.\n\u201cIf you are wanting to play significant games in December and January, then just tell us where and when,\u201d Payton said.\nAdvertisement\nWhen asked about the scheduling change in November, Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh said, \u201cWhatever\u2019s good for the league.\u201d\nJasper said he and his three friends who still reside in San Diego were able to buy tickets to the Chargers\u2019 40-17 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday.\nIn a group chat, those at the game sent pictures to the out-of-town friends who lost their chance to see the Chargers because of the flex scheduling.\n\u201cWow, we\u2019re so jealous,\u201d the friends responded. \u201cThis should have been us next weekend.\u201d\n(Photo of Justin Herbert trying to evade Jonathon Cooper in a 2023 game: Gary A.

      "text": "The NFL\u2019s most friendly head coach might just be Brian Schottenheimer. He never seems to be in a bad mood and he\u2019s usually very kind in his interactions with anyone he encounters.\nThat\u2019s why it was surprising to hear him yell the following during a late-July training camp practice: \u201cYou want to fight, let\u2019s f\u2014\u2014 fight! Get your ass on the sideline!\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWas that really Brian Schottenheimer?\nThe new Dallas Cowboys head coach had seen enough of the punches being thrown after a couple of training camp skirmishes.\nSchottenheimer was so angry that he ended practice early and had the team run sideline-to-sideline sprints.\nThe team responded to his message. That was pretty much it for the camp punches.\n\u201cI feel like that was really necessary,\u201d Cowboys All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb said. \u201cI honestly like what he\u2019s doing, because we need discipline.\u201d\nLamb said Schottenheimer\u2019s message to the team about that incident was a question: Do you want to be champions?\n\u201cBecause throughout the years of us being here, talent was never the problem for us,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cIt was always discipline. How do we get ahead and not behind? How do we not shoot ourselves in the foot? How do we not hurt ourselves? Obviously, when the momentum is going our way, we need to continue to keep our foot on the pedal, make the right play and always think about the team.\u201d\nWhile Schottenheimer would probably prefer to be the upbeat coach who is one of the guys all of the time, on that day, he showed a glimpse of the side that is required of a head coach.\n\u201cThis is his opportunity,\u201d Cowboys vice president of player personnel Will McClay told The Athletic. \u201cThis is his shot. He\u2019s the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys. He realizes that opportunity, and he wants to get us beyond that point. It\u2019s on his shoulders. He\u2019s the same dude, but there\u2019s a little bit more that he\u2019s responsible for. He\u2019s still the same person, but he learned from his dad. I think the big thing about it is the buck stops with him and he realizes his responsibility and he\u2019s going to hold people accountable as well as himself.\u201d\nAs most probably already know, Schottenheimer\u2019s father, Marty, was a long-time successful NFL coach. He won 200 games \u2014 the eighth-most in league history. Since 2001, aside from spending 2015 as offensive coordinator for the Georgia Bulldogs, Schottenheimer has been in the NFL in various assistant roles.\nAdvertisement\nHe came to Dallas as a coaching consultant in 2022 before being elevated to offensive coordinator in 2023. After two years in that role, Schottenheimer, 51, became a first-time head coach in January.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been awesome because he\u2019s waited for this opportunity,\u201d McClay said. \u201cHe was the Wonder kid before the Wonder Kids that never got (that opportunity). So he\u2019s very, very genuine, very honest, very open. I think in 2025, with the way the world is, there are certain ways that you have to address these young men and hit them head on and treat them like men and hold them accountable, and really care about people, so it\u2019s very, very uplifting to see that and see the effect that it has not only on the team, but hopefully bringing the organization together again, more so the culture is all the way through that winning culture.\u201d\nSomething that immediately impressed McClay about Schottenheimer is the way he went about filling out his staff \u2014 he didn\u2019t just hire friends he worked with at previous stops. Those hires included bringing in four coaches with no NFL experience: WR coach Junior Adams, OL coach Conor Riley, defensive assistant J.J. Clark and defensive assistant Tanzel Smart.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to build a scouting staff,\u201d McClay said, \u201cI\u2019m going to find the guys that I know. That mindset is typically how it is. But if you want to get better, you go outside of that. So he didn\u2019t hire guys that he\u2019s known for a long time. He went out to find the best. He went out and added young coaches, coaches who have been in college. That tells you a lot about what he\u2019s trying to bring.\n\u201cHe\u2019s always advancing. Open up your minds, figure it out, let\u2019s see if we can figure out a way to do things better and differently than we\u2019ve done before. That\u2019s the way he\u2019s built a staff. I think it\u2019s really huge.\u201d\n| YEAR | TEAM | TITLE |\n|---|---|---|\n2025 | Head coach | |\n2023-24 | Offensive coordinator | |\n2022 | Coaching analyst | |\n2021 | Passing game coordinator | |\n2018-2020 | Offensive coordinator | |\n2016-17 | Quarterbacks coach | |\n2015 | OC and QBs coach | |\n2012-14 | Offensive coordinator | |\n2006-11 | Offensive coordinator | |\n2002-05 | Quarterbacks coach | |\n2001 | Quarterbacks coach | |\n2000 | Tight ends coach | |\n1999 | Wide receivers coach | |\n1998 | Assistant | |\n1997 | Assistant |\nSchottenheimer has been open about not coaching the same way his father did in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. He believes his style is more similar to that of Washington Commanders coach Dan Quinn and Las Vegas Raiders coach Pete Carroll.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe way we practice and the way I act at practice, my father is looking down from heaven going: \u2018What are you doing? That\u2019s not how you practice,\u2019\u201d Schottenheimer said. \u201cBut my father also coached a long time ago. And the type of athletes and type of young men that we are dealing with has changed. I believe that it\u2019s the coach\u2019s responsibility, first and foremost, to create a great practice environment.\u201d\nThat environment has changed from the last five seasons under Mike McCarthy. The music is much more prevalent and louder. While Schottenheimer is also the team\u2019s offensive play caller, he\u2019s made it a point to interact with every player during practice. Every practice he works his way through the pre-practice stretching lines, making sure to greet each player with a handshake or hand slap. He also spends time watching multiple position groups and even the players rehabbing off to the side.\nBrian Schottenheimer very happy to have Micah Parsons here pic.twitter.com/AcOJGJD8cd\n\u2014 Jon Machota (@jonmachota) July 22, 2025\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guy that holds people accountable,\u201d running backs coach Derrick Foster said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not the players, it\u2019s the coaches as well. The level of professionalism that he\u2019s displayed and the communication piece, there\u2019s a whole list of things that he\u2019s doing really well. \u2026 When you have a head coach like that, it\u2019s easy to kind of follow, especially when you understand his vision and the direction he wants to take this team.\u201d\nHe has taken the team to play paintball, added a basketball hoop in the team meeting room and a ping pong table in the locker room. Instead of having the rookies sing in front of the team at training camp, he had them host a \u201crookie show\u201d where he \u201cwas one of the hot topics.\u201d Rookie linebacker Justin Barron impersonated Schottenheimer by wearing his trademark visor and doing his best impression of the head coach accidentally swearing during the team prayer, which Schottenheimer did after their preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have fun and we\u2019re gonna work,\u201d Schottenheimer said. \u201cYou can do both. In 1985, maybe people thought you couldn\u2019t do both. But we can. And we\u2019ve proved that. We\u2019re gonna prove that when you see us win a lot of football games.\u201d\nHe hasn\u2019t been shy about making bold statements. He told Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones when he was hired that no one would outwork him. He declared that not only will the Cowboys win with him as head coach but that they will be so successful that their coaching staff will get \u201craided\u201d by other teams. And then at the news conference to kick off the start of training camp, Schottenheimer said: \u201cWhen we win a Super Bowl, my dad will get a ring.\u201d\nAs difficult as it might be at times as an NFL head coach, Schottenheimer wants to stay as genuine as possible. He has been emotional several times over the last few months. He shed tears with Jones before his first preseason game as head coach. He got choked up Tuesday when talking about telling defensive tackle Perrion Winfrey that he made the 53-man roster. He was also very open at training camp while sharing his battle with thyroid cancer when he was 28.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWhat a blessing it is for me to be here,\u201d Cowboys defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that because he\u2019s my boss. His leadership has been incredible to the team. His accountability for us and also for the players has been incredible. His energy, his positivity has been incredible.\n\u201cThis is my fifth franchise. Becoming a head coach, that\u2019s a daunting task. There\u2019s a lot. And I admire the way he\u2019s handled everything. Definitely, definitely thankful that he selected me to be here with him.\u201d\nSchottenheimer doesn\u2019t believe in having a new team slogan each year. He just has one: \u201cCompete every day.\u201d It\u2019s on shirts and backpacks around the team\u2019s headquarters. The large sign above the walkway leading from the locker room to the team cafeteria changed every year under McCarthy. It was a spot to put that year\u2019s team slogan. It has been changed to show a picture of players huddled up with this sentence above it: \u201cOur team will be driven by our competitive spirit and love for one another.\u201d\n\u201cPhenomenal leader,\u201d Riley said. \u201cVery consistent in his messaging and his discipline. And you look at it and the challenges of being a head coach at this level and his consistency, it\u2019s very, very admirable. And then from an offensive mind, the word that comes to mind is brilliant.\u201d\nHad McCarthy remained head coach or the Cowboys had hired someone other than Schottenheimer, there\u2019s a good chance he would have remained as offensive coordinator and play caller. That part of his coaching had Jones most interested. Jones started thinking about the possibility of Schottenheimer as Dallas\u2019 next head coach after the two had offseason discussions about the offense.\nSchottenheimer knows that\u2019s his strength. He\u2019s gone out of his way to not show much during practices of the preseason. The season opener next Thursday night (8:20 p.m. ET, NBC) in Philadelphia against the NFC East rival Eagles is expected to include several wrinkles that haven\u2019t been shown to reporters or the public.\n\u201cAn exciting offense,\u201d Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott said this week when asked what to expect. \u201cWe\u2019ve kept it vanilla for a reason. Excited about getting out there and putting it all on display next Thursday.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nOf course, the biggest storyline heading into Week 1 remains whether or not Dallas\u2019 top player, All-Pro pass rusher Micah Parsons, will play. Schottenheimer has handled Parsons\u2019 contract situation well and has done some of his best work not saying anything to offend the team\u2019s owner or top player.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very impressed with just how he\u2019s been building a relationship with me,\u201d Parsons said in June. \u201cI would say it\u2019s different because, especially when you have an offensive coach, they don\u2019t tend to like want to reach out (to defensive players) and check in on them daily or monthly to see how your training is going, asking where are you going (on vacation), calling you on your birthday. \u2026\n\u201cBut constantly, since he\u2019s been hired, reaching out with me, building that relationship with me, going above and beyond, inviting my family places, showing up to my events, things like that. Honestly, kudos to him. That\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think is easy to do because you don\u2019t know how certain people would accept it, but I think he\u2019s accepted his role pretty well, and I think he has everyone excited around here.\u201d\nSchottenheimer continues to have conversations with Parsons. He expects him to be on the field against the Eagles. If Parsons doesn\u2019t have a new contract and still plays in the season opener, the culture Schottenheimer is building deserves some credit.\nHe\u2019ll ultimately be judged on wins and losses, but up to this point, Schottenheimer has appeared deserving of the biggest opportunity of his career.\n\u201cI promised myself when I got this opportunity that I wouldn\u2019t change,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I think I\u2019ve seen too many people change. The guys I\u2019ve seen change, they weren\u2019t very successful. And I plan on being really successful.\u201d\n(Top photo: Kevin Jairaj / Getty Images)"

      "text": "The NFL and ESPN reached a blockbuster agreement that will place many of the league\u2019s top media holdings with the sports network in exchange for equity in ESPN that is potentially worth billions, sources briefed on the agreement told The Athletic.\nAn official announcement is expected next week. Disney, ESPN\u2019s parent company, has its earnings call on Wednesday.\nAdvertisement\nESPN and the NFL declined comment.\nThe discussions about the monumental deal were on and off for four years and have resulted in what is said to be a complicated agreement, according to the sources. ESPN is expected to have access to RedZone, NFL Network, seven more regular-season games, the NFL\u2019s fantasy football business, as well as the potential to integrate special features (including betting) and potentially more assets.\nThe agreement coincides with ESPN\u2019s forthcoming direct-to-consumer service that will formally launch in the next few weeks.\nThe service, which will cost $29.99 per month, will allow subscribers to bypass cable or satellite providers to watch all ESPN programming, including live games, through ESPN\u2019s app. Viewers who already have access to ESPN\u2019s networks through cable, satellite or bundled streaming TV services will also be able to watch ESPN through the new app.\nDisney/ESPN will likely announce an official release date for the revamped ESPN app and DTC service, which is called \u201cESPN,\u201d next week. ESPN has marketed the service as the \u201cNext Era\u201d for the network.\nSince ESPN began its planning for the new service, network executives have held talks with many potential partners from major leagues to top digital players, though the NFL has long been considered its top target. ESPN and the NFL already have a strong relationship. The network is the home of \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d and airs a total of 25 games per year. ESPN pays the NFL around $2.7 billion per year and has the rights to two Super Bowls in 2027 and 2031.\nAs evidenced by how long the discussions dragged on, the contractual language is said to be complicated. The NFL may receive up to 10 percent of ESPN equity, sources confirmed. That detail was reported previously by CNBC. There could be a term length to the agreement, according to one person briefed on the agreement, but it is not yet known how that will be prescribed.\nAdvertisement\nThe NFL has been looking to unload many of its NFL Media properties for years. NFL Network was started in 2003 and was looked upon as a potential competitor to ESPN. While it gained traction and distribution, it never became a full-blown alternative to ESPN, whose studio shows focus more attention on the NFL than any other sport.\nNFL Network was plagued by cutbacks for years, even though the league is a multibillion-dollar juggernaut. ESPN is expected to invest in improving NFL Network programming, according to sources briefed on its plans.\nIn the ESPN family of networks, NFL Network could be looked upon similarly to the SEC Network. The SEC offers programming 24/7 about the league, while ESPN, the main channel, dedicates significant airtime to it as well. The same sort of setup, with on-air personalities being used across brands, is very possible.\nFor the NFL, the deal would divest the league from the TV production business and allow it to focus more intently on mining its core IP, all while acquiring a meaningful stake in one of its most important media partners, swapping the receding value of NFL Media for the higher growth potential of ESPN\u2019s business; the NFL having a vested interest in ESPN\u2019s financial health will seemingly increase the value of ESPN on its face.\nThe ESPN-NFL deal will require regulatory approval, which could take nine months to a year. If it goes into effect next season, it would be part of a big year for ESPN as the 2026-27 year ends with the network broadcasting its first Super Bowl. The game will also be on ABC, which Disney also owns.\nRedZone is of particular importance to the deal. The idea of packaging it with ESPN\u2019s existing channels \u2014 which already receive more than $10 per month from subscribers to cable, satellite and services like YouTube TV and Fubo \u2014 in forthcoming carriage negotiations is seen as vital. RedZone is a service that allows fans to see the live action of all the scoring opportunities during Sunday afternoon games from around the NFL. ESPN would be expected to make it available through its app, although how it would be priced is not yet known.\nAdvertisement\nThe NFL\u2019s current media-rights deals to televise its games are worth more than $110 billion over 11 seasons. The league has opt-out clauses with its partners for the end of the decade. This agreement does not impact them.\nFor ESPN, the NFL has been instrumental in its dominance for years. As an eight-year-old network in 1987, it first secured rights to televise eight NFL games per season, which changed the trajectory of how many cable and satellite subscribers wanted to watch ESPN \u2014 along with how much ESPN could charge cable and satellite operators.\nHowever, like all networks reliant on cable distribution, ESPN has been hit hard by cable-cutting and \u201ccable nevers.\u201d Cable-cutters stopped paying for the service, while cable nevers are made up of young people who have bypassed cable entirely. ESPN was in more than 100 million cable homes in 2011. Toward the end of 2024, that figure had dropped to 65.3 million, according to Nielsen.\nESPN had already started a direct-to-consumer service called ESPN+, which featured UFC fights, lower-tier college sports and a smattering of other offerings. The network said that the service has 22.5 million subscribers.\nWith the upgraded ESPN app offering all of the programming from its networks and ESPN+, it hopes first to stop the subscription-loss trend.\n(Photo: Mike Windle / Getty Images for ESPN)"
