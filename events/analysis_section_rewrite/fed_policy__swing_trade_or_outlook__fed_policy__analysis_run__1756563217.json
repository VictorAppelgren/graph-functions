      "feedback": "The draft is overly verbose, mixes multiple assets (dxy, ust10y, spx) without a clear causal chain, and repeats the same Fed‑cut narrative, diluting focus. Tighten the narrative to a single swing‑trade thesis on the **USD/DXY**: 1) explicitly map each driver to DXY with sign and magnitude (e.g., 25‑bp cut → –200 bp, 2‑yr/10‑yr flatten <30 bp → +70 bp) and cite IDs; 2) collapse redundant “Fed cut” paragraphs into one concise paragraph that links policy, yield spread, and DXY; 3) remove all UST10Y and SPX commentary unless directly tied to DXY transmission (e.g., equity risk‑premium link) and provide a brief causal note; 4) replace generic “weak labor market” with specific data (e.g., NFP 200 k on 2025‑08‑31) and cite ID; 5) quantify probabilities only for the 25‑bp cut (89 %) and for the DXY move (≈200 bp) and give a single probability for the trade; 6) add a clear invalidation trigger (e.g., “PCE > 3.0 % on 2025‑08‑30” with ID) and a secondary trigger (tariff reversal); 7) remove all non‑canonical handles (e.g., “US core PCE” without mapping to a handle) and focus on DXY; 8) ensure the final output follows the 4‑line movers format and a single swing‑trade line with entry, stop, target, R/R, and confidence. This will satisfy the 1‑line swing‑trade requirement, keep the analysis within the 100‑topic limit, and provide a defensible, actionable thesis.",
