  "description": "The 2025 Ryder Cup U.S. team is set. Here is a list of golfers that surprisingly did not make the team.",
  "content": "The 2025 U.S. Ryder Cup team has been selected, with captain Keegan Bradley's final six picks forming the final 12-player team that will face off against Team Europe in the highly anticipated golf event at Bethpage Black in New York, just a month away.\n\nThe automatic qualifiers for Team U.S. include World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who will lead the team alongside rookie J.J. Spaun. Other players securing their spots are Xander Schauffele, Russell Henley, Harris English and Bryson DeChambeau. These players earned their spots through a combination of their world rankings, performance in major tournaments, and points accumulated in the Ryder Cup standings.\n\nU.S. captain Keegan Bradley, who chose not to play and will focus solely on his captaincy, has also selected Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa, Ben Griffin, Cameron Young, Patrick Cantlay and Sam Burns to complete the team with their ultimate goal is to reclaim the Ryder Cup trophy.\n\nHere are the handful of Team USA snubs that did not make the Ryder Cup team this time around, a moment of disappointment for these golfers.\n\nDespite a stellar season in 2025, where he made 20 cuts in 24 events \u2014 including a runner-up finish at The Genesis Invitational and third-place finishes at the Valero Texas Open, RBC Heritage, and the BMW Championship \u2014 McNealy was ultimately not selected as a captain's pick for the Ryder Cup. Although he landed in the top 10 of the Ryder Cup standings based on points, as the highest-ranked player not to make the team, it didn't make a difference in the final selection.\n\nDespite being part of the 2023 Ryder Cup team, where he recorded a 2-2-0 record and finished No. 12 in this year's Ryder Cup standings, Harman was not selected to return to the Ryder Cup team. Throughout the season, he achieved 10 top-25 finishes, which included a victory at the Valero Texas Open and an eighth-place finish at the Travelers Championship.\n\nNovak secured the 13th position in the Ryder Cup standings, placing ahead of three players who were selected for this year's Ryder Cup team. He finished the season with five top-10 finishes, including his sole victory at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans.\n\nFowler is a five-time U.S. Ryder Cup veteran and has been a part of three Presidents Cup teams. In 2023, he was selected as a captain's pick but had a limited role, only playing on the final day of the competition. Unfortunately, he lost his singles match to Tommy Fleetwood. Fowler finished in 30th place in the Ryder Cup standings this year. However, he ended his season on a high note, tying for sixth at the FedEx St. Jude Championship and tying for seventh at the BMW Championship. Despite these strong finishes, it was not enough for him to secure a captain's pick.\n\nSpieth has been part of five Ryder Cup teams and four Presidents Cup teams, but his recent performance in 2025 was disappointing. After undergoing left wrist surgery last year, he has been working hard to regain his form. Despite the challenges, Spieth still achieved four top-10 finishes this season.\n\nThe biggest stories, every morning.

      "text": "When is 2025 Ryder Cup? Dates, schedule, history of U.S.-Europe golf tournament\nThe 45th edition of the biennial Ryder Cup tournament is set to begin in less than a month.\nWith the 2025 PGA Tour season officially behind us, it's time to start looking ahead for the Americans' opportunity to earn revenge on those pesky Europeans after Tommy Fleetwood won the FedEx Cup for England.\nThe United States is sure to have a stacked roster with six of the twelve competitors having already been decided based on Ryder Cup points. Those qualifiers include Scottie Scheffler, Bryson DeChambeau, Xander Schauffele, Harris English, and Ryder Cup rookies J.J. Spaun and Russell Henley. Those six alone should be enough to ruffle a few feathers across the pond, but captain Keegan Bradley also has the opportunity to pick six more players of his own, and he has a stellar assortment to choose from.\nBetween Collin Morikawa, Maverick McNealy and Justin Thomas, Bradley has a tough decision ahead. In fact, he could even opt to throw himself in the ring, which President Trump urged him to do on Aug. 24. It's not unprecedented, but Bradley would become the first player-captain to lead the Americans at the Ryder Cup since Arnold Palmer in 1963.\nRegardless of who Bradley chooses, the dates and the venue are set. The Ryder Cup always brings a layer of excitement, drama and togetherness for golf fans across the continents, and 2025 should be no different.\nHere's everything to know about the schedule for this year's tournament.\nWhen is the 2025 Ryder Cup?\nThe Ryder Cup will be held Sept. 26-28 on the Black Course of Bethpage State Park in Farmingdale, New York. That course has hosted golf's U.S. Open twice. It was also the venue for the 2019 PGA Championship.\nThe first two days of the tournament will feature four-ball and foursome matches. The final day of the tournament will consist entirely of singles play, 12 matches in total for Sunday.\nHow to watch Ryder Cup: TV channels, streaming\nThe official TV schedule for the event has not yet been announced, but NBC has the rights to the event. NBC, Golf Channel and USA Network could all carry the event. On streaming platforms, Peacock and Fubo are the best bets for interested viewers.\nStream the 2025 Ryder Cup with Fubo\nRyder Cup history\nWhile America does hold a 27-15 advantage all-time against the Europeans, Europe has won 12 of the past 22 tournaments, eight of the past 11, and five of the past seven. In short, they've dominated in recent years.\nThat said, the United States tends to always compete, even in their losses. The largest deficit the United States ever endured in a Ryder Cup tournament was nine (2004, 2006). On the other side, the United States has won by as many as 15 points (1967). As recently as 2021, the United States has won by 10 points, which is obviously greater than the largest victory in European history."

      "text": "Keegan Bradley makes Ryder Cup captain's picks: Why he didn't choose himself\n- U.S. Ryder Cup Captain Keegan Bradley announced his six captain's picks, opting not to select himself as a playing captain.\n- The 2025 Ryder Cup will be held at Bethpage Black in New York from September 26-28.\n- European captain Luke Donald will announce his picks on Sept. 1.\nThe eyes of the golf world were on Keegan Bradley on Wednesday morning.\nFor a year now, ever since Bradley was named the captain of the United States team for the 2025 Ryder Cup, his six captain's picks \u2013 and the possibility he could pick himself as a playing captain \u2013 loomed as a defining storyline for this edition of the biennial team event pitting the best from the U.S. and Europe. Bradley called it the biggest decision of his life.\nBut with less than a month to go before the match-play action gets underway at Bethpage Black Golf Course in Farmingdale, New York, Bradley chose not to make history. In fact, he made the choice awhile ago, he said, \"and I'm glad it's over.\"\nBradley announced his captain's picks during a news conference from PGA of America headquarters in Frisco, Texas, and did not make himself the first playing captain since Arnold Palmer in 1963. Instead, Bradley added Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa, Ben Griffin, Cameron Young, Patrick Cantlay and Sam Burns as captain's pick to the United States team's six automatic qualifiers.\n\"The decision was made awhile ago that I wasn't playing. The last 48 hours or so we had the team set. We weren't scrambling at all,\" Bradley said. \"This was a really tough decision. I would say there was a point this year where I was playing awhile ago, and all these guys stepped up in a major way and played their way on this team. That's something that I'm really proud of and something that I really wanted.\"\nBradley was ranked 11th in Ryder Cup points after the 2025 PGA Tour season and won the 2025 Travelers Championship. Young (14), Cantlay (15) and Burns (16) all finished below him in the standings. Maverick McNealy (10), Brian Harman (12) and Andrew Novak (13) were the highest-ranked American golfers to not be selected based on Ryder Cup points.\n\"It broke my heart not to play,\" Bradley added, \"because you work forever to make these teams, but ultimately I was chosen to do a job. I was chosen to be the captain of this team and my ultimate goal when I started this thing was to be the best captain I could be, and this is how I felt I could do this. If we got to this point and I felt like the team was better with me on it, I was going to do it. I was going to do whatever I thought was best for this team, and I know 100 percent for certain this is the best choice.\"\nThe 2025 Ryder Cup begins with foursome and four-ball matches on Friday, Sept. 26 at Bethpage Black, with the United States attempting to recover on home soil after Europe won the Ryder Cup convincingly in 2023. Europe has won five of the past seven Ryder Cups, but has not won in the United States since 2012.\nEurope captain Luke Donald is scheduled to announce his six captain's picks on Monday, Sept. 1 at 9 a.m. ET on Golf Channel. Here's a breakdown of the United States captain's picks, as well as the Ryder teams, date and format:\nRyder Cup 2025 US captain's picks\n- Justin Thomas\n- Collin Morikawa\n- Ben Griffin\n- Cameron Young\n- Patrick Cantlay\n- Sam Burns\n2025 Ryder Cup teams\nUnited States\n- Scottie Scheffler*\n- J.J.

      "text": "FedEx St. Jude Championship highlights: Justin Rose wins on third playoff hole\n- Justin Rose edged 2025 breakout golfer J.J. Spaun to win the FedEx St. Jude Championship.\n- Tommy Fleetwood, who entered Sunday's play with the lead, finished tied for third with Scottie Scheffler.\n- Next week, the PGA Tour goes to Caves Valley Golf Club in in Baltimore County, Maryland, for the BMW Championship.\nTommy Fleetwood entered the final round of the 2025 FedEx St. Jude Championship at the top of the leaderboard.\nThe Englishman struggled early to start the third round Saturday in Memphis, but did enough to hold the top spot entering play Sunday.\nFleetwood held a three-shot lead over Justin Rose when the second round was completed early on Saturday (second-round action was suspended Friday due to severe weather).\nAt the end of Sunday though, there would be a new leader. In fact, there were two as both Justin Rose and 2025 breakout golfer J.J. Spaun were each tied at 16-under following the 72nd hole of the weekend. They were trailed by both Tommy Fleetwood and Scottie Scheffler who each finished at 15-under.\nThat tie at the top meant fans were in for a playoff, and it didn't disappoint. Both Spaun and Rose lipped out potential tournament-winning putts in the first playoff hole. On the second go, Spaun nailed a very long putt to stay alive. After that, the position of the 18th hole was moved, potentially giving Spaun an advantage considering he'd landed his approach shot on 18 close to the new cup each time he'd played the hole today. However, Rose rose to the occasion landing a similarly well-placed shot, positioning each golfer for a birdie opportunity. Rose nailed his putt. Spaun did not.\nAnd with that, Rose was the winner of the first leg of the FedEx Cup Playoffs. Now, we head to the BMW Championship at Caves Valley in Maryland.\nUSA TODAY Sports provided full final-round coverage of the first event of the FedEx Cup Playoffs \u2014 the St. Jude Championship from Memphis.\nFedEx St. Jude Championship leaderboard\n- 1. Justin Rose -16 (F) *won in third playoff hole\n- 2. J.J. Spaun -16 (F) *lost in third playoff hole\n- T3. Scottie Scheffler -15 (F)\n- T3. Tommy Fleetwood -15 (F)\n- 5. Cameron Young -11 (F)\nFEDEX ST. JUDE CHAMPIONSHIP: Updated tee times, leaderboard\nJustin Rose wins 2025 St. Jude Championship\nIt seems a change in hole position was all that was needed to determine a winner. After several clutch, long putts from J.J. Spaun to maintain pace with Rose, it was a short putt that ultimately doomed him. Rose hit his birdie putt with the hole now on the right side of the green, but Spaun pulled his putt, giving Rose the win.\nOn to the BMW Championship!\nSpaun nails long putt to stay alive\nAfter an exhilarating first playoff hole, it was only fitting that the second run at determining a winner would be just as exciting. After each golfer's second shot though, it looked like it was going to be anticlimactic after Spaun left his approach shot way right, while Rose left his shot just short, only a few feet away from the cup.\nSpaun answered though, sinking the very long putt to put the pressure on Rose, and the crowd went wild.\nRose sank his putt as well, but it had to be disappointing for him. What looked like an easy win for Rose turned into a pair of birdies and trip back to the tee box for a third playoff hole.\nRose, Spaun still knotted after first playoff hole\nThe pair squared off to determine who deserved the victory after tying at -16 through 72 holes. However, one hole was not enough as both golfers notched a par on the first playoff hole. Now they head to 18th for the second playoff hole.\nJustin Rose on fire, moves to share of the lead with J.J. Spaun\nJ.J. Spaun finished with a par on the 18th hole to finish the fourth round with a 5-under 65 and a share of the lead. Spaun is -16 for the tournament, but Justin Rose has one final hole to pass Spaun for the victory. Rose, continued his hot stretch on the back nine, recording his fourth consecutive birdie on hole No. 17 to tie Spaun atop the leaderboard. Scottie Scheffler, meanwhile will finish no worse than third after carding a 3-under 67 for the round and finishing at -15 for the tournament.\nJ.J. Spaun moves into tie for first on leaderboard\nIt's back-to-back birdie putts for J.J. Spaun on the back nine, and he is now tied for first place on the leaderboard with Tommy Fleetwood. Spaun now has six birdies on the day.\nFleetwood miscues a putt on Hole 16\nTommy Fleetwood miscues his chip shot from the grandstands, and it might cost him sole possession of first place on the leaderboard as his shot rolls past the hole and down the side.\nSpaun, Scheffler birdie Hole 16\nHere come J.J. Spaun and Scottie Scheffler as both golfers get the birdie putt to roll in on the par five Hole 16. For Spaun, he is now one stroke behind Tommy Fleetwood at the top of the leaderboard, while Scheffler is now two strokes back on Fleetwood.\nScheffler bogeys 15 to fall two shots back\nA wayward drive down the stretch may have cost Scottie Scheffler this tournament. Scheffler pulled his drive left on the par-4 hole and had to hit a low punch from under a canopy of trees. He ended up over the green and missed a 7-footer for par to drop a crucial shot and fall into a tie for third place with Justin Rose -- two shots behind leader Tommy Fleetwood.\nTommy Fleetwood finally makes a birdie (x2)\nAfter bogeying the first hole and then running off 10 consecutive pars, Tommy Fleetwood finally converted a birdie putt on No. 11. Sitting just on the edge of the green on the par 4, Fleetwood rolled in an improbable 33 footer to join Scottie Scheffler and J.J. Spaun at 14-under for the tournament.\nIt was a pivotal hole for his playing group. Though both Fleetwood and Justin Rose came to the 11th tee at 13-under, Fleetwood's birdie put him in a tie for the lead, while Rose hit his tee shot into the deep rough and had to scramble for bogey.\nAs if the cork had finally been removed from the bottle, Fleetwood followed up his first birdie of the day with a second one on the par-4 13th. Hitting his approach to within 15 feet, he rolled his putt into the center of the cup to take a one-stroke lead.\nJ.J. Spaun makes it a four-way tie for the lead\nReigning U.S. Open champion J.J. Spaun is making things very interesting -- and very jumbled -- as the back nine beckons. Playing alongside Scottie Scheffler, Spaun recorded a third birdie in his first eight holes when he converted a 19-foot putt on the par-3 No. 8.\nFor the moment, that birdie pulled him into a four-way tie for the lead among the quartet of players in the final two groups. They're about to make the turn to the back nine, with more excitement to come.\nScottie Scheffler pulls even after three holes\nThough he began Sunday's final round two strokes off the pace, World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler quickly caught up with third-round leader Tommy Fleetwood.\nFleetwood bogeyed the opening hole to fall to 13-under on the tournament, while Scheffler made a fantastic chip over a bunker on the par-5 third hole for an easy birdie.\nThe current FedEx Cup points leader, Scheffler has won four events this season. Fleetwood is looking for his first career PGA Tour victory.\nJordan Spieth's playoff hopes find watery grave on 18\nSitting right on the borderline of making the top 50 in FedEx Cup points heading into the final hole of the tournament, Jordan Spieth caught a break when his tee shot on No. 18 just barely avoided the rough. However, his approach to the pin -- tucked on the left side of a green guarded by a pond -- landed short, caught the bank and hopped into the water.\nSpieth was unable to hole his chip for par and finished with a bogey for a 3-under 67 -- dropping him to 54th in the stnadings. His playing partner, Denny McCarthy, also shot a 67 and appears to be a lock to finish inside the top 50 and advance.\nRounds of the day: Justin Thomas, Cameron Young\nTwo-time major champion Justin Thomas turned in the early round of the day, shooting a 5-under 65 to jump 22 spots on the leaderboard from his standing after Saturday's third round.\nAfter making the turn at 3-under, Thomas ran off three consecutive birdies to get to 6-under for the tournament, but his momentum stalled over the final six holes. He finished with five pars and a bogey to complete his 65.\nThe PGA champion in 2017 and 2022 won't have to sweat out the final few holes since he'll easily make the field for next week's BMW Championship. He's currently in fifth place in the FedEx Cup standings with the top 50 advancing to the second round of the playoffs.\nUpdate: Playing later in the day, Cameron Young carded five birdies on the front nine and finished with three more over the final four holes on his way to a 6-under 64. In completing his round, Young moved into a tie for fifth place.\nCaddie change for Scottie Scheffler on Sunday\nScottie Scheffler will be without regular caddie Ted Scott by his side for the final round of the 2025 FedEx St. Jude Championship in Memphis.\nScott had to return home for a private family matter, according to a social media post by the PGA Tour. It stated that Brad Payne will fill in for Scott. Payne drove to Memphis from his home in Dallas Saturday night, Golf Channel's Todd Lewis reported. He also noted that Scott left for his home in Louisiana last night.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Payne has been on the bag for Scheffler. He stepped in last year for the third round of the PGA Championship at Valhalla when Scott was given the day off to attend his daughter\u2019s high school graduation. \u2014 Adam Schupak, Golfweek\nDenny McCarthy makes an early run\nWill someone go really low early and threaten the favorites at the top of the FedEx St. Jude leaderboard? Denny McCarthy is making a bid to be that golfer.\nMcCarthy carded two birdies and an eagle on his first four holes to jump 20 spots on the leaderboard to 5-under for the tournament. McCarthy -- a native of Rockville, Maryland -- would love to get into the top 50 in the FedEx Cup standings with the second tournament in the FedEx Cup playoffs next week at Caves Valley in nearby Owings Mills, Maryland.\nHis sizzling start in Memphis currently has him inside the top 50 in points.\nWhat time is the FedEx St. Jude Championship?\nThe 2025 FedEx St. Jude Championship enters the final round on Sunday, Aug. 10. The first tee time on Sunday is 7:45 a.m. ET.\nHow to watch 2025 FedEx St. Jude Championship: TV channel, live streaming, schedule\nThe 2025 FedEx St. Jude Championship, which marks the beginning of the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup Playoffs, will be televised nationally on the Golf Channel and NBC and can also be streamed live across ESPN+, Peacock, and Fubo.\nBelow is the complete broadcast schedule for Sunday's final round:\nAll times Eastern\nSunday, August 10\nWatch FedEx St. Jude Championship with Fubo\nFedEx St. Jude Championship weather\nAfter rain delayed the completion of the second round of the FedEx St. Jude Championship on Friday, there's little to no chance the weather will disrupt Sunday's final round. The AccuWeather forecast for TPC at Southwind in Memphis calls for hot and humid conditions throughout the afternoon and early evening.\nLook for brilliant sunshine throughout the day, with a high of 91 degrees and winds out of the southeast at 6 mph.

      "text": "BMW Championship highlights, results: Scottie Scheffler surges to win\nScottie Scheffler made quite a statement in his bid to repeat as FedEx Cup champion by winning the BMW Championship on Sunday, Aug. 17 by two strokes over Robert MacIntyre.\nScheffler began Sunday's final round four strokes behind MacIntyre, who had held the lead for each of the tournament's first three days at Caves Valley Golf Club in Owings Mills, Maryland.\nThe world's No. 1 player only needed five holes to pull even, took the lead for good with a birdie on No. 7 and holed a spectacular pitch from off the green on 17 to nail down his 18th career PGA Tour victory.\nIn addition to the drama at the top of the leaderboard, the rest of the field was also competing for a top-30 spot in the FedEx Cup points standings in order to secure a spot in the season-ending Tour Championship next weekend.\nUSA TODAY Sports covered all the action from the final round of the BMW Championship. Scroll below for results and highlights:\nBMW Championship leaderboard\n- 1. Scottie Scheffler -15\n- 2. Robert MacIntyre -13\n- 3. Maverick McNealy -11\n- T4. Sam Burns -10\n- T4. Tommy Fleetwood -10\nBMW CHAMPIONSHIP: Full results from final round\nBMW Championship Round 4 highlights\nPrize money payouts for BMW Championship\nThe BMW Championship field split a purse total of $20 million based on the leaderboard results.\nAs winner, Scottie Scheffler earned $3,600,000. Second-place finisher Robert MacIntyre takes home $2,160,000, while third-place finisher Maverick McNealy gets a $1,360,000 prize. \u2014 James H. Williams\nTop 30 finalized for 2025 FedEx Cup Playoffs at East Lake\nLudvig Aberg made the final stroke that decided the top 30 in the FedEx Cup Playoffs standings. It was a two-inch tap-in putt for a double-bogey 6 on the 18th hole. With that, all the points were calculated and confirmed, and that put Akshay Bhatia into the 30th and final spot for the final playoff event. Had he triple bogeyed the final hole, Bhatia would have been bumped to 31st, and Michael Kim would've landed in the 30th spot. \u2014 Todd Kelly, Golfweek\nHere's the top 30 for the 2025 Tour Championship:\n- Scottie Scheffler\n- Rory McIlroy\n- J.J. Spaun\n- Justin Rose\n- Tommy Fleetwood\n- Ben Griffin\n- Russell Henley\n- Sepp Straka\n- Robert MacIntyre\n- Maverick McNealy\n- Harris English\n- Justin Thomas\n- Cameron Young\n- Ludvig Aberg\n- Andrew Novak\n- Keegan Bradley\n- Sam Burns\n- Brian Harman\n- Corey Conners\n- Patrick Cantlay\n- Collin Morikawa\n- Viktor Hovland\n- Hideki Matsuyama\n- Shane Lowry\n- Nick Taylor\n- Harry Hall\n- Jacob Bridgeman\n- Sungjae Im\n- Chris Gotterup\n- Akshay Bhatia\nHole 17: Unbelievable hole-out may seal the deal\nScottie Scheffler continues to do Scottie Scheffler things. And it may have just won him this tournament.\nIn the heavy rough off the tee on the par-3 17th, Scheffler hit his pitch onto the green and watched it roll down the hill toward the hole, 82 feet away. The crowd noise began to swell and the ball picked up speed ... on a direct path toward the hole.\nBang!\nThe birdie gave Scheffler a two-stroke lead with one hole to play.\nHole 15: Scheffler bounces back with a birdie\nHere's a great example of why Scottie Scheffler is the No. 1 player in the world. Coming off a three-putt bogey on the previous hole to see his lead cut to one shot, Scheffler showed his mettle on 15.\nAfter Robert MacIntyre hit his ball seven feet away from the hole for a potential birdie, Scheffler faced a 163-yard approach shot on the par-4 -- and stuck his iron even closer.\nMacIntyre, however, missed his birdie putt. Then Scheffler stepped up and drained it to get back to 14-under for a two-stroke lead.\nHole 14: Uncharacteristic three-putt from Scheffler\nHow quickly things can change.\nRobert MacIntyre looked to be facing a three-shot deficit with four holes to play with Scottie Scheffler lining up an 18-foot birdie putt on the par-4 14th hole. But amazingly, he slid the ball past the cup -- and then appeared to misread the comebacker for par. With a bogey dropping Scheffler back to 13-under, MacIntyre only trails by one shot.\nHole 13: MacIntyre bogeys, trails by two\nA wayward tee shot on the 175-yard par-3 has put Robert MacIntyre behind the proverbial 8 ball. Hitting over water to a left-front pin placement, MacIntyre flew the green into the intermediate rough some 72 feet from the hole. Although he chipped it within seven feet, he missed the par putt to drop back to 12-under for the tournament -- now tied for second place with Sam Burns.\nScottie Scheffler, coming off a birdie at No. 11 and a bogey at No. 12, carded a routine par to stay at minus-14.\nFive holes remain.\nThrough 9 holes: Scheffler leads by one\nAs the final group turns for home at Caves Valley, Scottie Scheffler has the upper hand.\nScheffler pleyed the front nine in 2 under par, while third-round leader Robert MacIntyre was 3-over after both players parred the ninth. Sam Burns, playing one hole ahead, is three behind Scheffler at minus-11.\nRickie Fowler, looking to make the top 30 in FedEx Cup points and advance to the season-ending Tour Championship, is in fourth place at 10-under. Fowler began the tournament in 48th place in the standings, but he's currently projected to move into 25th place if he can hold his position.\nScottie Scheffler surges into the lead\nRobert MacIntyre may be looking for a wire-to-wire win at Caves Valley, but Scottie Scheffler has other ideas.\nAfter making up a four-stroke deficit to begin the final round, the reigning FedEx Cup champion took sole possession of the lead by draining a birdie putt on the par-4 seventh hole. Scheffler got in position by crushing a 326-yard drive down the right side of the fairway and sticking his approach shot to within six feet.\nThrough seven holes, Scheffler stood at 14-under for the tournament, one stroke ahead of McIntyre and three up on Sam Burns.\nAs a side note: Scheffler has finished in the top 8 in each of his last 12 events, the longest such streak on the PGA Tour since Tom Weiskopf had 13 consecutive in 1973.\nScheffler pulls even on front nine\nWell that didn't take long. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler began the final round four shots behind leader Robert MacIntyre, but made up the entire difference in the first five holes.\nScheffler carded birdies on the first and fifth holes (alongside a bogey on No. 3) to get to 13 under par. Meanwhile, MacIntyre opened with bogeys on each of the first three par 4s on the front side (Nos. 1, 2 and 5) to drop into a tie.\nHow to watch BMW Championship: TV channels, streaming\nThe 2025 BMW Championship, the second event of the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup Playoffs, will be televised nationally on the Golf Channel and NBC. It can be live streamed via ESPN+, Peacock and Fubo depending on the time. Here's the broadcast schedule for the final two rounds:\nAll times Eastern\nSunday, Aug. 17\nTommy Fleetwood enjoys some good fortune, for a change\nAfter yet another near-miss last week in an attempt to win his first PGA Tour title, Tommy Fleetwood birdied the second hole, thanks to a quality he's come to embody: patience.\nFleetwood's 28-foot putt on the par 4 hung on the edge of cup for several moments before wobbling and finally dropping in.\nThe early birdie moved Fleetwood into a tie for fourth place, eight shots behind leader Robert MacIntyre.\nHe held the lead entering the final round at last week's FedEx St. Jude Classic before finishing one stroke out of a playoff, which was ultimately won by Justin Rose.\nBen Griffin has a start to forget\nAmerican Ben Griffin has enjoyed a season to remember on the PGA Tour. He's recorded his first two Tour wins and finished in the top 10 in seven other tournaments. He began the final round at the BMW Championship at 2-under par, tied for 16th place.\nHowever, his start on Sunday was nothing short of a disaster. Sitting in the right rough, 27 feet from the hole on the par-4 No. 1, he chipped to within four feet for par. However, he missed that putt, then missed the comebacker for bogey, had his remaining 3-footer roll all the way around the hole and finally tapped in for a 7.\nStill reeling from the triple bogey, Griffin hit his tee shot on the par-4 second hole way out of bounds. After reteeing, he found the rough, missed the green and couldn't convert a 15-footer for bogey.\nThen on the par-3 third, he found the rough of the tee and had to settle for a bogey to conclude the first three holes in six over par.\nOn the bright side, Griffin's body of work this season (7th in FedEx Cup points entering the BMW) has him in good enough shape that he'll still make the top 30 and advance to the Tour Championship.\nSunday tee times\nAll time Eastern\n- 9:05 a.m.: Andrew Novak\n- 9:12 a.m.: Sungjae Im, Jhonattan Vegas\n- 9:23 a.m.: Brian Campbell, Ryan Fox\n- 9:34 a.m.: Thomas Detry, Ryan Gerard\n- 9:45 a.m.: Chris Gotterup, Sam Stevens\n- 9:56 a.m.: Xander Schauffele, Bud Cauley\n- 10:07 a.m.: Denny McCarthy, Lucas Glover\n- 10:23 a.m.: Shane Lowry, Tom Hoge\n- 10:34 a.m.: Si Woo Kim, J.T.
