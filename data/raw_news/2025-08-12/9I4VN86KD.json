  "description": "Mark your calendar so you can catch Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus in the sky at the same time.",
  "content": "Fresh off the excitement of the Perseids meteor shower is a chance to see six planets lined up in the sky at once. These events, colloquially known as planet parades, only occur about once or twice a year, with the most recent one in February showing off all seven planets in our solar system at once. The next one will feature six of our closest celestial neighbors, and the event starts on Aug. 20.\n\nThe six planets sharing the sky will be Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus. Mars will technically be there at the beginning of the night, but it dips below the horizon right after sunset, so it won't be visible when all of the others are. Of those, Mercury, Venus and Jupiter will be visible to the naked eye, while the others will require high-powered binoculars or, preferably, a telescope.\n\nEven though they're spread out across the eastern and southern skies, the planets pair up with this one, making many of them pretty easy to find if you know what to look for. From east to west, here's where each one will be.\n\u2022 Mercury - Eastern sky near the Cancer constellation. It'll pop over the horizon just before sunrise, so you'll have limited time to view it before the sun comes up and obfuscates it.\n\u2022 Venus - At the lower tip of the Gemini constellation in the eastern sky, a couple of hours before sunrise.\n\u2022 Jupiter - Will be near Venus, also in the Gemini constellation. It rises about an hour before Venus does.\n\u2022 Uranus - Will be near the upper tip of Taurus, rising after midnight. This one will require some magnification. If you see Pleiades, a cluster of stars at the upper tip of Taurus, you've gone too far upward.\n\u2022 Saturn and Neptune - These two are right next to each other and will be sitting between the Pisces and Cetus constellations in the southern skies. Neptune will be closer to Pisces while Saturn will be closer to Cetus.\n\nSince it takes a long time for planets to move through the night sky, Aug. 20 is the starting point, and it'll run through the rest of the month. Once September hits, Mercury will be too close to the sun, which will obscure it. From that point, there will be a five-planet parade for a while until Venus sinks below the horizon in early October. So, in all, you'll have a chance to see at least five planets for over a month.\n\nWill the planet parade be visible from my region?\n\nYes. We double checked Stellarium's sky map from a variety of locations across the country, and everything above will be applicable everywhere in the continental US. Per Starwalk, the parade will also be visible in other parts of the world after the following dates for about the same amount of time (one to two weeks).\n\nThe planets will move based on date, though. The above locations are where they'll be around Aug. 20, but if you're looking a week or so later, they'll be in the same general area, but will shift to a slightly different part of the sky.\n\nWill I need any special equipment?\n\nYes. Neptune and Uranus, especially, will require some sort of magnification to see. We recommend a telescope, but high-powered binoculars may work if the sky is dark enough. Saturn is also difficult to see without magnification, so you'll want it for that too. Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury should be visible on their own with the naked eye.\n\nWe also recommend taking a trip out to the country, as light pollution from suburbs and cities can make it even more difficult to see Neptune and Uranus. The moon will be out as well, which may make Venus, Jupiter, and Mercury harder to see. Other factors like weather may also make it more difficult to see all of them. If you're lucky, you may see a few shooting stars at the tail end of Perseids as well.",

      "text": "Planetary Alignments Explained: Don\u2019t Miss the 6-Planet Parade on August 10, 2025\n6 planets will align on August 10 with 4 of them easily visible to the naked eye! Curious if you can see this event? It\u2019s easy to find out! Use the Planet Walk feature in the free Star Walk 2 app to see how the planets will line up from your location on the given date. This article provides a complete guide to observing the alignment and explains the science behind this amazing celestial event.\nContents\n- Six planets alignment on August 10, 2025\n- What is a planetary alignment?\n- What happens when the planets align?\n- The upcoming planetary alignments\n- FAQ\n- Planet Alignment 2025: Conclusion\nPlanetary alignment is an astronomical term that means that several planets gather closely on one side of the Sun at the same time.\nPlanet parade is a colloquial term that means, in the broadest sense, that several planets are present in the sky in one night.\nNow, let's find out when the planets will align next. To learn more about how planetary alignments work, go straight to the \"What is a planetary alignment\" chapter.\nSix planets alignment on August 10, 2025\nLook for a large planetary alignment around August 10, 2025! In the morning, about an hour before sunrise, six planets \u2014 Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Uranus, Neptune, and Saturn \u2014 will align in the sky.\nFour of them (Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn) will be easily visible to the naked eye. For Uranus and Neptune, get a pair of binoculars or a small telescope.\nDon\u2019t miss this rare chance to see six planets in the sky at once! The next opportunity won\u2019t come until late February 2026. Plus, warm summer mornings in the Northern Hemisphere are ideal for planet watching. And there\u2019s more \u2014 the Perseid meteor shower, one of the most famous of the year, will peak around the same time. So, while watching the planets, keep an eye out for a few \u201cshooting stars\u201d too!\nHere are some details about each planet:\nElusive Mercury (mag 1.9) will be halfway to its greatest separation from the Sun in the sky. It will rise last and stay closest to the Sun, visible low above the eastern horizon shortly before sunrise in the constellation Cancer.\nHigher in the sky, you'll find Jupiter (mag -1.9), the second brightest planet, in Gemini.\nNearby, in the same constellation, spot brilliant Venus (mag -3.9). On August 12, Venus and Jupiter will make their closest approach of the year \u2014 just 0\u00b052\u2032 apart, close enough to cover both with your little finger at arm\u2019s length.\nLook even higher to find Uranus (mag 5.7) in Taurus. While it\u2019s theoretically visible to the naked eye under perfect dark-sky conditions, binoculars will make it much easier to spot.\nTo the west of Uranus, search for faint Neptune (mag 7.8) in Pisces. You\u2019ll need at least a pair of powerful binoculars to see it.\nClose to Neptune, also in Pisces, is golden Saturn (mag 0.7). Its steady, yellowish glow sets it apart from the stars. But if you're unsure whether you're looking at a star or a planet, open the free Star Walk 2 app \u2014 just point your device at the sky, tap the camera icon to enter AR mode, and see an interactive sky map tailored to your location.\nAnd there's more: below Saturn, closer to the horizon, you\u2019ll see the nearly Full Moon in Aquarius. To the naked eye, it will appear fully illuminated and may even look larger than usual.\nThe downside? Its brightness will outshine Neptune. The upside? You probably weren\u2019t going to catch that dim planet anyway \u2014 and the Full Moon makes for a far more stunning view!\nWhere & when to see planetary alignment today?\nThe large planetary alignment will be visible in the mornings around August 10, 2025: start looking about an hour before sunrise. Some locations will have better viewing conditions as the planets rise higher above the horizon. Mercury will be favoring southern latitudes.\nNote that August 10, 2025 is a median date based on when this event will be well visible for most locations around the world. The perfect date to view the alignment may vary depending on your location.\nBelow are the selected locations and dates when the planets will be visible in the smallest sector of the sky during this alignment, along with the altitude of the lowest planet, Mercury, during the nautical twilight.\n- Abu Dhabi: August 9, 161-degree sky sector, altitude 6\u00b0;\n- Athens: August 10, 146-degree sky sector, altitude 5\u00b0';\n- Beijing: August 10, 144-degree sky sector, altitude 4\u00b0;\n- Berlin: August 10, 135-degree sky sector, altitude 2\u00b0;\n- London: August 10, 136-degree sky sector, altitude 2\u00b0;\n- New York: August 10, 144-degree sky sector, altitude 4\u00b0;\n- Tokyo: August 10, 148-degree sky sector, altitude 5\u00b0;\n- Bombay: August 11, 170-degree sky sector, altitude 7\u00b0;\n- Hong Kong: August 11, 164-degree sky sector, altitude 7\u00b0;\n- Mexico: August 11, 169-degree sky sector, altitude 7\u00b0;\n- Reykjav\u00edk: August 12, 129-degree sky sector, altitude 1\u00b0 (during civil twilight);\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: August 12, 141-degree sky sector, altitude 4\u00b0;\n- Sydney: August 12, 134-degree sky sector, altitude 5\u00b0;\nNote that tall buildings or high mountains near you might hide the planets from view.\nHow to see a planetary alignment in August?\nCatching six planets in the sky at once requires precise timing. Mercury will rise shortly before sunrise, so the observation window is short.\nThe easiest way to find all the planets in the sky is to use the Planet Walk feature in the free Star Walk 2 app \u2014 a new tool designed for tracking planets and alignments. During the February planetary alignment, thousands of users already approved it!\n-\nOpen Star Walk 2 and go to the Planets section from the Menu.\n-\nTap \"Planet Walk\".\n- You'll see a sky map with planets highlighted.\n- Planet icons (along with the Sun and Moon) appear at the bottom \u2014 tap one to find it on the map.\n- If a planet is below the horizon, its icon will look faded.\n-\nPoint your device at the sky to match the image on your screen with the real sky.\n-\nTap a planet\u2019s icon and follow the white arrow to spot it in the sky.\n- For an even more immersive view, tap the camera icon (top right corner) to activate AR mode and see a sky map overlaid on your real surroundings.\nNo other astronomy app offers a feature quite like Planet Walk , which waited years before being introduced. Read the behind-the-scenes story and see how it can enhance your stargazing adventures.\nTo see the alignment in all its beauty, find a place with a dark sky without light pollution and with a clear view of the horizon (without obstacles such as trees or tall buildings).\nAlso, make sure you\u2019re looking at planets, not stars. They may all appear as shining dots in the sky, but with a few tips, you can easily distinguish planets from other celestial objects. First of all, the planets Venus and Jupiter are often the brightest dots in the sky. In addition, unlike stars, planets shine with a steady light and hardly twinkle. For more tips on viewing planets, check out our handy guide.\nTo learn when planets are best visible in your location and plan the observations ahead, check the \"Best nights\" section in the Star Walk 2 app. It will show you when the planets gather in the smallest section of the sky.\nWhat is a planetary alignment?\nHere are two common definitions of a planetary alignment:\n- An astronomical event when planets gather closely on one side of the Sun at the same time, as seen from above the Solar System.\nSome people think the Solar System planets can form a straight line as viewed from the Sun. However, the planets cannot achieve full alignment in three dimensions. Even a looser grouping in one quadrant (a 90-degree sector) is extremely rare: all planets gather in one quadrant only 7 times in the current millennium.\n- A visual phenomenon when the planets appear close together in a small sky sector, as seen from the Earth.\nWhen the Earth is one of the planets gathered on one side of the Sun, it appears to the observer that several planets are aligned in the sky. The smaller the sector in which the planets are seen, the more spectacular the alignment.\nDon\u2019t forget that alignments from the first definition aren\u2019t always as striking as seen from the Earth. Even when all the planets gather within one quadrant in space, they may be scattered across the sky\u2019s dome. Moreover, when the inner planets are close to the Earth-Sun line, we won't see them in the night sky.\nLook at our infographic to understand how planetary alignments work. You\u2019ll learn how to spot them and what to expect from the upcoming \"planet parade.\"\nDo the planets form a line in the sky during the planetary alignment?\nThe planets do form a line, but it's not perfectly straight. All the planets orbit the Sun in almost the same plane. As a result, when viewing from Earth, the other planets appear to move along the ecliptic, the Sun\u2019s yearly path across the sky.\nYou can see it yourself with the stargazing app Star Walk 2:\n-\nOpen the app and go to the \"Planets\" section in the Menu.\n-\nPlay the animation in the section. Do you see the yellow dotted line forming an arc? This is the ecliptic. The planets are grouped near this line.\n-\nTap the Planet Walk button to see the planets on the sky map.\n- In the animation, the ecliptic appears as an arc because it shows a wide view of the sky, from east to west.\n- On the sky map, where only a smaller section of the sky is visible, the ecliptic appears as a straight line.\nThis is why, during a planetary alignment, the planets seem to form an almost straight line in the sky.\nIs a planetary alignment and a planet parade the same thing?\n\"Planet parade\" is not an official astronomical term, so it is used more loosely than the term \"planetary alignment.\" Planetary alignments are colloquially called planet parades. Additionally, when multiple planets are visible together in one night, it can also be called a planet parade. In astrology, a planet parade occurs when several planets are located in the same zodiac constellation.\nTypes of planetary alignments in the Solar System\nThe following types of planetary alignments are distinguished according to the number of participating planets:\n- Mini planetary alignment \u2013 3 planets.\n- Small planetary alignment \u2013 4 planets.\n- Large planetary alignment \u2013 5 or 6 planets.\n- Great (full) planetary alignment \u2013 all Solar System planets (+ Pluto sometimes).\nWhen two planets are close in the sky, what is it called?\nWhen two planets meet in the sky, it's not a planetary alignment yet. It may be the closest approach or conjunction. In our dedicated article, you\u2019ll find details about the upcoming planetary conjunctions. Often, a conjunction occurs between two planets during a planetary alignment. During the August alignment, the two brightest planets, Venus and Jupiter, will make a close approach. They will be at their closest on the morning of August 12. Look toward the eastern horizon before sunrise.\nWhat happens when the planets align?\nSome people, especially on social media, falsely claim that alignments can cause tsunamis, earthquakes, and other global disasters due to the gravitational forces of other planets. This nonsense has been repeatedly debunked. In reality, alignments do not affect gravity or human life, but they are cool astronomical events.\nSuch speculations are based on the fact that not everyone understands how planetary alignments work. When planets align in the sky from the Earth\u2019s point of view, it doesn\u2019t mean they form a straight line in space. On this chart, you can see how planets will actually be positioned in the Solar System during a large planetary alignment on August 10, 2025.\nEven when several planets do line up roughly on one side of the Sun (if we look from above the Solar System\u2019s plane), this rare event \u2014 called a syzygy \u2014 is completely harmless. It has happened many times throughout history without causing trouble.\nOnly two objects in our Solar System have a noticeable effect on Earth's gravity: the Moon and the Sun. Twice each month, when the Earth, Moon, and Sun line up during new or full Moon phases, their combined gravity creates exceptionally high tides.\nSome people mistakenly think that if a line-up of only three objects causes higher tides, then the alignment of all planets means a tremendous gravitational impact on Earth. However, it is not the number of objects that matters, but their proximity and mass. The Moon\u2019s gravity affects Earth because it\u2019s very close, and the Sun affects us because it\u2019s extremely massive (about 1,000 times bigger than the largest planet, Jupiter). Meanwhile, planets in our system are too far apart to strongly affect each other with gravity.\nSpiritual meaning of planetary alignments\nSome people believe that planets can influence their lives. For instance, Mercury impacts communication and thinking, Venus \u2014 relationships and love, and Uranus represents change, innovations, and rebellion.\nAlignments of several planets are often described as events that \"enhance the flow of cosmic energy on Earth\" and \"offer a unique opportunity to tap into the energy of the cosmos, empowering personal growth and transformations\".\nHowever, there is no scientific proof that planetary alignments influence our bodies, behavior, or destiny. If you feel energized or inspired to take up a new hobby, that's great \u2014 just remember that it's not controlled by the planets.\nThe upcoming planetary alignments\nPlan your planetary observations for the next few years and beyond! And don\u2019t miss the next planetary alignment \u2013 described in detail at the beginning of the article and regularly updated.\nNot all parts of the world have the same view of planetary alignments. Due to the position of the ecliptic on the celestial sphere, certain planets may not be visible from where you live. Therefore, please keep in mind that the following list of planetary alignments is a general overview. The listed dates indicate when the planets can be clearly seen from most locations worldwide. If you miss this precise date, don't worry \u2014 the alignment is typically visible for a few days before and after the given date.\nHere are the upcoming planetary alignments that will occur in 2025-2026:\n- August 10: a large morning alignment of Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Uranus, Neptune, and Saturn.\n- February 28, 2026: a large evening alignment of Mercury, Venus, Neptune, Saturn, Uranus, and Jupiter.\n- April 18, 2026: a small morning alignment of Saturn, Mars, Mercury, and Neptune.\n- May 12, 2026: a mini evening alignment of Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus.\n- August 12, 2026: a large morning alignment of Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, Uranus, Saturn, and Neptune.\n- November 14, 2026: a small morning alignment of Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter.\nTo check if a specific planetary alignment is entirely visible from your location, use the Star Walk 2 app. Open the \"Planets\" section in the Menu and tap \"\u2606 Best nights to see planets\". You\u2019ll find a list of date ranges when several planets align in your sky. The date in the middle marks when planets align in the smallest sector of the sky in your location. Tap any alignment to jump to that date.\nYou'll see key details like planets\u2019 rise and set times, brightness, and night duration (when the Sun is below the horizon).\nUse the animated scheme to watch how the planets move across the sky on that date and pick the best time for viewing.\nWhen will 5, 6, or 7 planets align in the sky?\nHere is the list of the next planetary alignments that feature 5 to 7 planets:\n- August 10, 2025: a large morning alignment of Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, and Saturn.\n- February 28, 2026: a large evening alignment of Mercury, Venus, Neptune, Saturn, Uranus, and Jupiter.\n- August 12, 2026: a large morning alignment of Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, Uranus, Saturn, and Neptune.\n- July 2, 2027: a large morning alignment of Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\nThe most anticipated planetary alignments\nHere are some planetary alignments discussed in the media. They are noteworthy because they feature many planets that are grouped closely together. However, most of them won\u2019t happen anytime soon, so don't hold your breath.\nOn September 8, 2040, five naked-eye planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) will align in the sky. The crescent Moon will also be visible, positioned between Venus and Saturn. The best time for observations will be around 19:30 local time.\nOn March 15, 2080, six planets \u2013 Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, and Uranus \u2013 will be visible in the morning sky. This alignment is especially remarkable because it will feature the \"great conjunction\" of Saturn and Jupiter, which will be only six arcminutes apart.\nOn May 19, 2161, all Solar System planets, including the Earth, will gather on one side of the Sun. The planetary alignment will be seen just before dawn.\nOn November 7, 2176, all Solar System planets, including the Earth, will gather on one side of the Sun. The planetary alignment will be seen in the Earth\u2019s sky just after sunset.\nOn May 6, 2492, all Solar System planets, including the Earth, will gather on one side of the Sun. In the Earth\u2019s sky, the planetary alignment will be seen just after sunset.\nFAQ\nWhen is the next planetary alignment?\nThe next planet parade is around August 10, 2025, when six planets \u2013 Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Uranus, Neptune, and Saturn \u2013 will align in the sky. The next alignment after that will take place on February 28, 2026, and will feature the same six planets \u2014 Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, and Saturn. Learn about planetary alignments and how to observe them with our colorful infographic.\nWhat is it called when all the planets align?\nWhen all Solar System planets align, it\u2019s called a \"great\" or \"full\" planetary alignment. However, the planets can\u2019t be in a straight line in space, so during the alignment, they just gather closely on one side of the Sun.\nHow to see the next alignment of planets?\nPlanetary alignments are quite easy to observe, with just a few essential tips to keep in mind:\n- The alignments featuring Mercury can be viewed just after sunset or before dawn, depending on the date.\n- Use a pair of binoculars when trying to spot Uranus and Neptune.\n- For the inner planets, the best viewing conditions occur near their greatest elongations, and for the outer planets \u2013 around their oppositions.\nUse the app Star Walk 2 to find all the planets in the sky above you and learn their visibility conditions.\nWhen will all the planets align?\nThe planets of our Solar System never form a perfectly straight line in space, because their orbits aren't on the same plane. But sometimes, the planets gather closely on one side of the Sun and appear together in the sky. At the next great (full) planetary alignment on February 3, 2034, the seven planets \u2014 Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, Mars, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn \u2014 will be observable in the sky simultaneously.\nPlanet Alignment 2025: Conclusion\nPlanetary alignment is a term used in astronomy to describe the event when several planets gather in a small sky area. This event may also be colloquially called a \"planetary parade.\" The next time you will be able to see a planetary alignment is around August 10, 2025. Six planets \u2014 Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Uranus, Neptune, and Saturn \u2014 will align in the morning sky, about an hour before sunrise, and the nearly full Moon will join them. A couple of bright Perseid meteors might also light up the sky! Download the free stargazing app Star Walk 2 to spot all the planets easily.\nStill got questions?

      "text": "Skygazers rejoice, the summer isn't finished with delivering dazzling meteor showers. The last week of July saw dueling meteor showers taking over the sky, but the most popular meteor shower of the year won't hit its peak until next week. The Perseids meteor shower is about to give you a real light show, provided you're far enough away from light pollution to see it.\nPerseids are known for their bright fireballs and plentiful meteors. The show started on July 17, and will run through Aug. 23.\nThe reason the Perseids meteor shower is so popular is twofold. First, it takes place in the summer, so going outside and watching it is less uncomfortable than other large meteor showers like Quadrantids, which takes place in wintery January.\nThe other reason is that it's one of the most active meteor showers of the year. During its peak, the meteor shower is known to rain down as many as 100 meteors per hour, according to the American Meteor Society. These not only include your typical shooting stars, but also a higher chance for fireballs, which are meteors that explode as they enter orbit. Per NASA, fireballs tend to last longer than standard shooting stars and can come in a variety of different colors.\nPerseids come to Earth courtesy of the 109P/Swift-Tuttle comet. Earth's orbit around the sun brings it through Swift-Tuttle's tail every year. The comet itself takes 133 years to orbit the sun. Its last perihelion -- the point at which it's the closest to the sun -- was in 1992. It won't be back until the year 2125. Until then, it leaves behind an excellent tail of dust and debris to feed us yearly meteor showers.\nHow to catch the Perseids meteor shower\nThe best time to view the Perseids is during its peak, which occurs on the evenings of Aug. 12 and 13. During this time, the shower will produce anywhere from 25 to 100 meteors per hour on average. However, since the shower officially lasts for over a month, you have a chance to see a shooting star on any given evening, provided that you're far enough away from light pollution.\nThus, if you're planning on watching this year's Perseids during their peak, you'll want to get out of the city and suburbs as far as possible. According to Bill Cooke, lead of NASA's Meteoroid Environments Office, folks in the city might see one or two meteors from the meteor shower per hour, which is pocket change compared to what those outside city limits might see.\nRegardless, once you've arrived at wherever you want to watch the meteors, you'll want to direct your attention to the radiant, or the point at which the meteors will appear to originate. Like all meteors, Perseids are named after the constellation from which they appear. In this case, it's Perseus.\nPer Stellarium's free sky map, Perseus will rise from the northeastern horizon across the continental US on the evenings of Aug. 12 and 13. It'll then rise into the eastern sky, where it'll remain until after sunrise. So, in short, point yourself due east and you should be OK. Binoculars may help, but we recommend against telescopes since they'll restrict your view of the sky to a very small portion, which may hinder your meteor-sighting efforts.\nThe American Meteor Society also notes that the moon may give viewers some difficulty. Perseids' peak occurs just three days after August's full moon, so the moon will still be mostly full. Thus, it is highly probable that light pollution from the moon may reduce the number of visible meteors by a hefty margin, depending on how things go."

      "text": "If you've got any interest in skygazing, this is your week. A stunning planet parade is now visible in the night sky. A planet parade is when several of our solar system's planets are visible in the night sky at the same time. All seven planets will be visible this time around, meaning Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Neptune and Uranus. (Earth, of course, is the eighth planet, and poor Pluto was demoted in 2006 and is now considered a dwarf planet.)\nMars, Venus, Jupiter, Mercury and Saturn should be visible to the naked eye. You'll need a high-powered viewing device like a telescope to spot Neptune and Uranus.\nThe best time to view the planets from the Northern Hemisphere will be just after sunset at around 8:30 p.m. local time. You still might be able to catch Venus, Mercury, Saturn and Neptune on the horizon after that, but those planets will be under the horizon by 11:30 p.m. to midnight depending on your location. After that, Mars, Jupiter and Uranus will remain visible for a few more hours with Mars finally setting just before sunrise.\nBy the time March gets underway, Mercury, Saturn and Neptune will have drifted too close to the sun to be readily visible with Venus not far behind, leaving Jupiter, Mars and Uranus to populate the night sky until the next parade begins.\nWill my region see the planet parade?\nMost, if not all, locations in the US, Canada and Mexico should be able to see the planetary parade this time around thanks to its long length and limited planetary movement. We checked observatories in California, Texas, Ohio and New York in the US, along with Calgary in Canada and Mexico City, Mexico, and were able to find all six planets at each location, so it doesn't matter how far north, east, west or south you go, you'll be able to see it.\nRead more: Full Moons Explained, From Blue Moons to Supermoons to Lunar Phases\nThey'll be there as soon as the sun sets. Once it's dark, you'll only have a couple of hours to view them before Venus, Saturn and Neptune dip below the horizon for the evening. This applies regardless of location, so no matter where you are, everything's happening at around the same time.\nDuring these last few days of February, Mercury is making its appearance and the parade has increased to seven planets. This will be best viewed right at sunset and will be more difficult to see while the sun is still on the horizon.\nWill I need any special equipment to view the parade?\nTechnically yes. You'll be able to spot Venus, Mars, Jupiter and potentially Saturn with the naked eye in opportune conditions. However, Neptune and Uranus are simply too far away to spot. Astronomers note that you'll likely need a telescope with at least an 8-inch aperture at 50 times magnification to see Uranus and its rings, and 150 times magnification to see Neptune and its rings. If you're so equipped, give that telescope a point at Saturn. At 25 times magnification, you'll be able to see the crown jewel of our solar system in all its glory.\nStandard space viewing rules also apply here. You'll want to get away from the city, where light pollution can obfuscate your view. Even the suburbs may not be far enough away for many folks. If you're planning a long drive out of the city and its surroundings, you'll want to make sure it's a clear night with as little cloud cover as possible.\nHow can I find the planets in the sky?\nGiven that Neptune and Uranus are particularly hard to find paired with the fact that Saturn and Venus will be right next to each other, there may be some difficulty in finding all six planets in the sky.\nFor this, there are a few good tools available. Check out Stellarium's website, along with Time and Date's Night Sky Map. Those should give you a good idea of where each planet is in relation to the others. Star Walk 2 is an excellent app on Android and iOS. Stellarium has its own Android and iOS apps as well.\nWhat is a planetary parade?\nA planetary parade is a colloquial term that applies when four or more planets line up in the night sky at once. It's not an official astronomy term so you'll rarely hear astronomers use it. However, NASA has been known to refer to the phenomenon as a \"parade of planets.\"\nThe official term is planetary alignment, although that term tends to seed a little bit of confusion. Some interpretations of the phrase include the planets lining up on the same side of the sun all right next to each other. The planets can never fully line up exactly like you see in pictures, but they can all be on the same side of the sun and relatively close to lining up.\nIn day-to-day use, though, planetary parades and alignments are the same thing and simply describe when there are several planets visible in the night sky at the same time. These planets may be nowhere near each other in their solar orbits but are visible from the perspective of Earth."

      "text": "Want to see a meteor shower next week? They come around every year like clockwork and that means planning shooting star trips can be done months in advance. Here's a look at the next one, plus what's coming for the rest of 2025.\nTips for watching\nTo have the best odds of seeing the most meteors during any given shower, the first advice is to get as far away from the big city as logistically possible -- and that also applies to suburbanites. Light pollution is the enemy of space viewing and most meteor showers are barely visible in the suburbs, let alone a big city. From there, you'll want to find the radiant -- also known as the point from which the meteor shower appears to originate -- and then keep your eyes pointed in that direction. The moon's light can also be a negative factor, but since meteor showers occur on specific days, it's up to nature as to whether or not moonlight will affect viewing.\nLyrids\nWhen: Apr. 15 to Apr. 30\nPeak date: Apr. 21 to 22\nMaximum meteor rate: 18 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Lyra\nThings pick up again in April with the Lyrids meteor shower. Its radiant is Lyra, which will rise out of the eastern sky every night during its run. This one is a little bigger than most, having up to 18 meteors per hour. Earth runs through the C/1861 G1 Thatcher comet every April to bring this shower to its citizens. Interestingly, meteors from Lyrids tend to not have trails but can produce some pretty bright fireballs.\nEta Aquariids\nWhen: Apr. 20 to May 21\nPeak date: May 3 to 4\nMaximum meteor rate: 50 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Aquarius\nThe 1P/Halley, famously known as Halley's Comet, is responsible for the Eta Aquariids, and it's the biggest meteor shower to occur during spring with up to 50 meteors per hour. The only downside is that its radiant, Aquarius, doesn't rise out of the southeastern sky until around 4 a.m. local time, meaning you'll have to wake up very early or stay up super late to catch it. On the plus side, the moon will have set by then, meaning the moon won't obstruct the view for this meteor shower.\nAlpha Capricornids\nWhen: July 12 to Aug. 12\nPeak date: July 29 to 30\nMaximum meteor rate: 5 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Capricornus\nAlpha Capricornids is a minor meteor shower that comes from the 169P/NEAT comet. It's not a strong shower, but it is notable for producing some rather large fireballs. It's also equally visible in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. The radiant for this one is Capricornus, which streaks through the south sky and will be visible all night during its peak. Fortunately, the moon won't be too full, so it won't obstruct the view too much.\nSouthern delta Aquariids\nWhen: July 28 to Aug. 12\nPeak date: July 29 to 30\nMaximum meteor rate: 25 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Aquarius\nSouthern delta Aquariids often overshadows the Alpha Capricornids. This meteor shower peaks early, just a day or two after it officially starts, and then tails off through mid-August. Its early peak puts it on the same day as Alpha Capricornids, so if you see a shooting star on July 29 or 30, it might have come from either one. The radiant for this one is Aquarius, which is right next to Capricornus, making the two showers a fine pairing. Researchers aren't 100% certain which comet gives us the Southern delta Aquariids, although the best guess right now is 96P/Machholz.\nPerseids\nWhen: July 17 to Aug. 23\nPeak date: Aug. 12 to 13\nMaximum meteor rate: 100 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Perseus\nPerseids is one of the premier space events that takes place during the summer. It comes from the 109P/Swift-Tuttle comet and is one of the most consistently busy meteor showers of the year. Plus, it takes place over the summer, which is perfect meteor shower weather. The radiant is Perseus, which rises out of the northeastern sky relatively early in the evening and stays up all night. The only downside is that the moon will be almost full during Perseids' peak in 2025, making it more difficult to see the smaller meteors.\nSouthern Taurids\nWhen: Sept. 23 to Nov. 4\nPeak date: Oct. 10 to 11\nMaximum meteor rate: 5 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Taurus\nSouthern Taurids is one of the longest-lasting meteor showers of the year lasting well over a month. It's not a particularly active meteor shower, but since it takes place during several other meteor showers, you may spot one of these while looking for another one. The 2P/Encke comet fuels this one and it peaks a couple of weeks away from Halloween. This one is paired with the Northern Taurids to make the Taurids meteor shower. However, they peak on different days so they're often listed as separate meteor showers.\nOrionids\nWhen: Oct. 2 to Nov. 12\nPeak date: Oct. 22 to 23\nMaximum meteor rate: 20 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Orion\nOrionids is a reasonably active meteor shower that happens mostly during October. It also has the distinction of coming from the famous Halley's Comet just like the Eta Aquariids shower. Unlike Eta Aquariids, the Orionids come out of the Orion constellation, which rises out of the eastern sky in October. Also, the moon will be virtually new, so it'll have one of the darkest skies of any meteor shower this year.\nDraconids\nWhen: Oct. 6 to Oct. 10\nPeak date: Oct. 8\nMaximum meteor rate: 10 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Draco\nDraconids is a minor meteor shower and the shortest one on the list, lasting for all of four days. It hails from the 21/P Giacobini-Zimmer comet and has a fairly decent peak at around 10 meteors per hour. The peak occurs just two days after it starts and then the meteor shower ends two days later. The radiant for Draconids is Draco, which is between the Big Dipper and Little Dipper, making it relatively easy to find in the night sky.\nNorthern Taurids\nWhen: Oct. 13 to Dec. 1\nPeak date: Nov. 8 to 9\nMaximum meteor rate: 5 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Taurus\nNorthern Taurids is the other half of the Taurids meteor shower and this one lasts even longer, going from the middle of October all the way until December. It peaks about halfway through its run on Nov. 8, which is a few weeks later than its southern counterpart. Otherwise, the two are virtually identical. They are both fueled by the 2P/Encke comet and at their best produce around five meteors per hour. For now, researchers believe that this shower comes from a different segment of the Encke comet trail, which is why it's often listed separately from its southern cousin.\nLeonids\nWhen: Nov. 3 to Dec. 2\nPeak date: Nov. 16 to 17\nMaximum meteor rate: 15 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Leo\nJust a few days after the Northern Taurids peaks, the Leonids shower will also peak. Created by the 55P/Tempel-Tuttle comet, Leonids will come from the Leo constellation, which rises in the eastern sky right around 2 a.m. local time for most of its run. This is a bigger meteor shower than the Taurids but a smaller shower than the Orionids. Since all four of them intersect during the first week of November, it may be tough to tell which meteor shower a shooting star comes from. This is especially true since Taurus, Leo, and Orion are all in the eastern sky at this time of year. Leonids often has fast, bright meteors that leave a trail, which may be the only way to differentiate a Leonids meteor from the other three showers.\nGeminids\nWhen: Dec. 4 to Dec. 20\nPeak date: Dec. 14 to 15\nMaximum meteor rate: 120 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Gemini\nGeminids is one of the biggest meteor showers of the year, and it peaks less than two weeks away from Christmas. It's generated by the 3200 Phaethon comet and can show as many as 120 meteors per hour in the right conditions. Geminids is best known for its brighter, slower-moving meteors, making them easier to see in brighter areas like cities or suburbs. It takes place during the cold season, but it can put on quite a show if viewed from outside the big city.\nUrsids\nWhen: Dec. 17 to Dec. 26\nPeak date: Dec. 22 to 23\nMaximum meteor rate: 10 meteors per hour\nRadiant: The Little Dipper\nUrsids begins right after the peak of Geminids and continues until the day after Christmas. Since Geminids ends before Christmas, it is statistically likely that if you've ever watched a Christmas movie that has a shooting star, it likely came from Ursids. The shower peaks on the evening of Dec. 22 from the Little Dipper, which is readily visible in the night sky for most of the evening. Much like Draconids, it disappears almost as fast as it shows up, lasting only nine days in total.\nQuadrantids\nWhen:: Dec. 12, 2025 to Jan. 12, 2026\nPeak date: Jan. 3 to 4, 2026\nMaximum meteor rate: 120 meteors per hour\nRadiant: The Big Dipper\nThe year ends the same way it begins with the Quandrantids meteor shower. It starts in early December and wraps around to the New Year. Thus, while it does have the distinction of being the only meteor shower that occurs twice a year, the peak is always in the first few days of January. Otherwise, it's the same meteor shower as the Quadrantids listed above. So, we'll use this space to deliver a fun fact. Most meteor showers are fueled by comets, chunks of ice floating through the universe that leave long trails that, as Earth moves through them, create meteors. However, Quadrantids is fueled by 2003 EH, which is an asteroid and not a comet. Researchers believe that 2003 EH is potentially a comet that died out and became an asteroid."
