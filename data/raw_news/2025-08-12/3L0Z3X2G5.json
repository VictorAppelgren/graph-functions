  "content": "Plus, TripAdvisor's best 25 beaches across Europe\n\nLET'S SEA 10 of the strangest creatures found on UK beaches this summer \u2013 from glowing worms to baked bean blobs\n\nROCKPOOLS and the shallow waters of Britain's beaches are home to some of the most unusual creatures you've probably never heard of.\n\nIf you know what to look for, you can discover these bizarre little critters yourself.\n\nWin one of 8 incredible holidays to the Caribbean, Mexico and Greece by voting in The Sun's Travel Awards - enter to win here\n\nFrom spiky, potato-like beings to sea worms that look more like a sweet, there is a whole world marine life to investigate along the UK's coastlines, according to seaside experts at Simply Sea View.\n\nFirst up is the Sea Mouse - a small creature, that some find cute and others find fascinating.\n\nThis little creature isn't a mouse as we know it, it is a type of worm, which often gets washed up on beaches after a storm.\n\nYou might be able to spot it by its glistening bristles or iridescent colouring.\n\nEssentially, it is known to look a bit like a LED-lit hedgehog.\n\nIf you want to find a Sea Mouse, you should head to beaches in East Wales or Cornwall.\n\nAfter the sea washes out and leaves rockpools full of water and creatures, you might be able to spot a Tompot Blenny.\n\nThese squidgy-looking fish have big bulging eyes, think lips and even frilly horn-like features on their heads.\n\nTypically, they are orange or brown in colour, with different patterns all over.\n\nThe alien-like fish often hides in crevices and corners of rockpools, so you may want to sit still for a while with a sandwich and drink to catch a glimpse of the creature.\n\nThe good news is that they can be found on rocky shorelines across the entire country.\n\nThe thought of candy and flatworms don't really go together, but the Candy Striped Flatworm looks a bit like a mint humbug.\n\nTypically, they are cream in colour and have a darker central stripe, and then fainter stipes running parallel.\n\nEssentially, they look like a fancy slug - but are a great creature to find.\n\nYou will find them along UK coastlines in rocky and muddy areas at low tides.\n\nGetting its name from the long green vegetable, Brown Sea Cucumbers look the same, just a different colour.\n\nThey are yellow and brown blobs, but do have frilly tentacles that appear when they are eating.\n\nIt is best to avoid touching them as many sea cucumbers produce a toxin called holothurin, which can be irritating or even harmful to humans.\n\nThey can be found along many coastal areas of the UK, including Cornwall in particular.\n\nNamed after gooseberries due to their size and shape, these small spherical clear balls are actually small invertebrates.\n\nEven though they resemble jellyfish, they are a different species.\n\nNormally, they only measure up to 2.5cm and have eight rows of hair-like features.\n\nAmazingly, they also have two long tentacles that can measure up to 50cm.\n\nSome species even have a luminescence, occasionally lighting up the waves at night.\n\nThey are often seen in UK waters during the summer months and occasionally wash up on the beach.\n\nThis is another creature that looks like its name.\n\nSea Potatoes are cream-coloured but are covered in fur-like spines.\n\nThey usually reach between 6cm and 9cm in size and are a type of sea urchin.\n\nSea Potatoes can be found around the UK buried in sandy and muddy seabeds.\n\nHowever, you are more likely to see them washed up on the beach as an empty shell, without the spines.\n\nIt isn't hard to picture what Baked Bean Sea Squirt looks like thanks to its name...\n\nBut these odd orange blobs that look like a splattering of baked beans under the water can often be found glued to a rock.\n\nThey are actually a type of sea squirt that filters seawater.\n\nThe odd sight can often be found along the Scottish coasts, such as Loch Fyne and some southern coasts.\n\nImagine two halves of a shell still attached, with fuzzy orange fur like Oscar the Grouch from the TV show Sesame Street and that is pretty much a Flame Shell Reef.\n\nThese little creature are among the UK's most colourful and are a small orange mollusc that builds nests using its fire-coloured tentacles.\n\nOther sea creatures will often hide under Flame Shell Reefs too.\n\nThey can be found in Loch Carron and Loch Alsh, both in Scotland.\n\nFor kids who love stingrays, looking for an Undulate Ray might be the perfect task.\n\nThese rays feature elaborate patterns on their backs, with dark lines, spots and splodges.\n\nThis helps them to camouflage into the sand.\n\nAnd they are generally completely harmless to humans.\n\nYou most likely won't be able to find these guys unless you are swimming or snorkelling in UK waters.\n\nMany people might walk straight past a By-the-Wind Sailor mistaking it for some washed up piece of plastic.\n\nBut actually, these clear jellyfish with a sail will float on the shore and often wash up in large numbers on our coasts.\n\nThey get their name from drift on the surface of the ocean but then get washed up during storms.\n\nIt is coming up to the ideal time to spot them as well, as they are usually spotted on UK beaches between September and March.\n\nIf you enjoy rock-pooling, the UK is also home to a stunning park with its own beach that visitors say is like \u2018being in another world\u2019.\n\nPlus, you can find incredible lava sea pools that are just four hours from the UK.",
