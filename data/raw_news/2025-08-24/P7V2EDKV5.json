  "title": "Lewis Hamilton's old boss makes feelings clear on sacked rival Christian Horner",
  "description": "MERCEDES chief Toto Wolff has opened up about his love-hate relationship with former Red Bull boss Christian Horner. Horner was dismissed by Red Bull last month, putting an end to his 20-year stint\u2026",
  "content": "Wolff also had his say on the controversial 2021 title race\n\nCHRIS CROSS \u2018He\u2019s been acting like an a**hole\u2019 \u2013 Lewis Hamilton\u2019s old boss makes feelings clear on sacked F1 rival Christian Horner\n\nMERCEDES chief Toto Wolff has opened up about his love-hate relationship with former Red Bull boss Christian Horner.\n\nHorner was dismissed by Red Bull last month, putting an end to his 20-year stint with the Formula One team.\n\nOver the last decade, the Brit and Mercedes team principal Wolff had developed a rivalry off the track which eventually translated to the grid through their drivers.\n\nWolff has now revealed his thoughts on Horner's exit and what it could mean for the sport.\n\nHe told Formula.hu earlier this month: \"What do I think? Well, he's been acting like an a**hole quite often in the last 12-15 years.\n\n\"He operates on completely different values, but even your worst enemy has a best friend.\n\n\"On the other hand, he was hugely successful at what he did. Now that he's gone, at least for a while, a real personality has left the sport.\n\n\"He was controversial and divisive, but he was one of the main characters here.\n\n\"You could safely say he was as significant as a great driver. If I look at it purely from an F1 perspective, I don't think there are many old-style team boss dinosaurs left here.\n\n\"Maybe just me. Maybe Fred (Vasseur) is a bit of a dinosaur too.\"\n\nAsked about the nailbiting title race between then-Mercedes man Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull superstar Max Verstappen in 2021, which resulted in the Dutchman winning his first F1 crown in controversial circumstances, Wolff added: \"If you look at it, it was always an interesting story.\n\n\"Those years, but especially 2021, it wasn\u2019t just about Max and Lewis, it was about Christian and me. And sometimes it was really hard, it\u2019s in every history book and it always will be.\n\n\"You know, he always said that I love to hate him. So who do I hate now? It seems like I have to find someone else\u2026\"\n\nBoth drivers are set to miss out on the title this year following an underwhelming start to the season.\n\nSix months into his time at Ferrari, Hamilton finds himself sixth in the driver standings.\n\nMeanwhile, Verstappen is third behind McLaren stars Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris.",

Nos, azt, hogy az ut\u00f3bbi 12\u201315 \u00e9vben el\u00e9g gyakran viselkedett \u00fagy, mint egy seggfej. \u0150 teljesen m\u00e1s \u00e9rt\u00e9kek ment\u00e9n m\u0171k\u00f6dik, de m\u00e9g a legnagyobb ellens\u00e9gnek is van egy legjobb bar\u00e1tja. M\u00e1sr\u00e9szt viszont roppant sikeres volt abban, amit csin\u00e1lt. Most, hogy elt\u0171nt, egy id\u0151re legal\u00e1bbis, egy igazi szem\u00e9lyis\u00e9g t\u00e1vozott a sportb\u00f3l. Ellentmond\u00e1sos volt \u00e9s megoszt\u00f3, de itt az egyik f\u0151szerepl\u0151 volt. Nyugodtan mondhatjuk azt, hogy volt olyan jelent\u0151s, mint egy nagy pil\u00f3ta. Ha tiszt\u00e1n F1-es szempontb\u00f3l n\u00e9zem, szerintem m\u00e1r nem sok r\u00e9gi st\u00edlus\u00fa csapatf\u0151n\u00f6k-dinoszaurusz maradt itt. Tal\u00e1n csak \u00e9n.

Azok az \u00e9vek, de k\u00fcl\u00f6n\u00f6sen 2021, nem csup\u00e1n Maxr\u00f3l \u00e9s Lewisr\u00f3l sz\u00f3lt, de Christianr\u00f3l \u00e9s r\u00f3lam is. R\u00e1ad\u00e1sul n\u00e9ha t\u00e9nyleg nagyon neh\u00e9z volt, ez minden t\u00f6rt\u00e9nelemk\u00f6nyvben ott van \u00e9s lesz. Tudod, mindig azt mondta, hogy \u00e9n im\u00e1dom gy\u0171l\u00f6lni \u0151t. Sz\u00f3val most kit gy\u0171l\u00f6ljek? \u00dagy t\u0171nik, tal\u00e1lnom kell valaki m\u00e1st\u2026\u201d\nNem j\u00f6tt be a ground effect korszak\nAz utols\u00f3 millim\u00e9terig ki\u00e9lezett 2021-es id\u00e9ny ut\u00e1n az F1 technikai fronton \u00e1tl\u00e9pett a ground effect aut\u00f3k korszak\u00e1ba, amely a Mercedes sz\u00e1m\u00e1ra nem sok j\u00f3t tartogatott. M\u00edg a Red Bull sikerrel l\u00e9pett \u00e1t az \u00faj \u00e9r\u00e1ba, addig a csillagosoknak semmi nem j\u00f6tt \u00f6ssze, pedig megmozgattak minden k\u00f6vet: lecser\u00e9lt\u00e9k a technikai igazgat\u00f3t, t\u00f6bb \u00edzben koncepci\u00f3t is v\u00e1ltottak, de m\u00edg p\u00e9ld\u00e1ul az er\u0151forr\u00e1saikat haszn\u00e1l\u00f3 McLaren utol\u00e9rte \u00e9s le is k\u00f6r\u00f6zte a domin\u00e1ns energiaitalosokat, addig az egykori sikercsapat futamgy\u0151zelmeket is csup\u00e1n elv\u00e9tve aratott. Ismerve a h\u00e1tteret, az infrastrukt\u00far\u00e1t \u00e9s a tud\u00e1sb\u00e1zist, nehezen \u00e9rtelmezhet\u0151, hogy mi\u00e9rt alakult \u00edgy.\n\u201e\u00dagy gondolom, hogy eg\u00e9sz egyszer\u0171en nem tudtunk megfelel\u0151en alkalmazkodni ehhez a szab\u00e1lyrendszerhez. R\u00f6gt\u00f6n az elej\u00e9t\u0151l fogva h\u00e1tr\u00e1nyban voltunk, azt\u00e1n pedig ilyen remek ellenfelek ellen borzalmasan neh\u00e9z a felz\u00e1rk\u00f3z\u00e1s. Annak az\u00e9rt \u00f6r\u00fcl\u00f6k, hogy volt p\u00e1r sz\u00e9p f\u00e9nypontunk, mint p\u00e9ld\u00e1ul tavaly Silverstone, Lewis utols\u00f3 gy\u0151zelme a Brit Nagyd\u00edjon, de domin\u00e1ltuk Sp\u00e1t \u00e9s abszol\u00fat uraltuk Las Vegast is. N\u00e9ha volt gy\u0151ztes aut\u00f3nk, mint mondjuk id\u00e9n Montrealban, s b\u00edzom benne, hogy lesz m\u00e9g ilyen a szezon h\u00e1tralev\u0151 r\u00e9sz\u00e9ben is\u201d \u2013 magyar\u00e1zta a helyzetet Wolff.\nA szakvezet\u0151 szerint a Mercedes a szezon h\u00e1tralev\u0151 r\u00e9sz\u00e9re m\u00e1r nem k\u00e9sz\u00fcl fejleszt\u00e9sekkel, a megl\u00e9v\u0151 csomaggal oldj\u00e1k meg az \u00e9vad h\u00e1tralev\u0151 r\u00e9sz\u00e9t. Mivel a 2026-ban \u00e9letbe l\u00e9p\u0151 \u00faj szab\u00e1lyok radik\u00e1lis \u00e1talakul\u00e1st hoznak, \u00faj motorformul\u00e1val, ground effect helyett akt\u00edv aerodinamik\u00e1val \u00e9s v\u00e1ltoz\u00f3 gumim\u00e9rettel, az idei tapasztalatok \u00e9s fejleszt\u00e9sek nem lesznek relev\u00e1nsak, de van olyan ter\u00fclet, amelyb\u0151l lehet profit\u00e1lni:\n\u201e\u00dagy gondolom, hogy az oper\u00e1ci\u00f3s ter\u00fcleten mindig van mit tanulni \u00e9s optimaliz\u00e1lni. A k\u00f6lts\u00e9gek kezel\u00e9se is hat\u00e9konyabb lesz\u201d \u2013 mutatott r\u00e1 a Mercedes f\u0151n\u00f6ke.\nRussell: kiv\u00e1l\u00f3 frontharcos, aki v\u00e1r az \u00faj szerz\u0151d\u00e9sre\n2025-re a Mercedes elvesz\u00edtette Lewis Hamiltont, \u00edgy a saj\u00e1t nevel\u00e9s\u0171 \u00fajonc Andrea Kimi Antonelli mellett a szint\u00e9n a juniorprogramb\u00f3l kiker\u00fcl George Russell lett a csapat vez\u00e9rpil\u00f3t\u00e1ja. Wolff szerint a brit hozza, amit hoznia kell, gyakran ann\u00e1l t\u00f6bbet is, \u00edgy a szakvezet\u0151 szerint a pil\u00f3ta frontharcosk\u00e9nt is bev\u00e1lt.\n\u201eNagyon j\u00f3 ezt l\u00e1tni. Csod\u00e1latosan fejl\u0151d\u00f6tt Mercedes-juniork\u00e9nt a Williamsn\u00e9l. Nagyon gyors volt, amikor meg\u00e9rkezett a Mercedeshez, azt\u00e1n fejl\u0151d\u00f6tt Lewis mellett is. Tavaly m\u00e1r \u0151 volt a gyorsabb, most pedig teljesen z\u00f6kken\u0151mentesen v\u00e1lt vez\u00e9rpil\u00f3t\u00e1v\u00e1. T\u00e9nyleg nagyon gyors \u00e9s sz\u00e1mos alkalommal t\u00falteljes\u00edtette azt, amit az aut\u00f3 tud. F\u0151k\u00e9pp akkor l\u00e1tszik, hogy mennyire, amikor az aut\u00f3 nehezen vezethet\u0151. Sz\u00e1momra George egy szuperszt\u00e1r a jelenlegi versenyz\u0151k k\u00f6z\u00f6tt\u201d \u2013 fogalmazott a csapatf\u0151n\u00f6k.\nAz elismer\u0151 szavak ellen\u00e9re Russell \u00faj szerz\u0151d\u00e9se \u2013 noha m\u00e1r b\u0151ven esed\u00e9kes lenne \u2013 m\u00e9g mindig nem sz\u00fcletett meg. Egy ideig ez elfogadhat\u00f3 volt, hiszen es\u00e9ly mutatkozott Max Verstappen szerz\u0151dtet\u00e9s\u00e9re, azonban a holland klasszis az ut\u00f3bbi hetekben t\u00f6bbsz\u00f6r deklar\u00e1lta, hogy a kaotikus \u00e1llapotok ellen\u00e9re sem k\u00edv\u00e1nja elhagyni a Red Bullt, s maga Wolff is kijelentette m\u00e1r, hogy v\u00e1rhat\u00f3an megtartj\u00e1k a jelenlegi pil\u00f3ta\u00f6ssze\u00e1ll\u00edt\u00e1st. M\u00e9gis mire v\u00e1rhatnak? Wolff erre nem adott egy\u00e9rtelm\u0171 v\u00e1laszt:\n\u201eSz\u00e1momra mindig nyilv\u00e1nval\u00f3 volt, hogy George r\u00e9sze a j\u00f6v\u0151nknek, ezt meg is mondtam neki, pontosan tudja. Viszont, tudod, ez egy neh\u00e9z sport. N\u00e9ha nyitva kell hagyni a lehet\u0151s\u00e9geket \u00e9s alaposan ut\u00e1na kell n\u00e9zni, hogy milyen lehet a j\u00f6v\u0151 k\u00f6z\u00e9p- \u00e9s hossz\u00fa t\u00e1von.

  "argos_summary": "Toto Wolff reflects on his rivalry with Christian Horner, calling him a divisive but successful figure whose exit leaves a void in Formula One. He recalls the 2021 title battle between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen as being as much about the two team principals as the drivers. Wolff also comments on Mercedes\u2019 struggles in the current season, the shift to ground\u2011effect cars, and the future of the team\u2019s drivers, noting George Russell\u2019s potential contract and the challenges of negotiating with top talent. He concludes that while the sport is changing, the old\u2011style team\u2011boss dinosaurs are fading.",
