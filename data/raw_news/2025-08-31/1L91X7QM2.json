      "text": "Content written by Forbes Vetted Contributors is assigned, reviewed and edited by Forbes Staff\nI am a freelance writer specializing in wellness, home & lifestyle.\nMar 07, 2024, 05:14pm EST\nElectric dryers ultimately have one straightforward task: To ensure your clothes and linens come out perfectly dry every time. The best electric dryers, though, have added features that go beyond the basics\u2014think specialized cycles, steam cleaning options and smart capabilities. In 2024, our top pick is Samsung\u2019s 7.5 Cu. Ft. Electric Dryer, a spacious model with 12 preset cycles and useful features like a lint filter indicator.\nIn case you\u2019re not well-versed in dryer types, these essential appliances can generally be divided into two categories: gas and electric. Whereas the former require a gas hookup to operate, electric dryers plug into an outlet and use metal heating coils to dry clothes quickly, explains Angi home expert Mallory Micetich. Electric dryers are typically more popular than their gas counterparts, and they tend to be less expensive. Of course, the best dryer for you ultimately depends on several factors about your own lifestyle, including the capacity you need, how interested you are in special features, whether you want a stackable washer and dryer and, of course, your budget. Once you\u2019ve determined those, take a look at our curated list of the best electric dryers on the market, ahead.\nCapacity: 7.5 cubic feet | Size: 31.4 x 27 x 38.9 inches | Special features: Sensor Dry, Steam Sanitize, Lint Filter Indicator, Energy Saver | Energy Star certified: Yes | Warranty: 1 year limited\nSimply put, this electric dryer checks the most important boxes. With a 7.5-cubic-foot capacity, the WiFi-enabled model is roomy enough for the needs of most families and offers 12 preset cycles to find that just-right level of dryness for you. It also comes with a suite of cool features: Along with expected ones like Sensor Dry and Energy Saver, it offers a Steam Sanitize+ cycle (which removes up to 95% of pollen from fabric) and a lint filter indicator. The door is reversible, too, so you can configure it to meet the needs of your laundry space. Another nice feature: The dryer has a smart care system, allowing you to troubleshoot any issues using the brand\u2019s companion app.\nBest Budget Electric Dryer\nA Reliable, Affordable Pick\nWhirlpool 7 Cu. Ft. Electric Dryer\nCapacity: 7 cubic feet | Size: 28.3 x 29 x 43 inches | Special features: AutoDry drying system, Wrinkle Shield technology | Energy Star certified: No | Warranty: 1 year limited\nYou don\u2019t need to drop around $1,000 to get an electric dryer you can rely on. Case in point: this 7-cubic-foot model from Whirlpool. It has three temperature settings and 14 cycles, as well as an end-of-cycle alarm. While you can manually control the length of each cycle, this pick comes equipped with AutoDry technology, which helps prevent your clothes and linens from over-drying. The dryer also has an anti-wrinkle option; when selected, the model intermittently tumbles freshly laundered clothes to stop wrinkles from setting in before you have a chance to unload. You also don\u2019t have to worry about your dried clothes falling on the ground with this model, thanks to its extra-wide drop-down door that makes unloading (and loading) a cinch.\nBest Large-Capacity Electric Dryer\nA Model That Can Handle A Full Set Of King-Sized Bedding\nLG Turbosteam 9 Cu. Ft. Stackable Smart Electric Dryer\nCapacity: 9 cubic feet | Size: 32 x 29 x 40.8 inches | Special features: Turbosteam technology, Flowsense Duct Clogging Indicator | Energy Star certified: Yes | Warranty: 1 year (general), 3 years (drum)\nWhether you have a larger family or just prefer to run your dryer as little as possible, the LG TurboSteam has a whopping nine cubic foot capacity that\u2019s one of the largest you\u2019ll find on the market. But, while you can fit a full set of king size bedding in a single load, this dryer has more going for it than just its spacious size. Enjoy LG Turbosteam technology to work out wrinkles in 10 minutes or less, while the brand\u2019s special ThinQ App lets you control the laundry from wherever you are. There\u2019s even a Flowsense Duct Clogging Indicator to tip you off to when it\u2019s time to clean out your ducts. While you\u2019re probably not pinning your decision on how the inside of your dryer looks, it\u2019s also good to know that the dryer\u2019s stainless steel drum won\u2019t show its age over time.\nBest Front-Load Electric Dryer\nA Sleek Appliance With 36 Cycle Combinations\nWhirlpool 7.4 Cu. Ft. Electric Wrinkle Shield Dryer\nCapacity: 7.4 cubic feet | Size: 28.3 x 29 x 43 inches | Special features: Advanced Moisture setting, Wrinkle Shield technology | Energy Star certified: Yes | Warranty: 1 year limited\nWhirlpool\u2019s front load dryer offers up plenty of nice features to make your laundry experience seamless, including some you may not have thought of. This sleek dryer boasts three sensors to help protect your clothes against over-drying by tracking moisture and temperature, while also ensuring it avoid the dreaded still-damp phenomenon once the cycle is done. Flip between 36 cycle combinations to find the one that\u2019s right for your particular load. There\u2019s even a sanitize cycle to help tackle 99.9% of common household bacteria. A wrinkle shield feature offers extended tumbling after the cycle ends to help lower the risk you\u2019ll need to iron.\nWhat our testers say: While using this dryer, \u201cclothes came out very dry every time,\u201d says one of Vetted\u2019s testers. What\u2019s more, \u201cthe estimated dry times were very close, and more often than not, clothes were done faster.\u201d\nBest Stackable Electric Dryer\nA Dryer With A 30-Inch Depth Ideal For Small Spaces\nLG 7.4 Cu. Ft. Stackable Electric Dryer\nCapacity: 7.4 cubic feet | Size: 30 x 39 x 39 inches | Special features: Sensor dry, Flowsense Duct Clogging Indicator, EasyIron | Energy Star certified: Yes | Warranty: 1 year limited\nThis dryer from LG was specially designed to be stackable, allowing you to make good use of valuable floor space. A roomy 7.4 cubic foot capacity holds plenty of clothes, while Sensor Dry helps detect when you load needs more time or can call it quits early. The dryer is known for its quiet operation, allowing you to run it any time of day without worrying about being disturbed. A neat additional feature to consider if you have to dress up for work: The dryer\u2019s EasyIron option will lightly moisten your clothes for easy ironing if you prefer to finish your items off that way. And when it\u2019s time to clean out the model\u2019s ducts, the Flowsense Duct Clogging Indicator will notify you.\nBest Energy-Efficient Electric Dryer\nAn Energy Star-Certified Machine With A 15-Minute Fast-Dry Option\nElectrolux 8 Cu. Ft. Stackable Electric Dryer\nCapacity: 8 cubic feet | Size: 32 x 27 x 38 inches | Special features: Predictive Dry, Perfect Steam, Instant Refresh, Sanitize Cycle | Energy Star certified: Yes | Warranty: 1 year limited\nWith an 8-cubic-foot capacity, this dryer from Electrolux is Energy Star-Certified and has several features to help you avoid running your dryer for too long. The appliance\u2019s Predictive Dry feature quickly figures out the perfect cycle time for your load to give you the optimal run time without wasting energy, while the 15-minute fast-dry option lets you get that pair of jeans out of the wash and on your body as quickly as possible. Flip between nine cycles to find the one that\u2019s right for you, as well as a Perfect Steam wrinkle-releasing feature to keep your clothes smooth and ready to go, right out of the dryer. It also has a cool Instant Refresh cycle, which revives lightly worn items by tossing them for 10 minutes.\nBest Electric Clothes Dryer With Steam Cleaning\nA Roomy Dryer That Takes Out 99.8% Of Bacteria\nGE Profile 7.8 Cu. Ft. Smart Front-Load Electric Dryer\nCapacity: 7.8 cubic feet | Size: 32 x 28 x 39.8 inches | Special features: Steam Sanitize | Energy Star certified: Yes | Warranty: 1 year limited\nThis GE Profile dryer features steam cleaning that can help take out wrinkles and reduce odor. It also uses the power of steam to tackle up to 99.8% of certain types of bacteria to give you a deep clean. The brand\u2019s SmartHQ features allow you to stop, start and keep an eye on your laundry from anywhere thanks to your phone. The dryer even personalizes your cycle selections automatically once it learns your preferences, making it even faster to get clothes that are perfectly dry. A gentle mist toward the end of your cycle reduces static, and you can even enjoy a quick dry cycle to tackle small loads when you\u2019re in a hurry. At 7.8 cubic feet, this dryer is slightly roomier than average.\nBest Smart Electric Clothes Dryer\nA Dryer That Lets You Start Your Cycle While You're At Brunch\nLG 7.4 Cu. Ft. Stackable Smart Electric Dryer\nCapacity: 7.4 cubic feet | Size: 27 x 30 x 39 inches | Special features: Sensor Dry, Built-In Intelligence, ThinQ Technology | Energy Star certified: Yes | Warranty: 1 year limited\nSmart features aren\u2019t for everyone, but can make laundry an easier experience for those who rely on them. This dryer features ThinQ technology, which syncs your machine to an app on your phone, allowing you to do things like put your dryer on wrinkle release when you\u2019re on your way home from brunch to get perfectly crisp clothes when the timing is right. The dryer features Sensor Dry to detect moisture in your clothes and adjust the cycle accordingly. It also has a quiet operation, so you don\u2019t have to stress about disturbing you or family members when it runs. It\u2019s also stackable in case your space is limited.\nTo determine the top models currently on the market, we first spoke with experts in the field about the qualities that distinguish a great electric dryer from one that\u2019s subpar. We then scanned the market, identifying the most popular electric dryers you can buy right now. Factoring in what we learned from the experts, as well as customer reviews, we narrowed down our list to the best of the best.\nWhat To Look For In An Electric Dryer\nReady to upgrade your laundry setup with a new electric dryer? While comparing different models, consider capacity, design, energy efficiency and more.\nCapacity\nThe right electric dryer capacity for you depends on two factors: the size of your household and your personal preferences. Many quality models feature capacities of 7.4 cubic feet, which is a generous size that can handle most loads. If you have a large family or prefer to run your dryer as little as possible, though, you may want to consider something with a larger capacity. The LG Turbosteam has a spacious 9-cubic-foot capacity, making it ideal for people who want something extra roomy.\nStackability\nIf floor space is limited, you may want to consider stacking your washer and dryer. Just keep in mind that you can\u2019t stack any old model\u2014you need ones designed to sit on top one another. You also need to make sure you have the right equipment to link your vent to your dry, Micetich notes, and that you can comfortably reach all of the parts of your appliances that you\u2019d need to access. Careful measurements are important\u2014the depth, height and width of your machine should all be considered.\nEnergy Efficiency\nEnergy efficiency can help save you money down the road, especially if you tend to use your dryer frequently. Additionally, some models come with added features that can help keep down the cost of your electrical bill. For example, \u201csome electric dryers have sensors that can detect when your clothes are dry, which can help make them more energy efficient,\u201d Micetich says.\nAdditional Features\nMany of today\u2019s electric dryers boast enticing features like smart connectivity, steaming and sensor drying, all of which can make your laundry experience smarter and more efficient. Before you hit checkout on a souped-up model with tons of added features, though, it\u2019s important to consider which ones you\u2019ll actually use. Additional features typically raise the overall cost of the machine, and you don\u2019t want to pay extra for something you won\u2019t ever take advantage of.\nWhat Is An Electric Dryer?\nAn electric dryer is the most common type of dryer on the market right now\u2014and at baseline, they all work the same way. \u201cAn electric dryer is an appliance that uses heat from an electric heating element to heat the clothes or garments and then pushes the moisture in the air out through a dryer duct then outside the house or building,\u201d explains JustAnswer home and appliance expert Aaron Wilson. Many electric dryers have plenty of added features like smart connectivity, steam cleaning and sensory drying to optimize your run time and laundry experience.\nHow Is An Electric Dryer Different From A Gas Dryer?\nA gas dryer uses a flame instead of an electric heating element. What\u2019s more, \u201cit uses less electricity than an electric dryer,\u201d Wilson says, explaining that it uses natural gas as a fuel source for the heat. A big downside of a gas dryer is that you need to have gas plumbed into your home or building. \u201cElectric dryers are typically cheaper to purchase, require less maintenance, can be easily installed and can last up to 14 years,\u201d Micetich says. \u201cThat said, electric dryers take longer to heat up and can be more expensive to run per load.\u201d\nWhat Is The Best Electric Dryer?\nOur top overall pick is the Samsung\u2019s 7.5 Cu. Ft. Electric Dryer, which offers excellent features like a sensory dry mode and 10 preset cycles to choose from. That said, the best electric dryer for you ultimately depends on your individual needs. \u201cWhen looking for a dryer, I would look at what programs it has,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cFor example, I need a dryer that has a permanent press and a wrinkle release program, but I don\u2019t necessarily need a dryer that can use steam. So, when shopping for a dryer, look for what you will use often to help guide you.\u201d"

      "text": "If you haven\u2019t shopped for a washer and dryer in a few years, you might be surprised by how much these essential appliances have improved. Today\u2019s best washer and dryer sets not only look better in your laundry room, they also come loaded with features to make doing laundry simpler, faster and more energy efficient. Our top pick, the single-unit LG WashTower, even sends laundry updates to your phone and has an allergen detection setting. But there are plenty of other excellent options depending on your budget, your laundry needs and the size of your household.\nBefore getting into specific models, it\u2019s important to figure out what will actually work best in your space. Glenn Lewis, president of Mr. Appliance, recommends starting with some basic planning: \u201cStart by measuring the space in your laundry room. That immediately narrows your options and prevents surprises later,\u201d he says. \u201cThen think about your current needs for the amount of laundry you do and what you will be doing for the next ten to twelve years.\u201d With his advice in mind, we made sure our recommendations cover a range of real-life scenarios\u2014from large-capacity sets for busy families to compact and stackable models that can fit in smaller spaces. Our team regularly researches, tests and updates our recommendations, so you can feel confident you\u2019re choosing a set that\u2019ll work well for you long-term. (And if you need something even more specific, we have separate guides on the best washing machines, thebest electric dryers and the best stackable washer and dryer sets.)\nA Smartly Designed Duo That's Easy For Anyone To Use\nLG WashTower\nType: Front load |Size: 27 x 74.4 x 30.4 inches |Capacity: 4.5 cubic feet (washer), 7.4 cubic feet (dryer) |Washing cycles: 5 | Drying cycles: 9 |Energy Star certified: Yes\nPros:\nEasy-to-reach control panel\nRuns quietly\nWater-efficient\nSensor drying prevents overdrying\nCons:\nLarge back vent may be tricky in tight spaces\nLimited preset drying options\nSome users report surface scratches\nThe LG WashTower is designed to save space and keep laundry as painless as possible, especially if you\u2019re tired of reaching for controls at the top of a stacked set. The washer and dryer controls sit right in the middle, so they're easy to see and reach, even if you're on the shorter side. It fits a solid amount of laundry, too\u2014the washer holds 4.5 cubic feet, plenty for a typical family's weekly load, while the dryer offers a roomy 7.4 cubic feet, great for blankets and bulky items. It also has a steam cycle specifically meant to remove dust and other allergens from clothes, which can make a big difference if someone in your home struggles with allergies. You can even start cycles or get a quick alert on your phone through LG's ThinQ app, which lets you check on laundry without heading back and forth to the machine.\nWhat the reviews say: One reviewer notes, \u201cThe digital readout always tells you how much time is left in your cycle. [This set] did a nice job of washing and drying a load and it was very simple to operate. ... It has lots of bells and whistles others we've looked at didn't have, but it doesn\u2019t sacrifice ease of use.\u201d\nBest Top-Loading Washer And Dryer Set\nA Roomy Set That Powers Through Heavy Laundry Days\nMaytag Smart Top-Load Set\nType: Top load (washer), front load (dryer) | Size: 27.3 x 27.9 x 42.9 inches (washer), 27 x 29.9 x 43.1 inches (dryer) | Capacity: 5.2 cubic feet (washer), 7.4 cubic feet (dryer) |Washing cycles: 13 | Drying cycles: 11 | Energy Star certified: No\nPros:\nWasher easily handles big, bulky loads\nQuick-wash and quick-dry cycles\nExtra Power options for heavy-duty cleaning and drying\nWasher is quieter than average\nCons:\nDryer can get loud during heavy cycles\nDryer controls take some getting used to\nIf you\u2019re regularly dealing with large piles of laundry, this Maytag set can handle heavy loads so you won't have to run multiple cycles. The top-loading washer holds 5.2 cubic feet, which is more than enough space for a large load of towels, heavy bedding or bulky clothes. It also has an \"Extra Power\" feature, which gets rid of tough stains by running a stronger pre-wash with extra agitation; for especially dirty or heavy loads, there's a Deep Fill setting that adds more water to the cycle. And if you're in a hurry, the Quick Wash setting cleans smaller loads in just 30 minutes.\nThe matching dryer is just as capable, with a roomy 7.4-cubic-foot drum and sensors that help prevent clothes from getting overdried or staying damp. It also features its own Extra Power option, which uses higher heat and more tumbling action to dry thicker fabrics like jeans or blankets. Both machines connect to Maytag\u2019s smart app so you can start or monitor your laundry without running back and forth to check on the progress.\nWhat our experts say: Executive managing editor Emmy Favilla is impressed with the Maytag Smart Top-Load Washer\u2019s stain-removal abilities, spaciousness, efficiency and quiet operation. She reports, \u201cIt allows me to wash two loads at a time (instead of one, as with my old machine). The agitator is very small, yet powerful, which allows for more laundry to fit. I also find that I use only one-third of the detergent I needed to use previously with my standard washer, saving me a great deal of money in the long run.\u201d\nBest Front-Loading Washer And Dryer Set\nUses Steam And Smart Detergent Mixing To Get Clothes Cleaner\nElectrolux Front-Load Perfect Steam Set\nType: Front load | Size: 38 x 27 x 32 inches (washer), 38 x 27 x 32 inches (dryer) | Capacity: 4.5 cubic feet (washer), 8 cubic feet (dryer) |Washing cycles: 10 | Drying cycles: 10 |Energy Star certified: Yes\nPros:\nFast wash and dry cycles (15 minutes each)\nWasher premixes detergent for more thorough cleaning\nRuns quietly\nCons:\nSome users say doors don\u2019t always latch easily\nStacking kit not included\nThis Electrolux set is especially good if you're particular about how your clothes are cleaned. Instead of just swirling clothes around a typical agitator, the washer releases steam from the bottom of the drum to gently lift stains without wearing out fabrics. It also has a smart feature called the Adaptive Dispenser; this mixes detergent with water first, which prevents harsh detergent spots and ensures stains get more evenly treated.\nThe accompanying LuxCare Front-Load Electric Dryer (also available in a gas version) has a large 8-cubic-foot drum\u2014enough room for bulky bedding and thick towels\u2014and sensors that stop it before clothes overdry. There's also a useful quick-refresh cycle, ideal for clothes you've worn just briefly and don't need to fully wash yet. If you sometimes forget your laundry in the dryer, the extended tumble feature occasionally rotates clothes (without heat) to prevent wrinkles until you're ready to unload. Both machines have fast, 15-minute cycles, and if you plan to stack them, you'll just need Electrolux\u2019s front-load laundry stacking kit.\nWhat the reviews say: One customer reports, \u201cLove this washer/dryer pair. The washer does a great job in half the time of my old [machine]. The dryer has great features like 18-minute fast dry and extended tumble. They look great in my laundry room.\u201d\nBest Compact Washer And Dryer Set\nA Compact, Ventless Set That's Great For Small Apartments\nBosch 300 Series Compact Ventless Set\nType: Front load | Size: 23.5 x 24.3 x 33.3 inches (washer), 23.5 x 25 x 33.3 inches (dryer) | Capacity: 2.2 cubic feet (washer), 4 cubic feet (dryer) | Washing cycles: 15 | Drying cycles: 15 | Energy Star certified: Yes\nPros:\nIdeal size for apartments and tight spaces\nPlenty of cycle options\nEfficient with water and electricity\nCons:\nSmall capacity isn\u2019t ideal for larger families\nDryer requires airflow\u2014door needs to be left open if installed in a closet\nThe Bosch 300 Series washer and dryer set works well if you have limited laundry space. At just under 24 inches wide and about 33 inches high, both machines comfortably fit into closets, under counters or in cramped apartments. Despite their smaller size, the brand claims you can wash about 18 standard-sized towels per load, which is more than enough for most small households. You also get an impressive number of washing cycles (15 total), including specialty options like Heavy Soil for tougher stains or Delicates for gentler fabrics. The washer uses sensors to adjust the water level based on how dirty your laundry is, which helps use less water overall, and the drum\u2019s interior shape is designed to prevent clothes from getting tangled or worn out.\nThe dryer is ventless, meaning it doesn\u2019t need an external exhaust, so you can install it virtually anywhere. It holds about 15 pounds of laundry, which is the equivalent of around 16 towels, and gives you a full range of drying options (also 15 cycles), including settings like Sanitize for bedding, Quick 40 for a fast turnaround, Jeans for heavier denim and Air Fluff for freshening clothes without heat. Because it's ventless, it can take slightly longer to dry your clothes fully, and you'll need to clean the lint filter after each use, plus the condensation unit every few weeks, to keep drying times efficient.\nWhat our experts say: Updates writerFran Sales, who\u2019s used this pair for years as a stacked set in two small New York City apartments, says, \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re both under 24 inches wide and 25 inches deep and can be stacked has been a game changer in both places I\u2019ve lived in. We can fit the set in a closet with a bit of room to spare on both sides (for our cleaning supplies) and at the top (for our detergents). It helps that this set is ventless, too, though it\u2019s important to make sure to clean the lint catcher with every use and the condensation unit every month. But, that\u2019s a small price to pay for not having to schlep our loads to the laundromat down the street.\u201d\nBest Washer-Dryer Combo\nWashes And Dries Clothes In One Ventless Machine\nGE Front-Load Washer/Condenser Dryer Combo\nSize: 33.3 x 23.4 x 25.6 inches | Capacity: 2.4 cubic feet | Special features: No vent required, steam wash, sanitize cycle, \u201cadd a garment\u201d feature | Energy Star certified: Yes\nPros:\nNo external vent necessary\nQuiet enough to run anytime\nEasy to fit almost anywhere\nCons:\nDrying takes longer than separate units\nThis GE washer-dryer combo does everything in one spot, so you don\u2019t have to buy two separate appliances. It\u2019s a great solution if you want to simplify your setup or avoid dealing with dryer vents. The machine itself is just over 33 inches tall and about 23 inches wide, so it easily slides under most counters or into closets without special hookups.\nThe 2.4-cubic-foot drum isn\u2019t huge but comfortably fits an average-sized load of laundry. You can adjust water temperature, spin speed and soil levels to match different fabric types or how dirty your clothes are. If something\u2019s particularly messy, there's a steam wash cycle to loosen stains and a sanitize cycle that's great for towels, bedding or baby clothes. Plus, if you find a stray sock after starting a load, just press a button to pause mid-cycle and toss it in. One thing to note: drying takes noticeably longer compared to traditional dryers, but having just one compact unit doing both washing and drying can save you money, space and hassle in the long run.\nWhat the reviews say: One reviewer who\u2019s frequently on the road says this combo model works great for their wheel trailer. \u201cIt's amazing to have the ability to clean clothes without going to a laundromat. I load three pants, three shirts and the same amount of days\u2019 worth of underwear and socks; it cleaned and dried them perfectly. [...] I like the ability to start the load of laundry and leave knowing it will all be done without [manually needing to switch] from washer to dryer.\u201d\nThe Forbes Vetted home and kitchen team has published dozens of laundry-focused guides and regularly tests appliances to recommend the best options for a variety of homes.\nThis article was written by home and kitchen editor Kelly O\u2019Sullivan and home updates writer Fran Sales, who have a combined experience of over a decade covering appliances and lifestyle products.\nWe spoke with two appliance experts: Glenn Lewis, president of Mr. Appliance, a Neighborly brand; and Dennis Godynuk, owner of Comfort Appliance Repair. They each shared additional insights into what matters most when buying a washer and dryer.\nWe update this story regularly to ensure pricing and specs are accurate and our recommendations remain current. It was most recently updated in June 2025.\nHow We Chose The Best Washer And Dryer Sets\nTo select the best washer and dryer sets, we considered expert input, real-world feedback and our team\u2019s firsthand experience with multiple models.\nWe focused on trusted brands like LG, Bosch, Samsung, GE, Whirlpool and Electrolux.\nWe prioritized models with at least four-star average ratings and features that simplify laundry day, like moisture sensors, steam cycles and smart connectivity. We also looked for energy- and water-efficient designs, as well as space-saving features like closet-depth profiles and reversible dryer doors.\nOur picks include a mix of full-size, compact, ventless and all-in-one units to fit a range of households and layouts.\nWhat To Look For In The Best Washer And Dryer Sets\nA washer and dryer set is a major home investment, so it\u2019s worth slowing down to make sure the model you choose actually fits your space, your laundry habits and your budget. Here\u2019s what our experts say to keep in mind:\nSet Vs. Solo Purchases\nBuying a washer and dryer set can be convenient, especially if you\u2019re redoing your laundry room or outfitting a new home. But it\u2019s not always necessary to replace both at once. \u201cThere is no reason to replace a working appliance,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cIf the units are side by side, you could mix them\u2014but not if you need them to be stacked.\u201d Consider how your setup affects compatibility before committing to a full set.\nFront-Load Vs. Top-Load\nBoth front- and top-loading machines have their pros and cons. \u201cFront-load washers generally have a larger capacity, but top-loaders are quickly catching up,\u201d says Lewis. The right fit often comes down to preference and comfort. \u201cBoth types use different muscles to load and unload,\u201d he adds. \u201cTry them in the store and see what works best for your body type.\u201d Also think about layout: front-load machines can be stacked to save space, while top-load models are easier to load without bending over.\nSize And Fit\nBefore you fall in love with a machine online, make sure it\u2019ll physically fit in your space. That includes measuring for height, width and depth, as well as accounting for hookups, vents and clearance. You\u2019ll also want to factor in drum capacity. A single person might get by with 2.5 to 3.5 cubic feet, while a household of four or more will likely want something larger.\nSpecial Features\nModern washers and dryers are packed with high-tech extras: smartphone controls, steam cycles, auto-dispensing detergent and more. But not everyone needs them. \u201cPeople often ask about smart features like Wi-Fi,\u201d says Dennis Godynuk, owner of Comfort Appliance Repair. \u201cI tell them, \u2018If you\u2019re not checking your phone every time you wash, it\u2019s extra cost for something you won\u2019t use.\u2019\u201d Likewise, steam cycles can be useful for certain fabrics but may not justify the added expense for every household.\nBudget\nYou don\u2019t have to spend top dollar to get a good machine. There are plenty of well-reviewed models at lower price points that offer reliable cleaning and drying performance. Just know what you\u2019re giving up. \u201cA customer might save money buying a basic model,\u201d Godynuk says. \u201cBut they\u2019re usually sacrificing things like shorter cycles, better sensors or energy savings.\u201d Decide what features you\u2019ll actually use and which ones you\u2019re okay skipping."

      "text": "Laundry day is a chore, but the right machines can make it a little less laborious. Whereas an unreliable washer can leave you with clothes that are damp or pilled, the best washing machines get your clothes clean in a safe and timely manner. Our top pick for most households is the high-efficiency LG Turbowash Front-Load Washer, a smart and spacious model that can capture allergens and tackle smaller loads in just 15 minutes. If you\u2019d prefer a top-load model or perhaps something that\u2019s a little more budget-friendly, though, there are plenty of other great washing machines that can help make laundry day a breeze.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the market for a washing machine, it\u2019s ultimately important to find one that best fits your lifestyle,\u201d says Mallory Micetich, home expert at Angi. To help ensure you bring home one that makes sense for your household, start by considering the model\u2019s capacity and wash cycles, both of which can make a difference in how seamless laundry day is for you. Additionally, smart features like the ability to control your washer from your phone might appeal to you if you\u2019re often on the go; if you tend to be home often and can easily access your machine when the need strikes, those extra features might be an unnecessary cost. While doing laundry will likely never be your favorite day, investing in a high-quality washing machine (and a top-notch electric dryer) can help make it slightly more enjoyable. Ahead, here are the best models on the market right now.\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\nThe Forbes Vetted team home team consists of three seasoned editors who have extensive backgrounds in researching, testing and reviewing products, from toaster ovens to portable air conditioners. We also make sure to consult relevant experts whenever we\u2019re researching a category. For this story, we reached out to Mallory Micetich, home expert at Angi, and JustAnswer home and appliance pro Aaron Wilson. Lastly, we regularly revisit this story to review product choices and update pricing; it was last updated in February 2024.\nHow We Chose The Best Washing Machines\nTo determine the best washing machines on the market, we started by speaking with two appliance experts for their input on what separates a high-quality washer from one that\u2019s unreliable. We then tracked down the most popular models on the market and narrowed the field based on features like capacity, cycle settings and value. One washing machine, the Maytag Smart Top-Load Washer, was tested by one of our contributors. Lastly, we took customer reviews into consideration to see how these washers have held up for a wide variety of users.\nWhat To Look For In A Washing Machine\nThe best washing machine for your household ultimately depends on your personal needs, space allotment, budget and preference of features. Keep these in mind during your search.\nCapacity\nA washer\u2019s capacity is the amount of laundry it can hold in one load, and it\u2019s measured in cubic feet. Many washers are around 4.5 cubic feet, which is a great size for most families. However, larger households may want to consider a washer with a capacity that\u2019s 5 cubic feet or larger. If you have a smaller household or don\u2019t mind doing several loads, a washer that\u2019s 2.5 or so cubic feet can still handle your needs without hogging a lot of your designated laundry area.\nFeatures\nToday\u2019s washers tend to have plenty of features their older counterparts never had. Those include options like steam cleaning to really lift away stubborn dirt, reversible doors and smart technology to help sense how dirty your clothes actually are. Some washers even have WiFi connectivity to allow you to monitor and control your loads from your phone. Keep in mind that, in most circumstances, the more features a washer has, the higher the cost. So if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need or use them, it may be better to opt for a product with fewer features.\nCycles\nWash cycles give you options beyond just getting your clothes clean. Most washers have the standard normal, permanent press, heavy duty and delicates cycles, but some washing machines offer additional elements that appeal to a certain user. Consider sanitizing cycles to get rid of bacteria that may be lurking on your wardrobe along with allergen removal to specially weed out pollen and other triggers that could be embedded in your clothes. Some models also feature steam cycles to help get a deeper clean and lift away stains.\nEnergy Efficiency\nEnergy efficiency can make a difference in your utility bill. Washers that are energy efficient are designed to use less water than others (and heat less water), requiring less energy in the process. In fact, Energy Star\u2013certified products use about 20% less energy and 30% less water, according to the program (which is run by the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy). Consider that when shopping for a new machine\u2014it may be worth it to raise your budget slightly to ensure you get savings over time.\nWhich Is The Most Reliable Washing Machine Brand?\nThere are a lot of washing machine brands that are reliable, and they\u2019re generally the home appliance companies that you\u2019re already familiar with. For example, LG, GE, Samsung, Miele and Electrolux are known for delivering quality washers that last. Our top pick is the LG Turbowash Front-Load Washer, which is packed with features with a price tag that isn\u2019t overwhelming. However, there are a range of reliable washers on our list to consider, too.\nAre Front Loading Washing Machines Better Than Top Loading Machines?\nOne isn\u2019t necessarily better than the other\u2014it just depends on your needs. Still, front load washing machines are increasingly popular, and for a few reasons. \u201cThey are gentler on your clothes and bedding, so they will last longer,\u201d says JustAnswer home and appliance expert Aaron Wilson. \u201cFront load washers use less water as well. Also, they are great for people with disabilities since you don\u2019t have to reach down inside the unit from the top.\u201d A downside, though, is that they tend to cost more than top loaders. \u201cTop loaders are typically cheaper than front load washers and the newer style of top load washers that don\u2019t have the conventional agitator in the middle of the tub are much gentler on the clothes and bedding than previous top loaders,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cTop loaders also have an advantage for taller people as you don\u2019t have to bend down as you do with a front loader.\u201d\nWhat Are Some Of The Essential Features To Look For In A Washing Machine?\nIt depends on what is important to you. \u201cI recommend considering a washing machine\u2019s capacity as well as some of the upgraded features newer models have like pre-treating options, load weight sensing and balancing,\u201d Micetich says. Wilson also suggests looking for advance cycles like sanitizing wash, steam clean and ones targeted for activewear. \u201cAlso, a great cycle to look for is a clean cycle\u2014that way you can use washing machine cleaner tablets to keep your unit clean and running well,\u201d he says. No matter what machine you buy, Wilson shares this important advice: \u201cAlways have a surge protector for your washing machine. Today\u2019s washing machines rely heavily on electronic control boards and drive boards. You can protect them with a surge protector.\u201d"
