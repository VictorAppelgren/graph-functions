  "description": "And we've got the iPads that are confirmed to run the iPadOS 26 beta, too.",
  "content": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products .\n\nYour iPhone and iPad's operating systems are getting big upgrades this fall with the release of iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. My favorite coming to both is the visual update, called Liquid Glass \u2014 it's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista. We spent two weeks test-driving it \u2014 you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 6 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Not ready to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your phone will be able to run iOS 26.\n\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 \u2014 a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall.\n\nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT.\n\nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\n\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall \u2014 though there are iPhone 17 rumors \u2014 we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\u2022 None iPhone SE (second generation or later)\n\nThe iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26.\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\n\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\n\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\n\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September.\n\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\n\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\n\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.\n\nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.",

      "text": "Apple's Liquid Glass is Windows Vista done well\nAero, is that you?\nIt's hard to look at Apple's new \"Liquid Glass\" aesthetic and not think about Windows Vista, Microsoft's much-maligned OS which also touted transparencies and glass-like effects as a bold new vision for computing. You can see the similarities between Apple's UI and Vista's \"Windows Aero\" design language everywhere, from the glassified app icons in iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe 26 which look a lot like VIsta's glossy icons, to the transparent backgrounds used in drop down menus, which hearken back to VIsta's transparent window borders. The key difference is that Apple is just doing it all better. (Sorry, not sorry, Windows fans.)\nWhile Microsoft started off with an intriguing idea, it failed to execute the Windows Aero UI well in Vista. Mostly, that's because Vista itself was a huge mess \u2014 it was far slower than Windows XP, it was notoriously buggy and it handled drivers poorly. And if you actually wanted to partake in the glory of Aero transparency bars, you needed a computer with a powerful GPU. That was far more rare in 2007 than it is today, when even integrated graphics can run basic 3D and fancy UI elements well. With its homegrown chips, Apple also provides decent graphics capabilities in its devices that support iOS 26, iPadOS 26 and other new software releases with Liquid Glass.\nIt also helps that Liquid Glass isn't really a huge change for Apple, unlike the jump from Windows XP to Vista. Apple has been creeping towards a flashier UI and more widespread use of transparencies ever since iOS 7 was released in 2013, which dropped the archaic skeuomorphic design trend in favor of a flatter and more stylish aesthetic. So sure, your icons and menus may have a bit more shine to them in iOS 26, but they mostly work the way you remember. (You could also argue Apple itself kickstarted the move towards transparencies in desktop operating systems with the original Mac OS X in 2001, which gave its iconic dock a glossy background.)\nI can argue for the overall wisdom of Apple's Liquid Glass, at least compared to Windows Vista, and personally I also think it gives iOS a much-needed dose of personality. But I can't really convince you otherwise if you think it looks ugly, as many of my Engadget colleagues do. Senior News Editor Avery Ellis calls it \"busy and obnoxious,\" and Editor-in-Chief Aaron Souppouris noted that \"it truly feels like Aero, rooted in the mid '00s.... I don't need light refracting around my pause button.\" Fair complaints! And as usual, you can also reduce transparency effects and motion elements in Apple's Accessibility Settings, if these elements truly bother you.\nBut after spending a bit of time with the first iOS 26 developer beta, I'm more intrigued by Liquid Glass than anything else. It makes app icons look like tiny jewels that I just want to touch, and I dig the transparency effects throughout the OS \u2014 they almost seem like a preview for a future where we're using holographic Apple devices. (That's also something I felt while using visionOS on the Vision Pro, which served as the launchpad for Liquid Glass.) I also genuinely love iOS 26's revamped Safari, which lets you browse completely in full screen. As you scroll down, the location bar at the bottom of your screen shrinks and gets out of the way. But if you scroll up or tap into the location bar, it pops back up to give you the sharing and navigation options you're used to.\nIt could also be that I'm a sucker for novelty. Back in my Windows XP days, I used to use apps like WindowBlinds to customize the OS and add transparent effects. And there are signs that Apple may be going a bit too far with transparencies, like with the iOS 26's Control Center (above). It looks fine if you're swiping it down while inside an app, but if you're on the home screen, it's just one of many levels of glass-like windows. I could see that being a bit overbearing for some users.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that interface redesigns are often rejected at first glance, especially since you\u2019re seeing them abstracted through screenshots and videos. Even Apple\u2019s slick marketing magic doesn\u2019t replicate the experience of using Liquid Design. In my experience, iOS 26 really isn\u2019t that different from everything that came before. Once you get over the initial shock of a new interface, you may see it with new eyes.\nThere's also still plenty of time until Apple's new operating systems arrive this fall though, and the company is often quick to tweak major design changes if beta users complain about them. I could see Apple toning down the Control Center's transparent background, or even better, giving users more control over the amount of Liquid Glass elements on your screen. Personally, I don\u2019t mind it when companies stretch their interface ideals a bit too far \u2013 there\u2019s always room to move back. That\u2019s far better than being too conservative and never really pushing your aesthetic vision forward."

      "text": "How to install the iOS 26 public beta\nThis guide will also show you how to access the iPadOS 26 and (if you\u2019re brave enough) watchOS 26 betas.\nThe latest version of iOS will arrive officially this fall, but you don\u2019t need to wait to start testing the software on your iPhone, thanks to Apple\u2019s public beta rollout. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about setting up the iOS 26 beta, along with the respective betas for iPadOS 26 and watchOS 26, which Apple also revealed in its WWDC 2025 keynote.\nBefore we get started:, no, you haven\u2019t accidentally slept through eight versions of major Apple OS updates. In case you missed the news, from now on all of the company\u2019s various operating systems will be named after years to keep everything aligned and easy to follow. So rather than iOS 19, we\u2019re getting iOS 26 this year, which refers to the year after each update rolls out. Presumably that\u2019s because we\u2019ll be using it for longer in 2026 than what will remain of this year once the full version is in the wild.\nIt\u2019s also important to keep in mind that any beta is software in a pre-release state, meaning it's far more likely you\u2019ll encounter bugs, crashes and other issues with apps and in general use, which Apple and third-party developers will attempt to fix before the final version rolls out to users worldwide.\nInstall any beta at your own risk and think carefully before doing so with the device you use every day. It\u2019s also very important that you back up any device you want to test software on before you download it.\niOS 26 supported devices\niOS 26 is supported on a wide range of iPhones \u2014 but not all of them. You\u2019ll need one of the following models:\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\nIf your iPhone isn\u2019t listed above, that probably means it\u2019s too old to run iOS 26, so you\u2019ll need to upgrade to one of the listed models.\nHow to install the iOS 26 beta\nInstalling betas used to be a fiddly process, but it\u2019s very easy these days. If it\u2019s your first time installing an iOS public beta, you\u2019ll need to first visit the Apple Beta Software Program website and sign up using your Apple credentials.\nAfter that, navigate to Settings > General > Software Update on your compatible iPhone, and choose \u201ciOS 26 public beta\u201d. You should then see the option to download and install the beta software.\nYou can read about our first experiences with iOS 26 here.\niPadOS 26 supported devices\nHere are the supported models for the iPadOS 26 beta\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation or later)\niPad Pro 11-inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (M3)\niPad Air (M2)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later)\niPad (A16)\niPad (8th generation and later)\niPad Mini (A17 Pro)\niPad Mini (5th generation and later)\nHow to install the iPadOS 26 public beta\nLike with iOS above, you\u2019ll need to first visit the Apple Beta Software Program website and sign up using your Apple credentials if you\u2019ve never taken part in one before.\nAfter that, navigate to Settings > General > Software Update on your supported iPad, and choose \u201ciPadOS 26 public beta\u201d. You should then see the option to download and install the beta software in the Software Update screen.\nYou can read about our experiences with iPadOS 26 here.\nwatchOS beta: Use caution\nWhile Apple Watch users can also participate in beta programs in the same way as iOS and iPadOS testers, doing so carries greater risk. That\u2019s because if you\u2019re not enjoying the experience and decide you want to downgrade to watchOS 11, well, you can\u2019t. Apple doesn\u2019t allow it. And if you downgrade your watch\u2019s paired iPhone to iOS 18, your Apple Watch won\u2019t work correctly with your phone until it\u2019s back on the new software version. You can, however, leave your Apple Watch on watchOS 11 when your phone is on the iOS 26 beta.\nBe extremely sure, then, that you\u2019re comfortable with the possibility of waiting it out for a few months with an Apple Watch plagued with issues before downloading the watchOS 26 beta. For most people, it likely isn\u2019t worth the hassle.\nwatchOS 26 supported devices\nYou\u2019ll need one of these models to run the watchOS 26 beta\nApple Watch SE. (2nd generation)\nApple Watch Series 6\nApple Watch Series 7\nApple Watch Series 8\nApple Watch Series 9\nApple Watch Series 10\nApple Watch Ultra\nApple Watch Ultra 2\nHow to install the watchOS 26 public beta\nIf you've assessed the risks for your Apple Watch and still choose to install the watchOS 26 beta, you\u2019ll first need to have already updated your paired iPhone to the iOS 26 beta (see above).\nAfter that, make sure your Apple Watch is paired to your iOS 26-running iPhone and open the Watch app on your iPhone. Then, navigate to General > Software Update, and choose the watchOS 26 public beta. After doing that, you should be able to download the beta software."

      "text": "iOS 26 beta preview: Liquid Glass is better than you think\nApple\u2019s big design shift adjusts to fit reality.\nAt WWDC 2025, Apple revealed a major visual shake-up for iOS (not to mention the rest of the company\u2019s operating systems). This is the biggest change, aesthetically, since the shift away from the stitching, textures and skeuomorphic design of the iOS 4. It also comes with significantly fewer AI and Siri updates this time around. However, it\u2019s the smaller touches that make iOS 26 seem like a notable improvement over its predecessor.\nI\u2019ve been running the iOS 26 developer beta for the last two weeks and here's how Apple\u2019s new Liquid Glass design \u2014 and iOS 26 broadly \u2014 stacks up.\n(Ed. note: Apple just released the public betas for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 and watchOS 26. This means you can run the preview for yourself, if you are willing to risk potentially buggy or unstable software that could cause some of your apps to not work. As usual, we highly recommend backing up all your data before running any beta, and you can follow our guide on how to install Apple's public betas to do so.)\nLiquid Glass changes everything\niOS 26 looks new and modern. And for once, how Apple describes it \u2014 liquid glass \u2014 makes sense: it\u2019s a lot of layers of transparent elements overlapping and, in places, the animations are quite\u2026 liquidy. Menus and buttons will respond to your touch, with some of them coalescing around your finger and sometimes separating out into new menus.\nLiquid Glass encompasses the entire design of iOS. The home and lock screens have been redesigned once again, featuring a new skyscraping clock font that stretches out from the background of your photos, with ever-so-slight transparency. There\u2019s also a new 3D effect that infuses your photos with a bit of spatial magic, offering a touch of Vision Pro for iPhone users.\nThe experience in the first few builds of the iOS 26 beta was jarring and messy, especially with transparent icons and notifications, due to those overlapping elements making things almost illegible. Updates across subsequent releases have addressed this issue by making floating elements more opaque. There is also a toggle within the Accessibility tab in Settings to reduce transparency further, but I hope Apple offers a slider so that users can choose exactly how \u201cliquid\u201d they want their \u201cglass\u201d to be. If you own other Apple products, then you\u2019ll come to appreciate the design parity across your Mac, iPad and Apple Watch.\nOne noticeable change I'd been waiting for was the iOS search bar\u2019s relocation to the bottom of the screen. I first noticed it within Settings, but it reappears in Music, Podcasts, Photos and pretty much everywhere you might need to find specific files or menu items now. If, like me, you\u2019re an iPhone Pro or Plus user, you may have struggled to reach those search bars when they were at the top of the screen. It\u2019s a welcome improvement.\nVisual Intelligence\nWith iOS 26 on iPhones powerful enough to run Apple Intelligence, the company is bringing Visual Intelligence over to your screenshots. (Previously it was limited to Camera.) Once you\u2019ve grabbed a shot by pressing the power and volume up buttons, you\u2019ll get a preview of your image, surrounded by suggested actions that Apple Intelligence deduced would be relevant based on the contents of your screenshot.\nManaging Editor Cherlynn Low did a deep dive on what Visual Intelligence is capable of. From a screenshot, you can transfer information to other apps without having to switch or select them manually. This means I can easily screenshot tickets and emails, for example, to add to my calendar. Apple Intelligence can also identify types of plants, food and cars, even. If there are multiple people or objects in your screenshot, you can highlight what you want to focus on by circling it. There aren\u2019t many third-party app options at this point, but that\u2019s often the case with a beta build. These are features that Android users have had courtesy of Gemini for a year or two, but at least now we get something similar on iPhones.\nOne quick tip: Make sure to tap the markup button (the little pencil tip icon) to see Visual Intelligence in your screenshots. I initially thought my beta build was missing the feature, but it was just hidden behind the markup menu.\nMore broadly, Apple Intelligence continues to work well, but doesn't stand out in any particular way. We\u2019re still waiting for Siri to receive its promised upgrades. Still, iOS 26 appears to have improved the performance of many features that use the iPhone\u2019s onboard machine learning models. Since the first developer build, voice memos and voice notes are not only much faster, but also more accurate, especially with accents that the system previously struggled with.\nApple Intelligence\u2019s Writing tools \u2014 which I mainly use for summarizing meetings, conference calls and even lengthy PDFs \u2014 doesn't choke with more substantial reading. On iOS 18, it would struggle with voice notes longer than 10 minutes, trying to detangle or structure the contents of a meeting. I haven\u2019t had that issue with iOS 26 so far.\nGenmoji and Image Playground both offer up different results through the update. Image Playground can now generate pictures using ChatGPT. I\u2019ll be honest, I hadn\u2019t used the app since I tested it on iOS 18, but the upgrades mean it has more utility when I might want to generate AI artwork, which can occasionally reach photorealistic levels.\nOne useful addition is ChatGPT\u2019s \u201cany style\u201d option, meaning you can try to specify the style you have in mind, which can skirt a little closer to contentious mimicry \u2014 especially if you want, say, a frivolous image of you splashing in a puddle, Studio Ghibli style.\nApple also tweaked Genmoji to add deeper customization options, but these AI-generated avatars don\u2019t look like me? I liked the original Genmoji that launched last year, which had the almost-nostalgic style of 2010 emoji, but still somehow channeled the auras of me, my friends and family. This new batch are more detailed and elaborate, sure, but they don\u2019t look right. Also, they make me look bald. And contrary to my detractors, I am not bald. Yet. This feels like a direct attack, Apple.\nYou might feel differently, however. For example, Cherlynn said that the first version of Genmoji did not resemble her, frequently presenting her as someone with much darker skin or of a different ethnicity, regardless of the source picture she submitted.\nStill, the ability to change a Genmoji\u2019s expression, as well as add and remove glasses and facial hair through the new appearance customization options, is an improvement.\nA Camera app redesign for everyone\nApple has revisited the camera app, returning to basics by stripping away most of the previously offered modes and settings \u2014 at least initially \u2014 to display only video and photo modes.\nYou can swipe up from the bottom to see additional options, like flash, the timer, exposure, styles and more. You can also tap on the new six-dot icon in the upper right of the interface for the same options, though that requires a bit more of a reach. These behave in line with the new Liquid Glass design and you\u2019ll see the Photo pill expand into the settings menu when you press either area. Long-pressing on icons lets you go deeper into shooting modes, adjusting frame rates and even recording resolutions.\nWhat I like here is that it benefits casual smartphone photographers while keeping all the settings that more advanced users demand. None of the updates here are earth-shattering, though. I hope Apple takes a good look at what Adobe\u2019s Project Indigo camera app is doing \u2014 there are a lot of good ideas there.\nOne extra improvement if you use AirPods: Pressing and holding the stem of your AirPod (if it has an H2 chip) can now start video recording.\nApple Music tries to DJ\nAlongside the Liquid Glass design touches, the big addition to Apple Music this year is AutoMix. Like a (much) more advanced version of the crossfade feature found on most music streaming apps, in iOS 26, Music tries to mix between tracks, slowing or speeding up tempos, gently fading in drums or bass loops before the next song kicks in. Twenty percent of the time, it doesn\u2019t work well \u2014 or Apple Music doesn\u2019t even try. But the new ability to pin playlists and albums is useful, especially for recommendations from other folks that you never got around to listening to.\nMessages get a little more fun\nApple is making Messages more fun. One of the ways it\u2019s doing so is by enabling custom backgrounds in chats, much like in WhatsApp. I immediately set out to find the most embarrassing photo of my colleague (and frenemy) Cherlynn Low and make it our chat background. I know she\u2019s also running iOS 26 in beta, so she will see it. [Ed. note: Way to give me a reason to ignore your messages, Mat!]\nApple\u2019s Live translation now works across Messages, voice calls and FaceTime. Setting things up can be a little complicated \u2014 you\u2019ll first need to download various language files to use the feature. There\u2019s also some inconsistency in the languages supported across the board. For instance, Mandarin and Japanese are supported in Messages, but not on FaceTime yet. In chats, if your system language is set to English or Spanish, then you\u2019ll only be able to translate into English or Spanish. For those polyglots out there, if you want to translate incoming Japanese texts into German, you\u2019ll need to set your device's language to German.\nWhile I didn\u2019t get to flex my Japanese abilities on voice calls and FaceTime, iOS 26 was more than capable of keeping up with some rudimentary German and Spanish. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d rely on it for serious business translation or holiday bookings, but I think it could be a very useful tool for basics.\nThere\u2019s also the ability to filter spam messages to their own little folder (purgatory). Spam texts remain a nightmare, so I appreciate any potential weapons in the fight. Sadly, it hasn\u2019t quite manage to deal with the TikTok marketing agencies and phone network customer services that continue to barrage my Messages. Still, hopefully Apple will continue to improve its detection algorithms.\nOne more tool in the battle against spam: You can mute notifications for Messages from unknown numbers, although time-sensitive alerts from delivery services and rideshare apps will still reach you.\nNew apps are hit-or-miss\nNot everything in the beta lands, however. I\u2019ve already touched on how Liquid Glass was initially a semi-transparent mess. The Games App, too, seems like an unnecessary addition. Because it\u2019s a blend of the Games tab of the App Store and a silo of your preinstalled games, I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s adding. It\u2019s not any easier to navigate, nor does it introduce me to games I want to buy.\nCherlynn did want to highlight that for a casual gamer like herself, it\u2019s intriguing to see if the Games app might start to recommend more mind-numbing puzzles or farming simulations. She was also intrigued by the idea of a more social gaming experience on iOS, issuing challenges to her friends. Still, because the phone she has been testing the beta on doesn\u2019t have access to all her contacts or her gaming history, the recommendations and features are fairly limited at the moment.\nGames is one of two new apps that will automatically join your home screen. (Fortunately, they can be uninstalled). The other is Preview, which should be a familiar addition to any Mac user. It offers an easy way to view sent or downloaded files, like menus, ticket QR codes and more. During the developer beta, the app pulled in a handful of my documents that previously lived in the Files app. Navigation across both those apps is identical, although Preview is limited to files you can actually open, of course.\nAirPods, upgraded\nThis is more iPhone-adjacent, but iOS 26 includes several quality-of-life improvements for some of Apple\u2019s headphones. First up: notifications when your AirPods are fully charged, finally! The Apple Watch got this kind of notification back in iOS 14, so it\u2019s great to see Apple\u2019s headphones catch up.\nApple is also promising \u201cstudio-quality sound recording\u201d from the AirPods, augmenting recordings with computational audio improvements. There\u2019s a noticable bump in audio quality. It appears that AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 will record files at a sample rate of 48 kHz, which is double the rate used in the past. The sample rate bump happened last year, but it is dependent on what the app you're using. Is it \u201cstudio quality\u201d? I don\u2019t think so, but it\u2019s an improvement. While recordings sound slightly better in quiet locations, the bigger change is in loud environments. The algorithm doesn't appear to be degrading audio quality as much while trying to reduce background noise.\niOS 26 also adds sleep detection to the buds. If the AirPods detect minimal movement, they\u2019ll switch off automatically, which could be helpful for the next time I\u2019m flying long-haul.\nWrap-up\nIn iOS 26, Apple has prioritized design changes and systemwide consistency over AI-centric software and features. While Liquid Glass is a big change to how your iPhone looks, Apple has drawn from user feedback to finesse the design into feeling less jarring and gelling better when the home screen, Control Center and Notification drop-downs overlap with each other.\nThere are numerous quality of life improvements, including Messages and Visual Intelligence, in particular. If anything, the AI elephant in the room is the lack of any substantial updates on Siri. After the company talked up advanced Siri interactions over a year ago, I\u2019m still waiting for its assistant to catch up with the likes of Google."

      "text": "Apple reportedly has a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT in the works\nBloomberg reports that Apple has a dedicated team to create an in-house chatbot and search experience.\nApple has fallen far behind in the competitive market of AI-powered chatbots, but it may have a plan for an in-house option that aligns with the company's \"not first, but best\" philosophy. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple created a team called \"Answers, Knowledge and Information\" earlier this year that's tasked with developing a \"stripped-down rival to ChatGPT.\"\nForming this team represents a major change in direction from Apple's earlier stance on artificial intelligence when the company partnered with OpenAI in 2024 to infuse Siri with ChatGPT instead of developing its own AI chatbot. Now, Gurman reported that this new Apple team will instead develop in-house AI services for a \"new ChatGPT-like search experience\" that can crawl the web to respond to questions. These new capabilities could be a standalone app, as well as support AI capabilities for Apple's Siri, Spotlight and Safari, according to Gurman's sources. The team is reportedly led by Robby Walker, who previously oversaw Siri, and has been advertising job openings that mention wanting experience with search algorithms and engine development.\nBeyond the Answers, Knowledge and Information team, Apple has experienced some growing pains when it comes to artificial intelligence. Earlier this year, the company said it would delay the release of the new-and-improved Siri, adding only that it would roll out \"in the coming year.\" However, Apple is aware of the need to accelerate its Apple Intelligence program to stay competitive. In the latest third-quarter earnings call, the company's CEO Tim Cook said that Apple is open to acquisitions to fast-track its AI roadmap."

      "text": "WWDC 2025: iOS 26, new Liquid Glass design and everything else Apple announced\nApple revealed a bunch of changes coming to iOS, iPadOS and macOS later this year; here's what you need to know.\nApple's WWDC 2025 keynote gave fans a good look into what their iPhones, iPads and Mac computers will look like come this fall when the new software updates come out. Key to the changes is Apple's new Liquid Glass design language, which will bring UI tweaks to all of its operating systems later this year. The redesign focuses on streamlining things and boosting productivity while giving most elements a semi-translucent look. As to be expected Apple Intelligence features are baked into all of the forthcoming software updates, and users can expect to see updated widgets, a few overhauled apps and more. Here's everything Apple announced at WWDC 2025 this year.\nLiquid Glass design and new software names\nAs was expected, Apple revealed a new visual design language coming to all of its operating systems dubbed Liquid Glass. It called this new system its \"broadest\" design update yet, and it features semi-translucent features like redesigned widgets, notifications and more. Apple is billing it as more dynamic than the previous design language, and a way to bring even more consistency across all operating systems including iOS, iPadOS and macOS.\nIn addition to the redesign, Apple is revamping the names of all of its operating systems. Instead of iOS 19, for example, we\u2019ll have iOS 26 coming out this fall. iPadOS 26, watchOS 26 and others will follow suit, marking the first time Apple has given its software updates year identifiers instead of arbitrary generation numbers.\niOS 26\nThe changes coming to iOS 26 are subtle, but they give it a clean look and feel, with lots of overlapping elements, rounded corners and more. Apple said the design is inspired by visionOS, the operating system that powers Vision Pro headsets. App icons have a slightly different look, while toolbars and text inputs have see-through appearances. Folks will be happy to know that things are largely the same \u2014 you shouldn't have an issue identifying key apps like the Phone, Messages or FaceTime.\nPhone app\nSpeaking of the Phone app, it's getting the biggest redesign since its launch with the original iPhone all those years ago. It puts scrolling front and center, allowing you to scroll through key contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. A translucent bar at the bottom of the screen gives you quick access to additional contacts and the keypad. Hold Assist, a new feature, will mute hold music but keep you on a call until someone picks up on the other line.\nMessages\nMessages is getting a few new features as well, including the ability to change the entire message background color for group messages and polls among group chat members. New screening features includes \"unknown senders,\" which sequesters those pesky spam messages to a separate space in Messages, so you can keep your most important conversations in the forefront and ignore those that don't matter.\nApple Intelligence features are spread throughout all of the software updates, and in Messages, there are some related to Genmoji. In iOS 26, you'll be able to combine two existing emoji to create an entirely new, custom Genmoji, and you can even use ChatGPT to create Genmoji as well.\nLive translate is coming to Messages, too, automatically translating messages as you type and delivering them to the receiver in their preferred language. Similarly functioning live captions will be available in FaceTime, and Apple Music will get live translation and live pronunciation features to help listeners enjoy music in other languages. The Call Translation API will be available to third-party developers to use in their communication apps as well.\nMaps and Wallet\nApple Maps will gain the ability to learn your routine and suggest alternative routes based on traffic. It will also log your \"visited places\": cities, landmarks and business that you've been to, making it easier for you to find places you want to revisit again.\nSeparately, the Wallet app will support Digital ID, which lets you create a digital ID that's different from your driver's license and passport and can be used to verify your identity in some locations. You'll also be able to add updated boarding passes to Wallet when you're flying.\nGames app\niOS 26 will feature a dedicated Games app as well. It will feature a Library tab, where you can find all of the games you've ever downloaded for iOS, and a dedicated Apple Arcade tab for all of the titles included in that service. Challenges is a new feature will let you compete against friends in supported games, including supported single-player games that developers.\nVisual Intelligence\nVisual Intelligence is getting baked into iOS 26's interface a bit more, allowing you to visually search for anything that pops up on your iPhone screen. For example, if there's an image of a jacket you like on your social media feed, you can take a screenshot and use the new Visual Intelligence image search feature to search for similar jackets across the web and other apps. You can highlight certain areas of your screenshot to refine the search further.\nwatchOS 26\nIn addition to the Liquid-Glass visual overhaul, watchOS 26 will bring Workout Buddy to your wrist. The new feature will analyze your fitness history and identify insights in real time as you're working out. It takes shape as a sort of audio coach that can inform you of things like the distance you've run, average pacing and those compares to previous runs you've completed. New Apple Music integration can choose playlists for you as well, based on the type of workout you're doing.\nSmart Stack on Apple Watch is getting an update as well, prioritizing the information that matters most to you depending on your routine. For example, when you walk into your gym, a Smart Stack hint will appear on your watch that will quickly take you to the workout app so you can dive right into your training session.\nmacOS Tahoe\nThe next version of Apple's desktop operating system is dubbed macOS Tahoe, keeping the classic California naming scheme the company has been using for a long time. Liquid Glass design language is at the forefront here, but long-time Mac users will find most things look quite familiar, just with a semi-translucent, rounded edge now. Users will have the option to make custom backgrounds, change the color of their desktop folders and even add emoji to them.\niOS' Phone app will be available on macOS Tahoe, improving the calling capabilities of Mac computers. With it, you can more easily access your contacts and voicemail messages, and it will support all of the new features the new Phone app in iOS 26 will, including things like Hold Assist.\nIntelligent actions are coming to the Shortcuts app, which integrates Apple Intelligence into the existing Shortcuts program. This lets you access Apple Intelligence models on-device, creating your own Shortcuts with AI capabilities. In a similar vein, Spotlight will be more powerful in macOS Tahoe, allowing you to call upon and execute multi-step Shortcuts and actions directly from Spotlight search, without navigating to other apps. You can also use Spotlight to access your clipboard history in the latest software update, too.\niPadOS 26\niPadOS 26 will feature a Liquid Glass redesign along with most of the new features detailed for iOS 26, including the revamped Phone and Games apps. Unique for the iPad, though, is a new menu bar and windowing feature that makes the tablet's UI look and feel a lot more like macOS. That means it should improve multitasking, something iPad power-users have wanted for a long time. You can resize windows, snap them to different corners or swipe them away temporarily to get a glimpse of your home screen. Apple claims the window system is designed to work just as well with touch input (either via fingers or a stylus) or trackpads on compatible accessories.\nThe Files app on iPad will feature an updated list view and the same custom color options you'll find on the new macOS Tahoe. You'll also be able to choose which programs or apps you want to open certain files, so for example, you can opt to open an image in Photoshop rather than the default option. Speaking of, a new Preview app is coming to iPads in the new software update. A mainstay on macOS, this app will bring native PDF management, annotation and editing to Apple's tablets.\niPadOS 26 will bring a number of new features for podcasters and the like, including the ability to record \"studio quality\" vocals with AirPods. Users will also be able to press and hold their AirPods to start and stop the recordings they're making on their iPads. In addition, a new local capture feature will integrate with video conferencing apps to let users record their video on iPads for things like remote group podcasts.\nvisionOS 26\nThe next software update coming to Vision Pro systems will include new Apple Intelligence features, spatial experiences and more. Spatial widgets are coming to visionOS 26, allowing you to put, say, a calendar widget somewhere in your Vision Pro field of view and it will stay in that place even as you move around. Native and third-party apps can support spatial widgets, and they'll all be available in the new Widgets visionOS app.\nSpatial scenes is a new feature that uses AI to bring your photos to life in front of your eyes while using Vision Pro. Spatial scenes also extend to photos you'll see while browsing, so for example, those travel photos you see while researching your next vacation will look even more lifelike using spatial scenes.\nArguably the most exciting visionOS news is that it will allow the Vision Pro headset to be used with PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers. This will make Vision Pro more of a contender in the gaming space, since lack of compatible controllers was a big factor holding it back. In addition, the new software update will bring eye-scrolling to the Vision Pro, which will allow users to scroll documents, apps, webpages and more just by using their eyes.\ntvOS 26\nThe new Liquid Glass design language brings more cinematic film and TV art to the Apple TV app in tvOS 26. A new Profiles feature in Apple TV+ lets you customize your viewing experience with your own tastes, and each member of your household can have their own profile. Elsewhere, Apple Music on Apple TV is getting a karaoke-esque feature that lets you sing along to your favorite songs using your iPhone as the microphone."

      "text": "iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 public beta: Everything you need to know about the new Apple updates\nExciting changes are coming to your iPhone this fall, including a new aesthetic called Liquid Glass.\nIn just over a month, we'll finally get to download the official iOS 26 on our iPhones. Available now is the iOS 26 developer beta 6 (for developers only), and the public beta which you can download and install now. CEO Tim Cook recently said it's (along with the other current beta operating systems) \"by far the most popular developer betas we\u2019ve had,\" 9to5Mac reports. You can also take a look at our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant \u2014 first promised at WWDC 2024 \u2014 is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.\nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it \u2014 version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead.\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year \u2014 the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some \u2014 including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar \u2014 like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.\nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options.\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheckout our first impressions of iPadOS 26.\nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS \u2014 iPhone XR, XS and XS Max \u2014 won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September.\nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address.

      "text": "iPhone 17 release is rumored for September: Everything you need to know about the 'thinnest iPhone ever' and the Apple fall event\nHere are all the iPhone 17 rumors and leaks leading up to the fall announcement.\nThe closer we get to Apple's reveal of the iPhone 17 lineup, the more excited we are to see what's different from the previous iPhones. The newest smartphones will come equipped with the latest iOS 26 features. Since we still have to wait at least a month (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors and reports?\nWill the iPhone 17 Pro have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design? That's the implication from Majin Bu, whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker.\" The individual posted a render on X today (see below) that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump.\nAgain, this is a render, not a real-world photo, and \u2014 like all such stories ahead of the official announcement \u2014 should be treated with the usual grain of salt. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers?\nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 \u2014 but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick \u2014 half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-langauge Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well.\nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE.\nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 \u2014 likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson \u2014 a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information \u2014 showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups \u2014 not real, leaked iPhones \u2014 it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm.\nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story."

      "text": "Apple's new Liquid Glass design is its biggest visual update in years\nIt's bringing the slick UI elements used in the Vision Pro to iPhones, iPads, Macs and more.\nIn addition to renaming its core operating systems, today at WWDC Apple announced a major update to the visual design of iOS, iPadOS, macOS and more. Inspired by some of the fancy graphics used in the Vision Pro, this UI overhaul not only features revamped icons and an emphasis on translucent elements, it also seeks to bring a much more unified look to Apple's flagship software platforms.\nBased on a design theme called Liquid Glass, Apple's new visual language brings increased consistency across the company's OSes. The company says the UI is informed by surrounding content and can intelligently adapt to light and dark modes while supporting sophisticated traits like real-time rendering and specular highlights.\nNavigation buttons, toolbars and controls have been redesigned to match the rounded corners of the iPhone's display and can shrink to keep relevant content front and center. Apple uses multiple layers of Liquid Glass to help people see more information at a glance without making them relearn how to use the OS.\nIn iOS 26, the home screen has been completely revamped with new app icons (including fresh all-clear options). Wallpapers and the lock screen can dynamically scale to better accommodate things like photos, album art and on-screen text. Many buttons also have a new floating design that makes them easier to see without becoming distracting or taking away from usable screen space.\nSome important apps have also gotten individual makeovers such as the Phone app, which now has a floating toolbar alongside new features such as Call Screening and Hold Assist, which are similar to the AI-powered tools available from Google's Pixel handsets.\nMeanwhile, the Camera app's interface has been significantly simplified with the ability to quickly swipe between photo and video modes. There's also a dedicated tab for your library and improved organization for other categories like albums. In iPadOS and macOS, Apple says that adaptive sidebars also makes watching shows in Apple TV more immersive.\nIn macOS 26 Tahoe, users will be able to customize the desktop and dock with updated Liquid Glass widgets and icons while new transparent menu bars are meant to make your display seem even larger than it is. You'll also have more customization options in places like the Control Center thanks to a new selection of folder colors, app icons and widgets. There's even a brand new Apple Games app, which features an overlay and the ability to quickly launch games, discover new titles and find your friends, all from a single place.\nSimilar UI updates are also heading to CarPlay and CarPlay Ultra, which is getting a matching visual refresh featuring a revamped home screen, widgets for things like Live Activities and translucent design elements. Users can set new \"tapback\" responses so you can reply to incoming messages with a single touch.\nAlternatively, if there's someone you regularly talk to while driving, you'll also be able to pin favorite conversations in CarPlay similar to how it works in Messages. And in keeping with Apple's goal of making more information available at a glance, incoming calls will no longer dominate the entire display and instead will be confined to a small window.\nAll of Apple's redesigned Liquid Glass UI elements and features are expected to be available when the next versions of iOS, macOS, iPadOS and more are officially released sometime later this year."

      "text": "Apple is delaying its smarter, more personal Siri\nThe feature is taking longer to complete than expected.\nApple is delaying its updated version of Siri that understands personal context and can take action inside of apps, according to a statement the company shared with Daring Fireball.\nThe company didn't offer a date as to when the upgrades to Siri will actually launch beyond that they're \"rolling them out in the coming year.\" Here's the full statement reproduced below:\nSiri helps our users find what they need and get things done quickly, and in just the past six months, we\u2019ve made Siri more conversational, introduced new features like type to Siri and product knowledge, and added an integration with ChatGPT. We\u2019ve also been working on a more personalized Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps. It\u2019s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.\nA revamped, more powerful Siri was a core part of Apple's original pitch for Apple Intelligence. Way back when the company first detailed its plans, it claimed that Siri would not only understand what's happening on your phone, but also be able to take action in apps for you. So far, the main pieces of that new Siri Apple has shipped are the ability to type requests rather than speak them out loud, the ability to understand and explain Apple product features, a new animation for when Siri is activated and integration with ChatGPT.\nBloomberg was the first to report that the updated Siri was facing problems and potential delays. Apple's plans to connect Siri to a large language model that would give the assistant even more capabilities is also reportedly years away."
