  "description": "The book adaptation of the mystery series comes to Netflix, and Peacock airs the \u201cLove Island USA\u201d reunion.",
  "content": "Between streaming and cable, there is a seemingly endless variety of things to watch. Here is a selection of TV shows and specials that are airing or streaming this week, Aug. 25-31. Details and times are subject to change.\n\nOn Aug. 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Gulf Coast, leading to breaches in New Orleans flood prevention; 80 percent of the city was submerged in water. The cost of the damage from the hurricane was $125 billion, and though it\u2019s been difficult to get an accurate death toll, it is estimated to be about 1,800.\n\nIn 2006, Spike Lee directed the documentary \u201cWhen the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts,\u201d which detailed, straight from mouths of New Orleans residents, the preparation, crisis and aftermath, and now he is back as an executive producer of a new three-part series \u201cKatrina: Come Hell and High Water.\u201d In his first documentary, many residents were still in the throes of the tragedy, but now Lee is giving people a chance to reflect on the past 20 years. Lee directed one of the episodes \u2014 Geeta Gandbhir and Samantha Knowles directed the others. Streaming Wednesday on Netflix.",
