  "description": "San Francisco's third baseman missed nearly a month earlier this season with a badly sprained hand.",
  "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Matt Chapman returned from a badly sprained hand on July 5, he acknowledged that the injury hadn\u2019t fully healed and that he expected to play through discomfort for the remainder of the season.\n\nSix weeks later, it\u2019s possible that Chapman\u2019s season has come to an abbreviated end. The San Francisco Giants placed their Gold Glove third baseman on the 10-day injured list on Friday and sent him for an MRI exam. Results weren\u2019t immediately available, but with the Giants rapidly playing their way into irrelevance this season, it won\u2019t make much sense to rush back an important core player who is under contract for five more seasons.\n\n\u201cLook, he\u2019s a pretty tough guy,\u201d Giants manager Bob Melvin said. \u201cDuring the course of the season, you\u2019re gonna play through some stuff. I think some days (were) probably worse than others. We\u2019ve got to the point where we needed to take a look at it.\u201d\n\nPrior to taking Wednesday off, Chapman had started 31 consecutive games \u2014 and played all but three of the team\u2019s defensive innings at third base \u2014 after returning from his initial IL stint. The 32-year-old infielder acknowledged he had to grind a little harder in recent weeks. Not surprisingly, it\u2019s been a struggle for him in August. He is hitting .162 with one extra-base hit in 45 plate appearances over 11 games.\n\nThe Giants started Casey Schmitt at third base Friday as they begin a home series with the Tampa Bay Rays. They\u2019ve lost 13 of 14 home games since July 12, which hadn\u2019t happened in a single season since 1940. They are scoring 1.8 runs per game over that span and hitting .146 with runners in scoring position. Schmitt is a rare exception. He\u2019s batting .308 this month with three doubles and two home runs. Now he\u2019ll shift over from second base to play his natural position. The Giants started Christian Koss at second base on Friday but could take another look at Tyler Fitzgerald at the position.\n\nThe Giants are likely to give more rest to other core players down the stretch, too. But Melvin didn\u2019t want to give a day off to center fielder Jung Hoo Lee, who was looking forward to playing against his friend and former Kiwoom Heroes teammate Ha-Seong Kim.\n\nThe Giants also placed right-hander Ryan Walker on the paternity list and replaced him with right-hander Keaton Winn, who\u2019s had a season marred by injuries but is coming off consecutive scoreless innings while pitching out of the bullpen for Triple-A Sacramento. Right-hander Landen Roupp (elbow inflammation) returned from his rehab assignment and will start on Friday.",
