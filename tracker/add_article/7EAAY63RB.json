      "summary": "SpaceX is contesting Virginia's plan to deploy fiber Internet, arguing that federal grant money should favor Starlink instead. The company is seeking $60 million in funding, claiming that Virginia's proposal represents a waste of taxpayer money by prioritizing fiber over satellite technology. The Trump administration's recent changes to the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program support SpaceX's position, advocating for a tech-neutral approach that could benefit satellite providers like Starlink.",
