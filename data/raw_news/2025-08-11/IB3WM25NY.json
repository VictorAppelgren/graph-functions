  "title": "The tablet that replaced my iPad and Kindle got a worthy successor - and I'm loving the upgrades",
  "description": "The TCL Nxtpaper 11 Plus is a well-rounded Android tablet that offers a solid everyday experience at a competitive price.",
  "content": "I test a lot of tablets, and admittedly, the design aspirations of many of these devices has gotten complacent. It's hard to get excited about a new tablet because most of its features have already been available before. It's rare to come across a truly innovative tablet that offers something new to consumers.\n\nAlso: I found an E Ink tablet worthy of replacing my Remarkable, and it's on sale\n\nI already loved the previous model of this tablet, the 10-inch Nxtpaper 10, but it was a Verizon exclusive that you couldn't easily buy elsewhere. The new Nxtpaper 11 Plus is an even better variation of one of my favorite tablets, and it's available at Walmart for $249.\n\nIn addition to using the tablet's Nxtpaper technology to switch from a full-color display to an ink-paper display, this tablet has 256GB of internal storage, an 11.5-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and expandable 8GB of RAM.\n\nAlso: This 8-inch gaming tablet is the ultimate plane entertainment device (and on sale)\n\nIt's strong enough to serve as an entertainment and light-work tablet for most users, but it's also perfect for replacing or doubling as an e-reader.\n\nThe last time I tested a TCL Nxtpaper tablet, I literally gave my husband my iPad, realizing I no longer needed it. I also gave my kid my Kindle on the same day -- that's how well this tablet performed. So when I tell you that I was giddy with excitement to try the new Nxtpaper 11 Plus, I'm not exaggerating.\n\nThis time, the Nxtpaper 11 Plus also delivered on my expectations. Immediately upon trying it, I could see how the interface had improved. The display is beautiful and matte, perfect for use with a stylus if you'd like to purchase one separately. And you can now switch to color paper or ink paper modes by pressing a shortcut button along the edge of the tablet instead of selecting an option in the dropdown menu.\n\nAlso: This Windows 11 tablet for field research is about as durable as a tablet can be\n\nThe display on the TCL Nxtpaper 11 Plus features Nxtpaper 4.0, an upgrade from the company's older Nxtpaper 2.0 in the previous model. The vibrancy and clarity of the new display leap above the previous tablet, which didn't look very crisp in its full color mode, especially when watching videos.\n\nThe only drawback to using the TCL Nxtpaper 11 Plus as an e-reader is that it's not a light device. At 17.3 ounces (just over one pound), the tablet can feel heavy after some time reading unless you prop it up or use a case for it. I got a hand strap so I can read more easily with the Nxtpaper 11 Plus, and it ended up being a perfect solution.\n\nPerformance-wise, the TCL Nxtpaper 11 Plus is snappy and surprisingly reliable for such an inexpensive Android tablet, though I also found this to be the case with the previous model. It's not overloaded with bloatware upon setup, and the apps don't randomly crash like they do with other Android tablets I've tested.\n\nAlso: Best note-taking tablets 2025: My hand-picked options for writing notes\n\nOne of the big promises that TCL makes with the Nxtpaper 11 Plus is reducing eye strain by filtering 61% more blue light than traditional tablets. You can also set Reading Modes and enable Adaptive Brightness to further reduce the chance of eye fatigue.\n\nI use my MacBook Pro and iPad every day for work, so I found a big difference when using the TCL Nxtpaper 11 Plus instead of my iPad each night. By the end of the night, my eyes weren't straining or exhausted, and my tension headaches even became milder, which is a big plus.\n\nMore than anything, I loved that I could switch modes from regular full-color to ink paper when I was ready to start reading as part of my bedtime ritual, instead of putting my tablet away to grab my Kindle.\n\nIf you're in the market for a great entertainment tablet that can double as an e-reader, you can't go wrong with the TCL Nxtpaper 11 Plus. I love that I can use this tablet like I do my Kindle e-reader, especially because you get the fast experience of a regular tablet and the versatility of using any platform to read, not just Kindle.\n\nAlso: I replaced my Kindle with an iPad Mini as my ebook reader - 8 reasons why I don't regret it\n\nThis tablet is truly worth every penny, thanks to its great performance and ease of use. It's not a buggy device whatsoever, like you often see with affordable Android tablets. It promises to be an entertainment tablet that's easy on your eyes, and it delivers on every promise.",

Though I enjoy the feel and texture of a good, old-fashioned printed book, I typically turn to ebooks because they're easier on the eyes. And what do I use as a reader? No, not a Kindle, but my trusty iPad mini.\nAlso: I finally found a tablet that can easily replace my iPad and Kindle (and is affordably priced)\nI've tried a couple of Kindles in the past, but didn't quite take to them. For me, the iPad mini is a more versatile device that offers certain advantages over a Kindle. First, though, I'm going to discuss the ways in which the Kindle beats an iPad mini. Yep, I'm playing devil's advocate to start.\n4 ways Kindle beats iPad mini for reading\nTo start, there's the price. Kindles come in different sizes, formats, and price tags. But even the most expensive Kindle, the 64GB Kindle Scribe, retails for $449. Other models are considerably less, starting with the Kindle Basic at $110. Compare that with the latest iPad mini 7th generation, which starts at $489.\nThen there's the display. Kindles use e-ink technology to deliver a crisp, sharp look that suits longer reading sessions. In contrast, the iPad mini sports a traditional LCD screen, which looks great but could strain the eyes after a while.\nAlso: Should you buy a refurbished iPad? I tried one from Back Market and here's my verdict\nAnother item in the Kindle's favor is size and weight. The basic Kindle with a 6-inch screen measures 6.2\"\u00d74.3\"\u00d70.32\", while the Kindle Paperwhite and Colorsoft with 7-inch screens both measure 7\"\u00d75\"\u00d70.3\". Due to their diminutive size, you can hold these Kindles in one hand and turn the page with the other, and they're relatively light.\nIn contrast, an iPad mini measures 7.69\"\u00d75.3\"\u00d70.25\". That's a bit more difficult to hold in one hand, especially if you have short fingers. The iPad is also heavier than a Kindle. However, I solved both the size and weight issues by attaching a cellphone grip to the back of my iPad mini. I can easily hold it with the third and fourth fingers of either hand and turn the page with the thumb of the same hand.\nFinally, battery life is another point for the Kindle. On a single charge, a Kindle can last for days, even weeks. The iPad mini lasts around 10 hours on a single charge.\nAlso: This simple Kindle accessory has seriously upgraded my reading experience - and it's cheap\nOK, those are definitely features that give the nod to the Kindle. Why do I still prefer an iPad mini for reading my favorite books? Read on.\n8 ways iPad mini beats Kindle\n1. Display size\nThe less expensive Kindles sport a 6-inch or 7-inch screen size, while the iPad mini boasts a screen size of 8.3 inches. I've always found the screen on the Kindle too small, especially since the bezels are large. For me, the iPad mini's screen delivers more bang for the buck, given its bigger real estate.\n2. Resolution\nThe Kindle offers a sharp display with e-ink technology, but the resolution is another story. The resolution on all Kindle models, including the latest Kindle Basic, is 300 ppi (pixels per inch). The full resolution on the 6-inch and 7-inch Kindles varies based on model and size but ranges from 1,072\u00d71,448 pixels for the Kindle Basic to 1,264\u00d71,680 pixels for the Kindle Colorsoft.\nAlso: This midrange Lenovo tablet has no business being this good (especially for traveling)\nThe iPad mini's resolution is 2,266\u00d71,488 at 326 ppi. For me, the iPad's higher resolution compensates for its LCD screen, resulting in sharp text and sharper images.\n3. Color vs. B&W\nMost Kindles use a black-and-white display. The Kindle Colorsoft is the exception. Though the text resolution on the Colorsoft is 300 ppi, the color resolution is 150 ppi. With the iPad mini's overall resolution of 326 ppi, such content as images, PDFs, and comic books look much better.\n4. Responsiveness\nThough Amazon has improved the responsiveness of the Kindle over the years, the iPad mini is still the winner here. Swiping or tapping from one page to another on a Kindle -- or pressing a button or control -- can be slow and even jerky at times. With its more powerful processor, the iPad mini is faster and smoother when moving from one page to another or accessing different controls.\nAlso: I tested the Kindle most people should buy. Here's why it's the best e-reader out of the lineup\n5. Controls\nI've never liked the way you control a Kindle. Tapping the screen moves you to the next page. To access key settings, you have to swipe down from the top of the screen. Viewing the page timeline and slider requires you to swipe up from the bottom. To view other settings or return to your library, you have to tap at the top in just the right spot. Yes, you can pinch the screen to zoom in and out, but that's about the only familiar aspect.\nAlso: Want free ebooks? These 10 sites offer thousands of options\nControlling an iPad mini is much more intuitive. Beyond pinching the screen to zoom in and out, simply tapping it displays all the available settings and controls.\n6. Greater capacity\nThe newest iPad mini starts with 128GB of storage and shoots up to as much as 512GB. The Kindle maxes out at 64GB. The comparison may not be fair, as the iPad mini is home to a variety of content, while the Kindle houses just ebooks. Still, you can squeeze a lot more books on the iPad than the Kindle.\nAlso: The 5 best iPads of 2025: We've tested every iPad on the market - these are the best ones\n7. Access to other ebook services\nThe iPad mini grants you access to a variety of book apps and services, including Amazon Kindle, Apple Books, Kobo Books, B&N Nook, and Google Play Books. You can also borrow ebooks from your local library via Libby, Hoopla, and other apps. On a Kindle device, you can\u2019t directly use any book service other than Amazon\u2019s Kindle. In some cases, you may be able to sideload certain apps, but the process is challenging.\n8. Versatility\nA Kindle has one job and one job only -- an ebook reader. The Kindle does come with a web browser, but its functionality is limited. As a tablet, the iPad mini brings you a world of apps, services, and content.\nAlso: The best iPads for college: Expert tested and reviewed\nBottom line\nThe Kindle is certainly an effective device for reading ebooks. But I still prefer the iPad mini for the reasons I mentioned here. For me, Apple's tablet is not only a more versatile device but works well as an ebook reader. With both an iPad mini and Kindle on my nightstand, I invariably reach for the iPad when I want to read a good book before bedtime.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

I'm pretty familiar with the Stealth line, having reviewed several models in the past. This version doesn't reinvent the wheel. In fact, it shares many similarities with its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI+, to its benefit and to a fault.\nAlso: The best laptops for graphic designers: Expert tested\nFirst off: on the surface, I genuinely can't tell the difference between this model and the previous generation. The Stealth 16 measures 14\"x 10.22\"x 0.85\" inches -- the exact same dimensions as the A16. It even weighs the same at 4.63 pounds.\nWhat's funny is I used to think that was really heavy, but after carrying around chunky laptops, MSI's device feels lightweight. Even with the power adapter, I didn't mind carrying it around town. By the way, I factor that adapter into the overall weight because you will need it on hand. More on that later.\nBringing back the classics\nA few other great design elements make their triumphant return. Going down the list, you have a full-size gaming keyboard. Each button has a 1.5mm travel distance, ensuring a comfortable typing feel. Six surround sound speakers are located at either end below the keyboard for immersive audio.\nOne of my favorite moments testing this laptop came from listening to \"Doomsday\" by MF Doom. The lyrical flow from Doom sounded crystal clear and powerful through the laptop's speakers, filling my entire room with his supervillainy.\nAbove the keyboard is the 16-inch OLED display. At QuadHD+ (2,560 x 1,600 pixels) resolution, it's not quite 4K, but it's close enough -- the screen still delivers impressive visual output. Colors are vibrant, the high resolution delivers detailed images, and the 240Hz refresh rate ensures smooth on-screen motion.\nPower boost\nOne of my favorite things about MSI laptops is how easy it is to tweak their performance. On many Windows 11 laptops, all you can really do is change the Power mode in the Settings, but MSI Center, its internal settings program is actually pretty robust. Here, you can adjust the computer's output on the fly. For example, enabling Extreme Performance and Discrete Graphics Mode delivers the best hardware results.\nAlso: I tested Dell's XPS successor, and it beat my $3,000 Windows laptop in almost every way\nInside my review unit was an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card, and 32GB of RAM. It's a pretty good configuration, if I say so myself, and it shows in the performance numbers.\nBelow is a list comparing MSI's Stealth 16 with its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI Plus, and the Dell Premium 16. You'll notice that the newer model has better raw processing and rendering power than the others, indicating it excels at handling heavy workloads and rendering complex 3D graphics.\nThere is a bit of a gap between the Stealth 16 and the A16 on PCMark 10, suggesting that the older model has better general performance; it's able to hop between web pages and apps without much issue. However, I didn't experience any slowdown. This laptop ran great everywhere.\nPCMark 10 | Geekbench 6 | Cinebench 2024 | Cinebench R23 | |\nMSI Stealth 16 AI | 7,693 | 15,883 | 1,129 | 21,656 |\nMSI Stealth A16 AI+ | 7,913 | 14,196 | N/A | 18,336 |\nDell Premium 16 | 6,865 | 14,763 | 726 | 17,522 |\nHaving Dell's machine may seem random, but you need to understand that the Stealth 16 isn't just a solid gaming computer. It's also a powerful graphic design laptop, too. For testing, I installed Blender, a free 3D creation app, and edited images on Pixlr. I'm not much of an artist, but I did manage to create and render simple scenes starring Blender's complex monkey model.\nI had a similar experience with Pixlr, as I was able to edit 4K photographs without any major hiccups. The entire process went smoothly. MSI's laptop is a powerhouse in almost every sense of the word.\nAlso: I switched to the Dell 14 Premium for a week, and it makes even the XPS feel outdated\nAs powerful as the laptop may be, it has its limits. I ran multiple 4K YouTube livestreams as part of my usual 50-tab Chrome browser test. Everything ran fine when there were only three livestreams, although once I hit six, I noticed a slowdown. Livestreams were slow to load. It took a few seconds before the Stealth 16 could play the video as normal.\nStaying cool\nHeavy workloads do cause the Stealth 16 to heat up a bit, but high temperatures were never an issue. Heat vents are strategically placed above the keyboard, on the side of the laptop, and on the bottom, so your hands are never at risk of touching a hot keyboard. In fact, the keys stayed nice and cool the entire time. Unfortunately, this means you can't place the computer on your lap; otherwise, your legs will be blasted by hot air.\nThis ability to stay cool under duress is thanks to the Cooler Boost 5 cooling system, which consists of two large fans and five heat pipes directing hot air out through the vents. This system is also on the vastly more powerful MSI Raider 18 HX.\nUnsurprisingly, MSI's Stealth 16 is not designed to be away from its charger for long. You can push its endurance by enabling ECO-Silent and Integrated Graphics Mode in the MSI Center app, and Best Power Efficiency in Windows, but even then, it will last around six hours on a single charge, depending on what you're doing.\nLike many gaming laptops with this kind of hardware, it may have power, but it lacks in stamina. For that reason, I'd suggest this for users who don't need an all-day battery kind of laptop, but are fine with a few hour stints throughout the day.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe MSI Stealth 16 AI is on sale at Best Buy for $2,030, which is a good price for a laptop with this kind of hardware. I recommend this device to anyone looking for an affordable gaming laptop that can also be used as a work machine. If you like this laptop but want to save some cash, its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI+, is very similar and still relevant in 2025, retailing for $1,800.\nIf you want a more powerful graphic design computer, I suggest the Alienware 18 Area-51. It is a much more powerful gaming laptop that leaves every laptop I mentioned so far in the dust. I think it's one of the best for the year. It is, however, very expensive; my review unit cost $3,200."

TCL's Nxtpaper technology offers a paper-like screen that's made for tired eyes like mine. The TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G is the company's affordable attempt at relieving some of the stress that comes from modern smartphone screens.\nAlso: Changing this Android setting instantly doubled my phone speed (Samsung and Google models included)\nIt's a unique trick for a very inexpensive smartphone that needs to be seen to be understood. While far from perfect, and definitely a device built to a price, it brings a differentiator that will matter for some users looking to give their eyes a rest while they scroll or read.\nA unique multi-faceted display\nThe display is what immediately sets the 60XE apart. TCL's Nxtpaper 3.0 matte coating gives the glass an undeniably unique finish that I quite like. On-screen content looks a bit like E-ink depending on the mode the phone is in, but underneath that hazy layer is a standard 1080p, 120Hz LCD panel.\nThe coating addresses a slew of common downsides of modern displays. It reduces blue light, cuts reflections to nearly nothing, and even eliminates most fingerprints. There's also a nice texture that feels a bit like paper, which is a nice departure from a sea of glossy, reflective displays.\nBeneath the power and volume buttons is a physical Nxtpaper Key, a plastic switch that feels a bit cheaper than I'd like. Flipping the switch offers up a menu of distinct modes that change how the display operates.\nTCL clearly wants users to notice and appreciate this feature because every toggle results in a five-second full-screen animation complete with an obnoxious serenade. I made sure to set my volume to mute so I could avoid the theatrical effect.\nEach mode provides its own twist on usability and comfort. Color Paper Mode, my favorite, mutes the colors while retaining a standard Android interface that's easier on the eyes for all-day use. I even enjoyed watching YouTube videos in this mode, though everything feels a bit flatter than my eyes are used to.\nInk Paper Mode goes one step further, stripping color from icons and text for a no-frills grayscale approach, while still delivering the full unencumbered Android experience. Max Ink Mode is the most dramatic change, stripping all color while also limiting apps to a small subset of essentials and suspending certain background processes.\nAlso: iOS 26 envy? 5 iPhone features you can already use on your Android (Samsung included)\nThe result is an ultra-minimal, battery-saving mode that can last more than a week on a single charge. I enjoyed this mode for reading ebooks and could see it as a great solution for users looking to cut back on smartphone use entirely.\nThe display does come with a major caveat. On the brightest days, the matte finish would all but wash out on-screen content, often making it unusable in direct sunlight. If you spend time outside reading or working, you'll be looking for shade like I was.\nPerformance and battery\nPerformance is modest but serviceable, with a MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ processor inside paired with 8GB of RAM. In use, this is not a phone for hardcore users who push their devices to the limit. I noticed many actions have a slight delay attached to them. Launching the camera often takes a few seconds to negotiate.\nGeneral tasks like web browsing, email, and messaging are responsive enough to keep me happy, but things never felt snappy.\nOn the software front, the 60 XE runs Android 15, with a promise from TCL of just one upgrade to Android 16 and two years of security patches. As someone who always decries the poor state of Android OS update promises, this is a weak point, and TCL needs to step up its game. Anyone hoping to get long-term value should consider other options.\nAlso: I spent a week in New York City with the Samsung Z Fold 7 - and it spoiled me the entire time\nI found battery life to be a highlight, which isn't that surprising given the 5,010mAh battery hidden inside. I routinely made it through the day with around 20-30% capacity to spare at bedtime. Wired charging tops out at a slow 18 watts, so quick daytime top-ups will take some time, but it's fine for plugging in overnight.\nFor the truly battery paranoid, there's the Max Ink Mode that considerably jumps battery life to more than a week if you are willing to cut down on much of what the phone is capable of.\nStay for the display, but not the camera\nThe plastic marble-like backplate surrounds a large circular camera array that's hard to miss and perhaps even more premium-looking than its price point. One pet peeve of mine is an off-center camera module, and this phone has a notable wobble when placed on a tabletop as a result.\nThe camera system itself is one area where the low-end cutbacks really show. The main sensor does its best outdoors in very bright conditions and needs a lot of light to help shots taken indoors. The camera performance is mediocre with soft output that lacks punch and definition most of the time.\nLow-light conditions easily demonstrate the camera system's baseline capability, and the ultrawide lens often results in grainy images. The 32MP front camera works, but that's about it. Let's just say that this is not the phone for the discerning camera buff.\nZDNET's buying advice\nWhat the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G offers is a key standout feature: a unique matte display. At $250, the 60XE offers something that you really can't find anywhere else, in this price category and beyond, and the benefits of that might matter a lot for certain users. For everyone else, consider phones like the CMF Phone 2 Pro, which offers better imaging, better speed, and its signature modular design approach.\nFollow my latest tech reviews and projects across social media.

They combine the feel of handwriting with the convenience of cloud syncing. Plus, they're ultra-portable.\nWe tested tablets across all the major brands to find options that suit both students enjoying summer breaks and professionals sneaking out for a vacation. Some of these models can replace a laptop, while others are ideal for jotting notes on the go. We judged all of these tablets on performance, battery life, display, and writing experience.\nWhat is the best writing tablet you can buy right now?\nZDNET went hands-on with the following tablets, with our pick for the best note-taking tablet overall being the iPad Air, thanks to its lightweight build and compatibility with the 2nd-gen Apple Pencil. But we also included tablets from Boox, Amazon, and more to take digital notes on.\nAlso: The best tablets for students in 2025\nThe best note-taking tablets of 2025\nWhy we like it: The lightweight tablet can do everything -- including taking notes. While this isn't the latest version of the iPad Air, we chose this one since it costs less and has many of the same features as the M2 iPad Air, albeit a slightly slower processor. But for taking notes, this iPad Air is the way to go.\nIt's compatible with the Apple Pencil (second generation), making it easy to take notes in class or meetings and watch seminars virtually if needed. Apple's products are largely customizable, and this is no different: you can opt for one of five colors and get more or less storage depending on what you need.\nWho it's for: Even Android fans will like Apple's iPad Air. Plus, as we said in our review, the iPad Air \"is as powerful as the iPad Pro, but costs hundreds of dollars less.\"\nReview: Apple iPad Air (5th generation)\nIn addition, for students or professionals who might need to use their tablets while on the go often, a cellular data plan option ensures you can always get online to access.\nWho should look elsewhere: At $699 (even though it's not even the latest generation), it's an expensive note-taking tablet, so if budget is a key factor for you, you might want to consider other options.\niPad Air (5th generation) tech specs: Display: 10.9-inch Retina display | Processor: Apple Silicon M1 | Storage: 64GB or 256GB | Biometrics: Touch ID | Colors: Space gray, starlight, pink, purple, blue | Cameras: 12MP rear, 4K video. 12MP Ultra Wide camera | Weight: 1.02 pounds | Dimensions: 9.74 x 7.02 x 0.24 inches | Connections: USB-C port | Battery life: 10 hours\nWhy we like it: The Boox Note Air 4 C is a color e-ink tablet that is built for note-taking. The screen has a color 1240 x 930 (150 PPI) resolution and a 2480 x 1860 (300 PPI -- the same as the Kindle Scribe) resolution in black and white. Plus, it's super lightweight at just under a pound.\nThis tablet has all the best features of the top note-taking apps built right in: there are dozens of templates to use, audio recording, color-coding, inserting links and attachments to notes, and more. Plus, built-in artificial intelligence allows for text recognition, shape perfection, and a strike-through erase feature that makes erasing much easier.\nWho it's for: ZDNET writer Maria Diaz went hands-on with the tablet and called it \"great for professionals and creatives.\" \"It's not a productivity tablet or one to replace a laptop, but it is perfect for note-takers who like handwriting, journalers, reading enthusiasts, and even designers.\"\nReview: Boox Note Air 4 C\nPlus, it has several features that make it a productivity machine. For example, there is a split-screen feature that allows you to switch between two different apps. Verified customers like the BOOXdrop feature, which allows you to easily send files to the tablet from your computer or smartphone to the tablet. It takes mere seconds, and you can annotate PDFs and other Word documents with ease.\nWho should look elsewhere: If Android isn't your jam, you probably won't like the Boox Note Air 4 C, since it's noticeably slower than a traditional tablet like the iPad.\nBoox Note Air 4 C tech specs: Display: 10.3-inch Kaleido 3 display | Processor: 8-core, 2 GHz | Storage: 64GB | Memory: 6GB | Colors: Black | Weight: 0.95 pounds | Dimensions: 8.9 x 7.6 x 0.23 inches | Connections: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.1 | Battery life: 3,700mAh Li-ion Polymer\nWhy we like it: The Kindle Scribe is perhaps the perfect example of part e-reader, part tablet. It has the same functions you've come to know and love in a Kindle, like a 300 ppi glare-free screen, weeks of battery life, and adjustable warm light. It's also compatible with Amazon's Premium Pen, so you can take handwritten notes or underline important quotations within the book you're reading.\nYour notes are automatically organized in one place for every book so that you can browse, review, and export them via email. The Kindle Scribe also comes with preset templates to help you create notebooks, journals, and lists, and you can create sticky notes in Microsoft Word and other compatible Word documents.\nWho it's for: If you're someone who likes taking notes in the books you're reading, this note-taking tablet is for you. The new Active Canvas on the Kindle Scribe allows you to take notes and scribble your thoughts directly onto the pages of your book. ZDNET editor Kyle Kucharski put the Active Canvas to the test and appreciated the feature as an avid note-taker.\nReview: Amazon Kindle Scribe (2024)\n\"The cool design element here is that the notes you draw with the pan exist on another \"layer\" than the book text, allowing you to edit what you write without messing with the text in the book,\" he wrote in his review.\nIn addition, if you're someone with messy handwriting, the AI features can transcribe handwritten notes into text, making it easier to go back and read.\nWho should look elsewhere: If you're not someone who needs to scribble on the page or take a highlighter to what you're reading, you might be better off with the reMarkable Paper Pro, which costs about the same and is a considered a more premium device.\nKindle Scribe tech specs: Display: 10.2-inch 300 ppi Paperwhite display | Storage: 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB | Weight: 0.96 pounds | Dimensions: 7.7 x 9.0 x 0.22 inches | Battery life: Up to 12 weeks (at 30 minutes per day)\nWhy we like it: The reMarkable Paper Pro is an improvement from the reMarkable 2, and it's clear developers took user suggestions to heart when they approached the design for the Paper Pro. Its aesthetic is premium and minimalist, with a larger color screen and adjustable backlight.\nReview: reMarkable Paper Pro\nKyle Kucharski also went hands-on with the Paper Pro, and was especially impressed with the writing experience. \"The pesky latency you often find when using a stylus is absent altogether here; there is zero lag between the motion of your hand and the line you're drawing on the device's screen, resulting in a realistic, enjoyable writing experience,\" he wrote in his review.\nWho it's for: This device is for people looking to seriously lock into their productivity. The Paper Pro can't browse the web, play videos, or edit your photos, but that's the point. Instead, it takes a more disconnected approach to help you get what you need done with productivity tools like templates, workflow and app connections, and an additional Type Folio to combine handwriting and typing into one device.\nWho should look elsewhere: This note-taking tablet looks and feels more high end, and has a high price tag to match. Plus, an additional subscription is required to access the full suite of useful features. If you're budget is $500 or less, we recommend checking out a Boox tablet instead.\nreMarkable Paper Pro specs: Display: 11.8-inch display with 2160 x 1620 resolution and 229 ppi | Processor: 1.8 GHz quad-core Cortex-A53 | Storage: 64GB | Weight: 2.43 ounces | Dimensions: 10.8 x 7.8 inches | Connections: USB-C port | Battery life: Up to 14 days\nWhy we like it: The Tab S10+ comes with 12GB of memory and 256GB or 512GB of storage, with the option to expand to up to 1TB of storage using microSD.. Inside the Tab S10+ is the MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ processor.\nMost importantly, the S10+ comes with an S Pen that you can use to write or draw on your favorite apps. New to the S10 lineup are Galaxy AI features that enhance your note-taking even further, like Note Assist, which allows you to transcribe, organize, and even summarize notes.\nWho it's for: If you want something to help with productivity, this tablet is for you. Diaz tested the S10 Ultra model (which has the same display and features but is larger and comes with more storage options), calling it one of the best productivity tablets, even when compared to the reMarkable 2 or iPad Pro.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra\n\"These AI tools are enhanced by the included S Pen, Samsung's IP68-rated Bluetooth stylus that offers high-precision sketching and writing,\" she wrote in her review, adding, \"I love using the S Pen to take notes and color on the tablet, but the AI tools, like Sketch-to-Image, are a new, fun way to make the most of this tool.\"\nWho should look elsewhere: This tablet is even more expensive than the iPad Air, starting at $1,300. Since it's an investment, if you're not looking for an all-in-one tablet or don't care about the best and newest features or AI compatibility, you should think about the Boox Note Air 4 C, which is also an Android-run tablet but more \"dumbed-down\" than the S10 Ultra.\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S10+ tech specs: Display: 12.3-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X 2560 x 1600 display | Processor: MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ | Storage: 256GB, 512GB (up to 1.5TB with microSD) | Memory: 12GB | Colors: Moonstone gray and platinum silver | Cameras: Rear: 13MP main, 8MP ultrawide, Front: 12MP ultrawide | Weight: 1.27 pounds | Dimensions: 11.24 X 7.3 X 0.22 inches | Connectivity: 5G, LTE, W\nWhat is the best note-taking tablet?\nThe best note-taking tablet is the iPad Air based on price, ratings, display, features, and more. It's also super lightweight, making it the perfect choice to carry anywhere.\nNote-taking Tablet | Price | Display | Pen/Stylus |\nApple iPad Air | $325 | 10.9-inch Retina display | Apple Pencil (2nd generation) |\nBoox Note Air 4 C | $690 | 10.3-inch Kaleido 3 display | BOOX Pen Plus |\nAmazon Kindle Scribe | $450 | 10.2-inch 300 ppi Paperwhite display | Amazon Premium Pen |\nreMarkable Paper Pro | $629 | 11.8-inch 2160 x 1620 display | reMarkable Marker or Marker Plus |\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S10+ | $1,050 | 12.3-inch, Dynamic AMOLED 2X 2960 x 1848 display | S Pen |\n*Lowest price at the time of writing. Please note that prices may vary based on retailer and available promotions, sales, or discounts.\nWhich note-taking tablet is right for you?\nChoosing a tablet really comes down to what you want to use it for and what you want to spend. Basic tablets tend to be cheaper, so if you don't plan to use them for much other than taking notes, you can look at spending a little less and getting something like an Amazon Fire Tablet.\nHowever, if you want a tablet you can use for school and for everyday things like streaming, photo editing, and more, something like an iPad might be a better choice.\nChoose this note-taking tablet... | If you want... |\nApple iPad Air | The best overall option. It's as powerful as the iPad Pro but much lighter and less expensive. |\nBoox Note Air 4 C | A lightweight note-taking tablet. It comes with dozens of templates to choose from and useful note-taking and productivity features. |\nAmazon Kindle Scribe | A tablet and e-reader in one. You can make notes within the book(s) you are reading, as well as through apps like Microsoft Word. |\nreMarkable Paper Pro | A high-end, premium note-taking tablet that puts productivity at the forefront of its purpose. |\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S9 | A Samsung tablet for note-taking. An S Pen is included in the box. |\nFactors to consider when choosing the best note-taking tablet\nBefore you buy a note-taking tablet, you'll want to consider the following:\n- Display: A tablet's experience is largely based on its display, so pay attention to tablets with HD resolutions and even paper-like displays.\n- Stylus compatibility: Most people use a stylus when taking notes on a tablet, so consider tablets that either come with a stylus right out of the box or have the option to buy one from the maker separately. It's important to note most universal styluses will also work with these tablets.\n- Size: Tablets that you will mainly use for note-taking purposes will have different requirements than tablets you need to replace a laptop with. Smaller size tablets are best for note-taking purposes and are lightweight and portable.\n- Price: Tablets will vary in price from $150 all the way up to $1,000 or more, depending on storage capacity, display quality, processors, and more.\nHow we test tablets\nThe ZDNET team chose all of the tablets included in this list based on their performance when tested in the real world. When we test tablets, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.\n- Display: We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy.\nWe also compare the display's performance with what the manufacturer promised, test the screen's responsiveness to touch, and assess the performance of any extra features, like a manufacturer's stylus.\nPerformance: For real-world performance metrics, our reviewers measure how quickly the tablet reacts to input, assess game performance and frame rates, test how the tablet handles having multiple apps running simultaneously, measure the time it takes to launch apps, and even assess the tablet's temperature during intensive tasks.\n- Battery life: We test different scenarios for battery life, including measuring how long the battery lasts while streaming, web browsing, using productivity apps, and playing games.\n- Camera and audio: For cameras, we evaluate features like resolution, aperture, low-light performance, autofocus accuracy, dynamic range, color accuracy, image quality, sharpness, and video quality. For audio, we look at the sound quality and overall listening experience, including audio clarity at different volumes, stereo separation of left and right audio channels, maximum volume level in various environments, and if there is perceived distortion.\nFor a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive tablet testing methodology.\nLatest news on writing tablets in 2025\nA recent study commissioned by Remarkable and overseen by neuroscientist Dr Thomas Zo\u00ebga Rams\u00f8y from the Copenhagen Business School showed that a digital tablet can actually contribute to productivity. The participants who worked on digital paper tablets (like the reMarkable Paper Pro, Amazon Kindle Scribe, or Boox Note Air 4 C) had 35% lower stress levels while completing their tasks than those who used computers, as well as a 30% reduction in cognitive load. Additionally, the study found that the participants who used tablets experienced 25% higher visual and verbal creativity, while maintaining 17% better memory recall.\nIt's important to note that the sample size of the study was only 60 participants, and the fact that it was commissioned by Remarkable might suggest that the results could be skewed. However, the data was acquired via medically standard methods of measuring stress, namely electroencephalography (EEG) brain monitoring and heart-rate variability (HRV), making it a compelling argument for tablets over computers when it comes to being productive.\nFAQs on note-taking tablets\nDigital notepad vs Tablet: Which is better for taking notes?\nMany of our top picks can be considered digital notebooks over traditional tablets, and there is a unique difference. Traditional tablets like the iPad Air and Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra have all the capabilities of a computer, meaning they can browse the web, access software and programs like Photoshop, can take photos or videos, and are great for media consumption through apps.\nAlso: The best smart notebooks you can buy\nOn the other hand, a digital notebook like reMarkable Paper Pro or Boox Note Air 4 C still has a processor and storage like that of a tablet, but is more focused on the specific task of note-taking. These devices will feel more like paper thanks to a dedicated E-ink screen and usually have a much longer battery life than tablets,, since you're just using them to write.\nDo I need a stylus for a note-taking tablet?\nUsing a stylus is totally up to you, but it can definitely help with functionality. Some tablets come with a stylus, while others will have them sold separately. If you're looking at this from a cost perspective, consider the fact that the stylus will often be an added expense, but you may find it worth it for ease of use, especially if you're the type that likes the feeling of writing out your notes rather than typing them.\nWhat are the best note-taking apps?\nThe best note-taking apps let you digitize your notes and to-dos while keeping them all in one place or syncing them to a cloud. Our favorites are Notability, Evernote, GoodNotes 5, and even Apple's free Notes app is a worthy choice.\nDoes the Apple Pencil convert handwriting to text?\nYes--the Apple Pencil can convert your handwritten notes into text for better legibility. Here's how:\n- In the Notes or Freeform apps, tap to show the tool palette.\n- In the tool palette, tap the Handwriting tool (to the left of the pen).\n- Write with Apple Pencil, and Scribble automatically converts your handwriting into typed text.\nAre writing tablets good for drawing too?\nActually, no. A writing tablet like the Amazon Kindle Scribe or the reMarkable Paper Pro are specifically made with writing in mind, and a paperlike screen and lag when flipping pages or swapping tools make it not an ideal device for drawing or sketching.\nHowever, a traditional tablet like the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra would double as a good drawing tablet, since you can work on apps like Photoshop or Sketchbook with ease.\nRecent updates\n- In our May 2025 update, we added the reMarkable Paper Pro as a top pick, added more context on features of products, and added news about a recent study that shows people are more productive using E-ink tablets compared to computers."

If we have made an error or published misleading information, we will correct or clarify the article. If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nThis 8-inch gaming tablet is the ultimate plane entertainment device (and on sale)\nThe Legion Tab Gen 3 joins Lenovo's gaming lineup as a slim and light eight-inch Android tablet with a brilliant 2.5K, 165Hz display, and 12GB of RAM. These specs, combined with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor and a handful of intelligent design elements make it a versatile and premium gaming tablet, earning our Editors' Choice award.\nThe first thing you notice upon picking up the Legion Tab is how small and minimalist it is, somewhat obscuring its gaming motivations. With its small size and ultra-thin bezels around the edges, it feels more like a thin sheet of black glass than a gaming device, but looking a little closer reveals some solid engineering.\nAlso: The Samsung tablet I recommend most isn't the newest (but it is on sale)\nThe only two physical buttons on the device -- volume and power -- blend into the side of the tablet. Additionally, there are two USB-C ports: one on the side, and one on the bottom. Since you can flip the orientation of the display in any direction, this means you can plug in the device on any of the four sides.\nThis makes the Legion Tab an optimal travel device, since you can adjust your charging setup every time you're in a new place, while support for Wi-Fi 7 future-proofs its portability.\nUnder the hood, the Legion Tab is equipped with the aforementioned Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (3.30 GHz) processor, coincidentally matching the name of the tablet. For comparison, this is the same processor family found in competing tablets we love, like the OnePlus Pad 2.\nAlso: I traded my business computer for a Lenovo Legion laptop for work, and didn't miss it\nIt also has 12GB of soldered LPDDR5X memory, 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage, and Android 14 OS. The bottom (or top) port can be used to connect to an external monitor via DisplayPort, which, when swapped into PC Mode, turns the tablet into a capable laptop. More on that in a minute.\nThe tablet's display looks fantastic. Not everything needs to be an OLED to be considered premium, and the Legion Tab's 8.8-inch LTPS (low-temperature polycrystalline silicon) proves just that. With a 165Hz refresh rate, 500nit (900 for HDR) brightness, and 2560 x 1600 resolution, it's fully prepared for whatever gaming motivations you may have, delivering smooth, crisp visuals and vivid colors.\nAndroid OS allows you to fine-tune the display to a granular level, selecting different color profiles and refresh rates for each app. This also makes it a solid device for watching movies, alongside its intended use case as a gaming tablet.\nAlso: I replaced my iPad with this $100 Android tablet for a month, and it had no problem keeping up\nPortability isn't the only reason why some folks might prefer a smaller tablet like the Legion Tab. It's also just big enough for the entire screen to be accessible with opposing thumbs if you're holding it with two hands. This makes it feel more like a gaming handheld, like the MSI Claw 8 AI+, with a sleek touchscreen instead of controls.\nI didn't get a chance to test out the Legion Tab with a third-party controller like the GameSir G8, but I imagine the Legion Tab's eight-inch display makes a fantastic gaming console at a practical size. Additionally, the dual USB-C ports mean you can play in either orientation.\nWhile gaming, you can access a handful of settings and stats with a left or right swipe, pulling out the Legion menu to swap between performance modes, see CPU usage, and screen record.\nYou can also enable charge bypass on this menu, which is a great quality-of-life setting. This allows you to supply power directly to the tablet while plugged in, bypassing the battery entirely to keep it running cool, even during extended sessions.\nAlso: I've tested dozens of tablets - this is the first Android model to truly replace my iPad Pro\nThe Legion Tab earns another point for its thoughtful design here, with Lenovo's ColdFront Vapor Chamber positioned over the processor near the center of the device -- away from where your hands are -- to further mitigate heat while you're holding it.\nThe tablet comes with Black Desert Online preinstalled, so it was the first game I fired up, and it played nearly flawlessly with max settings. Popular mobile games like Flame of Valhalla, Hearthstone, and League of Legends: Wild Rift delivered zero lag or performance issues, and crisp, bright visuals, responsive UI navigation, and surprisingly good sound.\nThe Legion Tab comes with its own case, which is rather necessary given its very thin body. Luckily, it also doubles as a stand if you want to prop it up. The screen cover just as easily snaps off, leaving just the backing case. This is just as good because it's a little awkward to hold -- you have to fold the case all the way back while holding it.\nAlso: This $220 Android tablet feels just like my Surface Pro - and the battery is just as good\nAlong with the case and magnetic cover, 68W USB-C wall charger and cable, I also appreciate that it comes with its own screen protector, going above and beyond to supply the essentials when it's becoming more common these days to make consumers buy these things separately.\nConnecting to an external monitor is also as easy as popping in a DisplayPort-compatible cable. PC mode with a keyboard and mouse works surprisingly well, as it's essentially a Chromebook Plus with this RAM/storage configuration and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor.\nI've been bringing the Legion Tab into the office, where I have a docking station connected to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, and it worked so well in this use case, it could even replace a laptop altogether for office visits or travel where a Chromebook suffices: accessing Gmail, working out of the cloud in Chrome, and standard videoconferencing.\nOn that note, the main 13MP camera with flash is about what you'd find on a smartphone, while the front-facing 8MP full-frame is sufficient for video calls.\nAlso: One of the best budget Android tablets I've tested isn't made by Samsung or Google\nIn terms of battery life, the Legion Tab is well-balanced for a gaming tablet. However, its small size works both for and against it, as the 6550mAh battery limits the amount of juice it can hold. That being said, it's efficient, lasting several days with intermittent use or several hours of sustained gaming at 165Hz. In my testing, I got around 12 hours of video playback at 60Hz and half brightness.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe Lenovo Legion Tab 3 succeeds at delivering a fantastic gaming experience thanks to its gorgeous display and impressive performance. It's sleek and premium, well-engineered, and packed with intelligent design choices. To top it off, its small size makes it a particularly practical travel device, and brings all of this for a competitive price of $549.\nWhy the Lenovo Legion Tab 3 gets an Editors' Choice award\nIf you're looking for a thin and light tablet that's expressly portable, the Legion Tab is one of the best eight-inch tablets I've used, with a top-tier processor, Wi-Fi 7, and bypass charging. For all these reasons, it's earned our Editors' Choice award as a versatile device that's straight up fun to use."

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nI replaced my Samsung OLED TV with this Sony Mini LED model for a week - and didn't regret it\nSony Bravia 5 TV (98-inch)\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Enhanced color, contrast, and clarity make this TV live up to its hype.\n- It handily delivers upscaled HDR content and high-speed footage.\n- A soundbar will complement its size, and its off-angle viewing can be less than perfect.\nSony recently sent us the 2025 Bravia 5 TV, this one with a 98-inch screen and weighing in at 158 pounds. It goes without saying that this TV is a beast -- an expensive one. And the Bravia 5 is not even considered the company's flagship model (you can look to the Bravia 8 II and Bravia 9 for that). But this TV is impressive, and after testing it for a week, I'll explain why.\nAlso: You should turn off this default TV setting ASAP - and why even experts recommend it\nThe Bravia 5 is a Google TV, so setting up the UI was fairly easy using the remote and the Google Home app on my phone. But be prepared for a series of screens requiring you to check boxes for privacy disclaimers. The era of streaming content has become very complicated.\nOtherwise, the interface is intuitive, offering quick access to a vast selection of streaming services, apps, and voice control capabilities via Google Assistant. The personalization features are also a plus for helping you discover new content.\nThis behemoth of a display comes with a relatively small remote control. It's slender and lightweight, and if you have fat fingers like me, you might accidentally press enter when you meant to press a navigation button.\nAlso: Your TV's USB port has an underrated feature that can revitalize an old system for free\nI appreciate the downsizing of remotes across most brands these days. Yet despite all the streamlining, Sony (and most others) insist on including dedicated app buttons. You know, for Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, and whatever other platforms the manufacturer contracts with. These buttons take up a lot of real estate and make the remote seem almost \"disposable\" because brands get bought, sold, and sometimes change names.\nFor example, I have a Roku TV with a Vudu button. Who or what is Vudu? That platform still exists, but it's now known as Fandango Media (a joint venture between NBC Universal and Warner Bros.).\nI don't mean to make an example of Sony; its engineers are simply abiding by the current trend. Yet, I haven't met anyone who says they use these dedicated app buttons. When you have a smartly designed home screen, you don't need them.\nThat is one of my two peevish critiques of the Sony Bravia 5. Second is the fact that this remote is not backlit. Come on, Sony. If I'm buying a $6,000 TV, I envision a home cinema experience in the dark (just like in a movie theatre). This means I don't want to turn on my phone to aim a light source at the \"magic wand\" just so I can pause the thing when my DoorDash order arrives. To me, backlighting on remotes seems like a simple ask for anything above a budget model television.\nApologies for my digressionary rant on remote control design. Despite these minor gripes, it became clear to me that the Bravia 5 has plenty to shout about.\nAlso: The next big HDMI leap has arrived - how the 2.2 standard is shaking things up\nFor one thing, Sony's prowess in display technology is impressive. Its proprietary Cognitive Processor XR upscales images beautifully, ensuring motion is slippery smooth with minimal blur. From fast-paced action scenes in the 2023 Mission: Impossible rendition to 2025 NBA highlights, the Bravia 5 delivered 4K resolution with exceptional clarity, vibrant colors, and impressive contrast. HDR content truly pops, showcasing deep blacks and brilliant highlights.\nWhile 4K content looks phenomenal, lower-resolution content (like older cable broadcasts) tends to reveal imperfections more noticeably on such a large screen, even with the XR processor's excellent upscaling.\nThe Sony Bravia 5 can display up to a 120Hz refresh rate with VRR and ALLM enabled, which means the TV dynamically adjusts to match the frame rate of the content being displayed. This is especially good news for gamers. With those kinds of specs, playing Fortnite on a display of this size is an electrifying experience. The Bravia 5 showed no sign of screen tearing, with exquisitely responsive gameplay.\nAlso: The best Sony TVs of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nAlready impressed by the images on this behemoth TV, I ran a few tests at the lab for dirty screen effect, burn-in, and blooming. I clocked no degradation, even close to the edges. The color test was consistent; the subtitle test yielded no visible blooming, and the scrolling text motion was liquid.\nHaving said that, viewing the Bravia 5 from side angles was not the best. It's fair to assume that, with the same build and technology in a smaller Bravia 5, this would also be the case. With a 98-inch screen, though, you probably won't get many complaints from someone sitting on the far edge of your couch. And while Sony TVs generally handle reflections well, a screen this large can still be susceptible to glare in brightly lit rooms, so strategic placement and light control are important factors. (You might consider getting some blackout curtains.)\nAlso: I changed 12 settings on my Apple TV to instantly improve the performance\nThis Mini LED TV bears a peak brightness of around 800 nits. That isn't eye-popping OLED-level brightness, but in a dark room, you might want to lower the brightness on a Bravia 5 to prevent eye strain. Trust me, the TV is plenty bright, and it can accommodate seating from any conceivable home theater.\nWhat about sound? The Sony Bravia 5 uses Sony's Acoustic Multi-Audio system, and it's worth some praise. It combines two down-firing X-Balanced speakers for bass and midrange with a pair of Sound Positioning tweeters on the top corners of the back panel to handle mids and highs. The result is a well-balanced listening experience, with clear dialogue and vocals complemented by ambient effects that fill the space nicely.\nFor the ultimate audio experience, though, the Sony Bravia 5 could use a companion soundbar to round things out. Again, if you're investing this much in a giant screen, then your budget might not be too far stretched to install a comprehensive surround sound system as well.\nAlso: This is the soundbar I recommend for deeply immersive audio - and now it's $300 off\nThe Bravia 5 has an impressive array of connectivity options, including Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 on the wireless side, and several physical ports. I really like how Sony included an infographic panel (of sorts) right next to each port to make it clear which cables go where. It comes with four HDMI ports -- one of them eARC (for that soundbar you should buy), another being 4K at 120Hz (for your online gaming needs).\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe 98-inch Sony Bravia 5 is a formidable piece of home entertainment technology. Its stunning picture quality, immersive scale, and excellent smart features make it a dream display for any cinephile or gaming enthusiast.\nGrand proportions notwithstanding, Sony's quality will shine through on any smaller-sized Bravia 5 screen. This one runs for about $5,999, whereas you can get an 85-inch Bravia 5 for less than half that price or a 75-inch for one-third the cost.\nEven if it's not about the money, not every home can accommodate a colossal 98-inch panel. So, if your home's parameters aren't suitable for something this big, you'll arguably be getting a better value by downsizing a step or two on screen size.\nIf you have the budget and space, the Bravia 5 delivers on its promise of a magnificent viewing experience. And if you're seeking the ultimate home cinema experience, pair this TV with a high-end soundbar to match the visual grandeur with equally powerful and nuanced audio.\nHow we test TVs\nWhile testing and researching the TVs featured on this list, I and other ZDNET experts kept these criteria in mind:\n- Price: Not all budgets are created equal. And if you're working with a limited budget, that shouldn't mean you have to settle for a sub-par TV.\n- Screen size: The most important factor to consider, after price, when shopping for a new TV is whether or not it will fit into your space.\n- Picture and audio quality: A new TV doesn't mean much, even if it costs an arm and a leg, if it doesn't provide a great picture and clear audio. The best TVs we test have often been ensured to support various HDR codecs, including HDR10+ and Dolby Vision, as well as enhanced audio software like Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus, and object-tracking sound.\nFor a more detailed look, check out our extensive TV testing methodology."

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nI found an E Ink tablet worthy of replacing my Remarkable, and it's on sale\nBoox Note Max\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- The Boox Note Max comes bundled with the pen and case for $649.\n- It's thin and light, has a high-contrast display, and has a long list of features that make it a very versatile device.\n- Theres no backlight, it's monochromatic, and there's a bit of a learning curve to use it to its fullest.\nThe Boox Note Max is $60 off on Amazon right now, making it cost $630.\nI went hands-on with the Remarkable Paper Pro last year and thought that was a big tablet. The latest Boox Note Max takes things to another level with a 13.3-inch display, the size of a standard A4 piece of paper. It's almost as thin, too -- at just 0.18 inches, resulting in a physically impressive, premium device.\nAlso: This big-screen Samsung tablet is the iPad Pro alternative Android users have been waiting for\nThe capacitive touch display is a smooth glass-covered Carta 1300 screen, unlike the slightly more textured surface on the Remarkable Paper Pro. I won't keep bringing up the Remarkable, I promise, but the comparison between the two has to be made since these two devices are the only premium e-readers on the same level in terms of performance and features.\nThe Boox Note Max has a resolution of 3200 x 2400 (QUXGA) and features 300 pixels per inch. When combined with the thin form factor, this delivers a very high-contrast, sharp image with ink that appears very close to the surface, like paper.\nThe device itself is remarkably thin, weighing 615 grams (1.3 pounds), but it doesn't feel fragile. It's premium but rather neutral, with rounded corners and a clean white backing. The entire tablet feels like one single unit, without any bend or give between the components. The best part: when lying flat on a table, it resembles a piece of paper.\nUnder the hood, it has 6GB of RAM and a 2.8Ghz Snapdragon A55 processor, with support for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0. The hardware results in fast-enough speeds when navigating through the windows, but it's not instantaneous, as there is a bit of a delay that's normal fare with e-readers. The on-screen keyboard, in particular, requires some deliberate finger poking to type with, but it is just one of those things you get used to.\nAlso: I'm struggling to replace my Kindle Paperwhite with other E Ink tablets because of this feature\nThe display is monochromatic, which means no color, and importantly, there's no backlight, which means you aren't really going to be able to use it in low light. The ultrathin and light form factor is the trade-off for these two features resulting in the device's ultrathin, uniform design. The plus side of this is that it looks great in bright light, so you could easily take it to the beach.\nThe writing experience on the Note Max is very satisfying. The pen is not as heavy as the one that comes with the Remarkable Paper Pro, but it has a cap and a precise tip with just the slightest bit of give when you write with it. The result, on the tablet's smooth surface, is immensely enjoyable and completely lag-free.\nThere are a handful of brushes and pens to use, and the toolbar's sliding menus make brush adjustments easy. The pen, in particular, is the most true-to-life digital replication of a fountain pen I've ever seen. It has a responsive and tactile feel that directly corresponds to how hard you press the tip. There's even a little bit of \"bleed\" of ink when you really push down.\nThe monochromatic display does let you choose \"colors,\" but they're essentially just varying degrees of gray, useful for highlighting or creating some contrast on your designs. There are also a handful of 3D shapes you can draw, making for some interesting on-the-fly designs like charts, graphs, or mock-ups.\nOne thing I noticed, however, is that the touch sensors on the Note Max are a little finicky. Resting your hand on the display while using the pen can result in repeated false inputs or activation of gestures. This is one of those settings that you're going to have to spend a moment adjusting. You can turn off or limit gestures or simply disable touch altogether and have it only recognize the pen.\nAlso: Why the Kindle Paperwhite is my favorite E Ink reader right now - beating Boox and Kobo\nThe tablet also features built-in dual speakers and a mic, the former of which can get surprisingly loud. I never really considered streaming music from an e-reader, but it's absolutely possible -- easy, even -- especially with a Bluetooth connection.\nIn fact, this is one of the first things I noticed about the Note Max: there are lots of features and settings, so much so that most users probably won't utilize all of them. The amount of granularity in virtually every setting on the device is even a little astounding, making this device really shine in the hands of engaged power users who enjoy discovering new ways to interact with it.\nFor example, there's a highly customizable split screen feature, completely freeform markup capabilities on text, translation features, read-aloud features, and a rich linking system that I appreciate as an avid note-taker. You can highlight a specific section, or even a single word, and link it to external webpages, but more interestingly, to your own notebooks and documents stored locally on the device.\nThere's a Kids Mode, a screen recorder, the ability to use the device as a hotspot, a built-in file drop capability, and compatibility with most file types. Even the floating toolbar is completely customizable, allowing the user to drag and drop the features they use most and anchor and resize it to whatever part of the screen is most useful.\nAlso: I gave away my Kindle and iPad within hours of using this tablet\nSo let's talk about some of the drawbacks. One of the biggest concerns I had with the Note Max is visual ghosting. The Boox Note excels at generating text: it's crisp and high-contrast, even with the fast refresh setting on.\nBut it has a harder time with pages featuring heavy graphics, especially full-page images from magazines, so much so that you can clearly read the previous pages' ink remaining on the display.\nNo matter what setting you're in, there are light artifacts, but switching to the faster display settings greatly mitigates ghosting (just keep in mind that it will require more battery). Speaking of the battery on the Note Max, it is good, but it isn't one that you can simply forget about.\nBoox states that the device has around 32 hours of battery life if used solely as an e-reader, but only around seven hours if used for more demanding tasks like writing.\nI found this to be about accurate. If you're using the Note Max primarily for drawing and note taking, but only intermittently, it will certainly last a few days, but not much beyond that. Luckily, it charges very fast: gaining about 50% in 30 minutes.\nLastly, I should note that there is the Note Max Magnetic Keyboard cover that can be paired with the device for $150, bringing the device more into laptop territory, particularly because the keyboard has its own trackpad. The keyboard and trackpad (like all the other functions on the Note Max) come with an extensive list of customizations and functionalities that I didn't have a chance to test out personally, but I would imagine is ideal for users working extensively with text documents and functional editing.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe Boox Note Max is a powerful, versatile tool that can be many things. If you just want a lightweight big-screen e-reader, it does that exceedingly well. But if you want a highly customizable device for everything from document review to mock-up and sketch creation to extensive note-taking, it has an exhaustive list of features and settings to satisfy the needs of demanding power users.\nThe only other device on the market (that I've tested, at least) that comes close to this level of premium note-taking is the Remarkable Paper Pro, which is thicker and heavier but has a color display and a backlight in exchange. In terms of features, the Note Max tries to do a little bit of everything, and the menus and settings tend to put themselves in front of your face in a way that might be frustrating for casual users.\nAll in all, it's a fantastic device that reveals itself over time and one that I absolutely recommend, particularly if you don't need a backlight or color display. I appreciate that it comes with the pen and case for $650, which is certainly not cheap but well-priced for all it can do."

The electronics have improved, but the basic act of operating a digital camera has remained mostly the same. Cameras are a gaggle of buttons that are a cryptic arrangement to anyone but the initiated.\nThe real innovation in the picture-taking experience has been the smartphone, which has made picture-taking an always-available tool for documenting everything with relative ease.\nThere is still an audience, however, for innovation beyond what smartphones offer. Young consumers keep buying digital cameras, and a new generation is always interested to learn more about photography as an art.\nAlso: The best vlogging cameras of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nInto the void steps lens and camera maker Sigma Corp., based in Kanagawa, Japan, just outside Tokyo. The company this spring introduced a radical redesign of the digital camera's basic mode of use.\nThe Sigma BF, as it's called, reduces the mass of buttons to a small set of touch-sensitive controls. All the functions of digital photography are still there to be experimented with and exploited -- shutter speed, lens aperture, or \"f-stop,\" and \"ISO,\" the level of light that can be recovered from a scene -- but they are under your command in a radically simplified user interface.\nI've been testing the BF for some weeks now, and I'm smitten with the changes. The hardware's design is beautiful, and the new user interface is very thoughtful. The name \"BF\" stands for \"beautiful foolishness,\" and you could say this kind of redesign is crazy, but I love it.\nA camera for a new age of photographers\nSigma, a sixty-three-year-old company, makes most of its money from lenses for all camera brands. As a result, its cameras have tended to be somewhat experimental, never selling in the same volume as Sony, Canon, or Nikon. That means that the company takes chances. Often, the results are wild and beautiful.\nThe BF is really meant for a new age of prosumers who want to up their game in photography. At a retail price of $2,199, the price is not insignificant, but it is on the low end for what you'd pay for a very good 35mm digital camera these days. Lenses, which have to be bought separately, run from about $600 for a fixed focal length \"prime\" lens to $1,300 or more for zoom lenses. The BF uses what's called an \"L-mount,\" which means you're not limited to Sigma's lenses; it's also compatible with lenses from Leica, Panasonic, Samyang, and Sirui.\nAlso: Eufy's latest security camera has AI-powered color night vision - and no monthly fees\nThe premise of stepping up your game from the smartphone camera is pretty simple, to my mind: You will never, ever, get as good a picture with any smartphone camera as you will with a camera that has a real lens. The lens is the key. The optics are just so superior to the optics on a smartphone.\nI tested the BF with a 50mm prime lens from Sigma, the same kind I already use for most of my photography.\nNo matter what you are photographing, there are immediate benefits to using a real camera versus a smartphone camera.\nOne benefit is the detail you get. Here's a picture of a butterfly landing on some vegetation in a vivarium. When cropping the image to see the butterfly up close, you'll get a level of detail that is clean rather than the murky detail you get even with a smartphone's optical zoom:\n(None of these photos have been edited. They are all straight out of the camera. In some cases, the file size has been compressed to accommodate the publishing system.)\nNot only detail but also control of the depth of field via the aperture dial on the lens provides control over the selective blurring of objects, the \"bokeh.\"\nSmartphones will give you fake bokeh that is generated in software rather than the actual bending of the light via the lens elements. Rarely will fake bokeh give you a really complex, thrilling effect where both foreground and background elements are selectively blurred, leading to a more sophisticated image, such as this cypress I snapped in New York's Central Park:\nAnd even when fake bokeh works, I don't think you'll achieve the almost holographic, floating beauty you get with a real lens while preserving all the detail of the foreground subject, as with this thistle:\nThe second advantage is that a real lens will give you more real proportions than a smartphone lens that has a lot of barrel distortion. Like a building architectural shot or this bank vault:\nYou can get a nice, crisp skyline shot at twilight as the light changes:\nA swing to simplicity\nWhere the BF departs from other cameras is in the simplicity of design and user interface.\nThe hardware is, very simply, a solid shell milled from a block of aluminum and then filled with electronics. It's a gorgeous manufactured object with a super solid feel. (Sigma cameras always feel super solid, but this is on a new level.)\nThe BF's body is one of the lightest full-frame mirrorless cameras on the market, at just under a pound, compared to devices such as the Sony a7 IV, which weighs nearly a pound and a half.\nFor non-camera users, the weight of any real camera is something of a surprise compared to a smartphone such as an Apple iPhone Pro, which weighs half a pound. Holding 15 ounces worth of an unfamiliar object prompted some people to whom I handed the BF to remark, \"It's so heavy!\"\nAlso: First look at iPhone 17 Pro? Public images seemingly confirm big design and camera changes\nThe total weight of the camera is the combination of the 15 ounces and the 12 ounces of the 50mm Sigma lens. That kind of heft is typical of full-frame lenses because they have a lot of glass inside them. (And this particular Sigma lens is not very heavy as 50-millimeter lenses go.)\nThe real adjustment for a novice photographer is getting used to the balance of weight between camera and lens versus carrying a slab of a smartphone with uniform weight distribution.\nThe camera comes in two finishes, a striking silver color and a deep black. I chose to try the black as I like to use the camera often in discreet settings such as a jazz club, so I wanted something less flashy than the silver.\nThe sensor is a full-frame, 35mm Sony chip with just under 25 megapixels, less than the 60 megapixels in some 35mm cameras. Despite a lower pixel count, I found the sensor produced rich detail, certainly enough for Instagram pictures and possibly good enough for wall-sized prints depending on the exposure. Sony is a very reliable name for sensors, so it makes sense for Sigma to go with the market leader.\nImages are stored in the internal 230-gigabyte flash memory, which I found to be more than enough for my purposes. I usually offloaded the pictures onto my iPad or MacBook after each photo-taking session via USB-C and then cleared the BF's memory.\nAlso: Why the best fix for headless server frustration might be a little box named Comet\nOn the software side, the radical simplification of the user interface is striking -- it's even something of a revelation.\nI've been a user of Sigma cameras for over a decade, my main camera these days being the Sigma fp-L, a 60-megapixel model introduced a couple of years ago. I love that camera, but I would be very happy to see the changes in the BF user interface become standard on Sigma cameras going forward.\nThe main innovation is removing a lot of shooting information from the LCD screen. Instead of seeing the aperture or shutter speed and other settings constantly on the display, each setting on the BF occupies a separate, tiny LCD -- it's called a \"status monitor\" though I tend to think of it as simply a \"mini-LCD\" -- to the right of the main display.\nA click wheel just below the mini-LCD, formally called the \"dial pad,\" reminiscent of the first Apple iPod's click wheel, lets you rotate through the values of shutter speed, etc. The changing values are displayed on the mini-LCD as you do so, and you click the center button of the click wheel to select the setting you want.\nThere's also a touch-sensitive playback button, so you can peek at what you just snapped with a soft touch, and a touch-sensitive menu button, which is a quick way to peek at the camera's settings. And a power button at the bottom of all this, of course.\nThe effect is that the main display screen is a pristine window into what you're capturing in the real world, while the mini-LCD and the click-wheel are your controls. It's a nice division that elegantly separates the gaze from the adjustments.\nThe main LCD is a 2.1 megapixel model and is terrifically responsive for things such as selecting the focus area by tapping with your finger, or using pinch and swipe when looking through the photos you've taken.\nAlso: Stanford's holographic AI glasses are coming for your clunky VR headset\nIf you half-press the shutter button, the display momentarily shows the key settings before you fully commit to the shutter release. If you press on the center button of the click-wheel, or dial pad, extra settings come up for the function that's in focus, such as shutter speed.\nStreet photography delight\nThe BF's light weight and simplified user interface made for nice street photography, one of my favorite pastimes.\nI tended to carry the camera at my waist in one hand, holding onto the lens, sometimes with the camera body flipped upside-down, with my pinky finger on the shutter button. That way, I achieved a kind of nonchalant pose that did not draw attention to my picture-taking.\nAlso: I used Google's photo-to-video AI tool on my selfie - and it made me do the tango\nSometimes, I looked at the LCD to see what I was snapping, but oftentimes, I just took a picture in the general direction to see what chance would produce.\nThe autofocus function of the BF was super fast, notably faster than the response time of the fp-L, probably because of the BF's lower-megapixel-count sensor. That made for excellent motion capture, such as this basketball game:\nOne of the BF's shortcomings is having an electronic shutter: Instead of mechanical blades opening and closing, the sensor chip controls in software when the exposure happens. The common knock against an electronic shutter is that it can lead to blurring of fast motion. In the case of the basketball game, in late afternoon daylight, I saw no issue.\nAnother potential drawback is that indoors, in artificial light, the electronic shutter can produce dark bands across the image if the shutter speed is too fast. That can require you to take the picture at a slower shutter speed. In practice, I found it not to be much of a problem.\nImproved electronics\nIn addition to autofocus speed, Sigma has done a very good job with the BF's low-light support, which was already quite good on the fp-L.\nOne of my favorite low-light picture tests is a diorama in the North American mammals hall of the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. This is one of the darkest exhibits in the museum, and it's challenging to photograph if you don't have the camera resting on a tripod to allow for a long exposure.\nAlso: Why ads are coming to your favorite AI bots and you've only got yourself to blame\nTwo taxidermy wolves run on a painted landscape of the Michigan countryside. To the naked eye, the diorama is very, very dark because it is meant to suggest nighttime on the prairie. Here's what it typically looks like, taken with minimal low-light support by the BF:\nMost museum visitors who view the diorama turn on their smartphone camera's flash to take a souvenir shot. But, to my mind, flooding the scene with flash spoils the effect.\nInstead, I cranked up the BF to its highest ISO setting, 102,400 -- fairly high up there for any digital camera. The result is that the wolves emerge in beautiful detail from the darkness -- not as sharp or clean as if the scene were well-lighted, but that's the point:\nIn practice, the BF does a very nice job in darkly lit spaces where you might actually want a picture, such as a jazz club.\nWhen set on a tripod with professional lighting and a backdrop, the BF is also excellent for formal portraits, far better than what you'll get using a smartphone camera for your headshots.\nEven without using a macro lens, the 50mm will allow you to get pretty good closeup shots of something like your favorite toy, from a minimum distance of 18 inches, which you can then crop and still have lots of vivid detail.\nOf course, you could also add a macro lens to the BF and get even closer.\nA gentle introduction to pro features\nSigma has simplified some of the functions for newbies so that the same technical effects are present but in a more inviting fashion. For example, on the Sigma fp-L, a separate button is for \"tone control\" that lets you adjust the light across the scene by degrees for shadows and highlights to make a scene have more or less contrast.\nOn the BF, there's no button for tone control, but when selecting colors with the click-wheel, you can bump up or down values of \"highlight,\" \"shadow,\" and \"fade,\" to alter the degrees of lights and darks. That works in both still images and videos.\nAlso: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out\nThere's also an option called \"look effect,\" where you can dial up or down how vivid or how flat a given color filter is, which is a nice, obvious way to understand making your pictures or videos more striking or more sedate.\nIn practice, the BF does a great job with tone and exposure on automatic. A street scene at sunset, for example, nicely balances the vivid highlights of the sky with the street detail without blown highlights or detail lost in the shadows.\nWhen you review photos, the main LCD display gives you all the information on the tone adjustments you made, which is helpful for determining what works and what doesn't.\nSome things that are typically buried in sub-menus on digital cameras are brought forward in the BF's UI.\nSo, for example, when filming a movie, you have the option to turn on \"constant AF,\" which does a better job of grabbing hold of a new subject entering the frame. That is now an option from the click-wheel rather than being buried as a sub-menu option.\nOf course, there are trade-offs to simplicity. Other functions that were accessed directly via dedicated buttons on digital cameras become things you have to hunt for.\nFor example, auto-exposure lock forces the camera to keep the amount of light in the scene the same as you move it, rather than altering the exposure. This allows you to find the right balance of light and dark and hold onto it while you shift your focus.\nAlso: The 10 apps I can't live or work without - on Windows, Mac, and mobile\nOn the fp-L, auto-exposure lock has its own button. In the BF, you have to move the click wheel to the exposure section of the menus and then turn on auto-exposure lock by tapping on the icon. This extra step is fine if you don't use auto-exposure lock much.\nAnother example is a feature of most digital cameras called fill light, the ability to lighten up dark parts of a picture. On most cameras, you have an option to turn on the fill light while you're taking pictures. On the BF, fill light is something you adjust after the fact by editing the DNG, \"digital negative,\" or \"RAW,\" image in the camera.\nSigma's suggestion overall is to use color and filter adjustments to achieve a similar effect to fill light. In other words, the user interface consolidates traditional operations such as fill light and auto-exposure lock into a simpler set of choices that can be more centrally manipulated.\nAnd some things are just different. On the fp-L, and most cameras, when recording a video, you can take a still image as you're recording. On the BF, if you want a still image as well, you do it when replaying the video, by selecting \"save as JPEG.\"\nHow it performs with video\nSpeaking of video, I found the results were very satisfying. You can take 6K video (6,016 x 3,384) that looks great even without electronic stabilization turned on.\nI took this shot of a woman having her personal photo shoot in front of the Plaza Hotel. Although it's jerky and not cinematic, it was a wonderful spontaneous moment in great quality:\nWhen you turn on the electronic stabilization feature, video is reduced from 6K to \"ultra-high-def\" (3,840 x 2,160) because the camera needs to crop each frame to line up frames and make the shakiness disappear.\nIn a low-light setting, such as this video at Small's jazz club in Greenwich Village, I thought it produced a wonderful-looking film without a tripod.\nHere's where we see an example of the click-wheel at its best. I had the fun of rotating through the different color filters to change up the color from moment to moment while filming, something I would never do when color choices are a single button.\nAlthough my use of the feature is rather gimmicky here, I can see all kinds of possibilities with the click wheel, enabling new ways of controlling the camera during filming.\nLike all cameras, the sound you record with the built-in microphone video is never as good as if you had a dedicated mic attached, especially for something like music. But I thought the result here was very good in a space with challenging acoustics.\nAlso: This hidden Pixel camera setting gave my photos the pop they've been missing\nEven in low light, using the camera hand-held, you can get a nice video like this one taken in a darkened tango hall. In a dark place like a dance hall, with swaying bodies moving to and fro, with the camera in your hand and no stabilization turned on, it can be challenging to capture motion in a way that's satisfying. I love what the BF did with the color and the lights in this scene while managing to shift autofocus from one couple to the next:\nBattery life\nBattery life was fine for my purposes. I got as much as six hours of shooting on a single charge, including intermittent shooting and periods of intense activity. That meant in some cases over 500 exposures in DNG+JPEG format. That's better than the official specification by Sigma for approximately 260 images on a charge. Of course, your results may vary.\nIn my experience, plugging the BF into an iPad via USB-C for forty minutes will charge the camera from zero back to a third of its battery life. You can also bring along a spare battery and swap it in via the latched compartment on the bottom of the BF.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe complaints I've seen about the Sigma BF from seasoned photographers seem to be mostly about the reduction of controls to the click wheel and the mini-LCD. Consolidating controls in that way, they argue, robs the pro photographer of their muscle memory. Some pros also wish the touch screen did more to control the functions rather than just serving as a very good display.\nAlso: I tried Google's new agentic IDE, and it blows away the popular VS Code - here's how\nIn essence, pros have a hard time adjusting to a radically simplified UI. It's a fair point of view, but this is something of a Steve Jobs moment. You have to break a few eggs to make an omelette, and you may have to break habits to reinvent how photography is done.\nI think the BF is a terrific option for a beginning photographer or even an experienced pro. The touch-screen display is intuitive in a smartphone age, the electronics are just as fast as you'd expect based on smartphone picture-taking, and the output is very Instagram-worthy.\nAnd your envious friends will immediately want to know, What is that wild-looking camera you've got?"

One accidental drop, and more often than not, something critical -- usually the display -- decides it's had enough. This leaves you with hefty repair bills, a lot of frustration, and potentially some downtime you didn't plan for.\nAlso: Why your solar-powered power bank isn't as reliable as you think (and what to use instead)\nThis is exactly where ruggedized systems step in to save the day. These devices are purpose-built to withstand the harshest environments and the toughest conditions. And when it comes to ruggedized tablets, they don't get much tougher than the DT Research DT312RP 2-in-1 rugged tablet.\nI've also used it in ways that mimic how ruggedized tablets are typically handled by professionals who rely on them in the field. That means dropping it, placing it on sharp rocks and rubble, covering it in mud, and rinsing it off at the end of the day. Spoiler alert: it handled everything I threw at it like a champ.\nBut before we dive into how it performed, let's take a closer look at what's under the hood of the DT Research DT312RP.\nThe specs and build quality\nDepending on your performance needs, the DT312RP offers two processor options: a 4.6GHz, 10-core Intel Core i5-1335U or a 5GHz, 10-core Intel Core i7-1355U. These are backed by 8GB of RAM and storage options ranging from 512GB to 2TB, giving you plenty of room for data-intensive tasks.\nThe system runs Microsoft Windows 11 IoT Enterprise operating system.\nOne standout feature is that the system is passively cooled, meaning there are no fans. This not only reduces the risk of mechanical failure but also ensures the device remains quiet, even under heavy workloads.\nAlso: I finally found a Windows mini PC powerful enough to replace my desktop (and it's on sale)\nOn the front, you'll find an 11.6-inch, 1920 x 1200 LED-backlit touchscreen display that's sunlight-readable with an impressive 1000 nits of brightness. This makes it perfect for outdoor use, even in bright conditions. The front panel also includes a microphone, speaker, and an array of buttons: a power button, two brightness controls, and five programmable buttons for added customization.\nThe side of the tablet houses various ports, including USB-A, USB-C, gigabit Ethernet, and a DC input. The battery is a hot-swappable 11.4V, 3800mAh unit, with larger battery options available if you need extended runtime.\nOn the back of the unit, there's a kickstand and access panels to swap out the battery and storage. While the top has a robust carry handle, which is perfect for handling the tablet while wearing gloves.\nThe entire system is encased in a durable chassis made from a combination of ABS and polycarbonate polymer and magnesium-aluminum alloy. It measures 8.3 x 12.4 x 0.78 inches (212 x 316 x 20 mm) and weighs 3.43 lbs (1.55 kg). This robust construction allows the tablet to meet IP65, MIL-STD-810H, and MIL-STD-461G certifications, ensuring it can handle dust, water, shocks, and extreme temperatures. Here's a clip of me dropping the tablet from chest-high.\nThe system can be expanded with an optional keyboard, digital pen, batteries, and storage expansions. Camera options include a 5-megapixel front camera, 8-megapixel back camera, 4G LTE/AWS, GPS, and barcode scanner.\nPerformance in the field\nThis is where the DT312RP truly shines. This system is built to endure conditions that wouldn't just break but completely destroy most other devices. The tablet can survive drops, scrapes, and bumps, and it operates flawlessly in temperatures as low as 14\u00b0F (-10\u00b0C) and as high as 149\u00b0F (65\u00b0C).\nDuring my testing, I left it out in the rain and fog, knocked it around on sharp rocks, dropped it repeatedly onto mud and rubble, and even froze it solidly in a freezer. Each time, it powered on without hesitation and performed as if nothing had happened.\nAlso: The best rugged laptops you can buy\nThis level of durability is exactly what you'd expect -- and demand -- from a ruggedized tablet designed for demanding environments that end up in the hands of law enforcement, EMS, or those working in professions such as forestry, auto mechanics, and local and federal government.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe DT Research DT312RP is a ruggedized tablet that doesn't just talk the talk; it totally walks the walk. No matter what your profession, if that demands a device capable of withstanding the elements, this tablet is up to the task. It's tough, reliable, and packed with enough power to handle a wide range of applications.\nBut as you might expect, these tablets are not cheap. The system I tested with the Intel Core i7 and 512GB SSD retails for about $2,100, with the Core i5 version a little cheaper at $1,804.\nSo, if you're weary of fragile devices that can't keep up with you and your work environment, the DT312RP might just be the PC package you've been looking for. This isn't just a tool; it's a partner you can rely on, no matter what you need to do or wherever your job takes you."
