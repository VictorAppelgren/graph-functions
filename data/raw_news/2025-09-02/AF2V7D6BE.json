  "description": "The president\u2019s former national security adviser is warning of a hardening alliance of authoritarian world powers.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s ex-national security adviser has issued a stark warning about America\u2019s future in the global order.\n\nJohn Bolton, who has become one of Trump\u2019s fiercest political foes and was the target of an FBI raid last month, warned Monday that the U.S. was staring down a hardening alliance of authoritarian powers in an op-ed in the Australian Financial Review.\n\nBolton also added India to the bloc of powers, noting the deteriorating relationship between Trump and India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is reportedly ignoring the president\u2019s calls over his decision to impose devastating tariffs on the country.\n\nModi, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping flaunted their bromance at a summit over the weekend by holding hands and standing in a closed circle.\n\nThe geopolitical flirting apparently rankled Trump, who typed out a fuming anti-India Truth Social rant on Monday.\n\nBolton, 76, wrote that \u201cModi is a particularly significant catch for Xi, a leader now shunned by the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nHe argued that China\u2019s military parade marking the 80th anniversary of World War II\u2019s end, with Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jung Un in attendance, is meant to project its \u201cdiplomatic and political clout.\u201d\n\nSlamming former Australian premiers Daniel Andrews and Bob Carr for accepting invitations from Beijing, he wrote, \u201cWe have seen enough such exercises over the past century to understand that more is at stake here than just watching a parade.\u201d\n\nBolton, who previously served as Ambassador to the United Nations under then-President George W. Bush, argued, \u201cThe entire event is intended to rewrite history and advance and normalise both the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s official history and to presage the future.\u201d",

      "text": "India\u2019s Prime Minister has been ignoring President Donald Trump\u2019s calls after the U.S. announced it was moving forward with devastating tariffs on Indian products.\nThe president has tried repeatedly to get Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the phone in the run-up to a 50 percent import tax going into effect Wednesday on products from the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy, The Telegraph reported, citing Japanese and German news sources.\nThe Financial Times confirmed that Modi did not communicate with Trump ahead of the tariff deadline because he was worried the U.S. president would demand last-minute concessions.\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.\nAlready, Trump had imposed a 25 percent duty on products from India. The tax is paid by American companies, with the costs typically passed along to consumers.\nAfter the two countries failed to reach an agreement to lower the levy, Trump announced earlier this month that he was doubling the rate to 50 percent to punish India for buying Russian oil.\n\u201cIndia is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine. Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!\u201d he added\nAfterward he told CNBC, \u201cThey\u2019re fueling the war machine, and if they\u2019re going to do that, then I\u2019m not happy.\u201d\nJust weeks later, Trump invited Vladimir Putin to a peace summit in Alaska, where he fawned over the Russian president and dropped his demands for a ceasefire in Ukraine.\nHe has nevertheless remained tough on India, which has continued to buy Russian crude\u2014albeit at lower levels\u2014despite the tariffs, according to the Financial Times. U.S. trade negotiators had planned to visit New Delhi this week, but the trip was called off.\nThe deterioration in the two countries\u2019 relationship is \u201chead-spinning,\u201d Alyssa Ayres, a former state department official who teaches at George Washington University, told the newspaper.\nTrump and Modi had previously enjoyed a warm relationship, with Modi announcing the dawn of MIGA\u2014for Make India Great Again\u2014during a White House visit in February.\n\u201cWhen America and India work together, that is when it\u2019s MAGA plus MIGA, it becomes MEGA, a mega partnership for prosperity,\u201d he said.\nBut since then, Trump has threatened Apple over its plans to shift some manufacturing to India, mocked the country\u2019s \u201cdead economy,\u201d and made overtures to neighboring Pakistan, with whom India has a complex and at times hostile relationship.\nModi called out Trump in June for taking credit for a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, clarifying that peace talks took place directly between the two rivals, and not through American mediation as Trump had claimed.\nIndia has in turn emerged as one of the hardest-hit countries in Trump\u2019s trade war. Talks stalled in part because New Delhi has refused to pen up the country\u2019s vast agricultural and dairy sectors, according to the Financial Times.\nIn the meantime, Modi\u2019s government has moved to strengthen ties with Russia and China, with the premier traveling to China this weekend for the first time in seven years."

      "text": "Donald Trump is not taking India\u2019s geopolitical flirting well.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin were spotted on Sunday holding hands as they walked into a meeting at a Chinese summit of anti-Western coalition leaders\u2014a show seemingly designed to get under Trump\u2019s skin.\nIt was a clear mission accomplished when the president fumed over America\u2019s \u201cone sided disaster\u201d of a relationship with India in a post on Truth Social.\n\u201cWhat few people understand is that we do very little business with India, but they do a tremendous amount of business with us,\u201d he began. \u201cIn other words, they sell us massive amounts of goods, their biggest \u2018client,\u2019 but we sell them very little - Until now a totally one sided relationship, and it has been for many decades.\u201d\nTrump continued: \u201cThe reason is that India has charged us, until now, such high Tariffs, the most of any country, that our businesses are unable to sell into India. It has been a totally one sided disaster! Also, India buys most of its oil and military products from Russia, very little from the U.S. They have now offered to cut their Tariffs to nothing, but it\u2019s getting late. They should have done so years ago. Just some simple facts for people to ponder!!!\u201d\nPutin, Modi and China\u2019s President Xi Jinping flaunted their bromance at the Shanghai Co-Operation Organization (SCO) summit, hosted by Xi as a means to showcase his vision of a new world order free from the dominance of the United States.\nThe trio shook hands and formed a close circle before being joined by translators at the Tianjin event. All three smiled warmly at one another and, at one point, Modi held both leaders\u2019 hands while letting out an exaggerated laugh. It was a show of unity designed to send a message to their Western counterparts.\nThe White House didn\u2019t immediately respond to request for comment.\nModi\u2019s warmth to the two leaders signals a dramatic shift in U.S.-India relations, as New Delhi\u2019s bureaucracy typically seeks to avoid warmth with Russia and China in an attempt to maintain close ties with Washington.\nIt was less than a year ago that President Joe Biden hailed Modi as a strategic partner and praised U.S.-India ties as \u201cstronger than ever.\u201d\nBut Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff policies on India, which rose to 50 percent when he punished Modi for purchasing sanctioned Russian oil, may have pushed the world\u2019s largest democracy closer to China\u2019s orbit.\nPutin, Xi, and Modi will continue to meet with the 20 world leaders in attendance at the summit over the coming week as they attempt to shore up the support for their new power bloc. The most significant event is scheduled for Tuesday, when the trio is set to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un."

      "text": "In its typically authoritarian way, China (or, more accurately, its Communist Party) is commemorating the 80th anniversary of World War II\u2019s end with a big military parade on September 3. The whole gang will be there to celebrate with Xi Jinping; Vladimir Putin and Kim Jung Un lead the guest list, but most Western nations will send only low-level representatives from their embassies. Nonetheless, Xi is basking in the moment.\nWhy then are former Victorian Labor Premier Daniel Andrews and former NSW Premier and federal Foreign Minister Bob Carr joining the festivities? Perhaps more importantly, are they travelling at the behest of the Albanese government, or with at least its tacit blessing?"
