  "title": "Acura RSX Sneak Peek Reveals Design Clues",
  "description": "Acura, the luxury and performance division of Japanese automaker Honda will display its newest offering: the Acura RSX Prototype. Here's a sneak peek.",
  "content": "This week, Monterey Car Week returns to the California coast. The event has transformed itself from a single race in 1950 into a major automotive event spanning the evolution of cars, from multi-million-dollar mint-condition historic vehicles to futuristic concepts. Acura, the luxury and performance division of Japanese automaker Honda, is marking 10 years at Car Week and will display its newest offering: the Acura RSX Prototype.\n\nWhile we won\u2019t see the whole picture until later this week, we see some familiar cues. Acura\u2019s sleek design language is clear from the sneak peek, continuing the brand\u2019s trajectory toward 2026 and beyond.\n\nBased on the Acura Performance EV Concept that debuted at this time last year, the RSX will be the brand\u2019s first EV developed in house. Notably, it\u2019s also the first EV to be produced at the Honda EV Hub facility in Marysville, Ohio.\n\nThis plant, along with its nearby sibling manufacturing floors in Anna and East Liberty, received a $1 billion infusion of capital to enable Honda and Acura to build internal combustion, hybrid-electric, and battery-electric vehicles on the same production lines. In a market that has shifted back and forth for EVs, hybrids, and ICE in the past year, that flexibility is key.\n\nThe RSX is the first vehicle built on the new line, and the brand plans to manufacture the 0 Saloon and Honda 0 SUV prototypes there as well. A new lightweight, high-strength welding process was unveiled earlier this year, designed to follow Honda\u2019s \u201cthin, light, and wise\u201d strategy.\n\nAcura says the RSX will be not only the first model engineered on the new in-house-developed EV platform, it\u2019s the first on Honda\u2019s ASIMO OS operating system. Introduced at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, the ASIMO OS will \u201cprovide integrated management of electronic control units for automated driving and advanced driver assistance systems, in-vehicle infotainment and other vehicle systems,\" according to the brand.\n\nASIMO, which represents the Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility robot, was born in 2000 and served as a vehicle to advance Honda\u2019s understanding of the connection between humans and machines. This version of ASIMO is not a robot, but an entire operating system for Honda and Acura\u2019s future.\n\n\"The use of the Asimo name pays homage to the beloved Honda Asimo robot and the 'Wise\u2019 value of the Honda 0 Series,\" Honda said in a news release back in January. \"Additionally, Honda announced an agreement with Renesas Electronics Corporation to develop a high-performance system-on-chip, to be introduced on the next generation of 0 Series models in the late 2020s, as well as a new energy service through the Home Energy Management System to enable customers to enjoy a stress-free EV ownership experience with reduced environmental impact.\"\n\nHonda and Acura see ASIMO OS as a way to connect to its customers, as the system will learn RSX owner preferences for a custom driving experience. As artificial intelligence grows in the U.S., ASIMO will fit right in.\n\nThe new Acura RSX will arrive at Acura dealers in the second half of 2026.",

      "text": "Decades ago, my parents bought their first non-GM car: a 1990 Honda Accord. It had a manual transmission, and my mom eventually passed it down to my sister, who kept it for many years before it was retired. I remember my dad telling me that he liked that it was built in America, supporting American workers in Ohio.\nToday, that Marysville, Ohio plant (along with its nearby counterparts in Anna and East Liberty) is in the process of a major transformation to the tune of about $1 billion. By retooling these manufacturing facilities, Honda is poised to build internal combustion, hybrid-electric, and battery-electric vehicles on the same production lines. Ultimately, this adds a level of flexibility to the automaker\u2019s process and the option to adjust each segment up or down as needed.\nHonda\u2019s new \u201cthin, light, and wise\u201d strategy is in full effect in Ohio. The first vehicle built on the new line will be Acura\u2019s new battery-electric RSX SUV later this year, followed by production models of the 0 Saloon and Honda 0 SUV prototypes unveiled at CES in January. Among other firsts, the company has integrated a new lightweight, high-strength welding process that will benefit every car made here.\nChopping the weld current for stronger fusing\nHonda launched its iconic Gold Wing touring motorcycle 50 years ago in Japan. The company moved production to its Marysville plant a few years later, and the facility has been steadily growing ever since the first Accord sedans began rolling off the line in late 1982.\nFast forward to 2025, and Honda is focused on its goal: for 100 percent of its vehicle sales to be the zero-emissions type by 2040. At the same time, Honda (like its rival Toyota) is hedging its bets on ICE and hybrids to meet demand and increase efficiency.\nBy using a special welding technique Honda calls CDC for \u201cconstant DC chopping\u201d, the automaker says its combining two technologies. One maintains a specific waveform with a high peak current and technology that keeps the heat constant by automatically controlling the pause time. In other words, Honda combined the best attributes of conventional DC and AC welding methods for a better result.\nForty-year Honda veteran Tim Leopold is leading the transformation of the Marysville Auto Plant, where more than 4,000 employees show up for work. He says that this kind of welding is new to not just this plant, but for Honda globally. The company hasn\u2019t used this method anywhere else in high volume manufacturing.\nAny kind of spot welding operation requires current and heat in order to create a nugget to fuse the weld together, he explains.\n\u201cThere is no bead; you\u2019re just essentially pinching metal together with what\u2019s called a weld gun, but it\u2019s essentially like a clamp,\u201d Leopold continues. \u201cYou\u2019re squeezing the metal to eliminate any air gaps and then you\u2019re applying a current from one side of the weld tip to the other side of the weld tip.\u201d\nBy \u201cchopping\u201d the current using the CDC method, technicians can control the nugget temperature differently than they might have with DC welding. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with the older process, Leopold says, it\u2019s very difficult to use it when fusing together various-thickness metals. It\u2019s even harder to do with a range of thickness metals in a unique order, which is what Honda is doing at the EV hub.\nThe \u201cold-fashioned style welding\u201d burns through the thinner metal faster because it heats up more quickly but doesn\u2019t allow for full nugget penetration into the thicker metal, Leopold explains, so the weld quality is not as strong. For instance, if two one-millimeter pieces of metal are sandwiched around a three-millimeter piece, that requires a different weld than a consistent-thickness stack. It requires control over the weld nugget temperature so the technicians don\u2019t burn through the thinner one before they get the heat penetration needed for the thicker one, Leopold says.\nGiant megacasting machines move in\nAnother major development for Honda in Ohio is the addition of six 6,000-ton megacasting machines. These units cast, machine, and join battery cases at the Anna engine plant, then the cases are sent to the Marysville auto assembly plant. About an hour or so away, a new battery plant was recently opened to complete the circle. Honda and LG Energy Solution partnered to invest $3.5 billion in the battery facility, and the investment is estimated to total $4.4 billion overall.\nAccording to the North American Die Casting Association, the parts cast on these massive high-pressure machines will be the largest parts Honda has ever produced. Future Honda EVs are expected to incorporate megacasting (sometimes called gigacasting) for other parts as well, like engine and body components.\nThe manufacturer could have built a new plant to house these giant units of equipment, says executive chief engineer of Honda Development & Manufacturing of America Mike Fischer. However, it conserves capital and opens the door for the multiple-powertrain approach. Along with CDC welding technology, line consolidation and space optimization, Honda is calling it a \u201csecond founding\u201d for its Ohio production plants. I can\u2019t wait to see what the upcoming Honda 0 Saloon looks like in production form. It won\u2019t be long before we find out."

      "text": "In America, the Corvette occupies a unique space in our cultural history. From the start, it cast a distinct shadow and established the sports car as an affordable dream. It has carried on for decades as new generations discover and covet this machine. At General Motors\u2019 Advanced Design studios in Pasadena, California, a new vision of an icon has been born. It\u2019s all electric, extremely aerodynamic, and futuristic, and Chevrolet dubbed it the California Corvette.\nThe California Corvette, a sleek carbon tub concept riding on futuristic wheels, was designed with a T-shaped prismatic battery. This enables a lower seating position than the typical, flat skateboard type.\nGM allowed some journalists to experience the interior of the C10 concept via virtual reality headset, which showed an augmented-reality head-up display, adjustable pedals, racecar-worthy seats, a wireless phone charger, and a steering apparatus that is more jet fighter jet than car. Sliding behind the adjustable steering \u201cwheel\u201d requires lifting a single-piece front-hinged canopy.\nExtreme Aerodynamics And A T-Shaped Battery\nLocated in Pasadena, the GM studio is spread out over a 148,000 square-foot campus. Roughly 130 staff work in design, creative, facilities, operations, sculpting, and fabrication, and skilled artisans craft physical clay models.\nThe Advanced Design team invited multiple GM studios in Detroit, Shanghai, Seoul, the UK and Los Angeles to envision Corvette-inspired hypercars. Back in March, the UK studio revealed the first version and the California studio just issued the latest one. From my view, the California studio nailed the spirit of the iconic model with lines that identify it as a Corvette, while the UK studio\u2019s version was more cartoonishly angular.\nBearing a decidedly pronounced rear diffuser and a series of carved-out tunnels for airflow, the California Corvette was imagined as an aerodynamic superstar. Of course, there are elements that might evoke memories of the Batmobile in the Christian Bale versions of the movies, but in silver and red. Bruce Wayne would surely drive this car when he\u2019s not fighting criminals.\n\u201cThe defining design aspect is the single-piece, front-hinged canopy than enables the entire upper shell to be removed, transforming the concept from an agile, slick sports car to a lightweight, open-air track car,\" says Brian Smith, design director, GM Advanced Design Pasadena.\nOnly In Our Dreams\u2026 For Now\nGM says \u201cthere is no production intent behind this design study.\" While this Corvette is not intended for production and may never see the light of day, it\u2019s a design that both evokes the heritage and strength of the model nameplate. This is not representing the C10 generation or any other upcoming generation at this point, GM says; it\u2019s very much a design exercise.\n\u201cWith the current C8 Corvette expected to remain on sale until the end of this decade, that means the California Corvette concept is likely looking out to at least the year 2040,\u201d says Caleb Miller from Car and Driver.\nEven so, the California Corvette is an intriguing look into the future of what a Corvette might look like. I\u2019ll be looking forward to new concepts from the other design studios and even more revelations about what could be."

      "text": "The 2025 Honda Odyssey is in its fifth generation, rolling down the road as a family workhorse, cargo hauler, and road trip superhero since 1995. Every 2025 Odyssey is equipped with a 280-hp V6 engine and 10-speed transmission. You might even be surprised that this minivan includes paddle shifters for those wanting to take a little more control of the gears.\nAvailable in four trim levels\u2014EX-L, Sport-L, Touring, and Elite\u2014the 2025 Odyssey starts at $43,315 and ranges up to $52,275. Honda doesn\u2019t skimp on amenities in the base EX-L model, either: it starts with leather upholstery, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Honda\u2019s \u201cMagic Slide\u201d second-row seats that fold nearly flat, a wireless smartphone charger, and more. At the top of the line, the Odyssey Elite includes ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, an upgraded audio system, and more.\nThis minivan feels lightweight and passes other cars on the highway with ease. It\u2019s like Clark Kent when it\u2019s moseying down the road and turns into Superman, springing into action when you need it. It\u2019s comfortable, roomy, and capable. What makes the difference are little details like these.\nMy 5 Favorite Things about the Honda Odyssey Minivan\n1. Generous Cup Holders\nIt absolutely vexes me to find that so many manufacturers are inserting diagonally-oriented water bottle holders in door pockets. Typically, they fit only a disposable water bottle, at most. That\u2019s not true for the Odyssey, happily, which has extra room. Even the sliding side doors feature a large upright cup holder and third row passengers get space for their beverages as well.\n2. Odyssey\u2019s Streamlined Infotainment Touchscreen\nInfotainment systems that are unnecessarily fussy or complicated can be frustrating when you\u2019re on the road. I like that Honda\u2019s is designed for people of all ages, with a clear way to save satellite radio channel favorites, and navigating back to the home screen requires a quick press of a physical button just left of the screen. It\u2019s space saving and efficient.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\n3. Plenty of Small Storage\nBecause the driver can choose the gears with the push of a button instead of a space-hogging gear shifter, there is room on the floor for a purse or small bag. he side pockets hold more than they appear, and the roll-top console is large enough for snacks, tissues, even diapering supplies.\n4. The Odyssey\u2019s Physical Buttons\nFirst of all, I was thrilled to see an Auto Start/Stop button front and center on my console so I can deactivate this feature. It\u2019s also convenient to find buttons for seat heating and ventilation, climate control, and volume. With so many manufacturers going to all-touchscreen controls, the Odyssey is a unicorn of simplicity.\n5. Configurable Seats and Storage\nMinivans aren\u2019t just for families; small business owners and DIY enthusiasts will find the Odyssey is built for hauling cargo, too. The second and third row fold flat, so you can transport a whole sheet of plywood, bags of mulch, a tray full of plants, furniture, or a whole bunch of pizzas for the band.\nLooking for a minivan to round our your garage? The 2025 Honda Odyssey is a strong choice, whether you have kids or not."

      "text": "Subaru, a brand synonymous with all-wheel drive and adventure, just launched its newest all-electric vehicle with a surprising new option. Available with front-wheel drive, the 2026 Subaru Uncharted EV is the automaker\u2019s first FWD car since 1996. Most importantly, the Uncharted Premium FWD model gets more than 300 miles of range on a full charge. That\u2019s a key metric many customers are looking for, and Subaru is answering the call.\nAt the debut in New York City, Subaru of America director of communications Dominick Infante clarified why the manufacturer decided to switch it up for the Uncharted.\n\"Someone suggested that we were walking away from the EV market, and that\u2019s simply not true,\" Infante said at the event, Road & Track reported. \"We understand that to be successful, we must adapt to current market demands while continuing the push toward hybridization and electrification of our product lineup. That's just smart business.\"\nAs the automotive industry adjusts to whipsawing tariffs and disappearing incentives for EV consumers, Subaru is betting this is a viable answer for the coming years.\nSubaru Uncharted Trim Levels, Explained\nA mechanical twin to Toyota\u2019s new all-electric CH-R, the Uncharted is offered in three flavors: Premium FWD, Sport, and GT.\nThe Premium FWD version is targeted to buyers looking for value. Subaru says it will start at a lower price point; however, it will only be available in limited numbers. At base level, the Uncharted Premium FWD offers 221 horsepower and an estimated range topping 300 miles.\nStepping up the ladder, both the Sport and GT trims are equipped with all-wheel drive, a big boost to 338 horsepower, and up to 290 miles of range. Compared to rival all-electric models like the Hyundai Kona EV and Kia Niro EV, the Subaru comes out on top. Plus, the Uncharted comes with Subaru\u2019s X-Mode, a feature that improves traction and control in low-speed, low-traction situations like icy roads.\nTech Upgrades Inside the Subaru Uncharted Cabin\nRight in the center of the dashboard, a 14-inch touchscreen is standard in all Uncharted models. All the best standard cabin amenities come in pairs, like twin side-by-side wireless smartphone chargers in the front center console, and two USB-C chargers to keep rear seat passengers happy. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also standard.\nPassengers up front will enjoy standard heated seats across all trims, and a heated steering wheel is optional. Choose the GT model to get all the goodies, including ventilated front seats, a panoramic moonroof with a power shade, a Harman Kardon premium audio system, and 20-inch wheels.\nFast charging is available at more than 15,000 Tesla Supercharger stations across the country, and the battery can be refilled from 10 percent to 80 percent in about 30 minutes. That\u2019s true even in cold winter months thanks to the installation of an onboard battery preconditioning system. Owners can also charge up the Uncharted at home on a Level 1 box.\nSubaru prides itself on its EyeSight driver-assistance suite, and it didn\u2019t skimp on the technology in the Uncharted either. Pre-collision braking, front cross traffic alert, blind spot monitors, lane departure alert, emergency stop assist, advanced adaptive cruise control are standard, and a panoramic view monitor, traffic jam assist, and lane change assist are available on upper trim levels.\nPricing for the 2026 Subaru Uncharted has not yet been announced. It will be available for sale starting early next year.\nMORE FROM FORBES"
