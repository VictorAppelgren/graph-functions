  "description": "The 25-year-old is among the options organizational officials are evaluating.",
  "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 The Mets are keeping all options open for a top pitching prospect as they evaluate how he might fit on the major league roster this season.\n\nTo that end, Brandon Sproat was scheduled Sunday to pitch behind an opener for Triple-A Syracuse, giving the right-hander experience entering a game from the bullpen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just part of the development,\u201d manager Carlos Mendoza said at Truist Park. \u201cWe have done it with all of our starters, pretty much. It\u2019s part of the plan, part of the development. I feel like our Triple-A staff does a really good job of preparing these guys in case there\u2019s a need here. And before you know it we need him to pitch out of the bullpen here. It\u2019s kind of in preparation for anything that can happen here.\u201d\n\nThe 25-year-old Sproat, who entered the day with a 2.06 ERA over his previous nine appearances for Syracuse \u2014 he had worked exclusively as a starter \u2014 is among the options organizational officials are evaluating.\n\u2022 CHECK OUT THE LATEST MLB STANDINGS AND METS STATS\n\nAs The Post reported on Saturday, the team in recent days has placed Jonah Tong\u2019s name in the conversation for a potential call-up this season. Tong has not allowed an earned run in his two starts for Syracuse since his promotion from Double-A Binghamton. Overall, he pitched to a 1.43 ERA in 22 starts this season.\n\nTylor Megill is also rehabbing at Syracuse and could soon be an option for the major league staff. The Mets will add a pitcher on Sept. 1 when rosters expand, but also might be proactive beforehand and insert a sixth starter during a stretch of 16 days with a game scheduled.\n\nThe Mets injected youth into their rotation last weekend, when Nolan McLean was called up to join the rotation. McLean has provided two strong starts for the team since his arrival and is scheduled to face the Phillies on Wednesday at Citi Field.",

      "text": "Access the Mets beat like never before\nJoin Post Sports+ for exciting subscriber-only features, including real-time texting with Mike Puma about the inside buzz on the Mets.\nTry it freeATLANTA \u2014 Brett Baty has the simplest of explanations for his success at the plate over the last several weeks.\n\u201cI just feel like I am putting together really good at-bats and hitting the ball hard right now,\u201d Baty said before going 0-for-4 with two strikeouts and a walk in a rare off night in Saturday\u2019s 9-2 win over the Braves.\nBut Mets officials have seen growth from the 25-year-old infielder, with his emergence as a confident and capable player for a team firmly in the postseason hunt.\nIt serves as another reminder that success isn\u2019t always linear.\nBaty entered Saturday with a .310/.372/.548 slash line with six homers since the All-Star break.\nOne of his best major league performances occurred a night earlier, when he finished 4-for-6 in the team\u2019s victory over the Braves.\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s just a matter of him growing up,\u201d said Jeremy Barnes, one of the team\u2019s two hitting coaches.\nBarnes noted the focus Baty put on his swing during the offseason, with an emphasis on reducing his ground-ball rate and initiating contact in front of the plate.\nBaty\u2019s metrics suggest there is still room for improvement in reducing strikeouts and increasing walks, but his bat speed, hard-hit ball percentage and exit velocity are all well above the MLB average.\nBarnes sees a player most comfortable hitting to both gaps, but also capable of pulling a pitch over the fence.\n- CHECK OUT THE LATEST MLB STANDINGS AND METS STATS\n\u201cWe want him to hit the ball hard, and he\u2019s learned that catching the ball out in front doesn\u2019t necessarily mean catching the ball way out in front of the plate,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cIt means just catching the ball more out in front of his body. That gives him a little bit more time, and it\u2019s just a matter of, \u2018I have been here, done this, I have hundreds of at-bats under my belt,\u2019 and through that experience you kind of have that trial and error type thing and figure out what is working for you mentally.\u201d\nBaty, according to Barnes, has begun to display a \u201cquiet confidence\u201d that suggests he knows he belongs in a major league uniform.\nBaty has bounced between Triple-A Syracuse and the Mets for the last three seasons.\n\u201cYou can just see it in his eyes,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cWhen you are talking to a young kid who is a little bit overwhelmed, you can just see it and feel it when you are interacting with him. There is just this quiet confidence of, \u2018I know who I am and I know I belong here.\u2019 That is hard to get. It\u2019s hard to get as a coach. I can only imagine how hard it is to get as a player.\n\u201cYou are in New York, there is this spotlight on you and you are surrounded by these superstars that we have had, and if it\u2019s not going your way it\u2019s easy for doubt to creep in and these stories you spin in your head, that is normal. But he\u2019s gotten over that and I think he knows he belongs.\u201d\nThe Mets have needed the jolt, especially after a prolonged stretch in which the bottom of the lineup failed to produce.\nBaty was part of that problem earlier in the season, but lately has helped to carry the lineup.\n\u201cFor us to get to where we want to go, it just can\u2019t be on [Francisco] Lindor, [Juan] Soto and [Pete] Alonso, on their shoulders,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAdd [Brandon] Nimmo into that category, also. But we need to have [Francisco] Alvarez healthy and hitting, we need [Mark] Vientos to contribute, Baty to contribute, [Jeff] McNeil continuing to be who McNeil is. To get where we want to go we, need a one-through-nine lineup that is able to make a difference.\u201d"

      "text": "Access the Mets beat like never before\nJoin Post Sports+ for exciting subscriber-only features, including real-time texting with Mike Puma about the inside buzz on the Mets.\nTry it freeATLANTA \u2014 The newest Mets starting pitcher may have provided a tutorial for many of his rotation mates.\nFact: It\u2019s not a crime to pitch six innings or more.\nClay Holmes on Saturday followed the example set by rookie Nolan McLean a night earlier and threw strikes, inducing early contact. The result was a second straight outing into the seventh inning for a Mets starting pitcher \u2014 still not a world record, according to Guinness, but noteworthy enough given the manner this season has proceeded for the team\u2019s rotation.\nIn his longest start in almost three months, Holmes helped deliver a 9-2 victory over the Braves at Truist Park that gave the Mets a second straight win and fifth in their last seven games.\nSix homers carried the Mets\u2019 offensive attack: Mark Vientos and Jeff McNeil each hit two, and Pete Alonso and Starling Marte delivered one apiece.\nThree of the Mets\u2019 blasts were hit in the seventh inning to extend a one-run lead. The outburst gave the Mets 29 homers in their last 11 games.\nThe Mets remained six games behind Philadelphia for first place in the NL East. They extended their lead to 2 \u00bd games on Cincinnati for the NL\u2019s third and final wild-card berth.\nHolmes, who before McLean\u2019s seven-inning gem Friday, was the last Mets pitcher other than David Peterson to complete six frames in a start (that occurred June 7) started and finished strong on this night. Overall, he lasted 6 \u00b9/\u2083 innings and allowed two earned runs on three hits with four strikeouts and two walks.\n\u201cYou have one guy kind of do something and break through, and I think people can feed off that and the game is contagious,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s us trying to go out and do more. I think it\u2019s that we\u2019re in a spot where we can trust ourselves, and there is a healthy competition, and let\u2019s go out and be our best.\u201d\nMarte, in addition to going deep, helped spark the team on the bases and with his arm. The 36-year-old outfielder stole two bases and threw out a runner at the plate as the starting left fielder.\n- CHECK OUT THE LATEST MLB STANDINGS AND METS STATS\n\u201cIt feels good the way we have been playing the last two nights,\u201d Marte said through an interpreter. \u201cWe have been taking a lot of pitches but also taking advantage of the pitchers\u2019 mistakes. We are being aggressive on the base paths and on pitches in the zone.\u201d\nMcNeil, back in the lineup after a two-game absence with right shoulder discomfort, launched a three-run homer in the third inning that gave the Mets a 3-0 lead.\nMcNeil smashed a first-pitch cutter from Cal Quantrill just inside the right field foul pole for his 11th homer this season.\nMarte\u2019s arm saved a run in the bottom of the inning. Jurickson Profar hit a fly to medium left field, on which Nacho Alvarez Jr. tagged up at third base. Marte, starting in left with Brandon Nimmo sidelined by neck stiffness, unleashed a perfect throw home to nail Alvarez for the final out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a huge momentum boost,\u201d Holmes said.\nHolmes walked Matt Olson and Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. to begin the fourth and both runners scored.\nAcu\u00f1a was safe at second \u2014 the Braves won a replay challenge \u2014 on Michael Harris II\u2019s grounder to McNeil, loading the bases before Marcell Ozuna\u2019s sacrifice fly brought in Atlanta\u2019s first run.\nDrake Baldwin\u2019s ensuing squib between the plate and pitcher\u2019s mound (Holmes\u2019 only play was to first base) scored Acu\u00f1a and sliced the Mets\u2019 lead to 3-2.\nHolmes received a boost in the sixth from Tyrone Taylor, whose full extension dive in center field robbed Harris of a hit for the final out in the inning.\nAlonso and Vientos homered in consecutive at-bats in the seventh, extending the Mets\u2019 lead to 6-2. Then, after McNeil was retired, Marte hit the Mets\u2019 third homer of the inning.\nVientos went deep again in the ninth, giving him four homers in his last six games. McNeil followed with his second homer of the night.\n\u201cWe have got a chance to sweep these guys [Sunday],\u201d manager Carlos Mendoza said. \u201cThat is the mentality. It\u2019s good to come in here after a couple of tough losses [in Washington] to bounce back and play well.\u201d"
