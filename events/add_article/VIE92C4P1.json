      "summary": "Deere & Co. shares fell significantly as the company lowered its annual earnings outlook due to decreased grain prices affecting farmer spending, influenced by a larger-than-expected corn harvest and reduced demand for soybeans amid trade tensions. Tapestry's stock also dropped sharply, primarily due to tariff impacts and underperformance of its Kate Spade brand, leading to an $855 million write-down, despite its Coach brand performing well. In contrast, Bullish shares surged following a successful $1.1 billion IPO.",
