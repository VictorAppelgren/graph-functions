  "content": "Pete Alonso solidified his place in Mets history Tuesday, and Gary Cohen punctuated the moment by describing it as \u201cthe Polar bear on his own private iceberg\u201d during his historic home run call on SNY.\n\nAlonso surpassed Darryl Strawberry with his franchise-record 253rd home run during Tuesday night\u2019s game against the Braves at Citi Field.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s outta here, outta here!\u201d Cohen, the Mets\u2019 TV play-by-play man, exclaimed as the ball sailed over the right-center field fence. \u201cPete Alonso stands alone. The Polar Bear on his own private iceberg. Pete Alonso, the most prolific home run hitter in New York Mets history.\u201d\n\nThe Citi Field crowd roared as Alonso celebrated the milestone and waved to the fans after he embraced Brandon Nimmo and Jeff McNeil.\n\nThe SNY broadcasters allowed the moment to play out with the crowd noise doing the talking after Cohen\u2019s initial call.\n\nOn the radio, Keith Raad was on the mic as Alonso hit his third-inning homer to put the Mets ahead 5-1.\n\n\u201cIt is gone! A missile into right center field,\u201d Raad said. \u201cA two-run home run and history. Number 253 for Pete Alonso. All alone as the franchise leader in home runs.\u201d\n\nBroadcaster Howie Rose has been synonymous with some of the franchise\u2019s biggest moments, but was not on the call on Tuesday.\n\nIn a post on X, he praised Raad\u2019s radio call.\n\n\u201cThis one is splendid with many more to come. I\u2019m thrilled he has this slice of Mets broadcast history,\u201d Rose wrote.\n\nAlonso had been chasing Strawberry\u2019s record and tied it on Saturday in the Mets\u2019 7-4 loss to the Brewers.\n\nThe slugger added a second home run Tuesday, a solo shot in the sixth inning.\n\nAlonso is in the middle of his seventh season with the Mets after getting drafted out of the University of Florida in the second round of the 2016 MLB Draft.",

She handled and managed the game very well. And big day for her. Big day for Major League Baseball. I congratulated her again on that because it\u2019s quite the accomplishment.\u201d\nPawol, 48, is a West Milford, N.J., native who played softball at Hofstra. She has more than 1,200 minor league games on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 across the last 10 seasons.\nShe received support from Braves fans in Atlanta when she made history on Saturday.\n\u201cIt was amazing when we took the field,\u201d Pawol said. \u201cIt seemed like quite a few people were clapping and calling my name. That was pretty intense and emotional.\u201d\nPawol worked first base during the first game of Saturday\u2019s doubleheader and third base for the second game.\n\u201cShe did a good job,\u201d Braves manager Brian Snitker said Saturday. \u201cYou can tell she knows what she does.\u201d\nPawol is a rover called up from the minors, so her next MLB assignment is unclear."
