  "description": "The home was used for exterior shots in several seasons as the Wheeler's house.",
  "content": "An instantly-recognizable home for fans of Netflix's hit show \"Stranger Things\" has been listed for sale in Atlanta for $350,000. The house at 2530 Piney Wood Lane in Atlanta, Georgia\u2014famous for being featured in the Netflix show \"Stranger Things\"\u2014is for sale.\n\nThe five-bedroom, three-bath home at 2530 Piney Wood Lane was used for exterior shots of the Wheeler family home in \u201cStranger Things,\u201d where characters Mike Wheeler and his sisters, Nancy and Holly, lived with their parents, Karen and Ted. The exterior was used for scenes across several seasons, including as the go-to meeting spot for sessions of Dungeons & Dragons between Mike and his friends, and where police grilled Lucas, Dustin and Max Mayfield (Sadie Sink) in season 4. The 2,466-square-foot home on two acres is described in the listing, held by Atlanta Fine Homes Sotheby's International Realty, as a \"quintessential 80s time capsule\" with \"incredible restoration opportunity.\" The two-story home, built in 1963, is complete with wood paneling, a floral kitchen wallpaper border and a brick fireplace. The house hitting the market comes almost a year after the fifth and final season of \u201cStranger Things\u201d wrapped filming.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines.

Kris Jenner listed her home, which featured heavily in \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians,\" for $13.5 million earlier this year. A sprawling oceanside estate that was used as a filming location in the 1992 film \"Basic Instinct\" and in season 2 of the HBO Series \"Big Little Lies\" hit the market for $91 million last month. The New York City home used as Holly Golightly's home in the 1961 film \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" is currently listed for $15 million.",

That's the current sales record in Indiana, which was set by a 41,762-square-foot mansion on 168 acres that included a 35-acre lake. The seven-bedroom, 17 bathroom house was reportedly inspired by the Villa la Rotonda in Italy and Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Monticello. It belonged to late businesswoman Christel DeHaan.\nKey Background\nJames (Jim) Irsay died in May at age 65 and with an estimated net worth of $4.8 billion. His father, Robert Irsay, bought the Indianapolis Colts football team in 1972 and Jim grew up living with the team during summer camp and traveling on the team bus. He worked in everything from ticket sales to public relations before being named general manager in 1984, at 24, and inheriting the team as 100% owner in 1997. The Colts\u2019 record improved dramatically under Jim Irsay, resulting in a 2007 Super Bowl victory and 10 division titles during his tenure.\nForbes Valuation\nThe Colts are ranked as No. 26 on Forbes' list of the most valuable NFL teams in 2025, with $593 million in revenue, up 23% from the year before. The team is now owned by Irsay's three daughters: Carlie Irsay-Gordon, Casey Foyt, and Kalen Jackson."

      "text": "A sprawling oceanside estate with a Hollywood history has been listed for sale at $91 million in Carmel, California and will break a local sales record once held by actor Brad Pitt if it fetches its asking price.\nCalled Seacliff, the compound is a collection of five parcels on Spindrift Road near Monterey and includes six structures: A 12,441-square-foot main house, four smaller \"cottages\" and a new, one-bedroom residence, according to its listing website. The main house has eight bedrooms, nine bathrooms, 11 fireplaces and three kitchens, and was featured as Sharon Stone\u2019s house in the 1992 film \"Basic Instinct\" and was the settling for the couples therapy scene between Madeline and Ed MacKenzie in Season 2 of the HBO Series \"Big Little Lies.\u201d\nDubbed \"The Lodge,\" the home also has an art deco library, chef's kitchen with wine refrigerators for 500 bottles, a four-car garage, commercial fitness center and spa with an indoor dry sauna, steam room, pool, three hot tubs, outdoor dry-sauna and cold plunge.\nThere are four smaller cottages on the property that boast six oversized fireplaces made with one-of-a-kind sculptural stones brought to California from Montana over the course of three years, and a newer one-bedroom residence.\nThe compound totals 5.35 acres with cliffside views of the Pacific Ocean and the property also includes two stand-alone garages, an 8-foot-tall stone privacy wall, a Japanese Zen garden, a manicured garden with waterscapes and Koi pond, a mature Cypress forest, a greenhouse and three stairwells accessing the coastline below.\nWho is selling Seacliff?\nThe home is being sold by software entrepreneur Gary Vickers, who founded and later sold P2 Energy Solutions, and his wife, Kerry Vickers. The couple purchased the main house from the estate of Steve Fossett, a financier and aviator who was the first person to fly around the world alone in a balloon. The Vickers went on to expand the property by buying neighboring lots and built the compound's cottages for family use. Gary Vickers has said he is selling the property to downsize and travel with family, but that \"my crowning achievement will always be the uncompromising realization of Seacliff.\" The compound was listed for $52 million in 2019 but did not sell, and the Vickers subsequently remodeled the main house, built a new one-bedroom residence and made landscaping improvements, according to Coldwell Banker Real Estate.\nCould Break Sales Recored Set By Brad Pitt\nIf it sells for its asking price, Seacliff will break a sales record for the Carmel, California area, according to Coldwell, once held by actor Brad Pitt. He spent $40 million on an early 20th-century home in the Carmel Highlands in 2022. Other famous residents of the area have included Betty White, Doris Day and Clint Eastwood, who served as mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea for two years in the 1980s.\nHere\u2019s How Exclusive The Area Is\nSeacliff is located in Carmel Highlands, about 5 miles south of Carmel-By-The-Sea, which is consistently listed among the most expensive zip codes in the United States. The town is a walkable community of restaurants, hotels and art galleries, and its homes have a median price of $2,015 per square foot, almost 10 times more than the median listing price per square foot nationwide as of July, according to the Federal Reserve. The Carmel-by-the-Sea zip code of 93921 was ranked as the 30th most expensive in the nation last year by real estate platform PropertyShark and 93923, the zip code of Seacliff, was listed at No. 70."
