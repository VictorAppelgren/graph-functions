      "summary": "Marvell Technologies shares plunged 18% after a Q2 earnings miss, with data‑center sales and revenue outlook below consensus. The drop contrasts sharply with Nvidia’s strong AI‑driven results, underscoring that AI spending remains robust but Marvell’s growth is lagging. Analysts warn that without clearer long‑term AI fundamentals and design‑win visibility, the company may struggle to regain investor confidence. Bank of America has downgraded Marvell to a neutral rating amid these concerns.",
