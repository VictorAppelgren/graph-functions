      "feedback": "Your Movers & Scenarios nearly meet format but need a clean, evidence-grounded rewrite: transform to exactly four lines, two Up and two Down, each line in the exact order Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %, and ground every fact or number in the SOURCE MATERIAL with inline IDs only where you assert a fact. Remove the Alt 1/Alt 2 blocks and the long Outlook in the movers; place a single Outlook line (1 line preferred) if the asset is not tradable, or a Swing Trade line (1 line max, or 2 if needed) only for a tradable instrument. For the four movers, pick discrete, citable drivers from the material and keep time windows strictly to 0–6 weeks, 0–3 weeks, 4–6 months, and 4–6 months. Example structure you can adopt: Up | 0–6 weeks | Policy momentum via the Big Beautiful Bill and AI productivity uplift | Watch pace of bill passage and measurable AI milestones; evidence: ~$4.4T tax-cut path and 1–1.5% productivity uplift | 40–50% (EPJYXB7DX)(UPV3X2MQ6); Down | 0–3 weeks | Tariff-driven auto pricing drag | Watch CPI autos component and any tariff rhetoric; pass-through signals in autos; evidence: easing tariffs on Japanese autos with mixed pass-through and Toyota NA loss | 25–40% (S15934PBQ); Up | 4–6 months | UNH/LULU moats and premium valuations amid Regime 4 tilt; watch UNH/LULU profitability, Ford EV trajectory | evidence: UNH FCF yield >9%, LULU ~13.5x forward, Ford EV losses | 25–35% (IGP1Q4ZEJ)(W2622L6WW); Down | 4–6 months | Ford EV profitability deterioration reprices autos; watch EV economics and auto-cycle demand | evidence: Q2 EV loss, auto-margin risk | 25–35% (W2622L6WW). Do not mix in unrelated alt narratives or extraneous lines within the four movers. Ensure each line cites only facts you intend to assert; keep probabilities as ranges anchored to the material (e.g., 25–40% or 40–50%), not an unanchored single percent. For the Trade/Outlook Plan, treat the instrument as not clearly tradable if you cannot specify a single clean swing setup; output a concise Outlook line (Direction | Horizon | Expected path/levels | Decision signals | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence %) such as: OutLOOK | 0–12 months | Base case: inflation/rates normalize with EV transition as a swing factor; softer dollar and AI-driven capex lift risk assets | Trigger: policy milestones and AI milestones; Invalidation: sharper tariff escalation or debt shock | Probability 60% | Confidence 75%. Ensure all technical triggers map to explicit source IDs and avoid duplicating facts across lines; this will give a world-class, first-principles, scenario-driven Swing Trade/Oulook that cleanly adheres to the 4-line mover constraint, uses evidence-backed probabilities, and stays fully anchored in the provided material.",
