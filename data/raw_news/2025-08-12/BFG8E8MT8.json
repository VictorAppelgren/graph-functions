  "content": "The 'bowl market' is over after Cava, Sweetgreen, and Chipotle's disappointing earnings originally appeared on TheStreet.\n\nThe 'bowl market' is over. Long live the bowl.\n\nAfter disappointing back-to-back earnings seasons, Chipotle (CMG) , Cava Group (CAVA) , and sweetgreen (SG) are running into a wall of expectations. On one side, hungry fast casual shoppers, fed up with the high price of bowls and shrinking portions. And on the other side, investors who had grown accustomed to their fantastical growth.\n\nAll three had spent 2023 and 2024 on the rise, with successive strong earnings reports sending their stocks to new heights. But now, it's a different story, as 'one off' bad quarters for Chipotle and sweetgreen are turning into a trend, pressing 'reset' on investor expectations.\n\nIn Q2, Chipotle reported a 4% year-over-year decline in its same-store sales and cut its guidance. Sweetgreen followed with a 7.6% YoY decline in same-store sales and weaker guidance. After their respective reports, their stocks are down 28% and 69% year-to-date.\n\nEven Cava, which made a strong first quarter showing, is feeling the drag too. On Tuesday, it reported that its same-store sales rose only 2.1% in the quarter. That's better than the decline seen by its competition, but about a third as much as analysts polled by StreetAccount were looking forward.\n\nAfter its report today, its stock is down 20% in after hours trading. Before then, it was like Chipotle, down 26% this year. Tomorrow, the way it's shaping up, its YTD return might well end up being a stepping stone between the giant Chipotle and smaller Sweetgreen in terms of stock losses.\n\nLess for More\n\nThere's a lot of reasons ascribed to the decline in same-store sales at fast-casual chains. Chief among them might be a consumer recession. That is, that consumers are spending less money eating out and restricting spend on value-oriented purchases.\n\nHowever, there's another factor that's at play: that consumers feel they're getting less for more. Chipotle has been at the center of a years-long speculation over smaller portions and higher prices on its once-beloved burrito bowls. And, to a lesser extent, Sweetgreen has faced similar pressures as the price of its salads have risen.\n\nIn response, the companies are seeking to launch a 'value' blitz. Chipotle said last year that it hadn't changed its portion sizes, but it pledged to increase them amid complaints. After its Q2 earnings, Sweetgreen similarly promised to increase portions, promising 25% more protein in its salads and bowls, while expanding its 'budget' menu options.",

      "text": "In this article:\nSalad chain sweetgreen is making big changes to its menu to win back customers originally appeared on TheStreet.\nPost-pandemic darling sweetgreen was once touted by its boosters as the \"next Chipotle.\" Nearly four years after its public debut, it's going hungry on Wall Street.\nThe fast casual salad chain \u2014 which predominately operates in affluent metros like Los Angeles, New York City, and Chicago \u2014 is down more than 82% since its Nov. 2021 debut, with its 300%+ rally coming undone amid slowing sales and a still-unprofitable business.\nIts 300% rally, which made it a hot commodity among traders last year, was made possible by fantastic growth. The company's same-store revenue rose 9.3% year-over-year in Q2 2024, which was helping to improve the company's losses.\nHowever, all its progress has come undone. In the first quarter of 2025, the company downgraded its outlook for the year, blaming the LA Wildfires for its poor performance. For that, its stock sank, but investors gave it a pass.\nHowever, as declining reviews among a cropping of nationwide sweetgreen locations showed, it wasn't just the weather driving away affluent urbanites. It might well have been the $17 salads. In Q2 2025, same-store sales fell off a cliff, declining 7.6% year-over-year. As a result, it cut its growth outlook for the year for a second time.\nThings are going the wrong way for the one-time retail darling. As a result, it's pulling out the stops to stop the business from unfolding.\nMore Bowl for your Buck\nIn response to the steep decline in same-store sales, sweetgreen sent out an email blast to customers on Friday, committing to increase the amount of protein in its bowls and salads, likely a means to win back customers who have shrugged off the brand.\nA company representative told TheStreet that, \"We remain focused on strengthening our value proposition, and have increased our chicken and tofu portioning by 25%.\" They say that guest satisfaction has increased in response to the larger portions.\nSome of that approximation has been made possible by the company's Infinite Kitchen robot, which has turned new locations into a high-throughput assembly line for salads and bowls with the help of human workers.\nHowever, the macros on sweetgreen's web menu have not been updated to reflect the larger portions of protein, so we'll have to wait and see how this is applied in practice.\nIndependent of improving its perceived value, the company plans to continue pushing its discounted $13 Bowl of the Week, which drops every Monday for its Sweetpass Rewards members.

The company has 10,300 employees.\nRatingPrice TargetShopping Report Some of the country's biggest retailers report this\nShopping Report Some of the country's biggest retailers report this week and multiple Federal Reserve officials will take to the podium, including Chairman Powell. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 3.4%, the S&P 500 rose 5.3%, and the Nasdaq was up 7.2%. For the year to date, the DJIA and the S&P 500 have turned positive, up 0.3% and 1.3%, respectively. The Nasdaq, down 0.5%, is close to moving into the green. Earnings season is winding down. The list of reports this week includes Palo Alto Networks on Tuesday; Target, TJX, Lowe's, and Zoom Communications on Wednesday; Intuit, Analog Devices, Williams-Sonoma, and Ralph Lauren on Thursday; and Nordstrom on Friday. Some 92% of S&P 500 companies have reported, and earnings for the quarter are up 14% from the prior-year quarter. That is far above the consensus call for EPS growth of about 3%-8% and follows 17% growth in 4Q24 EPS and 9% growth in 3Q24, according to LSEG. For 1Q, Healthcare is the leading sector, up 46%, and Energy is at the bottom, down 17%. For all of 2025, the Argus full-year earnings estimate is for low-double-digit growth from 2024. On the economic calendar, Existing Homes Sales are due out on Thursday and New Home Sales on Friday. As well, multiple Fed officials will speak publicly. The Economic Call of the Week from Argus' Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, is for growth in home prices to slow further. Prices of new and existing homes are reported along with home sales. On Thursday, the National Association of Realtors will report existing home sales for April. We expect sales of 4.1 million homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. On Friday, the Department of Housing and Urban Development will report new home sales for April. We expect sales of 650,000 homes at an annual rate. In March, the 'months supply' of existing homes rose to a still-healthy 4.0 months from 3.5 in February, though growth in existing home prices eased to 2.7% from 3.4% on a year-over-year basis. In the new home market, supply declined to 8.3 months in March from 8.9 in February, but prices slumped 2.9%. The Zillow Home Value Index for all homes rose 1.4% in April, compared with 2.6% in January, this as mortgage rates near 7% strain affordability. For other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure forecasts 2.4% for 2Q. This follows the surprise decline of 0.3% for 1Q GDP. The Argus 2025 GDP growth estimate has been lowered to 0.5% from 1.3%. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast forecasts a 2.4% rate for CPI in May, higher than the April rate. Mortgage rates inched higher last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.81%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices ticked down three cents to an average of $3.12 per gallon for regular gas. Looking ahead, the next Fed rate decision is on June 18, with odds at 9% for a rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. The next meeting after that is on July 30, when odds jump to 33% for a cut.\nRecent weakness provides buying opportunity\nCAVA Group, Inc., founded in 2006, owns and operates a chain of Mediterranean restaurants. The company has 10,300 employees.\nRatingPrice TargetLast week, we commented that corporate insiders had little time to react to\nLast week, we commented that corporate insiders had little time to react to the tariff-induced plunge in stock prices that took place at the very end of the April 4 trading week. But that is old news, as a suspension of tariffs on April 9 sent stocks soaring, a pullback was evident on April 10, optimism kicked in on April 11, and tariffs were modified for many technology products over the weekend. Traders reacting to the daily news flow likely have unprecedented whiplash. But so do most other investors, insiders included. But as we said above, current weekly insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research (complied before the weekend action on technology products) has morphed, and the change is exceedingly bullish. On a scale where any ratio below 2.00 is bullish, the neutral range runs from 2.00 to 6.00, and anything above 6.00 is bearish, Vickers' Total One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 1.31 (versus 2.72 last week). Drilling down to exchanges, the NYSE One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 0.95, versus 2.14, and the Nasdaq One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 1.99, versus 3.35. For comparison, the last time Vickers' one-week data was this bullish was in November of 2023. On a sector basis, insider buying exceeded selling in Consumer Discretionary last week, with shares valued at $38 million bought versus $1.5 million sold. Buying was also notable in Healthcare, as shares valued at $18 million were bought versus $10 million sold, as well as in Financials, Real Estate, and Energy. Selling was the greatest in Industrials over the last week, with shares valued at $28 million sold versus $14 million bought, as well as in Information Technology, Utilities, and Consumer Staples (though the volume of transactions in many of these sectors was low). This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Sinclair Inc. (NGS: SBGI) and Williams-Sonoma Inc. (NYSE: WSM)."
