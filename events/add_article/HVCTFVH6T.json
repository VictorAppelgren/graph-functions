Maduro dismissed U.S. claims, declared Venezuela’s sovereignty intact, and announced a massive militia mobilization. Meanwhile, the U.S. officially recognized opposition candidate Edmundo González as president-elect, a move that Venezuela rejects, and China continues to defend its economic and diplomatic ties with Caracas amid escalating tensions.",
