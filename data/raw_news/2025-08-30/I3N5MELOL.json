  "title": "Saturday\u2019s Powerball Jackpot Swells To $1B As Lottery Fever Spreads In CA",
  "description": "Californians have won the majority of the nation's $1 billion jackpots. What are the odds it could happen again on Saturday?",
  "content": "CALIFORNIA, CA \u2014 Yes, the odds are against California Powerball players claiming the estimated $1 billion jackpot in Saturday\u2019s drawing, but four winners of the only six $1 billion jackpots in history were from the Golden State. The grand prize, which swelled from an earlier estimated $950 million, is generating a flurry of ticket sales.\n\nThe $1 billion jackpot has an estimated cash value of $453.1 million. Saturday\u2019s jackpot ranks as the game\u2019s sixth-largest prize and the biggest advertised jackpot in more than a year. The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million, while the odds of winning any prize are much less at 1 in 24.9.\n\nIn Wednesday's drawing, there was no jackpot winner in California, but there were 328,134 winning tickets, according to the California Lottery.\n\n If you want to test your luck, Powerball vendors in California are found on the California Lottery website. Tickets must be purchased by 7 p.m. PT to be considered in Saturday\u2019s drawing at 10:59 p.m. ET.\n\nThe jackpot climbed again after no player matched the winning numbers Wednesday: white balls 9, 12, 22, 41, 61 and red Powerball 25. The Power Play multiplier was 4. Six tickets won prizes worth $1 million or more in Wednesday\u2019s Powerball drawing, after matching all five white balls. The $1 million-winning tickets were sold in Arizona, New York and Virginia. Three tickets in Mississippi, Ohio and Virginia increased their winnings to $2 million by including the Power Play option for $1 more.\n\nIn the Double Play drawing, a ticket in South Dakota won a $500,000 prize after matching all five black balls. Double Play is a $1 add-on feature that allows players to play their Powerball numbers again, in a separate drawing for a chance to win up to $10 million. Double Play drawings are live-streamed on Powerball.com after the main drawing.",

It would be the state's largest unclaimed jackpot in history.\nSome lucky but possibly clueless SuperLotto Plus winner who purchased the winning ticket in Chatsworth is running out of time to collect their millions.\nWhile the world waits breathlessly for this month\u2019s mystery Chino Hills Powerball Jackpot winner to come forward and collect his or her $528.8 million, another, albeit smaller, lottery fortune is slipping away.\nA winning SuperLotto Plus ticket worth $63 million was purchased in Chatsworth on Aug. 8. The winner has yet to come forward to collect the prize, and the 180-day deadline to collect is fast approaching. The ticket holder has until 5 p.m. Feb. 4 to collect. The closest lottery office to where the ticket was sold is the Van Nuys District Office located at 16525 Sherman Way in Van Nuys.\nFind out what's happening in Northridge-Chatsworthfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d said California Lottery spokeswoman Donna Cordova. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s gone on this long.\u201d\nJackpots have gone unclaimed before, but never to this magnitude, she said. The highest unclaimed California Lottery prize was a $28.5 million SuperLotto Plus ticket sold in San Lorenzo (Alameda County) back on September 10, 2003.\nFind out what's happening in Northridge-Chatsworthfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nIf the $63 million winner comes forward and takes the lump sum, they will receive a one-time payout of $39.9 million before federal taxes. Otherwise, the $63 million will be spread out over 30 years. If this prize is never claimed, the money will go to support California public schools.\nThe Chatsworth winning ticket was bought at the 7-Eleven located at 20871 Lassen Street. The winning numbers are 46-1-33-30-16, and the Mega number is 24.\n\u201cThe Lottery will not know who the winner is until they claim their prize,\u201d according to a California Lottery written release. \u201cSo check your wallet, your purse, the glove box, the kitchen junk drawer\u2026anywhere you keep your tickets.

      "text": "Business & Tech\nWhat Happens To Unclaimed Lottery Jackpots In CA\nWith an unclaimed $200M jackpot about to expire, Patch found out where all the money goes and how often players leave millions on the table.\nLOS ANGELES, CA \u2014 A $200 million lottery jackpot is hours from expiring unclaimed in Southern California, and that would make Golden State public schools the big winner.\nIf the owner of the $197.5 million ticket sold at an Encino gas station last year doesn't come forward by Saturday, all that money will go to the school system. While it would be a record haul, smaller jackpots and lottery winnings go unclaimed all the time, raising millions for education.\nEvery year, there are tens of millions of dollars that go unclaimed among all the lotteries, California Lottery Spokesperson Carolyn Becker told Patch. Over $1 billion in the entire 40-year history of the CA Lottery has gone unclaimed, Becker said.\nFind out what's happening in Los Angelesfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s a shame for potential winners to see any winning ticket expire, it does give a helpful boost to California public schools. All unclaimed prize money winds up helping support public education, so we can still feel good about it at the end of the day,\u201d Becker said.\nSince its inception in 1985, the California Lottery has generated more than $46 billion for California's public schools. The State Controller's Office determines how much lottery funds are dispersed to public education institutions based on the average daily attendance for school districts.\nFind out what's happening in Los Angelesfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nThe amount of unclaimed winnings varies wildly by year, Becker said. For example, in the fiscal year 2019-2020 $75.4 million went unclaimed while $19.5 million went unclaimed the next fiscal year 2020-2021.\nThe largest unclaimed jackpot in state history is also from the San Fernando Valley. In 2018, someone in Chatsworth became a record-setting loser when a $63 million SuperLotto Plus jackpot went unclaimed.\nA Los Angeles man Brandy Milliner, sued the state, alleging he bought the winning ticket. However, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos dismissed Milliner\u2019s lawsuit based on evidence provided by the state that Milliner\u2019s ticket wasn\u2019t the real deal.\nMilliner was so close to claiming the jackpot. According to his lawsuit, he even received a letter from the state congratulating him on his winning. But it was followed by another letter claiming his ticket was \u201ctoo damaged to be reconstructed.\u201d The letter cited a section of the California Lottery Act that explained the commission was unable to process Milliner\u2019s claim, the suit stated.\nHe tried to force the lottery commission to fork over the money claiming it had \u201cinterfered\u201d with his prize by withholding the ticket, refusing to return it and refusing to award him the grand prize.\nAccording to lottery officials, it\u2019s not uncommon for scammers to try to claim a jackpot with a hoax ticket. What is unusual in this case is that a major jackpot would go unclaimed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an odd situation,\u201d then California Lottery Deputy Director Russ Lopez told Patch when the deadline to claim the record-setting unclaimed ticket expired.\nHe said no credible winner ever came forward.\n\u201cWe pay out 60 million a week on average, so we have a lot of claims,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were so many hoaxes, so many photoshopped tickets, so many claims. Anybody can make a claim. The bottom line is: is it truthful? Did they purchase ticket? Is that the true original ticket with the true original numbers? We conduct a full and thorough investigation on all major jackpot wins.\u201d\nAccording to lottery, the mystery winner has two options. They can bring the ticket and the corresponding claim form to one of the California Lottery's nine offices across the state or they can fill out the necessary paperwork and mail it to the California Lottery headquarters in Sacramento on or before Dec. 7.\nMeanwhile, the current Mega Millions jackpot continues to grow as there were no top-prize winning tickets sold for Tuesday night's draw.

      "text": "Crime & Safety\n'It's The Lottery Curse,' Says Jackpot Winner Turned Bank Robber\nHe was a happy nightshift security guard before he won $19 million. Now he is a drug addict and serial bank robber headed to prison.\nPACIFIC PALISADES, CA \u2014 Call it the \"lottery curse defense.\"\nJames Allen Hayes, A former security guard who won a $19 million SuperLotto jackpot, lost it all and became a serial bank robber will be handed a prison sentence Thursday. His defense attorney, pleading for leniency, wrote that Hayes was a victim of the \"lottery curse\" and lost his \"bearing in life\" before turning to bank robbery.\nHayes is the man known to the FBI as the \"PT Cruiser Bandit\" and the \"Seasoned Bandit\" responsible for a string of bank robberies in Pacific Palisades, Stevenson Ranch, Valencia, Newhall and elsewhere. Investigators say he robbed banks to feed his $1,000-a-week heroin habit. He was homeless and living in a garage when the FBI finally closed in on him last year. Hayes' heists netted him about $40,000.\nFind out what's happening in Pacific Palisadesfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nAs part of his plea agreement, the 56-year-old Hayes agreed to forfeit a light-colored Chrysler PT Cruiser, which was used in some of the robberies and earned him the \"PT Cruiser Bandit\" moniker.\nProsecutors are asking U.S. District Judge Fernando M. Olguin to hand Hayes about five years behind bars, while the defense is pushing for a year in custody.\nFind out what's happening in Pacific Palisadesfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nHayes was supposed to spend his days tinkering with his classic car, vacationing with his wife on a tropical beach and helping out his friends and family. Hayes, then a graveyard shift security guard in Ventura, was sure his string of bad luck had come to an end in 1998 when he won the $19 million jackpot. The odds of winning the prize were more than 18 million to 1.\nUpon winning, he quit his night shift job with Dial Security in Ventura County. He would no longer have to live paycheck to paycheck. The IRS would get off his back and he\u2019d soup up his \u201868 Camaro. He would be able to spend more time with his wife, who worked days, and they would be able to take a trip to Hawaii.\n\"I'm not going to blow the money,\" Hayes told the Los Angeles Times back in 1998. \"I know I'll change. But only for the better. ... Mainly what I want to do is help out my family and friends in need.\" The money couldn\u2019t have come at a better time.\n\u201cI don't have a savings account,\" Hayes admitted to the Times. \"I have a restored muscle car.\"\nBut Hayes saw his winning as a sign of good things to come. He and his wife would buy a nice house together in Camarillo, and he\u2019d keep playing the lottery because now luck was on his side. And he\u2019d buy a new car, he told the local newspaper.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Hayes\u2019 life to fall apart. Not long after he won the lottery, he got divorced, and his ex-wife got half of the money, according to reports. Hayes walked away with a $6 million lump sum. It wasn\u2019t enough to support a serious drug habit. Spending, $1,000 a week on heroin, Hayes blew through his winnings, according to investigators.\nSo the former security guard became a bank robber.\nIn each heist, Hayes used a note to rob the bank.\nOn May 24 of 2017, Hayes walked into a Union Bank on Carpinteria Avenue and slipped the teller with a note that read, \u201c$5,000, no signals, no dye packs, no GPS, no sensors, no eye contact.\u201d\nBut after getting away with 10 robberies between April and September, Hayes' luck finally ran out.\nCity News Service contributed to this report.

For Brown, this is \"regular entertainment.\"\nFind out what's happening in Murrietafor free with the latest updates from Patch.\n\u201cIf she hadn\u2019t asked me to go out, I might not have gone to the store,\u201d Brown said. \u201cOr I would\u2019ve gone later, and somebody else would\u2019ve gotten the ticket. But everything lined up in the universe.\u201d\nBrown returned home with his ticket, and his wife took over childcare duties again. Once upstairs, he set to scratching his tickets. Purchased for $20 each, the tickets have a maximum prize value of $5 million, according to the CA Lottery.\nFirst, he won $75.\nMoving on to the next game card, he saw a 5 with a lot of zeroes.\nWas it $5,000?

It ruined him, too.\nOn Thursday, Hayes, a security guard turned overnight millionaire, stood in a Los Angeles courtroom and pleaded guilty to committing a series of bank robberies. Hayes, 55, admitted to being the serial bank robber known to federal agents as both the Seasoned Bandit and PT Cruiser Bandit. His admission comes 20 years after he won a $19 million Superlotto jackpot. The jackpot made him he second-largest Ventura County lottery winner ever.\nBy the time he was arrested last year, he was homeless.\nFind out what's happening in Pacific Palisadesfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nHayes was supposed to spend his days tinkering with his classic car, vacationing with his wife on a tropical beach and helping out his friends and family. Instead, he could spend the rest of his life in a federal prison, trying to kick a $1,000-a-week heroin habit.\n'I Know I'll Change ...For The better'\nHayes was sure his string of bad luck had come to an end in 1998 when he won the $19 million jackpot. The odds of winning the prize were more than 18 million to 1, and good fortune seemed to be on his side.\nFind out what's happening in Pacific Palisadesfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nThings were going to change for Hayes. He quit his night shift job with Dial Security in Ventura County. He would no longer have to live paycheck to paycheck. The IRS would get off his back and he\u2019d soup up his \u201868 Camaro. He would be able to spend more time with his wife, who worked days, and they would be able to take a trip to Hawaii.\n\"I'm not going to blow the money,\" Hayes told the Los Angeles Times back in 1998. \"I know I'll change. But only for the better. ... Mainly what I want to do is help out my family and friends in need.\"\nThe money couldn\u2019t have come at a better time.\n\u201cI don't have a savings account,\" Hayes admitted to the Times. \"I have a restored muscle car.\"\nBut Hayes saw his winning as a sign of good things to come. He and his wife would buy a nice house together in Camarillo, and he\u2019d keep playing the lottery because now luck was on his side. And he\u2019d buy a new car, he told the local newspaper.\nThe PT Cruiser Bandit\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Hayes\u2019 life to fall apart. Not long after he won the lottery, he got divorced, and his ex-wife got half of the money, according to reports. Hayes walked away with a $6 million lump sum. It wasn\u2019t enough to support a serious drug habit. Spending, $1,000 a week on heroin, Hayes blew through his winnings, according to investigators.\nSo the former security guard became a bank robber.\nHe was indicted last year in Los Angeles federal court in connection with a string of 10 heists between April and September in Pacific Palisades, Stevenson Ranch and Newhall. On Thursday, he pleaded guilty to bank robberies in Newhall, Valencia and Santa Barbara County, in which he got away with a total of about $40,000.\nIn each heist, Hayes used a note to rob the bank.\nOn May 24 of 2017, Hayes walked into a Union Bank on Carpinteria Avenue and slipped the teller with a note that read, \u201c$5,000, no signals, no dye packs, no GPS, no sensors, no eye contact.\u201d\nWith the money from that haul, he bought himself a PT Cruiser, federal prosecutors allege. Formerly dubbed the \u201cSeasoned Bandit\u201d for his shock of white hair, he became known as the \"PT Cruiser bandit\" to FBI investigators closing in on him.\nHayes used the same method during each robbery.\nOn June 12, he gave a teller a note, threatening to shoot her. \u201cGive me $10,000 in large bills. Be quick, I\u2019m watching your every move. I have a gun,\u201d it said.\nHayes continued his spree, robbing two to three banks every month until investigators found him squatting in a garage in Ventura last October.\nHayes faces 80 years in prison when he\u2019s sentenced in June.\nBack when he won the lottery, Hayes reflected on his life.\n\"I was very happy before this,\" Hayes told the Times. \"This just tops it off.\"\nPhotos courtesy of the FBI\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.

Someone in Chatsworth is a record-setting loser. With a court ruling this week, a Los Angeles man lost his bid to claim a $63 million SuperLotto Plus jackpot, by far, the largest jackpot in state history to go unclaimed.\nThe man, Brandy Milliner, sued the state, alleging he bought the winning ticket. However, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos dismissed Milliner\u2019s lawsuit based on evidence provided by the state that Milliner\u2019s ticket wasn\u2019t the real deal.\nAccording to the California Attorney General's Office, the winning ticket was purchased Aug. 8, 2015 at the 7-Eleven store at 20871 Lassen St. in Chatsworth, but Milliner\u2019s ticket was bought at a 7-Eleven store at 4051 Leimert Blvd. in Los Angeles on July 10, 2015.

I would let the lottery investigators do their job,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat would I have to lose at that point?\u201d\nThe deadline to file a claim for the winnings was Thursday afternoon. Several people filed claims for the winnings.\nEach claim is being investigated, Johnston said. The true winner must show proof that she is the owner of the ticket. Such proof may include a photo of the front and back of the winning ticket with the owner\u2019s signature on it.\n\u201cWe have to look at a lot of different factors,\u201d Johnston said. \u201c There is a lot of security, a process they go through.\u201d\nThe lottery office keeps the verification process famously secret. It\u2019s not unusual for frauds to come forward with elaborate stories to claim the money. Investigators have to stay one step ahead of fraudsters.\nA man claiming to have won the largest unclaimed jackpot \u2014 a $63 million ticket sold in Chatsworth in 2015 \u2014 sued the state for rejecting his claim. The yearslong lawsuit ended when a judge sided with the state, concluding the man\u2019s claim was not legitimate.\nLargest Unclaimed Jackpots In State History\n- $63 million (draw date Aug. 8, 2015).\n- $28.5 million (draw date Sept. 10, 1993).\n- $26 million (the current unclaimed SuperLotto Plus jackpot from the Nov. 14, 2020, draw).\n- $25 million (draw date Jan. 8, 2000).\n- $20 million (draw date Oct. 11, 1997).\nThe lottery has a team of experts and a forensics center to help identify the true winner and root out fraud.\n\u201cIt does happen. People get desperate,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cI wish we could show off our security forensic center. It\u2019s amazing what they can do. There are so many little tricks that are built into tickets that [the public] doesn\u2019t even know about. We want the real winners to be awarded the cash, but sadly we do get some people who try to work the system.\u201d\nJohnston said it\u2019s too soon to determine if the woman in Norwalk did have the winning ticket. The verification process will take weeks.\nIn the meantime, there is a moral to this story, lottery officials said: Sign the back of your ticket and snap a picture of the front and the back.\nSEE ALSO:\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
