      "summary": "A cold front moving from Canada is expected to lower temperatures across the Midwest and East, with highs dropping into the 60s and 50s for several days. The front will bring unusually dry conditions, with August rainfall in the Northeast falling to 6–10% of normal. While the Midwest may see a brief return to warmth later in the week, the overall pattern points to a cooler, drier September in much of the eastern United States.",
