  "description": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Taseko Mines Limited (TSX:TKO, NYSE:TGB, LSE: TKO)) (\"Taseko\" or the \"Company\") reports second quarter 2025 Adjusted EBITDA* of $17",
  "content": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Taseko Mines Limited TKOTGBTKO) (\"Taseko\" or the \"Company\") reports second quarter 2025 Adjusted EBITDA* of $17 million, net income of $22 million ($0.07 per share) and an Adjusted net loss* of $13 million ($0.04 loss per share). Revenues for the second quarter were $116 million from the sale of 19 million pounds of copper and 178 thousand pounds of molybdenum.\n\nSecond quarter copper production at Gibraltar was in line with plan and mining operations made significant headway opening up the Connector pit. Tons mined was 31% higher than the first quarter, and the improved mining rates have set the mine up to deliver the expected higher grades in the second half of the year. The mine produced 20 million pounds of copper and 180 thousand pounds of molybdenum in the second quarter at Total operating costs (C1)* of US$3.14 per pound of copper produced. Mill throughput averaged 84,200 tons per day at average copper grades of 0.20% and copper recoveries were 63%. Recoveries continued to be impacted by both low grades and also high oxide and secondary mineralization. Second quarter copper production also includes the first copper cathodes from Gibraltar's newly refurbished SX/EW plant which restarted in late May after being idle since 2015. After a quick ramp up in June and July, the plant is now operating at a steady state.\n\nConstruction activities at Florence Copper continue to advance on schedule and the project remains on track to achieve first copper cathode production before the end of 2025. At the end of June, overall project completion was over 90% and US$239 million had been incurred on construction in the last 18 months. Construction spending was lower than the prior quarter and, with approximately 90% of total expected construction costs now incurred, spending will decline again in the third quarter as construction activities wind down.\n\nStuart McDonald, President & CEO of Taseko, commented, \"I am very pleased with progress at Florence Copper, where our project team has done an excellent job maintaining the project schedule and budget, without compromising the safety of our contractors or employees at site. Construction activities will soon be shifting to commissioning of the SX/EW plant systems and beginning wellfield operations. With less than six months until anticipated first production, this is an exciting time for our Company. We still have a lot of work ahead to complete construction and ramp up copper production, but the more than ten years of effort to get us here is about to payoff.\n\nAt Gibraltar, mining operations have made good progress advancing deeper into the Connector Pit and we're looking forward to a much stronger second half. The expected higher grades and improved recoveries will lead to increased copper production and stronger cash flows.\n\nDespite the recent volatility in Comex copper prices, we remain in a healthy copper price environment and it's great timing to be growing our copper production base with a new US-based operation. With lowest quartile operating costs, Florence Copper will begin to generate strong cashflows next year as it ramps up to design capacity.\"\n\nMr. McDonald continued, \"Another important goal for us is to unlock value from our longer-term growth portfolio, and in recent months we've achieved some significant milestones with those projects. We published an updated technical study for Yellowhead, which showed a significant improvement in project economics. At a copper price of US$4.25 per pound, Yellowhead has an after-tax NPV (8%) of $2 billion and a 21% internal rate of return. With average annual copper production of 178 million pounds over 25 years, Yellowhead represents a high quality, longer-term growth option for Taseko. Also, in early July the Environmental Assessment process was formally initiated with the filing and acceptance of the Initial Project Description. We will look to unlock further value from Yellowhead as it advances through the permitting process, and as we progress other technical and financing aspects of the project.\"\n\n\"Another significant development was the recent agreement reached with T\u015dilhqot'in Nation and Province of BC on our New Prosperity Project. The payment of $75 million was received from the Province of BC during the second quarter and Taseko retains a 77.5% interest in the project. We believe this agreement could potentially open a pathway for the mine to be developed in the future, but only with the T\u015dilhqot'in Nation's consent.\n\nWith Florence Copper just months away from first production and with Yellowhead now moving forward into permitting, we are making significant strides advancing our long-term strategy to become a North American multi-asset copper miner,\" concluded Mr. McDonald.\n\u2022 Earnings from mining operations before depletion, amortization and non-recurring items* was $20.7 million, Adjusted EBITDA* was $17.4 million and cash flows from operations was $26.0 million;\n\u2022 Net income was $21.9 million ($0.07 per share) and Adjusted net loss* was $13.0 million ($0.04 loss per share) after removal of unrealized foreign exchange gains on the Company's US dollar-denominated debt;\n\u2022 Gibraltar produced 19.8 million pounds of copper at a total operating (C1) cost* of US$3.14 per pound of copper produced. Copper head grade was 0.20% and recovery was 63% for the quarter reflecting the continued processing of lower grade stockpiled material which also had higher oxidation;\n\u2022 Gibraltar sold 19.0 million pounds of copper at an average realized copper price of US$4.32 per pound and at an average Canadian dollar exchange rate of 1.38, contributing to revenues of $116.1 million for Taseko;\n\u2022 At June 30, 2025, construction of the Florence Copper commercial production facility was over 90% complete and remains on schedule for first copper production before the end of the year. All 90 injection and recovery wells planned for the construction phase have now been drilled and completed. Construction of the solvent extraction and electrowinning areas continue to advance, with the installation of major components well underway;\n\u2022 In June 2025, Taseko, T\u015dilhqot'in Nation and the Province of BC reached an agreement concerning the New Prosperity project. Taseko received a payment of $75 million from the Province of BC on closing of the transaction in the second quarter;\n\u2022 In July 2025, the Company filed an updated technical report on the Yellowhead project highlighting an after-tax net present value of $2.0 billion for the project (8% after-tax discount rate), after-tax internal rate of return of 21%, and payback period of 3.3 years. The Company also announced that it had submitted an Initial Project Description for the Yellowhead project and formally commenced the Environmental Assessment process with regulators;\n\u2022 The Company has copper collar contracts in place to secure a minimum copper price of US$4.00 per pound for 54 million pounds of copper for the remainder of 2025; and,\n\u2022 At June 30, 2025, the Company had a cash balance of $122.0 million and available liquidity of $197.0 million including the undrawn portion of its corporate revolving credit facility.\n\nMining operations continued to advance through the upper sections of the Connector pit, opening up the deeper, higher quality ore zones for the next phase of mining. A total of 30.4 million tons were mined in the second quarter, a 30% increase over the prior quarter due to increased productivity of the mining fleet. Approximately 65% of the ore mined in the quarter was oxide ore, which was added to the heap leach pads and contributed to a lower strip ratio.\n\nLower-grade stockpiled ore continued to be the primary source of mill feed in the quarter, resulting in copper production levels similar to the first quarter. Gibraltar produced 19.4 million pounds of copper in concentrate in the second quarter. Copper head grade was 0.20% and recovery was 63%, impacted by oxidation and supergene material in the stockpiled ore which mainly originated from the upper benches of the Connector pit. Mill throughput was 7.7 million tons in the quarter and remained consistently at nameplate capacity throughout the quarter.\n\nIn the second quarter, Gibraltar completed the refurbishment and successfully restarted its solvent extraction and electrowinning (\"SX/EW\") plant which had been idle since 2015 and produced 395 thousand pounds of copper cathode.\n\nCapitalized stripping costs totaling $30.8 million remained higher in the second quarter attributable to a higher than normal strip ratio for sulphide ore tons in the Connector pit. Total site costs* including capitalized stripping was $116.8 million in the quarter, higher than the prior quarter primarily due to higher mining rates. Total site costs were also higher than the prior year quarter due to mill downtime in 2024 related to a labour strike and crusher relocation project.\n\nMolybdenum production was 180 thousand pounds in the second quarter, comparable to 185 thousand pounds in the comparative prior year quarter. At an average molybdenum price of US$20.71 per pound for the quarter, molybdenum contributed a by-product credit of US$0.19 per pound of copper produced.\n\nOff-property costs of US$0.18 per pound of copper produced were consistent with the prior quarter and reflect Gibraltar's 2025 offtake agreements with average treatment and refining charges (\"TCRC\") of $nil for the year.\n\nTotal operating (C1) costs* were US$3.14 per pound of copper produced in the second quarter compared to US$2.99 per pound of copper produced in the comparative prior year quarter. The increase in total operating (C1) costs was attributable to low site operating costs in the prior year from mill downtime, as well as lower copper production and lower molybdenum by-product credits in the current quarter, partially offset by higher capitalized stripping costs and lower off-property costs as outlined in the bridge graph below:\n\nMining activity will continue to advance in the Connector pit, which will be the primary source of mill feed for the remainder of 2025 and the years ahead. Significant increases in head grades and recoveries, and higher mill throughput from processing the softer Connector pit ore, are expected in the second half of 2025 and continuing into 2026. Copper production for the year is expected to be 110 to 120 million pounds, including cathode production.\n\nMolybdenum production is also forecast to increase in the second half of 2025 as molybdenum grades are expected to be notably higher in Connector pit ore.\n\nThe Company has offtake agreements covering Gibraltar concentrate production in 2025 and 2026, which contain significantly lower and in certain cases negative (premium) TCRC rates reflecting the tight copper smelting market. Offtake agreements are in place for substantially all of Gibraltar's copper concentrate production in 2025 and 2026, and, based on the contract terms, the Company expects average TCRCs to be to around $nil in 2025 and 2026.\n\nThe Company has a prudent hedging program in place to protect a minimum copper price and Gibraltar cash flow during the Florence Copper construction period. Currently, the Company has copper collar contracts in place that secure a minimum copper price of US$4.00 per pound for 54 million pounds of copper production for the remainder of 2025 (refer to \"Financial Condition Review\u2014Hedging Strategy\" for details).\n\nThe Company has all the key permits in place for the commercial production facility at Florence and construction continues to advance on schedule. Over 900,000 project hours have been worked with no reportable injuries or environmental incidents. The Company has a fixed-price contract with the general contractor for construction of the SX/EW plant and associated surface infrastructure and activities are beginning to wind down from peak spend in the first quarter.\n\nAll injection and recovery wells planned to be drilled during the construction phase were completed as of June 30, 2025. Remaining construction activities are advancing on plan and project areas will soon start transitioning to commissioning.\n\nOperational readiness remains a key focus for site management. Site activities are focused on hiring additional personnel and developing detailed operating plans for the ramp up of production, which is expected to begin before the end of this year.\n\nFlorence Copper commercial facility construction costs were US$33.0 million in the second quarter and US$239.3 million has been incurred on the Florence Copper commercial facility construction as of June 30, 2025.\n\nThe Company has a technical report titled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report Florence Copper Project, Pinal County, Arizona\" dated March 30, 2023 (the \"Florence 2023 Technical Report\") on SEDAR+. The Florence 2023 Technical Report was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43\u2011101 (\"NI 43-101\") and incorporated the results of test work from the production test facility (\"PTF\") as well as updated capital and operating costs (Q3 2022 basis) for the commercial production facility.\n\nProject highlights based on the Florence 2023 Technical Report are detailed below:\n\u2022 Net present value of US$930 million (at US$3.75 copper price, 8% after-tax discount rate);\n\u2022 Operating costs (C1) of US$1.11 per pound of copper produced;\n\u2022 Total life of mine production of 1.5 billion pounds of copper; and\n\nBased on the Florence 2023 Technical Report, the estimated construction costs for the Florence Copper commercial production facility were US$232 million and management continues to expect that total construction costs will be within 10% to 15% of this estimate.\n\nTaseko's strategy has been to grow the company by acquiring and developing a pipeline of projects focused on copper in North America. We continue to believe this will generate long-term returns for shareholders. Our other development projects are located in BC, Canada.\n\nThe Yellowhead copper project (\"Yellowhead\") is expected to produce 4.4 billion pounds of copper over a 25-year mine life at an average C1 cost, net of by-product credit, of US$1.90 per pound of copper produced. During the first 5 years of operation, Yellowhead is expected to produce an average of 206 million pounds of copper per year at an average C1 cost, net of by-product credit, of US$1.62 per pound of copper produced. Yellowhead also contains valuable precious metal by-products with 282,000 ounces of gold production and 19.4 million ounces of silver production over the life of mine.\n\nThe economic analysis in the Yellowhead 2025 Technical Report (defined below) was prepared using a long-term copper price of US$4.25 per pound, a long-term gold price of US$2,400 per ounce, and a long-term silver price of US$28.00 per ounce. This report titled \"Technical Report Update on the Yellowhead Copper Project, British Columbia, Canada\" (the \"Yellowhead 2025 Technical Report\") was published on July 10, 2025 under the supervision of Richard Weymark, P. Eng., MBA, Vice President, Engineering for Taseko and a Qualified Person as defined by NI 43\u2011101.\n\nProject highlights based on the Yellowhead 2025 Technical Report are detailed below:\n\u2022 Average annual copper production of 178 million pounds over a 25 year mine life at total cash costs (C1) of US$1.90 per pound of copper produced;\n\u2022 Over the first 5 years of the mine life, copper grade is expected to average 0.32% producing an average of 206 million pounds of copper at total cash costs (C1) of US$1.62 per pound of copper produced;\n\u2022 Concentrator designed to process 90,000 tonnes per day of ore with an expected copper recovery of 90%, and produce a clean copper concentrate with payable gold and silver by-products;\n\u2022 After-tax net present value of $2.0 billion (8% after-tax discount rate) and after-tax internal rate of return of 21%;\n\u2022 Initial capital costs of $2.0 billion with a payback period of 3.3 years; and\n\u2022 Expected to be eligible for the Canadian federal Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit, with 30% (approximately $540 million) of eligible initial capital costs reimbursed in year 1 of operation.\n\nIn the second quarter, the project's Initial Project Description was filed and accepted by the British Columbia Environmental Assessment Office and Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, formally commencing the Environmental Assessment process. The Company has been engaging with project stakeholders to ensure that the development of Yellowhead is in line with environmental and social expectations. The Company opened a community Yellowhead project office in 2024 to support ongoing engagement with local communities including First Nations.\n\nIn June 2025, Taseko, the T\u015dilhqot'in Nation and the Province of BC reached a historic agreement concerning the New Prosperity project (the \"Te\u1e91tan Biny Agreement\"). The Te\u1e91tan Biny Agreement ends litigation among the parties while providing certainty with respect to how the significant copper-gold resource at New Prosperity may be developed in the future, and meaningfully advances the goals of reconciliation in BC.\n\u2022 Taseko received a payment of $75 million from the Province of BC upon closing of the agreement;\n\u2022 Taseko contributed a 22.5% equity interest in the New Prosperity mineral tenures to a trust for the future benefit of the T\u015dilhqot'in Nation. The trust will transfer the property interest to the T\u015dilhqot'in Nation if and when it consents to a proposal to pursue mineral development in the project area;\n\u2022 Taseko retains a majority interest (77.5%) in the New Prosperity mineral tenures and can divest some or all of its interest at any time, including to other mining companies that could advance a project with the consent of the T\u015dilhqot'in Nation. However, Taseko has committed not to be the proponent (operator) of mineral exploration and development activities at New Prosperity, nor the owner of a future mine development;\n\u2022 Taseko has entered into a consent agreement with the T\u015dilhqot'in Nation, whereby no mineral exploration or development activity can proceed in the New Prosperity project area without the free, prior and informed consent of the T\u015dilhqot'in Nation;\n\u2022 The Province of BC and the T\u015dilhqot'in Nation have agreed to negotiate the process by which the consent of the T\u015dilhqot'in Nation will be sought for any proposed mining project to proceed through an environmental assessment process; and\n\u2022 The T\u015dilhqot'in Nation and the Province of BC have agreed to undertake a land-use planning process for the area of the mineral tenures and a broader area of land within T\u015dilhqot'in territory. The Province of BC will provide funding to the T\u015dilhqot'in Nation to facilitate the land-use planning process and for a Cultural Revitalization Fund.\n\nThe converter pilot test is ongoing to provide additional process data to support the design of commercial process facilities, and final product samples to support product marketing initiatives. The Company is also conducting a scoping study to investigate the potential for Aley niobium oxide production to supply the growing market for niobium-based batteries.\n\nThe Company's Annual General Meeting was held on June 12, 2025 and shareholders voted in favor of all items of business before the meeting, including the continuation of the Company's amended and restated shareholders rights plan for a 3-year period and the advisory resolution on executive compensation (Say-on-Pay), and the election of all director nominees. Detailed voting results for the 2025 Annual General Meeting are available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.\n\nIn June 2025, the Company published its annual Sustainability Report titled C2 (Copper x Community) (the \"Report\"). The Report highlights Taseko's operational and sustainability achievements, with an emphasis on the connection between copper production and the people, communities, and social environments that support and benefit from our operations and projects.\n\nWith 20 years of successful operations under Taseko's stewardship, 2024 marked a milestone year for the Company's flagship operation, the Gibraltar mine. As Canada's second-largest copper mine, Gibraltar continues to reflect Taseko's commitment to operational excellence, health and safety, and delivering \u2018360\u00b0 of Value' for all stakeholders.\n\nFlorence Copper will soon become one of the lowest carbon and energy-intensive copper producers in the world, offering domestically produced, traceable and high-purity copper metal to support North American manufacturing and economic security.\n\nWhile profitable operations and return on investment are critical drivers for Taseko's success, the Company also delivers value to its employees and operating communities, business partners, Indigenous Nations and governments. The Report is an opportunity to showcase the important benefits that the Company generates through its operations, investments and people.\n\nThe full report can be viewed and downloaded at www.tasekomines.com/sustainability/overview.\n\nFor further information on Taseko, see the Company's website at tasekomines.com or contact:\n\nNo regulatory authority has approved or disapproved of the information contained in this news release\n\nThis MD&A includes certain non-GAAP performance measures that do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. These measures may differ from those used by, and may not be comparable to such measures as reported by, other issuers. The Company believes that these measures are commonly used by certain investors, in conjunction with conventional IFRS measures, to enhance their understanding of the Company's performance. These measures have been derived from the Company's financial statements and applied on a consistent basis. The following tables below provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures.\n\nTotal operating cost includes all costs absorbed into inventory, as well as transportation costs and insurance recoverable. Site operating cost is calculated by removing net changes in inventory, depletion and amortization, insurance recoverable, and transportation costs from cost of sales. Site operating cost, net of by-product credit is calculated by subtracting by-product credits from site operating cost. Site operating cost, net of by-product credit per pound is calculated by dividing the aggregate of the applicable costs by pounds of copper produced. Total operating cost per pound is the sum of site operating costs, net of by-product credits and off-property costs divided by pounds of copper produced. By-product credit is calculated based on actual sales of molybdenum (net of treating costs) and silver during the period divided by the total pounds of copper produced during the period. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented.\n\nTotal site costs include site operating costs charged to cost of sales and mining costs capitalized to property, plant and equipment in the period. This measure is intended to capture total site operating costs incurred during the period calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented.\n\nAdjusted net income (loss) removes the effect of the following transactions from net income (loss) as reported under IFRS:\n\u2022 Loss on settlement of debt, net of capitalized interest;\n\u2022 Gain on acquisition of control of Gibraltar;\n\u2022 Inventory write-ups to fair value that was sold or processed;\n\u2022 Tax effect of sale of non-recurring interest; and\n\nManagement believes these transactions do not reflect the underlying operating performance of the Company's core mining business and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Furthermore, unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, changes in the fair value of financial instruments, and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses are not necessarily reflective of the underlying operating results for the periods presented.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share (\"Adjusted EPS\") is Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders of the Company divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.\n\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company's performance and ability to service debt. Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the industry, many of which present adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results. Issuers of \"high yield\" securities also present adjusted EBITDA because investors, analysts and rating agencies considering it useful in measuring the ability of those issuers to meet debt service obligations.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also eliminates the impact of a number of transactions that are not considered indicative of ongoing operating performance. Certain items of expense are added back and certain items of income are deducted from net income that are not likely to recur or are not indicative of the Company's underlying operating results for the reporting periods presented or for future operating performance and consist of:\n\u2022 Gain on acquisition of control of Gibraltar;\n\u2022 Inventory write-ups to net realizable value that was sold or processed; and\n\nEarnings from mining operations before depletion, amortization and non-recurring items\n\nEarnings from mining operations before depletion, amortization and non-recurring items is earnings from mining operations with depletion and amortization, and any items that are not considered indicative of ongoing operating performance added back. The Company discloses this measure, which has been derived from the Company's financial statements and applied on a consistent basis, to assist in understanding the results of the Company's operations and financial position, and it is meant to provide further information about the financial results to investors.\n\nThe Company discloses this measure, which has been derived from the Company's financial statements and applied on a consistent basis, to provide assistance in understanding the Company's site operations on a tons milled basis.\n\nThe technical information contained in this MD&A related to Florence Copper is based on the report titled \"NI 43\u2011101 Technical Report \u2013 Florence Copper Project, Pinal County, Arizona\" issued on March 30, 2023 with an effective date of March 15, 2023, which is available on SEDAR+.
