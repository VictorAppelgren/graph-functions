  "description": "ASX:CLX 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore CTI Logistics's Fair Values from the Community and select yours For...",
  "content": "Explore CTI Logistics's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\n\n\nFor beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\n\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like CTI Logistics (ASX:CLX). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Impressively, CTI Logistics has grown EPS by 17% per year, compound, in the last three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While we note CTI Logistics achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 6.3% to AU$325m. That's a real positive.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\n\nSee our latest analysis for CTI Logistics\n\nCTI Logistics isn't a huge company, given its market capitalisation of AU$147m. That makes it extra important to check on its balance sheet strength.\n\nAre CTI Logistics Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nMany consider high insider ownership to be a strong sign of alignment between the leaders of a company and the ordinary shareholders. So as you can imagine, the fact that CTI Logistics insiders own a significant number of shares certainly is appealing. Owning 48% of the company, insiders have plenty riding on the performance of the the share price. Shareholders and speculators should be reassured by this kind of alignment, as it suggests the business will be run for the benefit of shareholders. To give you an idea, the value of insiders' holdings in the business are valued at AU$71m at the current share price. That should be more than enough to keep them focussed on creating shareholder value!",

      "text": "Results\n22\nMidstream oil and gas companies, specifically pipeline operators, are well-positioned to benefit from Trump\u2019s executive orders on fossil fuels enacted in early 2025. \u2013 \u2013 These policies aim to accelerate infrastructure development by streamlining environmental reviews and permitting processes, such as those under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling. Pipelines and storage facilities will be critical to moving larger volumes of oil and gas efficiently, especially with the renewed emphasis on LNG exports to meet global demand.\n22 companies\nChevron\nMarket Cap: US$313.6b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in the integrated energy and chemicals operations in the United States and internationally.\nCVX\nUS$155.01\n7D\n2.4%\n1Y\n6.9%\nWilliams Companies\nMarket Cap: US$70.7b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States.\nWMB\nUS$57.89\n7D\n-3.9%\n1Y\n33.8%\nKinder Morgan\nMarket Cap: US$59.5b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in North America.\nKMI\nUS$26.89\n7D\n-4.3%\n1Y\n27.9%\nCheniere Energy\nMarket Cap: US$51.7b\nAn energy infrastructure company, primarily engages in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) related businesses in the United States.\nLNG\nUS$230.83\n7D\n-3.1%\n1Y\n26.0%\nMarathon Petroleum\nMarket Cap: US$49.1b\nOperates as an integrated downstream energy company in the United States.\nMPC\nUS$160.84\n7D\n-2.8%\n1Y\n-8.5%\nONEOK\nMarket Cap: US$47.5b\nOperates as a midstream service provider of gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage, and marine export services in the United States.\nOKE\nUS$74.46\n7D\n-5.7%\n1Y\n-12.4%\nDT Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$10.6b\nProvides integrated natural gas services in the United States.\nDTM\nUS$104.58\n7D\n-1.0%\n1Y\n42.5%\nAntero Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.8b\nOwns, operates, and develops midstream energy assets in the Appalachian Basin.\nAM\nUS$18.44\n7D\n-0.5%\n1Y\n33.1%\nHess Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.6b\nOwns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream assets and provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers in the United States.\nHESM\nUS$41.64\n7D\n-2.1%\n1Y\n17.2%\nKinetik Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$6.5b\nThrough its subsidiaries, operates as a midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin.\nKNTK\nUS$41.30\n7D\n-3.5%\n1Y\n1.6%\nPBF Energy\nMarket Cap: US$2.6b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in refining and supplying petroleum products.\nPBF\nUS$22.02\n7D\n1.6%\n1Y\n-40.7%\nRattler Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$2.2b\nRattler Midstream LP owns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream and energy-related infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.\nRTLR\nUS$15.22\n7D\n3.5%\n1Y\n45.0%\nPar Pacific Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.4b\nOperates as an energy company in the United States.\nPARR\nUS$27.30\n7D\n-8.9%\n1Y\n11.9%\nDelek US Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.2b\nEngages in the integrated downstream energy business in the United States.\nDK\nUS$20.65\n7D\n-0.6%\n1Y\n-0.1%\nClean Energy Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$450.8m\nOffers natural gas as alternative fuels for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions in the United States and Canada.\nCLNE\nUS$2.29\n7D\n16.2%\n1Y\n-21.0%\nOPAL Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$391.8m\nEngages in the production and distribution of renewable natural gas (RNG) for use as a vehicle fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets throughout the United States.\nOPAL\nUS$2.21\n7D\n-2.2%\n1Y\n-37.9%\nSummit Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$304.1m\nFocuses on owning, developing, and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets primarily shale formations in the continental United States.\nSMC\nUS$24.44\n7D\n0.5%\n1Y\n-32.9%\nGranite Falls Energy\nMarket Cap: US$91.1m\nEngages in the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products in the continental United States.\nGFGY\nUS$2,975.00\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a\nStabilis Solutions\nMarket Cap: US$82.8m\nAn energy transition company, provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation, and fueling solutions primarily using liquefied natural gas (LNG) to various end markets in North America.\nSLNG\nUS$4.53\n7D\n1.5%\n1Y\n9.0%\nVivakor\nMarket Cap: US$45.0m\nOperates, acquires, and develops technologies and assets in the oil and gas industry in the United States and Kuwait.\nVIVK\nUS$0.97\n7D\n-13.0%\n1Y\n-49.4%\nMirage Energy\nMarket Cap: US$684.0k\nThrough its subsidiaries, focuses on developing an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States.\nMRGE\nUS$0.0011\n7D\n-8.3%\n1Y\n-84.7%\nEnergtek\nMarket Cap: US$51.4k\nProvides natural gas delivery solutions based on mobile pipe-less technologies and products.\nEGTK\nUS$0.0001\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a"
