  "content": "Financial expert Dave Ramsey urged a listener to set aside guilt and avoid using inheritance money as a bargaining chip for family reconciliation.\n\nCaller Says Estranged Sister Was Left Out Of Will, Learns At Funeral\n\nIn August, on The Ramsey Show, a caller named Cody described inheriting roughly $150,000 in cash and investments after his mother's death.\n\nHis older sister, estranged from the family for about a decade, was intentionally left out of the will, a fact she discovered at the funeral. Cody admitted he felt guilty and considered giving her part of his share to mend the relationship.\n\n\"That's painful. I'm sorry,\" Ramsey told him, adding that the situation should have been addressed while the mother was alive. \"You didn't do this. Your mom did this. If your sister wants to be angry with someone, it would be with your mom.\"\n\nTrending: Would You Have Invested in eBay or Uber Early? The Same Backers Are Betting on This Vacation Home Platform\n\nRamsey Says Inheritance Is \u2018Not An Entitlement\u2018\n\nCo-host Rachel Cruze echoed the sentiment: \"It feels like she has to be paid to get back into the family. That feels weird to me.\"\n\nRamsey warned that \"money won't do that. It will not mend a relationship,\" comparing it to \"buying\" affection, which he called a counterfeit connection.\n\nHe also stressed that inheritance is \"not an entitlement\" and that changing the will's intent would be \"somewhat unethical.\"\n\nEarlier, a 26-year-old law student named Nathaniel called The Ramsey Show seeking advice on whether to help his fianc\u00e9e's parents, who are $25,000 in debt after a failed investment.\n\nNathaniel, who inherited $1 million and keeps it in a low-risk trust, has not told his fianc\u00e9e or her parents about the inheritance. With marriage approaching, he struggled over whether withholding financial help would be wrong, given that the debt came from the parents\u2019 mortgaging their fully paid-off apartment for a risky venture.\n\nRamsey and co-host Jade Warshaw told Nathaniel that honesty with his fianc\u00e9e comes before any financial issue, urging him to have an open conversation right away.\n\nSee Also; 2,000 High Earners Manage $6B With This AI Platform \u2014 Book Your Private Demo\n\nCaller Inherits $14 Million, Discovers Family Friend Was Likely His Father\n\nOnce, a 31-year-old caller stunned The Ramsey Show hosts John Delony and George Kamel by revealing he had unexpectedly inherited between $10 million and $14 million from a man he believed was just a family friend, only to learn through the will that the man was likely his biological father.",

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nAmerica has a debt problem, and recent policy is making it worse. President Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d is expected to add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, and economists project that the debt-to-GDP ratio will go from 100% to 120% in the same timespan.\nAs a result, corporations and consumers will be stuck with high interest rates until something changes.\nThat change might just come from artificial intelligence, one company argues.\nRange is an AI-powered wealth management platform for high earners that centralizes investments, taxes, estate plans, and more in one account. The platform uses advanced AI technology to deliver personalized financial guidance at fees 75-90% lower than traditional advisors, making expert wealth management more accessible. Today, Range serves nearly 2,000 clients managing over $6 billion in assets.\nTaresh Batra, Range\u2019s vice president of Investments, says these AI-driven productivity gains could be the key to accelerating GDP growth while bringing inflation and interest rates down. \u201cHigher growth and lower interest rates as a result of AI could be a panacea for the markets,\u201d Batra says.\nProductivity is Key\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office uses the following formula to measure and forecast the country\u2019s GDP, or Gross Domestic Product:\nReal GDP Growth = Labor Growth(x labor contribution) + Capital Growth(x capital contribution) + Productivity\n\u201cOf these variables, changes in productivity have the largest impact on GDP growth,\u201d Batra says. \u201cTechnological innovation has been the driver of productivity over the course of history.\u201d\nAI, Batra argues, has the potential to improve productivity and benefit the economy in the coming years, similarly to how the dot-com boom did in the mid-1990s.\nHere\u2019s how:\n- Direct Economic Growth: With AI, companies and workers can be more productive without requiring additional resources.\n- More Jobs, Not Less: While AI may automate certain tasks, history shows that technology creates more jobs than it replaces. In fact, 60% of today\u2019s jobs didn\u2019t exist in 1940. The World Economic Forum projects AI will generate a net gain of 78 million new jobs this decade alone. Range itself exemplifies this trend by employing CFPs, CPAs, and CFAs who collaborate closely with AI engineers to build smarter financial tools.\n- Increased Tax Revenues: \u201cHigher productivity usually leads to higher corporate profits, wages, and economic activity\u2014all of which generate increased tax receipts,\u201d Batra says. \u201cMore government revenue means less need to borrow.\u201d\n- Disinflationary Pressure: \u201cLess government borrowing leads to lower inflationary pressure,\u201d Batra says. \u201cIn addition, productivity improvements reduce the cost of producing goods and services, which slows down inflation.\u201d\n- Improved Debt Dynamics & Lower Rates: Lower inflation means the Federal Reserve can lower interest rates, which helps stimulate the economy and allows the government to spend less on interest expense and spend more money on the private sector.\nWhat\u2019s more, we\u2019re already seeing measurable productivity gains in industries that have integrated AI tools into their workflow. Even if policymakers fail to rein in spending in the coming years, AI-driven productivity gains in the private sector may allow us to \u201cgrow our way\u201d out of fiscal distress.\n\u201cIf AI delivers even modest incremental productivity gains of 1-1.5% annually, the US could potentially maintain or reduce current debt-to-GDP levels despite continued spending growth,\u201d Batra says.\nAI Is Transforming, Not Destroying the Job Market\nYes, the rise of AI has resulted in people losing their jobs. This, however, is not a new phenomenon.\nTake farming, for example. Around 70% of people were employed in agriculture in the early 1800s, but that number is now less than 2% thanks to the creation of farming machines and other advancements.\nAt the same time, technological innovations not only created new jobs to replace the ones lost. They added new roles that previously never existed.\n\u201cRemarkably, 60% of the jobs people are employed in today didn't exist in 1940,\u201d Batra says. \u201cThat means nearly 90% of employment growth over the last 80 years resulted from technology creating entirely new categories of work.\u201d\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s Future of Jobs Report estimates that AI and related technologies will create a net gain of 78 million new roles this decade.\nRange is living proof of this. They\u2019ve hired CFPs, CPAs, and CFAs as critical subject matter experts to help their AI engineers build and validate their platform.\n\u201cThese aren't traditional roles\u2014they represent the emergence of new types of knowledge workers who combine domain expertise with technological fluency,\u201d Batra says.\nHow You Could Bring the Power of AI Into Your Wealth Management With Range\nIn just four short years, Range has signed up almost 2,000 high income members and advises them on more than $6 billion in assets.\nCurrently in beta, Range\u2019s proprietary AI engine is capable of delivering financial insights and guidance in seconds, potentially allowing you to capitalize on opportunities and avoid any potential pitfalls \u2014 for example, if you should buy an investment property or if you can retire early based on your complete financial picture\nRange also operates on a flat-fee pricing model and offers portfolio management with 0% Assets Under Management fees, so you won\u2019t pay more as your net worth continues to grow.\nDisclaimers\nPlease be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

      "text": "A 26-year-old law student called into \u201cThe Ramsey Show\u201d with what started as a financial question and quickly became a conversation about honesty, trust and marriage readiness.\nToday's Best Finance Deals\nHeir To $1 Million, But She Has No Idea\nThe caller, Nathaniel, explained that he inherited about $1 million a few years ago. The money is held in a trust account that he controls, and it\u2019s managed by a financial adviser using a low-risk, principal-protection strategy.\n\u201cI treat it like a sacred gift from God,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I have a responsibility to be a really excellent steward of it.\u201d\nDon't Miss:\n- Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share.\n- Invest where it hurts \u2014 and help millions heal: Invest in Cytonics and help disrupt a $390B Big Pharma stronghold.\nHe said he\u2019s getting married soon. His fianc\u00e9e, a pianist, has no assets or liabilities and plans to be a stay-at-home mom. They\u2019ve been together nearly four years. But she doesn't know about the inheritance\u2014and neither do her parents, who are at the center of Nathaniel's dilemma.\nHer parents, retired and living in China, mortgaged their fully paid-off apartment to invest in a risky venture that failed. They are now roughly $25,000 in debt. Nathaniel said they haven't asked him for help, but he's been wondering if it would be wrong not to help them.\n\u201cWould I be a jerk not to?\u201d he asked. \u201cPart of me doesn't really feel like using my money, soon to be our money, to help people who, in retirement, mortgaged their only safe asset for leverage in a single risky investment.\u201d\nRamsey: You Can't Marry Someone You\u2019re Hiding This From\nDave Ramsey and co-host Jade Warshaw were transparent: the financial question comes second.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t go another day promising to marry somebody and you\u2019re keeping secrets from them,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cUnhealthy, dude.\u201d\nHe urged Nathaniel to have a serious, honest conversation with his fianc\u00e9e immediately.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t trust them, you don\u2019t need to be able to marry them,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cIf you have to deceive someone because you\u2019re worried about their authenticity, we don\u2019t marry them.\u201d\nWarshaw added that the issue reflects more on Nathaniel than his future in-laws.\n\u201cHonestly, that\u2019s more on his authenticity than hers,\u201d she said. \u201cNathaniel, you\u2019re more of the problem here than they are.\u201d\nSee Also: Maximize saving for your retirement and cut down on taxes: Schedule your free call with a financial advisor to start your financial journey \u2013 no cost, no obligation.\nHelping Or Enabling?\nRamsey acknowledged that $25,000 is a small amount relative to Nathaniel\u2019s wealth and paying it off would have \u201cabsolutely no impact on your life.\u201d But he warned against enabling repeated financial mistakes.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that if they\u2019re going to turn around and do the same kind of stupid stuff again,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to get under the hood and find out what\u2019s broken. Is this like a pattern? Have we learned our lesson?\u201d\nIn the end, Ramsey said the in-laws\u2019 debt is a secondary issue that the couple should discuss after Nathaniel fully discloses his financial situation.\n\u201cNine out of 10, Nathaniel needs to come clean. One out of 10, pay off the 25K or don\u2019t,\u201d Ramsey said.\nRead Next: Are you rich?

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nThree of the same VC firms that backed Uber, Venmo, and eBay, respectively, are all investing in another private company: Pacaso.\nVenture backing in companies like Pacaso is nothing new. After all, early-stage companies often have the potential to deliver the most outsized returns.\nBut, recent regulatory updates have opened the door for individual investors to invest alongside these venture capitalists. Normally, everyday investors have to wait for a company to go public before they can invest, missing out on that early gain potential. Now, some companies are opening up investment opportunities to the public.\nThis type of investing has already seen some great success stories. For example, in 2016, 433 people invested an average of $2,730 in a private startup named Revolut. Fast-forward to today, those $2,730 stakes are worth over $1 million, up 89,900%.\nToday, thousands of investors have joined big-name VCs in taking a chance on Pacaso. It's no surprise, considering Pacaso's resum\u00e9:\n- The company has made $110M in gross profits to date\n- Pacaso's co-founder sold his last company to Zillow for $120M\n- They operate in over 40 vacation destinations across the US, Mexico, UK, and France\n- The company reserved the Nasdaq ticker PCSO\nBut the growth potential is where the excitement is. Below we'll reveal more about how Pacaso has ramped up and built a competitive moat so quickly, and how you can share in their growth.\nNext-Generation Co-Ownership\nAfter his $120M exit and subsequent role as a Zillow executive, Austin Allison created Pacaso\u2019s game-changing co-ownership model. Powered by proprietary tech and an innovative structure that eliminates the headaches of traditional vacation home ownership, it\u2019s already leaving a mark. Here\u2019s how:\n- Seamless Transactions: Clients easily buy, finance, and resell, shares of luxury homes through Pacaso\u2019s intuitive platform\n- Turnkey Ownership: Pacaso handles maintenance, scheduling, and furnishing; owners simply enjoy their vacation homes\n- Maximized Value: Homes that once sat empty up to 90% of the year now stay occupied nearly year-round, benefiting owners and local economies\nThe demand for their services and expertise is real. In top destinations, co-ownership is growing 21% annually in the US, and Pacaso homes have appreciated nearly 10% since 2021 \u2013 roughly double the growth of the broader luxury market.\nScaling Into 10 New International Destinations\nPacaso is already leading the charge in the $1.3 trillion US vacation home market, combining real estate innovation with tech-driven efficiency to generate multiple revenue streams. These include transaction service fees on every sale, recurring property management fees, and exclusive financing options tailored to co-owners.\nNow, the platform\u2019s global reach is growing quickly, and they\u2019re already seeing strong returns in the $500B global market. In 2024, they set records in Paris and London. Meanwhile, Cabo (Mexico) is the #3-most-searched destination on their platform. No surprise Europe and Mexico have accounted for 22% of their revenue over the past two years.\nNow, they\u2019re taking international expansion to an entirely new level. They recently announced 10 new international destinations will be added to their platform, spread across Italy, the Caribbean, and Mexico. That means Pacaso\u2019s unique model is poised to dominate a combined $1.8T in vacation home markets.\nWhy Investors Are Paying Attention\nThere are many reasons why firms managing a combined $180B+ in assets, and 10,000+ individual investors have already backed Pacaso, including:\n- Proven Leadership: Allison is joined by executives with decades of real-estate and startup experience.\n- Strong Growth Metrics: Full-year 2024 financials showed a 21% YoY increase in gross real estate volume and a 24% improvement in adjusted EBITDA.\n- Surging Demand: 40% of Americans want to buy a vacation home in the next year (Coldwell Banker)\nAfter impressive full-year earnings showed gross profit grew 41%, and with continued growth and expansion ahead, Pacaso is really hitting their stride.\nPacaso is offering securities through the use of an Offering Statement that has been qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Tier II of Regulation A. A copy of the Final Offering Circular that forms a part of the Offering Statement may be obtained from: invest.pacaso.com.
