      "summary": "Vonnie Quinn reports that U.S. consumer sentiment has dipped for the first time since April as inflation expectations climb, prompting a cautious outlook on Fed policy.  Fed officials and market analysts expect a modest 25‑basis‑point rate cut in September, but only if labor market weakness intensifies, while the Fed remains wary of a sharp easing.  Credit markets continue to show a high‑yield supply boom and resilient fundamentals, though investors remain vigilant about potential risks from tariff policy and geopolitical events.  The upcoming Jackson Hole symposium will be pivotal for clarifying the Fed’s stance on inflation and employment.",
