  "description": "AI is a proven game-changer for businesses seeking a competitive advantage. And while AI adoption rates have been defined as \u201cunprecedented\u201d by experts, only the most forward-thinking leaders are focusing on what powers these systems",
  "content": "AI has emerged as a powerful tool for businesses looking for a competitive edge. But success is not guaranteed by adoption alone. AI power users understand that peak performance is tied directly to the quality of the information fed into their systems.\n\nYour company\u2019s first-party data has always been a valuable differentiator. Today, in the AI era, your data is worth more than ever before. Businesses of all sizes now have the opportunity to benefit from sophisticated pattern recognition and predictive insights, all customized to meet their unique goals. However, unleashing this potential requires overcoming challenges that kept data locked away historically.\n\nTo effectively utilize first-party data for AI, marketing leaders must break down organizational and intelligence silos, connecting data sets, teams, and business outcomes. This is the key to achieving new levels of data strength and ROI. In this article, we\u2019ll share practical tips on how to do just that.\n\nMany businesses have lots of data but struggle to use it. That's because customer information is often scattered across separate systems\u2014like sales records, website analytics, and in-store purchases. When your data is disconnected, you can't see the full picture, which limits the power of your AI. The solution is to build data strength.\n\nThink of data strength as a score for your data readiness and the value and variety of signal types you source. It helps you internally rate your data capabilities and understand two key things:\n\u2022 Which data you should invest in: It shows you where to focus your efforts and which signal types may add additional value.\n\u2022 How ready you are for activation: It evaluates your ability to connect disparate data systems with your AI.\n\nThe goal is to centralize all of your data sources to build a single, complete view of your customer for use in your digital marketing. When your data is strong and fully integrated, you get much better results and a higher return on investment. Here\u2019s how to get started.\n\nFour steps top advertisers take to improve their data strength\n\n1. Connect all of your data sources, securely\n\nThe first step of your journey is to connect all of your data sources to one centralized system. This addresses data silos across your business, allowing you to overcome performance issues that arise from scattered information.\n\nstreamlines data connectivity by offering direct connection workflows for and API capabilities within a single tool, simplifying data flow management and troubleshooting. It also helps advertisers improve signal capture by allowing them to convert third-party tags to first-party tags. Using tools like , which is a lightweight solution with built-in privacy benefits that doesn't require retagging, can lead to an average increase of 11% in marketing signals.2\n\n2. Maximize the quality of your data\n\nOnce the pipes are connected, the next step is to ensure your data is as strong as possible. Expanding the variety of signal types you ingest helps AI deliver more insightful recommendations, allowing you to maximize the impact of your investments.\n\nThis is a crucial step that relies on technical implementation on your site or by ingesting data into your own sales and data systems. We recommend prioritizing a variety signal types:\n\u2022 Advertising signals: How your audience interacts with your ads, from where they click to what campaigns are driving the most interest.\n\u2022 Customer signals: Information that customers share with you, such as emails and phone numbers, to better understand their behavior across different devices.\n\u2022 Transactional signals: Determine the true value of a purchase or other key actions, ensuring you can accurately understand the impact of your marketing efforts and prevent counting the same conversion more than once.\n\u2022 Behavioral signals: Gain a deeper understanding of the customer journey, learning what actions users take on your website and how they engage with your content.\n\nWith your robust, high-quality data in place, you're ready to activate it. This is where the tangible value of your data strength is realized, transforming basic information into actionable performance improvements.\n\nLeverage AI-driven advertising platforms, such as Google Ads, to utilize your data as a crucial input across diverse applications.\n\u2022 Audiences: Discover preferred audiences and create new, similar audiences, so you can expand your reach.\n\u2022 Bidding: Use AI-powered bidding strategies that use your data to find new opportunities to optimize your bids in real time.\n\u2022 In-channel optimization: Advanced attribution models can understand exactly what drives sales within any given channel so you can optimize accordingly.\n\nTo demonstrate gains unlocked by your data you should take a modern approach to ads measurement. A strong data foundation allows you to accurately measure the KPIs that matter most to your business, such as revenue and profit. This involves using a to prove the effectiveness of your advertising efforts:\n\u2022 Cross-channel optimization: Beyond simply measuring clicks, advanced attribution models help you understand which media touchpoints provide the most value. This includes multi-touch attribution, a cross-channel approach that interprets how much different channels influence the customer journey.\n\u2022 Incrementality experiments: Testing things like geo and conversion lift allow you to measure the true, incremental impact of your campaigns. Using a test and control arm approach you can determine whether an ad caused a conversion, rather than just being present in the user's journey.\n\u2022 Marketing mix modeling (MMM): These models use advanced statistics to correlate your marketing investments with sales, helping you optimize budgets across all your marketing channels and understand the overall contribution of different media.\n\nBy embracing these modern measurement practices, you can move beyond simple last-click metrics and gain a holistic view of your advertising's impact, proving the value of your data strength to the business.\n\nCultivating robust data strength is essential for driving demonstrable business outcomes in today's competitive landscape. It enables businesses to foster stronger customer relationships and significantly increase customer lifetime value.\n\nAI anchored on rich first-party data fuels intelligent bidding optimization, ensuring your budget is deployed with maximum impact and efficiency. This isn't merely about refining current campaigns; it's about strategically empowering your organization for a future of growth. Forward-thinking business leaders must recognize superior data strength as an indispensable prerequisite for unlocking the full potential of advanced AI applications.",

      "text": "Google Ads Data Manager is a data import and management tool with a point-and-click UI experience that lets you bring your customer data from outside of Google and activate it in Google Ads.

      "text": "CMOs and CROs are in a tough position. Not only is there increasing pressure to connect ad budgets to business outcomes, but analytics professionals\u2014the people relied upon to make the numbers work\u2014 are looking for better performance from their legacy measurement technology. In fact, in a recent study from BCG and Google, we found that only 40% of global organizations completely trust the performance of their current measurement solutions.\nTo address this, leading companies are implementing AI-backed technology powered by rich first-party data to better understand their campaign\u2019s performance, run experiments, and more accurately predict the impact of future media investments.\nWhat solution can do all of this? It\u2019s actually a combination of three tools. Marketing Mix Models (MMMs) for a macro view of past and future performance, incrementality testing to identify best-performing channels and tactics through experimentation, and attribution analysis to optimize budget allocation. When used together, these tools provide a comprehensive and trusted understanding of marketing effectiveness, breaking down silos and enabling data-driven growth.\nCover your bases with a three-step approach to measurement\nTo get a clear picture of their media\u2019s performance, marketers must embrace an integrated measurement toolkit with three key parts: MMMs, incrementality testing, and attribution. Each of these approaches are widely used by data teams across the globe on their own \u2014 our survey showed 79% adoption for MMMs, 86% for incrementality testing, and 81% for attribution. But the real magic happens, when all three are used together. Today, only 46% of organizations use all three of these tools concurrently. We believe this number plays a major role in low trust levels among analytics professionals. To fully address the top six characteristics of a modern measurement approach, a three-step measurement process is essential.\nWhen you overlay the strengths of each measurement approach, you see that each tool provides a critical part of the complete picture of marketing performance. They each offer distinct strengths across critical dimensions like causality, actionability, and recency. And when you integrate different insights in strategic ways \u2014 like adding incrementality experiment results to your MMM, you are able to leverage their complementary capabilities, enabling cross-verification of results and building a complete and trustworthy understanding of your marketing's impact.\nEmbrace AI-backed technology to unlock advanced capabilities\nMarketers recognize the potential of AI to address common challenges in measurement. Globally, 72% of analytics professionals \u201cfrequently leverage AI\u201d within their measurement efforts, signalling that the industry is beginning to view traditional methods as insufficient on their own. But even amid AI enthusiasm, a concerning reality is taking shape: when we benchmark AI maturity across marketing functions \u2014 or how advanced people feel their AI usage is \u2014 measurement consistently lags. While media and personalization, creative production, and even operational processes show higher levels of perceived AI acumen, only 9% of global companies consider their AI capabilities \u201cleading\u201d when it comes to measurement. This contrast reveals a significant gap between AI adoption and mastery for measurement related use cases.\nCompanies paving the way for AI-powered measurement are giving us deeper visibility into how these tools can drive sharp, future-forward strategies. According to BCG, leading organizations leverage AI over twice as much as competitors, with 76% of these leaders currently using AI to generate actionable learnings from their campaigns. What\u2019s more, nearly half of leading users are already using AI powered features like predictive modeling and forecasting to shape forward-looking strategies in smart ways.\nDeepen your understanding by improving your data strength\nThe majority of brands are still working out the best ways to deploy AI across their businesses and a key observation from these industry-wide efforts is that without clean, connected data, even the most advanced AI tools struggle to deliver impactful results. In 2025, 42% of surveyed companies across the globe still lack a CRM, and 57% don't have a CDP\u2014the very technologies required to unify and activate customer data. These deficiencies can lead to fragmented insights, with 29% of marketers reporting limited data availability and only 24% achieving a 360-degree view of their customers.\nTo fully leverage the untapped power of AI measurement, brands must unify first-party data from across their systems. Incorporating data across different sources \u2013 spanning offline, online, transactional, and more \u2013 into your MMM for example can help to uplevel the model\u2019s performance and provide the comprehensive understanding needed for more effective recommendations. This critical step demands close attention from leadership to align internal teams. As Derek Rodenhausen, Managing Director at BCG, recently stated at a measurement industry event, \u201c30% of the battle is getting the right KPIs and toolkit, the other 70% is getting the right people and processes in place to enable those KPIs and tools to really work.\u201d\nMeet the moment with an integrated approach to measurement\nThe future of marketing measurement hinges on brands\u2019 ability to merge three essential solutions \u2014 MMM, incrementality testing, and attribution \u2014 and, crucially, to support this integrated framework with the power of advanced AI and clean, connected data. Those who are leveraging all three measurement approaches already recognize their transformative potential, with 8 out of 10 intending to increase their usage in the coming years. This signals a growing understanding that true measurement confidence comes from a holistic view, powered by intelligent technologies.\nBrands can no longer afford to rely on a disjointed, uncertain approach to measurement. As CMOs and executive leaders everywhere continue to call for proof of returns, marketers need confidence and accuracy. Developing a fully-integrated, AI-backed measurement strategy alongside a robust data foundation is the key to driving sustainable business growth during this ROI reckoning."
