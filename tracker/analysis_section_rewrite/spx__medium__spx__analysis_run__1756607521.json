      "feedback": "The draft is solidly focused on the S&P 500 concentration, Fed policy, inflation and tariff‑driven headwinds, and it delivers a clear 3–6‑month base case, risks, watch signals and confidence. To tighten it to Argos standards, add a concise second‑alternative scenario (e.g., a September rate cut coupled with unexpectedly strong tech earnings that dampens concentration risk, yielding a 0–2 % upside). Explicitly reference the 10‑year Treasury yield (≈4.0 % today) and the Fed’s policy rate (≈5.25 %) to anchor the term‑premium discussion, and note the current S&P 500 level relative to its 200‑day MA (≈4 % above). Include a short mention of the VIX (≈20) as a proxy for equity risk‑premium and the expected impact of a 10–15 bp cut on the term premium. Finally, sharpen the watch‑list signals: Q2 earnings of the top‑10 constituents, the September Fed minutes, July CPI/ core‑PCE, the Fed’s policy rate decision, and the PMI for the tech sector. These edits will reinforce the causal chain, provide quantitative anchors, and satisfy the 3–6‑month scenario‑catalyst format.",
