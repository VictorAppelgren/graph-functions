  "content": "NEW YORK, Aug. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP is investigating claims on behalf of investors of Fortinet, Inc. (\"Fortinet\" or the \"Company\") FTNT. Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, ext. 7980.\n\nThe investigation concerns whether Fortinet and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices.\n\n[Click here for information about joining the class action]\n\nOn August 6, 2025, Fortinet reported disappointing second quarter 2025 financial results. In response, Investor's Business Daily quoted William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho as stating, \"Investors were left confused by the company's formal statement that 40% to 50% of its accelerated firewall refresh (estimated to be a $450 million, 650,000 unit opportunity) was now completed. This is driving confusion about why Fortinet is not seeing stronger product revenue growth and billings materialize.\"\n\nOn this news, Fortinet's stock price fell $21.28 per share, or 22.03%, to close at $75.30 per share on August 7, 2025.\n\nPomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 85 years later, Pomerantz continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomlaw.com.",
