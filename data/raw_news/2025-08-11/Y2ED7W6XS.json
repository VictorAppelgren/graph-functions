  "content": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Daryl Hall and John Oates have resolved their dispute over a Hall & Oates business partnership through arbitration, reaching a private ending after details of their rift went public in court documents filed in a 2023 lawsuit by Hall against Oates, according to a court filing Monday.\n\nIn Monday\u2019s status report, attorneys for Hall noted the case received a final judgment in arbitration and they filed a proposed order for the judge, Nashville Chancellor Russell Perkins, to dismiss the case. In mid-July, Perkins ordered Hall\u2019s attorneys to offer an update in the case, which had last seen a public filing in December 2023.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when the arbitration process was finalized. And details were not revealed about the arbitration outcome between the duo who made music together for more than a half century, including hits in the 1970s and \u201980s such as \u201cManeater,\u201d \u201cRich Girl\u201d \u201cKiss on My List\u201d and \u201cI Can\u2019t Go for That (No Can Do).\u201d\n\nRobb Harvey, an attorney for Hall, declined to comment. Representatives for Oates did not immediately respond to The Associated Press\u2019 request for comment.\n\nIn 2023 filings in the case, Hall accused Oates of blindsiding and betraying him, saying their relationship and his trust in Oates have deteriorated. Oates replied that he was \u201cdeeply hurt\u201d that Hall was making \u201cinflammatory, outlandish, and inaccurate statements\u201d about him.\n\nThe judge had paused the sale of Oates\u2019 stake in Whole Oats Enterprises LLP to Primary Wave IP Investment Management LLC. Whole Oats includes valuable Hall & Oates materials such as trademarks, personal name and likeness rights, record royalty income and website and social media assets, a court declaration says.\n\nThe dispute went public in November 2023, when Hall filed the lawsuit asking the judge to stop the sale by Oates so private arbitration could begin.\n\nHall gave a scathing account of their relationship in early November 2023 during arbitration, and it was made public later in the month in the lawsuit. It alleges that Oates and his team engaged in the \u201cultimate partnership betrayal\u201d by pushing to sell his share while telling Hall\u2019s associates that he wanted to maintain his ownership.\n\nIn his own declaration, Oates expressed disappointment with his longtime partner\u2019s words, saying Hall\u2019s accusations that Oates went behind his back and breached their agreement aren\u2019t true. Oates declined to go into specifics, saying he\u2019s obligated to keep details private, even if Hall didn\u2019t.\n\nLast year, Oates told The Associated Press that he\u2019s had \u201cno communication\u201d with Hall and declined to discuss the legal proceedings. He did not see a Hall & Oates reunion in his future.\n\n\u201cI personally don\u2019t see it happening. It\u2019s not in my plans at all. You can ask Daryl Hall what he thinks. But for me personally, no,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Times asked Hall in February if the ship had sailed on mending the pair\u2019s relationship.\n\n\u201cThat ship has gone to the bottom of the ocean,\u201d Hall told the news outlet. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of surprises in my life, disappointments, betrayals, so I\u2019m kind of used to it.\u201d\n\nMaria Sherman in New York contributed to this report.",
