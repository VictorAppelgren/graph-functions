  "argos_summary": "The article discusses a list of 518 undervalued global stocks identified by a cash\u2011flow screener, highlighting two Chinese manufacturers as examples. Chongqing Qianli Technology (601777) is trading below its DCF\u2011based fair value of CN\u00a517.8, with projected earnings growth of 60% per year and a modest debt\u2011to\u2011equity ratio of 15.5%, but its price\u2011to\u2011sales ratio is high relative to the auto industry. Suzhou Dongshan Precision Manufacturing (002384) also appears undervalued, with a fair value estimate of CN\u00a560.94, strong revenue growth, and a healthy balance sheet, yet its price\u2011to\u2011sales ratio exceeds the electronics industry average. Both companies show promising cash\u2011flow potential and could be attractive for value\u2011oriented investors, though each carries sector\u2011specific risks.",
