      "summary": "The Trump administration announced a U.S. military strike on a Venezuelan boat in the Caribbean, claiming it carried narcotics and was linked to a designated terrorist cartel. The strike, carried out by aircraft, has raised questions about compliance with international maritime law and human rights conventions, with experts labeling it a potential violation of international law. The administration has yet to disclose details of the operation or the legal authority used, and is expected to report its rationale to Congress by a set deadline. This unprecedented escalation could set a dangerous precedent for future U.S. actions against drug traffickers abroad.",
