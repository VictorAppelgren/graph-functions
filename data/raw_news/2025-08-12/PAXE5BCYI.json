  "title": "JPM\u2019s Peters Sees Equities 7%-8% Higher Over Next 12 Months",
  "description": "Grace Peters, global investment strategy co-head at JPMorgan Private Bank, says the pain trade \u201cbroadly lies to the upside\u201d and explains the differentiation she sees between the US economy and equity market. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "The bond market is smelling a slowdown and we're starting to see evidence of that. The equity market is let's go. Everything looks good. Is there a difference there that I need to worry about in the kind of balanced portfolios? I think about how I should be investing right now? How should I be thinking about the world going forward from here? How are you thinking about the world? And what are your clients asking you about Money? Yeah, I think to me there's there is a slowdown ahead. I think there's a recession ahead. But we're absolutely seeing growth slow. Inflation is going to rise. I think we're going to see a CPI print that's on the hot side today. That's certainly what the market's expecting. And I think that trend will continue through the end of the year before tailing back to around two and a half percent next year. Okay. What I think is very important when it comes to equities or indeed credit markets risk assets at large, is that I do think that the market and the economy are in any way the same When we think about corporate earnings season that we've just had second quarter for the US, we saw 10% earnings growth that followed 12% in the first quarter. All of this being at a time when we had lackluster GDP. You know, we now in a downward revisions to the labor market. And so you're seeing very clearly this differentiation being drawn out between the market, which is driven by structural trends, predominantly artificial intelligence and the economy that I think is going to see this more stagflation We backdrop in the second half of this year converging. There's no kind of the markets seem to be keep doing its own thing. The economy can keep doing it. So do you think the market will continue rising? I think there's obviously going to be an equity market and I think credit will still corporate credit will continue to do well. Also, there's going to be bouts of volatility. Nothing moves in a straight line. But I think that the earnings backdrop and of course the balance sheets supporting those earnings, importing the investments is pretty robust. So I think investors are going to be continue to be surprised that the pain train brutalized to the upside and you're still going to get another 7 to 8% out of equities over the next 12 months and probably 6% out of out of credit as well.",
