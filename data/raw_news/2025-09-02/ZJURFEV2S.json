  "title": "Rihanna Charts Her Second New Hit Of 2025 \u2014 Despite Cries For More Music From Fans",
  "description": "Rihanna\u2019s \u201cBreakin\u2019 Dishes\u201d debuts at No. 40 on the Official Singles chart and becomes her twentieth hit on the U.K. Streaming Songs list.",
  "content": "Rihanna\u2019s \u201cBreakin\u2019 Dishes\u201d was never released as a single when it arrived on Good Girl Gone Bad back in 2007. Nearly two decades later, the fan favorite is finally enjoying a proper chart run. After months of going viral and bouncing around on various tallies, the track makes its debut on multiple rankings in the United Kingdom this frame.\n\n\u201cBreakin\u2019 Dishes\u201d opens at No. 40 on the Official Singles chart. The track gives Rihanna another top 40 win on the U.K.\u2019s main tally of the most consumed songs in the nation. The years-old cut marks her first new entry inside that region since \u201cLift Me Up\u201d from Black Panther: Wakanda Forever peaked at No. 3 in 2022.\n\nRihanna\u2019s Second New Hit of 2025\n\nWhile much of the conversation around the singer has been about her lack of new music, \u201cBreakin\u2019 Dishes\u201d is actually Rihanna\u2019s second debut on the Official Singles chart this year. Earlier in 2025, \u201cFriend of Mine,\u201d which she wrote and recorded for the Smurfs movie, launched at No. 72, though it disappeared quickly.\n\nOn the Official Streaming chart, \u201cBreakin\u2019 Dishes\u201d debuts at No. 89. The arrival is notable as it\u2019s Rihanna\u2019s milestone twentieth appearance on the tally. Her last entry on the streaming-only list came in January 2024, when \u201cLove The Way You Lie\u201d with Eminem briefly hit No. 100, long after its initial run on other rosters.\n\nNew Peak on the Hip-Hop and R&B Singles Chart\n\n\u201cBreakin\u2019 Dishes\u201d improves on the Official Hip-Hop and R&B Singles chart at the same time it opens on several other lists. This frame, Rihanna\u2019s tune climbs from No. 11 to a new high of No. 7. It has now spent 18 weeks on the ranking, and as it surges, the composition becomes Rihanna\u2019s forty-first top 10 hit.\n\nIn addition to \u201cBreakin\u2019 Dishes,\u201d several of Rihanna\u2019s biggest smashes continue to perform well on the Official Hip-Hop and R&B Singles list. \u201cDon\u2019t Stop The Music\u201d lifts to No. 26, \u201cS&M\u201d climbs to No. 27, \u201cStay\u201d with Mikky Ekko moves to No. 29, and \u201cLove The Way You Lie\u201d with Eminem advances to No. 30. Each of these tracks has previously peaked inside the top two on the genre-focused roster.",
