  "title": "Trump says he\u2019s ordering new census",
  "description": "The attempt would likely face a flurry of legal and logistical challenges should the administration move ahead with it.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump on Thursday said he was ordering a \u201cnew and highly accurate CENSUS,\u201d saying it will be based on the \u201cinformation gained from the Presidential Election of 2024.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople who are in our country illegally will NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS,\u201d he wrote in the Truth Social post announcing the move.\n\nThe census is a constitutionally mandated count of every person in the United States every 10 years, which was last conducted in 2020. A full census has never been conducted mid-decade in this manner, nor has one ever excluded noncitizens from the count.\n\nCensuses are immensely important in American governance; each count determines how many House seats every state gets through a process called apportionment, and the results of the census help direct billions of dollars in federal, state and local funding.\n\nTrump has been trying to include a citizenship question on the census since his first term, though the Supreme Court struck the effort down on procedural grounds in 2019. Apportionment numbers have also historically included people residing in the United States regardless of their immigration status.\n\nA 2020 Pew Research Center report indicated removing noncitizens could cost multiple states House seats, including California and Texas.\n\nAny attempt to do a mid-decade census would likely result in a flurry of legal and logistical challenges. Preparing for the decennial count takes multiple years, and planning for the 2030 census is already well underway.\n\nIt is unclear how the Trump administration plans to exclude undocumented people from the count, or if the president intended to just remove them from apportionment totals, which would also face legal hurdles.\n\nThe president\u2019s announcement comes as several states have entered a redistricting battle. Trump has pushed for red states like Texas to gerrymander House maps to maintain control of the chamber, saying Republicans are \u201centitled\u201d to the seats. Democrats have promised to respond in kind.\n\nSome Republican allies of the president \u2014 including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2014 have urged the president to try to launch a new count, arguing the previous count was \u201cflawed.\u201d\n\nThe 2020 census, which was conducted almost entirely under Trump\u2019s first term, was roiled by the pandemic. The release of the results for the census was ultimately delayed until early 2021, under then-President Joe Biden, which scuttled Trump\u2019s attempt to exclude noncitizens from apportionment totals.\n\nThe Census Bureau acknowledged in a 2022 report that Black people, Hispanics and Native Americans were likely undercounted, while white and Asian people were overcounted. While some degree of under- or overcount happens every census, the pandemic likely exacerbated the challenge.\n\nIn January, then-Census Bureau Director Robert Santos resigned midway through his term, citing a desire to spend more time with his family. He had been appointed by Biden after his predecessor resigned following allegations from government watchdogs that he was pressuring bureau employees to rush a report on the number of immigrants in the country.\n\nSantos' resignation has paved the way for Trump to appoint an ally to lead the agency, although he has yet to nominate a candidate.\n\nPlanning for the census typically takes the length of a decade, so it could be difficult to conduct one soon. Even if they do wait for 2030, federal law requires that census questions be submitted to Congress two years before a count is conducted, so Trump \u2014 whose term ends in 2029 \u2014 could still influence the questions.",

      "text": "Since the first census of the United States in 1790, counts that include both citizens and noncitizens have been used to apportion seats in the House of Representatives, with states gaining or losing based on population change over the previous decade. If unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. were removed from the 2020 census apportionment count \u2013 which the White House seeks to do \u2013 three states could each lose a seat they otherwise would have had and three others each could gain one, according to a Pew Research Center analysis based on government records.\nIf unauthorized immigrants were excluded from the apportionment count, California, Florida and Texas would each end up with one less congressional seat than they would have been awarded based on population change alone. California would lose two seats instead of one, Florida would gain one instead of two, and Texas would gain two instead of three, according to analysis based on projections of Census Bureau 2019 population estimates and the Center\u2019s estimates of the unauthorized immigrant population.\nThis blog post explores the role of the nation\u2019s unauthorized immigrant population in apportionment of congressional seats. Every decade, the U.S. Census Bureau conducts a count of all people living in the country, which is then used to distribute seats in the House of Representatives to the states. The analysis in this blog post is based on projections using Census Bureau population estimates, Pew Research Center estimates of the size of the unauthorized immigrant population and established formulas for assigning congressional seats.\nThe Method of Equal Proportions assigns congressional seats to states based on their populations after each state is given their first seat. The method requires 50 state population figures and assigns seats sequentially; it stops after the 435th seat is assigned. Our population figures for 2020 are based on the Census Bureau\u2019s official population estimates for 2018 and 2019 projected to April 1, 2020. We use these for our baseline apportionment.\nThe Pew Research Center has published estimates of the unauthorized immigrant population for states through 2017. The estimates for 2016 and 2017 show very little change, and external indications suggest few changes since then. Accordingly, we use our 2017 estimates for 2020 and subtract them from the total to provide the populations for an apportionment which excludes unauthorized immigrants.\nAlabama, Minnesota and Ohio would each hold onto a seat that they would have lost if apportionment were based only on total population change. Alabama filed a lawsuit in 2018 seeking to block the Census Bureau from including unauthorized immigrants in its population count.\nIn addition to these states, 11 more would gain or lose seats based on population change alone, whether unauthorized immigrants are included or excluded. Five states would gain one seat each: Arizona, Colorado, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon. Six states would lose one seat each: Illinois, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia.\nThe apportionment of seats in Congress is required by the U.S. Constitution, which says that the census will be used to divide the House of Representatives \u201camong the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State,\u201d except for enslaved people, who, until the late 1800s, were counted as three-fifths of a person, and certain American Indians. The 14th Amendment eliminated the partial count of enslaved people, and the total American Indian population was added later to congressional reapportionment calculations. The number of seats in the House was fixed at 435 following the 1910 census. Each state gets one seat, and the remainder are assigned according to a complex formula based on relative population size.\nThe census count includes everyone living in the United States, except for foreign tourists and business travelers in the country temporarily, according to Census Bureau rules. For apportionment purposes since 1990, military and civilian federal employees stationed abroad and their dependents are counted as living in a state if they provided a state address in their employment records. The District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and U.S. Island area populations are excluded from the apportionment total because they have no voting representation in Congress.\nFederal law requires the population totals from the decennial census be delivered to the president nine months after Census Day, meaning Dec. 31, 2020. The Census Bureau has requested Congress extend the deadline to April 30, 2021, due to the coronavirus pandemic, although the White House reportedly may push for a \u201ctimely census\u201d fueled by $1 billion in additional funding. States would redraw congressional district boundaries to fit the new totals. The results would take effect for the Congress that meets in 2023.\nIn his memorandum announcing a new policy \u201cto the extent practicable\u201d in how congressional seats are divided up, President Donald Trump asserted that the president has discretion to decide who is considered an inhabitant of the U.S. for apportionment purposes. Some of the same groups that successfully challenged the White House attempt to add a citizenship question to the census last year said they also would sue to block any change in apportionment policy. Democrats announced they would hold an emergency congressional hearing to respond.\nThe Census Bureau does not regularly publish counts or estimates of unauthorized immigrants, although the Department of Homeland Security has done so. Last year, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against including a question about citizenship on the 2020 census, the president ordered the Census Bureau to assemble a separate database, using other government records, on the citizenship status of every U.S. resident. This has also been challenged in court.\nThe Center\u2019s analysis relies on assumptions about populations to be counted in the 2020 census and estimates of unauthorized immigrants. The actual figures used for apportionment will be different from these, and so the actual apportionment could differ regardless of whether unauthorized immigrants are excluded from the apportionment totals."

The census is crucial for determining congressional representation and federal funding, and excluding noncitizens could result in several states losing House seats. Trump's previous attempts to add a citizenship question to the census were blocked by the Supreme Court, and any changes to apportionment policies are likely to provoke legal disputes from various groups.",
