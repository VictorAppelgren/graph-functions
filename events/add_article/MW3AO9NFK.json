      "summary": "BlackRock paused fundraising for its third Asia‑Pacific private credit fund after announcing its acquisition of HPS Investment Partners, adding uncertainty to its regional private‑credit ambitions. The firm had targeted roughly $1 billion, but the fund had secured less than half of that and faced challenges such as Arch Capital Group’s sale talks and a split with Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala over deal sourcing. The pause follows broader difficulties in the private‑credit market and reflects BlackRock’s strategy to solidify its private‑markets presence under Larry Fink, who has set a $400 billion fundraising goal by 2030.",
