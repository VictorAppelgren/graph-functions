      "summary": "Wildfires across Southern Europe—spanning Spain, Portugal, Greece, Italy, Turkey, and neighboring countries—have intensified amid a severe heat wave, with temperatures exceeding 104°F in many areas. Multiple major blazes have forced thousands to evacuate, closed highways and rail lines, and claimed several lives, while firefighting crews and aircraft are stretched thin. Heat alerts and high fire risk warnings have been issued by national meteorological agencies, and international aid has been mobilized to support overwhelmed local resources. The fires have also highlighted concerns over arson, power line faults, and careless farming practices as contributing factors.",
