      "feedback": "**Actionable edit instructions (compact paragraph):**  \n1. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly linking CPI → Fed policy → 10‑yr yield → equity discount rate → S&P 500, citing LZG5YWQMC for CPI, V7GV8YBQU for the S&P reaction, and SK994CBWR for yield expectations. 2. Quantify each leg: e.g., CPI 2.7% (July) → Fed likely to pause until Q4 2025 → 10‑yr yield falls to 3.5% (vs current 3.9%) → S&P lifts to 4,500 (vs 4,200). 3. Add an upside scenario (inflation 2.0% by Q1 2026, 10‑yr yield 3.0%, S&P 4,800) and a downside (inflation >2.5% into 2026, 10‑yr yield 4.0%, S&P 4,200). 4. Replace the generic “watch signals” with a concise list anchored to dates: July CPI release, Fed minutes (Oct 2025), OPEC+ production cuts (Nov 2025), U.S. crude inventories (Oct 2025), 10‑yr yield (weekly), S&P closing (weekly). 5. Remove the ACMR source (SK994CBWR) as it is company‑specific and not macro‑relevant; instead, cite the Fed’s policy rate (5.25‑5.5%) from the Fed’s own releases. 6. Integrate the oil supply narrative with J99EM2TPZ: 2.5 m bpd supply growth → oil near $70‑$75 → modest inflation relief; note fragility if OPEC+ cuts or geopolitical shocks push prices >$90. 7. Explicitly state fragility points: Fed misreading CPI, unexpected oil supply contraction, geopolitical supply‑chain shocks. 8. Ensure every claim has a citation ID; avoid generic platitudes. 9. Align the tone with a “medium‑term” horizon (Q4 2025‑Q2 2026) and keep the paragraph under 200 words.",
