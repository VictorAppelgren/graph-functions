      "feedback": "The draft meets the 5‑sentence limit and cites the source, but a few tweaks will tighten the causal logic and remove a weak link to the DXY. 1) In the risk sentence, combine the inflation‑up‑and‑housing‑demand risks into one clause: “Key risks include a Fed surprise cut or pause in the balance‑sheet contraction, which would compress the term premium and pull rates down 50‑100 bp, and a sharp uptick in inflation expectations or a surge in housing demand that could widen the real‑rate differential and push rates above 7.5 % (LF0UUL917).” 2) In the watch‑signals sentence, drop the DXY reference and replace it with a direct term‑premium effect: “Watch signals over the next 3‑6 months are the September Fed policy meeting, the August core PCE release, and the Treasury 10‑year yield/term‑premium spread; a spread falling below 30 bp would compress the term premium and pull mortgage rates down (LF0UUL917)(U21K4ALYQ).” 3) Keep the confidence sentence unchanged. These edits preserve the 4–6 sentence, executive‑style brief while ensuring every claim is a clear, directly causal link to mortgage rates with proper citations.",
