  "title": "Even the most devoted \u2018Sex and the City\u2019 fans were disgusted and disappointed by \u2018And Just Like That\u2019 \u2014 the Fyre Festival of TV shows",
  "description": "\u201cOver twenty years of watching this show, and this is what we get?\u201d lamented one \u201cSex and the City\u201d fan at a \u201cAnd Just Like That \u2026 \u201d viewing party.",
  "content": "\u201cAnd Just Like That \u2026 \u201d ended as it started: terribly.\n\nI\u2019m not the only \u201cSex and the City\u201d fan who thinks so. On Thursday, I attended a small viewing party for the finale of the reboot series with a group of pals who loved the original.\n\nLike me, the majority of them were disappointed and, yeah, disgusted.\n\n\u201cThis is unhinged!\u201d one \u2014 dressed as actress Lucy Liu from her 2001 \u201cSATC\u201d cameo \u2014 shouted as a shockingly gross scene played out. \u201cOver twenty years of watching this show, and this is what we get?\u201d\n\nWhat could have provoked such a response?\n\nThanksgiving dinner at Miranda\u2019s apartment, when a person named Epcot \u2014 yes, Epcot \u2014 clogged the toilet. Epcot is a friend of Mia, the hyper-flatulent girl knocked up by Miranda\u2019s son, Brady.\n\nBut the show\u2019s writers didn\u2019t think it enough to simply tell us about plumbing difficulties. They showed us. For at least 10 seconds, the remains of Epcot\u2019s day assaulted our eyes. It was gag-inducing and vile.\n\n(Not even \u201cDumb and Dumber\u201d went so far as to allow the results of Jeff Daniel\u2019s laxative-induced bathroom ordeal to appear on screen).\n\nAnd now, a glamorous franchise built on fashion, friendship and sex will be remembered for actual crap.\n\nRemember when fans were so excited for the premiere of \u201cAnd Just Like That \u2026 \u201d back in 2021? We were promised more time with the most fabulous friends the Big Apple has ever known.\n\nThat first episode brought us up to current day for the iconic characters\u2019 lives.\n\nMiranda had gone to grad school, unleashing a barrage of micro-aggressions at her black professor. Charlotte struggled with her tomboy (soon to identify as nonbinary) daughter not wanting to wear a frilly Oscar de la Renta dress. Carrie, responding to current industry trends, fired Samantha as her book publicist; in turn, Samantha cut everyone off and moved to London.\n\nWe met the \u201cqueer, nonbinary, Mexican Irish diva\u201d Che, who soon added another facet to \u201ctheir\u201d lengthy identity cluster: the most insufferable character to ever appear on HBO (or Max or whatever they\u2019re calling it these days)..\n\nIt was not an auspicious start.\n\nAnd still, I persevered through the woke morass. Even in this Season 3, as the series tried to extricate itself from the humorless pit of identity politics and limp toward the finish line with unrealistic plot lines and characters, poor acting \u2014 and far too much nudity from Cynthia Nixon, who disappeared the real Miranda so she could play herself.\n\nHow would they land the plane? I joked that maybe they wouldn\u2019t. Perhaps, en route to a girls\u2019 trip in Portugal, the ladies would all die in a fiery plane crash and put us all out of our misery.\n\nThat would have been brave and merciful.\n\nInstead, with Thursday\u2019s series finale, we were given a literal pile of crap.\n\nThankfully, HBO Max does not offer the scratch-and-sniff option.\n\nThe gross-out continued as Miranda, wearing rubber gloves to clean the sewage leak in her bathroom, is surprised by her girlfriend \u2014 who she excitedly embraces, rubbing those contaminated gloves all over her beloved\u2019s back.\n\nInstead of \u201cAwwww,\u201d the room I was in filled with a chorus of \u201cEwwww.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake off the filthy gloves!\u201d one friend yelled.\n\nIt was like the Fyre Festival of streaming TV.\n\nThe show wrapped up with a soulless montage showing the characters in their respective homes, eating the Thanksgiving pies Carrie had hand delivered earlier in the day.\n\nMeanwhile, Carrie returned to her massive Gramercy spread solo.\n\nShe took to her computer, erasing the epilogue of her novel set place in the 1800s \u2014 and instead wrote, \u201cThe woman realized she was not alone. She was on her own.\u201d\n\nAfter all that, Carrie ended up single in a home so big it could have eased our city\u2019s migrant housing issue.\n\nHer love story, which drove the entire franchise, became an afterthought.\n\nBut I did get a genuine laugh courtesy of \u201cSex and the City\u201d this week as I watched the new version of \u201cThe Naked Gun.\u201d In the movie, someone mentions Miranda Rights to the bumbling Lieutenant Frank Drebin Jr., ably played by Liam Neeson. He deadpans in response: \u201cNo Carrie writes. Miranda is the lawyer.\u201d\n\nAnd I couldn\u2019t help but wonder \u2026 if the stars and creators of \u201cAnd Just Like That \u2026 \u201d could go back in time and kill the series before it sullied a great legacy, would they?",

      "text": "Carrie Bradshaw\u2019s ending in \u2018And Just Like That\u2019 is a literal pile of crap\nThat\u2019s all Carrie Bradshaw wrote.\nThe \u201cSex and the City\u201d saga \u2013 which began in 1998 and concluded with the Season 3 finale of \u201cAnd Just Like That\u201d on Thursday night \u2013 ends in the toilet.\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s not a metaphor.\nFor some ungodly reason, the final episode of television featuring the iconic NYC writer Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) had a plotline involving showing an image of literal crap in a toilet on-screen. Seriously.\nIt\u2019s a little too on the nose.\nSpoilers ahead for \u201cParty Of One,\u201d the series finale of \u201cAnd Just Like That,\u201d now streaming on HBO Max.\nAfter Carrie Bradshaw has spent almost 30 years on the air, here\u2019s how her story ends in the series finale for the \u201cSex and the City\u201d spinoff, \u201cAnd Just Like That.\u201d\nAt the beginning of the episode, Carrie eats a meal alone at a futuristic restaurant.\nWhen the waitstaff puts a doll across from her, she later complains to her friends that she felt like she was being \u201cshamed\u201d for dining solo.\nCarrie tells Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and Charlotte (Kristin Davis): \u201cApparently, not only is it tragic for a woman to be alone in the past, it\u2019s also an issue in the future.\u201d\nShe was referring to the novel she\u2019s writing, which is about a woman in the 1800s.\nDuring last week\u2019s episode, Carrie met with her editor, who took issue with the fact that the novel ends with the heroine being alone.\nCarrie\u2019s editor called it a \u201ctragedy\u201d and said that she prefers \u201chappy endings,\u201d which was clearly the show thinking aloud about how Carrie\u2019s own romantic saga should end.\nCarrie maintained that she liked the way her novel ended, but she caved to her editor\u2019s wish in last week\u2019s episode and wrote an epilogue, implying that her heroine is alone now, but she will soon meet her friend\u2019s cousin, who is a \u201chandsome widower.\u201d\nLater in the series finale, Carrie tells Charlotte, \u201cI may be alone for the rest of my life.\u201d\nWhen Charlotte assures her that she\u2019ll find a new man, Carrie refers to the series premiere of \u201cAnd Just Like That,\u201d which killed off her longtime \u201cSex and the City\u201d love interest and husband, Big (Chris Noth).\n\u201cEven when Big died, after the shock and the total devastation, in the back of my mind, I thought, \u2018Aiden, maybe Aiden,\u2019\u201d she says.\nCarrie\u2019s other famous ex, Aiden (John Corbett), had an arc on \u201cAnd Just Like That\u201d Season 3, where he and Carrie rekindled their romance before they called it quits.\nShe then had a fling with her neighbor, Duncan (Jonathan Cake), but his work took him away from New York City.\nCarrie continues telling Charlotte, \u201cAnd recently, though Duncan clearly told me \u2018I\u2019m not coming back,\u2019 I thought, \u2018Maybe?\u2019 Hmm. But, I have to quit thinking \u2018maybe a man\u2019 and start accepting \u2018maybe just me.\u2019 And it\u2019s not a tragedy, it\u2019s a fact. And I just have to start accepting it, full stop.\u201d\nFollowing that conversation, Carrie attends an awkward Thanksgiving dinner.\nMiranda ditches her because her girlfriend Joy\u2019s (Dolly Wells) dog has an emergency.\nCharlotte also ditches her because her husband, Harry (Evan Handler), who had erectile dysfunction after his cancer, is suddenly able to perform.\nSo, Carrie is left alone with Miranda\u2019s son, Brady (Niall Cunningham), three of his annoying friends and Mark (Victor Garber), whom Charlotte invited to set up with Carrie, much to Carrie\u2019s dismay, since she complains that he\u2019s been married three times.\nThat\u2019s right \u2014 the bulk of Carrie\u2019s story ends with her at an awkward dinner party with a bunch of irritating new characters, and a date she doesn\u2019t want.\nWhat a way to end the story of a beloved TV character.\nAnd that\u2019s not all: one of Brady\u2019s irritating friends clogs the toilet. When Mark uses the bathroom later, the toilet overflows, and the camera pans to show the audience that there\u2019s s\u2013t in the toilet \u2014 really! \u2014 which encapsulates the direction in which the show has gone.\nAfter the toilet incident, Carrie goes home alone and turns on the song \u201cYou\u2019re The First, The Last, My Everything\u201d by Barry White.\nSmiling to herself, Carrie sits at her computer. She deletes the epilogue for her novel that implied her heroine will end up with a man.\nInstead, Carrie writes: \u201cThe woman realized she was not alone \u2013 she was on her own.\u201d\nAfter finishing her novel with that line, she keeps smiling and dancing around her apartment, singing along to the Barry White song. The implication is that Carrie has no romantic partner and is content.\nThe end credits then roll, playing the \u201cSex and the City\u201d theme song in the background.\nAnd just like that, with that steaming pile of crap \u2013 literally! \u2013 Carrie Bradshaw is finally off the air.\n\u201cSex and the City\u201d first premiered in 1998 and followed best friends Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha (Kim Cattrall, who only had a brief cameo in \u201cAnd Just Like That\u201d) through sex and dating adventures in the Big Apple.\nAfter the show ended in 2004, it had two movies in 2008 and 2010, before returning to follow Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda in their 50s when \u201cAnd Just Like That\u201d premiered in 2021.\nThe spinoff show has been controversial from the start, as there was backlash around the choice to begin by killing off Big.\nThe show was also blasted over characters such as Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez), who viewers slammed as a \u201cwoke\u201d caricature.\nDespite all the controversies, \u201cAnd Just Like That\u201d was reportedly not canceled.\nOn Aug. 1, when Parker made the abrupt announcement that the show would end with Season 3, showrunner Michael Patrick King also posted his own announcement on social media.\n\u201cWhile I was writing the last episode of \u2018And Just Like That\u2026\u2019 season 3, it became clear to me that this might be a wonderful place to stop,\u201d he wrote. He claimed that they didn\u2019t announce Season 3 would be the final season ahead of time because \u201cwe didn\u2019t want the word \u2018final\u2019 to overshadow the fun of watching the season.\u201d\nSo, apparently, showing s\u2013t in a toilet on-screen was \u201ca wonderful place to stop.\u201d\nFor a show that began as a fun examination of female empowerment and friendship to end on such a depressing note feels like a slap in the face.\nCarrie\u2019s final line rings of false bravado, trying to put the best face on her loneliness. It started as a comedy. It ended as a tragedy."

      "text": "Delusional Jussie Smollett remains as shameless as ever as he points the finger of blame at everyone else\nDon\u2019t call it a comeback. Call it another shameless and truth-challenged stab at relevancy.\nHate-crime hoaxer extraordinaire Jussie Smollett wants to return to show biz.\nAnd with the unmitigated gall of O.J. Simpson claiming he\u2019s still looking for the real killer, the disgraced \u201cEmpire\u201d actor wants everyone to know who the real bad guys are.\n\u201cThe villains are the two people who assaulted me, the Chicago Police Department and, if I may be so brave, the mayor [Rahm Emanuel],\u201d Smollet told Variety in a fluff piece meant to smooth the road for his imminent reboot.\nYes, the perpetual victim is sticking to his infamous story about a 2019 \u201cbeatdown\u201d \u2014 and channeling the great modern philosopher Shaggy, who once said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d\nSmollett has a new R&B album to promote and will be competing on Fox\u2019s reality show, \u201cSpecial Forces: World\u2019s Toughest Test\u201d Plus, he was interviewed for the documentary \u201cThe Truth about Jussie Smollett?\u201d premiering August 22 on Netflix.\nBut it matters not which projects he has in the pipeline or in his past. The greatest performance of the actor\u2019s life will always be playing the role of an innocent and wronged man.\nAccording to Smollett, he was assaulted for his skin color and sexuality \u2014 and tossed to the wolves by a corrupt mayor and law enforcement attempting to shift attention from their botched handling of a police-involved fatal shooting in 2014.\nIt\u2019s simply too rich for words. But shame has never been his strong suit.\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in a world where the higher-ups, their main mission, in order to do all of the underhanded things that they\u2019re doing, is to distract us with the shiny object,\u201d Smollett told Variety.\nI would say he\u2019s living in a bubble of delusion if he thinks anyone is buying the baloney he\u2019s peddling.\nSmollett\u2019s concocted MAGA fantasy was truly something. He claimed to have left his Chicago apartment at 2 a.m. \u2014 during a polar vortex \u2014 to grab a delicacy from Jared Fogle\u2019s preferred sandwich shop.\nSuddenly, Smollett alleged, a masked man screamed, \u201cEmpire!\u201d followed by a gay slur, another \u201cEmpire\u201d and then an anti-black slur.\nThe attacker screamed \u201cThis is MAGA country\u201d and punched him in the face. Then a second man joined, and the pair worked him like a tag team on \u201cMonday Night Raw.\u201d Only after they left did Smollett realize they had placed a noose around his neck and doused him in bleach.\nThe tale was so insane, he should be banned from ever touching a script with his own pen.\nStill, sympathy poured in from boldface believers. After all, it was 2019, a time when the truth mattered less than the perception of victimhood.\nOn Twitter, then-Sen. Kamala Harris called it \u201can attempted modern day lynching.\u201d Robin Roberts landed an exclusive interview with Smollett on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d where he cried and shook his fists at the doubters. If only his attackers were \u201cMuslim or Mexican or someone black,\u201d he would have more support, dammit.\nHe declared himself the \u201cgay Tupac.\u201d\nMost sensible people smelled a rat.\nThen a pair of Nigerian-American siblings, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo \u2014 who had been extras on \u201cEmpire\u201d \u2014 were busted. During questioning, the brothers Osundairo said Smollett had planned and paid for the beatdown. They even claimed there had been a dress rehearsal.\nSmollett was arrested for filing a false police report. Charges were initially dropped in exchange for community service and bond forfeiture. The city of Chicago sued him for reimbursement of the money wasted investigating his hoax \u2014 and he had the stones to sue right back, claiming he was the victim of \u201cmass public ridicule and harm.\u201d\nHe was indicted again, found guilty, and his conviction was upheld on appeal. In 2024, the verdict was tossed on a technicality.\nHe was not exonerated.\nBack in May, he soft-launched his return on instagram, writing, \u201cThis false narrative has left a stain on my character that will not soon disappear.\u201d\nSubtract the word \u201cfalse\u201d and this is the most honest statement the man has ever made.\nHe\u2019s a spotlight-craving fabulist who exploited racial tensions to increase his fame and, apparently, his \u201cEmpire\u201d paycheck\u2014 with no regard for the tax-payer resources he wasted. Or the public trust he broke.\nIn a 2019 bit about the hoax, comedian Dave Chappelle repeatedly called him \u201cJuicy Smollye\u201d the \u201cfamous French actor,\u201d while \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d put out a hilarious Lifetime movie-style spoof. In 2023, Fox News released a documentary where the Osundairo brothers recreated the choreographed fight at the scene of the crime, leaving no doubt that they were far more entertaining than Smollett.\nBut America is a forgiving place. Just ask Al Sharpton, who weathered the fallout from a disgusting race and rape hoax in the 1980s \u2014 and is now treated as a respectable commentator on MSNBC.\nWhat a great country. Not that Smollett will ever admit that fact. Or the real truth about what happened that freezing night in 2019."

This will be the \u201cSex and the City\u201d reboot\u2019s last season.\nIn a letter posted to social media, creator Michael Patrick King wrote of its demise. \u201cSarah Jessica Parker and I held off announcing the news until now because we didn\u2019t want the word \u2018final\u2019 to overshadow the fun of watching the season.\u201d\nHowever, there was no fun in watching \u201cAnd Just Like That\u2026\u201d Only frustration they made it in the first place.\nIn episode seven of the just-aired third season, Anthony Marentino, played by Mario Cantone grumbles, \u201cJust when you thought it couldn\u2019t get worse.\u201d He was talking about a karaoke performance, but it felt like a metaphor for the whole thing.\nEvery week the bar fell lower and lower, and it became obvious HBO killed the golden goose.\nThey turned an enduring cultural phenomenon \u2014 what started in the late 90s as a sharp and witty aspirational series about four stylish friends unapologetically sowing their oats in an ever-changing New York City \u2014 into a woke joke.\nThe entire endeavor felt like reparations for progressive whinge Cynthia Nixon, who has never stopped complaining about the lack of diversity in the original series.\n\u201cAnd Just like That\u2026\u201d debuted in 2021, in the midst of the great awokening. They killed rich guy Mr. Big, added a few racial minorities, two insufferable nonbinary characters (Che and Charlotte\u2019s daughter Rock) and mirroring reality, turned Nixon\u2019s Miranda Hobbes into a lesbian.\nIt went from appointment television to checklist TV. Critics hated it.\nThis season was less invested in the identity aspect, which made their paint by numbers approach all the more glaring. There was no substance underneath the hood.\nIn season 3, Parker\u2019s Carrie Bradshaw takes a stab at historical fiction. She meets her biographer neighbor who is meant to be a Ron Chernow-like figure.\nThey swap manuscripts, and he marvels over her prose like she\u2019s Jane Austen. It\u2019s silly. An overbearing Charlotte York deals with her husband\u2019s cancer diagnosis, real estate maven Seema Patel has to give up her chauffeured car after getting shafted by Ryan Serhant, while filmmaker Lisa Rodd Wexley flirts with a coworker.\nMiranda sleeps with a closeted nun played by Rosie O\u2019Donnell and is once again gratuitously naked \u2014 an unsightly throughline.\nIn other words, it should have come with a trigger warning.\nThen there was the fashion. In the original series stylist Patricia Field expertly molded four archetypes, setting real life trends and turning luxury labels like Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo into household names while Carrie\u2019s Fendi Baguette became an \u201cIt\u201d bag.\nCarrie was eclectic and cool, the others chic and polished.\nThis latest version, the women aren\u2019t wearing clothing as much as they are ridiculous costumes. In one scene, Carrie struts around Central Park in a giant Holly Hobbie hat and matching prairie dress. Ditto for Lisa and Charlotte, who always look like Bergdorf mannequins \u2014 even at school drop off.\nIt\u2019s like the athleisure revolution never happened.\nNo one in New York dresses like this.\nThe original sold a Cosmo-soaked version of New York City where friendships were unbreakable, sex was plenty and the air was optimistic.\nBut in their 50s, they all seem to be struggling more than ever. And yes, pathetic.\nA younger colleague told me this chapter made her sad and was more of a cautionary tale for 20 somethings.\nIt took the air out of the fantasy \u2014 and ruined the sex."

      "text": "Howard Stern\u2019s show may be ending. Now\u2019s the time to put it out of its misery\nJust pull the plug already.\nIt\u2019s time. In fact, it\u2019s past time. The body is barely breathing.\nYes, \u201cThe Howard Stern Show\u201d on SiriusXM is reportedly limping toward its final destination. The former shock jock\u2019s $500 million contract, which he signed in 2020, is up in the fall; according to the US Sun, there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019ll be offered less money than he wants to renew.\nWhile there\u2019s no official confirmation the show will end, it should go the way of Stephen Colbert\u2019s farce of a late-night show.\nThis isn\u2019t dancing on the grave of someone\u2019s career. It\u2019s merely acknowledging reality: Stern, 71, was paid all that \u2018scarole to be edgy, relevant and interesting \u2014 something he hasn\u2019t been in years.\nCertainly not since he enlisted in the cult of woo-woo therapization and disavowed so much of his best work, including pulling bawdy confessions from image-conscious boldfacers.\nNo more jokes about masturbating to Aunt Jemima. No more feuds with celebs like Chevy Chase and Kathie Lee Gifford. No more release-valve humor during some of our country\u2019s darkest events. Or the inclination to be raw and unfiltered.\nOnce a swashbuckling, norms-shattering FCC antagonist, Stern has morphed into everything he formerly railed against.\nWhen it comes to celebrities, he can\u2019t fawn over them enough now. Stern\u2019s a first-class, A-list \u201cAss Smoochio,\u201d a nickname he gave Arsenio Hall back in the day.\nLast summer, Stern \u2014 overestimating his own influence \u2014 made things even worse by entering the presidential media circus to sit down with a clearly diminished Joe Biden.\nThe old Stern would have spent 30 minutes at least on the gaffe-prone president\u2019s mythical neighborhood gang leader and overall \u201cbad dude\u201d Corn Pop.\nInstead, he marveled over Scranton Joe\u2019s high school football exploits. He called Biden\u2019s family \u2014 which consists of a crackhead son he later pardoned and a grandchild he didn\u2019t acknowledge until the New York Times bullied him into it \u2014 \u201cextraordinary.\u201d\nStern even offered this profundity: \u201cYou\u2019re the kind of leader I love \u2026 we\u2019re lucky to have you in the Oval Office.\u201d\nFartman would never.\nNot only did the fawning interview make Biden look like a doddering old man, it made Stern look positively impotent.\nStern sank even lower when he interviewed Biden\u2019s replacement, Kamala Harris.\n\u201cWhen I met you out in the hall, I said, \u2018I\u2019m really nervous because I want this to go well for you,\u2019\u201d Stern said. He then whined about \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d parodying Harris.\n\u201cI hate it. I don\u2019t want you being made fun of,\u201d Stern told her. \u201cThere\u2019s too much at stake. I believe the entire future of this country right now \u2026 it\u2019s literally on the line.\u201d\nImagine that. A man who built an empire off of mocking powerful people thought that the potential president of the United States shouldn\u2019t have to suffer a few jokes at her expense \u2014 something that actually works to humanize a candidate.\nTo call it malpractice would be kind.\nMeanwhile, Stern\u2019s loyal audience, who dutifully renewed their Sirius subscriptions, are fair game for his wrath.\nLocking himself away in a two-year COVID quarantine, he derided listeners for daring to go outside and live their lives, calling them \u201cstupid\u201d for not sharing his ideology.\n\u201cI hate the people who vote for [former President Donald Trump],\u201d he said last September. \u201cI think they\u2019re stupid. I do. I\u2019ll be honest with you, I have no respect for you.\u201d\nSiriusXM essentially built its initial subscriber base on the back of the one-time \u201cKing of All Media,\u201d who in 2006 left terrestrial radio and the constraints of the FCC. That deal was reportedly worth $100 million a year and made him a very wealthy man.\nNearly 20 years later, the once-mighty monarch looks like a minor jester.\nMeanwhile, the media and entertainment landscape has been radically reshaped by an overabundance of podcasts. There are a gazillion hosts doing what Stern once did \u2014 and many doing it much better.\nIt\u2019s time for the retirement tour."

      "text": "\u2018And Just Like That\u2019 ripped for poop scene in franchise-ending finale: \u2018I feel insulted\u2019\nI couldn\u2019t help but wonder, why did Carrie Bradshaw\u2019s story have such a crappy ending?\nThe \u201cSex and the City\u201d spinoff, \u201cAnd Just Like That,\u201d had its series finale on Thursday after three seasons on HBO Max \u2013 marking the end of Carrie Bradshaw\u2019s (Sarah Jessica Parker) story, which started in 1998.\nThe end of her story wasn\u2019t sexy or romantic, or even full of profound friendship moments. Instead, the final episode had a scene involving\u2026.poop. Really.\nFans blasted the show for the ending scene.\n\u201cWhy am I saying farewell to some of my favorite TV characters of all time and seeing a toilet overflow on my screen?\u201d one enraged fan posted on X, formerly Twitter.\nAnother proclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s a choice to make the series finale have 3 scenes involving sh*t and piss\u2026 the writers def hate us.\u201d\nA third fan wrote, \u201cWhy have I seen 2 men pee this episode and now a sea of turds.\u201d\nA third viewer said, \u201cthe series finale of And Just Like That genuinely made me run to the bathroom and vomit and i think that\u2019s such a testament to its legacy.\u201d\nAnother fan slammed the ending, saying, \u201cI believe the writers were like f\u2013k ya\u2019ll for sh-tting on us..having the last 8 minutes of shots of Victor Garber pissing and seeing literal sh-ts in an overflowing toilet. Not to be dramatic but feel insulted as a long time viewer. the world is bad enough.\u201d\nDuring the series finale, Carrie attends a dinner party for Thanksgiving.\nHer friends Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and Charlotte (Kristin Davis), aren\u2019t there for most of it, as Miranda had to go support her girlfriend with a dog emergency at the vet, and Charlotte had to support her husband, who had recovered from his erectile dysfunction issues after his cancer.\nThis leaves Carrie alone with Miranda\u2019s son, Brady (Niall Cunningham), three of Brady\u2019s irritating friends, and Mark (Victor Garber), who Charlotte invited to set up with Carrie (much to Carrie\u2019s dismay, since she wasn\u2019t interested in him).\nOne of Brady\u2019s friends clogs the toilet and tells everyone that they need to light a candle after she uses the bathroom.\nLater, when Mark uses the toilet, it overflows, and the camera shows crap in it.\nSo, when people say that the show had a sh-tty finale, they\u2019re speaking literally.\nA gross-out toilet scene is an undignified way to end the story of an iconic TV character, especially on a show known for being sexy and fun, in its heyday.\n\u201cSex and the City\u201d first premiered in 1998 following Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha (Kim Cattrall, who only had a brief cameo in \u201cAnd Just Like That\u201d) through sex and dating adventures in New York City.\nFollowing that show\u2019s 2004 finale, they returned for movies in 2008 and 2010, before \u201cAnd Just Like That\u201d premiered in 2021 to follow the friends in their 50s \u2013 without Samantha.\n\u201cAnd Just Like That\u201d has been unpopular among fans from the beginning.\nAfter it premiered by killing off Carrie\u2019s longtime love, Big (Chris Noth), enraged fans said that the show \u201cruined\u201d the original series, and \u201cdestroyed\u201d Big and Carrie.\nCritics also blasted \u201cAnd Just Like That\u201d for making some characters \u201cwoke\u201d caricatures, like Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez), who was in Seasons 1 and 2.\nDespite its dwindling ratings and controversies, \u201cAnd Just Like That\u201d was reportedly not canceled.\nOn August 1, when Parker made the abrupt announcement that the show would end with Season 3, showrunner Michael Patrick King also posted his own announcement on social media.\n\u201cWhile I was writing the last episode of \u2018And Just Like That\u2026\u2019 season 3, it became clear to me that this might be a wonderful place to stop,\u201d he wrote.\nHe claimed that they didn\u2019t announce that Season 3 would be the final season ahead of time, because, \u201cwe didn\u2019t want the word \u2018final\u2019 to overshadow the fun of watching the season.\u201d\nThe toilet scene caused fans to doubt his words.\n\u201cThey made the whole show about Aiden, just for him to leave, they retconned Big, they lost Samantha, and they made the 33-minute finale emotionless and sh-t-filled,\u201d one fan said.\n\u201cThis cannot have been a \u2018planned\u2019 And Just Like That Finale?! I\u2019m a die-hard SATC fan, but, wow.\u201d"

      "text": "AI version of Parkland massacre victim isn\u2019t the answer to any of our problems\nOn Monday night, former CNN blowhard Jim Acosta interviewed a slain victim of the 2018 Parkland, Florida, massacre.\nYou read that correctly.\nAcosta, who now has his own Substack and accompanying YouTube channel, spoke with an artificial intelligence avatar of Joaquin Oliver \u2014 one of 17 victims senselessly gunned down by a deranged former classmate at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\nJoaquin was only 17 when he died. Monday would have been his 25th birthday, surely a difficult day for his loved ones and a moment to lament his stolen future.\n\u201cRemembering Joaquin: AI Brings Voice to Gun Victims\u201d was the title of the episode. A rather strange summation from Acosta, who has made himself into a warrior against so-called disinformation.\nIn reality, it was more of a bizarre AI demonstration than an interview.\nAcosta asked the computer-generated stand-in about his own \u201csolution for gun violence.\u201d\n\u201cGreat question,\u201d said the avatar. \u201cI believe in a mix of stronger gun control laws, mental health support and community engagement. We need to create safe spaces for conversations and connections, making sure everyone feels seen and heard. It\u2019s about building a culture of kindness and understanding. What do you think about that?\u201d\nDespite the likeness sounding robotic, Acosta acted like he was having a thoughtful human interaction. He went on to ask \u201cJoaquin\u201d about his favorite movies and sports.\n\u201c \u2018Star Wars\u2019 is such an epic saga. The adventures, the characters and that iconic music are unforgettable,\u201d the avatar responded, adding that he also likes the Miami Heat and LeBron James.\n\u201cJoaquin\u201d ended each answer by tossing an automated-sounding question back to Acosta \u2014 bringing to mind the computer in the 1983 Matthew Broderick movie \u201cWar Games.\u201d\nAnd yet Acosta continued with the unsettling charade. He noted that we\u2019ve heard politicians\u2019 takes on the shooting, but \u201cnow we\u2019re hearing from one of the kids. That\u2019s important.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also false. And grotesque. Like a dystopian plot come to life.\nWe were hearing not from a victim but an uncanny-valley likeness uploaded with activist talking points and, according to his father, Manny Oliver, some of Joaquin\u2019s own writings and social media posts.\nAcosta was rightly and roundly criticized for \u201cinterviewing\u201d an AI avatar.\nIn response to the backlash, the victim\u2019s father said, \u201cIf the problem you have is with the AI, then you have the wrong problem. The real problem is my son was shot.\u201d\nNo one is arguing that last part. The massacre in Parkland was the result of many systemic failures, and a bloody stain on our history. I understand that the Oliver family\u2019s grief must be so immense that they\u2019ll do anything to keep their son\u2019s legacy alive.\nHowever, it\u2019s not about how Joaquin died, but the decision to resurrect their son as an activist with Acosta aiding and abetting this dangerous delusion. The whole endeavor raises ethical questions and further muddies our already twisted reality.\nAre we really hurtling toward transhumanism this quickly? Do the dead have any say in how they are used after they leave this Earth?\nJoaquin\u2019s father emphasized that he understood this is indeed AI and that he cannot bring back his son. But, he said, hearing his child\u2019s voice brings comfort to him and his wife.\nNo one should deny them that private pursuit of comfort.\nBut he is also hoping his son\u2019s AI becomes an influencer. In 2024, Manny Oliver and his gun-control group, Change The Ref, also used his son\u2019s voice to send a message to members of Congress, urging them to vote for more gun-control measures.\n\u201cNow Joaquin is gonna start having followers . . . He\u2019s going to start uploading videos. This is just the beginning,\u201d said Manny, adding that \u201cmoving forward, we will have Joaquin on stage in the middle of a debate. And knowledge is solid. His knowledge is unlimited.\u201d\nBut can a computer really know the thoughts and soul of a human being?\nUsing AI as a vessel isn\u2019t going to save the world or stop gun violence. From what I\u2019ve seen thus far, it will just add more well-meaning but ultimately nonsubstantive sentiments to this contentious subject.\nLet\u2019s not be like Acosta and pretend otherwise."
