  "title": "I\u2019m always looking for new movies and shows \u2013 these are the 5 apps I rely on to make streaming simple",
  "description": "There's plenty of tech to help curate the perfect viewing",
  "content": "With an ever increasing list of content providers to choose from, it can be increasingly difficult to find what to watch, and on which of the best streaming services or best free streaming services you can watch it, especially with so many shows and movies jumping between the various platforms. But that\u2019s where we come in.\n\nAlongside the boom in on-demand streamers, a number of apps and websites have popped up designed to help you find the type of movies and shows you love, based on recommendations from folks with similar tastes and interests. The following list contains everything from social sites to search tools and one of the mainstream internet's oldest ports of call. Do note though, that while all of the following are free to download and use, some may require a subscription for certain features.\n\nSo, if you\u2019ve ever found yourself overwhelmed in a sea of content, knowing there\u2019s stuff you\u2019d love but with no idea how or where to find it, read on, as we outline our five favorite apps designed to help you navigate the streaming landscape.\n\nJustWatch is an app designed to help you find exactly where you can stream the movie or show you\u2019re in the mood for.\n\nIts encyclopedic knowledge of global streaming homes means you can simply search the title you\u2019re looking for and it\u2019ll tell you which service is currently hosting it, as well as options for digital rental and purchase. You can also change the region you\u2019re searching in, which is handy if you find yourself overseas as streaming service\u2019s libraries vary between countries.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for recommendations, JustWatch is also a great place to start, with tabs letting you know what\u2019s just been released across the major streamers, as well as what\u2019s popular. There\u2019s also quirky features like TV show tracking, allowing you to be notified when a new season drops, and lists made by users which may provide viewing inspiration.\n\nWhile some could argue the additional features are starting to overwhelm the basic search tool that made JustWatch so essential to begin with, it still remains the must have streaming companion.\n\nOnce considered a film snob's paradise, Letterboxd usership exploded during the pandemic, with the social media platform now used by over 17 million film fans.\n\nEssentially a cataloging service, the app allows users to log and rate each film they see, write and share reviews and connect with other cinephiles. Users can also compile lists and rank franchise films in order, sparking discussion and creating a resource for other members.\n\nAs with most of the platforms outlined here, Letterboxd also allows users to browse based on what they\u2019re into, or just generally look at the week\u2019s biggest releases, offering data on how many times a film has been \u2018liked,\u2019 watched and added to a list.\n\nBe warned though, while Letterboxd is a great way to log one's own cinematic experience and connect with others, there\u2019s a tendency for some to leave deliberately \u2018funny\u2019 reviews, which tend to creep up the algorithms and bury some of the more useful ones.\n\nThat being said, Letterboxd is still a great place to be if you're a movie fan, to look back on what you\u2019ve seen and find great new movies you may have otherwise missed.\n\nA movie site that\u2019s been around since the dark ages of the internet, this writer remembers browsing the platform back when you couldn\u2019t surf the web if someone wanted to make a phone call at the same time.\n\nAt its core, an enormous database that lists every film ever made, every actor who ever spoke and every crew member that ever did a Starbucks run, IMDb is one of the most popular websites in the world.\n\nStarting life as a fan-run database, the site has been owned by Amazon since before most of us had home computers, with the retail giant even branding their free streaming tier IMDb TV at one point. But other than the obvious advertising and the absence of information regarding any streaming home that isn\u2019t Prime Video, IMDb runs fairly independently.\n\nUsers can search anything from films to actors, directors, writers and more and get comprehensive information on all. There\u2019s also recommendation lists, cinema listings, interview videos, news, trailers and just about anything a film and TV fan could wish for.\n\nYou\u2019ll likely be familiar with the database giant, but if not, it\u2019s an essential partner for any media fan.\n\nTrakt works similarly to some of the features already listed in that it's a platform predominantly designed to help you track everything you watch.\n\nThe big advantage with Trakt, however, is that it is able to sync with some of the most popular media centres to log everything you\u2019re watching in real-time without the need for the user to manually input the data.\n\nThere\u2019s also familiar features such as lists of the hottest shows and movies and where they\u2019re available, and it\u2019ll also remind you when new episodes of previously watched shows are due to air. Like Letterboxd, the app also has a social element, with those signed up able to rate and review movies and shows and discuss them with the wider community.\n\nOne of Trakt\u2019s best features, however, is that because it logs everything your watching, it gets a good flavor of what you enjoy, and then uses that data to recommend new entertainment, which is a great way to discover more niche stuff you may have otherwise missed.\n\nNot as essential as some of the above, perhaps, but if you're the sort of viewer who likes to keep your viewing habits in order, Trakt is a fantastic piece of tech.\n\nWhile predominantly geared towards readers, Fable recently introduced TV to its social community.\n\nFable is an app designed to allow users to track, discover and discuss books and TV shows with users from across the globe and engage with suggestions from tastemakers and experts.\n\nThe list section contains carefully curated choices based around mood and interests designed to help users spend less time searching, while their book and watch clubs allow members to discuss whatever they\u2019re currently watching (or reading) with a community of like-minded people.\n\nYou can also track what you\u2019re reading and watching, your progress, your favourite moments and make public and private lists to help you return to your most loved shows and books, often with a discussion-induced refreshed perspective.\n\nBook lovers will definitely get the most out of the platform, but for TV fans looking to enjoy their favourite shows with an inclusive community, Fable is becoming the place to be.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 6 best streaming apps on Android: our picks for TV, anime, film, and more\n\u2022 This app is like Letterboxd for TV shows \u2013 and it's sorted my streaming plans\n\u2022 Watch Netflix on your phone? It just got easier to find new shows and movies",

      "text": "This app is like Letterboxd for TV shows \u2013 and it's sorted my streaming plans for 2025\nMarathon is a genuinely useful TV companion\nThis is part of a regular series of articles exploring the apps that we couldn't live without. Read them all here.\nWith the arrival of digital media and streaming, we've now all got access to more movies, television shows, and music than we could ever hope to get through in one lifetime \u2013 and it's now quite a challenge keeping track of everything that's been watched and listened to, and what's worth queueing up next.\nWhen it comes to TV show tracking, I've been relying on Marathon, which is available for Android and iOS as well as the web. It manages to check off everything you want from an app like this: it's simple to get started, easy to find your way around the user interface, and it has a comprehensive and up-to-date database.\nYou can get started with the app for free, and there's a paid tier for $1.99 / \u00a31.99 / AU$2.99 a month that gives you access to extra customization features for your profile and support for tags to organize lists and reviews. Your money will also support future development of the app as well of course.\nGetting started with the Marathon app\nThe onboarding process is the same as it is with most apps of this ilk: you need to share a bit about what you're interested in so that the app and its recommendations can be customized to suit you. Right at the start, Marathon asked me about the streaming and TV services I'm signed up for, and some of the shows I've already watched.\nWith that done, it's time to record your watching in the app, and Marathon somehow manages to make the process fun. You're able to tap through a series of checkboxes to log individual episodes, and the app has some nice, smooth animations to go with this. My recent viewing always stays at the top, and I can always see how far through each of my various shows I am.\nMarathon works really well as a way of keeping track of your upcoming viewing as well as what you've seen in the past. You can see what episode you're up to in each series \u2013 very handy for those that stretch across multiple seasons and multiple years \u2013 and you can even mark shows as paused or abandoned. It's another sign that the developers have thought of everything.\nVia the profile tab you can add a few details for other Marathon members to see (you can follow other users you're interested in, just like social media). There are spots for your favorite shows, the ratings and reviews you've left, and any lists you've made. You can also see some stats about how much watching you've logged on Marathon.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nFinding, logging, and reviewing shows\nPerhaps the most obvious place to start when you're actually in the Marathon app proper is the search box up at the top. Once I've found a show I'm watching, I get a nicely-presented listing page for it: there are details of what the show's about, when it first aired, who's in the cast, and plenty more. You can even dig into individual episodes.\nThe app lets you leave reviews and ratings for individual episodes as well as whole shows, and you can see which platforms each show is streaming on too. Tap on Watch, and you get a show added to your list \u2013 you can then start logging your watching from the watchlist tab in the app, as described above.\nThe app covers a lot of ground, and yet it never feels overly cluttered or too busy. One of the biggest challenges for apps of this type are stuffing the maximum number of features and the maximum amount of information in without everything getting out of hand \u2013 and that's a challenge Marathon meets very well.\nI like the way you can add a whole host of television to the app and it doesn't really break sweat. Tools like the filters and sorting options on your watchlist mean you never get lost inside the app, and everything is well laid out across the various tabs. It's the sort of app you can just dive in and start using without any hand-holding.\nTracking future watching in the Marathon app\nAnother area where Marathon really excels is in the way it handles everything that hasn't yet aired: if I go to the watchlist page I can see when future episodes are dropping and when new seasons are premiering. Several times now the app has given me a heads-up about new episodes and seasons that I wouldn't have otherwise found out about until after they'd been out for days or weeks.\nI also make a lot of use of the explore tab inside the app. It couldn't be any simpler to tap through on lists of shows proving popular with other users, new shows coming to specific streaming services, shows sorted by genre, and even curated lists based around themes (such as workplace comedies).\nThere's not a huge amount here in the way of customizations, but you do get the choice of a light or dark mode for the interface, and it is possible to tweak some of the ways gestures work and which tabs in the app open first. Profile extras such as custom show posters come with an account upgrade.\nOne of the ways I can tell I like Marathon is that I'll often dive into it even when I'm not logging what I'm watching \u2013 just to have a browse around, and to leave some reviews.\nIt's a slick and intuitive second screen companion for my television watching, and I'm hoping it'll continue to get better over time, too.\nYou might also like\nDave is a freelance tech journalist who has been writing about gadgets, apps and the web for more than two decades.

      "text": "Watch Netflix on your phone? It just got easier to find the shows and movies you love\nThe new My Netflix feature is available on iOS now and coming to Android in August\nNetflix just made it a whole lot easier to find shows and movies worth watching \u2013 provided you're on your phone. The Netflix mobile app is getting a new feature, My Netflix, and it's available in the iOS app now.\nIt'll be coming to Android in the next couple of weeks, and while Netflix hasn't indicated that it's coming to other platforms such as the best TVs, it'll no doubt appear on those eventually too.\nMy Netflix is a replacement for the Downloads tab. Your downloads will still be there, but the new tab also brings more personalized content to help you share what you've watched and to find more of the best Netflix series and best Netflix movies.\nWhat is My Netflix and why is it there?\nWriting on the official Netflix blog, Edith Chao explains that My Netflix is \"a one-stop shop tailored to you with easy shortcuts to help you choose what you want to watch\".\nShe continues: \"In this new dedicated space on iOS and Android globally, you can see your downloads (e.g. Quarterback episodes for that long flight), TV series and movies you gave a thumbs up to, shows and films you\u2019ve saved to My List (e.g. Heart of Stone, anyone?), trailers you\u2019ve watched, reminders you\u2019ve set, whatever you\u2019re in the middle of watching, what you\u2019ve recently watched, and more.\"\nThe idea is that the more you interact with the best streaming service, the more personal the My Netflix tab will become. So, in addition to reminders of forthcoming shows and links to shows that you've watched trailers for, it'll also start recommending more things to stream based on the shows you've watched, liked and shared with others.\nThe new feature is available in the iOS app today and Netflix promises that it'll be in the Android version in early August 2023.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContributor\nWriter, broadcaster, musician and kitchen gadget obsessive Carrie Marshall has been writing about tech since 1998, contributing sage advice and odd opinions to all kinds of magazines and websites as well as writing more than twenty books. Her latest, a love letter to music titled Small Town Joy, is on sale now. She is the singer in spectacularly obscure Glaswegian rock band Unquiet Mind."

      "text": "Best free streaming service in 2025: Tubi, Pluto TV, The Roku Channel and more\nThe best free streaming services\nThis is your TechRadar guide to the best free streaming services. We\u2019re all familiar with the best streaming services like Disney Plus, Netflix and Prime Video. But in recent years, free ad-supported streaming TV (known as FAST) services have emerged as a popular alternative. These platforms provide access to vast libraries of TV shows and movies without requiring you to pay for a subscription.\nMost FAST services are funded by ads, which allows you to watch a wide range of content \u2013 and sometimes even live TV channels \u2013 completely free of charge. This makes them an excellent choice if you're on a budget and new to streaming or if you're looking to add to your existing subscriptions with more options \u2013 but at no extra cost. Despite being free, most of these services offer thousands of titles, including classic films, popular TV shows, kids\u2019 programming, sports, and much more.\nIn the guide below, you\u2019ll find our top picks of the best free services available today. Whether you\u2019re searching for specific content, like independent movies or live TV, or you need a service that integrates seamlessly with your devices, we\u2019ll help you choose the right FAST service for you. We\u2019ll also explore the differences between services owned by media companies, device manufacturers and independent platforms, providing everything you need to make the right choice.\nThe best free streaming service for most people\n1. Tubi\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReasons to watch\n\u2705 You enjoy having a lot of choice: The focus is more on older content, but there's still plenty to choose from with more than 250,000 movies and TV episodes in the US (its UK library consists of 20,000 and in Australia, it has 7,000 titles) .\n\u2705 You like to watch on different devices: Several services in this guide offer good compatibility, but Tubi is one of the best. If you like to move between a smartphone, web browser, TV or even a games console, you're sorted.\n\u2705 You still want the option of live TV: With more than 250 live TV channels on offer in the US, it's a great option for those who don't like the idea of ditching traditional TV for good in favor of streamers \u2013 although what you get does depend on your location.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You're not nostalgic for older content: Tubi makes a thing out of the fact it offers a lot of older movies and classic TV shows \u2013 and there are some gems here, but if you prefer the freshest content, you might get fed up with what's on offer quickly.\n\u274c You like quality, higher res movies: Tubi streams its content in 720p. While this is considered HD, it might seem low, especially if you compare it to top streaming services like Netflix, which offers 1080p (Full HD) and 4K (Ultra HD) too.\n\u274c You don't like unpredictability: Most of the FAST services here, by definition, rely on ads. We've made peace with that. But with Tubi you might not always be able to predict when they'll pop up, which some viewers may find doubly frustrating.\nIs Tubi worth watching?\nTubi, launched in 2014, is a leader in the Free Ad-Supported Streaming TV (FAST) service space and is already more popular than Max, Peacock and Paramount Plus. It\u2019s owned by Fox Corporation and is a top pick for many users, offering a free and ad-supported platform with a vast library of more than 250,000 movies and TV episodes in the US, 20,000 in the UK and 7,000 in Australia. Although Tubi doesn\u2019t specify if this number includes individual episodes, the sheer volume of content is impressive.\nOne of Tubi\u2019s standout features is how easy it is to use. You can start watching without the need for a subscription, account creation, or even providing personal information. However, if you do sign up, you get access to useful features like parental controls, personalized watchlists, and tracking your viewing history.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nTubi\u2019s content library is diverse, spanning Hollywood classics, mainstream favorites, and niche genres, like cult sci-fi, horror, international cinema, and K-dramas. The platform includes films from major distributors, including Disney, Lionsgate, NBCUniversal, and Sony Pictures Entertainment. Although much of the content leans toward older titles, it\u2019s a treasure trove if you enjoy revisiting films from the past few decades.\nWhile Tubi doesn\u2019t specify how frequently its library is updated, new titles appear regularly enough to keep the selection fresh during my few weeks of testing \u2013 here are five free movies on Tubi UK with over 89% on Rotten Tomatoes to get an idea of what I found. There are more options in the US, though \u2013 with three of our favorite thrillers of all time free to watch on Tubi.\nBeyond on-demand content, Tubi also offers over 250 live TV channels in the US, featuring news, sports, and entertainment. Although these channels are only available exclusively to the US. The service is accessible on a wide range of devices, including iOS and Android phones, tablets, computers, the best streaming devices like Roku, Apple TV or Amazon Fire TV, gaming consoles like Xbox and PlayStation, and most smart TVs, including the best TVs available. However, it\u2019s important to note that Tubi doesn\u2019t support offline downloads, so you\u2019ll need to stay connected to stream content.\nTubi\u2019s user interface is straightforward and user-friendly, reminding me of a simplified version of Netflix. While the search functionality is fine, the platform could benefit from additional filtering options, like sorting by ratings or popularity. Tubi says a recommendation engine is in place to suggest content, though it may not be as sophisticated as those on paid services.\nAdvertisements are integrated into the viewing experience. Tubi says breaks average around two minutes every 15 minutes, which is similar to traditional cable TV. Ads are part and parcel of FAST services and don\u2019t feel overly intrusive when you\u2019re expecting them, but I did see some reviewers say they could have been placed at lulls in drama. For UK viewers, an alternative to consider is Freely. This is a new all-in-one TV service from BBC, ITV, and Channel 4 that offers a similar experience to Tubi but with a focus on British public service broadcasters.\nThe best free streaming service for live TV\n2. Pluto TV\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReasons to watch\n\u2705 A lot of content to choose from: More than 250 TV channels in the US (150 in the UK and 50 in Australia), and access to a vast library of on-demand movies and TV shows. It covers a range of genres from news and sports to entertainment and kids' programming.\n\u2705 No sign-up required: Simply download the app or visit the website and start streaming immediately, although creating an account does allow for personalized features, like setting your favorite channels.\n\u2705 Familiar, cable-like experience: In terms of what\u2019s on offer, the live TV is content what you know and recognize, and you'll be familiar with how the interface works. This could certainly make cutting the cord on your cable package easier to stomach.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c A lot of ads: This is totally expected from a FAST service. But sometimes we watched 30-minutes of a TV show with four ad breaks, which seems excessive. Then again, that's possibly not that different to watching cable TV.\n\u274c Limited new content: Pluto TV\u2019s library is huge, but it tends to focus on older content and reruns rather than the latest shows or exclusive originals. That said, it does mix up its catalog every month with a new batch of arrivals.\n\u274c No recording, pausing or offline viewing: You can\u2019t record or pause the live TV channels. And there's no option for offline viewing, which might be limiting if you can't always guarantee an internet connection.\nIs Pluto TV worth watching?\nLaunched in 2014 and acquired by Paramount Global in 2019, Pluto TV has become a major player in the FAST service space. Available in the US, UK, and via 10Play in Australia, Pluto TV offers a blend of live TV channels and on-demand video content. The availability of live TV channels varies by location, with options like CBS News, Bloomberg, Fox Sports, and NFL Channel, alongside content from entertainment channels like Comedy Central, MTV, and Nickelodeon.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nThe Pluto TV service has more than 250 channels in the US, 150 in the UK and 50 in Australia, which are not all traditional channels but themed offerings, like Pluto Movies, British Screen Classics, and Pluto Cult Films. This setup replicates the traditional cable TV experience, offering a familiar interface and a wide range of programming across various genres, including news, sports, entertainment, and kids' shows. However, it\u2019s important to note that the live channels do not support pausing or rewinding. On the other hand, the on-demand content, which allows users to pick and watch movies or TV shows at their convenience, can be paused, just like watching one of the best streaming services.\nOne of Pluto TV\u2019s greatest strengths is its accessibility. The service is available on lots of devices, including the best phones, tablets, smart TVs, and gaming consoles. It can also be accessed through web browsers. The user interface is intuitive, designed to resemble a traditional TV guide, making channel surfing easy and familiar \u2013 it doesn\u2019t feel as if it\u2019s a Netflix clone like the rivals in this list. While you don\u2019t need to sign up for an account, doing so allows you to customize your viewing experience to make finding your next favorite TV shows and movies easier, and resume watching where you left off on different devices.\nPluto TV's content library is diverse and does see monthly new additions \u2013 just look at these five movies with over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes new to Paramount's free service Pluto TV for an idea \u2013 but tends to focus on older and classic titles, making it perfect for those who enjoy nostalgic TV shows and movies. However, this does mean the platform doesn\u2019t feature many new releases or original content. The service is ad-supported, with ad breaks occurring roughly three times per 30-minutes of viewing, each lasting a few minutes.\nPluto TV is an excellent choice for anyone seeking a free, easy-to-use streaming service that feels familiar with a wide variety of channels and content. It\u2019s especially well-suited for cord-cutters looking to replace their cable TV service. For those looking for alternatives, US-only services like Sling Freestream (owned by Dish Network) \u2013 not to be confused with its paid-for service Sling TV, which has been known to offer a free trial if you want to try it out \u2013 and Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu) are worth considering.\nThe best free streaming service for movies\n3. Plex\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReasons to watch\n\u2705 Huge library of content: Plex offers more than 50,000 on-demand movies and TV shows worldwide, along with 893 live channels in the US, 297 in the UK and 246 in Australia. There\u2019s a broad spectrum of genres, too, including classic titles and recently-released content.\n\u2705 Personal media integration: The only option in this guide that can also become a personal media server. As well as the content Plex offers, you can stream your own collection of movies, music, and photos from any device connected to your server.\n\u2705 Free to use but with optional premium features: If you want extra features, like offline downloads, Plex offers the Plex Pass for $4.99 per month in the US, \u00a33.99 in the UK and AU$4.99 in Australia \u2013 that doesn't get rid of ads though.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c A lot of ads that sometimes crash the app. Ads are expected with FAST services, but there seem to be a lot on Plex. Other reviewers commented that ads caused the app to crash, a complaint that seems too common for it to be a one-off.\n\u274c Limited movie content: While Plex has a large library, it doesn\u2019t offer much in the way of new releases or original content and many other rivals in this list, especially Tubi, have a better movie selection.\n\u274c Complex setup for advanced features: Getting setup with Plex\u2019s more advanced features, like the personal media server, might be challenging for less tech-savvy users.\nIs Plex worth watching?\nLaunched in 2008, Plex has evolved into an all-in-one streaming platform that stands out in the FAST space by offering more than free movies and TV shows. As an independent service not owned by a media company or device manufacturer, Plex combines a vast library of more than 50,000 on-demand titles globally with the ability to integrate and manage your personal media collection.\nPlex's content library is diverse, featuring partnerships with major studios like Lionsgate, AMC, and A24, which ensures a steady stream of quality content \u2013 here are five movies with over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes on Plex in September to get an idea of what's on offer. The platform also offers over 1,100 live TV channels worldwide, though the availability of these channels can vary by location\u2014users in the US have access to 893 live channels, while those in the UK have 297 and 246 in Australia.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nThe experience here is similar to Pluto\u2019s, offering both live channels and on-demand content, but the design is a little different. The interface is user-friendly, offering a dark, Netflix-like design with tiles representing channels and movie titles. You can easily browse by category or explore curated collections such as 'What's Trending', 'Recently Added', and 'Leaving Soon'.\nWhat sets Plex apart is its functionality as a media server. Users can stream their personal collection of movies, music, and photos from any device, transforming Plex into a one-stop media hub. This feature will be appealing if you have an extensive digital library and want seamless access across all of your devices.\nThere\u2019s also a premium subscription called Plex Pass, priced at $4.99 per month in the US, \u00a33.99 in the UK and AU$4.99 in Australia, if you want more advanced features, like offline downloads and live TV DVR. However, it's important to note that Plex Pass does not remove ads from the free content. On the topic of ads, you\u2019ll find lots here. Some users have reported ads that seem frustratingly frequent.\nPlex is accessible on a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, gaming consoles, and streaming devices, making it easy to enjoy your content anywhere. You don't need to create an account to start watching, but signing up offers benefits, like the ability to resume playback across devices.\nAdditional features like a cross-service watchlist, social networking elements, and Discover Credits (which provides information about your favorite actors and their other roles) add to the Plex experience, making it a comprehensive entertainment hub. However, if you\u2019re looking for a similar service, Sony's Crackle service is a good US-based alternative, especially since many of the free titles on Plex are sourced from Crackle.\nOther free streaming services to consider\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best free streaming service for classic cinema\n4. Kanopy\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReasons to watch\n\u2705 Educational and niche content: Kanopy excels in offering a curated selection of documentaries, education films, foreign films and independent films. Great if you\u2019re interested in learning.\n\u2705 Free access via universities and libraries: Kanopy is available for free through participating public libraries and universities.\n\u2705 No ads: Unlike most other FAST services which, by definition, have ads, Kanopy doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s because you do have to be part of a participating library or uni \u2013 and not all are signed up.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c Limited mainstream content: Kanopy's library is rich in educational and independent films, but it lacks a large selection of mainstream blockbuster movies and popular TV shows.\n\u274c Several alternatives: The range of classic cinema is not as good as the paid-for service the Criterion Collection. For US readers, there's a similar free streaming service called Hoopla that also requires you to have a library card.\n\u274c Limited availability and limited monthly views. Not all libraries and unis are signed up. You\u2019ll have to check. Depending on the plan, there are also some monthly view restrictions. Not ideal if you\u2019re a heavy user.\nIs Kanopy worth watching?\nLaunched in 2008, Kanopy is a unique streaming service that differentiates itself to FAST services by being completely ad-free. This is possible through its partnerships with over 4,000 public libraries and universities worldwide. If your local library or university is part of the network, you can access Kanopy's entire catalogue with a valid library card or university login. However, the big caveat here is that not every library or university is partnered with Kanopy, so you\u2019ll need to check to see if yours is before you sign up to this alternative streaming service.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nKanopy\u2019s focus on educational content, documentaries, foreign films, and independent cinema sets it apart from other streaming services. With the motto 'Films that matter', Kanopy offers a curated library featuring award-winning documentaries, classic and world cinema, and a selection of Criterion Channel titles with more than 20,000 titles in total. This makes it an excellent choice for students, educators, and anyone with a strong interest in culture and learning. While the range of classic cinema isn\u2019t as extensive as paid services like the Criterion Collection, Kanopy still provides a rich selection of thought-provoking content, including some notable films from recent years. Kanopy updates its content regularly, with new titles added on a weekly basis.\nThe user interface is sleek and straightforward, with a dark background and thumbnail layout that (like most other services in this list) resembles a simplified version of Netflix. Kanopy is available on lots of devices, including smart TVs, smartphones, tablets, and web browsers, making it a really accessible choice. However, it doesn\u2019t support offline downloads, which could be a drawback if you want to watch content on the go without an internet connection.\nAnother notable limitation of Kanopy is that the number of titles you can watch each month is determined by your library\u2019s subscription plan. Typically, users receive a certain number of credits (e.g., 10 credits for 10 films) at the start of each month, which they can use to watch movies.\nDespite this limitation, the ad-free experience and high-quality content make Kanopy a valuable addition to your streaming lineup, particularly if you want to supplement your paid-for services with more educational content and independent films. For US readers, a similar service called Hoopla also provides free streaming with a library card, offering another alternative if ad-free educational content is a priority for you.\nThe best streaming service for Roku devices\n5. The Roku Channel\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReasons to watch\n\u2705 Great library of content: The Roku Channel gives you 80,000 free movies and TV shows, along with more than 350 live TV channels in the US. There\u2019s a good mix, too, including classic films, popular TV series, and Roku Originals.\n\u2705 Roku originals and exclusive content: There\u2019s some decent original programming on The Roku Channel, including exclusive shows and movies. Will they win awards? Probably not. Are they fun and entertaining regardless? Yes.\n\u2705 Integrated streaming experience: If you have a Roku device, The Roku Channel can integrate with all of your other streaming services, making it easier to access your content in one place.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c Limited access to new releases: The content library on offer has a wide selection, but it can feel like it\u2019s lacking the latest blockbuster movies and TV shows. There are some, but it doesn\u2019t feel as fresh as rivals.\n\u274c You need a Roku device: Yes, The Roku Channel is accessible on other devices, but you\u2019ll get the best experience with Roku hardware.\n\u274c No way to download for offline watching: This is the case with most FAST services in this guide, but you might have assumed that with a Roku device it would be possible to watch offline, you'd be wrong.\nIs The Roku Channel worth watching?\nThe Roku Channel launched in 2017 and it\u2019s a great choice for those with a Roku streaming device or TV, as it integrates seamlessly with Roku\u2019s ecosystem. However, The Roku Channel is not limited to Roku devices anymore. It can also be accessed via web browsers or the Roku app on a range of different devices. Guest users can watch content without signing up, but creating a Roku account does bring some added benefits, like the ability to pause and resume content and save things you\u2019ve watched as favorites.\nThe Roku Channel is also appealing for Roku users as it can centralize your streaming experience by integrating multiple services all within the Roku interface. This allows Roku device owners to manage various subscriptions, as well as premium add-ons like Starz, Showtime, and Paramount Plus, all from the one platform.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nThe Roku Channel has a content library of more than 80,000 movies and TV shows, along with more than 350 live TV channels in the US (it launched in the UK with more than 10,000 in 2020), catering to a broad audience. Whether you\u2019re interested in classic films, popular TV series, or new and exclusive Roku Originals, you\u2019ll find there\u2019s something to watch here. The Roku Channel continues to expand its own original content library, providing exclusive shows and movies that are not available on other free services. They\u2019re not all worth your time, but some are fun. Additionally, The Roku Channel offers access to Crunchyroll's FAST channel, dedicated to anime.\nAs an ad-supported service, The Roku Channel includes commercial breaks during viewing, but these are comparable to what you\u2019d experience with traditional TV, making them relatively easy to tolerate. While the library is extensive, it may not always include the latest releases, so users seeking the newest content might need to supplement with other services.\nThe Roku Channel is an excellent option for anyone looking for a broad range of free entertainment, particularly for those who already own Roku devices. However, as an alternative, you might also want to consider Xumo Play, a free streaming service from Comcast and Charter that\u2019s compatible with Xumo devices and available on platforms like Sky Glass and Amazon Fire TV in the US and the UK.\nThe best free streaming service for Amazon devices\n6. Amazon Prime Video\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReasons to join this month\n\u2705 Excellent library of content: Prime Video offers a massive selection of movies, TV shows, and original series. With the addition of Freevee's free content, the selection is even better.\n\u2705 Free access for non-subscribers: You don\u2019t need to be a Prime member to access some of the free, ad-supported content, making it an accessible choice (but you do need to have an account).\n\u2705 Broad device compatibility: As its one of the most popular streaming platforms, Prime Video is available across all sorts of devices, including smart TVs, streaming sticks, smartphones and browsers.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c Expect a lot of ads: This is standard from a FAST service. But you do need to accept regular ads, which can sometimes feel excessive.\n\u274c Watch out for location restrictions: Some content will vary by region. Although this is to be expected, access to certain titles could be limited.\n\u274c Premium content needs a subscription: While free content is available, accessing Prime Video\u2019s premium library requires a subscription. The split between free and paid options might feel confusing or less seamless for some users.\nIs Prime Video worth watching?\nWe know what you\u2019re thinking. Prime Video isn\u2019t free, is it? Well, the answer is yes and no. Until December 2024, Amazon offered a separate FAST service called Freevee. But Freevee is shutting down and its free content is being added to Prime Video. This makes Prime Video the central hub for both free, ad-supported titles \u2013 marked as 'Watch for Free' in the Prime Video app \u2013 and its premium, subscription-based offerings.\nWith this recent integration of Freevee's library, Amazon Prime Video now offers a wide selection of free, ad-supported content alongside its premium offering. This makes it a really appealing option for if you want a diverse range of entertainment without a subscription, alongside an option to get a subscription if you see something premium you can\u2019t resist.\nWhile it may not be the most polished streaming platform out there, it does offer a user-friendly interface and excellent compatibility across devices, including smart TVs and smartphones. You should expect ads on the free content, as well as regional limitations depending on where you\u2019re watching from. But for the breadth of content available \u2013 both free and paid \u2013 Prime Video is a choice that\u2019s well worth considering.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nAmazon\u2019s decision to shut down Freevee and merge its content with Prime Video feels like a strategic move to consolidate its streaming offerings and \u2013 we hope \u2013 simplify the user experience. By offering both free, ad-supported content and premium subscription options on one platform, Amazon can cater to a broader audience while using Prime Video\u2019s established brand recognition. This approach has huge potential. It could make content easier to discover, attract new viewers, and convert non-paying users into subscribers. However, its success will depend on reception to ads, the platform\u2019s ability to balance diverse audience needs, and maintaining a robust library \u2013 all while ensuring content is clearly labelled between the different types to avoid confusion.\nAmazon\u2019s Prime Video is accessible across a range of devices. Including smart TVs, streaming devices (including Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, and Roku), gaming consoles, PlayStation and Xbox, mobile devices via apps for iOS and Android, and web browsers on both Windows and Mac computers. What we\u2019re saying is you can watch Prime Video almost anywhere with almost anything.\nUsers can now watch some free, ad-supported titles alongside premium subscription-based TV shows and movies. Free content is labelled with a 'Watch for Free' tag or a Freevee logo (but that will likely be phased out with Freevee shutting down), which should help users distinguish between free and premium content. The free content is ad-supported, which means you\u2019ll see ads periodically.\nThe best free streaming service for Samsung TVs\n7. Samsung TV Plus\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReasons to watch\n\u2705 Easy to access with a Samsung TV: Samsung TV Plus comes pre-installed on all Samsung smart TVs from 2016, as well as on some Galaxy devices and monitors from Samsung. This makes it convenient \u2013 no additional subscriptions or downloads required.\n\u2705 No sign-up required: Unlike other streaming services, Samsung TV Plus doesn\u2019t require you to create an account or hand over any personal information to start streaming.\n\u2705 A good mixture of content: It doesn\u2019t have the greatest library in this list, but with more than 250 channels in the US, the mixture of entertainment, kids shows, drama, sports and news is good for families with a lot of different preferences.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c Device limitations: Obviously, if it\u2019s only available on Samsung devices, if you don\u2019t have one you can\u2019t use the service. There is a web version for US users, but you won\u2019t get the best experience.\n\u274c Few blockbusters or exclusives: You\u2019ve got a good selection of movies and shows here, but don\u2019t expect the latest premium content or high-quality originals you might find on one of the best paid-for streaming services.\n\u274c Some old and repetitive content: With the channel setup, some content can feel repetitive. A lot of TV shows and movies are also quite old.\nIs Samsung TV Plus worth watching?\nSamsung TV Plus launched in 2015 and it\u2019s Samsung's own FAST service that\u2019s designed to integrate seamlessly with the company\u2019s devices, like the best Samsung TVs and best Samsung phones. The app comes pre-installed on all Samsung smart TVs after 2016 and it\u2019s also available on select Galaxy smartphones, as well as other Samsung devices with a screen, like tablets and even smart fridges. This integration makes it convenient if you\u2019re a Samsung user, as you can watch content without needing to download additional apps or sign up for an account \u2013 just turn on your TV, and you\u2019re ready to go.\nAlthough this does mean that Samsung TV Plus is exclusive to Samsung devices and you won\u2019t find it on other platforms or as an iOS app. While there is an Android app, it\u2019s only compatible with Samsung phones. For those in the US, however, the Samsung TV Plus is available online. Meanwhile, those in Europe, can also access Samsung TV Plus via Sony One, which brings a collection of 54 FAST channels to Samsung and LG TV owners.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nWith Samsung TV Plus, you get access to more than 250 TV channels in the US and thousands of on-demand movies and TV shows, covering a lot of genres from news and sports to entertainment and kids\u2019 programming. You\u2019ll recognize some of these channels, like CBS News, NBC Sports, BBC Food, and dedicated movie channels. But the exact channels you get will vary based on your location. Similar to other FAST services, some of these channels aren\u2019t channels in the traditional sense, but are instead based around themes, which can make some of the content feel repetitive.\nThere\u2019s a good amount of content on offer here and a great mix. But don\u2019t expect to find the latest blockbuster releases or premium originals that you might get on subscription-based services. Although the platform does feature movies, it also tends to be stronger in kids' programming and TV shows.\nAs with other free streaming services, Samsung TV Plus is ad-supported. The frequency of ads varies depending on the channel you\u2019re watching, with some showing ads as frequently as every ten minutes, while others might have longer intervals that go 30-minutes without seeing an ad. When ads do appear, however, they do tend to be long.\nFor Samsung device owners, Samsung TV Plus is a no-brainer for free, easily accessible entertainment. However, it\u2019s worth noting that other TV manufacturers offer their own FAST services. For example, LG TVs get LG Channels, TCL owners get the TCL Channel, and Vizio offers Vizio WatchFree Plus are all solid alternatives, with LG Channels and Vizio WatchFree Plus even offering access to Crunchyroll's FAST channel, too, appealing to anime fans. If you\u2019re in the market for a new TV, these alternatives might be worth considering.\nThe best free streaming service for LG TVs\n8. LG Channels\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReasons to watch\n\u2705 Plenty of live TV options: LG Channels offers more than 300 live channels in some regions. Depending on where you live, that can include entertainment, news and sports.\n\u2705 Integrated with LG smart TVs: If you own an LG smart TV, LG Channels is already pre-installed and that means it seamlessly integrates into the webOS platform\n\u2705 Free and ad-supported: No subscriptions or accounts required, LG Channels is free to use and ad-supported, so as long as you have an LG TV, you can get watching without hassle.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c Limited on-demand library: The live TV options are good, especially in some regions, but the on-demand channels aren\u2019t as impressive as some other services.\n\u274c Available only on LG TVs: LG Channels is optimized for LG smart TVs and isn\u2019t available on other platforms.\n\u274c Ads are frequent: As with most other free services in this guide, you\u2019ll need to expect regular ads while watching.\nIs LG Channels worth watching?\nLG Channels is a free, ad-supported TV service built directly into LG smart TVs running webOS 3.5 or newer. It gives users access to a selection of live TV channels and some on-demand content, with a choice of more than 150 channels in total, without the need for a subscription or account.\nThe service focuses on live TV options across news, sports, and entertainment, featuring channels like Bloomberg TV, PBS Kids, and NBC News Now. It\u2019s a convenient choice for casual viewers and cord-cutters looking for a cable-like experience. However, the availability of channels depends on your location, with notable differences between regions, like the US and UK.\nWhile LG Channels excels in live TV, its on-demand catalogue is currently limited and leans toward older titles rather than new blockbuster releases. This isn\u2019t surprising for a FAST service, but other platforms, like Tubi, may offer better options for on-demand content.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nLG Channels is specifically designed for LG smart TV owners, and its limited availability on non-LG devices makes it less accessible than universal platforms like Pluto TV. What we're saying is, if you\u2019re not already part of the LG ecosystem, look elsewhere. However, for LG users, the seamless integration with webOS ensures a smooth experience without the need to download extra apps or switch devices. It's worth mentioning if you don\u2019t see LG Channels on your TV, you may need to activate it in your settings.\nOnce activated, LG Channels features an intuitive, full-page channel navigation menu similar to other services in this guide. Its live offerings include a balanced mix of general entertainment, kids\u2019 programming, and news, making it a solid option for families and casual viewers. Just be sure to check what\u2019s available in your region, as the selection varies. This can be especially important if you\u2019re deciding between an LG or Samsung TV based on the quality of their free content.\nHow to choose the best free streaming service\nWhen you're selecting a FAST service, it's helpful to understand that these platforms can generally be grouped by ownership: media companies, device manufacturers, or independent services. This should help you decide which is right for you based on the device you're using or your preferences.\nMedia company-owned services, like Pluto TV, often feature content that comes from their parent companies, like Paramount movies. Device manufacturers, including Samsung and LG, offer their own channels (that's Samsung TV Plus, LG Channels), which often come pre-installed on their devices, making them really convenient for users. Finally, independent services, like Plex, tend to be more versatile and they're accessible on a range of devices, making them a solid choice for those who prefer to watch TV shows and movies via a web browser.\nOf course, as these services are free, there's nothing to stop you from using a mixture of them depending on what your want to watch. For example, we haven't mentioned FlixHouse in our guide above because it feels a little niche, but that specializes in offering free indie movies. So you could pair it with a FAST service that offers more mainstream content, like Tubi.\nFor those interested in live TV, it\u2019s worth noting that while FAST services primarily focus on video-on-demand and channels based on themes and older content, some, like Sling TV, offer live streaming of channels too. However, there are plenty more live TV services, like YouTube TV, Fubo, and DirecTV Stream, which deliver a more traditional TV experience. That means you'll get real-time broadcasts, making these services ideal for news, sports, and event viewing.\nHow we test the best free streaming services\nIn our testing process, we primarily focused on the top four FAST services, Tubi, Kanopy, Pluto TV and Plex. That\u2019s because these services are widely available, especially in TechRadar\u2019s core markets of the US, UK, and Australia. Additionally, we considered several other major services based on their popularity and growth in the streaming landscape \u2013 but most of these are tied to specific devices and don't have the broad appeal of the first four.\nTo test them all, we explored the platforms thoroughly, evaluating what content is on offer in their libraries and assessing their user interface and any additional features that might be relevant for viewers. Our approach ensures that the recommendations are based on not only an in-depth understanding of each and every service, but of what our readers\u2019 needs and preferences are, too.\nThe best free streaming services FAQs\nWhat's FAST?\nFAST is the quick and easy way to refer to free streaming services and it stands for free ad-supported streaming television.\nFAST is a model that offers viewers access to on-demand, and sometimes live, TV without a standard subscription fee. Instead of paying, most FAST services require viewers to watch ads which are interspersed throughout programming \u2013 just like it used to be when we all watched traditional broadcast TV.\nWe\u2019ve collected together a range of the best FAST services in our guide above, like Pluto TV, Tubi and The Roku Channel. They\u2019re all prime examples of FAST and providing a range of channels and on-demand content across genres\nHow to stream movies and shows for free?\nStreaming movies and TV shows for free is now incredibly easy. This is thanks to all of the best FAST services, which offer content without subscription fees.\nWe've included all of the best options in our guide above. Including Tubi, Pluto TV, The Roku Channel, Plex and more.\nThese platforms are accessible on all sorts of devices, including smart TVs, streaming sticks, smartphones, and web browsers. While they are free, they are ad-supported, which means you should expect commercial breaks during your viewing.\nFor a more in-depth look at how these services work and how to watch content, take a look at our how to stream movies and shows for free guide.\nWhere to find new free content?\nStaying updated with the latest free content is easy. You can check directly with your favorite FAST service. New releases, trending TV shows or movies, and personalized picks are usually spotlighted on the homepage.\nBut even then, we know the sheer volume of options can feel overwhelming. That\u2019s where we come in. Each week, we publish curated roundups for US viewers highlighting the best free movies and shows across popular FAST platforms.

      "text": "Want to get the most out of your Netflix subscription? Stop making these 5 mistakes when choosing what to watch\nWe're all guilty of endlessly scrolling on Netflix trying to find our next favorite movie or bingeworthy TV show. But frustratingly, this can waste time and before you know it, half an hour has passed and you're still deciding.\nThankfully, there's some easy tricks to consider when it comes to Netflix in particular. The best streaming services all have their own libraries to navigate, and sometimes it can get confusing.\nSo, I'm here to recommend five ways to help you choose a title you'll love faster, that's maybe even worthy of a spot on our best Netflix shows or best Netflix movies list.\n1. Stop only choosing English-language titles\nYou're missing a whole host of great content if you ignore non-English language TV shows and movies. With Squid Game season 3 arriving soon, now is the perfect time to broaden your horizons.\nIf it's subtitles you're worried about, don't worry, because Netflix recently improved the quality of their dubbing. So whatever side of the 'subtitles vs dubbing' debate you're on, you can enjoy it properly. Whether you're watching intently or multi-tasking, Netflix has tools to help you.\nOnce you're done with Squid Game, I also recommend Money Heist and The Chestnut Man if you want to try something new.\n2. Don't rely too heavily on the Netflix Top 10\nIt might seem counterproductive but hear me out. If it's in the top 10, it's an indicator that lots of people are watching it, but that doesn't mean it's any good or that it'll be something you'll enjoy.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nTop 10 doesn't mean it's recommended for you, it's purely an indication of what everyone else is watching, which is great if you want to jump on the hype train, but you may be let down.\nA lot of the time, especially when it comes to TV shows, you'll be recommended series people have on a lot in the background or children's TV. Searching by genre or the recently added section is a better way to find new things suited to you, in my opinion.\n3. You're not making use of Netflix's secret codes\nPerhaps you didn't even know they existed, either. If you're anything like me, you'll want to check out the best Netflix horror codes, which is split into sub-genres, but there's so many for you to explore, such as Lady Whistledown's Whisper-Worthy Tales for Bridgerton fans.\nNeed some help and more recommendations beyond horror? Check out how to use Netflix secret codes for a step-by-step guide and every genre. This is a brilliant way to stop all that scrolling and find exactly what you're looking for.\n4. Stop avoiding shows because they've been canceled\nWhen it comes to streaming, there's few things more frustrating than a canceled show. Just when you were getting into something, suddenly, it's gone.\nBut I honestly believe there's some shows you should watch, even if you won't be getting any more episodes. Even if we didn't get much time with them, they're still highly entertaining. Check out these nine canceled Netflix shows that you should still watch, for something short and bittersweet.\n5. Don't judge a title by its cover art\nYou've all heard the saying 'don't judge a book by its cover', well, it applies here too. While the entire point of a visual library is to try and entice you in, it sometimes backfires massively.\nI've been served horror movies with really bad artwork or images that turned out to be good. The post apocalyptic movie Carriers was among these, at first I was unconvinced by the uninspiring cover image, but I had a very good time with it.\nTry watching the trailer or a clip instead, or just take a risk and dive right in. You might be pleasantly surprised!\nYou might also like\n- TV is dead, long live Netflix \u2013 streaming giant reveals first live TV plans as cable and broadcast hit new landmark low\n- I\u2019ve watched every #1 Netflix TV show in 2025 and these are the 7 actually worth streaming\n- Kia becomes the latest car giant to offer in-car Netflix \u2013 and as a father with young kids, I'm fully on board with the idea\nLucy is a long-time movie and television lover who is an approved critic on Rotten Tomatoes. She has written several reviews in her time, starting with a small self-ran blog called Lucy Goes to Hollywood before moving onto bigger websites such as What's on TV and What to Watch, with TechRadar being her most recent venture. Her interests primarily lie within horror and thriller, loving nothing more than a chilling story that keeps her thinking moments after the credits have rolled. Many of these creepy tales can be found on the streaming services she covers regularly.\nWhen she\u2019s not scaring herself half to death with the various shows and movies she watches, she likes to unwind by playing video games on Easy Mode and has no shame in admitting she\u2019s terrible at them. She also quotes The Simpsons religiously and has a Blinky the Fish tattoo, solidifying her position as a complete nerd.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "5 great free movies to stream on Pluto TV, Plex, Samsung TV Plus and more this week (June 9)\nGritty thrillers, emotional epics, and smart sci-fi, all free to stream this week\nIf you\u2019re looking for the best free movies to stream this week, we\u2019ve got you covered with some major crowd-pleasers. We\u2019ve picked five of the very best films available right now, spanning a mix of genres, including a stylish spy classic, a twisty legal thriller and an emotional epic.\nAll of the titles in our list below are completely free to stream on some of the top ad-supported platforms out there, including Plex, Pluto TV, Samsung TV Plus, Tubi and more. Of course, you\u2019ll need to sit through a few ads but it\u2019s a small price to pay considering there\u2019s no subscription fee or sign-up required. It\u2019s easy to see why the best free streaming services are becoming increasingly popular. Read on for our pick of five great free movies to stream this week.\n1. Mission: Impossible (Kanopy, Pluto TV, Prime Video)\nRelease date: 1996\nRotten Tomatoes score: 65%\nLength: 110 minutes\nDirector: Brian de Palma\nMain cast: Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Henry Czerny, Ving Rhames, Kristin Scott Thomas\nAge rating: PG-13\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning is currently playing in theaters, so there\u2019s never been a better time to catch up on the franchise. And there\u2019s no better place to start than with the original Mission: Impossible movie. Which, we\u2019re happy to report, still holds up incredibly well today.\nBefore the series evolved into the globe-trotting stunt-fest we all now know so well, the first Mission: Impossible was a tighter, slicker and much more paranoid thriller. Directed by Brian De Palma, it\u2019s packed with double crosses, disguises and that iconic, heart-pounding ceiling drop scene. The story follows Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise), a spy framed for a botched mission who must unravel a conspiracy from within. It\u2019s shadowy, suspenseful and full of compelling \u201990s espionage energy.\nIf you\u2019re ready to dive into the rest, you\u2019re in luck. Most of the franchise is available on free streaming services. You\u2019ll find Mission: Impossible 2, 3, 4, and Rogue Nation on Kanopy and Pluto TV now too.\n2. Moonlight (Tubi)\nRelease date: 2016\nRotten Tomatoes score: 98%\nLength: 111 minutes\nDirector: Barry Jenkins\nMain cast: Mahershala Ali, Ashton Sanders, Travante Rhodes, Andrew Holland, Janelle Monae, Jharrel Jerome, Naomie Harris\nAge rating: R\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nMoonlight is a deeply moving film that follows the story of Chiron (played by Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes) across three chapters, each set during a different period of his life, as he navigates his identity and upbringing in a tough Miami neighborhood.\nBarry Jenkins directs Moonlight with extraordinary care, and the performances are incredibly powerful. Especially from Mahershala Ali, who won an Oscar for his role as Juan, a man who becomes a father figure to Chiron. Yes, Moonlight is a coming-of-age story, but calling it only that somehow feels like a disservice. It\u2019s also a story about tenderness, sexuality, masculinity and the quiet moments that shape who we are.\nMoonlight won Best Picture at the 2017 Academy Awards and remains one of the most critically acclaimed films of recent times. It\u2019s not an easy watch at times, but it\u2019s an intimate masterpiece that you\u2019ll be thinking about long after the credits roll.\n3. Interstellar (Hoopla, Kanopy)\nRelease date: 2014\nRotten Tomatoes score: 73%\nLength: 165 minutes\nDirector: Christopher Nolan\nMain cast: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, Bill Irwin\nAge rating: PG-13\nIf science fiction isn\u2019t usually your thing, don\u2019t be fooled. Christopher Nolan\u2019s Interstellar is as much about wormholes and time dilation as it is about love, memory and survival. But if you do enjoy sci-fi? Oh boy, you\u2019re going to love this film and think about its impact for weeks (scratch that, months) afterwards.\nInterstellar is set in a bleak near-future where Earth is on the brink of total collapse. The story follows a group of astronauts, led by Joseph 'Coop' Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), on a mission to find a new home for humanity and the emotional fallout that follows.\nIt\u2019s big, bold, and full of heart. Yes, even with all of the science. You\u2019ll probably end up reading about wormholes and time travel afterwards. Not to mention, Hans Zimmer\u2019s score is skin-tingling and the visuals are jaw-dropping. If you\u2019ve never seen it (or haven\u2019t in a while), be warned, it\u2019s an epic. Emotionally draining, extremely long but entirely worth it. This is a space saga you\u2019ll want to get lost in, promise.\n4. Michael Clayton (Samsung TV Plus)\nRelease date: 2007\nRotten Tomatoes score: 90%\nLength: 120 minutes\nDirector: Tony Gilroy\nMain cast: George Clooney, Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton, Sydney Pollack, Ken Howard\nAge rating: R\nMichael Clayton is one of those rare thrillers that\u2019s both cerebral and incredibly tense. Which makes sense, given it was directed by Tony Gilroy, the writer behind the Bourne film franchise. George Clooney stars as a fixer at a top law firm, paid to clean up other people\u2019s legal messes. But when a colleague suffers a breakdown and he uncovers a cover up by one of the firm\u2019s major clients, Clayton is pulled into a dangerous web of secrets and corruption.\nIt\u2019s a sharp, slow-burning story about power and deceit with outstanding performances across the board. This might be one of our favourite roles from Clooney, though Tom Wilkinson and Tilda Swinton are also excellent \u2013 Swinton even won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance. If you love legal thrillers with grit, intelligence, and moral complexity, this is a must-watch.\n5. Winter\u2019s Bone (Plex, Prime Video)\nRelease date: 2010\nRotten Tomatoes score: 94%\nLength: 99 minutes\nDirector: Debra Granik\nMain cast: Jennifer Lawrence, John Hawkes, Kevin Breznahan, Dale Dickey, Garrett Dillahunt\nAge rating: R\nLong before The Hunger Games made her stratospherically famous, Jennifer Lawrence stunned critics and audiences in Winter\u2019s Bone. This haunting indie drama follows the story of a teenager named Ree (played by Lawrence), who sets out to find her missing father in the harsh Ozark wilderness. The film was adapted by Debra Granik and Anne Rosellini from the 2006 novel of the same name by Daniel Woodrell.\nIt\u2019s a quiet, cold, and deeply human story about resilience and survival with standout performances and a strong sense of place. It\u2019s also a stark reminder of how much power a small film can hold as it\u2019s gritty, slow-burning, and beautifully acted. Winter\u2019s Bone is another one of those films in this list that lingers long after the credits roll.\nYou might also like\nBecca is a contributor to TechRadar, a freelance journalist and author.

      "text": "What is JustWatch? The TV streaming service guide explained\nYour guide to Netflix, Disney Plus, Hulu and more\nWhat is JustWatch? If you\u2019ve ever scoured the internet to find which TV streaming service has a specific film or series available, you might have come across this online guide and smartphone app \u2013 one that collates together the title listings for a whole load of content services.\nJustWatch isn\u2019t a TV streaming service itself, though, and you won\u2019t be able to stream anything from within it \u2013 but it does offer a handy place to browse everything that is available to stream elsewhere, meaning you don\u2019t have to check apps individually to find what you\u2019re looking for.\nLet\u2019s face it: there are a lot of TV streaming services these days. While Netflix and YouTube may still be the dominant players when it comes to online streaming, there\u2019s now a host of competitors taking up our screen time. And in a world where Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, HBO, and Hulu and are all packed with programming, with content libraries cycling through different titles every month, it can be hard to keep with what\u2019s actually available.\nThat\u2019s where JustWatch comes in \u2013 and for everything you need to know about the platform, you\u2019ll find it all on this page.\nCut to the chase\n- What is it? An online guide to various TV streaming service catalogues\n- Which streaming services are included? Netflix, Disney Plus, Now TV, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, hayu, Mubi, Sky Go, All 4, Curzon, Chili, YouTube, Rakuten TV, and more\n- Where can I get it? iOS, Android, internet browsers, and Fire TV\n- How many countries does JustWatch operate in? 46\n- What does JustWatch cost? The service is free, with no advertisements\n- What about movie theaters? Yes, JustWatch lets you know what\u2019s showing in cinemas too\n- Can I stream stuff on JustWatch? No, but there are \u2018Watch Now\u2019 links for each title that lets you jump to the respective platform\nWhat is JustWatch?\nJustWatch is an online guide that collates the various films, TV series, and other types of programming available on online TV streaming services. There\u2019s a website you can open in any browser, and a smartphone app that\u2019s available on iOS and Android, as well as Fire TV devices.\nThis isn\u2019t a new idea: viewers have flocked to the internet to find out what show or film is landing where for years now, but JustWatch is different in its sheer scale. Rather than simply show what\u2019s streaming on a particular service (in the vein of What\u2019sOnNetflix), JustWatch enables you to skim through over 100 different content libraries to see what\u2019s available where, what quality resolution it\u2019s streaming in, how much it costs, and the kind of payment options available (subscription, rental, etc).\nYou can also filter the huge swathes of titles by the following categories: Movies, TV series, Release year, Genres, Price, Rating (i.e. IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes score) and Age rating.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThis means you can search en masse across various services, rather than simply scouting for a specific title, or having to go into Netflix, Amazon and Hulu separately to see what action movies or animated films are on offer.\nAs the JustWatch smartphone app puts it: \u201cGet personal recommendations for movies and TV shows available on Netflix, Now TV, Disney Plus and many more.\u201d\nJustWatch Netflix: all the TV streaming services\nYou\u2019ll find well over 100 TV streaming services included on JustWatch, from Netflix and Amazon Prime Video (both rentals / purchases and those included in a Prime subscription) to the likes of Syfy and CBS All Access. Other notable services include DC Universe, Disney Plus, Apple TV Plus, Acorn TV, Rakuten TV, Comedy Central, Hulu, and HBO Max / HBO Now / HBO Go.\nWe won\u2019t list all of them here, but you can head to the JustWatch website to check them out, as each TV streaming service gets an individual icon at the top of the content filters.\nAs to what\u2019s listed for each film or show, you can see when it landed on the respective service, how many episodes are available (if relevant), the streaming quality (SD, HD, 4K), and how much it costs on each platform for each resolution. You\u2019ll find a run-down of each episode title and synopsis, too, along with the cast and relevant titles you may also want to check out.\nThere\u2019s a watchlist feature, like the kind you get in Netflix or Disney Plus, that lets you tag titles you want to keep a tab on or remember to watch at a later point. You don\u2019t need to log in for this, either, as the information is stored through cookies in your browser \u2013 though to get this information across all your devices, you\u2019ll need to make an account (more on this below).\nEach title has a \u2018Watch Now\u2019 button that lets you jump right to the respective platform, too, so you can get right down to streaming.\nJustWatch UK: all the major players\nUK residents may be wondering whether your nation-specific catchup services are included. And they are! You\u2019ll find All 4, ITV Hub, BBC iPlayer, and BritBox all on the app. There isn\u2019t, however, a run-down of TV broadcasts, as this is an online-specific guide.\nJustWatch price, app and website\nMost importantly, JustWatch is free to use. You can make an account for a more tailored user experience \u2013 mainly in the form of emails that flag content it thinks you\u2019ll like \u2013 but it\u2019s also possible to use without making an account.\nThe About Us page for JustWatch is also surprisingly candid about how it makes its money, stating that user data is used to \u201ccollect user profiles of millions of cinema goers\u201d and target them for advertising on behalf of \u201cmovie studios, distributors and VOD services\u201d.\nYou\u2019ll find the JustWatch app on iOS and Android smartphones, as well as in internet browsers.\nIf you do sign up, you can do so with your Google or Facebook account, or by inputting an email address and password manually. Note that you will need to accept email marketing when you sign up, though you can head to your account settings after the fact to turn this off.\nShould I use JustWatch?\nJustWatch is a bit of a no-brainer for heavy TV viewers. It brings together a host of different content libraries, with effective filters and a constantly updated catalogue that reflects the ever-changing libraries of Netflix and the like. You don\u2019t even need to make an account to use it.\nIf you only subscribe or regularly use one or two services, and don\u2019t really fancy checking out any others \u2013 that is, if you\u2019re happy to be influenced more by your current subscriptions \u2013 it may be more of a hassle than simply searching for Netflix standup specials inside the app itself.\n- Check out the best Netflix shows and Netflix movies to watch\nHenry is a freelance technology journalist, and former News & Features Editor for TechRadar, where he specialized in home entertainment gadgets such as TVs, projectors, soundbars, and smart speakers.

      "text": "Best streaming service 2025: Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV+, Prime Video, and more compared\nThe best streaming service in June 2025\nThe best streaming service isn't a one-size-fits-all type of choice anymore. There are hundreds of niche services to choose from nowadays, which means you can find a streamer that's dedicated to showcasing a very specific type of content, from arthouse films and documentaries to horror and sports, and more \u2013 and not all are subscription-based either, with the rise of free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST).\nIn this guide, instead of recommending the single best streaming service, we've focused on the six biggest streaming services by global subscription numbers \u2013 Disney+ and Hulu, which we're recommending as a bundled subscription, Apple TV+, Max, Netflix, Paramount+ and Prime Video \u2013 to help you choose which one to sign up to this month. Why this month? Because each offers a very mixed library of movies and shows that changes from month-to-month.\nEach streamer is constantly adding and removing content as well as announcing new subscription changes, which can range from more ads and price hikes to password crackdowns and UI updates, so we've opted to evaluate each service's offerings on a monthly basis to help you decide whether it's worth keeping your subscription or canceling it for another. We've also included a small list of alternative streaming services to choose from to offer more variety outside of the larger streamers.\nI'm always on the hunt for the biggest new streaming hits and underground gems being added to the best streaming services, but I also keep tabs on every price hike, new feature and change (whether that's more ads or a password crackdown) to help make sure subscribers get the most out of the services they're signed up to. With the help of the streaming team, we look to assess each service as a complete offering to help make your subscription hopping decisions easier.\nThe best streaming service for most people\n1. Netflix\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReasons to join this month\n\u2705 You can't miss a new Netflix Original: Without a doubt, there's always a new Netflix show or movie being released on a weekly basis. In June, we've got the return of FUBAR, Ginny & Georgia, Squid Game and so much more.\n\u2705 You're a genre hopper: As one of the biggest streaming services around, Netflix has one of the most mixed catalogs available to browse, offering a lot of choice to those that have versatile content palates.\n\u2705 You want the latest features: Netflix is ahead of the curve when it comes to improving the tech on its platform. The latest being a major new homepage update that marks its biggest change to date and includes new AI search tools.\nReasons to switch this month\n\u274c You prefer to bundle your subscriptions: Netflix doesn't do bundles, so if you're after a good deal that lets you combine multiple subscriptions in one neat payment then we suggest looking to Disney+, Hulu, Max and Prime Video.\n\u274c You want a steady catalog to browse: Every month Netflix, is either canceling or removing a new batch of content, so you have to be quick to catch some movies and shows. Make sure to check everything leaving Netflix in June to not miss your favorites.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for a cheaper alternative: If you\u2019re wanting to save some money this month, then there are plenty of streaming deals to take advantage of \u2013 just don't expect to find a saving for Netflix though as it doesn't tend to offer discounts.\nNetflix is delivering a varied mix of titles in June 2025. Of the new additions, highlights include the return of series like FUBAR, Ginny & Georgia and Squid Game as well as the release of new movies like Tyler Perry's Straw, Our Times and Cheers to Life. Although June's list still adds up to close to 75 new additions, it marks a slight pullback in the number of new titles being added in May and April. Licensed titles make up a lot of the new releases, too, including these five new movies on Netflix with over 92% on Rotten Tomatoes that includes Rear Window, Us, Barbarian, The Town and more, there are a lot of movies to add to your watchlist. Of course, make sure not to miss any of the movies and shows leaving Netflix in June, which include some absolute bangers like Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy.\nIs Netflix worth subscribing to?\nIf you\u2019re looking to catch new hit Netflix shows like Bridgerton, Cobra Kai, Emily in Paris and The Umbrella Academy, then there's only one service where you'll find these titles. As arguably the most well-know streaming service with one of the biggest content libraries around, Netflix is often a staple in many households. But it can draw the ire of subscribers with its account changes and surprise price hikes. Not to mention its habit of canceling shows at the drop of a hat \u2013 in 2024, there were nine canceled Netflix shows that we found were still worth watching. If the cost of Netflix is not something you can justify this month, then it might be worth holding out for a potential free ad-supported Netflix but who knows when that will arrive.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nSave money with the best streaming deals and TV subscription coupons.\nDespite raising subscription prices several times over the past decade, introducing more ads by removing its Basic tier in June and clamping down on password-sharing, Netflix remains the most popular streaming service in the world. Its biggest draw? The shed tons of best Netflix movies and best Netflix shows that it has in its catalog, which also happens to be second largest compared to rivals. Although Netflix\u2019s movie library isn\u2019t as big as the 12,000 on Prime Video, there are a lot of highly-rated gems with Reelgood data showing that it had close to 4,000 titles in the US in 2023. It\u2019s the same story with TV shows after it started to scale back investments in production, with its list of close to 2,500 series beaten (only just) by 150 more from Hulu.\nBut it\u2019s not only about quantity, as it has quality Netflix Originals like Wednesday, Stranger Things, Dahmer: Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Show, Bridgerton, and The Queen\u2019s Gambit \u2013 all of which make up the five most-watched shows on the service with over 732 million views as of June 23, 2024. What\u2019s unique to Netflix is that the majority of its catalog is made up of originals. Granted, its studios don\u2019t have a seamless track record, with some seeing terrible reviews from critics, but many of its titles have been surefire hits, winning countless awards for shows like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black and movies like Roma and The Power of the Dog.\nThe service itself is also seamless. After all, the familiar \u2018tudum\u2019 greeting and interface we\u2019ve all come to recognize set the standard for streaming homescreens we know today, and has been copied by many of its rivals. That hasn\u2019t stopped Netflix from continuing to experiment, with plans to test major changes that\u2019ll make finding new movies and shows so much easier. On top of this, you can access high-quality streams in HD, 4K Ultra HD and HDR, which was updated to be Dynamically Optimized in late 2023 to improve brightness and color. Sure, it\u2019s not the cheapest streaming service, but in terms of its value proposition, Netflix is the most well-rounded offering.\nThe best streaming service for TV shows\n2. Disney+ and Hulu\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReasons to join this month\n\u2705 You want more bang for your buck: Want your hard-earned cash to stretch further? Signing up for one of the US-specific Disney+ and Hulu bundles is the way to go. The cheapest, which grants access to Disney+ and Hulu\u2019s full libraries, costs as little as $9.99 a month. You\u2019ll have to deal with ads but, compared to Max\u2019s $9.99 a month ad-based and Netflix\u2019s $7.99 per month ad-supported plan, it\u2019s a bargain.\n\u2705 You like adult and kid-friendly content: Disney+ is packed with family-friendly entertainment but, if you also enjoy movies and TV shows tailored for mature audiences, subscribing to Hulu instead of or alongside Disney\u2019s primary streamer will allow you to consume the best of both worlds.\n\u2705 You enjoy watching new movies regularly: Disney+\u2019s new movie offerings can be slim pickings on occasion. However, Hulu\u2019s movie library is forever being updated with new films to enjoy, so movie buffs will always have something new to watch. One of those Disney+ and Hulu bundles isn\u2019t looking so bad now, huh?\nReasons to switch this month\n\u274c You want lots of original content: As good as Disney+ and Hulu are, the number of movie and TV Originals that debut on both platforms isn\u2019t as high as their streaming rivals. If it\u2019s original content you\u2019re after, then, Netflix, Prime Video, and Max should be your go-tos.\n\u274c You like binge watching shows: Unlike Netflix, new episodes of Disney+ and Hulu shows are usually released on a weekly basis. So, if you\u2019re the type of person who likes to watch an entire series in a single sitting, neither of these services is the one for you. Again, Netflix is your friend on this front.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for new kid-friendly content: The House of Mouse has built a reputation on delivering family-friendly content worldwide. It\u2019s a pity, then, that April is looking pretty sparse for new child-friendly material on both platforms. Apple TV+ is slowly building out its kid-specific line-up of films and TV Originals, so switch to that service for programs like Be@rbrick and Jane\u2019s Animal Adventures if you\u2019ve run out of stuff to show your kids on Disney+.\nLooking at everything new on Disney+ in June 2025 and everything new on Hulu in June 2025, there's a big jump in new additions being added to each platform, particularly on Hulu, which is getting 91 new movies this month. That's a big change from previous months that saw much slimmer schedules. From the return of Phineas and Ferb and The Bear to the premiere of Marvel's Ironheart, we've got a stacked TV show watchlist for June. Outside of original content, there are a lot of licensed movies coming to Hulu. Among the 91 new titles, we've picked out these five new Hulu movies with over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes.\nIs Disney+ and Hulu worth subscribing to?\nTogether, Disney+ and Hulu are a great way for customers to watch every Disney live-action movie remake alongside other modern and old classics from Disney as well as every Pixar movie ranked best to worst. It's the streaming service duo that lets you watch the Star Wars movies in order and every Marvel Phase 4 movie and show, with the rest of Marvel's library, as well as Hulu Originals like The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and Only Murders in the Building. This way, you get the benefits of both streaming services, which includes different genres, channels and titles, to offer more variety than simply signing up for one.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nSave money with Hulu deals and ESPN+ promo codes or sign up for a Disney+ free trial or Hulu free trial to try out the services.\nThere\u2019s access to the best Disney+ movies like some of its most-watched movies Elemental, The Little Mermaid, and Taylor Swift The Eras Tour (Taylor's Version), Moana 2 and best Disney+ shows, including its most-watched originals like The Mandalorian, which is rumored to be getting a season four, WandaVision, Daredevil: Born Again and Loki, which released season two in October 2023.\nOn top of that you get access to all the best Hulu movies and best Hulu shows, which are updated every month with new additions and some titles removed. In fact, Reelgood data shows that in 2023 Hulu had the second-biggest library of TV shows at 2,656 \u2013 and grouped with Disney Plus' 576 the duo completely dwarf Netflix's 2,495 in comparison.\nFor sports lovers, there\u2019s also the choice of a bundle that has an optional third add-on for ESPN+ where you can watch live games, highlights, and documentaries all focused around sport, making it a well-rounded package. But there are some changes occurring at the House of the Mouse's streaming services. From announcing a price hike that went into effect at the start of 2024 alongside its password sharing crackdown in June 2024, it's mirroring a lot of Netflix's tactics so much so there are rumors it could soon make big Netflix-style changes to keep you glued to its shows.\nThe best streaming service for originals\n3. Apple TV+\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReasons to join this month\n\u2705 You love sci-fi: Apple TV+ has become a sci-fi utopia, boasting an epic lineup of critically acclaimed shows such as Silo, Foundation and For All Mankind. In June, fans of the genre can expect new episodes of Murderbot to enjoy.\n\u2705 You want a thrill: It's a busy month for Apple TV Originals, with new episodes of Car\u00eame, Murderbot and Long Way Home dropping throughout June, alongside the debut of new originals including The Buccaneers, Echo Valley, Not a Box and Stick.\n\u2705 You love book adaptations: Apple TV+ is home to many highly-rated book-to-screen adaptations that have scored over 86% on Rotten Tomatoes, including Drops of God, Pachinko, and Lessons in Chemistry.\nReasons to switch this month\n\u274c You can't afford to be subscribed to every service: Unlike other steamers like Disney+, Paramount+ or Hulu, Apple TV+ isn't known to offer many deals, so if you missed out on this year's rare 70% off offer then you might want to look elsewhere.\n\u274c You don't have a big household: Apple TV+ is one of the few streaming services that doesn't restrict account sharing still, making it a great option for anyone with larger families and friendship groups.\n\u274c You prefer more variety: Apple TV+ has one of the smallest libraries compared to the biggest paid-for streaming services. We'd suggest looking at Prime Video or Hulu if you're after more content like the best anime or best horror movies to browse.\nApple TV+ continues to deliver a high-quality lineup of original content every month and June is no exception. The standout titles from everything new on Apple TV+ include The Buccaneers, Echo Valley and Stick \u2013 indeed, it's these five new Apple TV+ movies and shows that we're most looking forward to streaming. That's only a small portion of the 10 new Apple TV+ titles coming in mid-2025, so there's plenty more on the way to enjoy too.\nIs Apple TV+ worth subscribing to?\nLoads of new Apple TV Originals content gets added to the platform every single month. From the Natalie Portman thriller Lady in the Lake to the dark comedy Sunny, there's a real mix of titles that you won't find on any other streaming service, alongside major productions that have become more popular like Severance season 2, Foundation season 3, Pachinko season 2 and Apple TV+\u2019s most-watched drama Presumed Innocent, which is getting a second season. If you haven't already read our Severance season 2 review, then hop to it because the final episode wrapped up another incredible season.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nSave money with Apple TV+ deals or sign up for an Apple TV+ free trial to try out the service.\nApple TV+ remains one of the best streaming services due to its original and high-quality content, which you can check out in our best Apple TV+ shows and best Apple TV+ movies. The streamer has produced some of TV\u2019s biggest shows, such as Ted Lasso and Slow Horses, and while it might not have a huge content library like Prime Video does, it prioritizes outstanding original material, with the likes of Lessons in Chemistry and Trying becoming huge successes for the platform.\nThe streamer has become the go-to destination for sci-fi TV shows with series like Dark Matter, Foundation, and Severance, and has also made a name for itself with its top-tier comedy content like Shrinking and, of course, Ted Lasso. Apple TV+ continues to expand its comedy library with buddy cop movie Wolfs and murder-mystery comedy Bad Monkey from Ted Lasso co-creator Bill Lawrence that is bound to bring in a large audience. Meanwhile, we are also looking forward to Severance season two and Foundation season three arriving on the streaming service.\nWhile Apple TV+ hiked its prices dramatically in 2023, the streamer offers a number of free trials for you to test out their stellar content and is ad-free for the price of $8.99 a month. Although this could be about to change after we reported that Apple has recruited a number of ad execs and had also been rumored to be testing a new AI-powered tool for optimizing App Store ads.\nAnother positive is that you also have the option to share a single subscription with up to five people, so your friends and family can enjoy the service while watching in 4K HDR video with immersive Spatial Audio that gives you a proper cinematic experience. While Apple TV+ might not be a replacement for other streaming services when it comes to quantity, in terms of quality they hit them out of the park for $9.99 / \u00a38.99 / AU$12.99.\nThe best streaming service for quality content\n4. Max\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReasons to join this month\n\u2705 Your favorite movie is one made by A24: The indie powerhouse has a multi-year deal with Max to stream its new movies exclusively, which means you'll be able to watch Parthenope in June.\n\u2705 You're a fan of HBO Originals: Max is the streaming home for everything HBO, including its fantastic back catalog of award-winning series like The Wire, Sopranos, Sex and the City, and more. In June, subscribers can expect The Gilded Age season 3.\n\u2705 You love Hollywood classics: There's a huge range of classic movies being added to Max from the early days of Hollywood in June thanks to a licensing deal with the Criterion Collection, such as Numbered Men, One Foot In Heaven, Presenting Lily Mars and more.\nReasons to switch this month\n\u274c You share your account: While it will take a while until Max completely enforces its new account sharing restrictions, it's still a blow to subscribers. Try Apple TV+ or Paramount+ to avoid the Max password sharing crackdown instead.\n\u274c You like browsing new content: Max's monthly new content schedules are notably a bit smaller than the likes of Prime Video, Netflix or Hulu. If you want a more fresh library, then we'd suggest looking to rivals.\n\u274c You value high-quality streams: If you have a high-tech entertainment setup, then you're going to want to pay for Max's most expensive tier to unlock 4K as it only streams in 1080p otherwise. For a more affordable high resolution, look to Apple TV+ or Prime Video.\nIf you're a fan of HBO shows, then yes absolutely. With new episodes releasing for The Gilded Age season 3 throughout June, you'll no doubt won't want to miss where this award-winning series goes next. There's a lot more on offer looking at everything new on Max in June 2025, too, with over 60 new licensed movie additions mixed in with HBO Originals, giving subscribers plenty of new releases to choose from. Out of these new Max movies, TechRadar's Entertainment writer Rowan Davies recommending these three movies on Max with 99% on Rotten Tomatoes.\nIs Max worth subscribing to?\nAs the home to HBO Originals, Max is the best streaming service to catch award-winning shows such as modern hits Game of Thrones, Succession, The White Lotus, The Last of Us, and now iconic series' The Sopranos, The Wire, and Sex and the City. Our list of best Max shows is ever-growing with new monthly additions, which means there are hundreds of hours worth of content to stream on the app. Indeed, the service has made a name for itself for offering quality originals, which is why we named it the best streaming service of 2023.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nUnfortunately the Max free trial had ended, but you can still save money by finding a Max deal.\nThis quality value for money extends to its movie catalog too, which admittedly doesn't have as many original productions but it does include classic and modern Hollywood films \u2013 just look at our picks of the best Max movies to get an idea of the types of critically rated films you can watch on the service. While it has less movies than TV shows (based on Reelgood data from 2023), that list is expanding thanks to new partnerships. In late 2023, Max made a multi-year deal with A24 to get the exclusive streaming rights for its theatrical releases for a limited time as well as over 100 of its movies added to its platform, making it a haven for indie film lovers,.\nMax is one of the youngest streaming services around, having launched in May 2023 after Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) merged HBO Max (its original streaming service launched in 2020) with Discovery. But that hasn't stopped it rolling out two price rises in the space of a year \u2013 the first time it raised prices for its ad-free service was in early 2023 followed by another shock subscription increase in June 2024. There are other options to sign up to the service though, with it joining Disney+ and Hulu in a bundle that will be available sometime in mid-2024. Max is also slowly expanding outside of the US and started being rolled out in Europe in May 2024 with plans to launch in Australia during the first half of 2025, but those in the UK will have to wait a bit longer still.\nThe best streaming service for classics\n5. Paramount+\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReasons to join this month\n\u2705 You're a Trekkie: Paramount+ is home to all the major Star Trek movies and TV shows, including the studio's first-ever made Star Trek TV movie Star Trek: Section 31, a spin-off that one of its stars revealed had a lot left out of it due to going through many iterations.\n\u2705 You love westerns: As the home of Taylor Sheridan western dramas (except forYellowstone, which is on Peacock), Paramount+ has all the prequels, sequels and spin-offs from the American filmmaker, including 1923 season 2, which will tell Yellowstone's chilling origin story.\n\u2705 You're a movie buff: Some of the most critically-acclaimed films are being added to Paramount+'s library in June; it's adding over 80 movies to its catalog. TechRadar's Rowan Davies recommends to start with these five with over 92% on Rotten Tomatoes.\nReasons to switch this month\n\u274c You prefer a larger content library: Out of all the biggest paid-for streaming services, Paramount+ is among the smallest because of its slimmer catalog of movies and shows. For more options, try Prime Video or Netflix.\n\u274c You don't like reality TV: Paramount+ is packed with reality series like Bar Rescue, Survivor, RuPaul's Drag Race and Big Brother. But if reality TV isn't your thing, we suggest looking at Prime Video or Netflix for more variety.\n\u274c You're not excited for Paramount Pictures movies: All new movies from the studio stream exclusively on the service after their theatrical run, so if you're not keen on the next Mission Impossible movie or Naked Gun remake, then you might be better off looking to Prime Video.\nParamount+ has another packed month of new additions in June 2025. It's adding 80 new films throughout the month, alongside eight new series. As usual, majority of the new additions are licensed movies. There's a great mix too \u2013 just look at these five new movies on Paramount+ with over 92% on Rotten Tomatoes for an idea of what's on offer. There's No Country For Old Men, 12 Years of Slaves, Pulp Fiction and that's only a small slither of what subscribers are getting alongside Paramount+'s existing library.\nIs Paramount+ worth subscribing to?\nParamount+ doesn't switch up its library as often as rivals, but it has a growing list of new movies and shows that it's adding each month. Outside of its expanding catalog, there's also been a lot of change at the service that has impacted subscribers, including rolling out a price hike in August and September 2024. There's also been change at the company level with Paramount agreeing to merge with long-time partner Skydance last year. As a result, we expect the streamer is about to embark on a new chapter that will likely mean more changes to its streaming service.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nSave money with these Paramount+ Coupon Codes for July 2024 or sign up for a Paramount+ free trial to try out the service.\nParamount+ has been a streaming service in flux. With the exception of Netflix, it is one of the oldest streamers around, having launched back in 2014 as CBS All Access (it was later rebranded to Paramount+ in 2021), and has scaled its offering quickly, attracting more than 60 million subscribers thanks to the success of Star Trek and Yellowstone. It's existing original content like this that mostly makes up the best Paramount+ shows and movies, and that means it's a bit limited in terms of its catalog, especially since it started removing multiple shows from its platform at the start of 2024 to help keep its business lean.\nThat cost-cutting approach, which has seen it raise subscription prices two years in a row since 2022 and combine its Showtime platform with Paramount+ to condense spending (Showtime stopped streaming in April 2024), could be set to change though, after it merged with its longtime partner on blockbusters like Top Gun: Maverick and Star Trek Into Darkness, Skydance in July 2024. While nothing is certain about what could change, it is likely that we'll see a fresh approach outlined, despite Paramount's chair Shari Redstone declaring at the time that content would remain king.\nWhile our pick of the best Paramount+ movies makes for an impressive list, it doesn't have the biggest range in the industry. In the US, it has the second smallest movie catalog (only Apple TV+ has less) at 803 titles, based on Reelgood data from 2023, which is half as many as it had in 2022. The number of series available, on the other hand, has largely stayed the same and was at 752 in 2023, and includes originals like Tulsa King, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, The Castaways, Special Ops: Lioness, Lawmen: Bass Reeves, and Mayors of Kingstown, which you can stream in 4K and Dolby Atmos with its premium plan.\nUnlock great savings with our Paramount Plus coupons. Enjoy premium streaming content at a fraction of the price with exclusive deals.\nThe best streaming service for movies\n6. Prime Video\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReasons to join this month\n\u2705 You want a big movie library: Prime Video has the biggest movie catalog compared to rivals and is known to consistently add over 50 new Prime Video movies every month, making it a great choice for those that want more choice.\n\u2705 You love Prime Video Originals: From Reacher and Invincible to The Boys and Rings of Power, Amazon has a growing slate of tentpole shows. In June, subscribers can expect the new Amazon MGM series We Were Liars and Countdown to debut.\n\u2705 You want the best quality streams for less: Prime Video's 4K ad-free plan is considerably cheaper than the equivalent tier at Netflix or Disney+, making it great value to access higher resolutions.\nReasons to switch this month\n\u274c You don't like ads: Prime Video has been ramping up the number of ads subscribers see ever since it introduced a more expensive tier in 2024. With the service reportedly doubling the ad time this year, we'd suggest looking at Apple TV+ instead.\n\u274c You don't have more than one subscription: Prime Video has a growing number of subscription add-ons you can choose from, making it a great hub for those signed up to several services. If that's not important to you, try Netflix or Paramount+.\n\u274c You don't have Amazon Prime: If you're not a regular Amazon customer then it doesn't make sense to be a Prime member, even if you do get free access to one of the best streaming services. We'd suggest Apple TV+ or Peacock for a cheaper alternative.\nPrime Video continues to add bumper lists of new movies and shows every month, but looking at everything new on Prime Video in June this month is a slightly smaller than usual. There are only 50 new movies being added to the service, with the biggest standouts being the sequel to the streaming debut of the horror hit Nosferatu. Among the licensed new flicks are some old favorites like these five new Prime Video movies with over 91% on Rotten Tomatoes, which include 12 Angry Men, Dead Man Walking, Moneyball, Some Like It Hot and more.\nIs Prime Video worth subscribing to?\nDespite Prime Video introducing ads at the start of 2024 unless you pay an extra $2.99 a month to get rid of them, it still remains as one of the most popular streaming services due to its sheer range of content. While the skippable ads may be off-putting, it still offers a lot of value, especially considering its free with an Amazon Prime membership. Its not just quantity over quality either, as the best Prime Video movies and best Prime Video shows allow you to get a lot for your money. Prime Video also has more titles available than Netflix and Disney+ (although Hulu does reportedly have a larger library of TV shows in the US).\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nSave money with the best streaming deals and TV subscription coupons or sign up for a Prime Video free trial to try out the services.\nIt's no surprise, then, that Prime Video usually prioritizes its movie selection over its TV shows, but Amazon Studios has paid a lot of attention to producing original content in recent years and it\u2019s certainly paid off, with Reacher, The Boys, The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, The Tomorrow War, The Rings of Power, Fallout and The Summer I Turned Pretty all becoming hit shows.\nAccording to JustWatch, Prime Video has over 26,300 movies and more than 2,700 TV shows in the US. The sheer size of its catalog doesn\u2019t outweigh the quality though as its Originals have won 75 awards and has been nominated a staggering 246 times. It\u2019s well known that Amazon tends to focus a lot of their attention on movies and their colossal film library is thanks to them buying MGM Studios in 2022. This factor combined with their other licensing deals allows us to stream the likes of Licorice Pizza, Creed, Skyfall, Casino Royale, and Hotel Rwanda.\nPrime Video also gives you the ability to buy and rent content, which has both positives and negatives. Although this allows users to have more choice, the paid content is mixed with free content, which can be frustrating when you search for something to watch, only to find you have to pay for it. This can be changed when you switch to the \u2018Free to me\u2019 section, but you can\u2019t make this the default, so it would be easy to forget to select this option every time you scroll through the content mines. Despite its flaws, there\u2019s something for everyone on Prime Video, so there\u2019s a lot of value for your money.\nAlternative streaming services to consider\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nOutside of the biggest paid-for streaming services listed above \u2013 Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Apple TV+ and Paramount+ \u2013 there are still plenty of other video on-demand platforms still to consider from.\nWhile we haven't listed every single one of these here, below you'll find three other services to consider outside of the incumbents. Some of these streamers are owned by TV networks like NBC Universal's Peacock and Dish Network's Sling TV, while others are independent film distributors like Mubi.\nThe best streaming service for cinephiles\n7. Mubi\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReasons to join this month\n\u2705 You like unusual and exclusive film releases: Mubi will often add exclusive releases and critically acclaimed films you can\u2019t find on other platforms, like critically-acclaimed masterpiece The Substance.\n\u2705 You want new picks every time you log on: A new film is added daily, which means the movie library is constantly refreshed along an expert take about why you should watch it.\n\u2705 You like perks: Subscribers to the highest tier, Mubi Go, receive a weekly ticket to watch a curated film at the movie theater for no additional cost \u2013 only in certain regions.\nReasons to switch this month\n\u274c You prefer mainstream content: If your preference leans towards blockbuster movies and TV shows, Mubi's library won't cater to your tastes. Some new releases are here, but not the mainstream kind. Head over to Netflix, Hulu or Max instead.\n\u274c You like a choice of movies and TV: There are some documentaries and shorter films available here, but Mubi mostly focuses on films. You'll never find a popular boxset added to Mubi like you would on Prime Video.\n\u274c You want loads and loads of choice: Compared to larger streaming services, Mubi's library is more limited. That's sort of the whole point, focusing on quality over quantity, but that won't appeal to everyone. For a more varied mix, try Prime Video or Netflix.\nIs Mubi worth subscribing to?\nMubi is a streaming service created with cinephiles in mind, offering a curated collection of international and independent films that are often hard to find anywhere else. It also streams some exclusives, like The Substance, Bird, Cow and Grand Theft Hamlet.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nMubi\u2019s commitment to quality over quantity shines through its handpicked daily additions, which mean the library is continually refreshed with top-tier titles. For fans of thoughtful storytelling, arthouse films, and world cinema, Mubi offers a unique viewing experience that stands out in a crowded streaming landscape.\nWhile Mubi does offer a seven-day free trial, it lacks a free version. Subscribers can choose between the standard plan or Mubi Go, which is more expensive and includes weekly movie theater tickets to select films, bridging the gap between streaming and theatrical viewing. All content on the platform is ad-free. Adding to its curated charm, each movie comes with an insightful \"Our Take\" section, offering thoughtful commentary \u2013 a refreshing upgrade from a small synopsis, which most rivals give you.\nThat said, Mubi's niche focus and limited library may not appeal to those looking for mainstream blockbusters or a huge amount of choice. What\u2019s more, the higher cost of Mubi Go might deter budget-conscious viewers. However, if you love arthouse and independent cinema, Mubi provides unparalleled access to festival favorites, cult classics, and works by emerging directors. If you value quality, unique content, and thoughtful curation, Mubi is a great choice.\nThe best streaming service for live sports\n8. Peacock\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReasons to join this month\n\u2705 You want loads of choice: There\u2019s so much content on Peacock, including TV shows, movies, live channels, love sports and more. With programming from the likes of NBC and Bravo. Right now you can watch top TV shows like The Office, Yellowstone and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.\n\u2705 Live sports are a priority for you: One of the top options for sports, on Peacock TV you can watch events like the WWE, Olympics and some Premier League soccer games live. You can also access analysis and replays too.\n\u2705 You want exclusives and specials: Stephanie Hsu\u2019s new comedy Laid will land exclusively on Peacock. It also gets access to other big hit shows too, like Eddie Redmayne\u2019s The Day of The Jackal \u2013 just renewed for a second season.\nReasons to switch this month\n\u274c You don\u2019t like NBC Universal movies and shows: As the company's streaming service, Peacock is the exclusive home to NBC Originals, NBC and Bravo hits as well as much much more.\n\u274c You want more variety: Peacock has one of the smaller content libraries out of all the big streaming services, making its offering a lot more limited. For a more varied mix of shows and movies, look at Netflix, Prime Video and Hulu.\n\u274c Limited originals: Look, there\u2019s a really great choice here, especially at the time of writing. But while Peacock\u2019s original series and exclusives are great, they\u2019re not going to compete with the likes of Netflix.\nIs Peacock worth subscribing to?\nPeacock TV is NBCUniversal's streaming service. It offers a wide range of content, making it a good alternative to cable and live TV. Subscribers gain access to popular TV shows, movies, live sports, and a handful of exclusive originals.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nThe service operates on a tiered subscription model, offering two main plans, Premium and Premium+. Although the lower cost Premium tier undercuts many rivals, it comes with limitations, like ads, no offline downloads, and restricted access to some channels. We think it makes sense for most people to get Premium+, which eliminates ads (with a few exceptions for live broadcasts), adds downloads for offline viewing, but does cost extra.\nWhen it comes to TV shows, Peacock TV currently has many great hit NBC series and boxset favorites, like The Office, Yellowstone and Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Movies are varied, with some older classics and a couple of releases from the past year. Sports fans will love what\u2019s on offer here, including live coverage of WWE, Olympics and Premier League soccer games, all live alongside some analysis and replays, too.\nPeacock TV doesn\u2019t have as many exclusives as the likes of Netflix or Disney+, but you will also find some movies and TV shows that are only on Peacock, especially around seasonal periods. It\u2019s worth mentioning there are regional restrictions on some content, this is the case with all streaming services, but be sure to check what\u2019s available where you live before signing up.\nPeacock stands out as a versatile streaming service option. Although there are some great new movies and exclusives on the platform at the time of writing, we think it makes the most sense for fans of live sports, NBC series and older boxsets. If access to a wide range of programming is important to you and you don\u2019t mind either coping with the limitations of Premium or paying extra for Premium+, it\u2019s a very solid choice and could definitely make sense for some people over more popular platforms, like Netflix and Disney+.\nThe best streaming service for a cable TV replacement\n9. Sling TV\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReasons to join this month\n\u2705 You want to customize your streaming experience: Sling TV is a bit different to rivals. You can pick which plan you want and then select add-ons to customize the experience to you, adding additional features (like DVR) or channels, like more entertainment or more sports.\n\u2705 You want to replace cable TV: Some of the rivals in this list are better when it comes to exclusives or the best movies. But if you want an all-in-one choice that best replicates cable TV, Sling TV is one of the best picks.\n\u2705 You want DVR capabilities: One of the few services that let\u2019s you record live TV and pause it. Although you will have to buy an add-on to unlock this feature.\nReasons to switch this month\n\u274c You want a simple experience: We said the fact you can customize Sling TV will be a pro for some people. For others who just want a good choice of TV shows and movies, it\u2019ll be too confusing and a simple and solid option like Netflix will be better suited to you.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want to pay extra for add-ons: Some people will like the fact they\u2019re only paying for what they\u2019re watching. But if you want to watch a wide range of content and value movies just as much as sports, prices can quickly rack up. You might also find these add-ons included in other packages for less.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want prices to increase: To be clear, this happens across every streaming service, it\u2019s not just Sling TV. But at the time of writing, Sling TV had introduced a pretty hefty price increase that still makes it good value in some respects, but it\u2019s not as easy to recommend to everyone.\nIs Sling TV worth subscribing to?\nSling TV is a streaming service that we think most feels like traditional cable than any other option in this guide. Interestingly, it also offers a customizable and flexible way to watch live TV. Sling TV introduced a recent price hike, but plans still start at a fairly affordable price \u2013 especially if you\u2019re comparing them to cable packages. For this reason, it\u2019s a good choice for budget-conscious viewers looking to cut the cord without sacrificing access to popular live channels or sports.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nOne of Sling TV\u2019s standout features is the fact you can customize your channel line-up and even some features. Subscribers can tailor their plans to begin with, choosing from Sling Orange (best for sports and family content), Sling Blue (best for TV and documentaries), or a combination of both. From there, you can buy add-ons for specific genres, like more sports or entertainment. Or specific channels, like Starz or Paramount+ with Showtime. You can also add a DVR feature, which allows you to record and watch back later. This customizable approach means you only pay for what you\u2019re going to watch.\nSling TV\u2019s breadth of content is great, but there are some limitations. Local channels, including ABC, NBC, and Fox, are only available in some regions, which could be a drawback for viewers who rely on them for news and sports. Also, while Sling TV starts out at a competitive price, the customizable approach can quickly rack up big costs. For some people, paying for only what you want to watch will work out cheaper than rivals. If you plan to get all sorts of add-ons, it might end up being more expensive. We recommend doing the sums before you commit.\nFor those prioritizing affordability and flexibility, Sling TV is a solid option, especially if you prefer the idea of a personalized viewing experience. However, the price increase, limited local channel availability, and potential add-on costs make it a service we\u2019d recommend, but only if you\u2019ve considered rivals and worked out the costs of the add-ons you\u2019ll need first.\nHow we choose the best streaming services\nThis guide is not a definitive ranking of the best streaming services. That's because we don't believe that there's one single best platform to be signed up to anymore.\nInstead, to cater to the growing trend of savvy budgeters that pause and cancel their subscriptions depending on what they want to watch, we've updated the order of this list to reflect which services are offering the most value during this month.\nLooking at the content schedules of the biggest streaming services for June 2025, we've ordered this list to best reflect those that are adding the biggest new movies and shows, while also factoring in recent account updates like price hikes that impact subscribers.\nUsing these metrics as a methodology, we've reordered the best streaming services in this guide so you can see which is the highlight of the month, allowing subscription hoppers to save up to 71% on their streaming bills in 2025 by canceling any unnecessary subscriptions.\nMake sure to also check for any of the best streaming deals to see if you can get a discounted subscription or if you have to tighten the purse strings completely this month, then why not see what's on the best free streaming services instead.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAmelia became the Senior Editor for Home Entertainment at TechRadar in the UK in April 2023.

      "text": "6 best streaming apps on Android: our picks for TV, anime, film, and more\nYes, you can get Apple TV Plus on an Android phone\nWhen it comes to enjoying your favorite films and TV shows on an Android phone, there are tons of options available.\nIf you\u2019re of a certain age, you may remember a time when watching video of any length or quality on a phone was a complete novelty. Nowadays, though, in a world dominated by streaming services, it\u2019s never been easier to catch up on the latest must-watch content from the convenience of your pocket computer. That said, it's easy to feel overwhelmed as a result of this abundant choice.\nSure, you have the heavy hitters like Netflix, Disney Plus, and Prime Video, but there are plenty of smaller options, too, like Paramount Plus, which tend to boast exclusivity to certain franchises that make them worth a look. Then there\u2019s the additional problem of having access to different catalogs depending on your location, although our guide to understanding how a VPN can help with streaming should have you covered.\nSo, to help you get straight to the content that\u2019s actually worth watching, we\u2019ve gone ahead and isolated the top six streaming apps that you should absolutely have downloaded on your Android phone.\n1. Netflix (best overall)\nThere\u2019s no way we could start this list, or indeed any discussion about the best streaming apps, without first tipping our hat towards the absolute big dog of the scene. Netflix has all but become synonymous with streaming, having been the first platform to really capitalize on the concept, and in having such a lengthy head start, the company has been able to pack out its catalog of original content, as well as finesse the overall app experience.\nAt this point in time, Netflix has some gargantuan exclusives under its belt, a few of which have gone on to be worldwide phenomena. Shows like Squid Game, Stranger Things, and Bridgerton have become cultural touchstones, but the service continues to have lower-key hits like the recently released four-part series Adolescence.\nWorking in tandem with its exclusives is Netflix\u2019s vast library of licensed content, the likes of which are perfect for both binge-watching and background viewing. Shows like Friends, Gilmore Girls, and The Office are exactly why everyone tends to keep their Netflix subscription going at all times, while dipping in and out of other streamers.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWhile Netflix has a decent array of films at any one time, it hasn\u2019t had too much success in original films that really break through and dominate the conversation, beyond a small handful. Thankfully, there is an extra boon for Android users in the form of Netflix games, which throws in must-play titles like Civilization VI and Game Dev Tycoon, all at no extra cost.\nSpeaking of cost, Netflix has multiple subscription tiers available, ranging from budget to premium. At present, the entry-level cost for Netflix with Ads comes in at $7.99 / \u00a35.99 / AU$7.99. The standard tier, which costs $17.99 / \u00a312.99 / AU$18.99, drops the adverts and allows two devices to stream simultaneously, while the $24.99 / \u00a318.99 / AU$25.99 premium tier bumps the quality to Ultra HD.\n2. Disney Plus (best for kids)\nWhile it might have been a bit late to the game compared to Netflix, Disney Plus still had one major ace up its sleeve upon arrival: decades of established films and TV shows that already had a massive audience.\nUnlike Netflix, Disney was already a known quantity from the jump, which has allowed its streaming service to go from strength to strength over the last few years. The service scored a major win with having The Mandalorian available early on, which set the stage for plenty of other Star Wars-related shows to follow, including Andor and Ahsoka.\nDisney Plus also benefits from having dibs on all things Marvel, which is one of the hottest properties on the planet right now. From new shows set within the MCU, to being the first streamer to feature Marvel movies after they\u2019ve left cinemas, Disney Plus is an instant winner for any superhero fans who love to stay up to date with all things Marvel, and there\u2019s plenty of legacy content from 20th Century Fox for new fans who have yet to catch up.\nWhat elevates Disney Plus above Netflix, however, is its abundance of kid-friendly content that arguably makes it a must-have membership for any parents who need a few minutes of peace and something engaging to entertain their children. You\u2019ve got old greats like Alice in Wonderland and new hits such as Encanto and Moana 2, and this is before mentioning the Pixar collection, which features much-loved characters like Buzz, Woody, and Lightning McQueen.\nThe service has a similar three-tiered membership to Netflix, except it is (at the time of writing) a fair bit more affordable, especially in the UK. The ad-supported tier costs just $7.99 / \u00a34.99 / AU$15.99, while the Premium plan, with all the bells and whistles including 4K Dolby Atmos streaming, is set at just $13.99 / \u00a312.99 / AU$20.99, which may make it more appealing to those on a budget.\n3. BBC iPlayer (best free)\nIt can be all too easy when talking about streaming services to get swept by the big brand names like Disney and Netflix, but if there\u2019s one platform that has provided phenomenal value for an extended period of time now, it\u2019s BBC iPlayer. If you\u2019re in the UK and you already pay for a TV licence then you get access to iPlayer at no additional cost, and while the service isn\u2019t officially available outside of the UK, there is a workaround in our guide for how to watch BBC iPlayer from abroad.\nWhat\u2019s impressive about iPlayer is that for a free service, it has quite a rich library of varied content. As you would imagine, there are classic BBC shows available, including Top Gear, The Royle Family, and Planet Earth, but all of that sits alongside a ton of third-party content from other production companies. At the time of writing, you can dive into hit US shows like The Dropout, Dopesick, and Suits.\nWhat really elevates iPlayer, however, is the type of content that you can\u2019t really find elsewhere. You have access to live TV, which can include plenty of sporting events such as Wimbledon and certain football games, the likes of which other streamers haven\u2019t capitalized on in quite the same way.\nThere\u2019s also a ton of game shows that can be watched, so if, after a long day of work, you just want to zone out to a few episodes of Richard Osman\u2019s House of Games, there\u2019s nothing stopping you with iPlayer in tow. For the most jam-packed catalogue that doesn\u2019t cost a penny (beyond the licence fee), BBC\u2019s own-brand service is a tough one to beat on pure value.\n4. Mubi (best for cinephiles)\nWe mentioned earlier in this list that Netflix hasn\u2019t quite gotten its act together when it comes to offering compelling films that really strike up a discourse, and if you feel that you\u2019ve been missing a connection with all things cinema, then Mubi is the perfect remedy.\nFunnily enough, Mubi has been around almost as long as Netflix has, but the service has focused on one goal: delivering cult films from around the world to the comfort of your own home.\nTake it from us: if you consider yourself something of a cinephile because you love Martin Scorsese and the works of George Lucas that aren\u2019t Star Wars, you\u2019ve got a lot to learn. The moment you open up Mubi, it\u2019s a humbling experience as you\u2019re presented with films from across the decades and a range of genres, whether that be Indian dramas of the 2010s or underground queer cinema of the 1990s. There\u2019s a good chance that you haven\u2019t heard of most of the films that are on Mubi\u2019s radar, but that\u2019s what makes the service so much fun for discovering hidden gems that you would never see on the likes of Netflix or Prime Video.\nThe whole thing feels more curated than any other service, as if each film has been picked because it resonated with a member of the Mubi team. You can gather as much because with each film, not only is there a detailed synopsis, but there\u2019s also a paragraph explaining why the film in question is an important watch, what it\u2019s trying to say, and the context in which it was made.\nIn an entertainment landscape that definitely feels saturated, Mubi still feels unique in what it\u2019s trying to offer. Even its app design is far more aesthetically pleasing to the eye than what you\u2019ll find elsewhere. Films aren\u2019t squished into tiny boxes for you to tap on \u2013 they\u2019re given room to breathe on your phone\u2019s display. It almost feels a bit like what you\u2019d find in a museum, with descriptions that accompany a piece of art.\nIf you don\u2019t fancy spending all of your time watching films indoors, there is an expanded service known as Mubi Go, which, in addition to having access to the streaming service, grants you one cinema ticket each week to a film that Mubi recommends. Mubi Go will set you back $19.99 / \u00a318.99 / AU$19.99 a month, while Mubi on its own costs $14.99 / \u00a311.99 / AU$14.99, although there are student discounts available.\n5. Crunchyroll (best for anime)\nGiven how popular anime is around the world, it\u2019s a bit surprising that more streaming services haven\u2019t tried to cater to the genre. Sure, there are some hits on Netflix like Castlevania and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, but nothing comes close to providing a truly unfettered anime catalogue in quite the same way as Crunchyroll.\nIf there\u2019s an anime series out there that\u2019s worth watching, you can almost guarantee that it\u2019s available on Crunchyroll. The service currently has access to established franchises like One Piece, Naruto, and Dragon Ball Z, but there are plenty of newer hits, including Solo Leveling and Jujutsu Kaisen.\nAside from its ever-growing library of content, what makes Crunchyroll such a must-have for anime fans is that all episodes appear on the same day that they're broadcast in Japan. There\u2019s even a helpful guide within the app, telling you the exact local time at which the next episode of a given show will be available to stream. Those who remember having to wait months to enjoy localized versions of hit anime shows will no doubt appreciate just how much of a game-changer this is.\nIn a similar fashion to Netflix, Crunchyroll has also expanded into other areas of entertainment. There are plenty of mobile games available, all of which have an anime art style, but in a stroke of marketing genius, there\u2019s also a store within the app where you can buy merchandise of all your favourite shows. As a means of giving fans an easy pipeline to express their fandom via clothing, accessories, and more, it\u2019s a great feature to have.\nThankfully, the service is a bit cheaper than more mainstream competitors, with the most premium tier, \u2018Mega Fan\u2019, only costing \u00a359.99 a year in the UK and $15.99 / AUD $13.99 a month in the US and Australia, respectively.\n6. Apple TV+ (best for original content)\nThis is sure to anger some, but bear with us. Even though it originally had no presence whatsoever on Android phones, outside of trying to stream content haphazardly via a browser, Apple TV+ is now easily accessible via the Apple TV app for Android. Thank goodness, too, because Apple\u2019s streaming service is easily one of the best out there right now for original content.\nAside from a handful of licensed films, which have only been added to the US version of Apple TV+, the service consists entirely of shows and films that Apple itself has had a hand in producing. While the downside of this is that the service doesn\u2019t see quite the same level of quantity offered by the competition, it does leave the viewer with a bit more confidence that the content they do decide to watch is going to be of a certain quality.\nThere have been mega hits like Severance and Ted Lasso, which have helped to shape the platform\u2019s image, but there are plenty of lesser-known shows that are well worth jumping into, not the least because they have A-list actors fronting them. You have Harrison Ford in Shrinking, Seth Rogen in The Studio, and Gary Oldman in Slow Horses, just to name a few.\nBeyond scripted entertainment, Apple TV+ also has the streaming rights to Major League Soccer, so if you want to see big name teams like LA Galaxy and Inter Miami duke it out then you can do just that, although MLS matches do require you to purchase an additional season plan in order to tune in, currently price at \u00a314.99 / $14.99 (it's not currenlty available in Australia).\nBeyond that, though, there\u2019s only one membership option within Apple TV+, giving you access to the service for $9.99 / \u00a38.99 / AU$12.99 a month. There are student discounts available, and you can also get access to Apple TV+ as part of the Apple One bundle, which can include services like Apple Music and iCloud+.\nYou might also like\nAfter cutting his teeth covering the film and TV industries, Tom spent almost seven years testing the latest tech over at Trusted Reviews before heading out into the world of freelance writing.

      "text": "Every movie fan should use the Letterboxd app, and pay for Pro to solve streaming\u2019s big problem\nDuring the pandemic lockdown period in 2020, lots of people got deep into hobbies. Baking, drawing, whatever \u2013 mine was movies. Obviously, I already enjoyed films as much as the next person, but recently I'd been far more likely to bounce from show to show. During lockdown, I really got into the art of the movie \u2013 the structure, the form, the cinematography, the auteurism. Coming out of lockdown, this translated into me becoming a fixture at my local movie theater, where I still go three times a week regularly.\nThis is part of a regular series of articles exploring the apps that we couldn't live without. Read them all here.\nLast year, I watched 200 movies. The first movie I saw that year was The Matrix Resurrections, the last was Carol. My most-watched directors were Stanley Kubrick, Paul Verhoeven, and Sam Raimi (five each). I know these things not because I am a walking film encyclopedia, but because I can just look them up in Letterboxd. This app has been invaluable for helping me keep track of all my thoughts, and in solving the most annoying thing about having many streaming services.\nLetterboxd is a movie database, personal journal, and social network all in one. The basic use of it is simple: when you watch a movie, you can log when you watched it, and it keeps a diary for you. Easy.\nBut then you can add a star rating to the movie if you want, or Like that particular movie, or both. Or you can add a written review. But again, we're still keeping it simple, and just for yourself.\nBut when you look at a movie in the app, you'll see that you can view other people's reviews, and you can \"Like\" them or comment on them, and if you think they write fun and insightful reviews, you can follow them, and what they watch will show up on your main 'feed' screen. Now we're getting social!\nMaybe someone you followed reviewed a movie you've never heard of really highly \u2013 you can add it to your Watchlist within the app, making it easy to keep track of everything you really mean to watch, but don't get around to.\nWhen you look at a movie, you can see its cast and crew and you can then tap on them to see everything else they've done. When you discover some cool director you didn't know before, you can easily add their stuff to your Watchlist.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAnd you can make personal lists of movies \u2013 collections, ranked lists, whatever you want. You can add names and comments to these lists, so they feel like something personally curated.\nAll of these combine to make Letterboxd the app I love most right now. If someone asks me what my favorite movies of the year are, I can hop to my \"Best of 2023\" list to make sure I don't forget anything. If someone asks when I saw a particular movie, I can tell them. And you might think \"Who would ever ask someone that?\" But when people find out how often I go to the theater, they always ask something like this.\nI can use it to explore and find new movies, to expand how I feel about movies I already know by getting other perspectives, and to keep both sides of this organized in a way they wouldn't be in my head.\nThe advantages of going Pro\nEverything I mentioned above is free on Letterboxd. But I also pay for the Pro version for two reasons. One nerdy, one practical.\nThe nerdy reason is stats. As a Pro user, for the price of $19.99 / \u00a316.49 /AU$27.99, at any point, I can dig into my movie-watching stats. Who is my most-watched actor of the year? Which cinematographer has the highest average score rating on their movies from me? What was my 100th movie watched in 2022? Being a Pro user lets you explore all of this, and god help me, I love it.\nBut being a Pro gives you something even better: the solution to the big streaming problem that I mentioned. You can tell Letterboxd which streaming services you have, and whenever you view a movie on it, it'll tell you if it's available on any of them. Not only that but if something is on your Watchlist and it gets added to a service you have, you'll get a notification.\nIt's so simple. It's hardly some super-genius feature no one else could ever conceive of. But it's magic because it puts everything right there in one place. I go to Letterboxd to discover movies I didn't know. I go there to work out what to watch next. I go there to see if I can see a movie on my services. I go there to journal my thoughts after a movie.\nYou can get as into Letterboxd as you want to get, which I like about it \u2013 use it totally privately, or treat it as a fully social network. I keep things generally private, but I like to follow my real-life friends so I can know what they think about things, and I follow particular critics who I think have similar tastes to mine, or who just always have something interesting to say about surprising films.\nIt's like Reddit and IMDB mixed into one but without the worst parts of both.\nYou might also like\nMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Entertainment, meaning he's in charge of persuading our team of writers and reviewers to watch the latest TV shows and movies on gorgeous TVs and listen to fantastic speakers and headphones.
