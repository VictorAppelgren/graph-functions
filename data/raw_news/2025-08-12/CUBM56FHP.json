  "title": "A Lisbon lab is turning dead bacteria into dog treats. Next up: Human snacks",
  "description": "Dead bacteria for dinner? We went inside MicroHarvest\u2019s microbial protein lab to witness the future of food.",
  "content": "\u201cMicrobial protein,\u201d says Katelijne Bekers, waving a vial of beige-coloured powder in front of me like it\u2019s a magic potion. It doesn\u2019t look like your typical lunch fare, but this unassuming dust could play a crucial role in the future of food.\n\nBekers is the co-founder of MicroHarvest, a Hamburg and Lisbon-based startup that turns agricultural waste streams into protein powder using microbes \u2014 tiny organisms that exist all around us. The vegan ingredient is already making its way into dog treats. If all goes to plan, human snacks like protein bars, shakes, and ice cream won\u2019t be far behind.\n\nI visited the company\u2019s Lisbon pilot plant on a sweltering summer afternoon last month. It\u2019s tucked inside the Unicorn Factory, a sprawling industrial space on the city\u2019s eastern edge that used to churn out pasta and cookies for the Portuguese military. Now, instead of carbs for soldiers, it\u2019s housing bubbling vats of bacteria.\n\nAt the centre of the lab sits a large steel fermenter with a small porthole, through which you can see a thick brown soup gurgling away. Inside, billions of microbes are feasting on leftover sugars from the agri-industry, multiplying like microscopic gremlins. Once they\u2019ve done their job, they\u2019re killed and dried into protein-rich powder.\n\n\u201cWe prefer to say they\u2019re \u2018inactivated\u2019,\u201d Bekers, who is originally from the Netherlands, tells TNW with a chuckle. \u201cIt sounds nicer.\u201d\n\nThe final product looks like light brown flour and smells faintly like Marmite. It packs a serious nutritional punch \u2014 around 60% raw protein, plus a mix of fibre, amino acids, and other nutrients.\n\nMicroHarvest\u2019s powder joins a crowded buffet of alt-protein options \u2014 think lab-grown chicken, algae nuggets, pea patties, and mycoprotein steaks. But Bekers is convinced that microbes earn their spot on the plate.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re producing is much more efficient than plant or animal-based proteins,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need acres of land or gallons of water. Our microbes grow in days, not months or years, and they convert feed into protein with incredible efficiency.\u201d\n\nMicroHarvest\u2019s fermentation process takes less than 24 hours \u2014 lightning fast compared to growing soy or raising cows. It is estimated to slash land use by 99% and cuts CO2 emissions by over 70% compared to beef.\n\nA 2022 study in Nature found that replacing just 20% of global beef consumption with microbial proteins could cut annual deforestation in half by 2050. Plus, bioreactors like MicroHarvest\u2019s could be deployed pretty much anywhere there\u2019s a significant agricultural industry.\n\nOf course, the idea of eating dried bacteria might raise a few eyebrows \u2014 or stomachs. But Bekers is quick to draw comparisons to foods we already know and love.\n\n\u201cThese are similar to the microbes you find in things like yoghurt, kimchi, or sauerkraut,\u201d she says. \u201cFood is a cultural phenomenon, and we get that. We\u2019re not trying to replace your steak or convert everyone to veganism. We\u2019re just adding another protein to the menu.\u201d\n\nMicroHarvest is one of Europe\u2019s best-known microbial protein producers, but the scene is bubbling with competition. Startups across the continent and beyond are experimenting with different microbes and feedstocks \u2014 from Germany\u2019s Formo making alt dairy to the UK\u2019s Enough turning fungi into meat.\n\nMeanwhile, corporate giants like Nestl\u00e9 and Unilever are testing the waters through partnerships and pilot launches.\n\nGlobally, almost $1bn (\u20ac874mn) flowed into fermentation-based alt-protein startups last year, according to Dealroom data. Europe attracted nearly half of that, with 2024 marking the sector\u2019s highest funding year ever on the continent.\n\nAlongside that, the EU unveiled a new \u20ac350mn funding strategy in July to accelerate the scale-up of fermentation tech, as the continent seeks to tackle its deep-rooted addiction to meat.\n\nEven replacing a portion of our protein consumption with a fermented alternative is a compelling proposition. It could significantly reduce the land and water needed for farming while slashing carbon emissions. But the transition is not without its challenges.\n\nSwapping steak for microbes isn\u2019t as easy as simply building more bioreactors. Fermented proteins currently face high production costs and a battle to win over sceptical consumers, whose opinions on food choices often become embroiled in culture wars.\n\nThen there\u2019s the regulatory red tape. It\u2019s unclear when \u2014 or even if \u2014 MicroHarvest will get the green light for human consumption. The lengthy approval process for alt-protein products has bogged down other startups in the space. One example is Dutch cultivated meat brand Meatable, which has spent years navigating the regulatory hurdles. Founded in 2018, the company is still awaiting approval to sell its products commercially. It\u2019s now focusing on Singapore, where lawmakers have been more welcoming to alt-proteins than their counterparts in Europe.\n\nMicroHarvest nonetheless remains optimistic. The startup has already submitted a full dossier to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) seeking regulatory approval for human consumption of its fermented protein.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really confident we\u2019ll get it,\u201d says Bekers. \u201cWe screened the full DNA of the strain, checked for any harmful potential, and submitted a very complete dossier.\u201d\n\nFor now, MicroHarvest plans to scale through another customer segment: pets. Last year, MicroHarvest teamed up with Munich-based startup VegDog to launch its first commercial product \u2014 a vegan dog treat made with microbial protein.\n\nAnimal nutrition has fewer regulatory barriers than products for human consumption. The availability of conventional pet food and fish feed also falls short of current demand.\n\n\u201cThe pet and aquaculture industries are growing rapidly, but the supply of feed is not,\u201d says Bekers, adding that pet food and fish feed already offer a strong path to profitability, even without the human market.\n\nMicroHarvest is now seeking Series B funding to open a new plant in 2027, with a planned capacity of 15,000 tonnes of product per year \u2014 40 times its current output.\n\nBekers is tight-lipped on the location, but her fellow co-founder, Lu\u00edsa Cruz, was eager to point out the benefits of doing business in her native Portugal.\n\n\u201cIf you want to operate a biotechnology company, Portugal is a great place to do it,\u201d says Cruz, who earned her PhD in biotechnology at TU Delft in the Netherlands.\n\n\u201cIt has great universities for biotechnology and a lot of talent, which is why we decided to open our first plant here.\u201d\n\nBacked by record private investment and fresh EU funding, fermentation-based proteins like MicroHarvest\u2019s are bubbling with promise. But turning dead bacteria from pet snacks into mainstream meals won\u2019t be easy.\n\nThe next few years will reveal if these microbial powders are a fleeting fad or the future of food. I\u2019m sure cows will be silently betting on the latter outcome.",

      "text": "Dutch startup Meatable has hosted the first legally approved tasting of cultivated meat in Europe.\nOn the menu was a lab-grown pork sausage. Meatable says the produce is \u201cindistinguishable\u201d from traditional meat, but causes no harm to animals or the environment.\nTo replicate the flavours and textures of livestock, Meatable first extracts a single cell sample from a pig. The sample is then cultivated in a bioreactor. Over time, the sample multiplies and forms real muscle tissue, which is shaped into a familiar meat form.\nIn Europe, however, no one was previously allowed to eat the output. That changed when the Dutch government gave Meatable the rubber stamp.\nThe inaugural tasting took place at the company\u2019s headquarters in Leiden. Among the diners were Dutch prince Constantijn van Oranje, Michelin-starred chef Ron Blaauw, and entrepreneur Ira van Eelen, whose father Willem filed the first patent for cultivated meat.\nTheir reaction \u201cwas really positive,\u201d said Meatable co-founder and CTO Krijn de Nood.\n\u201cWe will be liaising with the tasters from today to understand their feedback,\u201d he told TNW.\nThat feedback will inform the future product development. It will also contribute to Meatable\u2019s application to sell the sausages in the EU. But the first target market is Singapore.\nThe cultivated meat market\nMeatable plans to launch its pork products next year in Singapore. The country wants cultivated meat to reduce its reliance on imports, which comprise 90% of its current food supplies. In 2020, the city-state issued the world\u2019s first approval for sales of lab-grown meat.\nThe next target for Meatable is the US, which last year became the second country to permit the sales.\nEurope has been slower to embrace the produce. But the event in Leiden suggests support for cultivated meat is growing.\nAccording to de Nood, the tasting was \u201can important first step\u201d towards the market. But did the flavours live up to the hype?\n\u201cIt tasted just like meaty sausages do!\u201d de Nood said.\nIf all goes to plan, those sausages could be a mere entree on the menu. A German startup wants to offer lab-grown fish as a main course. We can only imagine what\u2019s cultivating for dessert.\nGet the TNW newsletter\nGet the most important tech news in your inbox each week."

      "text": "Europe is home to some of the world\u2019s most innovative food companies creating alternative proteins, but many are choosing to launch their products first in the US or Singapore\nIf all goes to plan, Dutch start-up Meatable will launch its cultivated meat in the first half of this year.\nMeatable is one of Europe\u2019s leaders of cultivating animal cells to generate meat, using fermenters similar to those used in brewing beer, but European consumers won\u2019t find it on the shelves of their local supermarket any time soon.\nLike many European novel food companies, Meatable is planning to launch in Singapore, where the approval process is quicker and more efficient. It is then looking to expand to the US, before opening to other regions from 2026.\nThe company is working with European regulators, but \u201cit is a long and complex process to submit for novel food approval in Europe,\u201d a Meatable spokesman said. It generally takes around three years.\nSingapore was the first country in the world to approve the sale of factory cultivated meat to consumers in December 2020, followed by the US in June 2023.\nIsrael-based Aleph Farms has applied for approval for its cultivated beef in the UK and Switzerland, after being granted approval in Israel, but there are currently no cultivated meat applications under consideration in the EU.\nA major difference in Singapore is that companies are given regular guidance while compiling their applications, said Christian Poppe, director of public affairs at Formo, a Germany-based start-up which uses precision fermentation to create cheese and egg alternatives in microbial cell culture.\n\u201cYou know that when you finally submit, the chances of you having included all relevant safety data are pretty high,\u201d he said.\nIt is not a case of lower standards, Poppe insists. \u201cThey are pretty much the same, because when they drafted their legislation, they specifically looked at European standards.\u201d\nHuge asset\nPoppe is also a spokesman for Food Fermentation Europe (FFE), an industry alliance launched in 2023 by five fermentation companies, including Formo, to advocate for a more innovation-friendly policy framework.\nEurope\u2019s rigorous novel food standards are a \u201chuge asset\u201d, and the industry benefits from the trust they inspire in consumers, Poppe said. \u201cWe\u2019re all in favour of upholding these standards.\u201d\nThis was a common refrain from every industry member who spoke to Science|Business.\nPoppe also says the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is \u201csuper curious and keen to dig into these new technologies\u201d. The problem is the agency is \u201cmassively understaffed\u201d, meaning the application and review process takes longer than it needs to.\nFFE is calling on the European Commission to give EFSA more resources, and for companies to receive more guidance before submitting their dossiers.\n\u201cWhat we hear from start-ups and SMEs is that there's a very clear pathway for the risk assessment and a path to market in other jurisdictions, and in the EU, that timeline is longer and much more variable, which makes investments complicated,\u201d said Lucie McMurtry, industrial biotechnology manager at the industry body EuropaBio.\nAn EFSA spokesman said the agency does offer pre-submission advice and is \u201cin constant dialogue with stakeholders\u201d to ensure requirements are clear.\nOnce it receives an application, it has a fixed legal deadline of nine months in which to complete a risk assessment, but it may stop the clock if further data or clarifications are necessary.\nSince novel food regulations were updated in 2018, EFSA has received almost 300 applications, more than from 2002 to 2018. \u201cThe rise in workload at EFSA in this area has also been matched by a rise in the number of staff working on novel foods,\u201d the spokesman said.\nBut more communication about how applicants can access advice is needed, said Kari Tronsmo, open innovation manager at the French multinational food company Danone. There should be more support so that applicants do the right analysis, and do not overspend gathering irrelevant information.\nHowever, once a product is approved in Europe, \u201cit\u2019s kind of a golden pass for the rest of the world,\u201d she said. \u201cThe process is so solid, if you\u2019ve gone through it, then you will very easily get approval in other regions as well, so it really is a worthwhile investment.\u201d\nOnce EFSA has conducted its risk assessment, there is a risk management stage in which the European Commission considers EFSA\u2019s opinion alongside other factors.\nThe final decision comes down to the Commission and a committee of representatives from all 27 member states. This represents an additional hurdle since the negotiations can become political, rather than purely technical, and often lack transparency.\nVivici, a Dutch start-up specialised in the precision fermentation of dairy proteins, is currently preparing to launch in the US. It is weeks away from declaring self-affirmed Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status, showing that the ingredient and processes are safe based on the conclusions of an expert panel. This will allow it to market its ingredient immediately while the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluates the information.\nBy comparison, the process in Europe could be \u201cclearer, more predictable, and faster\u201d, says Vivici CEO Stephan van Sint Fiet.\n\u201cThere is dialogue between EFSA and the industry to improve upon these things,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a consumer, I do not want EFSA to cut corners.\u201d\nRisk of relocation\nVan Sint Fiet believes it is \u201cperfectly possible to operate as a European company in Europe, while not actually marketing your ingredient for the time being in Europe\u201d.\nAfter all, when it comes to sustainability, \u201cEvery tonne of sustainably produced protein is a win, it doesn't matter where it goes.\u201d\nThere is however a risk that if the investment climate and the regulatory environment are unfavourable, companies will relocate their headquarters. \u201cUnfortunately, you've seen many innovative, European biotech companies do exactly that in the past,\u201d van Sint Fiet said.\nThe US is actively trying to convince European companies to relocate. Poppe says representatives of the US National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology have been visiting companies, including Formo, to learn what favourable policy frameworks would make the US even more appealing to them.\nThe birthplace of cultivated meat\nIf Europe falls behind other parts of the world, it won\u2019t be for want of expertise. \u201cWe have a long biotech and fermentation history that has created a lot of very specific knowhow,\u201d said van Sint Fiet. He cites companies such as Carlsberg which have pushed innovation in yeast fermentation.\n\u201cEurope is the birthplace of cultivated meat and is home to half of the world\u2019s top 10 universities, so it should be a global leader in alternative proteins,\u201d said Seth Roberts, policy manager at the international nonprofit and thinktank the Good Food Institute Europe (GFI).\nBut Europe could fall behind without meaningful public investment and a clear strategy, he said. Instruments such as Horizon Europe should be used to \u201chelp scale up and commercialise cultivated meat and precision fermentation\u201d.\nHorizon Europe has already committed \u20ac25 million to sustainable proteins research, while the Circular Bio-based Europe joint undertaking also supports research into alternative proteins. This covers not just novel foods but also other sources of protein such as algae and insects.\nThe Commission was due to propose a sustainable food systems law, as well as a new protein strategy, early this year, but these are no longer expected before the European elections and do not feature in the 2024 work programme.\nThe Commission will however present a biotech and biomanufacturing initiative, which \u201chas the potential to strengthen the connection between biomanufacturing and the food sector and could position Europe as a driving force in alternative proteins,\u201d said Roberts.\nEuropaBio is also eagerly awaiting that initiative, as well as changes to the EU\u2019s taxonomy regulation, which defines investments which are considered sustainable. The list of sustainable activities is gradually being updated and should eventually include criteria for food production.\n\u201cIf novel foods are seen as substantially contributing to the environmental objectives of the taxonomy regulation, then that would boost investment into those sectors,\u201d said McMurtry.\nItalian ban\nNational governments are sending mixed signals. The Netherlands, for example, has been a pioneer in investing in alternative proteins, and recently became the first EU country to allow cultivated meat tastings prior to approval.\nFor start-ups in particular, this will allow them to refine their product, and to demonstrate to investors that there will be a consumer market and to raise funds to scale up.\nIn November 2023, Italy voted to ban cultivated meat altogether. Last week, the European Commission informed Italy that it had breached EU law since it did not give member states and the Commission sufficient notice to comment on potential barriers to the internal market. The future of the ban is now uncertain.\nThe Italian government fears synthetic meats pose a threat to Italian culture and tradition, a claim which McMurtry rejects. \u201cWe need to sustainably diversify our food systems, and so we need all possible solutions, including the traditional ones,\u201d she said.\nA lack of infrastructure is another barrier. There are some facilities, such as the Bio Base Europe Pilot Plant in Belgium, and Extracellular\u2019s recently inaugurated contract pilot facility in Bristol, UK, which will offer companies access to facilities and expertise.\n\u201cIf Europe is to compete with other regions, we need governments and businesses to invest in more of these facilities,\u201d said Roberts.\nPoppe agrees policymakers \u201cneed to recognise the potentials of biotechnology\u201d and provide greater subsidies for the creation of competitive European infrastructure.\nIn a recent report, a European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) think tank called for more public investment in R&D and infrastructure, and a Horizon Europe partnership on protein diversification.\nAlternative proteins offer significant environmental advantages. Cultivated meat promises a 92% reduction in greenhouse gases, and uses 95% less land, and 78% less water than conventional beef, according to a life cycle assessment from consultancy CE Delft.\nAs well as the approval process, advocates for alternative proteins are calling for changes to labelling requirements. For example, in Europe, Formo would not be able to refer to its products as \u201ccreamy\u201d or \u201canimal-free dairy\u201d.\n\u201cWe are far away from being able to call our product something that helps consumers understand what they have in front of them,\u201d Poppe said."

      "text": "Abstract\nRuminant meat provides valuable protein to humans, but livestock production has many negative environmental impacts, especially in terms of deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, water use and eutrophication1. In addition to a dietary shift towards plant-based diets2, imitation products, including plant-based meat, cultured meat and fermentation-derived microbial protein (MP), have been proposed as means to reduce the externalities of livestock production3,4,5,6,7. Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have estimated substantial environmental benefits of MP, produced in bioreactors using sugar as feedstock, especially compared to ruminant meat3,7. Here we present an analysis of MP as substitute for ruminant meat in forward-looking global land-use scenarios towards 2050. Our study complements LCA studies by estimating the environmental benefits of MP within a future socio-economic pathway. Our model projections show that substituting 20% of per-capita ruminant meat consumption with MP globally by 2050 (on a protein basis) offsets future increases in global pasture area, cutting annual deforestation and related CO2 emissions roughly in half, while also lowering methane emissions. However, further upscaling of MP, under the assumption of given consumer acceptance, results in a non-linear saturation effect on reduced deforestation and related CO2 emissions\u2014an effect that cannot be captured with the method of static LCA.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nMain\nGlobal total livestock production has strongly increased in the last decades; in particular, the production of ruminant meat has more than doubled since 1961 (ref. 8). Current livestock production systems, especially ruminant-based farming systems, have substantial environmental consequences in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use, terrestrial acidification, eutrophication and freshwater withdrawals1. The global food system is responsible for one-third of the global anthropogenic GHG emissions, with livestock production being a major contributor in particular because of methane (CH4) emissions from the digestive processes (enteric fermentation) of ruminants9,10. Land use for livestock production is particularly high, accounting for 80% of global agricultural land if pasture land for grazing and cropland for animal feed production are considered11,12. Moreover, it is estimated that the production of livestock feed accounts for 41% of total agricultural water use, with ruminant meat production being the single largest water consumer13. Further increases of livestock production are projected for the coming decades, specifically in present middle-income countries, driven by population growth and dietary shifts towards animal-based products due to increasing average individual incomes14,15.\nA gradual shift towards diets with less animal-farmed protein, in particular ruminant meat, in favour of plant-based protein sources, as suggested by the flexitarian diet of the EAT-Lancet Commission, would be healthier for people and more sustainable for the planet2,16. Adoption of the EAT-Lancet planetary health diet in high-income nations alone could yield a substantial double climate dividend due to GHG emission reduction and carbon sequestration17. However, the question is how such a fundamental behavioural transformation could be achieved at globally relevant scales, considering that key barriers for the substitution of meat with plant-based protein sources include the sensory experience of eating meat, the taste and subjective concerns about the risk of protein deficiency18.\nAlternative protein sources\nAn alternative to largely plant-based diets is to substitute meat by analogues that mimic the taste and texture of animal-farmed products19. Meat analogues can be broadly categorized into three groups: plant-based meat substitutes (for example, soybean burger patties), cultured meat (animal cells cultured in growth medium) and fermentation-derived microbial protein (MP) (microbial biomass produced in bioreactors, also known as single-cell protein)5,7,20. Plant-based meat analogues primarily rely on agricultural crops (for example, soybean) grown on cropland (roughly comparable to plant-based diets). By contrast, commercially available MP for human consumption (mycoprotein), is derived from fungal mycelium cultivated in heated bioreactors using sugar as feedstock6,21. The fermentation process largely decouples the production of edible MP from local biophysical conditions, which might become especially relevant under climate change. However, cropland is still needed for growing sugar crops21. Edible MP produced by methanotrophic or hydrogen-oxidizing chemosynthetic bacteria, which rely on methane or hydrogen and CO2 instead of sugar as energy source, is currently under development and not yet commercially feasible22,23. In a similar fashion, the cultivation of animal cells in a growth medium to produce cultured meat could be largely decoupled from traditional agriculture5. However, cultured meat is still in an early development stage with many unknowns, particularly with regard to the composition and costs of the growth medium7. In this study, we focus on sugar-based MP produced via biological fermentation, which is available commercially today in grocery stores in multiple countries. Biological fermentation has been applied at industrial scale for the production of mycoprotein since the 1980s4,24. Mycoprotein is microbial biomass with meat-like texture and high protein content4,6. The protein quality of mycoprotein, measured by essential amino acid content and digestibility, is equivalent to ruminant meat6,24. Moreover, mycoprotein has been generally recognized as safe by the US Food and Drug Administration since 2002 (refs. 4,25).\nThe environmental benefits and trade-offs of mycoprotein have been analysed in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies, suggesting substantially lower GHG emissions (approximately 80%), water use (>90%) and land use (>90%) for each unit of ruminant meat substituted with mycoprotein3,7. However, LCA studies also indicate that the replacement of other livestock products such as pork and chicken with mycoprotein would not result in substantial environmental benefits7,25,26. However, many effects of large-scale substitution of animal-farmed products are likely to be non-linear and cannot be scaled up on the basis of static LCA footprints of current production systems. The substitution of livestock products with fermentation-derived analogues has not been studied so far in a dynamic system model accounting for future population growth, food demand, land-use dynamics, agricultural intensification or international trade. Only a single study estimated the total global land savings of alternative protein sources on the basis of population and food production systems of the year 2011, without quantifying the associated GHG emissions and environmental impacts27.\nFuture scenarios of sugar-based MP\nIn this study, we analysed the environmental effects of partially substituting ruminant meat with sugar-based MP in global forward-looking scenarios between 2020 and 2050. In line with previous studies, we assumed that biological fermentation for single-cell protein production requires sugar cane grown on cropland as feedstock (Methods)28,29. We limited the substitution of livestock products to ruminant meat, for which previous LCA studies estimated the largest environmental benefits (in contrast to pork and chicken)7. To this end, we used the global multiregional Model of Agricultural Production and its Impact on the Environment (MAgPIE) 4 open-source land-use modelling framework30,31. The MAgPIE framework has been used earlier to study the impacts of replacing animal feed with MP. We built on this previous research and used the middle-of-the-road shared socio-economic pathway (SSP2) scenario, which features increasing population, income and livestock demand (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2), as our reference scenario (SSP2-Ref-MP0)15,28. In three alternative scenarios, we assumed that 20% (MP20), 50% (MP50) and 80% (MP80) of the per-capita protein consumption from ruminant meat is replaced with sugar-based MP in each model region by 2050 (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 2). To mimic the typical adoption of new technologies and products by consumers, the fade-in of MP follows an S-shaped curve from 2020 onwards, reaching the target in 2050. The scenario-specific per-capita consumption of ruminant meat and MP is multiplied with the corresponding population to obtain total demand, which is used as the driver in the model (Fig. 1b). In summary, all scenarios are driven by the same overall demand for food crops, feed, livestock products and bioenergy but differ in the substitution targets of ruminant meat with MP (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 2\u20134).\nLand-use dynamics\nLand-use change, as projected by the MAgPIE model, differs substantially between the reference and MP scenarios. In the reference scenario (MP0), cropland and pasture both increase at the cost of forest and non-forest vegetation between 2020 and 2050 at the global level (Fig. 2). The increase of cropland (175 Mha) and pasture (96 Mha) by 2050 is driven by SSP2-based demand for food crops, feed and livestock products (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 4). The global loss of forest (178 Mha) and non-forest vegetation (92 Mha) by 2050 is largely driven by demand from sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America (Extended Data Fig. 7). In the MP20 scenario, global loss of forest between 2020 and 2050 is much lower (78 Mha), largely because pasture area, in contrast to the reference scenario, does not expand. At the same time, the increase in global cropland by 2050 is similar in both scenarios. The reason for the pasture dynamic is that the 20% per-capita substitution of ruminant meat with MP by 2050 results in rather static total global ruminant meat demand from 2025 onwards (Fig. 1b), which (notably) is sufficient to largely offset future increases of overall pasture feed demand at the global level (Fig. 1c). For cropland, mainly two counteracting processes cancel out each other in MP20: crop-based feed demand for ruminant meat production is reduced, while sugar cane demand as feedstock for MP fermentation is increased (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 5).\nHigher substitution targets of ruminant meat with MP in the MP50 and MP80 scenarios enhance the land saving effects observed for the MP20 scenario. Further reductions of pasture-based feed demand (Fig. 1c) result in declining global pasture area between 2020 and 2050 (Fig. 2). Thus, cropland increasingly expands into those freed up pasture areas, saving forest and non-forest vegetation from conversion. In the MP80 scenario, there is almost no loss of forest and non-forest vegetation between 2020 and 2050 at the global level (Fig. 2). In comparison to the reference scenario, deforestation and loss of non-forest vegetation is especially reduced in the Congo Basin, Central America and the Amazon Basin (Supplementary Fig. 5).\nNon-linear substitution effects\nThe substitution of ruminant meat with MP reduces several food-related environmental pressures, which can be mapped to sustainable development goals (SDGs). SDGs are aspirational goals with global coverage towards 2030. In this study, we used the following set of environmental indicators, partly adapted from a recent study on SDGs in which MAgPIE was contributing in a multi-model framework approach2: deforestation (SDG15: life on land), carbon dioxide (CO2), CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agriculture and land-use change (SDG13: climate action), agricultural water use (SDG06: clean water and sanitation) and nitrogen fixation (SDG15). For consistency and for the analysis of relative effects, all environmental indicators reflect annual values. As the scope of MAgPIE is limited to agriculture and land use, we did not account for energy requirements and energy-related GHG emissions of MP production in this study (see Discussion for the implications).\nIn the reference scenario, global annual deforestation increases from 3.7 Mha year\u22121 in 2020 to 4.8 Mha year\u22121 in 2030 and 8.4 Mha year\u22121 in 2050 (Fig. 3a), mainly driven by forest-to-pasture conversion for animal grazing in sub-Saharan Africa (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 7). In the MP20 scenario, these global annual deforestation rates are roughly halved, resulting in 3.7 Mha year\u22121 in 2050. A further increase of ruminant meat substitution to 50% by 2050 (MP50) again roughly halves global annual deforestation, resulting in 1.5 Mha year\u22121 in 2050. The same trend continues in the MP80 scenario, resulting in 0.6 Mha year\u22121 in 2050. Hence, the substitution of ruminant meat with MP supports the achievement of SDG target 15.2 of halting deforestation.\nOur results show a non-linear relationship between different levels of ruminant meat substitution and annual deforestation (Fig. 3g). The reason for the non-linear relationship is that land-use change typically does not depend on the level of production but on structural change in agricultural production. In the absence of land degradation, changes in land management or any other disturbing effects, no additional cropland or pasture is needed to maintain agricultural production at the same level. However, to increase the production more land and/or higher yields are needed. Likewise, a reduction of land-based production could decrease managed land or reduce land-use intensity. In our scenarios, the substitution of ruminant meat with MP strongly reduces the demand for animal feed from pastures. In the MP20 scenario, global feed demand from pasture is rather constant from 2020 onwards, in contrast to an increasing trend in the reference scenario (Fig. 1c). Therefore, no increase of global pasture area is needed in MP20 by 2050, which explains the strong reduction of deforestation relative to the reference scenario (56%). However, the forest-saving effect saturates with higher substitution targets in MP50 (82%) and MP80 (93%), in which the global pasture feed demand decreases compared to the reference scenario (Fig. 1c).\nCO2 emissions from land-use change are strongly driven by changes in forest cover and hence follow the same non-linear pattern as observed for annual deforestation (Fig. 3b). The CO2 emissions reported in this study reflect net CO2 emissions as they account for carbon losses through deforestation and conversion of non-forest vegetation as well as for carbon gains from afforestation and regrowth of vegetation on abandoned agricultural land. In the reference scenario, global net CO2 emissions from land-use change decrease from 3,957 Mt CO2 year\u22121 in 2020 to 3,048 Mt CO2 yr\u22121 in 2030, followed by an increase to 5,496 Mt CO2 year\u22121 in 2050. The global increase of net CO2 emissions is largely driven by two counteracting regional dynamics. From 2020 onwards, CO2 emissions in Latin America decline but strongly increase in sub-Saharan Africa, both driven by differing socio-economic developments in terms of population and food demand (especially for ruminant meat; see the supplementary information for the regional details). In the MP20 scenario, net CO2 emissions amount to 2,392 Mt CO2 year\u22121 in 2050, which correspond to a relative reduction of 56% compared to the reference scenario (Fig. 3g). In line with the non-linear relationship for deforestation, the reduction of net CO2 emissions from land-use change shrinks with higher substitution targets. In MP50 and MP80, net CO2 emissions amount to 951 and 734 Mt CO2 year\u22121 in 2050, respectively. These levels correspond to relative reductions of 83% and 87% for MP50 and MP80, respectively. Hence, the substitution of ruminant meat with MP could strongly reduce net CO2 emissions from land-use change. Such emission reductions can be considered to support the targets of SDG13, although there are no quantitative targets for sectoral emission reductions.\nLinear substitution effects\nThe substitution of ruminant meat with MP also reduces CH4 and N2O emissions from agriculture (SDG13), agricultural water use (SDG06) and nitrogen fixation (SDG15) (Fig. 3c\u2013f). In contrast to land-use change and associated net CO2 emissions, these indicators largely depend on the level of production. Hence, each unit of ruminant meat replaced with MP yields about the same reduction of environmental pressures, indicating a rather linear relationship (Fig. 3g).\nAgricultural CH4 emissions, which are largely caused by enteric fermentation in the rumen of cattle (belching), increase in the reference scenario from 208 to 282 Mt CH4 year\u22121 between 2020 and 2050 at the global scale. The reduced number of cattle in the MP scenarios results in lower CH4 emissions, which amount to 250, 210 and 172 Mt CH4 year\u22121 in 2050 for MP20, MP50 and MP80, respectively. In relative terms, these numbers reflect reductions of 11, 26 and 39% by 2050 compared to the reference scenario. Similarly, N2O emissions from agricultural soils (fertilizer application) and animal waste management, increase in the reference scenario from 9.5 to 13.4 Mt N2O year\u22121 between 2020 and 2050. The reduced number of cattle in the MP scenarios lowers the increase of global N2O emissions to 10\u201312.4 Mt N2O year\u22121 by 2050, which corresponds to relative reductions of 7\u201325%. Hence, the substitution of ruminant meat with MP has distinct effects on CH4 and N2O emissions from agriculture. At the regional level, sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Asia show the strongest reductions of CH4 and N2O emissions, which is largely driven by the scale of total ruminant meat substituted with MP (Extended Data Figs. 3 and 9).\nThe effects of ruminant meat substitution on agricultural water use (SDG06) and nitrogen fixation (SDG15) are rather small. Global agricultural water use for food and feed crops increases in the reference scenario from 3,057 to 4,200 km3 year\u22121 between 2020 and 2050. Reduced demand for animal feed crops in the MP scenarios limits the increase of agricultural water use to 3,868\u20134,137 km3 year\u22121 by 2050, which corresponds to relative reductions of 1\u20138%. However, this will likely not be sufficient to achieve SDG target 6.4 (sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater) as already today water withdrawals in many parts of the world tap into environmental flow requirements32. Similarly, nitrogen fixation, a proxy for nitrogen losses to the environment and hence ecosystem degradation, increases from 172 to 234 Mt N year\u22121 between 2020 and 2050 in the reference scenario. Reduced demand for animal feed crops in the MP scenarios limits the increase of nitrogen fixation to 212\u2013227 Mt N year\u22121 by 2050, which corresponds to relative reductions of 3\u20139%. However, these levels are substantially above the target value of 90 Mt N year\u22121 for SDG 15.5 (ref. 2).\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we present the first analysis of substituting ruminant meat with sugar-based MP in forward-looking land-use scenarios. For our model-based projections with global coverage until 2050, we used the spatially explicit land-use model MAgPIE. Our scenarios are based on SSP2, a middle-of-the-road scenario for future population, income and food demand. We quantified the environmental benefits of substituting 20, 50 and 80% of per-capita ruminant meat consumption with MP by 2050 in each model region. Notably, the reduced animal feed demand in the 20% case (MP20) is sufficient to offset future increases of global pasture area, which translates into 56% less deforestation and 56% less net CO2 emissions from land-use change by 2050, both compared to the reference scenario. In the 50 and 80% case, deforestation is further reduced, resulting in relative reductions of 82 and 93% by 2050, respectively. Similarly, net CO2 emissions from land-use change are reduced by 83 and 87% in the 50 and 80% case, respectively. The reason for this non-linear substitution effect is that land-use change, and hence net CO2 emissions, depend on structural change in agricultural production, as opposed to the level of production. The substitution of ruminant meat with MP also reduces non-CO2 emissions from agriculture, agricultural water use and nitrogen fixation. However, these environmental indicators largely depend on the level of production, and hence decrease rather linearly with increasing substitution targets. In particular, global agricultural CH4 emissions are reduced by 11, 26 and 39% at per-capita substitution targets of 20, 50 and 80% by 2050, respectively.\nPrevious LCA studies estimated substantial environmental benefits of MP derived from fungal mycelium (mycoprotein) over ruminant meat at the product level3,7. In this study, we assessed the consequences of large-scale substitution of ruminant meat with sugar-based MP in global forward-looking scenarios on a set of environmental indicators. Owing to methodological differences, our results cannot be compared directly to existing LCA outcomes. However, our results complement existing LCA studies on the substitution of ruminant meat with MP. First, our study provides an estimate of the absolute and relative reductions of food-related environmental pressures for different substitution targets until 2050, globally and for 12 geopolitical regions. Second, our study shows that the large-scale upscaling of MP as substitute for ruminant meat results in a non-linear saturation effect on land-use change and associated net CO2 emissions\u2014an effect that cannot be captured with the method of static LCA. Similarly, environmental pressures are context-dependent and are not reduced equally around the globe, depending on the development of socio-economic factors such as population dynamics, diet patterns and international trade. This underpins the importance of using a dynamic system model rather than static LCA for estimating the environmental benefits of MP as substitute for ruminant meat.\nAt the same time, the use of forward-looking modelling tools for analysing the substitution of ruminant meat with MP suggests that the quantified environmental benefits depend on scenario assumptions. In this study, we analysed the substitution of ruminant meat with MP in the context of an SSP2-based scenario broadly characterized by the continuation of current demographic, environmental, technological and societal trends into the future33. However, our results would likely differ under a more sustainable setting such as SSP1 (sustainable development), which is characterized by slower population growth, increased environmental awareness and reduced consumption of livestock products33. Under this setting some environmental benefits of replacing ruminant meat with MP are likely smaller because of (1) overall lower pressure on the land (lower population and dietary change) and (2) improved regulation of externalities such as deforestation. This could especially affect the two indicators for which we identified non-linear substitution effects\u2014deforestation and associated net CO2 emissions\u2014both of which depend on structural change in agricultural production. For instance, global forest cover is estimated to be rather constant throughout the 21st century under an SSP1 setting (SSP1-NDC), in contrast to declining forest cover under a comparable SSP2 setting (SSP2-NDC)2. Hence, the relative reduction of deforestation and net CO2 emissions attributable to the substitution of ruminant meat with MP is likely smaller under SSP1 compared to SSP2. On the contrary, the environmental benefits of substituting ruminant meat with MP might be stronger under a more pessimistic background setting such as SSP3 (regional rivalry), which is characterized by high population growth in low-income countries, low priority for addressing environmental problems and resource-intensive diets33. However, the use of biotechnology for solving environmental problems is inconsistent with the overall SSP3 narrative.\nFurther factors influencing the scenario set-up and thus the outcome include assumptions about land-based climate change mitigation measures (for example, bioenergy, forest protection and afforestation) and climate change impacts on land (for example, crop yields and carbon stocks in ecosystems). In this study, we deliberately focused on analysing the basic effects of substituting ruminant meat with MP under an SSP2 reference scenario without further assumptions on land-based mitigation and climate change impacts. We did, however, account for existing national polices on forest protection, afforestation and bioenergy (Supplementary Fig. 3). In addition to climate protection measures, future national policies in support of the transition towards a bioeconomy might increase the demand for biomass grown on agricultural land. In our results, the substitution of ruminant meat with MP reduces deforestation through increased pasture-to-cropland conversion. Alternatively, pasture areas no longer needed for livestock grazing could be partly repurposed to biomass cultivation. However, depending on the scale, the production of additional biomass might offset the environmental benefits of MP, especially with regard to deforestation and associated net CO2 emissions. To avoid such trade-offs, policies promoting biomass cultivation should be complemented by forest protection policies34.\nOur study is limited to the replacement of ruminant meat with sugar-based MP that is currently commercially available for human consumption (mycoprotein)4. Edible MP produced by methanotrophic or hydrogen-oxidizing chemosynthetic bacteria (power to food) is an emerging technology that, in contrast to mycoprotein, does not rely on biomass as an energy source22,23. Therefore, the land-use requirement of power to food is considerably smaller compared to mycoprotein22, unless the hydrogen or methane itself is being produced using biomass28. The climate impacts of MP produced via power to food are estimated to be lower compared to mycoprotein but strongly depend on the use of low-emission energy sources22,23. Cultured meat is another technology that might play an important role in replacing animal-sourced protein in the future5,7,20. LCA studies indicate that cultured meat production might require smaller quantities of agricultural inputs and land than ruminant meat production26,35,36. However, those benefits could come at the cost of higher energy requirements, which might undermine the GHG emission savings of cultured meat production, depending on the availability of decarbonized energy generation35,37. Precision fermentation is a further future technology relevant to the alternative protein space, which could be utilized to produce milk protein (as ingredient for dairy analogues) or egg white38,39. However, at the time of writing, no public data for inclusion in our modelling framework on land-based feedstock requirements of cultured meat and precision fermentation were available. Nevertheless, our results for the substitution of ruminant meat with MP can be interpreted as a proxy for the large-scale substitution of ruminant meat or dairy products with other biotechnology-enabled alternatives such as cultured meat or fermentation-based milk analogues.\nOur study covers several environmental indicators, including deforestation, GHG emissions from agriculture and land-use change, agricultural water use and nitrogen losses. However, we do not account for the environmental consequences of sugar-based MP production beyond the land-use sector. Especially, our modelling framework is not capable of tracking the energy requirements and energy-related GHG emissions of MP production, which is of key importance for assessing the sustainability of MP production. On the basis of LCA studies, it has been estimated that mycoprotein production has about the same energy requirements as conventional ruminant meat production7. However, this proxy should be interpreted with care because the energy requirements for mycoprotein and ruminant meat production have been calculated with different methods26,35. Moreover, the type of energy needed for MP and ruminant meat production differs. For ruminant meat, animal feed production is a major energy consumer (for example, diesel for tractors and natural gas for synthetic nitrogen fertilizer production)35. By contrast, in cell-cultured food production the whole idea is that bioreactors replace animals6,20. Instead of feeding animals, the feedstock is processed in bioreactors, which use electricity to regulate the temperature and other functions of the bioreactor. Therefore, the land-related GHG emission savings of sugar-based MP shown in our study need to be contrasted with energy-related GHG emissions for assessing the net effect. To avoid that GHG emission savings in the land-use sector are offset or even exceeded by GHG emissions from the energy sector, a large-scale transformation towards cell-cultured food, as assumed in our scenarios, would need to be complemented by a large-scale decarbonization of electricity generation. It is anticipated that recent technological advancements and cost reductions in solar photovoltaics, wind and battery storage could make renewable energy cost-competitive compared to carbon-based fuels in the near future and that considerably higher electrification shares across different sectors are possible40.\nMoreover, if MP were to replace ruminant meat at large-scale, as assumed in our scenarios, this transformation would likely reduce the provision of non-food animal by-products such as hides and skins for leather products, organs for pet food, fat for chemicals, bones and blood for fertilizers as well as non-food services from animal husbandry such as traction and insurance, the latter being especially relevant in low-income countries41. These non-food by-products, which are often by-products of meat production, would need to be replaced by alternatives such as synthetic leather, synthetic fertilizer or plant-based fats, causing additional GHG emissions and other environmental impacts that are not considered in our assessment. Partly, non-food by-products could be replaced in the future by fermentation-enabled alternatives such as fungi-based leather42. However, in analogy to MP this could result in higher energy-related GHG emissions, depending on the sustainability of energy production.\nFuture research could address some of the identified gaps by studying the impacts of meat and dairy analogues in an integrated assessment model, which accounts for energy demand and production including GHG emissions, and economy-wide impacts, next to a detailed representation of land-use dynamics. In addition, this would allow us to analyse the role of meat and dairy analogues as part of a portfolio of climate change mitigation options.\nMethods\nMAgPIE land-use model\nMAgPIE was developed and used to assess the competition for land and water and the associated consequences for sustainable development under future scenarios of rising food, energy and material demand30. The model version we used in this study is MAgPIE v.4.3.4 (ref. 31) (see the data availability statement at the end of the article for details). MAgPIE combines economic and biophysical approaches to simulate spatially explicit global scenarios of land use within the 21st century and the respective interactions with the environment (Supplementary Fig. 1). The MAgPIE framework has been used to simulate mitigation pathways for different SSPs15 and contributed to several reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change43,44.\nMAgPIE is a global multiregional partial equilibrium model of the land-use sector45. The model integrates regional economic conditions such as demand for agricultural commodities, technological development and production costs as well as spatially explicit data on biophysical constraints into an economic decision-making process based on the concept of recursive dynamic cost optimization. Geographically explicit data on biophysical conditions are provided by the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed land model46,47 on a 0.5-degree resolution and include, for example, carbon densities of different vegetation types, agricultural productivity such as crop yields and water availability for irrigation. Owing to computational constraints, all model inputs in 0.5-degree resolution are aggregated to simulation units for the optimization process on the basis of a clustering algorithm48. Available land types in MAgPIE are cropland, pasture, forest, other land (including non-forest vegetation, abandoned agricultural land and deserts) and settlements. Cropland (rain-fed and irrigated), pasture, forest and other land are endogenously determined, whereas settlement areas are assumed to be constant over time. Cropland covers cultivation of different crop types (for example, temperate and tropical cereals, maize, rice, oilseed, roots), both rain-fed and irrigated systems and two second-generation bioenergy crop types (grassy and woody). International trade is based on historical trade patterns and economic competitiveness. Food demand is derived on the basis of population growth and dietary transitions, accounting for changes in intake and food waste, the shift in the share of animal calories, processed products, fruits and vegetables as well as staples.\nIn this study, we derived the following environmental indicators from MAgPIE (see Extended Data Table 1 for a structured overview), of which most have been used in previous studies2,34,49,50,51. Annual deforestation (Mha year\u22121) was calculated on the basis of the differences in forest area between time steps. As the calculation was based on changes of forest area, annual deforestation may have varied substantially between time steps (stock and flow problem). To avoid that our results are biased by the values of single years, we calculated in a post-processing step an average value of annual deforestation by applying a function (low-pass filter) that distributes values of annual deforestation over time, while making sure that the time integral over the modelled period are the same. Similarly, annual net CO2 emissions (Mt CO2 year\u22121) from land-use change were calculated on the basis of changes in carbon stocks of vegetation and therefore may have varied substantially between time steps (stock and flow problem). To avoid biased results, we applied the low-pass filter function also on annual net CO2 emissions from land-use change. Carbon stock changes in vegetation are subject to land-use change dynamics such as conversion of forest into agricultural land34. In case of afforestation or when agricultural land is set aside from production, regrowth of natural vegetation absorbs carbon from the atmosphere (removals). N2O emissions (Mt N2O year\u22121) from agricultural soils (fertilizer application) and animal waste management were estimated on the basis of nitrogen budgets for cropland, pastures and the livestock sector49,51. CH4 emissions (Mt CH4 year\u22121) from agriculture include emissions from enteric fermentation, animal waste management and rice cultivation, which were estimated on the basis of feed demand, manure and rice cultivation area, respectively49,50. Nitrogen fixation (Mt N year\u22121) is a proxy for nitrogen losses to the environment and hence ecosystem degradation. Nitrogen inputs on cropland via industrial (for example, production of inorganic fertilizers) and intentional biological fixation were calculated on the basis of a nitrogen budget approach2,51. Agricultural water use (km3 year\u22121) depends on the water requirements of crops, the available water for irrigation, irrigation efficiency and irrigation infrastructure, which can be extended endogenously on the basis of cost-effectiveness52. For more information on the MAgPIE modelling framework, we refer the reader to the model source code and documentation (see the data availability statement).\nMP in MAgPIE\nFermentation-based MP production was implemented in an earlier version of MAgPIE to study the impacts of replacing animal feed with microbial protein28. Building on this previous research, we included a refined implementation of MP production into MAgPIE v.4.3.4 (ref. 31) to study the impacts of replacing ruminant meat with MP in human diets. In line with the literature on MP for human consumption, we assumed a dry matter (DM) protein content of 45% in microbial biomass (based on mycoprotein)4,6. For the production of MP, we assumed that sugar cane, grown on cropland, was needed as feedstock. Using the results of Pikaar et al.28, we assumed that 4.3 ton of sugar cane would be needed to produce 1 ton of microbial biomass, all on a DM basis. This suggests that approximately 0.2326 ton DM microbial biomass can be produced from 1 ton DM sugar cane. Assuming that 1 ton DM sugar cane yields 0.3363 ton DM sugar, we get 0.69 ton DM microbial biomass from 1 ton DM sugar, which is well within the range of 0.42\u20130.87 ton DM microbial biomass per ton DM sugar published in Lape\u00f1a et al. (Table 1)29. Sugar cane cultivation is largely limited to tropical and subtropical regions. Therefore, in our modelling framework, temperate and boreal regions partly rely on imports of feedstock for MP production. For ruminant meat, we assumed a food protein content of 33% in DM (own calculations based on FAOSTAT8 using a DM content of 41%). The DM food protein content of 33% reflects an average value across different ruminant meat products including beef, ground beef and processed meat. The corresponding fresh matter food protein content of 13.5% is comparable to other estimates for the average food protein content of beef products53,54. We used the DM protein content for the per-capita substitution of ruminant meat with MP. Together with the DM protein content of 45% in microbial biomass, this suggests that 1 ton DM ruminant meat is replaced by 0.73 ton DM MP. With regard to costs, we assumed that each ton DM MP costs US$789, using Supplementary Table 9 in Pikaar et al.28. The costs account for energy, oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus requirements. Feedstock costs were excluded to avoid double accounting as MAgPIE has its own feedstock costs. We did not account for the environmental consequences of MP production beyond the land-use sector. In particular, we did not account for the energy requirements and energy-related GHG emissions of MP production.\nScenario assumptions\nThe reference scenario (SSP2-Ref-MP0) is based on SSP2 with regard to population, income, diets, land-use regulation and trade. The MP scenarios (SSP2-Ref-MP20, SSP2-Ref-MP50 and SSP2-Ref-MP80) differ from the reference scenario only with regard to the per-capita substitution of ruminant meat with MP in human diets. The consumption of per-capita protein summed over ruminant meat and MP is the same (Fig. 1a). In the MP scenarios, we assumed that 20, 50 and 80% of the per-capita ruminant meat consumption is substituted with MP by 2050 in each model region. The fade-in of MP follows an S-shaped curve to mimic the typical adoption of new technologies and products by consumers. In our modelling framework, livestock commodities (ruminant meat, whole milk, pork, poultry meat and eggs) are produced in five animal food systems (beef cattle, dairy cattle, pigs, broilers and laying hens). The production of ruminant meat is allocated to beef cattle and dairy cattle systems according to historical shares. However, the substitution of ruminant meat with MP in our scenarios only aims at reducing ruminant meat from beef cattle. Dairy production is largely unchanged, even at high MP substitution rates (Extended Data Fig. 4). Our scenario set-up with relative substitution rates (20, 50 and 80%) by 2050 in each model region is designed to enable straightforward comparison of environmental indicators between scenarios and regions. However, this suggests that low-income countries would cut ruminant meat consumption with the same level of ambition as high-income countries, neither accounting for the overall share of livestock products in diets and the likelihood of adopting new diets nor addressing the economic and cultural context in which a substitution of ruminant meat with MP would take place.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this paper.\nData availability\nThe numerical scenario results, including instructions for reproduction and the analysis scripts supporting the findings of this study are available at Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5794460 under a CC-BY-4.0 licence.

      "text": "Per capita meat consumption in European countries 2018-2024\nThe per-capita meat consumption in Germany increased from an estimated 46 kilograms in 2018 to 47.9 kg by 2022. Consumption in Italy and Spain also increased. Poland saw the largest rise in meat consumption in this time period. Consumption of meat in France remained mostly stable.\nMeat consumption in Germany\nGerman meat consumption is currently decreasing. Pork consumption especially, the biggest meat category by consumption volume, has declined since 2014. For 2022, the per capita consumption of pork is estimated to be under 30 kilograms for the first time. Germany has the highest share of young individuals who consider themselves to be vegetarian among European countries. With the growing importance of these younger generations, meat consumption is likely to keep declining.\nMeat consumption in the UK\nThe generational shift in consumption habits is also visible in the United Kingdom. Meat-free nutrition is the goal for over a quarter of millennials in 2023. The share of Generation Z consumers who aimed for a meat-free diet in 2023 was 43 percent. Beef and veal are on the chopping block. From 2006 to 2019/20, consumption per person per week declined from 128 to 97 grams per person."

      "text": "A row over meat consumption in Spain over the last month is just the most recent eruption of the debate all over Europe, as the continent grapples with making its famous cuisines more sustainable.\nFood is inextricably intertwined with national identity for countries in continental Europe; a good steak, with perfect frites stacked beside it; a plate of wafer thin carpaccio, drizzled with dressing or plain old olive oil; wurst, served with good mustard; jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico laced with creamy white fat.\nEuropeans love their meat, and they eat a lot of it. About 1.5kg a week is consumed by the average citizen of the EU27 \u2013 that\u2019s twice the global average.\nBut it is also clear that if there is to be any hope of reducing the impact of global heating, that consumption level will have to fall rapidly. Greenpeace estimates that it will need to drop by 70% by the end of the decade, and down to 300g by 2050. That translates (since not all the meat that leaves slaughterhouses ends up being either sold or eaten) to each European actually eating, per week, a quantity of meat equivalent to about two good-sized hamburgers.\nThe response to this news? Unenthusiastic, to say the least. Politically, balancing the priorities of environmental action against the clout of often powerful farming lobbies and the expectations of populations accustomed to consuming large quantities of unrealistically cheap meat looks nearly impossible.\nIn Spain, for example, which holds the dubious honour of being the EU member state with the highest per capita meat supply in the bloc (more than 100kg per person, per year) the consumer affairs minister, Alberto Garz\u00f3n, was engulfed in a national row last July after calling on his compatriots to eat less meat for the sake of the environment and of their own bodies. \u201cOur health and the health of our families is at stake,\u201d he said. \u201cEating too much meat is bad for our health, and for the planet.\u201d\nWithin hours, he had been slapped down not just by the agriculture minister, but by the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez. Asked what he made of Garz\u00f3n\u2019s plea, S\u00e1nchez observed: \u201cSpeaking personally, a medium-rare steak is hard to beat.\u201d\nThere is evidence that many Europeans are taking the issue seriously. One recent survey showed almost half (46%) of European consumers are now eating less meat than they once did, while 40% are planning on reducing their meat consumption in the future.\nThe EU-backed study, of more than 7,500 people in 10 European countries, found a third actively sought to minimise their meat consumption \u2013 with 73% of that group saying they had \u201csubstantially\u201d reduced their meat intake over the past months.\nBut in its latest document, the European Commission suggests that despite clear and growing public awareness of the importance of sustainability, EU meat consumption per capita, left to its own devices, is likely to fall by little more than 3kg a year.\nGovernment intervention, then, will be essential, but, judging by Spain\u2019s example, difficult. Garz\u00f3n again told the Guardian in December that people had to reduce their meat consumption, and contrasted meat from traditional, extensive farming with that produced on intensive megafarms, but parts of Garz\u00f3n\u2019s interview were seized on by the conservative People\u2019s party and the far-right Vox party, who have demanded he resign for what they portray as an unforgivable attack on Spain\u2019s important meat industry and the quality of its exports.\nThe consumer affairs minister has stuck by his words, accusing \u201cthe lobby of certain big companies which promote polluting megafarms\u201d of deliberately distorting what he said. His comments, moreover, do not differ wildly from official government policy. The ministry for ecological transition wants extensive production systems promoted, and well-adapted native breeds used more. The agriculture minister has praised small family farms, and some regional governments have already acted to limit intensive farming.\nIn Germany, traditionally among the EU\u2019s biggest consumers of animal-based products per capita, meat-eating has declined steadily over the last two decades, but here too the politics are sensitive.\nThe Green party, part of the new three-party coalition with the centre-left SPD and the liberal FDP, might have been expected to throw itself into accelerating the falling trend, but has so far held back.\nThe hesitancy comes from painful political experience. Germany\u2019s Greens have suffered in recent years from being seen as a Verbotspartei, intent on banning the joys of life. A 2013 \u201cveggie day\u201d initiative for meat-free days at state-subsidised canteens saw the tabloid Bild complain that \u201cthe Greens want to take our meat away\u201d.\nInstead, the environmental party has used its first weeks in power to initiate a less politically exposing campaign against junk meat sold for junk prices. The new agriculture minister, Cem \u00d6zdemir, told Bild Germans were losing out because food quality and food prices were too low.\nJunk prices, often imposed by all-powerful supermarket chains, he said, \u201cdrive farms to ruin, prevent animal welfare, promote species extinction and burden the climate. I want to change that.\u201d The price of food should, he said, echoing the findings of a commission set up by the previous government, reflect the \u201cecological truth\u201d and consumers must get used to paying a fair price for better quality.\nBut this approach, too, is far from universally popular: the new government\u2019s attack on cheap meat was criticised by the Parit\u00e4tische Gesamtverband, an umbrella group for Germany\u2019s social welfare organisations, which argues higher food prices must be accompanied by compensation payments for those on low incomes.\nAnd in Italy, the environment minister, Roberto Cingolani, triggered a fiery debate last year by saying excessive meat consumption was harmful to health and the environment, adding that encouraging Italians to eat less meat would be central to his plans.\n\u201cChanging our diet will have the combined benefit of improving public health, decreasing water use and producing less CO2,\u201d Cingolani said. Farmers hit back instantly, saying annual meat consumption per capita in Italy is among the lowest in Europe and meat was an important part of a balanced diet.\nActivists including Luca Mercalli, a well-known metorologist, are keeping the debate alive, arguing that better quality meat produced closer to home and consumed in smaller quantities would make a significant difference to the environment.\n\u201cA proportion of Italians are sensitive to the topic and have changed their diets, either due to concerns about the climate or dietary motives,\u201d Mercalli said. \u201cThe problem in Italy is the debate often turns toxic, with vegetarians becoming very judgmental of meat-eaters, which in turn alienates 90% of the population.\u201d\nThe onus should be on the government to provide clearer information, he said. \u201cThe message should be: eat less meat, but when you do, buy locally produced meat that is more sustainable. Even if you pay more, eating better quality meat once a week is far better than eating a cheap hamburger every day.\u201d\nFrench meat consumption has also been falling steadily, with surveys suggesting half the population has reduced their meat consumption over the past three years and that 30% would like to continue doing so over the next three. And yet howls of outrage greeted the launch of France\u2019s national low-carbon strategy, adopted in 2020, which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture \u2013 which represent 20% of the country\u2019s total, with fully 80% generated by livestock farming \u2013 by 19% by 2030 and 46% by 2050.\nEU countries that have tried to implement concrete meat reduction policies have faced instant backlashes. The Danish government was forced in 2020 to reverse a ban on state canteens serving meat for two days every week after trade unions and the food industry objected, and the government has now instead switched its focus to boosting non-meat food production, approving a climate agreement that features the EU\u2019s largest investment in plant-based research and development, including an annual fund to support the transition to a nationwide dietary shift. In the Netherlands, in an attempt to prioritise tackling the major environmental issues long caused by its intensive pig and other farms, the new government features a minister for nature and nitrogen affairs, Christianne van der Wal-Zeggelink.\nAnd all of this is no less true for the European Commission itself, struggling with the incompatibility of ambitious carbon emission reduction plans and the vast common agricultural policy subsidies that account for nearly a third of the EU\u2019s budget. Greenpeace has broken down the numbers and calculates that a fifth of the EU\u2019s entire budget is spent on livestock.\nAs recently as 2020, the EU was still spending money to promote meat eating with a controversial and frankly slightly mad ad campaign exhorting people to become Beefatarians. \u201cIf the sound of beef sizzling on the grill brings tears to your eyes, you\u2019re a real Beefatarian,\u201d coos the ad. Confused? It\u2019s only going to get worse."

  "argos_summary": "MicroHarvest, a startup based in Hamburg and Lisbon, is pioneering the production of microbial protein from agricultural waste, aiming to revolutionize food sources with a sustainable, vegan protein powder. This innovative process utilizes microbes to convert leftover sugars into a protein-rich powder, which is already being incorporated into pet food and may soon be available for human consumption. The fermentation method is highly efficient, requiring significantly less land and water compared to traditional animal farming, and could drastically reduce carbon emissions and deforestation if adopted widely. However, challenges remain, including regulatory hurdles and consumer acceptance of microbial protein as a food source.",
