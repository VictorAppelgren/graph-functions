      "feedback": "Strong ambition and a coherent regime framework are the positives, but the draft must tighten format, grounding, and fidelity to the section brief. Actionable edits: (1) Format strictly 4 mover lines with exactly: Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %. Use five segments per line, and attach only regime-based citations after any fact-number in the line (no extraneous prose). Rebalance the lines to 0–6 weeks, 6–24 weeks for Up and Down to avoid overlap, rather than “into 3–6 months.” (2) Base probabilities on explicit regime weights from the material (Regime I ~50%, Regime II ~30%, Regime III ~20%). Allocate 50% of total probability to the Up lines and 50% to the Down lines, e.g., Up 0–6w 30%, Up 6–24w 20% (Regime I); Down 0–6w 20%, Down 6–24w 30% (Regimes II/III), with citations like (NL5YYTLF2) after the numbers where appropriate. Do not mix arbitrary % without mapping to the regime tree. (3) Clarify tradability for the Swing Trade section: decide whether this is a tradable instrument; if not, compress the Outlook to 1 line as required; if yes, supply a single Swing Trade line with Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence, anchored to concrete, source-supported KPIs (e.g., GM Cadillac capex cadence, US chip-fab announcements, OBBBA/tariff milestones). (4) Strengthen first-principles and catalysts: explicitly trace the causal chain from AI-driven productivity to capex allocation in semis/data-center infra and to sector leadership, adding quantitative anchors (e.g., “GM/U.S. capex > $4B; U.S. fabs capex progress toward 2M annual units” with source IDs like WTNT85IPR) and clear invalidation rules (tariff escalation past 25%, UBI/retraining dampening productivity, or policy reversal). (5) Tighten watchpoints and avoid overloading the lines with private-market anecdotes; pick 3–4 core, source-backed triggers (tariff path, OBBBA milestones, Ford/EV-margin signals, GM Cadillac cadence, chip/AI infra capex) and align the watchlist to those. (6) Resolve numeric conflicts and ensure all critical sources are consistently represented; if you invoke oil-path or debt-number claims, cite the exact IDs (e.g., J99EM2TPZ, EPJYXB7DX) and present a concise base-case with a clearly stated range rather than ad hoc values. (7) Eliminate redundant or conflicting phrases (e.g., “into 3–6 months” in a 6–24 week line) and deliver a compact, reader-friendly swing-outlook that adheres to the mandated length, preserving a single, cohesive thread from regime framing to actionable triggers.",
