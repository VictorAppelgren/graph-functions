  "summary": "Plane ticket prices have surged by 4% in July, the first monthly increase since January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index. Domestic capacity among US airlines dropped 6% in August from the previous month, compared to a 4% cut in 2024 and a 0.6% dip in 2023. This is due to a decrease in demand since President Donald Trump introduced steep tariff rates in April and several countries issued travel advisories against the US due to an executive order recognizing only two sexes. To offset this, airlines have slashed their prices in an attempt to attract customers. Despite uncertainty over the effects of the Trump trade war, tariffs on foreign nations are largely lower than the rates announced in April.",

      "text": "Trump issued executive order defining sex as \u2018male and female\u2019: \u2018These are sexes that are not changeable\u2019\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump on his first day in office Monday issued an order defining a person\u2019s sex as \u201cmale or female\u201d \u2014 requiring government agencies to use the \u201cimmutable\u201d designation on forms and IDs while also ordering changes to federal prison policies that govern transgender inmates.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing today is defining that it is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes: male and female. These are sexes that are not changeable, and they are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality,\u201d an incoming White House official told reporters.\nThe policies are included in an executive order \u2014 one of dozens that Trump, 78, signed shortly after he assumed the presidency around noon.\nThe order prevents people from changing their sex on US passports \u2014 which currently allow for holders to choose male, female or \u201cX\u201d \u2014 and will attempt to ban medical transition treatment for prisoners. Both new policies are likely to face litigation.\nThe order requires the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and other agencies \u201cto ensure that official government documents, including passports and visas, reflect sex accurately,\u201d the incoming official said.\nAmericans since 2010 \u2014 including during Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 have been able to change their sex on passports by submitting forms with a physician\u2019s approval.\nHowever, outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken ended the doctor\u2019s sign-off for passports in 2021 and added the \u201cX\u201d gender marker in 2022.\nThe aide did not mention whether the president would ban trans men from participating in women\u2019s sports, too, but Trump did say at a pre-inaugural rally Sunday that he would take action to \u201ckeep all men out of women\u2019s sports.\u201d\nThe prison policies, meanwhile, will impact a population that the ACLU estimates at 1,200 federal inmates.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to add privacy in intimate spaces \u2026 like women\u2019s prisons, women\u2019s migrant shelters, rape shelters [and] make sure the taxpayer funds are not being used to have so-called transition services,\u201d the incoming official said about Trump\u2019s order.\nIt\u2019s unclear how the policy will impact transgender prisoners currently in women\u2019s prisons.\nVery few transgender inmates have received transition surgeries on the taxpayer\u2019s dime \u2014 with Texas inmate Donna Langan believed to have become the first in December 2022, the 19th reported.\nTransgender rights became a campaign issue ahead of last year\u2019s election \u2014 with Trump vowing to attempt to end the participation of people born male in female sports.\nDemocratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, the outgoing vice president, received negative coverage and groans from her allies following the unearthing of her past pledge to support taxpayer-funded sex changes for illegal immigrants in federal custody.\nHarris defended herself by arguing that doing so was the law and that Trump would have to follow the same guidelines."

      "text": "Marvel leaves Georgia to film superhero movies in UK \u2014 gutting state\u2019s movie industry: \u2018You feel like a jilted lover\u2019\nMarvel Studios has shifted most of its production out of Georgia in favor of the United Kingdom \u2014 a move that has gutted the Peach State\u2019s film industry, wiping out nearly half its spending and leaving once-bustling soundstages largely empty.\nThe Disney-owned studio behind \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d and \u201cShe-Hulk: Attorney at Law\u201d filmed nearly two dozen projects in Atlanta over the past decade.\nBut starting with this summer\u2019s \u201cFantastic Four: First Steps,\u201d Marvel is shifting its superhero slate \u2014 including two new \u201cAvengers\u201d films and the next \u201cSpider-Man\u201d \u2014 to facilities outside London.\nWhile major studios including Disney, Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery threatened boycotts over Georgia\u2019s 2019 abortion law, with some smaller productions leaving in protest, Marvel\u2019s current exodus to the UK is driven purely by economics.\nRising labor costs in Georgia tipped the scales. In the UK, crews are paid less and studios aren\u2019t saddled with health insurance expenses, making it cheaper to shoot overseas, a person familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal.\nThe result has been devastating. Georgia\u2019s film and TV spending has plunged nearly 50% in three years, with just 245 projects filmed in the fiscal year ending June 2025 \u2014 down from 412 in 2022.\n\u201cYou feel like a jilted lover,\u201d Janine Gosselin, 62, a script supervisor who once made $200,000 a year working Marvel sets, told the Journal.\nShe hasn\u2019t had steady work since February 2024 and has borrowed from her retirement fund to cover bills.\nThe downturn has film workers so demoralized they\u2019ve turned the state\u2019s famous jingle into a joke. Crew members on the game show \u201c25 Words or Less\u201d sang new lyrics to the \u201cMade in Georgia\u201d tag earlier this year: \u201cUnemployed in Georgia.\u201d\nTrilith Studios \u2014 Marvel\u2019s longtime 1,000-acre production hub near Atlanta, with 34 stages and its own housing village \u2014 has gone quiet after years of nonstop demand.\n\u201cWe were fighting over stages on a daily basis because there just wasn\u2019t enough room for Marvel and whatever other show was trying to film,\u201d location scout Lenzi Sealy, who worked on four Marvel projects, told the Journal.\nNow, she says, the lot is \u201clargely empty.\u201d\nSealy remembered February\u2019s \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d shoot, when rumors spread it might be Marvel\u2019s Georgia swan song.\nHer fears came true weeks later when the studio held an auction to sell props it had accumulated during its decade in the state.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when it really hit home,\u201d she told the Journal.\nFor local crews, Marvel wasn\u2019t just another client \u2014 it was the cornerstone. The studio\u2019s high-budget blockbusters employed hundreds at a time and kept workers busy year-round.\n\u201cMarvel allowed me to do so much with my life and really set the trajectory for my career,\u201d said grip John Grubb, 44, who worked six Marvel films.\nHe even calls his $350,000 home \u201cthe house \u2018Avengers\u2019 bought.\u201d\nThe collapse comes after a meteoric rise that began in 2008, when Georgia expanded of its film tax credit to 30%, uncapped \u2014 making it one of the most generous in the world.\nThe policy turned Atlanta into the so-called \u201cHollywood of the South.\u201d\nFranchises rushed in: Lionsgate\u2019s \u201cHunger Games,\u201d Universal\u2019s \u201cFast & Furious,\u201d Netflix\u2019s \u201cStranger Things\u201d and AMC\u2019s \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d\nAt its peak, the industry supported nearly 20,000 jobs, according to a 2023 Georgia State University study.\nBut the global economics have changed. Across the US, 29% fewer big-budget movies and shows began filming in 2024 compared to 2022, according to ProdPro.\nIn the UK, that number jumped 16%.\nOther countries like Canada and Australia continue to lure projects. States including California, New York, New Jersey and Texas are pumping up their own incentives to compete.\nLee Thomas, director of the Georgia Film Office, said rising labor costs drove Marvel and others out.\n\u201cWe hope that this is an anomaly where they\u2019ll try out other markets and will return to Georgia because they have faith in our crew and facilities and our tried-and-true incentive,\u201d she told the Journal.\nTrilith CEO Frank Patterson is betting the slump will end, predicting a \u201cnew normal in 2027.\u201d\nIn the meantime, his company is investing in startups that make content exclusively on the studio\u2019s stages.\nThe Post has sought comment from the Georgia Film Office and Marvel."

AT&T faces a $177\u202fmillion settlement for two data breaches that could pay up to $7,500 to affected customers, while the U.S. film industry is suffering as Marvel shifts production out of Georgia to the UK, cutting jobs and spending.
