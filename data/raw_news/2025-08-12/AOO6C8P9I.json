  "description": "Cameron Brink heads to the locker room just before halftime with apparent knee issue before Sparks fall to the Liberty.",
  "content": "Sabrina Ionescu of the New York Liberty drives to the basket against Azura Stevens in the first quarter.\n\nAlmost hidden in a mocha pair of sweatpants and sweatshirt, and crowned with those same fire-red Air Jordans from his Aug. 4 return to Los Angeles, Clippers royalty Chris Paul adorned the Sparks\u2019 bench.\n\nAnd though the 20-year veteran barely lifted a palm \u2014 leaving the cheering to his wife and daughter \u2014 Paul\u2019s court savvy still seemed to seep across the hardwood, finding its way to the Sparks\u2019 Kelsey Plum.\n\nPlum, who can very well be the tale of any Sparks game, but \u201cchooses to win,\u201d as coach Lynne Roberts says, seemed to be scoring and assisting at will through a coast-to-coast battle against the New York Liberty, a tug-of-war that stayed taut until the rope finally slipped from the Sparks\u2019 grasp, 105-97.\n\nThe Sparks\u2019 stalwart would finish with 26 points alongside five rebounds and five assists.\n\nAcross the court, with veteran Breanna Stewart sitting due to a right knee bone bruise, the internationally seasoned presence of Emma Meeseman assumed control to keep the Liberty\u2019s offense in rhythm, its poise intact and restart its win streak.\n\nEmma Meeseman, who made her Liberty debut soon after Stewart\u2019s exit, looked nothing like someone fresh off a lengthy league layoff on Thursday. The 2019 Finals MVP returned Aug. 3 after a three-year hiatus from the WNBA \u2014 time she spent competing for Belgium \u2014 and strung together a season-high 24 points alongside nine boards against the Sparks.\n\nStewart took the hit to her knee during the last edition of the East-West rivalry on July 26. And that was also a game before Sparks sophomore star Cameron Brink returned from a 13-month-long left knee injury.\n\nAbout three minutes before halftime, Brink sat on the bench while trainers wrapped her knee during a Sparks timeout. She never joined the team\u2019s halftime huddle as play resumed after the break, and when she finally emerged at the 6:17 mark in the third quarter, she would stay on the bench to watch the rest of the game from her seat.\n\nAt halftime, a Sparks spokesperson told The Times that there was no update on Brink\u2019s exit to the locker room.\n\nIn absence of the Sparks\u2019 most threatening defensive presence, though, Dearica Hamby and Azur\u00e1 Stevens policed the key and cleaned up under the rim to ensure the Sparks stayed close. The two combined for 38 points and 12 rebounds by night\u2019s end.\n\nThe loudest battle, however, seemed to be the fans versus the officials.\n\nFans groaned and barked over whistles \u2014 and the no-calls in between \u2014 as the night wore on. Roberts shared the mood, zeroing in on referee Tyler Mirkovich during a defensive sequence late in the second quarter. She sustained dialogue through the ensuing timeout, punctuating her point with a seemingly sarcastic double thumbs-up in Mirkovich\u2019s direction.\n\nWhether the whistles were true or not may be argued long after the final horn, but no call was going to bail the Sparks out of a 10-point ditch with 22 seconds left to play.",

      "text": "Streaking Sparks defeat an Indiana Fever team missing Caitlin Clark\n- Share via\nThe Indiana Fever arrived in Los Angeles draped in momentum: Five straight wins, a knack for winning without Caitlin Clark and betting lines tilting their way. Their tear was proof they could keep pace even with their franchise centerpiece in street clothes.\nBut another storyline might\u2019ve been tucked beneath Indiana\u2019s.\nThe Sparks had ripped off six wins in their previous seven outings, probably fueled by the rare luxury of having every piece of their roster back for the first time in more than a year. And by night\u2019s end at Crypto.com Arena, they had won seven of eight, the Sparks grinding out a 100-91 victory.\n\u201cTonight was a great step in the right direction,\u201d guard Kelsey Plum said. \u201cThat\u2019s an incredible team, and they\u2019re as hot as anyone. \u2026 They got everything it takes to make a run for a championship. So for us to come out and have that level of intensity, I was really proud.\u201d\nSidelined since July 15 with a right groin injury, Clark never touched the hardwood Tuesday. But her presence was impossible to miss.\nAbout an hour before tip\u2011off, Clark entered the arena to a wave of shrieks. Fans crammed shoulder\u2011to\u2011shoulder against the banisters and barricades, stretching jerseys, bobbleheads and posters toward her for autographs. But once the ball went up, Clark left her imprint not in ink but as an assistant coach to her Fever squad.\nFor all of Clark\u2019s fire from the bench, the Sparks (13-15) seized on her absence to wrest control from one of the league\u2019s hottest teams and move closer to a playoff berth.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got enough pieces and talents to make a playoff run,\u201d Sparks coach Lynne Roberts said. \u201cWe just got to keep our foot on the gas. As I always say, we didn\u2019t come into the season saying we wanted to beat Indiana at home. We came in the season saying we want to make the playoffs.\u201d\nRoberts, who has spent much of the season juggling lineups amid injuries and roster turnover, can finally exhale, with a healthy starting five, Cameron Brink back in uniform and a bench ready to contribute.\nWith stable rotations came steady results. Plum set the night\u2019s tempo, piling up 25 points and 11 assists. Around her, the Sparks\u2019 scoring core \u2014 Rickea Jackson matching with 25, Dearica Hamby dropping 16 and Azur\u00e1 Stevens racking up 19 \u2014 kept the scoreboard humming. Julie Allemand steered the offense in sync, dishing out seven assists to go with five points and eight rebounds.\nWe all in this room know she [Plum] can go for 40,\u201d Roberts said, \u201cbut she wants to win more than go for 30. And if going for 40 is what it takes to win, then she\u2019ll do it. But tonight, she gained so much attention from the other team\u2019s scouting report \u2014 as she should \u2014 but she\u2019s \u2026 trying to win.\u201d\nMidway through the first quarter, Brink checked in, snagged a couple of boards, and promptly stuffed a shot by 6\u2011foot\u20112 Natasha Howard for the first of five rejections on the night.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just getting that chemistry on and off the court,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cBut when we\u2019re playing like that and feeding off each other\u2019s energy, that\u2019s fine, and that\u2019s when we\u2019re going on our runs, and that\u2019s when we\u2019re not flinching because we trust each other that much.\u201d\nAfter Rae Burrell spun in an acrobatic layup to put the Sparks ahead 32\u201130, they never loosened their grip, stretching the lead to 90\u201168 midway through the third quarter. But Aari McDonald and Kelsey Mitchell sparked a 21\u20115 run that, suddenly, had the game uncomfortably tight with under two minutes remaining.\nBut in a building where wins have been scarce, the Sparks clutched this one tight and handed it back to the L.A. faithful.\nSex toy tossed on court\nA sex toy landed near Indiana\u2019s Sophie Cunningham after it was thrown from the stands.\nThe incident occurred with 2:05 left in the second quarter, with the object landing in the lane near Cunningham, who had been vocal on social media admonishing fans for throwing sex toys on the court during other games. The Fever forward jumped back in surprise and then Plum kicked it into the stands.\n\u201cI think its ridiculous, it\u2019s dumb, it\u2019s stupid,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s also dangerous and players\u2019 safety is number one. Respecting the game. All those things. I think it\u2019s really stupid.\u201d\nPlum added that she thought both teams did a great job \u201cplaying on, don\u2019t give it any attention. The refs too, I really appreciate them too, was just like hey let\u2019s go.\u201d\nCunningham walked over to the Sparks bench and was laughing about it.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

      "text": "Dearica Hamby and Kelsey Plum lift Sparks to another hard-fought win over Seattle\n- Share via\nLess than 10 days ago, the Seattle Storm and the Sparks battled deep into a second overtime \u2014 the first of the 2025 WNBA season \u2014 wringing every drop of drama out of Climate Pledge Arena. On Sunday night, the same stakes were at play as the teams tried to strengthen their playoff chances.\nThe intensity didn\u2019t let up till the final horn. With 5.6 seconds left, Dearica Hamby roared into the paint and scored on a driving layup to put the Sparks ahead for good. After the Storm missed their final chance to win, pandemonium spilled onto the floor \u2014 Sparks players leaping into one another\u2019s arms, fans hollering over the hardwood, chanting \u201cHamby\u201d in celebration of the Sparks\u2019 94-91 victory.\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing for that kind of game,\u201d said guard Julie Allemand, who had eight assists, \u201cit\u2019s exciting to play that kind of game. At the end, when you make the great shot that we need, it\u2019s a great feeling.\u201d\nVeronica Burton scores 16 points and Cecilia Zandalasini finishes with 14 to help lead the Golden State Valkyries to a 72-59 win over the Sparks.\nThe Sparks managed to rally after falling into a 16-point deficit in the first quarter, perhaps a symptom of playing on back-to-back nights.\nThen came Kelsey Plum \u2014 who finished with 20 points, seven assists and six rebounds \u2014 bending her game in every direction to haul the Sparks to their ninth win in 11 games.\nSparks coach Lynne Roberts has painted Plum as a shape-shifter \u2014 able to twist her game into whatever the game demands.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what your best players should do \u2014 get everybody else involved and make sure we\u2019re flowing,\u201d Roberts said before the game, \u201cand then when they need you, you step up. She\u2019s done a tremendous job.\u201d\nTrailing the Storm (16-16) by 17 in the first quarter, Plum, who still hadn\u2019t scored yet, tore into a one-on-five fast break, freezing the defense with a hesitation at the arc and a glide into the basket for a three-point play. Seconds later, Plum created another opportunity off an extended right elbow, drilling a three-pointer in Erica Wheeler\u2019s face.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been known as a scorer and I learned that over time, your impact on the game a lot of time is because you can score, you\u2019re going to draw attention and find people,\u201d Plum said. \u201cOn the run we\u2019ve been on, we\u2019re better when I\u2019m kind of doing both.\u201d\nIt was the spurt of momentum the Sparks (15-16) needed to overcome a sputtering start.\nPlaying the entire first half, Plum went from the table-setter to shot-maker in the second quarter \u2014 springing Rae Burrell for a corner three before splashing a triple to tie the score 29-29 with 6:30 left in the second quarter.\n\u201cLeadership is hard, figuring out when to push, when to pull, when to give it up, when to take it over,\u201d Roberts said. \u201c[Plum] just continues to get better and better at it. ... She\u2019s so competitive and wants to win.\u201d\nAzur\u00e1 Stevens and Cameron Brink were strong in the key early, but the Sparks clanked jumpers, dribbled into traffic and watched offensive possessions die on the rim in addition to committing eight first-quarter turnovers. So Roberts rolled the dice on a smaller look \u2014 swapping her paint patrol of Stevens and Brink for guards Julie Vanloo and Burrell.\nAn 18-year-old man has been arrested after throwing a sex toy at a Phoenix Mercury game Tuesday. It is one of at least five incidents of such objects being thrown.\n\u201cWhen they go really big, we kind of went a little smaller with Rickea [Jackson] at the four,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt was a battle of wills \u2014 it seems like every time, like the last time we played them, back and forth.\u201d\nPlum and Allemand kept the smaller unit in constant motion, whipping passes from wing to wing and slicing open lanes for Burrell and Jackson, while Vanloo, Allemand and Plum cashed in from beyond the arc. Roberts rode that group into the second quarter, and they eventually whittled the deficit.\nHamby finished with 19 points and seven rebounds, Stevens had 15 points and eight rebounds and Brink contributed 14 points, five rebounds and two steals off the bench.\nWhen the final buzzer faded, players were still grinning through hugs, and the crowd\u2019s \u201cHamby\u201d chants continued \u2014 excitement for a Sparks team that had yanked itself out of the fire.\n\u201cReally proud of that bounce-back,\u201d Plum said. \u201cWe could have folded \u2014 especially early. But there\u2019s something to this team. We\u2019re young, we\u2019re competitive, we\u2019re hungry.\u201d"

      "text": "Cameron Brink returns but Aces end Sparks\u2019 winning streak\n- Share via\nThirteen months after tearing an anterior cruciate ligament, Sparks forward Cameron Brink made her season debut, stepping onto the court at the 2:39 mark of the first quarter.\nBrink looked comfortable despite the long layoff, jumping into the midseason contest intensity with confidence. She was active and competitive throughout, playing 13 minutes and 55 seconds during her return.\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to have her back, and I\u2019m incredibly proud of her,\u201d Sparks coach Lynne Roberts said. \u201cShe\u2019s on a minutes restriction. \u2026 I told her that she needs to enjoy the moment. \u2026 It\u2019s a hard injury to come back from mentally and physically, and she\u2019s done it with a smile on her face.\u201d\nBut the night marked the end of the WNBA\u2019s longest active winning streak, as the Sparks fell 89-74 to the Las Vegas Aces on Tuesday night at Crypto.com Arena.\nRickea Jackson scored a career-high 30 points, Azura Stevens had 19 points and 10 rebounds in leading the Sparks past the Aces.\nThe Sparks (11\u201115) trailed by double digits for most of the game and couldn\u2019t recover against the surging Aces (14\u201113), who extended their lead to as much as 21 points.\nIn the third matchup between the two teams this season, the Sparks came out a bit hesitant, while the Aces were the aggressors from the tip.\n\u201cThat was the worst shooting we\u2019ve had all season,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be able to defend. It\u2019s knowing personnel, it\u2019s knowing tendency, it\u2019s staying locked into the game plan even when they score the first eight points.\u201d\nThe Aces leaned on strong starts from Jackie Young and A\u2019ja Wilson, who combined for 34 points in the first half.\nWilson finished with 34 points, 10 rebounds and four assists, while Young recorded a triple-double with 18 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists.\nA\u2019ja Wilson finishes with 35 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Las Vegas Aces to a 96-81 victory over Kelsey Plum and the Sparks.\nDearica Hamby remained a bright spot for the Sparks, contributing 15 points and six rebounds. Hamby was named WNBA Western Conference player of the week after leading the Sparks to three wins, including a road victory over the defending champion New York Liberty on Saturday.\nKelsey Plum added 22 points, five rebounds and eight assists in the loss. Brink had five points, including a three-pointer, three rebounds, one block and one steal in 14 minutes of play.\n\u201cI was really proud of her,\u201d Plum said of Brink. \u201cI told her after the game, \u2018It\u2019s very impressive to come in, make the impact that you did.\u2019 ... I think she\u2019s gonna continue to just help us a ton.\u201d\nThe Sparks, who had been rolling offensively, were startled by their difficulty scoring.\n\u201cWe have been so used to making shots and so I think it caught us off guard a little bit,\u201d Roberts said.\nThe Sparks will look to regroup before playing the Storm in Seattle Friday night."
