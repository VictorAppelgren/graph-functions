  "content": "Why Did They Stop Putting CD Players In New Cars?\n\nSince the mid-2010s, fewer and fewer new cars have been decked out with CD players. In-dash stereos are instead usually equipped with the long-standing car radio and some kind of media playback option, such as auxiliary or USB inputs or a digital infotainment system like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. But with CDs having a resurgence, along with physical media more generally, it's easy to wonder why automakers are ditching players by the roadside. Surprisingly, some automakers still offer new cars with CD players, although it's increasingly rare. Subaru and Lexus are two of the last makers barely hanging on, with the Forester making waves when it gave up the ghost and removed CD players in 2024. Lexus still provides CD players for a few of its models, including the IS. According to MotorTrend, the inclusion of a CD player for the IS isn't based on any \"consumer feedback or insights\" \u2014 it's because the range hasn't been refreshed since 2013. The music industry has changed a lot since 2013, and consumer choices reflect that. In the years since then, the demand for streaming and CDs has essentially switched, with streaming becoming the much more popular option. Cars are made to suit consumer needs, which helps automakers sell more units, so companies have shifted to cater to streaming instead. This change in consumer priorities was made particularly clear when Subaru informed Which? that the Forester would drop its standard CD player in 2024 to bring the SUV in line with the maker's other product lines.\n\nCDs are still popular, but streaming is more mainstream Car CD players are still popular. Over in the United Kingdom, the Digital Entertainment and Retail Association told Which? that 15% of drivers listen to CDs while driving. In the United States, they accounted for a revenue of over $540 million in 2024 (per the Recording Industry Association of America). But even though people still use CDs, even more people use their successor: streaming services. Spotify alone has more than 250 million premium subscribers, which doesn't account for those using the free tier or subscribed to other services. Streaming is a hugely popular, convenient option that gives music lovers access to a massive library of tunes through the internet at a relatively low cost. Understandably, it's tough for physical media to compete with it on a purely practical level. Plus, with streaming, you don't have to worry about lugging around bagfuls of jewel cases or pulling over to try and switch albums. As a result, cars are kitted out with everything you need to stream efficiently instead. Some vehicles have systems like Android Auto that allow you to connect your phone directly to your stereo to play music from streaming platforms like Tidal, Spotify, or Apple Music. Others take a more analogue route by allowing you to connect your phone or media player using an auxiliary cable with the device's headphone jack. Since so many people already use or can easily access music digitally, prioritizing streaming options allows brands to appeal to a wider audience.\n\nHow to make the most of your CDs on the road Although the days of loading up your car's CD changer with \"Best Ofs\" and homemade mixtapes before a long drive are entering the rearview, there are still a couple of ways you can enjoy your physical media collection on the road. You'll just need a car stereo that you can connect to external media or storage devices and a disc drive. If you're dead-set on using your CDs, you can pick up a portable CD player with an auxiliary output or Bluetooth or a USB disc drive to operate directly through the car stereo. It's far from an ideal scenario, though, as some systems won't be compatible, and even the slightest dip in the road could lead to skips or even scratched discs. If you remember carrying around a Sony Discman, then that probably won't come as any surprise to you. Alternatively, you can take your collection with you by digitizing it. It might seem a little counterintuitive \u2014 you won't be playing your CDs directly in the car, after all \u2014 but doing so will help to protect your discs from damage while giving you access to your music anywhere. You can digitize your CD collection by loading it into your computer's disc drive and importing the data into media software like iTunes. This is called \"ripping.\" Your computer might not have a disc drive built-in, in which case you'll need to grab an external one (just make sure it's writable). Once you've imported your CD's files, you can load them up onto a USB drive and stick it into your car's USB port, if it has one. You should be back to enjoying your physical music collection while daytripping in no time.",

      "text": "Disc-go inferno: death of the in-car CD player\nFollowing the recent decision by Subaru to remove the in-car CD player from one of its SUVs, we scoured the new cars offered by all mainstream car brands in the UK to look for any remaining stalwarts. After countless hours of research, we can announce the death of the in-car CD player.\nThe disappearance of CD players from cars isn\u2019t new, but up until recently, there were still a few offering a physical alternative to digital in-car streaming.\nRead on to find out which models were the last to come with a CD player and what your options are if you want to listen to CDs in new cars.\nBest cars for 2024: view the models that scored highly in our lab tests.\nEnd of an era\nRemember the good old in-car cassette player? Lexus was among the last manufacturers to offer a factory-fitted cassette player on its SC model, which remained on sale until 2009. And it was another Japanese brand that was the last to offer a CD player.\nUp until just a few months ago, a CD player came as standard in Subaru's Forester mid-sized SUV (as shown in the image below). However, Subaru told us that the model was recently updated for the 2024 model year, and as part of that, the CD player was removed, bringing the Forester in line with the rest of the brand\u2019s range.\nWhile cars with large CD-changer systems (often situated in the boot) haven\u2019t been sold in the UK for many years, only last year you would have found plenty of new models (such as the Subaru XV, Porsche 718 and Lexus LC) with single-disc CD players.\nBut with the Subaru Forester now shunning the humble CD player, it really is the end of an era.\nWe explain how to buy the best new car in our guide.\nCD sales on the up\nUnsurprisingly, not everyone is happy with the demise of the in-car CD player.\nAccording to data from the Digital Entertainment and Retail Association, CD sales saw a year-on-year increase of 3.2% in the first half of 2024.\nKim Bayley, CEO of the Digital Entertainment and Retail Association, said: \u201cWith 15% of the UK adult population reporting that they listen to CDs in their cars, this is a remarkably short-sighted move by carmakers to stop fans listening to the music they love.\n\u201cTaylor Swift is leading the way. The 172,000 CDs sold in the UK this year of her latest album \u2018The Tortured Poets Department\u2019[2] is more than the three biggest-selling cars in the UK last year combined[3]. Car manufacturers should listen to the Swifties and give the CD another chance\u201d\nAlso, when asked what frustrates them most about their car in our latest survey, many respondents were clearly dismayed about the lack of a CD player.\n\u2018Very disappointed that there was no option to have a CD player fitted,\u2019 said a Ford Focus Estate (2018 to present) owner, while a Dacia Sandero Hatchback (2013-21) driver commented: \u2018I bemoan the lack of a CD player.\u2019 Many other owners simply exclaimed: \u2018No CD player!\u2019\nHow to continue listening to CDs in new cars\nThe only way to play music in new cars from now on (without buying extra kit) is to stream it through a device such as your smartphone or to listen to the radio. Of course, streaming has its advantages, not least that you can listen to a vast library of songs in your car \u2013 certainly more than would be possible with a wallet of CDs. And with many cars linking seamlessly to your phone by Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, streaming from services such as Amazon Music and Spotify has never been easier.\nOf all mainstream vehicles available to buy new, the Isuzu D-Max pick-up truck is the only one available with a CD player. At the time of writing, three out of four trim levels come with one, so be sure to not accidentally get the one without.\nOf course, buying a new car doesn\u2019t have to mean opting for a brand-new model. You can browse the used-car market for models with CD players (check out the more affordable used models we recommend in our guide to the best cheap cars).\nOne final option is to buy a portable CD player and connect it to your new car\u2019s entertainment system (most have either a USB or 3.5mm audio input). This isn\u2019t without issues, though, and even on the smoothest of roads, a portable CD player is likely to suffer from the occasional skip.\nDrive smarter and cut costs using our expert advice.

      "text": "Stop Everything\u2014There\u2019s Still a New Car On Sale With a CD Player?!\nFed up with streaming and subscription services? Consider the mobile CD player that is the Lexus IS500.\nIf you want entertainment on a drive, there\u2019s no shortage of options to choose from. Streaming services, podcasts (may I suggest The InEVitable?!), satellite radio, and good old-fashioned AM/FM radio are all great options. Those of us driving cars built before 2015-ish may also enjoy the simple pleasures of a CD player, as the feature was largely omitted after that. I, personally, thought compact disc players weren\u2019t a thing in cars anymore\u2014until I sat in a 2024 Lexus IS500 F Sport Performance Premium a couple of weeks ago.\nYes, you read that right: This is a car you can buy new in the year of our Lord, 2024, that still comes with a CD player. If being able to own a naturally aspirated, V-8-powered sport sedan wasn\u2019t reason enough to consider the IS500, there\u2019s this. Actually, now that I think about it, the CD player might be more compelling than the engine; that certainly applies in the less-powerful IS300 and IS350 models that also enjoy the feature. Lexus isn\u2019t merely purveying CD players in new cars, either\u2014it seems to have several models that offer them, including the RC coupe and, until just recently, certain LC coupes and convertibles.\nMaybe you\u2019ve forgotten or are unaware of the marvelous experience of playing a CD in your car. With basically all media shifting to a subscription service nowadays, the humble compact disc player feels especially prescient. Records are enjoying a renaissance, after all, so why shouldn't CDs?\nHere\u2019s a list of reasons why these flat bits of plastic deserve a resurgence.\n- No subscription service needed. You own the music you buy, forever.\n- CDs generally offer better sound quality than streaming.\n- You are not reliant on cell reception, a data plan, or Wi-Fi to stream your music.\n- No annoying commercials.\n- Android Auto and Apple CarPlay not required.\nFurthermore, a CD forces you to listen to an album in the order that the artist intended. I\u2019m not saying people don\u2019t do this when they stream albums, but it seems like building playlists is the go-to move, where we tend to pick and choose singles rather than letting an album run through its entire thematic course. Green Day\u2019s American Idiot is a rock opera, for crying out loud. The story doesn\u2019t make sense if the songs are missing or out of order!\nI asked Lexus if keeping the CD player around was due to favorable customer feedback over the years.\n\u201c[The] IS has featured a CD player since the current generation debuted,\u201d a Lexus rep responded via email. That debut happened in 2013, if you were curious. \u201cIn the years that have followed, the IS has not received any major refreshes, so the CD player has remained in the interior. While we do occasionally hear similar comments about having a CD player being an interesting feature, the continuation of this is not in response to any consumer feedback or insights.\u201d\nAh, well. Just as with its available V-8, the IS remains unique today by way of literally not getting an update in, like, a bajillion years. (Though the V-8 was added back to the IS family after a long vacation, after the IS F went away last decade, the 5.0-liter engine itself has been around as long.) But in this case, it\u2019s not a bad thing at all.\nMaybe like with those cassette aux adapters, there will eventually be a market for CD players that can stream music to your car stereo via Bluetooth. I took a spin around the internet and it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a widespread product for this use case. Yet. (There are, however improbably, Bluetooth-enabled cassettes that can take a streaming feed from your modern device and play it in your tape-deck-only ride.) But seeing as there is open hostility toward mounting subscription costs, someone just might snap one day and invent something for those of us with well-stocked CD collections that are slowly gathering dust.\nSo, if you\u2019re also fed up with how we\u2019re meant to enjoy media in cars moving forward, consider the mobile CD player that is a brand-new Lexus IS or RC. Rage against the enshittification of absolutely everything. Embrace CDs once again. Heal.\nI got into cars the way most people do: my dad. Since I was little, it was always something we\u2019d talk about and I think he was stoked to have his kid share his interest. He\u2019d buy me the books, magazines, calendars, and diecast models\u2014everything he could do to encourage a young enthusiast. Eventually, I went to school and got to the point where people start asking you what you want to do with your life. Seeing as cars are what I love and writing is what I enjoy doing, combining the two was the logical next step. This dream job is the only one I\u2019ve ever wanted. Since then, I\u2019ve worked at Road & Track, Jalopnik, Business Insider, The Drive, and now MotorTrend, and made appearances on Jay Leno\u2019s Garage, Good Morning America, The Smoking Tire Podcast, Fusion\u2019s Car vs. America, the Ask a Clean Person podcast, and MotorTrend\u2019s Shift Talkers. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, cooking, and watching the Fast & Furious movies on repeat. Tokyo Drift is the best one.\nRead More"

      "text": "Apple CarPlay Vs Android Auto: Which Is Best?\nIn addition to better fuel efficiency, environmental sustainability, and longevity, the newest cars are safer than ever. We have innovations like lane assist, backup cameras, and responsive braking systems that help keep you and everyone around you from horrific accidents and costly repairs. But one of the most underrated safety features in these vehicles are the in-dash displays. The best ones provide pertinent information and one-touch controls for music, navigation, and communication, even if you should be shunning the latter while the wheels are rolling.\nThe displays have gotten bigger over the years, providing bigger buttons and more legible text to lessen the amount of time spent squinting at your dashboard while your eyes should be on the road. You could use your smartphone, but those are smaller, and they may obstruct your view if you have to mount it to your windshield.\nThat's where Apple CarPlay and Android Auto come in. These systems allow your phone to connect directly to your infotainment system, giving you access to your contacts, messages, music, and maps without having to program them into your car separately, all in an interface designed for safety and ease of use. They serve the same purpose, but in very different ways. Which of them is best? That depends.\nWhat Is Apple CarPlay?\nApple CarPlay is the in-car infotainment system developed by Apple. It was first launched in 2014, well ahead of Android Auto. As such, the list of compatible cars is significantly deeper than that of Android Auto's, so more people are likely to already have a vehicle that can take advantage.\nCarPlay allows you to connect your iPhone to your car's display, giving you access to a variety of features such as navigation, music, and the voice assistant Siri, which you can call on using your voice to control your music, send and receive text messages, and get directions.\nThe main benefit of using CarPlay is that it allows you to stay connected and use your iPhone's features without having to take your eyes off the road. For example, you can use Siri to make phone calls, send text messages, and play music without having to physically interact with your iPhone. Additionally, CarPlay supports a wide range of third-party apps, including Spotify and Audible.\nMany modern cars with rich in-dash units will typically support CarPlay over a USB connection, especially if they were made after 2014. Some newer cars can do this wirelessly. In all, more than 600 vehicles support Apple CarPlay. You'll want to check your specific make and model's manual to see where you land, which you can do at Apple's website here.\nWhat is Android Auto?\nAndroid Auto is similar to Apple CarPlay, except it only works with Android phones. It aims to serve up much of the same information and benefits, but with a different aesthetic and alternative core apps. For instance, while CarPlay uses Siri for voice-activated control, Android Auto can do the same with Google Assistant. For navigation, you get Google Maps instead of Apple Maps. Android Auto can also integrate with third-party apps to serve up music and podcasts, just like CarPlay can.\nSomething else that sets Android Auto apart is the ability to cast content from third-party apps, including video. In fact, Android Auto has deeper third-party app support overall, with many more Auto-enabled apps available in Google Play compared to the CarPlay-ready counterparts available in Apple's App Store.\nLike CarPlay, you can use Android Auto in supported vehicles over a USB connection, but some of them now offer wireless Android Auto built-in (though it's less widespread than wireless CarPlay as of writing). Google says more than 150 million vehicle owners have access to Android Auto, and you can check if your model is included in its vehicle list here.\nUser interface and apps\nDespite the similarities, the in-car experiences between CarPlay and Android Auto differ significantly. Many people prefer CarPlay's user interface as it can show more information at once in any given scenario. In fact, you can view information from different apps at the same time with its multi-window setup. You can also customize the look with various wallpapers, giving Apple Maps a more pleasing and inviting ambiance.\nAndroid Auto used to be limited in comparison, as it favored keeping the focus on one app at any given time. Some argued this was the safer approach, as there are fewer distractions to keep you busy while driving.\nThe point is moot now, however, as Android Auto's big 2022 update brought a split-screen user interface that can keep your messaging and playback controls handy while you're navigating or using other apps. Plus, some Android Auto functions handle momentary information better, such as how new incoming text messages appear as a banner over the current app you're using.\nKeeping with the tradition and spirit of Android's origins, Android Auto is also the platform of choice for tinkerers, as you can access hidden features via your Android phone to enable advanced options and settings that are typically meant for developers to use. Helping its case is that you can now access many more video apps, such as Tubi and Epix, directly within Android Auto, with the safety caveat that you must be parked.\nVoice assistants\nNaturally, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto rely on their respective platforms' default voice assistant \u2013 Siri for the former, and Google Assistant for the latter. In either case, you can use your voice to initiate phone calls, ask for directions, and control audio playback.\nGoogle Assistant has historically edged Siri with regard to voice recognition. It typically struggles less with a wider variety of conversational commands. That said, Siri has improved vastly in this area, and that gap may narrow even further with a forthcoming update Apple previously announced would arrive sometime in 2023.\nBoth will easily execute their automotive-focused tasks quite well, so the difference comes down to auxiliary functions and features that you might consider to be cherries atop, such as the fact that Google Assistant hooks directly into many more third-party apps than Siri does. Google Assistant will also give you a real-time preview of how it's transcribing any messages you want to send, which can help you catch any embarrassing typos before you send it off.\nNavigation\nWhen it comes to turn-by-turn directions, we'll have to give the nod to Apple CarPlay for the best overall system. Why? Well, it gives you the ability to choose between both Apple Maps and Google Maps (among other third-party options such as Waze), whereas Android Auto gets completely snubbed from the Apple Maps experience. This is no fault of Google's, mind you.\nBut if we had to favor just one in-car platform that may sway your purchasing decision for either your next phone or vehicle, we'd go with Android Auto. Not only does Google Assistant seemingly transcribe, parse, and act on your commands better than Siri does, but Google Maps is generally found to be more accurate and detailed than Apple Maps with regards to navigation routes.\nAt the end of the day, which of these is right for you depends more on your individual tastes. Are you team iPhone until the day you die? Well, make sure your car supports CarPlay. Ditto with Android Auto. We'd say there are much more important considerations to decide whether Android or iPhone is best for you when weighing the totality of each platform's capabilities against your needs.\nOur best advice is to figure out what that means for you first, and then make your next car purchasing decision based on the smartphone you favor. Luckily, many vehicles now support both CarPlay and Android Auto."
