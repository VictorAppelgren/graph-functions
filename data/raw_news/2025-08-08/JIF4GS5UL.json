  "description": "As companies pursue faster, smarter and more secure operations, hardware configuration is becoming a critical competitive differentiator.",
  "content": "While emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain have been capturing headlines, businesses must also keep an eye on evolving hardware trends. As companies pursue faster, smarter and more secure operations, hardware configuration is becoming a critical competitive differentiator.\n\nIn an era shaped by AI adoption, rising end-user expectations and tightening privacy regulations, IT leaders are reevaluating not only what hardware their organizations need, but also where it should reside and how it should be deployed. Below, members of Forbes Technology Council share key hardware strategies designed to deliver the flexibility, security and cost efficiency modern enterprises require.\n\nAI-embedded hardware security at the edge is becoming essential. By integrating intelligent processing directly into devices\u2014servers, endpoints and storage\u2014companies can achieve real-time, autonomous security; reduce latency; and protect privacy without cloud dependence. This hardware-native AI trend will be critical for secure, scalable operations in the near term. - Camellia Chan, Flexxon\n\nWe\u2019re seeing a shift toward inference-optimized hardware\u2014systems designed specifically for running, not training, AI models. As model deployment scales, general-purpose GPUs waste energy and rack space. Purpose-built accelerators with high memory bandwidth utilization will be essential for cost-effective, real-time AI. - Thomas Sohmers, Positron AI\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify?\n\nDisaggregated infrastructure is rising fast\u2014separating compute, storage and memory lets companies scale AI workloads efficiently. Paired with smart NICs and GPUs, it\u2019s the backbone for low-latency, high-throughput architectures in tomorrow\u2019s data centers. - Sai Krishna Manohar Cheemakurthi, U.S. Bank\n\nEdge AI accelerators are gaining traction\u2014particularly in the insurance industry, where devices that can analyze claims locally are deployed in field adjusters\u2019 kits. These devices slash cloud costs while preserving privacy. Key benefits include TOPS/watt efficiency, hardware-encrypted data pipelines, and precertification for IEC 62304 medical-grade reliability. The future is distributed intelligence. - Srinath Chandramohan, EY\n\nHybrid cloud\u2014combining locally hosted servers and public cloud providers\u2014is a trending configuration. This strategy can help businesses reduce costs while maintaining the flexibility to scale when needed. - Anto Joseph, Eigen Labs\n\nAs a public safety company, we\u2019re seeing increasing demand for edge-enabled safety infrastructure\u2014devices like smart panic buttons, mobile gateways and compact edge processors that can locally process video, audio or wellness data before syncing with cloud-based platforms. This reduces latency, enables real-time decision-making in emergencies, and enhances privacy by limiting data exposure. - Kevin Mullins, SaferMobility\n\nA key trend is integrating edge computing with AI, enabling real-time data processing near the source. This reduces latency and bandwidth, which is crucial for IoT and smart systems. Advances in processors and AI chips facilitate local data analysis, enhancing decision-making and efficiency. Adopting this trend can help companies in data-driven industries cut costs, improve performance and stay competitive. - Gautam Nadkarni, Wipro\n\nEnabling hardware to run localized foundational models is key. Current foundation models and large language models require significant infrastructure and pose security risks due to generalization and centralized data processing. New approaches deploy personalized models on small devices like watches or phones, enabling secure local processing and paving the way for personalized AI assistants. - Abhijeet Mukkawar, Siemens Digital Industries Software\n\nA growing trend is building edge computing setups equipped with GPUs or AI chips close to where data is generated. The advantages include reduced delays, because information is processed locally; bandwidth savings; and scalability. These reliable, flexible and modular hardware configurations allow factories and telecom sites to run AI-powered tasks on site, enabling faster responses, stronger data protection and more efficient workload management. - Maman Ibrahim, EugeneZonda Cyber Consulting Services\n\nLocal compute is making a comeback. Everyone chased the cloud\u2014until inference costs punched them in the face. We used to fight over RAM; now it\u2019s NVMe lanes, PCIe bandwidth and power delivery. Welcome to the AI hardware wars! But AI-native workloads demand rack design, not just chip choice. If your data center layout hasn\u2019t changed since 2015, you\u2019re not ready. - Mirror Tang, ZEROBASE\n\nWe\u2019re in the early stages of a shift toward energy-optimized hardware. Organizations are investing in renewable-powered data centers to meet ESG goals and reduce their carbon footprints. - Ohm Kundurthy, Santander Bank\n\nI\u2019m seeing accelerated compute AI clusters doing double duty for both training and inference. The push toward agentic and multimodal AI requires significant processing power to solve complex problems and advance AI autonomy. - Steven Carlini, Schneider Electric\n\nOne significant trend is the shift to modular hardware setups, such as servers and storage, which allow for scaling up or down as needed. This lets companies add power or space without a full rebuild, making it easier to keep up with changing needs and control costs. It\u2019s a flexible approach that\u2019s quickly becoming standard. - Ganesh Ariyur, Gainwell Technologies\n\nOne essential hardware trend is AI-accelerated edge computing. By processing data closer to its source with neural processing units and specialized chips, companies reduce latency, improve privacy and enable real-time decision-making. As AI becomes core to operations, edge intelligence will be critical for speed, scalability and resilience. - Rishit Lakhani, Nile\n\nAdopting heterogeneous hardware compatibility and mixed-hardware serving is essential. This enables the flexible use of diverse hardware types\u2014GPUs, CPUs and ASICs\u2014across generations and vendors, boosting capacity utilization and cutting costs. It supports scalable AI workloads by running models efficiently on mixed hardware fleets, increasing agility and sustainability. - Pooja Jain, Meta (Facebook)\n\nA growing hardware trend is edge computing\u2014processing data closer to the user instead of relying entirely on the cloud. It\u2019s becoming essential for real-time decision-making in privacy-sensitive environments. For example, in AdTech, edge setups enable brands to deliver faster, more compliant, personalized ads without sacrificing speed or data security. - Ivan Guzenko, SmartyAds Inc.\n\nA clear short-term trend is the adoption of hybrid CPU-GPU architectures optimized for AI and data analytics workloads.

If the door\u2019s flimsy, no lock will hold back invaders.\nexpert panel\nThe majority of everyday users have little understanding of the role data centers play in the global technology system. But without data centers storing, processing and managing vast (and ever-growing) amounts of data, the digital services we rely on\u2014from websites to apps and from generative AI to e-commerce\u2014wouldn\u2019t be possible. As we increasingly depend on instantaneous access to data for work, commerce, research, entertainment and more, the challenges of maintaining sustainable, reliable data centers are growing, with the explosion in AI usage adding fuel to the fire. Fortunately, along with challenges are coming cutting-edge solutions (including some powered by\u2014you guessed it\u2014AI). Below, members of Forbes Technology Council discuss both the complications and innovations they see coming to data center management in the near term.\nexpert panel\nInsider threats can be either malicious\u2014for example, someone with authorized access to an organization\u2019s systems deliberately steals sensitive data and sells it for personal gain\u2014or innocent\u2014for example, an employee unwittingly clicks on a phishing link in a seemingly legitimate email, introducing malware into company systems. Either way, insider threats can be devastating and costly: Globally, the total annual average cost to companies of resolving insider threats is $16.2 million. It\u2019s essential for companies that leverage digital tools to establish a well-rounded, robust strategy for combating insider threats, with the primary goal, whenever possible, of preventing them altogether. Below, members of Forbes Technology Council share expert tips to help organizations across industries address (or better yet, avoid) insider threats.\nexpert panel\nAs industries and organizations have been grappling with the rapid rise of artificial intelligence, the focus has often been, \u201cWhat specific tasks or processes can AI improve for us?\u201d While that is a productive and necessary exercise, it risks missing the forest for the trees\u2014AI is poised to not only help businesses make discrete, micro improvements, but also to change the overall business landscape in ways that will impact everyone in the workforce, top to bottom. Preparing your organization and your team for an AI-forward future requires knowing what\u2019s coming\u2014both in terms of new capabilities and possible challenges. Below, members of Forbes Technology Council discuss some of the AI trends they believe will have a significant impact on business operations and growth.
