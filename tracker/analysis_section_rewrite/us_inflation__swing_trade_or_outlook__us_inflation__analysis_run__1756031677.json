      "feedback": "Strengths: the draft tightly anchors a multi-year AI/cloud regime to observable datapoints (e.g., MSFT backlog ~$368B, cloud CAGR ~21%, Shopify 31% YoY growth, Workers Leaders outperformance), which provides a solid fundamental spine for a sector tilt. Gaps: the Movers section mixes drivers and catalysts too fluidly, the four lines would benefit from crisper, one-driver-per-line framing, and probabilities anchored to specific facts with exact in-text citations; there are extraneous long passages and non-essential narrative that violate the required concise, line‑by‑line format; and invalidation triggers are underdefined or qualitative rather than testable metrics. Also ensure every numerical claim used in the lines maps to a source ID and is consistently cited; avoid duplicative or non-cited numbers, and keep to the four required lines (2 Up, 2 Down) plus a single 1–2 line Outlook if the asset is tradable.\n\nActionable edits to reach world-class quality:\n- Reformat the Movers to exactly four lines: Up | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %, and do the same for Down, ensuring two Up and two Down. Each line must hinge on a single, testable mechanism drawn from the material (Base Case, Accelerant, Slowdown, Stress) and must cite concrete numbers (e.g., 21% cloud CAGR, $368B backlog, 31% revenue growth) with in-text IDs after the probability only if you assert those facts.\n- Tighten “What to watch” into 1 crisp sentence per line, focused on a trigger or threshold (e.g., backlog growth holding above a threshold, AI uptake pace vs baseline, cloud capex pace within a specified range). Tie each line to a concrete invalidation rule (e.g., if AI adoption decelerates and cloud CAGR falls outside 19–23% for two consecutive quarters, invalidate the Up line; if backlog growth decelerates sharply, invalidate the Up or turn it to Neutral/Down line).\n- Ground all probabilities in explicit material facts and distribute citations only for those facts (e.g., 55% tied to a base-case confidence in MSFT/Shop/Now/CRM earnings durability; 20% tied to macro/regulatory risks). Avoid repeating citations or using non-sourced assertions.\n- Ensure the Outlook/Swing Trade section is separate and compliant: decide tradability (MSFT/SHOP/NOW/CRM are liquid equities) and provide either 1 Swing Trade line (Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence) or a concise 1-line Outlook if you want to keep it non- trading. If you keep Swing, fill in price-based inputs (Entry/Stop/Target) anchored to current price ranges you can obtain from a feed, with explicit triggers (e.g., backlog deviation, AI uptake milestones) as the “Trigger.”\n- Remove all nonessential narrative and parallel analyses in the movers block; ensure the four lines mirror the exact structure, use the same four sources for the numeric anchors, and reconcile any cross-source tensions in a brief watchlist section if needed (but not within the four lines).\n- Audit for consistency and coverage: ensure all critical sources that actually underpin the numeric anchors (0G3A676BP, 4LQD15CFU, UPV3X2MQ6, FOM34PUWA, A7VLN74BK, J99EM2TPZ, RHXDOHQQX, TN66GHPAT, etc.) are represented in the final lines and that no important counterpoints are left out (e.g., regulatory/regulatory-tail risks, wage dynamics) with explicit watchlist triggers.\n\nIf you want, I can draft a compliant four-line Movers set plus a single-line Outlook (and a Swing Trade skeleton if you confirm tradability) that strictly adheres to the format, citations, and evidence-based probabilities.",
