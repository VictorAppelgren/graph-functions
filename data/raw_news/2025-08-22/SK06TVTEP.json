  "description": "Announces Double Digit System Wide Sales Growth, Strong Same Store Organic Revenue and 100% YoY Adjusted EBITDA Growth for its Fleet",
  "content": "MiniLuxe continued its momentum with year-over-year growth. Q2 2025 system-wide sales delivered $7.7M versus prior year of $6.9M, translating into a year-over-year increase of 12%. Total H1 2025 system sales grew to $14M from $12.6M, an 11% year-over-year increase. On a company basis Q2 2025 net revenue increased 8% to $7.5M compared to Q2 2024 revenue of $6.9M. H1 2025 revenue was $13.6M representing 8% growth over H1 2024. This revenue growth was driven by continuous focus on levers to enhance the unit economics of the Company\u2019s underlying fleet of studios and the overall strength on studio leaders and operating partners that it is attracting. In Q2, the median average unit volume for MiniLuxe\u2019s top quartile studios exceeded $1.8M per unit store and for the trailing four quarters, cash contribution was up nearly 20% across the fleet. The second quarter of 2025 also delivered positively across all key metrics of profitability. For Q2 2025 there was ~$3.2M in gross profit, representing a 5% increase from $3M in Q2 2024. H1 2025 delivered total gross profit of $5.7M, or an 8% increase over H1 2024 of $5.3M. Gross profit margin contracted slightly in Q2 2025 versus prior year by 1 percentage point, as a result of intentional investments to recruit and develop nail designers which ultimately added staffing hours. These additional staffing hours were critical towards realizing the demand across peak weekends and holidays such as Easter, Mother\u2019s Day and the Fourth of July. As a proxy for the health of the operating cash flows, the Company focuses on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) growth. Management also sees its adjusted EBITDA as a key success indicator towards long-term profitability. In Q2 2025, the Company\u2019s operating loss was ($1.2M) a $0.3M improvement over Q2 2024, primarily driven by higher revenue. For H1 2025, the Company\u2019s operating loss was ($3.2M), a $0.1M improvement over H1 2024. Taking out non-cash items such as stock-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA for total company (inclusive of all overhead) came in for Q2 2025 at ~($.8M) while Fleet 4-wall adjusted EBITDA nearly doubled from prior year\u2019s performance at $1.4M from $.8M. The core studio base continues to drive attractive and growing unit economics with a consistent and resilient multi-year trend of growth. In Q2 2025, service revenue from the fleet increased by $0.6M to $7.4M, or 9% over Q2 2024. MiniLuxe saw strong trends on the demand and supply side of its business: (a) positive momentum on the demand side (new client and loyal client growth) and (b) growth and development of supply side (talent ecosystem growth). The Company maintained its high level of talent engagement and held a YoY retention rate of 87% at the end of the second quarter. \u201cOur positive and strong second quarter results represent the execution focus of the leadership and field team alongside our incredible and growing team of operating partners and field associates on delivering an exceptional and consistent client experience.\u201d said Tony Tjan, Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder of MiniLuxe. And he continues, \u201cWe are, of course, proud to have another record quarter in which we estimate our growth to be 2x industry growth for retail sales and are grateful for the loyalty of our clients and team.\u201d The following table outlines the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024: The following table presents cash and cash equivalents as of June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024: This press release references certain non-IFRS measures used by management. These measures are not recognized under International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d), do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS, and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of the Company\u2019s results of operations from management\u2019s perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the Company\u2019s financial information reported under IFRS. The non-IFRS measures referred to in this press release are \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d and \u201cFleet Adjusted EBITDA.\u201d\n\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDA most accurately reflects the commercial and operational reality of the Company\u2019s operations on an ongoing basis by adding back non-cash expenses. Additionally, the rent-related adjustments ensure that studio-related expenses align with revenue generated over the corresponding time periods. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back fixed asset depreciation, right-of-use asset amortization under IFRS 16, asset disposal, and share-based compensation expense to IFRS operating income, then deducting straight-line rent expenses net of lease abatements. IFRS operating income is revenue less cost of sales (gross profit), additionally adjusted for general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense. The Company also uses Fleet Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of its MiniLuxe Core Studio business. This metric is calculated in a similar manner, starting with Talent revenue and adjusting for non-fleet Talent revenue and cost of sales, further adjusted by fleet general and administrative expenses and finally subtracting straight line rent expense. The Company believes that this metric most closely mirrors how management views the fleet portion of the business. The following table reconciles total company Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the periods indicated: The following table reconciles Fleet Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the periods indicated: , a Delaware corporation based in Boston, Massachusetts.

This press release contains \u201cforward-looking information\u201d and \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d (collectively, \u201cforward-looking information\u201d) concerning the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of applicable securities laws. Forward-looking information may relate to the future financial outlook and anticipated events or results of the Company and may include information regarding the Company\u2019s financial position, business strategy, growth strategies, acquisition prospects and plans, addressable markets, budgets, operations, financial results, taxes, dividend policy, plans and objectives. Particularly, information regarding the Company\u2019s expectations of future results, performance, achievements, prospects or opportunities or the markets in which the Company operates is forward-looking information. In some cases, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \u201cplans\u201d, \u201ctargets\u201d, \u201cexpects\u201d, \u201cbudgets\u201d, \u201cscheduled\u201d, \u201cestimates\u201d, \u201coutlook\u201d, \u201cforecasts\u201d, \u201cprojects\u201d, \u201cprospects\u201d, \u201cstrategy\u201d, \u201cintends\u201d, \u201canticipates\u201d, \u201cbelieves\u201d, or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results \u201cmay\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d, \u201cwould\u201d, \u201cmight\u201d, or \u201cwill\u201d occur. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, intentions, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances contain forward-looking information. Statements containing forward-looking information are not historical facts but instead represent management\u2019s expectations, estimates and projections regarding future events or circumstances.\n\nMany factors could cause the Company\u2019s actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including, without limitation, those listed in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of the Company\u2019s filing statement dated November 9, 2021. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements prove incorrect, actual results, performance, or achievements could vary materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Forward-looking information, by its nature, is based on the Company\u2019s opinions, estimates and assumptions in light of management\u2019s experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that the Company currently believes are appropriate and reasonable in the circumstances. Those factors should not be construed as exhaustive. Despite a careful process to prepare and review forward-looking information, there can be no assurance that the underlying opinions, estimates and assumptions will prove to be correct. These factors should be considered carefully, and readers should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking information. Although the Company bases its forward-looking information on assumptions that it believes were reasonable when made, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions with respect to the Company\u2019s future growth potential, results of operations, future prospects and opportunities, execution of the Company\u2019s business strategy, there being no material variations in the current tax and regulatory environments, future levels of indebtedness and current economic conditions remaining unchanged, the Company cautions readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which the Company operates may differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. In addition, even if the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which it operates are consistent with the forward-looking information contained in this press release, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Although the Company has attempted to identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking information, there may be other risk factors not presently known to the Company or that the Company presently believes are not material that could also cause actual results or future events to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking information. There can be no assurance that such information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such information. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information, which speaks only as of the date made (or as of the date they are otherwise stated to be made). Any forward-looking statement that is made in this press release speaks only as of the date of such statement.",

(TSXV: MNLX) today announced the appointment of its new Chief Financial Officer, Lanchi Venator.\nEffective immediately, Ms. Venator will formally assume all key financing, reporting and control functions from Ms. Elizabeth Lorber (the Company\u2019s current Chief Commercial Officer and Acting CFO). Ms. Lorber has been serving in an interim capacity since the Company announced its plans in mid-February of 2025 for a transition in its financial leadership. Ms. Venator has been serving as a senior advisor to the Company since the beginning of the 2025 year across a range of strategic and financial matters and will report directly to MiniLuxe\u2019s CEO, Anthony (Tony) Tjan.\nMost recently, Ms. Venator served as the Global CFO & Head of Strategy for KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken), where she was responsible for driving growth and profitability and delivering on the annual financial performance targets for the global KFC business. While there, she had oversight over 14 international Business Unit CFOs as well as a Strategy and FP&A team based in Dallas, TX. Prior to KFC, Ms. Venator was Senior Vice President of Global Finance & Strategy and Chief of Staff to the EVP & CFO of The Estee Lauder Companies.

During her advisory period, we were able to not only affirm a strong chemistry and complementary of skill and responsibilities but a complete alignment on MiniLuxe\u2019s vision to radically and positively transform the nail care industry. I look forward to partnering with her in the years ahead,\u201d said Tony Tjan.\n\u201cI am super excited to join the MiniLuxe team. The past months have clearly demonstrated to me the potential value creation opportunity within MiniLuxe and the fit with my strategic and financial skills and experiences across multi-unit franchising and the beauty industry can have an impact. Most important I love the people in the Company and the opportunity to redefine an industry,\u201d said Lanchi Venator.\nAs part of the normal course of an equity-based (in lieu of cash) compensation program for key executive officers and board members, the Company is announcing the issuance of 750,000 in options and 650,000 RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) with a strike price of 0.41 cents CDN which represents a premium to the prior day closing price from the Board\u2019s approval of such compensation approval for Ms. Venator and contemporaneously has approved a zero cash and DSU (Deferred Stock Compensation) for Board Members collectively of 545,000 DSUs. The Company notes that all such options, RSUs and DSUs are coming from the existing equity incentive plan and represent just over 1 percent of the fully diluted ownership of the Company.\nAbout MiniLuxe\nMiniLuxe, a Delaware corporation based in Boston, Massachusetts.

      "text": "Posthaste: Canada suffering 'major capital drain' as foreign investors go MIA\nEconomist says outflow of funds from Canadian economy since January is 'unprecedented'\nThe latest tally of international securities transactions is out this week, and it\u2019s not a pretty picture for Canada.\nForeign investors added $709 million in Canadian securities in June, the first investment since January, and while that might seem like good news, National Bank of Canada economist Warren Lovely says Canadians should hold their applause.\nThe \u201cslight\u201d June investment reversed just a fraction of the divestment that has been accumulating since the beginning of the year.\n\u201cSince President Trump moved back into the White House and clouds formed over many an outlook, non-residents have cooled on Canadian exposure,\u201d he wrote in a note on the data. \u201cNever has the first half of a calendar year produced such tepid foreign interest.\u201d\nForeign investors bought $6.9 billion in Canadian bonds in June, down from $9.7 billion in May. Corporate bond purchases led the way, followed by provincial government bonds. There was a $1.3 billion reduction in foreign holdings of federal government bonds.\nBut they dumped equities. Foreign investors reduced their exposure to Canadian shares by $3 billion in June, following a divestment of $11.5 billion in May. Most of this was in the banking sector and trade and transportation industries.\nMeanwhile, Canadians acquired $9 billion in foreign securities, most of it in U.S. stocks and non-U.S. bonds. This resulted in a $8.3 billion outflow from the Canadian economy in the month and brought the total exit for the second quarter to $43.7 billion, said Statistics Canada. There was a similar outflow in the first quarter.\n\u201cWith nonresident investors aloof and Canadians adding foreign assets, the country has suffered a major capital drain. The cumulative outflow over the latest five-month period is in fact unprecedented,\u201d said Lovely.\n- Never mind the mortgage cliff, this is the debt Canadians are really struggling with\n- Why Trump might have to cut tariffs \u2014 (spoiler, they're not working)\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nThe economist said Canada\u2019s bond market especially needs scrutiny, considering the heightened borrowing needs of the federal government in the days to come.\nIn 2024, foreign buying soaked up almost 75 per cent of net Government of Canada debt issuance, but that share dropped dramatically in the first half of this year.\nDomestic investors were left to pick up the slack, acquiring $100 billion of net GoC supply in the first half, said National. Annualized, that\u2019s 6 per cent of GDP and doesn\u2019t include the funding needs of non-central governments, public sector entities and private corporations.\n\u201cIf sustained, foreign investor apathy could be problematic if not downright frightful,\u201d said Lovely.\nIf Ottawa wants to avoid a worse scenario, clarity on its budget and a timely trade deal would help, he said.\nSign up here to get Posthaste delivered straight to your inbox.\nChina Customs, according to a recent report, cites gold \u2014 not canola or coal \u2014 as its No. 1 import from Canada by value, and today\u2019s chart shows how the yellow metal has become a bigger player in the nation\u2019s trade. Gold and other precious metals are now more than 6 per cent of Canadian exports, double the share two years ago, said Douglas Porter, chief economist of BMO Capital Markets.\nThat puts precious metals in line with forestry products such as lumber and pulp & paper, which has long topped Canadian trade, and farm and fishing.\n- Central bankers gather for the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, in Wyoming\n- Federal Agriculture Minister Heath MacDonald and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe will hold a press conference this afternoon after meeting about Chinese tariffs of 75.8 per cent on Canadian canola\n- Today\u2019s Data: Canada industrial product and raw materials price indices, United States existing home sales\n- Earnings: Walmart Inc., Intuit Inc., Ross Stores Inc., Workday Inc.\nBuying a house is the largest purchase most Canadians will ever make and finally paying off the mortgage is likely to be a game changer.\nBut before the temptation to splurge on a pricey new car or a luxury vacation takes hold, experts say it\u2019s important to review your financial plan for this next chapter to ensure you\u2019re on track for wherever you want to go.

Postmedia may earn an affiliate commission from purchases made through links on this page.\nCanada\u2019s trade with the United States will force the closure of nearly 40 per cent of Canadian small businesses within a year without changes in the tariff rates between the two countries, according to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB).\nThe CFIB on Wednesday also said 19 per cent of small businesses won\u2019t last another six months under current conditions, with 62 per cent of them dealing with higher expenses and 48 per cent facing lower revenue.\n\u201cSmall businesses don\u2019t have a lot of runway left,\u201d Corinne Pohlmann, executive vice-president of advocacy at CFIB, said in a release. \u201cThey are trying their best to absorb the costs, but if nothing changes, they will be forced to make some tough decisions. The worst outcome for Canada in the trade war is a bad deal, but the second-worst outcome is the never-ending uncertainty small business owners have been wrestling with for the past six months.\u201d\nEarlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump hiked tariffs on Canadian imports to 35 per cent on products not covered under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA).\nThe U.S. has also imposed a 50 per cent levy on steel, aluminum and copper, and Trump has threatened tariffs on pharmaceuticals.\nTrump has also pledged to remove the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption on Aug. 29, which allows parcels valued at less than US$800 to cross the border tariff-free.\nMeanwhile, Canada\u2019s canola industry is facing 76 per cent tariffs from China.\nThe CFIB said the tariffs on metal are hurting 59 per cent of Canadian small businesses, retaliatory tariffs are causing problems for 58 per cent of them and nearly losing the de minimis exemption could hurt a third.\nIn response to the latest U.S. tariff hike, Prime Minister Mark Carney offered a $1.2-billion aid package to the lumber industry and suggested lowering counter tariffs.\n- Carbon rebates for small businesses won't be taxed\n- CFIB to work with feds in dealing with tariff battle\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\n\u201cWe look at what we can do for our industry that\u2019s most effective,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cIn some cases, that will be to remove tariffs.\u201d\nBut the CFIB is pushing for more support measures to help Canadian businesses.\n\u201cThe federal government needs to provide some stability and return tariff revenue to help small businesses,\u201d Pohlmann said. \u201cWe\u2019ve suggested several options, including temporarily reducing the federal small business tax rate to zero or a tariff rebate designed on earlier models, like the carbon tax rebate.\u201d\nThe Liberals during the election campaign projected that counter tariffs would bring in $20 million in revenue within 12 months, though the situation can rapidly change.\nThe CFIB is pushing for all tariff revenues to be sent to affected businesses.\n\u201cIf the government wants to build one Canadian economy, it needs to ensure small businesses are part of the solution and that includes providing them with tariff support during this very challenging time,\u201d Pohlmann said.\n\u2022 Email: bcousins@postmedia.com\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "Safe as houses? How Canada's ailing housing market could spell trouble for the whole economy\nReal estate is not only a major source of wealth for Canadians, it's also one of the country's top economic drivers. Jordan Gowling looks at how one of the worst housing markets in decades could drag on jobs, government revenues and the stability of the financial system\nArticle content\nHolly Calderwood has worked in the Vancouver real estate industry for two decades, and there\u2019s only been a handful of times when she has seen the housing market this bad.\n\u201cI think the last time I saw this was in 2008-2009 during the financial crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in 2020 during COVID-19.\u201d\nCalderwood has built a career specializing in selling luxury real estate from condos to waterfront properties, and she has recently noticed both a decline in sales and prices, as well as a rise in foreclosures.\n\u201cIt really picked up last year, but this year, too,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of foreclosures and then you just see the price dropping. Sometimes people are losing a couple of million.\u201d\nCalderwood attributes the causes for that trend to homeowners renewing at higher interest rates, a foreign buyer ban and a trade war with the United States that has put a damper on investment sentiment and demand.\nEconomists and industry insiders say some markets have entered a buyer\u2019s market for the first time in years, with cities such as Toronto, Vancouver and even Calgary recording significant drops in sales activity and posting record highs in inventory.\nThat could be a sign of price bubbles bursting, which is welcome news for would-be buyers, but could also spell trouble for the Canadian economy, which has relied on housing in recent years as an important economic driver, and it could lead to a drag on jobs, government revenues and the stability of the financial system.\nThe housing market recently peaked in mid-2022, before it started declining as the Bank of Canada began raising interest rates to deal with post-pandemic inflation. Earlier this year, the industry was hoping the market would begin a slow recovery after the central bank began delivering rate relief in 2024. Data from June and July seem to suggest a pickup in activity, but prices and sales are down compared to last year.\nRobert Hogue, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, projects home resales will decline 3.5 per cent in Canada to 467,100 units in 2025, with the drop largely concentrated in Ontario and British Columbia.\nTrade uncertainty and general worries about the Canadian economy have been blamed for the slowdown, but some markets have also become unaffordable for many buyers.\n\u201cWe have had a structural shift in interest rates,\u201d Charles St-Arnaud, chief economist at Alberta Central, said. \u201cThat changed the affordability equation quite significantly for many markets.\u201d\nHe said mortgage rates are 150 basis points higher than they were in the decade before the pandemic and that has left a lot of would-be buyers not being able to afford what they thought they could afford.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve been seeing prices going nowhere; no one can afford to overbid for a house in aggregate,\u201d he said.\nBy the numbers\nSome politicians like to talk about lowering housing market prices as a social good, but housing and real estate investments remain a key economic driver for Canada and investors need to know they\u2019ll get a return on their money.\nIn May, Canada\u2019s newly appointed Housing Minister Gregor Robertson said the quiet part out loud when he was asked whether house prices should go down.\n\u201cNo, I think that we need to deliver more supply, make sure the market is stable,\u201d he said during a scrum on Parliament Hill. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge part of our economy.\u201d\nLast year alone, the housing sector contributed $143.4 billion to the economy and supported 1.2 million jobs. Someone buying a home often translates into spin-off consumption in other areas of the economy, such as household appliances, renovation services and materials.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve often heard the saying in the U.S. that when the housing market is doing well, the general economy is doing well,\u201d St-Arnaud said. \u201cStrong housing starts, strong building construction, have a lot of spillover to the rest of the economy.\u201d\nResidential investment contributed 10 per cent to Canada\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2021 during the pandemic housing boom and 7.5 per cent in 2023. The total value of housing assets grew to $4.2 trillion last year, representing 25 per cent of national wealth.\nThe total residential dollar value of all homes sold in Canada in June was $33.1 billion, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association, compared to $25.1 billion in June 2019, which represents a 24 per cent increase in six years. This has been helped by an increase in the average home price, which climbed to $691,634 in June from $505,500 in June 2019.\nMike Moffatt, an economist and founding director of the Missing Middle Initiative at the University of Ottawa, said governments are trying to achieve two things at once: restore affordability while also maintaining an environment that encourages confidence in the market and developers to keep building.\n\u201cThe governments are trying to do two things that are, on the face of it, inherently contradictory,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do need prices to fall. But we\u2019ve seen over the last three years what happens when prices continue falling. It basically just breaks the economics for builders by eliminating the incentive to build. That creates a challenging situation where we want low prices, but we also want to create the conditions for builders to build more.\u201d\nMoffatt said all levels of government benefit from housing development, often through development charges, HST/GST and other fees.\nBut cracks are starting to show in this industry. The condo markets in Ontario and British Columbia have experienced significant losses in pricing value, with signs of financial distress in the sector. What used to be an attractive area for investors to park their money is no longer the case.\nCondo apartment sales have dropped by 75 per cent in the Greater Toronto Area and 37 per cent in Vancouver since the pandemic peak in 2022, according to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC).\n\u201cThe story of the dog-crate condominiums is well understood here in Toronto and in downtown Vancouver,\u201d Ron Butler, a mortgage broker and host of the Angry Mortgage Podcast, said.\nHe said buyers who bought at preposterous prices five years ago, particularly in the pre-construction condo market, will not be able to see a return on their investment. Even worse, a number of condo projects in Canada\u2019s two largest cities have entered receivership or been cancelled over the last two years.\nOne reason for the industry\u2019s decline is that Canada\u2019s population growth slowed to a crawl at the beginning of this year after several years of record-breaking growth in immigration. Some economists credited the previous surge in newcomers for masking the underlying weaknesses in the economy coming out of the pandemic as well as for keeping housing demand high in urban centres.\nButler said a combination of immigration curbs introduced last fall by the federal government and an increased number of for-purpose rentals entering the market are now the biggest contributors to a decline in rental prices.\n\u201cYou literally couldn\u2019t imagine a worse set of circumstances (for these investors),\u201d he said.\nCondo prices in Toronto\u2019s surrounding suburbs are recording even more significant drops than in the city itself, according to a recent report by Moody Analytics. For example, prices in Halton Hills have fallen by as much as 50 per cent from their peak.\nPrices are dropping elsewhere, too. The average national price of a one-bedroom rental unit in Canada decreased 3.6 per cent year over year to $1,857 in May 2025, according to the latest National Rent Report by Rentals.ca and Urbanation Inc.\n\u201cOdds are that rent is probably going to continue falling over the near term, so I wouldn\u2019t expect investors to make their way back anytime soon,\u201d Hogue said.\nHe said the 10 per cent decline from the peak prices in the Toronto area is significant, but it has not completely reversed the price run-up experienced during the pandemic.\n\u201cA 10 per cent price decline historically would have been very significant and a big correction,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after the period we have gone through, it\u2019s only reversing a small fraction of the price increase we saw during the pandemic.\u201d\nTiming and speculation\nInvestor speculation in the real estate industry has often been a point of criticism from housing advocates. Butler said today\u2019s condo market debacle is what happens when you build a product solely around the priorities of investors instead of homeowners since it can lead to an oversupply of a product no one wants or can afford.\n\u201cThe model of building high-rise condos is that you have to sell 75 per cent of the building on a presale basis, with people who will give you 20 per cent down,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst of all, a lot of first-time homebuyers don\u2019t have the 20 per cent or need to come by it slowly, and, secondly, most of the 75 per cent of presales were comprised of investors.\u201d\nInvestor participation in the real estate market has also been criticized for turning housing into an asset and for taking capital away from other productive parts of the economy. Canada\u2019s lagging business investment and productivity are longstanding issues.\nBut many regular homeowners often use their houses as a funding source for retirement or it may be the only major asset they own.\n\u201cWe can think about the boomers who are sitting on big appreciation in their house values, but we can also think of recent buyers who probably overstretched themselves to get on the market,\u201d St-Arnaud said. \u201cHow do we deal with that if in 25 years they have zero appreciation on their main asset and they can\u2019t save for anything else?\u201d\nWhile this price adjustment is happening in the condo market, it is also happening in the house market in certain regions in Southern Ontario and British Columbia.\nBut not all regions are equal, since housing markets in the Prairies and Quebec are showing some resilience.\n\u201cThe Quebec market seems to be on a sustained gradual upward movement,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a reflection of the fact that it\u2019s just not badly priced.\u201d\nBut once fast-growing markets such as Calgary are also facing more buyer-friendly conditions for the first time in years, though conditions are not as bad as they are for sellers in Vancouver and Toronto.\nJustin Warthe, a realtor and real estate investor in Calgary, said the city\u2019s benchmark prices rose above $700,000 during the 2022-2023 peak from the mid-$500,000 range in 2020. The market has cooled since mid-2023, when interest rates rose, and the market has returned to having more than three months of inventory.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely more of a buyer\u2019s market right now,\u201d he said.\nWarthe said he has to sit some clients down who think their houses will sell overnight and tell them that\u2019s not the reality anymore.\nStill, despite this softening in some markets, St-Arnaud said Canada\u2019s housing remains the most expensive in the G7.\n\u201cHouse prices are still 26 per cent above where they were pre-COVID,\u201d he said.\nTo get into the market, Canadians have heavily leveraged themselves, with residential mortgage debt reaching $2.3 trillion in February this year, compared to $1.6 trillion in 2019. Nearly half of all lending by Canadian banks is for residential mortgages.\nThe increase in mortgages has led to an increase in household debt, though Canada\u2019s current debt-to-disposable-income ratio at 173 per cent is a slight decline from the 179 per cent reported in 2024.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the highest in the G20,\u201d St-Arnaud said. \u201cHow much more debt do we want our households to take? How much more vulnerability?\u201d\nThe worst-case scenario for mortgage renewals if a longstanding global trade war leads to higher unemployment and depleted house prices was laid out by the Bank of Canada in its financial stability report in May.\n\u201cResults suggest that the share of mortgages in arrears by at least 90 days could rise to a level comparable with or higher than levels reached in the 2008-09 global financial crisis,\u201d the central bank said.\nThis is, of course, the most severe scenario policymakers worked out and does not represent a likely eventuality.\nAbout 60 per cent of mortgages in Canada will renew in 2025 or 2026, with 60 per cent of those mortgage holders expected to see an increase in their payments. That said, many of those mortgage holders are expected to be able to handle the higher payments.\nBut, as many economists have noted, the mortgage renewal risk will only be contained if the labour market holds. The unemployment rate held steady at 6.9 per cent in July, but Statistics Canada said net employment has only increased by 27,000 since the beginning of the year.\n\u201cA chief risk officer will tell you the three most important things about mortgage default, it\u2019s unemployment, unemployment and unemployment,\u201d said Butler.\nFor now, the weakness has been driven by slow hiring, not layoffs, and recent GDP data suggests economic growth has merely flatlined in the second quarter, so the country has not entered a contraction.\n\u201cAs long as there are no job losses, as long as people still have an income, we\u2019ll be OK,\u201d St-Arnaud said. \u201cIf there is a negative shock, if there is a recession and we start to see relatively big layoffs, I would be really concerned for the housing market and the ramifications to the broader economy.\u201d\nBut the unemployment rate is rising in many places. For example, the jobless rate hit 7.9 per cent in Ontario in July and increased to 5.9 per cent in British Columbia. The construction industry led the way, with employment down 22,000 positions in July after five consecutive months of little change in the sector, according to Statistics Canada\u2019s latest release.\nThe stalling economy seems to be affecting homebuilders. CMHC forecasts that housing starts will come in at 237,800 in 2025, down from 245,367 in 2024. The Crown corporation also forecasts 227,734 housing starts next year and 220,016 in 2027. Those figures are all well below the 430,000 to 480,000 new homes per year it said are needed to restore affordability to 2019 levels.\n\u201cWe are seeing the most expensive markets experiencing a price decline,\u201d Moffatt said. \u201cAnd because of it, new home sales have basically evaporated in those two markets.\u201d\nCalderwood said developers are dealing with tariff-related cost increases and the new-build market has considerably slowed.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had builders contact me and say it\u2019s the slowest they have ever seen it,\u201d she said.\nMoffatt said this slowdown will only exacerbate the supply issue. It may be hard to imagine now, but that lack of supply could fuel another bubble in pricing by the end of the decade.\n\u201cIf we go through a period where nothing gets built and then the economy improves, we\u2019re not going to have a lot of inventory once people are ready to buy again,\u201d he said.\nButler said the supply of homes that people want to buy will remain constrained for the foreseeable future.\n\u201cThe undersupply is in first-time, low-rise homes for people to buy, whether they\u2019re single-family, townhouses or semis,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that particular area, in Ontario and British Columbia, building of that product collapsed 16 months ago.\u201d\nThe CMHC expects the average house price to drop by two per cent this year, with a slow recovery starting in 2026 as trade tensions ease and economic conditions improve.\nCalderwood said markets can quickly change, but she remains pessimistic that things will improve.\n\u201cA lot of realtors say they can predict the market, but we\u2019re not psychics,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as Trump is in power and with that all the tariffs and chaos, I don\u2019t see it trending upward.\u201d\n\u2022 Email: jgowling@postmedia.com\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "CRA penalizes taxpayer for failure to report the sale of residential real estate\nJamie Golombek: Taxpayer failed to report capital gain of $159,282 and the CRA also hit him with a $21,000 gross negligence penalty\nReviews and recommendations are unbiased and products are independently selected. Postmedia may earn an affiliate commission from purchases made through links on this page.\nPerhaps the biggest tax break remaining for ordinary Canadians is the principal residence exemption (PRE), which allows individuals to realize an unlimited tax-free gain upon the sale of their home. Contrast that to the U.S. where the exemption is currently limited to US$250,000 for single filers (US$500,000 for married couples filing jointly), although last month, a bill was introduced in the U.S. that would provide an unlimited exemption just like in Canada.\nUnder our tax rules, if you do sell your principal residence, as of 2016 you need to report that sale on your tax return even if it fully qualifies for the PRE. The designation of your principal residence is reported on the front page of Schedule 3 of your return, and you must also complete the appropriate sections of Form T2091(IND), Designation of a Property as a Principal Residence by an Individual.\nFor a property to qualify as your principal residence for a particular tax year, four criteria must be satisfied: 1. the property must be a housing unit; 2. you must own the property (either alone or jointly with someone else); 3. you or your spouse (or common-law partner) or kids must \u201cordinarily inhabit\u201d the property and 4. you must \u201cdesignate\u201d the property as a principal residence.\nNote that a seasonal residence, such as a cottage, cabin, lake house or even ski chalet, can be considered to be \u201cordinarily inhabited in the year\u201d even if you only use it during vacation periods \u201cprovided that the main reason for owning the property is not to gain or produce income.\u201d\nA rental property, however, is generally not considered a principal residence, and you could be on the hook for capital gains tax when you sell it. Similarly, you may be precluded from claiming the PRE if you bought or built a home with the purpose of selling it for a profit.\nIn recent years the government has been cracking down on residential house flipping. New anti-flipping rules for residential real estate (including rental properties) came into effect Jan. 1, 2023, and were designed to \u201creduce speculative demand in the marketplace and help to cool excessive price growth.\u201d\n- CRA loses case as judge rules in favour of taxpayers' Home Buyers' Plan withdrawal timing\n- CRA prevails over Holt Renfrew saleswoman in battle over wardrobe deduction\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nThe rules prevent you from claiming the PRE to shelter the capital gain realized on the sale of your home if you\u2019ve owned it for less than 12 months. And, any gain on the sale of residential real estate held under 12 months is taxable not as a 50 per cent capital gain, but rather as 100 per cent taxable business income, subject to certain exemptions for life events such as death, disability, separation and work relocation.\nIf you sold residential real estate (including a rental property) that you owned for less than 365 days, you are obligated to declare that sale on Part 2 of the Schedule 3 of your personal tax return for the year of sale.\nAnd, although the flipped property rules only came into play for 2023 and future years, the Canada Revenue Agency can still challenge real estate flips that took place prior to 2023 if it feels a taxpayer has speculated and flipped a property for a quick profit.\nIn recent years, the CRA has also been cracking down on perceived abuse of the PRE even when properties are held for more than a year. Take the recent decision of the Tax Court, decided in June 2025, involving a Toronto taxpayer whose 2016 tax return was reassessed by the CRA because he failed to report a capital gain of $159,282 on the sale of residential real estate. To make matters worse, he was also hit with a $21,000 gross negligence penalty for failure to report the gain.\nThe taxpayer, an avid investor who was \u201cparticularly fond of real property,\u201d purchased several properties along a certain portion of Toronto\u2019s Yonge Street between 2010 and 2017. In 2016, the taxpayer sold multiple real estate holdings.\nOne of these properties was his principal residence in which he lived from May 2010 to July 2016. The CRA allowed him to claim the PRE on the sale of this property even though he failed to report its disposition on his 2016 tax return.\nThe taxpayer also failed to report the disposition of a second property sold at a gain in 2016, claiming that it was \u201calways intended as a principal residence.\u201d This claim was rejected by the CRA for a variety of reasons, including the fact he never resided at the property, did not file a T2091 to report it and already had a different principal residence at the same time in the same taxation year.\nUnfortunately, this was not the first time the taxpayer failed to report a disposition of real estate. It turns out that in 2011 the taxpayer was also reassessed, penalized and \u201cred flagged for future vigilance by the (CRA)\u201d for failure to report a sale.\nIn his defense, the taxpayer claimed that he reviewed his 2016 tax return with his accountant, reported the disposition of two other properties he sold in 2016, but omitted the gain on his principal residence and the property in question, believing that the gains were sheltered by the PRE.\nThe taxpayer blamed his accountant for failing to disclose the sale of his principal residence since 2016 was the first year this was required and his \u201caccountant likely was ignorant\u201d of the need to report it. When asked why his accountant didn\u2019t testify, the taxpayer said it was because he had \u201cmoved to the States.\u201d\nBut the judge wasn\u2019t buying this excuse, noting that the taxpayer had a master\u2019s degree, was experienced in real estate and even became a licensed real estate broker in 2022. The judge upheld the CRA\u2019s assessment of the unreported gain.\nThe judge also concluded that in failing to report any disposition from the sale of the property, the taxpayer \u201cknowingly or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence\u201d made a false statement or omission on his 2016 tax return. Consequently, the CRA was justified in levying a gross negligence penalty for failure to report the gain associated with the sale of the property.\nJamie Golombek, FCPA, FCA, CFP, CLU, TEP, is the managing director, Tax & Estate Planning with CIBC Private Wealth in Toronto.

      "text": "Posthaste: Never mind the mortgage cliff, this is the debt Canadians are really struggling with\nClose to 1.4 million Canadians missed a credit payment in the second quarter\nRemember those warnings about Canadians falling off the mortgage cliff when the rock-bottom borrowing of the pandemic came up for renewal at much higher rates.\nThat cliff turned out to be of more of a \u201ccurb\u201d as one observer put it, and the people who are struggling the most with debt these days, according to the latest surveys, don\u2019t even have a mortgage.\nAn Equifax Canada report out this week found that close to 1.4 million Canadians missed a credit payment in the second quarter. That\u2019s actually down a touch since the first quarter, but still 118,000 higher than a year ago.\nHowever, the number of people who missed a payment who don\u2019t have a mortgage are nearly double the number who do.\n\u201cWhile the overall delinquency rate appears to be levelling off, the underlying story is far more complex,\u201d said Rebecca Oakes, vice president of advanced analytics at Equifax Canada.\n\u201cWe continue to see a growing divide between mortgage and non-mortgage consumers \u2014 and continued financial strain among younger Canadians, who are facing a slower job market and rising costs.\u201d\nCanadians under 36 appear to be facing the most financial difficulties. The delinquency rate for this age group jumped almost 20 per cent from a year ago and average non-mortgage debt rose to $14,304.\n\u201cThis demographic is currently reporting some of the highest delinquency levels for both credit cards and auto loans,\u201d said the study.\nEquifax says spending levels have increased among those without a mortgage, while homeowners spent less on their credit cards.\nCredit card balances hit a record $113.3 billion in June, according to data released by Statistics Canada yesterday, and total non-mortgage credit liabilities reached $793 billion, up $29 billion from the year before.\nThe Credit Counselling Society said the Canadians reaching out to its service for help are now carrying bigger debt loads. The average unsecured debt load rose to $34,400 in June, up 14 per cent from last year.\n- Why Trump might have to cut tariffs \u2014 (spoiler, they're not working)\n- Canadians overlooking 'wonderful buy-and-hold stocks that are in plain sight'\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\n\u201cThe affordability crisis seems to be hitting younger consumers the hardest,\u201d said Oakes. \u201cBetween rising costs, employment uncertainty, and limited access to affordable credit, many are struggling just to stay afloat.\u201d\nOntario, especially the Great Toronto Area and Hamilton, showed the sharpest increases in missed payments in the country. Equifax says this reflects the high cost of living in these regions and exposure to the auto and steel industries which are now being hit by U.S. tariffs.\nDelinquency rates also rose in Alberta, where people without a mortgage are showing greater financial stress than their neighbours with mortgages, said Oakes.\nEquifax expects credit performance to remain a key issue for young consumers well into the second half of the year.\nSign up here to get Posthaste delivered straight to your inbox.\nHousing starts in Canada jumped to 294,000 in July, beating economic forecasts. The gains were driven by multi-unit construction, while single-family housing starts remained flat.\nThe biggest building boom is in Montreal where housing starts are up 50 per cent year to date over last year, said Kari Norman, an economist with Desjardins Group. It is even overtaking Toronto, where housing starts are half what they were last year.\nThis is the fourth straight month of gains, but the outlook for housing starts remains unclear, especially since there is \u201csignificant excess supply\u201d of already built multi-unit apartments, said Norman.\n\u201cWithout enough presales, developers may not be able to obtain funding to move projects forward,\u201d he said.\n- Natural Resources Minister Tim Hodgson will make an announcement on innovation in the nuclear sector in Kincardine, Ont.\n- Today\u2019s Data: Canada inflation, United States housing starts, building permits\n- Earnings: Home Depot Inc.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s hard to buy, it\u2019s going to be hard to sell\u201d \u2014 Investing pro Martin Pelletier has a cautionary tale about trying to sell his Maserati and the message is the same advice applies to low-volume stocks or private businesses operating in niche markets.\nWhile these investments looks good on paper it can be difficult to sell without taking a significant discount, especially if a quick sale is needed or if market sentiment shifts.\nWhether you\u2019re buying a rare car, a microcap stock or a stake in a private company, these are the principles you should follow.
