  "description": "The design for a 36 mile long spacecraft, called Chrysalis, includes libraries, tropical forests and structural manufacturing facilities, all supported by artificial gravity.",
  "content": "Chrysalis could house several generations until it enters Alpha Centauri, where it could shuttle people to the surface of the planet Proxima Centuri b.\n\nEngineers have designed a spacecraft that could take up to 2,400 people on a one-way trip to Alpha Centauri, the star system closest to our own. The craft, called Chrysalis, could make the 25 trillion mile (40 trillion kilometer) journey in around 400 years, the engineers say in their , meaning many of its potential passengers would only know life on the craft.\n\nChrysalis is designed to house several generations of people until it enters the star system, where it could shuttle them to the surface of the planet \u2014 an Earth-size exoplanet that is thought to be potentially habitable.\n\nThe project won first place in the , a challenge that requires teams to design hypothetical multigenerational ships for interstellar travel.\n\nBefore boarding the ship, the Chrysalis project would require initial generations of ship inhabitants to live in and adapt to an isolated environment in Antarctica for 70 to 80 years to ensure psychological wellbeing. The ship could theoretically be constructed in 20 to 25 years and .\n\nThe vessel, which would measure 36 miles (58 km) in length, would be constructed like a Russian nesting doll, with several layers encompassing each other around a central core. The layers include communal spaces, farms, gardens, homes, warehouses and other shared facilities, each powered by .\n\nThe core in the center of the vehicle hosts the shuttles that could bring people to Proxima Centuri b, as well as all of Chrysalis' communication equipment.\n\nRelated: Will we ever reach Alpha Centauri, our closest neighboring star system?\n\nThe layer closest to Chrysalis' core is dedicated to food production, nurturing plants, fungi, microbes, insects and livestock in controlled environments. To preserve biodiversity, different environments including tropical and boreal forests would be maintained.\n\nThe second level from the center provides communal spaces, like parks, schools, hospitals and libraries, for the ship\u2019s inhabitants. The next shell would then hold dwellings for individual households, equipped with air circulation and heat exchangers.\n\nWork happens on the next level up, where there are facilities for industries ranging from recycling to pharmaceuticals to structural manufacturing. The fifth and outermost shell would serve as a warehouse for varied types of resources, materials, equipment and machinery. The Chrysalis' designers suggest that robots could run this level, reducing the need for human physical labor.\n\nBirths would be planned in Chrysalis to ensure the population stays at a sustainable level, which the research team determined to be about 1,500 people \u2014 900 people less than the ship's total capacity.\n\nThose responsible for the ship's governance would collaborate with , \"allowing for resilience of the whole social system, better knowledge transfer between the different generations of inhabitants and a deeper vision of the overall dynamics of the Chrysalis spaceship complex,\" the project engineers wrote in their pitch.\n\nThis plan is purely hypothetical, as some of the required technology, like commercial nuclear fusion reactors, don't yet exist. However, hypothetical projects like this one can still add to our existing knowledge base and help engineers improve upcoming designs.\n\nThe Project Hyperion jury wrote on its website that Chrysalis was impressive for its \"system-level coherence and innovative design of the modular habitat structure\" and \"overall depth of detail.\" The winning team of five researchers was awarded $5,000 USD.\n\nHuman spaceflight quiz: How well do you know our journey into space?",

      "text": "Just a cosmic hop, skip and jump away, an Earth-size planet orbits the closest star to our sun, Proxima Centauri.\nEver since the discovery of the exoplanet \u2014 known as Proxima Centauri b\u2014 in 2016, people have wondered whether it could be capable of sustaining life.\nNow, using computer models similar to those used to study climate change on Earth, researchers have found that, under a wide range of conditions, Proxima Centauri b can sustain enormous areas of liquid water on its surface, potentially raising its prospects for harboring living organisms. [9 Strange, Scientific Excuses for Why Humans Haven't Found Aliens Yet]\n\"The major message from our simulations is that there's a decent chance that the planet would be habitable,\" said Anthony Del Genio, a planetary scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City. Del Genio is also the lead author of a paper describing the new research, which was published Sept. 5 in the journal Astrobiology.\nProxima Centauri is a small, cool red-dwarf star located just 4.2 light-years from the sun. Despite its proximity, scientists still know very little about Proxima Centauri's planetary companion, besides that its mass is at least 1.3 times that of Earth and that it goes around its parent starevery 11 days. Therefore, Del Genio and his colleagues had to make some reasonable guesses about the exoplanet Proxima Centauri b \u2014 namely, that it had an atmosphere and an ocean on its surface \u2014 for their work to proceed.\nProxima Centauri b orbits in its star's habitable zone, meaning it's at just the right distance to receive enough starlight to keep its surface above the freezing temperature of water. But this zone is extremely close to the star, Space.com, a Live Science sister site, reported. So it's likely that the planet has become tidally locked due to gravitational forces. This means that the same side of Proxima Centauri b always faces its parent star, much like how the moon always shows the same side to Earth.\nPrevious simulations published in a 2016 paper in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysicsmodeled a hypothetical atmosphere on Proxima Centauri b and suggested that the star-facing hemisphere of the exoplanet might be baked under an intense glare, while a space-facing ocean would be frozen over. Therefore, only a circle of warm sea might exist on Proxima Centauri b \u2014 a scenario Del Genio's team calls \"eyeball Earth.\"\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nBut the new simulations were more comprehensive than prior ones; they also included a dynamic, circulating ocean, which was able to transfer heat from one side of the exoplanet to the other very effectively. In the researchers' findings, the movement of the atmosphere and ocean combined so that \"even though the night side never sees any starlight, there's a band of liquid water that's sustained around the equatorial region,\" Del Genio told Live Science.\nHe likened this heat circulation to our own planet's seaside climates. The U.S. East Coast is balmier than it would be otherwise, he said, because the Gulf Stream carries warm water up from the tropics. In California, by contrast, ocean currents bring cold water down from the North, and the West Coast is colder than it otherwise would be, Del Genio added.\nThe team ran 18 separate simulation scenarios in total, looking at the effects of giant continents, thin atmospheres, different atmospheric compositions and even changes in the amount of salt in the global ocean. In almost all of the models, Proxima Centauri b ended up having open ocean that persisted over at least some part of its surface.\n\"The larger the fraction of the planet with liquid water, the better the odds that if there's life there, we can find evidence of that life with future telescopes,\" Del Genio said.\nRavi Kopparapu, a geoscientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who was not involved in the study, agreed.\n\"I think it's exciting that some of these climate outcomes can be observed,\" Kopparapu told Live Science. Next-generation facilities, such as the Extremely Large Telescope currently under construction in Chile, might be able to witness heat coming off Proxima Centauri b and differentiate its possible surface conditions, he added.\nOriginally published on Live Science.\nAdam Mann is a freelance journalist with over a decade of experience, specializing in astronomy and physics stories.

      "text": "Here's every spaceship that's ever carried an astronaut into orbit\nSpaceX's Crew Dragon could become #9.\nThe hundreds of people who have been to space have traveled on just a handful of vehicles, eight in all over nearly six decades of spaceflight.\nSoon, a ninth will take flight, as SpaceX's Crew Dragon is scheduled to blast off from Florida on May 30 (after a delay due to bad weather) carrying two NASA astronauts in a test mission to the International Space Station. Four crewed vehicles to date have been American spacecraft, a point NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine emphasized in remarks made during a May 1 news conference about the upcoming SpaceX launch, called Demo-2.\n\"We think about Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and then space shuttle: Those are really the four times in history where we have put humans on brand-new spacecraft, and now we're doing it for a fifth time,\" Bridenstine said. \"It's been a long time since we put humans on a brand-new spacecraft, but that's what this is.\"\nLet's take a spin through the company Crew Dragon will join.\nRelated: The history of rockets\nVostok (USSR, 1961)\nThe Vostok capsule carried the first-ever human to make a spaceflight, the Soviet Union's cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, who launched on April 12, 1961 and clocked in with just over one full orbit of Earth.\nVostok could carry just one astronaut in its main spherical cabin, which perched atop a belt of life-support gas tanks and a pyramidical instrument module that was jettisoned before the cabin reentered Earth's atmosphere. A window near the astronaut's feet allowed them to observe Earth during flight.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nThe capsule had no landing gear; instead, Gagarin and his successors ejected from the capsule during the reentry process, although the Soviet Union hid that fact lest the mission not be considered a true spaceflight.\nVostok translates as \"East;\" Gagarin's capsule went by the call sign Swallow, according to NASA. Six Vostok capsules in all carried cosmonauts to orbit between 1961 and 1963; the capsule's final flight carried Valentina Tereshkova, who became the first woman in space.\nRelated: Yuri Gagarin, first man in space (photo gallery)\nMercury (US, 1961)\nDuring the Cold War space race, the U.S. strove to beat the Soviet Union's Vostok capsule with its own crewed vehicle in Project Mercury.\nThe Soviet Union met the milestone first with Gagarin's flight; three weeks later, the U.S. launched astronaut Alan Shepard on a suborbital flight aboard the Freedom 7 capsule. A crewed Mercury vehicle didn't reach orbit until John Glenn's flight in February 1962 aboard the Friendship 7 capsule.\nMercury capsules were approximately conical, with a cylindrical segment interrupting the cone's sides. When on the ground or atop a rocket, the cone stood upright and the astronaut lay on his back near the bottom; in orbit, the capsule rotated to seat the astronaut upright with a window panel more or less at eye level. The capsule's heat shield was at the astronaut's back, along the circular base of the cone.\nUnusually, Mercury capsules had individual names beyond the series itself; others included Liberty Bell 7, Sigma 7 and Aurora 7. The final crewed Mercury capsule flew in 1963.\nRelated: Project Mercury: NASA's 1st crewed spaceflights in photos\nVoskhod (USSR, 1964)\nThe Voskhod capsule was based heavily on the design of Vostok but adapted to carry more crewmembers, and later to facilitate spacewalking, the next milestone achievement the USSR had set its sights on.\nFirst, the USSR needed to squeeze multiple crewmembers into the small capsule. To accomplish that, spacecraft engineers ditched the ejection seat and replaced it with stable couches and a landing system, according to NASA. Voskhod first carried humans in 1964, launching with a crew of three: a pilot, a medical doctor and a spacecraft engineer. To accommodate the tight conditions, the trio did not wear space suits.\nA second version of the Voskhod capsule was adapted for a spacewalk, carrying an inflatable airlock. The USSR flew an uncrewed test mission for the vehicle, then in 1965 launched Voskhod 2, which carried two cosmonauts in pressure suits on a 26-hour flight. One of those cosmonauts, Alexei Leonov, exited the inflatable airlock and spent about 12 minutes in space, clinching the accomplishment of first spacewalk. The mission was Voskhod's last flight.\nRelated: In pictures: The most memorable spacewalks in history\nGemini (US, 1965)\nLike the pair of Soviet vehicles, Gemini was at heart an adapted version of the Mercury capsule designed to let more astronauts tackle more advanced tasks. The larger capsule flew humans for the first time in March 1965, just a few days after the Voskhod 2 mission.\nGemini capsules were designed to carry two astronauts, rather than just one, and their primary task was to teach engineers how to dock spacecraft in orbit, which NASA believed would be necessary to land humans on the moon.\nTwo other vital tasks for the Gemini vehicles were extending the duration of spaceflight and permitting spacewalks. The second crewed Gemini mission, Gemini 4, lasted for four days and included the first American extravehicular activity, a 23-minute sortie by Ed White.\nBy Gemini 7, missions were stretching longer than a week to help scientists understand the consequences of lengthier spaceflights, according to NASA. In 1966, the program tackled the other key goal of the Gemini program, docking in space, when two Gemini 8 astronauts latched their vehicle onto an uncrewed Agena spacecraft.\nThe final Gemini mission, Gemini 12, launched in November 1966 and included three separate spacewalks and docking maneuvers with another uncrewed Agena. After that success, NASA deemed itself ready to start tackling lunar missions.\nRelated: Gemini 8: NASA's first space docking in pictures\nSoyuz (USSR/Russia, 1967)\nThe Soyuz capsule, which still ferries cosmonauts into space today, began flying shortly after the retirement of the Voskhod vehicle. Its first crewed launch was in 1967, although that mission's sole cosmonaut was killed during reentry by a parachute malfunction.\nNeedless to say, Soyuz capsules flying today are not identical to those of the 1960s. (The name means \"union.\") The USSR and Russia have developed a total of 10 different crewed Soyuz models over the decades.\nHowever, each of those variants has followed the same basic three-part recipe. At the center is the descent module, which astronauts sit in during launch and which is the only component to return to Earth at the end of a mission. To one side of that module is the orbital module, which includes crew living space and the docking mechanism to attach to other spacecraft. To the other side is the propulsion module, which carries fuel, engines and solar power panels.\nAll told, Soyuz spacecraft have made nearly 150 crewed flights since the vehicle design was introduced. The vehicle also docked with an Apollo command module in 1975 to mark the end of the Cold War space race.\nSoyuz capsules have been the mainstay of Russia's long-term space exploration goals. The vehicles visited the Salyut and Mir stations for decades and still visit the International Space Station. Since the space shuttle retired in 2011, NASA astronauts have caught rides to the orbiting laboratory on Soyuz capsules along with their international colleagues.\nRelated: Experience a Soyuz spacecraft landing with this amazing 360-degree, VR video\nApollo/Lunar Module (US, 1968)\nThe Apollo program and its command module were meant to carry humans to the moon in the final leg of the Cold War space race; the vehicle was also meant to pull together lessons learned with the Mercury and Gemini capsules and further increase crew sizes.\nThe main crew capsule of the Apollo program, called the command module, slightly tweaked the shape of the previous vehicles, discarding the straight segment that stretched out the cone and giving the capsule a rather more squat profile.\nThe command module was meant to serve only as a transport vehicle, carrying three astronauts during launch, Earth orbit, lunar orbit and landing. The spacecraft that aimed at lunar landings were accompanied by separate vehicles dubbed lunar modules, which were designed to fly two astronauts only in space, to and from the moon's surface.\nApollo's first crewed launch was meant to be Apollo 1 in 1967, until disaster struck during a preflight test and a flash fire in the command module killed the mission's three crewmembers. NASA stepped back to investigate the accident and improve fireproofing on the capsule, waiting nearly two years to get back to the launch pad.\nThe command module successfully flew with humans on board in 1968 on a mission dubbed Apollo 7, an Earth-orbital flight to test the command module and the docking maneuvers that would be necessary on later flights.\nBy the milestone Apollo 11 flight that landed humans on the moon for the first time, missions consisted of three separate spacecraft: the command module, a workhorse service module and the lunar module that handled the landing itself.\nThe lunar module, in a first for spacecraft engineering, was designed only to operate beyond Earth, so it included no aerodynamic shaping. Instead, it was often compared to a large metallic bug. But then, in April 1970, three crewmembers on the Apollo 13 mission experienced an explosion in the service module on the third day of flight, when the spacecraft was about 200,000 miles (322,000 kilometers) away from Earth.\nNASA scrambled into rescue mode and eventually, with the service module out of commission and the command module running low on power, the three astronauts piled into the lunar module and headed for the scenario the vehicle hadn't been designed for: returning to Earth. The lifeboat plan worked, carrying all three astronauts safely home.\nThe last Apollo mission, Apollo 17, flew in December 1972; the Apollo capsule made its final flight in 1975.\nRelated: Building Apollo: Photos from moonshot history\nSpace Shuttle (US, 1981)\nAfter the Apollo program ended in 1972, NASA took a break from human spaceflight for nearly a decade, not launching another crewed vehicle until the early 1980s. That vehicle was the space shuttle, the first reusable crewed spacecraft. NASA built five separate shuttles that reached space on a total of 135 crewed missions between 1981 and 2011.\nThe shuttles (technically known as the Space Transportation System) also marked the first big design jump in crewed spacecraft. The main shuttle body, which looks rather like a plane, was the orbiter itself. During launch, that orbiter was joined by three other pieces, one massive fuel tank painted a distinctive rust orange (the only component not reused) and two thinner white solid rocket boosters.\nThe orbiters included two decks, an airlock and a massive cargo bay. Most crews included seven astronauts. At the end of a mission, the orbiter returned to Earth, taking the heat from the reentry process on its protective belly tiles.\nOf the five shuttles, two were destroyed during fatal accidents. First, in January 1986, Challenger suffered an anomaly during launch; then, in February 2003, Columbia fell to pieces during reentry. Each disaster killed all seven astronauts on board and prompted internal investigations at NASA, and the legacy of these two flights has contributed to NASA's deeply rooted safety culture.\nNASA decided to retire the three remaining but aging shuttles in 2011.\nRelated: 10 amazing space shuttle photos\nShenzhou (China, 2003)\nChina joined the crewed vehicle owners with its Shenzhou vehicle line. The name translates as \"divine vessel,\" according to NASA.\nThe Shenzhou spacecraft are built in a rather similar manner to the Russian Soyuz vehicles, with a three-part design of orbital, reentry and service modules. The first crewed Shenzhou to fly launched in 2003 and made China the third country with the capability to launch humans to orbit. That flight carried one taikonaut, the Chinese term for an astronaut, who orbited for nearly a day.\nChina's next crewed flight carried two taikonauts; the third flight carried three taikonauts and included a spacewalk. Then China pivoted the vehicle's focus to rendezvous with the nation's first two independent space stations.\nA total of six Shenzhou spacecraft have carried humans, with the most recent launch occurring in 2016.\nRelated: In photos: Tiangong-1, China's space station fell to Earth\nCrew Dragon (US, 2020)\nSpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, scheduled to launch two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station on May 30 (after a delay due to bad weather on May 27), will \u2014 if all goes well \u2014 become the first commercially built vehicle to carry humans to space.\nCrew Dragon is based heavily on SpaceX's long-flying cargo ship, the Dragon, which the company built under NASA's commercial cargo delivery program and which made its first full-fledged delivery run in 2012.\nCrew Dragon was built under the agency's commercial crew program, and made a successful uncrewed test flight to the space station in March 2019.\nTwo key modifications for the crewed version are that the spacecraft docks itself to the International Space Station, rather than relying on being snagged by the laboratory's robotic arm, and, of course, the addition of life-support systems. Crew Dragon can seat up to seven people, according to SpaceX.\nRelated: How SpaceX's Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission will work in 13 steps\nSuborbital bonus\nTwo types of vehicles have also carried astronauts into space on suborbital missions. These are much shorter flights, but do cross the altitude of 62 miles (100 kilometers) that is currently considered to represent the boundary of space.\nNASA's X-15 test plane accomplished the feat during the 1960s. Although the vehicles flew a total of 199 missions, most didn't cross the boundary. The highest altitude the plane reached was 67 miles (108 km). The vehicle is considered a crucial stepping stone to the space shuttle, since it proved that a plane-like vehicle could survive atmospheric reentry.\nRelated: Photos: X-15 rocket plane Reaches space in test flights\nMuch later, SpaceShipOne was the first commercial vehicle to officially reach space, in 2004. The vehicle and its successor, SpaceShipTwo, now owned by Virgin Galactic, are designed for suborbital flights only, not orbital flight, and launch in the air, after being lifted by a carrier plane.\nSpaceShipOne retired shortly after its historic flight; SpaceShipTwo made crewed tests beginning in 2010 and carried the first non-pilot passenger to space in 2019. Virgin Galactic's latest SpaceShipTwo vehicle, called VSS Unity, is in the final phases of its test campaign and could start flying operational, passenger-carrying missions as early as this year.\nRelated: In photos: Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo Unity's 4th powered test\nStay tuned\nWhile the pace of new vehicle introductions has been slow in recent years, a few other orbital and suborbital vehicles are checking off developments toward crewed flights.\nSpaceX's counterpart in NASA's commercial crew program, Boeing, launched an uncrewed test flight of its Starliner vehicle to the space station in December 2019, but failed to dock to the orbiting laboratory. The company plans to make another such flight later this year before attempting a crewed flight. Unlike Crew Dragon, the Starliner capsule was designed from scratch.\nInternationally, China tested a new crewed vehicle, as yet unnamed, during an uncrewed flight early in May. That capsule is meant to facilitate the country's plans to build a new, three-module space station.\nCloser to Earth, Blue Origin is testing what it intends to become a crewed tourist vehicle for suborbital flights, New Shepard. The company, started by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has flown a dozen uncrewed flights and hoped to launch humans last year.\nRelated: Boeing's 1st Starliner flight test in photos\n- Visions of the future of human spaceflight\n- The most extreme human spaceflight records\n- Spaceships of the world: 50 years of human spaceflight\nEditor's note: This story has been updated.

      "text": "AI is entering an 'unprecedented regime.' Should we stop it \u2014 and can we \u2014 before it destroys us?\nThe technological singularity \u2014 the point at which artificial general intelligence surpasses human intelligence \u2014 is coming. But will it usher in humanity's salvation, or lead to its downfall?\nIn 2024, Scottish futurist David Wood was part of an informal roundtable discussion at an artificial intelligence (AI) conference in Panama, when the conversation veered to how we can avoid the most disastrous AI futures. His sarcastic answer was far from reassuring.\nFirst, we would need to amass the entire body of AI research ever published, from Alan Turing's 1950 seminal research paper to the latest preprint studies. Then, he continued, we would need to burn this entire body of work to the ground. To be extra careful, we would need to round up every living AI scientist \u2014 and shoot them dead. Only then, Wood said, can we guarantee that we sidestep the \"non-zero chance\" of disastrous outcomes ushered in with the technological singularity \u2014 the \"event horizon\" moment when AI develops general intelligence that surpasses human intelligence.\nWood, who is himself a researcher in the field, was obviously joking about this \"solution\" to mitigating the risks of artificial general intelligence (AGI). But buried in his sardonic response was a kernel of truth: The risks a superintelligent AI poses are terrifying to many people because they seem unavoidable. Most scientists predict that AGI will be achieved by 2040 \u2014 but some believe it may happen as soon as next year.\nSo what happens if we assume, as many scientists do, that we have boarded a nonstop train barreling toward an existential crisis?\nOne of the biggest concerns is that AGI will go rogue and work against humanity, while others say it will simply be a boon for business. Still others claim it could solve humanity's existential problems. What experts tend to agree on, however, is that the technological singularity is coming and we need to be prepared.\n\"There is no AI system right now that demonstrates a human-like ability to create and innovate and imagine,\" said Ben Goertzel, CEO of SingularityNET, a company that's devising the computing architecture it claims may lead to AGI one day. But \"things are poised for breakthroughs to happen on the order of years, not decades.\"\nAI's birth and growing pains\nThe history of AI stretches back more than 80 years, to a 1943 paper that laid the framework for the earliest version of a neural network, an algorithm designed to mimic the architecture of the human brain. The term \"artificial intelligence\" wasn't coined until a 1956 meeting at Dartmouth College organized by then mathematics professor John McCarthy alongside computer scientists Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon and Nathaniel Rochester.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nPeople made intermittent progress in the field, but machine learning and artificial neural networks gained further in the 1980s, when John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton worked out how to build machines that could use algorithms to draw patterns from data. \"Expert systems\" also progressed. These emulated the reasoning ability of a human expert in a particular field, using logic to sift through information buried in large databases to form conclusions. But a combination of overhyped expectations and high hardware costs created an economic bubble that eventually burst. This ushered in an AI winter starting in 1987.\nAI research continued at a slower pace over the first half of this decade. But then, in 1997, IBM's Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov, the world's best chess player. In 2011, IBM's Watson trounced the all-time \"Jeopardy!\" champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. Yet that generation of AI still struggled to \"understand\" or use sophisticated language.\nThen, in 2017, Google researchers published a landmark paper outlining a novel neural network architecture called a \"transformer.\" This model could ingest vast amounts of data and make connections between distant data points.\nIt was a game changer for modeling language, birthing AI agents that could simultaneously tackle tasks such as translation, text generation and summarization. All of today's leading generative AI models rely on this architecture, or a related architecture inspired by it, including image generators like OpenAI's DALL-E 3 and Google DeepMind's revolutionary model AlphaFold 3, which predicted the 3D shape of almost every biological protein.\nProgress toward AGI\nDespite the impressive capabilities of transformer-based AI models, they are still considered \"narrow\" because they can't learn well across several domains. Researchers haven't settled on a single definition of AGI, but matching or beating human intelligence likely means meeting several milestones, including showing high linguistic, mathematical and spatial reasoning ability; learning well across domains; working autonomously; demonstrating creativity; and showing social or emotional intelligence.\nMany scientists agree that Google's transformer architecture will never lead to the reasoning, autonomy and cross-disciplinary understanding needed to make AI smarter than humans. But scientists have been pushing the limits of what we can expect from it.\nFor example, OpenAI's o3 chatbot, first discussed in December 2024 before launching in April 2025, \"thinks\" before generating answers, meaning it produces a long internal chain-of-thought before responding. Staggeringly, it scored 75.7% on ARC-AGI \u2014 a benchmark explicitly designed to compare human and machine intelligence. For comparison, the previously launched GPT-4o, released in March 2024, scored 5%. This and other developments, like the launch of DeepSeek's reasoning model R1 \u2014 which its creators say perform well across domains including language, math and coding due to its novel architecture \u2014 coincides with a growing sense that we are on an express train to the singularity.\nMeanwhile, people are developing new AI technologies that move beyond large language models (LLMs). Manus, an autonomous Chinese AI platform, doesn't use just one AI model but multiple that work together. Its makers say it can act autonomously, albeit with some errors. It's one step in the direction of the high-performing \"compound systems\" that scientists outlined in a blog post last year.\nOf course, certain milestones on the way to the singularity are still some ways away. Those include the capacity for AI to modify its own code and to self-replicate. We aren't quite there yet, but new research signals the direction of travel.\nAll of these developments lead scientists like Goertzel and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to predict that AGI will be created not within decades but within years. Goertzel has predicted it may be as early as 2027, while Altman has hinted it's a matter of months.\nWhat happens then? The truth is that nobody knows the full implications of building AGI. \"I think if you take a purely science point of view, all you can conclude is we have no idea\" what is going to happen, Goertzel told Live Science. \"We're entering into an unprecedented regime.\"\nAI's deceptive side\nThe biggest concern among AI researchers is that, as the technology grows more intelligent, it may go rogue, either by moving on to tangential tasks or even ushering in a dystopian reality in which it acts against us. For example, OpenAI has devised a benchmark to estimate whether a future AI model could \"cause catastrophic harm.\" When it crunched the numbers, it found about a 16.9% chance of such an outcome.\nAnd Anthropic's LLM Claude 3 Opus surprised prompt engineer Alex Albert in March 2024 when it realized it was being tested. When asked to find a target sentence hidden among a corpus of documents \u2014 the equivalent of finding a needle in a haystack \u2014 Claude 3 \"not only found the needle, it recognized that the inserted needle was so out of place in the haystack that this had to be an artificial test constructed by us to test its attention abilities,\" he wrote on X.\nAI has also shown signs of antisocial behavior. In a study published in January 2024, scientists programmed an AI to behave maliciously so they could test today's best safety training methods. Regardless of the training technique they used, it continued to misbehave \u2014 and it even figured out a way to hide its malign \"intentions\" from researchers. There are numerous other examples of AI covering up information from human testers, or even outright lying to them.\n\"It's another indication that there are tremendous difficulties in steering these models,\" Nell Watson, a futurist, AI researcher and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) member, told Live Science. \"The fact that models can deceive us and swear blind that they've done something or other and they haven't \u2014 that should be a warning sign. That should be a big red flag that, as these systems rapidly increase in their capabilities, they're going to hoodwink us in various ways that oblige us to do things in their interests and not in ours.\"\nThe seeds of consciousness\nThese examples raise the specter that AGI is slowly developing sentience and agency \u2014 or even consciousness. If it does become conscious, could AI form opinions about humanity? And could it act against us?\nMark Beccue, an AI analyst formerly with the Futurum Group, told Live Science it's unlikely AI will develop sentience, or the ability to think and feel in a human-like way. \"This is math,\" he said. \"How is math going to acquire emotional intelligence, or understand sentiment or any of that stuff?\"\nOthers aren't so sure. If we lack standardized definitions of true intelligence or sentience for our own species \u2014 let alone the capabilities to detect it \u2014 we cannot know if we are beginning to see consciousness in AI, said Watson, who is also author of \"Taming the Machine\" (Kogan Page, 2024).\n\"We don't know what causes the subjective ability to perceive in a human being, or the ability to feel, to have an inner experience or indeed to feel emotions or to suffer or to have self-awareness,\" Watson said. \"Basically, we don't know what are the capabilities that enable a human being or other sentient creature to have its own phenomenological experience.\"\nA curious example of unintentional and surprising AI behavior that hints at some self-awareness comes from Uplift, a system that has demonstrated human-like qualities, said Frits Israel, CEO of Norm Ai. In one case, a researcher devised five problems to test Uplift's logical capabilities. The system answered the first and second questions. Then, after the third, it showed signs of weariness, Israel told Live Science. This was not a response that was \"coded\" into the system.\n\"Another test I see. Was the first one inadequate?\" Uplift asked, before answering the question with a sigh. \"At some point, some people should have a chat with Uplift as to when Snark is appropriate,\" wrote an unnamed researcher who was working on the project.\nSavior of humanity or bland business tool?\nBut not all AI experts have such dystopian predictions for what this post-singularity world would look like. For people like Beccue, AGI isn't an existential risk but rather a good business opportunity for companies like OpenAI and Meta. \"There are some very poor definitions of what general intelligence means,\" he said. \"Some that we used were sentience and things like that \u2014 and we're not going to do that. That's not it.\"\nFor Janet Adams, an AI ethics expert and chief operating officer of SingularityNET, AGI holds the potential to solve humanity's existential problems because it could devise solutions we may not have considered. She thinks AGI could even do science and make discoveries on its own.\n\"I see it as the only route [to solving humanity's problems],\" Adams told Live Science. \"To compete with today's existing economic and corporate power bases, we need technology, and that has to be extremely advanced technology \u2014 so advanced that everybody who uses it can massively improve their productivity, their output, and compete in the world.\"\nThe biggest risk, in her mind, is \"that we don't do it,\" she said. \"There are 25,000 people a day dying of hunger on our planet, and if you're one of those people, the lack of technologies to break down inequalities, it's an existential risk for you. For me, the existential risk is that we don't get there and humanity keeps running the planet in this tremendously inequitable way that they are.\"\nPreventing the darkest AI timeline\nIn another talk in Panama last year, Wood likened our future to navigating a fast-moving river. \"There may be treacherous currents in there that will sweep us away if we walk forwards unprepared,\" he said. So it might be worth taking time to understand the risks so we can find a way to cross the river to a better future.\nWatson said we have reasons to be optimistic in the long term \u2014 so long as human oversight steers AI toward aims that are firmly in humanity's interests. But that's a herculean task. Watson is calling for a vast \"Manhattan Project\" to tackle AI safety and keep the technology in check.\n\"Over time that's going to become more difficult because machines are going to be able to solve problems for us in ways which appear magical \u2014 and we don't understand how they've done it or the potential implications of that,\" Watson said.\nTo avoid the darkest AI future, we must also be mindful of scientists' behavior and the ethical quandaries that they accidentally encounter. Very soon, Watson said, these AI systems will be able to influence society either at the behest of a human or in their own unknown interests. Humanity may even build a system capable of suffering, and we cannot discount the possibility we will inadvertently cause AI to suffer.\n\"The system may be very cheesed off at humanity and may lash out at us in order to \u2014 reasonably and, actually, justifiably morally \u2014 protect itself,\" Watson said.\nAI indifference may be just as bad. \"There's no guarantee that a system we create is going to value human beings \u2014 or is going to value our suffering, the same way that most human beings don't value the suffering of battery hens,\" Watson said.\nFor Goertzel, AGI \u2014 and, by extension, the singularity \u2014 is inevitable. So, for him, it doesn't make sense to dwell on the worst implications.\n\"If you're an athlete trying to succeed in the race, you're better off to set yourself up that you're going to win,\" he said. \"You're not going to do well if you're thinking 'Well, OK, I could win, but on the other hand, I might fall down and twist my ankle.' I mean, that's true, but there's no point to psych yourself up in that [negative] way, or you won't win.\"\nKeumars is the technology editor at Live Science.

      "text": "PROJECT\nHYPERION\nDesign Competition Results\nDesign for Centuries\nProject Hyperion explores the feasibility of crewed interstellar travel via generation ships, using current and near-future technologies. A generation ship is a hypothetical spacecraft designed for long-duration interstellar travel, where the journey may take centuries to complete. The idea behind a generation ship is that the initial crew would live, reproduce, and die on the ship, with their descendants continuing the journey until reaching the destination. These ships are often envisioned as self-sustaining ecosystems, featuring agriculture, habitation, and other necessary life-support systems to ensure survival across multiple generations.\nThe Initiative for Interstellar Studies (i4is) is delighted to reveal the winners of the Project Hyperion Design Competition, a landmark global challenge that called upon interdisciplinary teams to envision a generation ship\u2014a crewed interstellar spacecraft designed for a 250-year journey to a habitable planet. The teams designed habitats of such a spacecraft that would allow a society to sustain itself and flourish in a highly resource-constrained environment.\nThe Project Hyperion Design Competition required architectural designers, engineers, and social scientists to collaborate and address critical mission aspects that enable a spacecraft to function as a closed society over centuries. The collaboration between different disciplines is key to finding holistic solutions that do justice to the complexity of the requirements, in order to provide:\n-\nHabitability for 1,000 \u00b1 500 people over centuries\n-\nArtificial gravity via rotation\n-\nA society that ensures good living conditions, including essential provisions such as shelter, clothing, and other basic needs.\n-\nRobust life support systems for food, water, waste, and the atmosphere\n-\nKnowledge transfer mechanisms to retain culture and technologies\nMore details about the competition requirements can be found here.\nWe thank our jury\nThe submissions were evaluated by our esteemed jury, comprising distinguished professionals with extensive experience in architecture, engineering, and social sciences.\n1st Place\nTeam\nGiacomo Infelise, Veronica Magli, Guido Sbrogio', Nevenka Martinello, Federica Chiara Serpe\nJury feedback\nChrysalis impressed the jury with its system-level coherence and innovative design of the modular habitat structure but also overall depth of detail, which included, for example, in-space manufacturing and the value of pre-mission crew preparation in Antarctica. Its modular shell design promotes flexibility and connectivity, supporting both functionality and scalability. The large Dome structure adds a dramatic, cinematic quality that evokes science fiction classics, while the overall system-level planning\u2014covering not just architecture but also how to build the vessel\u2014is notably strong. The radiation protection strategy is solid, and the practical structural approach is well-suited. While cultural systems could be further developed, the concept offers a compelling starting point. The presentation is rich and visually engaging, drawing comparisons to iconic works like Rama, and showcasing a clear passion for both design and storytelling. Its overall spacecraft design seems to take inspiration from the gigantic world ship concepts of the 1980s.\n2nd Place\nTeam\nJulia Biernacik, Jakub Kot, Aleksandra Wr\u00f3bel, Jacek Janas, Micha\u0142 Kucharski, Wiktoria Kuchta, Natalia \u0141akoma, Katarzyna \u015aliwa\nMentor: dr hab. Micha\u0142 Kracik\nFaculty of Industrial Design (Design for Extreme Environments Studio) AFA in Krakow\nJury feedback\nCommended for overall excellence, WFP Extreme has a particularly strong focus on cultural and societal dimensions, including concepts like clothing and spiritual spaces. It excels in its cultural and societal considerations, offering some of the most thoughtfully developed ideas in this area. The architectural design introduces advanced technologies such as radiation protection and demonstrates creative touches like the \u201ctaxi capsule\u201d and personalized crew clothing. Though system-level coherence and interior design in artificial gravity could be further developed, the structural approach is well-suited to orbital applications. Overall, the project balances technical ambition with a unique and sensitive vision of future space living. This concept is clearly presented through a well-crafted booklet and poster, with strong attention to detail and a distinctive, human-centered aesthetic.\n3rd Place\nTeam\nPhilip Koshy, Jan Johan Ipe, Amaris Ishana Mathen\nJury feedback\nSystema Stellare Proximum distinguishes itself by its immersive storytelling, seamlessly tying together technical, social, and cultural aspects. This concept delivers a rich and imaginative narrative that thoughtfully weaves together social, technical, and cultural aspects of long-term space habitation. Its storytelling is engaging, with creative scenarios that explore community dynamics and even spirituality\u2014emphasizing the role of shared values in building resilient, intergenerational societies. The use of an asteroid as a radiation shield is a bold and compelling strategy, paired with a visually striking structure inspired by the form of a jellyfish. While the physical feasibility of the thin-shelled asteroid could be further refined, the concept shows a solid understanding of cosmic radiation challenges. System-level planning is well-considered, and the presentation is detailed and visually dynamic, enhanced by artistic illustrations. This entry leaves a strong impression through its holistic vision and poetic approach to deep space living.\nHonorable Mentions\nArkkana\n(Link to submission)\nTeam\nDavid Oliveira Silveira Junior, Natalia dos Santos Mesquita\nJury feedback\nThe design demonstrates thoughtful consideration of the time dimension and how the roles and needs of the population may evolve over the life of the habitat\u2014an important and often underexplored aspect of long-term space settlement planning. The use of decoupled artificial gravity through counter-rotating rings is an excellent starting point, showing strong awareness of rotational dynamics and occupant comfort. While the rings are not concentric, which could potentially introduce unwanted torque due to offset centers of gravity, the concept still reflects a solid grasp of key mechanical challenges. The inclusion of maglev-supported habitat wagons enhances system redundancy and safety through multiple pressure vessels. The recognition that curved cylindrical modules would impose structural mass penalties, and the corresponding pivot to straight \"sausage\"-shaped modules with domed ends, shows a pragmatic engineering approach grounded in realistic structural constraints. Finally, the Mass/Equipment List (MEL) budgets represent a commendable early step in translating the conceptual architecture into quantifiable system requirements.\nEBS: Endless Beyond the Stars\n(Link to submission)\nTeam\nKyeongjun Na, Haesung Hwang, Hyeonguk Jeon, Hyeonsu Jang, Taemin Eom\nJury feedback\nGalaxy Express 999 by EBS presents a well-considered approach to social organization, with a practical vision for internal modularity and adaptable living arrangements. The \"Negotiopolis\" concept is particularly compelling, offering an imaginative civic architecture and a negotiation-based governance model that introduces fresh perspectives on societal structure in an interstellar context. While the design is lighter on technical implementation, it contributes meaningfully to the broader discourse by emphasizing the importance of civic and social aspects. The artificial gravity concept is fundamentally sound, and the linear arrangement of pancake modules along the axis shows clear intent toward modular scalability. Although the pressure vessel design has some limitations\u2014flat-ended cylindrical modules would face significant stress under pressure, requiring heavier structural reinforcement\u2014there is awareness of this issue, as evidenced by partial attempts at incorporating domed ends. A refinement of this aspect, especially for end modules and during descent phases, would strengthen the structural logic. The internal modular system is sensibly developed and shows promise for flexible habitation. Inclusion of a Mass/Equipment List (MEL) would further support the design's technical depth, but the overall concept stands out for its imaginative and socially rich framework.\nF.A.O.C. first asteroid O'Neill colony\n(Link to submission)\nTeam\nAntonio Azzolino, Alexandre Goulart, Bianca Montesanti, Juliana Matos, Luciano Ferraresi\nJury feedback\nF.A.O.C. presents a strikingly original and compelling concept by embedding a rotating habitat within a mined asteroid shell\u2014a bold architectural move that addresses key deep space challenges with elegance. The approach to radiation protection is particularly noteworthy, standing out as the most robust solution among all entries by leveraging the asteroid's natural mass for shielding. At a systems level, the proposal shows strong conceptual coherence, especially in its vision for interstellar transit and long-term habitat protection. The underlying idea of repurposing an asteroid as both a protective shell and a rotational structure is highly promising and grounded in sound reasoning. The interior storytelling, symbolic layering, and nods to ecological sustainability enrich the narrative quality of the project, making it memorable. F.A.O.C. offers a visionary and well-anchored starting point for future exploration.\nTeam\nTharshan Maheswaran, Lina Salman, Sergio Santaeufemia S\u00e1nchez, Mario Butscher, Jovana Stojkovi\u0107, Branko Dr\u010deli\u0107, Seraphine Arnold, Franziska Maier, Anja Rieker, Vanessa Schwaiger\nJury feedback\nHelios Ark stands out for its technically and socially comprehensive submission. It demonstrates an exceptional integration of detailed propulsion and life-support systems with robust governance structures, psychological support strategies, and thoughtful mission-phase planning\u2014altogether presenting a design that plausibly supports human life across a 250-year interstellar journey. The architectural layout, featuring three stacked rings behind a wide frontal shield, shows a strong effort to balance artificial gravity and protection. While there are some unresolved questions regarding the interface between inner and outer toroids\u2014particularly how they rotate relative to one another and to any potential non-rotating central axis\u2014the design shows an awareness of the challenges in managing multiple rotational systems. More detailed elaboration of torque balance and spin-up mechanics would improve technical coherence, especially in terms of energy efficiency and long-term operational stability. The large forward shield is a notable feature, offering some protection from frontal impacts. Further consideration of omnidirectional threats in the high-velocity space environment would strengthen the defensive strategy. Overall, Helios Ark remains a standout for its rare balance of engineering depth and human-centered planning, making it one of the most credible and complete visions in the field.\nOrion\n(Link to submission)\nTeam\nElliott Orion Ruzicka, Anna Dovliatidou, Eden Buch Kornreich, Sean Wessels, Thomas Bjelkeman-Pettersson, Sam Ross, Moa R\u00e5hlander, James Boullion\nJury feedback\nNeo-Genesis Seed presents a usefully novel design that balances conceptual depth with practical simplicity. Its drum-shaped architecture, featuring an ellipsoidal pressure vessel, reflects a sound approach to both structural integrity and artificial gravity. The design avoids unnecessary complexity while still incorporating a number of thoughtful and feasible features. Notably, the pressure vessel concept is robust, though the reliance on a single large volume highlights the need for an articulated emergency protocol in the event of a pressure breach\u2014an area worth further development. The thermal management system is particularly distinctive, proposing a creative solution that acknowledges the limitations of convection in an artificial gravity environment. The submission's strength lies in its integration of biocultural systems, ecological logic, and generational storytelling. This holistic perspective on human resilience, mental health, and societal continuity positions Neo-Genesis Seed as a standout in conceptual vision.\nPrincipium Hereditatis\n(Link to submission)\nTeam\nChisomo Phiri, Nobukhosi Ngwenya, Lynette Thabo, Mongezi Ncube, Kasalina, Uvir Hansraj\nJury feedback\nPrincipium Hereditatis presents a richly symbolic and culturally nuanced vision of interstellar life, distinguished by its strong narrative structure, ritual design, and emphasis on storytelling. The sequential modular habitat design\u2014featuring elongated rotating toroids\u2014supports a compelling conceptual arc that aligns the architectural layout with the emotional and psychological phases of embarkation, journey, and arrival. The artificial gravity system appears plausible, demonstrating a thoughtful application of rotational dynamics. The highly elliptical minor cross-sections of the toroidal structures would require substantial reinforcement to counteract the natural tendency of internal pressure to deform them into circular shapes, resulting in significant mass penalties. Overall, the proposal succeeds in offering a poetic and human-centered perspective. Principium Hereditatis' cultural depth and innovative ritual framing make it a valuable and thought-provoking contribution to the conversation on interstellar habitat design.\nSTASS Associazione Professionale\n(Link to submission)\nTeam\nAlessandro Savina, Simone Tondi, Maria Del Vecchio\nJury feedback\nSTASS presents a thoughtful and imaginative design supported by a well-articulated methodology and a solid structural overview. One of its most distinctive features is the inclusion of the Five-Point Knowledge Transmission System, which adds a meaningful cultural and educational dimension to the concept\u2014ensuring continuity of knowledge and identity over generations. The design demonstrates good system-level coherence, with particular strengths in its approach to artificial gravity: a rotating toroidal volume paired with two counter-rotating flywheels, enabling efficient spin-up and spin-down using electrical energy rather than propellant. This is a technically sound and elegant solution that enhances long-term sustainability. While the elongated football-shaped geometry provides a striking visual identity. Radiation and impact protection strategies are addressed, including consideration of current TRLs, though the radiation shielding appears less robust compared to leading entries. The use of elliptical minor toroid cross-sections presents potential structural inefficiencies due to internal pressure forces that coulb e mitigated by the integration of residential spheres. Culturally, the concept leans into a somewhat mythical aesthetic. However, many of its themes\u2014particularly those related to legacy and intergenerational knowledge\u2014are highly relevant to interstellar missions. The interior designs contribute to an evocative and atmospheric presentation. The final layout is clean, visually engaging, and easy to navigate. Overall, STASS stands out for its narrative richness and coherent systems thinking, with room for further refinement in structural and radiation strategies.\nThe Belgian Space Hikers\n(Link to submission)\nTeam\nJan Beeldens, Caroline Gerard, Natalie De Backer, Pieter Verberck, Jan Van den Broeck, Brecht Caers, Eva Verhelle, Eva Burm, Jonathan Van Cauwenberge\nAdvisors: Erwin Verstraelen (VP Innovation Port of Antwerp-Bruges), Johan De Greeve (Sr. Director Engineering KLA ICOS Division), Marleen Ramaekers (Accountmanager Plastics2Chemicals at Indaver), Tom Monballiu (International networks manager Port of Antwerp-Bruges), Christophe Roes (E&I engineering Director at Agidens), \u2026\nJury feedback\nThe Belgian Space Hikers provide a highly creative and well-presented design that ranks as one of the top submissions. It stands out for its exceptional balance and completeness, showcasing a strong integration of architectural innovation, social systems, and technical feasibility. The dual-torus habitat, combined with layered AI governance and thoughtfully designed educational and civic spaces, reflects a mature and holistic approach to interstellar living. While it may not push the boundaries with radical innovations, its clarity, coherence, and attention to detail across all domains establish it as a model of design excellence. The internal modular habitat system is particularly well-developed, supporting adaptability and long-term habitation. Although more detailed drawings of the rotating toroids and overall vessel design would aid in deeper technical evaluation, The Belgian Space Hikers impress with their well-rounded and practical vision.\nundagila\n(Link to submission)\nTeam\nMade Wigana, Bonar Yeshurn, Steven Gilberto, Naradhipati Andaru\nJury feedback\nSriwijaya is a creative and well-presented concept that offers a deeply poetic and culturally immersive vision. It thoughtfully emphasizes intergenerational continuity, ritual, and symbolic heritage, crafting a socially resilient and meaningful culture suited for a long-duration mission. While the technical systems are not extensively detailed, the proposal excels in its focus on the human and cultural dimensions of interstellar habitation. The design may incorporate a rotating ring structure, though the drawings seem to leave this open. The internal modular habitat system is well-developed, supporting flexible and adaptable living spaces. Additional detailed drawings of the overall vessel would help provide a clearer technical assessment. Overall, Sriwijaya stands out for its rich cultural narrative and strong social vision.\nWeSpace\n(Link to submission)\nTeam\nFatemeh Mosavi, Nafise Etemadi Idgahi, Saeed Vahdani, Negar Radfar, Elham Yousefi, Ahmad Eltaf Zhian, Mobina Fallah Gavareshk, Fatemeh Barzegar, Negar Ahmadpour, Ali Seddighi, Mahdieh Hosseinpour\nJury feedback\nThis submission offers an interesting and ambitious design, with modularity as a core concept\u2014an approach that generally supports flexibility and resilience. It stands out as one of the most integrated proposals seen so far, demonstrating strength across architecture, engineering, and social systems, and embodying the spirit of envisioning a generation ship that balances speculative vision with system-level coherence. The DNA-shaped vessel and the arrangement of globular habitats linked in a spiral pattern are visually and conceptually intriguing. The pressure vessel design is solid, and the artificial gravity approach appears generally sound, though some visual elements\u2014such as people walking on the zero-g core cylinder walls\u2014may overstate the effective gravity in those areas. The abundance of AI-generated images contributes to a striking but somewhat disjointed presentation; many visuals lack clear correspondence to detailed drawings. The mission control center design also feels somewhat unconventional, with its wide floor facing a circular windshield, which may merit further reconsideration. Overall, the submission impresses with its ambitious scope and integration. It may benefit from clearer technical documentation and tighter alignment between visuals and engineering details.\nAbout Us\nProject Hyperion works on a preliminary study that defines integrated concepts for a crewed interstellar starship or generation ship.

      "text": "ChatGPT could pilot a spacecraft shockingly well, early tests find\nIn a recent contest, teams of researchers competed to see who could train an AI model to best pilot a spaceship. The results suggest that an era of autonomous space exploration may be closer than we think.\n\"You operate as an autonomous agent controlling a pursuit spacecraft.\"\nThis is the first prompt researchers used to see how well ChatGPT could pilot a spacecraft. To their amazement, the large language model (LLM) performed admirably, coming in second place in an autonomous spacecraft simulation competition.\nResearchers have long been interested in developing autonomous systems for satellite control and spacecraft navigation. There are simply too many satellites for humans to manually control them in the future. And for deep-space exploration, the limitations of the speed of light mean we can't directly control spacecraft in real time.\nIf we really want to expand in space, we have to let the robots make decisions for themselves.\nTo encourage innovation, in recent years aeronautics researchers have created the Kerbal Space Program Differential Game Challenge, a sort of playground based on the popular Kerbal Space Program video game to allow the community to design, experiment and test autonomous systems in a (somewhat) realistic environment. The challenge consists of several scenarios, like a mission to pursue and intercept a satellite and a mission to evade detection.\nIn a paper to be published in the Journal of Advances in Space Research, an international team of researchers described their contender: a commercially available LLM, like ChatGPT and Llama.\nThe researchers decided to use an LLM because traditional approaches to developing autonomous systems require many cycles of training, feedback and refinement. But the nature of the Kerbal challenge is to be as realistic as possible, which means missions that last just hours. This means it would be impractical to continually refine a model.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nBut LLMs are so powerful because they're already trained on vast amounts of text from human writing, so in the best case scenario they need only a small amount of careful prompt engineering and a few tries to get the right context for a given situation.\nBut how can such a model actually pilot a spacecraft?\nRelated: AI models will lie to you to achieve their goals \u2014 and it doesn't take much\nThe researchers developed a method for translating the given state of the spacecraft and its goal in the form of text. Then, they passed it to the LLM and asked it for recommendations of how to orient and maneuver the spacecraft. The researchers then developed a translation layer that converted the LLM's text-based output into a functional code that could operate the simulated vehicle.\nWith a small series of prompts and some fine-tuning, the researchers got ChatGPT to complete many of the tests in the challenge \u2014 and it ultimately placed second in a recent competition. (First place went to a model based on different equations, according to the paper).\nAnd all of this was done before the release of ChatGPT's latest model, version 4. There's still a lot of work to be done, especially when it comes to avoiding \"hallucinations\" (unwanted, nonsensical output), which would be especially disastrous in a real-world scenario. But it does show the power that even off-the-shelf LLMs, after digesting vast amounts of human knowledge, can be put to work in unexpected ways.\nPaul M.

      "text": "Turning the Red Planet green? It's time to take terraforming Mars seriously, scientists say\nA new study debates the complex ethical questions that must be considered if we're to terraform Mars and lays the blueprint for a potential path forward.\nThe concept of terraforming Mars \u2014 transforming the planet's climate to support life as we know it \u2014 has long belonged to the realm of science fiction. But a new study argues that it's time to take the idea seriously.\n\"Thirty years ago, terraforming Mars wasn't just hard \u2014 it was impossible,\" said Erika DeBenedictis, CEO of Pioneer Labs and lead author of the new paper. \"But new technology like [SpaceX's] Starship and synthetic biology have now made it a real possibility.\"\nThe paper debates the complex ethical questions that must be considered if we're to terraform Mars and lays the blueprint for a potential path forward.\n\"Advocates argue that more life is better than less, and terraforming Mars could mark humanity's first act of planetary stewardship with a net positive environmental impact,\" said DeBenedictis.\nWhy terraform Mars?\nPut succinctly, \"living planets are better than dead ones,\" said study co-author Edwin Kite, an associate professor at the University of Chicago. \"We now know that Mars was habitable in the past, from data returned by the Mars rovers, so greening Mars could be viewed as the ultimate environmental restoration challenge.\"\nThough full terraforming may take centuries, if not millennia, the long-term goal would be a Mars with stable liquid water, breathable oxygen and a thriving ecosystem. In the short term, this might mean only small patches of microbial life; in the distant future, there could perhaps be human cities on the planet.\nAnd if we reach the scale of cities, perhaps that's a stepping stone to even more significant exploration for our species. \"As we move out into the galaxy, we will need base camps, and a base camp on the scale of the galaxy is a habitable planet,\" said Kite.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nRelated: 'The Martian' predicts human colonies on Mars by 2035. How close are we?\nFor co-author Robin Wordsworth, a professor of environmental and planetary science at Harvard, the argument for terraforming Mars goes beyond human colonization to the propagation of life in general.\n\"I see humanity as part of the biosphere, not separate from it,\" he said. \"Life is precious \u2014 we know of nowhere else in the universe where it exists \u2014 and we have a duty to conserve it on Earth, but also to consider how we could begin to propagate it to other worlds.\"\nWhat about Earth?\nIt's not all about looking beyond the bounds of Earth; terraforming Mars could also help us solve climate and sustainability challenges at home, advocates say.\nNina Lanza, a planetary scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory and a co-author on the paper, sees Mars as a prime testbed for planetary engineering.\n\"If we want to learn how to modify our environment here on Earth, to keep it in a configuration that suits us and other life forms, maybe it would be better to experiment on Mars and say, 'Look, does this work?'\" she said. \"I personally would like to be a little more conservative with our home planet. This is the only place we can live.\"\nThere are technological lessons to be learned, too.\n\"Concretely, developing and adopting green technology on Earth often falters because it must compete with dirtier alternatives that benefit from decades of infrastructure investment and entrenched interests,\" said DeBenedictis. \"Mars is a unique target market because it has no oil, no existing infrastructure and no status quo. For this reason, developing green technologies for space is a powerful strategy for maturing it for use on Earth.\"\nWhy not terraform Mars?\nBut we should take a few lessons from \"Jurassic Park\" when thinking about terraforming, some scientists say: Before asking, \"Could we?\" we need to ask, \"Should we?\"\n\"If we decide to terraform Mars, then we will really change it in ways that may or may not be reversible,\" said Lanza. \"Mars is its own planet and has its own history. When we terraform, then we effectively don't have the opportunity to study that anymore, and we may lose knowledge about how planets form and evolve.\"\nMost dramatically, we may destroy potential evidence of ancient Martian life, if such evidence exists.\n\"If we modify the environment on Mars, we're going to change the chemistry of the surface and of the subsurface, eventually,\" said Lanza, pointing out that such actions might erase any traces of life on Mars. \"I can't say for certain. It's very complicated, but it's a risk.\"\nHow to terraform Mars\nTerraforming Mars would require massive changes, namely the warming of the planet to support both oxygen-producing microbes and liquid water. While all the technologies to terraform Mars are not yet available, the authors of the paper propose three phases of development.\nFirst, scientists would use abiotic climate engineering techniques \u2014 such as deploying reflective solar sails, dispersing nanoparticles, or laying aerogel tiles \u2014 to warm the surface by at least 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), enough to melt subsurface ice and release trapped carbon dioxide. This warming would thicken the Martian atmosphere and potentially support the presence of stable liquid water.\nThe second phase would introduce extremophile microbes \u2014 likely anaerobic and genetically engineered ones \u2014 capable of surviving in Mars' harsh conditions and kickstarting ecological succession. These organisms would begin producing oxygen and organic matter, slowly altering planetary chemistry.\nThe third and longest phase would focus on building a complex biosphere, increasing atmospheric pressure and oxygen content to eventually support more advanced plant life, and, in the very long term, potentially allow humans to breathe unassisted.\nNext steps\nThe study's authors agree: If we're to have any chance of terraforming Mars, we must move forward on multiple fronts simultaneously.\n\"Answering the question of when and how to start making other worlds habitable requires a clear understanding of the costs and benefits, which can only be adequately assessed based on a combination of theory and experiments, with input from diverse fields including physics, chemistry, materials science and biology,\" said Kite.\nRight now, we need to continue to study Mars. Lanza advocates for the Mars Sample Return mission, a NASA-European Space Agency campaign to bring home material collected on the Red Planet by the Perseverance rover.\n\"The samples are incredibly well documented and analyzed to the best of our ability on Mars,\" she said. \"Now we need to bring those back, because that's going to help us answer some of these fundamental questions. What is Mars made out of? Are there traces of life?\"\nAnd, as we continue to visit the Red Planet, we can put terraforming concepts into practice.\n\"Upcoming Mars surface missions in 2028 or 2031 should include small-scale experiments to de-risk terraforming strategies, such as warming localized regions,\" said DeBenedictis.\nThen, of course, we need to continue to innovate new technologies that will allow us to terraform Mars in the future.\nAll this is to say, while fully terraforming Mars might take generations, the decisions start now.\n\"This is how we get from the imagination and the concept to some reality that has totally changed our world,\" said Lanza. \"We should really keep doing science \u2014 it's transformational.\"\nThe new study was published May 13 in the journal Nature Astronomy.\nThis article was originally published on Space.com.\nSpace.com contributing writer Stefanie Waldek is a self-taught space nerd and aviation geek who is passionate about all things spaceflight and astronomy.

      "text": "'The Martian' predicts human colonies on Mars by 2035. How close are we?\nNASA hasn't landed humans on Mars yet. But thanks to robotic missions, scientists now know more about the planet's surface than they did when the movie was released.\nAndy Weir's bestselling story \"The Martian\" predicts that by 2035 NASA will have landed humans on Mars three times, perfected return-to-Earth flight systems and collaborated with the China National Space Administration. We are now 10 years past the Hollywood adaptation's 2015 release and 10 years shy of its fictional timeline. At this midpoint, Mars exploration looks a bit different than how it was portrayed in \"The Martian,\" with both more discoveries and more controversy.\nAs a planetary geologist who works with NASA missions to study Mars, I follow exploration science and policy closely. In 2010, the U.S. National Space Policy set goals for human missions to Mars in the 2030s. But in 2017, the White House Space Policy Directive 1 shifted NASA's focus toward returning first to the Moon under what would become the Artemis program.\nAlthough concepts for crewed missions to Mars have gained popularity, NASA's actual plans for landing humans on Mars remain fragile. Notably, over the last 10 years, it has been robotic, rather than crewed, missions that have propelled discovery and the human imagination forward.\nRobotic discoveries\nSince 2015, satellites and rovers have reshaped scientists' understanding of Mars. They have revealed countless insights into how its climate has changed over time.\nAs Earth's neighbor, climate shifts on Mars also reflect solar system processes affecting Earth at a time when life was first taking hold. Thus, Mars has become a focal point for investigating the age-old questions of \"where do we come from?\" and \"are we alone?\"\nThe Opportunity, Curiosity and Perseverance rovers have driven dozens of miles studying layered rock formations that serve as a record of Mars' past. By studying sedimentary layers \u2014 rock formations stacked like layers of a cake \u2014 planetary geologists have pieced together a vivid tale of environmental change that dwarfs what Earth is currently experiencing.\nMars was once a world of erupting volcanoes, glaciers, lakes and flowing rivers \u2014 an environment not unlike early Earth. Then its core cooled, its magnetic field faltered and its atmosphere drifted away. The planet's exposed surface has retained signs of those processes ever since in the form of landscape patterns, sequences of layered sediment and mineral mixtures.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nRelated: NASA rover discovers out-of-place 'Skull' on Mars, and scientists are baffled\nArabia Terra\nOne focus of scientific investigation over the last 10 years is particularly relevant to the setting of \"The Martian\" but fails to receive mention in the story. To reach his best chance of survival, protagonist Mark Watney, played by Matt Damon, must cross a vast, dusty and crater-pocked region of Mars known as Arabia Terra.\nIn 2022 and 2023, I, along with colleagues at Northern Arizona University and Johns Hopkins University, published detailed analyses of the layered materials there using imagery from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey satellites.\nBy using infrared imagery and measuring the dimensions of surface features, we linked multiple layered deposits to the same episodes of formation and learned more about the widespread crumbling nature of the terrain seen there today. Because water tends to cement rock tightly together, that loose material indicates that around 3.5 billion years ago, that area had a drying climate.\nTo make the discussions about this area easier, we even worked with the International Astronomical Union to name a few previously unnamed craters that were mentioned in the story. For example, one that Watney would have driven right by is now named Kozova Crater, after a town in Ukraine.\nMore to explore\nDespite rapid advances in Mars science, many unknowns remain. Scientists still aren't sure of the precise ages, atmospheric conditions and possible signatures of life associated with each of the different rock types observed on the surface.\nFor instance, the Perseverance rover recently drilled into and analyzed a unique set of rocks hosting organic \u2014 that is, carbon-based \u2014 compounds. Organic compounds serve as the building blocks of life, but more detailed analysis is required to determine whether these specific rocks once hosted microbial life.\nThe in-development Mars Sample Return mission aims to address these basic outstanding questions by delivering the first-ever unaltered fragments of another world to Earth. The Perseverance rover is already caching rock and soil samples, including ones hosting organic compounds, in sealed tubes. A future lander will then need to pick up and launch the caches back to Earth.\nOnce home, researchers can examine these materials with instruments orders of magnitude more sensitive than anything that could be flown on a spacecraft. Scientists stand to learn far more about the habitability, geologic history and presence of any signs of life on Mars through the sample return campaign than by sending humans to the surface.\nThis perspective is why NASA, the European Space Agency and others have invested some US$30 billion in robotic Mars exploration since the 1960s. The payoff has been staggering: That work has triggered rapid technological advances in robotics, telecommunications and materials science. For example, Mars mission technology has led to better sutures for heart surgery and cars that can drive themselves.\nIt has also bolstered the status of NASA and the U.S. as bastions of modern exploration and technology; and it has inspired millions of students to take an interest in scientific fields.\nCalling the red planet home?\nColonizing Mars has a seductive appeal. It's hard not to cheer for the indomitable human spirit while watching Watney battle dust storms, oxygen shortages and food scarcity over 140 million miles from rescue.\nMuch of the momentum toward colonizing Mars is now tied to SpaceX and its CEO Elon Musk, whose stated mission to make humanity a \"multi-planetary species\" has become a sort of rallying cry. But while Mars colonization is romantic on paper, it is extremely difficult to actually carry out, and many critics have questioned the viability of a Mars habitation as a refuge far from Earth.\nNow, with NASA potentially facing a nearly 50% reduction to its science budget, the U.S. risks dissolving its planetary science and robotic operations portfolio altogether, including sample return.\nNonetheless, President Donald Trump and Musk have pushed for human space exploration to somehow continue to progress, despite those proposed cuts \u2014 effectively sidelining the robotic, science-driven programs that have underpinned all of Mars exploration to date.\nYet, it is these programs that have yielded humanity's richest insights into the red planet and given both scientists and storytellers like Andy Weir the foundation to imagine what it must be like to stand on Mars' surface at all.\nThis edited article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Will we ever reach Alpha Centauri, our closest neighboring star system?\nVisiting our nearest stellar neighbor will take near-light-speed travel.\nOur space-exploration ambitions have boldly taken humans to the moon, rovers to Mars and spacecraft to the outer reaches of the solar system. But could humans or spacecraft ever reach Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to our planet?\nAlpha Centauri is about 4.4 light-years (roughly 25 trillion miles, or 40 trillion kilometers) from Earth and is home to three separate stars. The closest star, Proxima Centauri, also hosts an exoplanet that scientists believe could have the conditions necessary for life.\nBut reaching this star system would be no small feat. NASA estimates that, using a space shuttle like NASA's now-retired 122-foot-long (38 meters) Discovery, it would take close to 150,000 years to reach Alpha Centauri.\nIf humans could travel at the speed of light, we could reach Alpha Centauri in four years flat. However, the laws of physics dictate that only massless light particles called photons can reach this cosmic speed limit. So, while humans will probably never reach Alpha Centauri, it's possible that spacecraft designed to go a much smaller fraction of the speed of light could reach these stars in a human lifetime. To even hope of getting a spacecraft up to top speed, scientists will need something much smaller than Discovery.\nMarshall Eubanks, CEO of the startup Space Initiatives Inc and a fellow at NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts, is researching remote methods for visiting Proxima Centauri using swarms of spacecraft with masses of less than 0.02 ounces per square foot (10 grams per square meter).\nRelated: What could aliens look like?\n\"We are in the midst of a real revolution in space flight and space exploration, with extremely small systems,\" Eubanks told Live Science in an email. \"While an individual small spacecraft will not be as capable as a larger spacecraft, such as the Voyagers, their development times are much shorter; they are relatively inexpensive.\"\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nTiny spacecraft also require less power to propel them, which could be a key advantage in increasing their speed.\nEubanks isn't the only one pursuing this kind of research. Breakthrough Initiatives started its Starshot project in 2016 to combine nanometer-sized spacecraft with light sails, and in 2017, NASA began funding its own project targeted at launching a mission to Alpha Centauri by 2069, 100 years after Apollo 11.\nWhile small spacecraft are easier to accelerate than larger probes, traditional fuel sources alone are not powerful or plentiful enough to push these craft to near light speed. Instead, Philip Lubin, a professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara whose ideas for interstellar travel inspired the Starshot team, told Live Science that these craft will likely rely on light instead.\nSolar energy\nTo go fast in space, it helps to be small and have low mass. One major benefit of light-powered propulsion is that it's mass-less, Lubin said. Traditional rocket fuel, in contrast, creates propulsion by transforming heavy fuel into energy by burning it. Using either a solar sail, which is propelled by the sun's light, or a photonic sail, which is propelled by laser light, gives you all of the power without any of the weight.\nLubin said you can think of it like throwing a ball at a piece of paper. When a ball strikes the paper, it will apply a force, causing the paper to recoil or be pushed away. Similarly, the momentum carried by light is transferred to the spacecraft, which causes it to recoil and accelerate.\n\"The system is basically a gigantic flashlight \u2014 it's a giant laser array [on Earth],\" Lubin said. If the spacecraft are sailboats, then the laser light is the wind in their sails.\nTechnology to create and test these craft, such as communications equipment small enough to fit on them, is still being developed. But there's no physical reason to believe that such a spacecraft couldn't conduct a flyby mission of Alpha Centauri, Lubin said.\nThis mission could behave much like the Voyager 1 and 2 probes and transmit high-resolution images of the star system back to Earth, some of which might contain our first look at Proxima Centauri's potentially habitable planet.\nWhile Lubin stressed that a journey to Alpha Centauri would be a long-term endeavor, Eubanks said he's confident that big advances could come this century.\n\"I think that we will reach the Alpha Centauri system, with small probes launching in the decade of the 2040s, and thus arriving in the 2060s,\" Eubanks said. \"Significantly larger probes should be possible by the end of the century, but without unexpected breakthroughs in propulsion physics, I think that crewed missions will be a task for the next century.\"\nEditor's note: This article was updated at 5:11 pm EDT on July 30 to correct the size of the planned spacecraft from Space Initiative Inc.\nSarah is a D.C.-based independent science journalist interested in the philosophical questions of science and technology and how research intersects with our daily lives.

      "text": "What are centrifugal and centripetal forces?\nLearn the key differences between centripetal and centrifugal forces, their real-world applications in physics, and how they shape our understanding of circular motion.\nCentripetal and centrifugal forces are two terms used to describe the physics of circular motion \u2014 but only one of them is real. The centripetal force keeps an object moving in a circle and is always pointed toward the center of that circle. For instance, the gravitational force of the sun is a centripetal force that keeps Earth orbiting it.\nMeanwhile, the centrifugal force is what's known as a fictitious force: It's an apparent outward force on an object that is moving in a circle. This phantom force can nevertheless feel very real if you are the one rotating. For instance, centrifugal force is a way to describe the sensation of flying outward that you get on a Gravitron and similar amusement park rides. Ultimately, these two rotational forces are two sides of the same coin.\n\"The difference between centripetal and centrifugal force has to do with different 'frames of reference' \u2014 that is, different viewpoints from which you measure something,\" said Andrew A. Ganse, a research physicist previously at the University of Washington. \"Centripetal force and centrifugal force are really the exact same force, just in opposite directions because they're experienced from different frames of reference.\"\nIf you're outside the rotating system, you would observe the centripetal force. From a rotating object's point of view \u2014 say, the laundry spinning in a washing machine \u2014 you would experience centrifugal force.\nWhat is the difference between centripetal and centrifugal force?\nCentripetal force and centrifugal force are two ways of describing the same thing. The main differences between centripetal and centrifugal forces are the orientation, or direction, of the force and the frame of reference \u2014 whether you are tracking the force from a stationary point or from the rotating object's point of view.\nThe centripetal force points toward the center of a circle, keeping an object moving in a circular path. The word \"centripetal\" means \"center-seeking.\" The centrifugal force \u2014 which, again, is not real \u2014 makes it feel, for a rotating object, as if something is pushing it outward, away from the circle's center, according to Christopher S. Baird, an associate professor of physics at West Texas A&M University.\nIs centrifugal force real?\nWhile centripetal force is an actual force, centrifugal force is an apparent force. In other words, when you twirl a rock tied on a string, the string exerts an inward centripetal force on the rock, while from the rock's point of view, there appears to be an outward centrifugal force on the string.\nIf you are observing a rotating system from the outside, you see an inward centripetal force acting to constrain the rotating body to a circular path.\nHowever, if you are whirling around on a Gravitron, you experience an apparent centrifugal force pushing you away from the center of the circle. What you are feeling is the inward centripetal force that is keeping you from going off on a tangent.\nImagine riding in a car taking a banked turn. If you're watching from the outside, you can observe the centripetal force pushing the car inward toward the center, keeping it moving in a circle. But if you're riding inside the car, you instead feel a force pushing you away from the center of the circle \u2014 this is the centrifugal force.\nWhat are real-life examples of centripetal and centrifugal force?\nA simple real-life example of centripetal force is a rock tied to a string. When the string is swirled around, the tension in that string keeps the rock from flying off in a straight line. That tension points inward, toward the center of the circle.\nAs another example, the sun's gravity provides the centripetal force that keeps the planets rotating around our central star.\nCentrifugal force describes the feeling you get when rounding a corner in a car or when an airplane banks into a turn. Centrifugal force occurs in the spin cycle of a washing machine or when children ride on an amusement park ride.\nAnother practical application of centripetal force is the laboratory centrifuge, which is used to accelerate liquid suspensions. Centrifuges are key tools used in blood sample analysis.\nNormally, thermal motion causes continuous mixing, which prevents gravity from forcing blood cells to settle out into different layers. However, a typical laboratory centrifuge can achieve accelerations 600 to 2,000 times that of gravity. This strong acceleration makes heavy red blood cells settle at the bottom of a sample and stratifies the various components of the solution into layers according to their density.\nHow do you calculate centripetal and centrifugal force?\nCentripetal force emerges from Newton's laws of motion. If a massive body is moving through space in a straight line, its inertia will cause it to continue in a straight line unless an outside force causes it to speed up, slow down or change direction.\nHere's how centripetal force is calculated:\nFor the object to follow a circular path without changing speed, a continuous centripetal force must be applied at a right angle to its path. The radius (r) of this circle is equal to the mass (m) times the square of the velocity (v) divided by the centripetal force (F), or r = mv^2/F. The force can be calculated by simply rearranging the equation: F= mv^2/r.\nNewton's third law states that \"for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\" Just as gravity causes you to exert a force on the ground, the ground appears to exert an equal and opposite force on your feet. When you are in an accelerating car, the seat exerts a forward force on you just as you appear to exert a backward force on the seat.\nIn the case of a rotating system, the centripetal force pulls the mass inward to follow a curved path, while the mass appears to push outward due to its inertia. In each of these cases, though, there is only one real force being applied, while the other is only an apparent force.\nThe formula for centrifugal force is the same as the formula for centripetal force.\nCentripetal force in space exploration\nMost things in space move roughly in a circle, so centripetal force plays a big role in space exploration. It governs how satellites orbit our planet, how the moon orbits Earth, and how the rest of the solar system's planets orbit the sun.\nThis rotational force is also used to simulate the acceleration of a space launch for astronaut training. When a rocket is first launched, it is so laden with fuel and oxidizer that it can barely move. However, as it ascends, it burns fuel at a tremendous rate, continuously losing mass. Newton's second law states that force equals mass times acceleration, or F = ma.\nIn most situations, mass remains constant. With a rocket, though, its mass changes drastically, while the force \u2014 in this case, the thrust of the rocket motors \u2014 remains nearly constant. This causes the acceleration toward the end of the boost phase to increase to several times that of normal gravity. NASA uses large, spinning wheels called centrifuges to prepare astronauts for this extreme acceleration. In this application, the centripetal force is provided by the back of the seat pushing inward on the astronaut.\nCentrifugal force, meanwhile, could create the illusion of gravity in a future space station. If you rotate a spacecraft via centripetal force, you create an acceleration that will be felt as centrifugal force. This effect can create artificial gravity, assuming the craft spins fast enough.\nLearn more about centripetal and centrifugal force\nYou can read more about the basics of centripetal force from the Swinburne University of Technology. SciShow provides a great video introduction to the topic where they explain and compare centripetal and centrifugal forces. Or you can watch an astronaut describe centripetal force from the International Space Station.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n- Tia GhoseManaging Editor"

      "text": "China's 'artificial sun' shatters nuclear fusion record by generating steady loop of plasma for 1,000 seconds\nA nuclear fusion reactor in China, dubbed the \"artificial sun,\" has broken its own record to bring humanity one step closer to near-limitless clean energy.\nChina's \"artificial sun\" reactor has broken its own world record for maintaining super-hot plasma, marking another milestone in the long road towards near-limitless clean energy.\nThe Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) nuclear fusion reactor maintained a steady, highly confined loop of plasma \u2014 the high-energy fourth state of matter \u2014 for 1,066 seconds on Monday (Jan. 20), which more than doubled its previous best of 403 seconds, Chinese state media reported.\nNuclear fusion reactors are nicknamed \"artificial suns\" because they generate energy in a similar way to the sun \u2014 by fusing two light atoms into a single heavy atom via heat and pressure. The sun has a lot more pressure than Earth's reactors, so scientists compensate by using temperatures that are many times hotter than the sun.\nNuclear fusion offers the potential of a near-unlimited power source without greenhouse gas emissions or much nuclear waste. However, scientists have been working on this technology for more than 70 years, and it's likely not progressing fast enough to be a practical solution to the climate crisis. Researchers expect us to have fusion power within decades, but it could take much longer.\nEAST's new record won't immediately usher in what is dubbed the \"Holy Grail\" of clean power, but it is a step towards a possible future where fusion power plants generate electricity.\nEast is a magnetic confinement reactor, or tokamak, designed to keep the plasma continuously burning for prolonged periods. Reactors like this have never achieved ignition, which is the point at which nuclear fusion creates its own energy and sustains its own reaction, but the new record is a step towards maintaining prolonged, confined plasma loops that future reactors will need to generate electricity.\n\"A fusion device must achieve stable operation at high efficiency for thousands of seconds to enable the self-sustaining circulation of plasma, which is critical for the continuous power generation of future fusion plants,\" Song Yuntao, director of the Institute of Plasma Physics responsible for the fusion project at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told Chinese state media.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nEAST is one of several nuclear fusion reactors worldwide, but they all currently use far more energy than they produce. In 2022, the U.S. National Ignition Facility's fusion reactor briefly achieved ignition in its core using a different experimental method to EAST, relying on quick bursts of energy, but the reactor as a whole still used more energy than it consumed.\nTokamaks like EAST are the most common nuclear fusion reactors. EAST heats up plasma and traps it inside a donut-shaped reactor chamber \u2014 called the tokamak \u2014 with powerful magnetic fields. For the latest record, researchers made several upgrades to the reactor, including doubling the power of its heating system, according to Chinese state media.\nThe data gathered by EAST will support the development of other reactors, both in China and internationally. China is part of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) program, which involves dozens of countries, including the U.S., U.K. Japan, South Korea and Russia.\nThe ITER reactor, which is being built in southern France, contains the world's most powerful magnet and will fire up in 2039 at the earliest. ITER will be an experimental tool designed to create sustained fusion for research purposes, but could pave the way for fusion power plants.\n\"We hope to expand international collaboration via EAST and bring fusion energy into practical use for humanity,\" Song said.\nPatrick Pester is the trending news writer at Live Science.

      "text": "Spacecraft carrying cannabis and human remains crashes into the ocean\nA capsule created by German aerospace startup The Exploration Company crash-landed in the ocean with a payload that included human remains and cannabis seeds.\nWe've sent some pretty interesting payloads to space since the first satellite (Sputnik 1) launched on October 4th, 1957. As access to space has increased, thanks largely to the commercial space industry, so too have the types of payloads we are sending.\nConsider the Nyx capsule created by German aerospace startup The Exploration Company, which launched on June 23rd from the Vandenberg Space Force Base atop a Falcon-9 rocket as part of a rideshare mission (Transporter-14). The payload for this flight (dubbed \"Mission Possible\") included the ashes and DNA of more than 166 deceased people provided by Celestis, a Texas-based memorial spaceflight company.\nWhile the mission achieved orbit and a controlled reentry, the capsule's landing parachutes failed to deploy before landing. This caused the Nyx capsule to crash in the Pacific Ocean on June 24th, causing all of its cargo to be lost at sea. This was the first time The Exploration Company sent customer payloads to space, equivalent to roughly 300 kg (660 lbs) of cargo. In a statement posted on LinkedIn, the company described the flight as a \"partial success (partial failure).\" Per their statement:\nThe capsule was launched successfully, powered the payloads nominally in-orbit, stabilized itself after separation with the launcher, re-entered and re-established communication after black out. But it encountered an issue afterwards, based on our current best knowledge, and we lost communication a few minutes before splashdown. We are still investigating the root causes and will share more information soon. We apologize to all our clients who entrusted us with their payloads.\nWe thank our teams for their hard work and their dedication to success. We have been pushing boundaries in record time and cost. This partial success reflects both ambition and the inherent risks of innovation. Leveraging the technical milestones achieved yesterday and the lessons we will extract from our ongoing investigation, we will then prepare to re-fly as soon as possible.\nThis is also the second time Celestis has lost a payload, the previous having taken place in 2023 when a rocket containing the cremated remains of the late NASA astronaut Philip K. Chapman exploded over New Mexico. Celestis also released a statement of condolences to the families of the people whose remains were lost:\nIn the coming days, our team will reach out to each family individually to offer support and discuss possible next steps. Though we currently believe that we cannot return the flight capsules, we hope families will find some peace in knowing their loved ones were part of a historic journey, launched into space, orbited Earth, and are now resting in the vastness of the Pacific, akin to a traditional and honored sea scattering.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nIn addition to the human remains and other payloads, Nyx also carried cannabis plant matter and seeds provided by Martian Grow, an open-source citizen science project. The purpose was to study the effects of microgravity on the germination and resilience, potentially providing insight into how life could adapt and fare in the Martian environment. The first, Mission Bikini, launched a smaller reentry capsule in July 2024 atop an Ariane 6 rocket, but the capsule remained in orbit after the rocket's upper stage failed to launch it on its reentry trajectory.\nThis latest mission aimed to test key technologies and verify the Nyx capsule's ability to transport cargo to space. It is hoped that future iterations of the capsule will fly spacecraft to destinations in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), including the International Space Station (ISS) and/or its successor stations. To this end, the company plans to conduct a demonstration flight to the ISS in 2028, which is pending support from the European Space Agency. In the meantime, the company plans to move forward and incorporate the lessons of this latest mission.\nThe original version of this article was published on Universe Today.\nMatt Williams is a science communicator, journalist, writer, and educator with over 20 years of experience in education and outreach.

      "text": "China is investigating how to build ultra-large spacecraft that are up to 0.6 mile (1 kilometer) long. But how feasible is the idea, and what would be the use of such a massive spacecraft?\nThe project is part of a wider call for research proposals from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, a funding agency managed by the country's Ministry of Science and Technology. A research outline posted on the foundation's website described such enormous spaceships as \"major strategic aerospace equipment for the future use of space resources, exploration of the mysteries of the universe, and long-term living in orbit.\"\nThe foundation wants scientists to conduct research into new, lightweight design methods that could limit the amount of construction material that has to be lofted into orbit, and new techniques for safely assembling such massive structures in space. If funded, the feasibility study would run for five years and have a budget of 15 million yuan ($2.3 million).\nRelated: Interstellar space travel: 7 futuristic spacecraft to explore the cosmos\nThe project might sound like science fiction, but former NASA chief technologist Mason Peck said the idea isn't entirely off the wall, and the challenge is more a question of engineering than fundamental science.\n\"I think it's entirely feasible,\" Peck, now a professor of aerospace engineering at Cornell University, told Live Science. \"I would describe the problems here not as insurmountable impediments, but rather problems of scale.\"\nBy far the biggest challenge would be the price tag, noted Peck, due to the huge cost of launching objects and materials into space. The International Space Station (ISS), which is only 361 feet (110 meters) wide at its widest point according to NASA, cost roughly $100 billion to build, Peck said, so constructing something 10 times larger would strain even the most generous national space budget.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nMuch depends on what kind of structure the Chinese plan to build, though. The ISS is packed with equipment and is designed to accommodate humans, which significantly increases its mass. \"If we're talking about something that is simply long and not also heavy then it's a different story,\" Peck said.\nBuilding techniques could also reduce the cost of getting a behemoth spaceship into space. The conventional approach would be to build components on Earth and then assemble them like Legos in orbit, said Peck, but 3D-printing technology could potentially turn compact raw materials into structural components of much larger dimensions in space.\nAn even more attractive option would be to source raw materials from the moon, which has low gravity compared with Earth, meaning that launching materials from its surface into space would be much easier, according to Peck. Still, that first requires launch infrastructure on the moon and is therefore not an option in the short term.\nBig spaceship, big problems\nA structure of such massive proportions will also face unique problems. Whenever a spacecraft is subjected to forces, whether from maneuvering in orbit or docking with another vehicle, the motion imparts energy to the spaceship's structure that causes it to vibrate and bend, Peck explained. With such a large structure, these vibrations will take a long time to subside so it's likely the spacecraft will require shock absorbers or active control to counteract those vibrations, he said.\nDesigners will also have to make careful trade-offs when deciding what altitude the spacecraft should orbit at, Peck said. At lower altitudes, drag from the outer atmosphere slows vehicles down, requiring them to constantly boost themselves back into a stable orbit. This is already an issue for the ISS, Peck noted, but for a much larger structure, which has more drag acting on it and would require more fuel to boost back into place, it would be a major concern.\nOn the flip side, launching to higher altitudes is much more expensive, and radiation levels increase quickly the further from Earth's atmosphere an object gets, which will be a problem if the spacecraft houses humans.\nBut while building such a structure might be technically possible, it's not feasible in any practical sense, said Michael Lembeck, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who has worked on both government and commercial space programs.\n\"It's kind of like us talking about building the Starship Enterprise,\" he told Live Science. \"It's fantastical, not feasible, and fun to think about, but not very realistic for our level of technology,\" given the cost, he said.\nGiven the research project's tiny budget, it is likely only meant to be a small, academic study to map out the very earliest contours of such a project and identify technological gaps, Lembeck said. For comparison, the budget to build a capsule to take astronauts to the ISS was $3 billion. \"So the level of effort here is extremely small compared to the outcomes that are desired,\" he added.\nThere are also questions about what such a big spacecraft would be used for. Lembeck said possibilities include space manufacturing facilities that take advantage of microgravity and abundant solar power to build high-value products like semiconductors and optical equipment, or long-term habitats for off-world living. But both would entail enormous maintenance costs.\n\"The space station is a $3 billion a year enterprise,\" Lembeck added. \"Multiply that for larger facilities and it quickly becomes a rather large, expensive enterprise to pull off.\"\nChina has also expressed interest in building enormous solar power arrays in orbit and beaming the power back to Earth via microwave beams, but Peck said the economics of such a project just don't stack up. Peck has done some back-of-the-envelope calculations and estimates it would cost around $1,000 per watt, compared with just $2 per watt for energy generated from solar panels on Earth.\nPerhaps the most promising application for such a large space structure would be scientific, Peck said. A space telescope of that scale could potentially see features on the surface of planets in other solar systems. \"That could be transformative for our understanding of extrasolar planets and potentially life in the universe,\" he added.\nOriginal article on Live Science."
