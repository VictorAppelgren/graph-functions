  "description": "Smart data capture goes beyond mobile to maximize ROI",
  "content": "The landscape of smart data capture software is undergoing a significant transformation, with advancements that can help businesses build long-term resilience against disruptions like trade tariffs, labor shortages, and volatile demand.\n\nNo longer confined to handheld computers and mobile devices, the technology is embracing a new batch of hybrid data capture methods that include fixed cameras, drones, and wearables.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t familiar with smart data capture, it is the ability to capture data intelligently from barcodes, text, IDs, and objects. It enables real-time decision-making, engagement, and workflow automation at scale across industries such as retail, supply chain, logistics, travel, and healthcare.\n\nThe advancements it\u2019s currently experiencing are beyond technological novelties; they are further redefining how businesses operate, driving ROI, enhancing customer experience, and streamlining operational workflows. Let\u2019s explore how:\n\nMore than just smartphones\n\nTraditionally, smart data capture relied heavily on smartphones and handheld computers, devices that both captured data and facilitated user action. With advancements in technology, the device landscape is expanding. Wearables like smart glasses and headsets, fixed cameras, drones, and even robots are becoming more commonplace, each with its own value.\n\nThis diversification leads to the distinction of devices that purely \u2018capture\u2019 data versus those that can \u2018act\u2019 on it too. For example, stationary cameras or drones capture data from the real world and then feed it into a system of record to be aggregated with other data.\n\nOther devices \u2014 often mobile or wearable \u2014 can capture data and empower users to act on that information instantly, such as a store associate who scans a shelf and can instantly be informed of a pricing error on a particular item. Depending on factors such as the frequency of data collected, these devices can allow enterprises to tailor a data capture strategy to their needs.\n\nIn a market saturated with emerging technologies, it's easy to get caught up in the hype of the next big thing. However, not all innovations are ready for prime time, and many fail to deliver a tangible return on investment, especially at scale. The key for businesses is to focus on practical, easy-to-implement solutions that enhance workflows rather than disrupt them by leveraging existing technologies and IT infrastructure.\n\nAn illustrative example of this evolution is the increasing use of fixed cameras in conjunction with mobile devices for shelf auditing and monitoring in retail environments. Retailers are deploying mobile devices and fixed cameras to monitor shelves in near real-time and identify out-of-stock items, pricing errors, and planogram discrepancies, freeing up store associates\u2019 time and increasing revenue \u2014 game-changing capabilities in the current volatile trade environment, which triggers frequent price changes and inventory challenges.\n\nThis hybrid shelf management approach allows businesses to scale operations no matter the store format: retailers can easily pilot the solution using their existing mobile devices with minimal upfront investment and assess all the expected ROI and benefits before committing to full-scale implementation.\n\nThe combination also enables further operational efficiency, with fixed cameras providing continuous and fully automated shelf monitoring in high-footfall areas, while mobile devices can handle lower-frequency monitoring in less-frequented aisles.\n\nThis is how a leading European grocery chain increased revenue by 2% in just six months \u2014 an enormous uplift in a tight-margin vertical like grocery.\n\nAn important aspect of this data capture evolution is the seamless integration of all these various devices and technologies. User interfaces are being developed to facilitate multi-device interactions, ensuring that data captured by one system can be acted upon through another.\n\nFor example, fixed cameras might continuously monitor inventory levels, with alerts to replenish specific low-stock items sent directly to a worker's wearable device for immediate and hands-free action.\n\nAnd speaking of hands-free operation: gesture recognition and voice input are also becoming increasingly important, especially for wearable devices lacking traditional touchscreens. Advancing these technologies would enable workers to interact with items naturally and efficiently.\n\nAdaptive user interfaces also play a vital role, ensuring consistent experiences across different devices and form factors. Whether using a smartphone, tablet, or digital eyewear, the user interface should adapt to provide the necessary functionality without a steep learning curve; otherwise, it may negatively impact the adoption rate of the data capture solution.\n\nRecognizing the benefits, a large US grocer implemented a pre-built adaptive UI to enable top-performing scanning capabilities on existing apps to 100 stores in just 90 days.\n\nAs the volume of data increases, so does the potential for information overload. In some cases, systems can generate thousands of alerts daily, overwhelming staff and hindering productivity. To combat this, businesses are adopting so-called co-pilot systems \u2014 a combination of devices and advanced smart data capture that can guide workers to prioritize ROI-optimizing tasks.\n\nThis combination leverages machine learning to analyze sales numbers, inventory levels, and other critical metrics, providing frontline workers with actionable insights. By focusing on high-priority tasks, employees can work more efficiently without sifting through endless lists of alerts.\n\nAs the smart data capture landscape continues to evolve and disruption becomes the \u201cnew normal\u201d, businesses must ensure their technology stacks are flexible, adaptable, and scalable.\n\nSupporting various devices, integrating multiple data signals, and providing clear task prioritization are essential for staying competitive in an increasingly complex, changeable and data-driven market.\n\nBy embracing hybrid smart data capture device strategies, businesses can optimize processes, enhance user experiences, and make informed decisions based on real-time data.\n\nThe convergence of mobile devices, fixed cameras, wearables, drones, and advanced user interfaces represents not just an evolution in technology but a revolution in how businesses operate. And in a world where data is king, those who capture it effectively \u2014 and act on it intelligently \u2014 will lock in higher margins today and lead the way tomorrow.\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "The path to Agentic AI: overcoming complexity to embrace the autonomous enterprise\nEmpowering enterprise operations with autonomous AI agents\nThe future of enterprise AI isn\u2019t just about insights \u2013 it\u2019s about a monumental evolution of how businesses buy and sell in the global economy.\nAI agents are poised to take automation beyond any capabilities that we\u2019ve witnessed to date, shifting from AI tools that assist decision-making to independently thinking entities that augment execution at scale.\nDeloitte predicts that by 2027, half of all companies will use GenAI to launch agentic AI pilots or proofs of concept, marking a significant transformation in how businesses operate.\nCTO and Co-Founder, Icertis.\nChallenges on the Path to Agentic Adoption\nWhile agentic AI holds immense promise, organizations must first overcome multiple hurdles. Case in point: Another recent survey found that more than 85 percent of enterprises will require upgrades to their existing technology stack in order to deploy AI agents. Most businesses are still in the early stages of AI adoption, and scaling agentic workflows from initial investments to drive enterprise-wide ROI remains a major challenge.\nThe road to agentic AI requires rethinking IT infrastructure, ensuring seamless and quality data integration, addressing security and compliance risks, and fostering organizational trust in autonomous solutions \u2013 all while ensuring the right guardrails are in place. Without a well-defined strategy, companies risk inefficiencies, implementation barriers, reputational risk, and missed opportunities to harness AI's full potential.\nComplexity in Scaling\nAgents individually aren\u2019t enough. They can\u2019t be deployed in isolation and need to work in coordination across systems to execute complex multi-step processes \u2013 manifesting as agentic workflows. Unlike monolithic systems with predictable interactions, an agentic workflow orchestrates a network of AI agents to solve intricate and layered problems autonomously with machine-scale analysis and human in the loop decision making.\nBusinesses need advanced orchestration frameworks capable of managing these complex interactions, ensuring robust error handling and maintaining workflow continuity across teams. Developing a clear roadmap will be critical in helping organizations deploy and scale AI agents effectively.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nAccountability and Governance\nWith multiple agentic workflows operating independently yet collaboratively, ensuring accountability is a major challenge. Without a well-defined governance model, businesses risk a lack of oversight, which can lead to noncompliance, financial discrepancies, and reduced trust in AI-driven processes. Agents need to understand the rules of business that humans follow \u2013 rules that are defined by legal frameworks, ethical practices, and captured in contracts between customers, suppliers, and partners.\nBy \u201cgut checking\u201d decisions against contractual terms before taking action and ensuring clear audit trails are in place across the business, agentic decision-making becomes transparent and traceable, and far less likely to result in unnecessary liability.\nEnsuring Data and Privacy\nIn any enterprise system, it\u2019s critical for organizations to handle sensitive information responsibly and securely. Before deploying agentic workflows, ensure that data is clean and structured so sensitive information may be used by multiple agents simultaneously without exposure.\nThis applies to bank account details that are necessary for supplier payments, employee personal information, and contract data, as prime examples. Businesses should also establish secure data pipelines and continuous compliance measures to mitigate risks while enabling AI agents to function effectively and responsibly.\nTrust and Change Management\nAdopting agentic workflows requires more than just technical capability \u2013 it demands cultural change. Many organizations struggle with trusting AI agents due to concerns about reliability, accuracy, bias, ethical implications, and lack of transparency.\nIn fact, a recent study revealed data output quality and security and privacy concerns are among the top 10 barriers to AI adoption. Resistance to change within organizations, combined with a lack of understanding of how AI agents work, can create obstacles.\nFor businesses to fully embrace agentic AI, increase AI literacy and awareness around how AI agents operate with internal training and a top-down call to action driven by leadership. Emphasizing security protocols and privacy protections will also help to build confidence.\nThe First Step Toward an Autonomous Enterprise\nSo where can businesses realize immediate value from AI agents and agentic workflows?\nAI agents are only as good as the data they train on. If enterprises want to drive profitability and capture returns from their AI strategy, they should start by looking at the data that drives the flow of commerce. Commercial agreements and the critical data they contain are foundational to how enterprises buy and sell, while also providing the compliance constraints agents need to do their jobs well without adding layers of risk.\nThe path to agentic AI is not a straight line. Yet by strategically addressing challenges, businesses can unlock new levels of intelligence and operational efficiency to embrace their future as an autonomous enterprise.\nWe list the best performance management software.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best employee time tracking software of 2025\nOur comprehensive rundown of the best employee time-tracking software will make time and payroll management easier for your organization.\n1. Best overall\n2. Best automatic\n3. Best report-oriented\n4. Best AI-powered\n5. Best remote\n6. FAQs\n7. How we test\nThe best time-tracking tool has become indispensable for modern businesses, more so for organizations paying employees and billing clients based on the time spent on a project. These tools help you record how much time your employees spend on various parts of a project, which tells you if any aspect is being ignored and re-tune your resources accordingly.\nA robust time tracking software also comes with various company-wide and employee-wise reports that help you monitor employee and team productivity. It also helps managers evaluate employee performance and help them align their goals with that of the organization at large.\nHowever, finding a reliable time-tracking tool that gets the job done can be difficult, given that there are hundreds of options available. At Techradar, we\u2019ve reviewed and compared tons of providers to present to you with our carefully crafted list. Read through our comprehensive review of the best time-tracking software that will help you streamline time management within your team.\nWe've also featured the best employee recognition software.\nThe best employee time tracking software in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest overall\n1. Clockify\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nClockify is a free time management app and web solution that comes with a host of other employee management tools such as scheduling, timesheets, time-off, expense management, scheduling, and reporting dashboards, among others.\nWhat I absolutely loved about Clockify is its kiosk login feature, which lets your employees clock in from their own devices via a link. Managers can create a kiosk link from the \u201cKiosk\u201d tab on their dashboard.\nName the kiosk, add members who will log in using the kiosk, and select the project. You can even require your employees to enter a pin to clock in and out via the kiosk. Once done, click on Create, and you\u2019ll get a kiosk link.\nEmployees can open this link on their own devices. They can even pin the link as an icon on their home screens. To clock in, employees need to open the link, select themselves from the option of employees, enter their PIN code, and clock in. They also have the option to take a break, during which the timer can be paused.\nWith 80+ options, Clockify offers an extensive integration library (which is just behind Toggl Track). Some popular integrations include Trello, Asana, Monday, Wrike, QuickBooks, Airtable, HubSpot, and Google Sheets.\nClockify\u2019s approval mechanism is also one of the best in the business. Employees can enter their weekly timesheets and submit them for approval to their managers and admins. While managers can approve timesheets of only their employees, admins can do so for everyone.\nEmployees can even edit the timesheets after submission if they have forgotten an entry. However, you can choose to lock timesheets for a certain period after submission to avoid too many edits.\nManagers can also conduct extensive time audits, which can be accessed from the \u201cReports\u201d tab. You can enter various filters to check if any employee has logged in more than the usual hours or if someone has entered too few hours. You can also mark entries and billable and non-billable and correct mistakes, if any.\nIt might happen that someone has forgotten to log in their time. To view this, you need to view the report grouped by \u201cuser,\u201d and at the bottom, you\u2019ll find an option - \u201cshow users without time.\u201d You can remind them to log in time or do so yourself by searching up the employee\u2019s timesheet on the search bar.\nSometimes, employees log in their time but forget to submit the same. You can view this data as well from the \u201cUnsubmitted\u201d option on the \u201cApproval\u201d tab. As you can see, there are a lot of controls managers can exercise to ensure accurate time tracking.\nBest automatic\n2. TimeCamp\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTimeCamp is known for its automatic keyword-based time-tracking mode, which eliminates the need to start and stop time tracking every time you switch activities. Visit the Projects Module of your TimeCamp desktop app and add a list of various tasks relevant to you. Next, assign some keywords to these tasks by clicking on the enable keyword option. For example, the task \u201ctraining\u201d may include keywords like meet, google, conference, asana, livechatinc, and so on. After that, select the auto mode of tracking by right-clicking the desktop icon. Now, you\u2019re all set,\nTimeCamp will now detect the keywords in the title of the websites and applications you\u2019re working on and automatically classify your time between different tasks. If any task remains unclassified, you can manually do so at the end of the day.\nJust like HubStaff, TimeCamp also has impressive geo-fencing-based location tracking and time recording. However, everything you can do with HubStaff can be done with TimeCamp without any costs on its free plan. While geofencing is available as a paid add-on with HubStaff, TimeCamp provides it for free. In fact, TimeCamp has a decent free plan. Features like idle time tracking, time clock kiosks, auto tracking, 10+ time tracking reports, and 80+ integrations and plugins make it ideal for small businesses and startups.\nTalking about integrations, you can connect TimeCamp to a host of apps like CRM tools, accounting and invoicing software, helpdesk tools, and various project management and collaboration platforms. These extensive integrations help you streamline your entire work, and you won\u2019t have to run from software to software reconciling the same events.\nWhile TimeCamp is a capable free time tracker, features like screenshots, custom reports, approvals, invoicing, and others are available only on paid plans.\nApart from time tracking, TimeCamp also offers another platform \u2014 TimePlanner, that helps managers manage a large team through tools like Kanban boards, resource and project planning, to-do lists, team calendars, and file sharing. When coupled with TimeCamp, teams can leverage TimePlanner to seamlessly log time across projects while maintaining uninterrupted team communication.\nBest report-oriented\n3. Toggl Track\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nToggl Track lets you organize and record your time based on not only projects and tasks but also specific clients. Before starting recording time, employees have the option to choose the project they\u2019re logging time for and also the client they are working on, which makes billing very easy.\nThe provider comes with a QR code scanning feature to help employees log in their time by simply scanning these codes. These QR codes contain information such as project description, billable status, client, and workspace. Employees can generate these QR codes by tapping on Entry and then clicking on \u201cGenerate QR Code.\u201d\nNext, they simply need to scan the code to start the timer. This feature comes in handy for traveling employees and on-site workers, who might forget to log in their time when on the move. They can generate the code in the morning, before leaving for work, and simply scan them when they reach their work location.\nPomodoro timers are another Toggl Track feature worth mentioning. If you\u2019re working on a hyper-focus mode, you can enable the Pomodoro mode in Toggl Track. Pomodoro is a technique of focusing on a specific task for 25 minutes without distractions before taking a short break of 5 minutes.\nThis constitutes one Pomodoro cycle. Repeat the cycle 3-4 times until you finish the work in hand. And all the while you focus on your tasks, time will be recorded by Toggl Track.\nAnother thing I loved is Toggl Track's reporting and project tracking. You can filter reports by team, client, project, task, billable status, tag, and description and even choose a custom date range. The platform also gives you the option to round off the recorded time to the nearest minute (or any time interval you choose).\nIf you have a small team of up to 5 members, Toggl Track is free for you. You can track unlimited time on unlimited projects and clients.\nWhile other tools on the list also offer browser extensions to track time on various tools, Toggl Track raises the bar with 100+ supported integrations. Along with 10 native integrations, you can track time across 130+ platforms via extensions. ClickUp, Jira, Focuster, Google Docs, Kanbanist, LiquidPlanner, Odoo, Podio, Teamwork, and WordPress are a few examples.\nBest AI-powered\n4. Timely\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTimely believes in a clutter-free and creep-free approach to time-tracking, which is why they rely on their AI tool, Memory, to record employee time automatically. Memory, once installed on your desktop, will record the time spent on each activity on your system. You can view these recorded times in an attractive timeline view, with hourly breakdowns of your activities.\nYou now need to log time using Memory. To do so, visit the \u201chours\u201d tab on your Timely dashboard and click on \u201cNew Entry.\u201d You will now see the hour editor with your memory inbox on the right side. Select the project to which you want to add your time to.\nThen, simply drag and drop the tasks from your memory inbox to the project widget. You can edit, round off, and mark time as billable and non-billable before submitting. Once done, you can view the logged time in your timesheet.\nNow, here comes the best part. The more you log time using your Memory inbox, the smarter the AI becomes. It learns which tasks should be associated with which projects and produces automatic memory drafts for you. These Memory drafts appear on your timesheet in striped color boxes.\nClick on these boxes, and you can view various time logs assigned to your projects. You can edit, add, and remove tasks and edit times from various projects. Doing so repeatedly makes the AI more accurate with time, slowly automating your entire time-tracking process.\nHowever, like other timers on the list, Timely does not have a free plan. The basic plan starts at $9/user/month, with the ability to manage 20 projects.\nTimely also offers a simple time card that can help businesses with a handful of employees. If you have, say, less than 10 employees, you can use this weekly time card to manually enter the time in and out on each day to calculate the total time worked. Then, enter details like pay rate, overtime worked, and overtime rate.\nThe calculator will calculate the total pay you owe for the week. Plus, you can even download these time cards for future reference. This also comes in handy if you have hired a temporary worker and do not want to incorporate their details into your system.\nBest remote\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nHubStaff lets you capture screenshots of your employees' desktops every 10 minutes (or whatever interval you want) so that you know exactly what they\u2019re working on. Plus, employers can also track the apps and URLs visited by their employees. These tools make HubStaff ideal for tracking time for remote employees and other non-desk employees.\nHubStaff employee monitoring software also comes with GPS tracking, which will tell you where your employees are at a certain point in time. You can set geofences on the HubStaff software, marking your different job sites. Now, whenever an employee enters or leaves the job site, you\u2019ll get automated notifications.\nMoreover, time tracking will also be automatically started when they enter the site and stop when they leave. This feature prevents time theft and buddy punching and ensures there are no time-recording errors when paying your employees. It is also ideal for organizations with different locations and offices, as well as the construction industry.\nAll of this time recorded flows into employees\u2019 timesheets. Managers can add, edit, or delete recorded time, whereas employees have the option to add notes to explain the time recorded. Managers can use this timesheet to make automated employee payments.\nHubStaff offers four payment options to do so - Payoneer, PayPal, Transferwise, and Bitwage. Even if you do not want to use these modes, you can mark the time recorded as \u201cpaid\u201d to avoid duplicate entries and better record keeping.\nApart from this, you can avail of common features like automated timesheets, time-off, holidays and break management, and budget and project tracking.\nHowever, HubStaff isn\u2019t the cheapest time tracker out there. Its basic plan starts at $4.99/month with only limited screenshots, reports, and payments. Even if you upgrade the plan, you\u2019ll have to get separate add-ons for functions like smart notifications, work time classification, timeline view, and extra screenshots.\nPlus, it has a very limited free plan, only for a single user, which only serves as a medium to test the platform. Teams can\u2019t employ the free plan for regular timekeeping. However, HubStaff does make up for it with a 14-day free trial and a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nRead our full HubStaff review\nWe've also featured the best employee scheduling software.\nFAQs\nWhat is the best employee time tracking software?\nClockify is the best time-tracking tool with a feature-packed free forever plan. Apart from tracking employee time, you can view and approve their weekly timesheets to manage time off and employee expenses. Plus, managers have the option to record time via kiosk links, which is helpful for remote employees. With its 80+ app integrations, you can even track time on various third-party apps.\nHow to choose the best employee time tracking software?\nSelecting the best time-tracking tool involves paying attention to various aspects such as ease of use, free trials, and the extent of reports that can be generated. The ideal tool should provide enough flexibility to record overtime and allow employees to clock in break time. Managers must also be able to control and prevent buddy entries and set various time-tracking rules. Plus, features like GPS tracking and kiosk entries are a huge bonus.\nHow much does employee time tracking software cost?\nTime tracking tools can cost anywhere between $2.99-9 per user per month for the basic plan. These plans come with basic features like manual and automatic time tracking, timesheets, idle time detection, and basic reports. However, if you need more functions, such as time tracking audits, reminders, overtime tracking, and priority support, you\u2019ll need to shell out anything between $10-22/user/month.\nIs there a free employee time tracking software?\nYes, there are plenty of free time tracking options for you. TimeCamp has one of the best free plans on the market, with the ability to track time across unlimited projects and clients. You can access weekly timesheets and calenders and enable auto-tracking, kiosk tracking, and location-based tracking right from the free plan. These are some premium features for which you\u2019d need to buy a paid plan on other platforms.\nCan I track time with Google Sheets?\nYes, you can use Google Sheets to track time. Your different tasks can be listed in each row, with the start and end times in corresponding columns. Make sure you set the format to \u201cdate.\u201d In the next column, subtract both times to get the duration worked. It\u2019s worth noting that this is a manual-intensive task with no management control, which might be ideal for small startups, but we recommend using one of our top tools for full functionalities.\nHow we test\nChoosing an ideal time-tracking software is like picking a needle from a haystack due to the sheer amount of options at your disposal. However, our years of industry experience and a hands-on trial of different software helped us zero down on the best time-tracking software.\nFirst, we considered the ease of use. All of our picks require just clicking on a button to start and stop recording time. You can add various projects, sub-projects, and tasks to organize the recorded time.\nNext, we focused on the extent of reports generated by these platforms. Simply tracking time is of no use if that cannot be converted into meaningful reports. All our top picks generate various time reports and also lets you export them in various formats such as PDF, Excel, and so on. This simplifies employee data management.\nIntegrations are also an important part of time tracking. Data from time trackers must flow seamlessly into accounting, invoicing, and payroll platforms so that you don\u2019t have to scramble for data. Plus, it also saves you from data duplication and omission, which might either lead to overpayment or underpayment.\nLastly, we looked at some user reviews to understand the problems other users might be facing. Apart from a lack of operational know-how, we didn't find anything that might point to a flaw in our recommended platforms.\nWe've also featured the best employee management software.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "The best smart glasses 2025: the top AI and AR glasses you can find\nWe've tested AI and AR smart glasses, and these are the best\nWe've seen quite the shakeup here in the world of the best smart glasses. Not because of the launch of the Meta Orion AR glasses or Samsung and Google's Android XR glasses (they're both stioll some time from launch based on leaks) but because of some impressive specs you can buy today.\nThat's because the Xreal One and RayNeo Air 3s glasses have entered the numebr one and two slots on this list as the best AR smart glasses and best cheap AR smart glasses respectively.\nThey're superb glasses but the ones to really watch are the RayNeos as they're super affordable yet incredibly capable specs. If you've been waiting to buy a pair of AR smart glasses to make your commute more manageable these might the pair you've been waiting for.\nQuick list\nBest AR smart glasses\nWith impressive visuals, solid audio, and a new optical design that\u2019s sleeker and more effective than anything I \u2018ve tested before Xreal\u2019s glasses give us the future of smart glasses today.\nBest cheap AR smart glasses\nIf the Xreal specs are too pricey for your budget then these cheaper options from RayNeo could be just what you need thanks to their still solid visual and audio performance.\nBest Midrange AR smart glasses\nFor their price these smart glasses offer some of the best audio I\u2019ve heard from a pair of smart specs, excellent visuals, and a comfortable design that you can wear for hours at a time.\nBest AI smart glasses\nAfter a wearable AI instead of AR specs? Well, the Meta AI in these stylish Ray-Bans is pretty darn helpful, especially thanks to their camera-enhanced 'Look and Ask feature.'\nBest smart glasses for ChatGPT\nWhile their overall AI capabilities are not as impressive as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses', if you're married to ChatGPT these are the best glasses we've tried that offer hands-free access to it.\nBest smart home glasses\nMuch like the Lucyd glasses these specs aren't as impressive as Meta and Ray-Ban's smart glasses collab, but if you have plenty of Alexa-compatible smart home tech then there is some extra functionality to be found with the Echo Frames.\nThe best AR smart glasses in 2024\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBelow, you'll find full write-ups for the best smart glasses we've tested, along with links to our reviews for each of them.\nThe best AR smart glasses\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWhen I had finished testing the Xreal One glasses I declared them the best smart glasses you could buy, and prceeded to take them everywhere as my AR glasses of choice for wathcing shows and working on a giant virtual screen when I travel. As you\u2019d hope from an upgraded model, the Xreal One Pro glasses utterly bested them.\nWith a larger 57-degree field of view these boast one of the biggest pictures I've seen from AR smart glasses, and image which is further enhanced by its use of new Sony micro-OLED displays alongside a higher 700-nit perceived brightness. WIth a brighter picture colors are more vibrant, and contrast more noticable.\nJust like its counterpart elsewhere on this list ou can also look forward to the same solid audio tuned by Bose engineers, 120Hz 1080p visuals, an electrochromically dimmable lens backdrop, and a sleek design which helps make the Xreal Ones and now also the Xreal One Pros excellent.\nThe real succes here however is the new birdbath enhanced optical engine. This new method of light reflection is not only sleeker but more effective \u2013 both in terms of the visuals looking crisper with significantly less blurriness at the fringes, but also offering an easier to see through design which feels like it'll be crucial to the future of AR glasses.\nThe best cheap AR smart glasses\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThese are by far and away the best value for money AR smart glasses I\u2019ve tested.\nComing in at just $269 (they're only available in the US at the moment) these wearable displays punch well above their pay grade in every important regard.\nTheir dual-micro-OLED setup boasts solid color-accuracy and contrast to make your favorite shows and films pop, and as for the audio you can hear the improvements compared to their predecessors when it comes to producing midtones, highs, and bass.\nThe design is excellent too \u2013 finding a good balance between style and comfort.\nThat\u2019s not to say they\u2019re perfect, mind. There are times when the image can appear washed out because the mirrored outer lens acting as a backdrop for the display doesn\u2019t block out all external light, and you\u2019ll still want to consider using these glasses in conjunction with a pair of headphones.\nBut at such a low cost these AR glasses can be forgiven for having a few deficiencies, and overall they feel like they\u2019re something special \u2013 the first AR smart glasses I could recommend to most people.\nYou\u2019ll certainly get more if you spend more on alternatives like the Xreal One glasses above, but if you\u2019re not looking to break the bank, there\u2019s never been a better time to finally experience what these kinds of AR specs can do.\nThe best midrange AR smart glasses\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nI\u2019ve tested my fair share of AR smart glasses, and I was blown away when I tested the Xreal One glasses.\nThey boast a visually impressive full-HD 120Hz OLED with a 600-nit peak brightness. This leads to an image with vivid colors and excellent contrast, which is further aided by the lens\u2019 electrochromic dimming providing a deep black backdrop.\nUnlike most other smartspecs this model also delivers good sound thanks to audio courtesy of Bose. Headphones will still deliver better audio, but these smart glasses don\u2019t feel incomplete without a pair of cans \u2013 something I can\u2019t say of their rivals.\nJust note that if you\u2019re picking up the Xreal One you\u2019ll probably also want to grab Xreal\u2019s Beam Pro \u2013 a smartphone-like companion device that transforms your Xreal glasses setup into a complete spatial computing package (from an entertainment perspective).\nIt\u2019s not technically a requirement to use the Xreal One glasses \u2013 they\u2019re compatible with a host of other USB-C devices \u2013 but even the cheapest Beam Pro which starts at $199 / \u00a3189 for a model with 128GB of storage and 6GB of RAM feels like an essential add-on for these glasses if you want to maximise their performance.\nYou can also very easily hook the specs up to many USB-C smartphones, to your laptop, and to a game console if you have the right adapter (such as an HDMI to USB-C cable).\nAt $499 / \u00a3449 the Xreal One aren\u2019t the cheapest, but they more than justify their cost by offering premium performance, making them an easy pick for the best midrange option on this list; landing comfortably between their Pro model in the number one slot, and the affordable RayNeo Air 3S as our best budget pick.\nThe best AI smart glasses\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSmart glasses come in different forms, and rather than incorporating AR elements, these specs from Ray-Ban and Meta instead use AI \u2013 artificial intelligence \u2013 to earn their smart rating.\nWe\u2019ve been very impressed by the Meta AI, specifically its Look and Ask feature. Other AI-powered smart glasses simply let you talk to an AI like ChatGPT; you pose your question which is then relayed to a bot via your phone\u2019s internet connection (with the glasses being paired to your phone via Bluetooth).\nThe Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses do the same thing with a bonus feature. If you begin your prompt with \u201cHey Meta, look and\u2026\u201d they\u2019ll snap a pic of what you\u2019re seeing and use that image to inform any responses. It can struggle to find an answer and still make errors, but the hands-free nature and the ability to use images as context are exceptionally useful \u2013 with the Meta AI being better at mimicking a more human-like level of comprehension than we\u2019ve seen in rival smart glasses.\nThere are some issues to note with the specs, however. Chiefly the audio capabilities aren\u2019t anything to write home about if you\u2019re trying to use these smart glasses for music, and the camera as an actual camera for snapping pics isn\u2019t good enough to justify using it over the smartphone in your pocket. The only advantage it does offer is it\u2019s a convenient way to record first-person videos, or live stream to Meta platforms.\nDespite these flaws, the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are by far the best AI wearable we\u2019ve tested, and even on the AI\u2019s off-days (or when they\u2019re out of charge) the glasses will always be an exceptionally stylish pair of sunglasses that\u2019ll protect your eyes in the sun.\nThe best smart glasses for ChatGPT\n5. Lucyd glasses\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you want AI glasses that specifically rely on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT then instead of the Meta specs listed above you\u2019ll probably prefer the Lucyd Lyte smart glasses.\nBy downloading the Lucyd app, and connecting your phone to these smart glasses via Bluetooth, you can talk with ChatGPT and ask it questions with your voice that it\u2019ll respond to (provided you also have an internet connection). If you have an iPhone you\u2019ll be able to talk to ChatGPT completely hands-free using Siri \u2013 without waiting for Apple Intelligence to launch \u2013 while on Android you currently need to activate ChatGPT manually each time before you talk.\nJust note that unlike the Ray-Ban smart glasses above these lack a camera \u2013 so you won't be able to rely on GPT-4o\u2019s newly released equivalent to look and ask. What\u2019s more, unlike other AI models \u2013 like the Meta AI on the Ray-Bans \u2013 we found that these specs are only accurate to September 2023 because it doesn\u2019t have internet access and this was the last time ChatGPT\u2019s data was updated.\nDesign-wise, one factor we loved was the range of frame and lens styles afforded to us by the Lucyd Lyte smart glasses. Glasses aren\u2019t just functional, they\u2019re a fashion accessory, an extension of your personality, and having a wider range of freedom to choose our preferred look was a boon.\nThough on the design point, we did find that wearing these glasses for a full day was uncomfortable \u2013 an issue we didn\u2019t have with the Ray-Ban Meta collaboration spectacles \u2013 so it wasn\u2019t a complete win. They also struggled in the audio department, so unless you\u2019re a ChatGPT superfan Meta\u2019s AI wearable above will almost certainly serve you better.\nThe best smart home glasses\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRounding off our AI-equipped smart specs are the Amazon Echo Frames, which as you\u2019d expect offer hands-free access to the Alexa assistant.\nThis feature is useful if your home is packed with Alexa-compatible smart home tech as not only can you control it with your smart speakers, you can manage it using your smart glasses, which is kinda neat. You can also use Alexa for other useful features like jumping into music or podcasts on your connected phone and finding answers to questions (though it\u2019s not as in-depth as a generative AI).\nUnfortunately, beyond the Alexa integration, there\u2019s not a lot to write home about when it comes to these smart glasses.\nTheir audio focus is let down by a generally poor bass response, sound leakage, and overall not standing up to earbuds. Plus without cameras, they lack the content creation angle that people have enjoyed from rivals like the smart Ray-Bans above. Design-wise they are stylish and comfortable, though they lack a charging case \u2013 and we weren\u2019t fans of their charging dock.\nSo much like the Lucyd specs, unless you\u2019re heavily tied into the Alexa ecosystem we\u2019d recommend the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses if you\u2019re after artificial intelligence-powered glasses.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nHamish is a Senior Staff Writer for TechRadar and you\u2019ll see his name appearing on articles across nearly every topic on the site from smart home deals to speaker reviews to graphics card news and everything in between. He uses his broad range of knowledge to help explain the latest gadgets and if they\u2019re a must-buy or a fad fueled by hype. Though his specialty is writing about everything going on in the world of virtual reality and augmented reality."

It starts from mundane tasks like setting up computers and keeping their operating systems updated to complex ones like managing devices remotely and configuring the internal network according to custom specifications. The tasks can be too overwhelming for staff, which is why many companies now employ IT automation tools to make things easier.\nIT automation deals with systems that handle repeatable and mundane technical tasks. Automation platforms perform the simple work that humans would have otherwise spent much time doing over and over again.\nThere are a lot of IT automation systems out there, with each having different specialties. It can be challenging to pick the best ones, but that\u2019s why we\u2019re here. We tested different IT automation platforms to identify the best ones. We narrowed our list based on important factors including pricing, ease of use, customer support, features, etc. After reading this review, it should be easy to make a good choice.\nReader offer: Get a 14-day free trial on NinjaOne\nNinjaOne is a cloud-based IT management platform designed for IT professionals. It offers features like remote monitoring, patch management, asset tracking, and automated remediation, enabling efficient device management across various environments. With capabilities such as secure remote access, real-time alerts, and mobile device management, NinjaOne streamlines IT operations.\nWe've also featured the Best IT asset management tools.\nThe best IT Automation software of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest IT Automation software for IT service management (ITSM)\n1. SysAid\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSysAid is a platform designed to automate IT service management tasks. It utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to help enterprises automate their IT tasks and free up time they can use elsewhere.\nFor instance, SysAid offers ticket automation; it can automatically prioritize your IT tickets and send them to the right personnel that'll take care of the problem. It prioritizes tickets according to your pre-programmed instructions and what the AI system learns from studying your usage.\nYou can also automate repetitive IT tasks, e.g., resetting printers, granting access to software, and transferring files. You can use this platform to automatically onboard new employees and get them familiar with your IT setup. You\u2019ll get a full audit trail of the automated actions that you can review for compliance and security purposes.\nSysAid doesn\u2019t have standard pricing. Your bill depends on the features you want and your custom IT infrastructure, so you\u2019ll have to contact the company\u2019s sales team for a quote. There\u2019s no free plan but there\u2019s a free trial period to test the features before making your final purchase decision.\nBest IT Automation software for endpoint management\n2. NinjaOne\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNinjaOne is popular remote monitoring and IT management platform. It\u2019s very good for automating endpoint management, which refers to managing and supervising devices connected to a network.\nThis platform lets you write automation scripts to handle a lot of behind-the-scenes IT tasks. For example, you can write scripts to automatically back up files at specific times for each connected computer or a script to automatically update antivirus software when required. If you\u2019re not good at programming, you can use the drag-and-drop interface to create automations.\nNinjaOne's scripting engine works in various programming languages, including Javascript, ShellScript, Powershell, etc., and you can automate almost anything on a macOS or Windows operating system. You can control what devices to deploy the automation on. For instance, you can run automation for individual devices or for entire organizations and dynamic groups.\nNinjaOne is more than just endpoint management software. It offers broad IT service management features for enterprises. The drawback is that there\u2019s a steep learning curve if you want to utilize most of the platform\u2019s features.\nBest IT Automation software for robotic process\n3. UiPath\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUiPath is the world\u2019s most popular robotic process automation (RPA) tool, enabling enterprises to automate many IT tasks and free up time and effort to put them to use elsewhere.\nUiPath offers broad automation features. You can build and deploy different types of robots. The platform even comes with ready-made robots designed for various use cases, e.g., healthcare, finance, manufacturing, etc. A good example is using robots to process invoices and vendor payments and generate accounting reports.\nA good thing about UiPath is that you don\u2019t need deep coding experience to create robots on the platform. It offers a drag-and-drop interface to create robots by simply moving modules from one place to another. Your coding expertise still helps to create advanced robots, but it\u2019s not necessary, unlike with many rival RPA platforms.\nUiPath offers excellent customer support. You can contact a human support representative whenever you want and you also have access to a large collection of user guides, manuals, and video tutorials concerning all aspects of the platform. The drawback is that UiPath is pretty expensive, starting at $420 monthly.\nBest IT Automation software for large businesses\n4. Atera\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAtera is a remote monitoring and management software. It enables IT teams to stay on top of their technical infrastructure and ensure that things are always in good shape.\nThis platform incorporates artificial intelligence to help IT personnel automate a lot of tasks. The AI system can analyze common ticket requests and craft intelligent responses (though not always accurate). This feature helps you cut down on your ticket response and management time. AI can answer simple inquiries while your IT staff focuses on the more complex ones. The AI system can even tag and prioritize tickets for the IT staff to handle.\nYou can generate automation scripts using Atera's AI system. The platform comes with over 1,000 ready-made scripts but you can generate additional ones. Atera gives you deep visibility into all devices connected to your network, and you can automate software updates and patches.\nThis tool is very user-friendly, with an intuitive interface that\u2019s easy to understand and navigate. It also has mobile apps, which makes it convenient to use on the go.\nBest IT Automation software for Azure users\n5. Microsoft System Center\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCloud computing is a major part of IT operations nowadays. Many enterprises are migrating from on-premise IT infrastructure to the cloud, and Microsoft Azure is one of the main cloud computing providers they choose.\nMicrosoft's System Center makes it easy to control and manage your IT infrastructure. You can manage all your Azure infrastructure from one place and automate a lot of tasks. For example, you can automatically monitor and troubleshoot your servers at specific periods to detect any issues before they morph into something more serious. You can allocate virtual machines depending on demand instead of renting unnecessary server space with hopes of future demand.\nMicrosoft doesn\u2019t offer a free plan for System Center, which is a disadvantage. Pricing can also run up to thousands of dollars annually, which makes it suitable for large organizations with significant IT budgets.\nA good thing about System Center is that it also enables you to manage on-premise IT infrastructure (servers and PCs) and not just cloud-based ones only.\nBest IT automation tool FAQs\nHow to choose an IT automation platform\nCost\nCost is the first thing to consider when choosing any software. You need to choose something that you can afford in the long term. Pricing for automation tools usually depends on the number of tasks and how big your IT infrastructure is, so it should be easy to estimate how much you\u2019ll pay beforehand. Always read the fine print to see if there are any hidden costs and check if there\u2019s a free trial to test the features before making your final decision.\nEase of use\nYour automation platform should be easy to use and navigate. It should have an intuitive interface that a layman can understand. Complex interfaces can frustrate users and cause costly mistakes.\nCustomer support\nThings can go wrong at any time, and you\u2019ll need external help to solve your issues. Ensure you choose an IT automation platform with a solid reputation regarding customer service; check user reviews to confirm this. You should be able to contact a human support representative via email, telephone, or live chat when you need one. You should also have access to additional support resources such as user guides and video tutorials.\nEssential features of an IT automation tool\n1. Robotic Process Automation (RPA)\nRobotic process automation (RPA) entails building and deploying software robots to handle repetitive tasks. For example, you can build bots to scrape websites and extract contact information or create bots to process employee payroll based on the number of hours worked.\nYour IT automation platform should let you build RPA bots, preferably with a drag-and-drop interface.\n2. Incident management\nYou should be able to manage technical incidents with ease. Your tool should give automatic alerts whenever it detects an IT incident and contact the personnel assigned to that issue beforehand. This feature takes away a lot of stress during the inevitable IT incident.\n3. Endpoint management\nThe tool should enable IT staff to manage multiple devices connected to the enterprise network and automate many tasks. For example, you should be able to install software automatically on all connected devices. It could be a new software recommended by management or an update to an already installed software. You can also automatically check for viruses and security bugs and deploy fixes immediately.\nEndpoint management automation makes IT management much easier for everyone, especially in large organizations.\nHow we tested the best IT automation tools\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors.

      "text": "I am a robotic expert and here are 5 things you should do about autonomous mobile robots\nAMRs fill labor gaps, boost speed, cut costs\nWarehouse efficiency is crucial in helping get goods into the arms of customers. In its simplest form, this means picking, packing and shipping goods from the warehouse to the home as quickly, efficiently and cheaply as possible. In practice, however, there are several challenges that organizations face in their battle to continuously meet customer demand.\nCosts for warehouse operators continue to balloon, amidst rising wages, increased national insurance contributions and increased operational costs. Data from the UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics showed that in Q1 2025, costs rose more steeply for transport and storage companies (including logistics, parcels, haulage and warehousing) than for other comparable sectors. This pressure is being compounded by a huge labor shortage, with skilled employees continuing to leave the industry year on year, and the pipeline of emerging talent continuing to decrease.\nBusinesses are seeking new alternatives to help solve some of these critical industry challenges \u2013 including the introduction of automation, and more specifically, autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). These robots can help complete labor-intensive manual tasks, from intricate picking and sorting of goods to moving pallets and large payloads \u2013 creating huge efficiencies. Here are five key benefits and considerations for companies looking to AMRs to drive efficiency.\nSenior Vice President of Global Robotics at Infios.\n1. AMRs to solve labor challenges\nWarehouses are facing several compounding labor-related pressures simultaneously. An aging workforce means more and more talent leaves the industry each year, while the younger generations are seemingly less likely to consider a role in logistics \u2013 owing to a preference for more \u2018prestigious\u2019 jobs. For existing warehouse employees, retention and workplace engagement is low, contributing to significantly higher turnover rates than in other sectors. These labour disruptions contribute to the slower fulfilment of orders, reduced margins and ultimately impact supply chain resilience.\nRather than taking or replacing jobs, AMRs are actively filling much needed gaps in the labor force, in a way that enhances safety and increases job satisfaction. Using complementary strengths of robots and human workers enhances overall productivity. AMRs excel at repetitive, physically demanding and precision tasks, such as moving heavy loads, sorting items and transporting goods across the warehouse. This allows human workers to focus on higher-value tasks, involving problem solving, critical thinking and adaptability. The result is an efficient workflow, in which the bulk of more dangerous manual labor is handled through automation, while humans oversee quality control, ensuring orders are fulfilled quicker and with less errors.\n2. Meeting demands through reduced order cycles\nToday\u2019s shoppers prioritize convenience and experience. There is an expectation for quick and efficient delivery of items purchased online, and next-day - or increasingly same-day - deliveries are becoming the industry standard. Failure to meet these expectations risks impacting customer loyalty and retention. In fact, as may as one in three customers won\u2019t purchase from a brand they like again, if they have a single negative experience. Improving the order cycle of goods \u2013 from order receipt, through to picking, packing, sorting and shipping \u2013 is critical to meeting these expectations.\nClose integration between AMRs and Warehouse Management (WMS) ensures accurate, real-time data on current inventory, preventing delays and stockouts. By bringing goods directly to workers on the warehouse floor, AMRs minimize walking and travel time. Equally, advanced navigation systems ensure efficient routing and continuous operations. The result is a quantifiable improvement in picking rates, shorter lead times and increased throughput.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\n3. Providing increased flexibility and scalability\nAMRs provide the additional benefit of flexibility and scalability. Season peaks, like Christmas, require significantly more resources to manage an increased order volume. This often requires larger recruitment drives, from an already dwindling talent pool, and longer hours to meet fulfilment deadlines.\nWithout time consuming training processes, AMRs can meet the increased volume of work with minimal ramp-up time needed. As business demands change, AMRs can be scaled up and down to match a live workload and seasonal peaks, while human workers can focus on making reactive changes to overarching business challenges. If demand is massively increased, businesses can add more AMRs to their fleet and integrate these without major infrastructure changes or downtime.\n4. Increasing efficiency through orchestration\nWhile the benefits are clear, deploying AMRs alone isn\u2019t enough to unlock their full potential. Without integration, the efficiency of AMRs can be limited, if they fail to coordinate and complement the workloads of other automated systems, alongside human employees. The future of teamwork within warehouses is through multi-robot and people orchestration \u2013 or technologies that help to coordinate robot fleets and the surrounding manual workers all under one system.\nDriving maximum efficiency while using AMRs requires integration, and the application of real-time data from other key warehouse technologies. For example, orchestrators, who can use live order and inventory information from WMSs can allocate tasks to the most suitable robots, or humans, based on proximity, availability and current workload. This ensures that each robot is always working on the most optimal task possible. Resulting reductions in idle time and bottlenecks, through the intelligent application of resources, minimizes errors and ultimately drives improved efficiency and throughput across the warehouse.\n5. Future-proof your operation\nEnsuring supply chain resilience, and the ability to maintain consistent fulfilment, requires the embracement of technology to drive efficiency. The introduction of AMRs should be part of a wider long-term supply chain and warehouse strategy to balance the strengths of human workers, the efficiency gains for technology and intelligent decision making through real-time data. Together this will enable faster and more accurate delivery of goods, while collectively strengthening the supply chain\u2019s ability to withstand and recover from unexpected challenges.\nUltimately, rising costs and labor shortages are making warehouse efficiency increasingly difficult. Rising adoption of AMRs helps fill labor gaps, speed up order fulfilment and provides valuable flexibility during peak periods. When integrated with warehouse systems and human workers, they optimize workflows and reduce errors overall. Embracing AMRs should be part of a broader technology strategy to provide faster deliveries, meet customer expectations and ultimately build a more resilient supply chain.\nWe featured the best business intelligence platform.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "5 ways manufacturers can embark on their AI journey\nManufacturers can embrace real, practical applications of AI\nAI is no longer just a buzzword. The manufacturing industry has reached a stage where both the technology and the mindset exist to embrace real, practical applications of AI and create tangible value on the factory floor.\nFor many manufacturers, that journey doesn\u2019t require starting from scratch. In fact, it can start with the data humming quietly inside the ERP software you already trust every day.\nBy turning that wealth of real-time production, inventory, and supplier data into fast, predictive insight, manufacturers can cut waste, dodge disruptions, and outpace competitors \u2013 all without ripping out existing systems.\nIn other words, the path to an AI-powered factory floor begins not with wholesale reinvention, but with smarter use of what\u2019s already at your fingertips.\nWith that in mind, here are five practical ways manufacturers can start unlocking that value, without needing to reinvent the wheel.\nRegional Vice President UK&I, Epicor.\n1. Tap into real-time data for faster, smarter decisions\nERP systems hold a wealth of real-time operational data. AI can analyze this information quickly, helping manufacturers optimize daily processes like procurement, inventory planning, and customer service.\nTo make the most of this data, manufacturers don\u2019t need to start from scratch. With AI tools like dashboards, real-time alerts, and insights built right into existing systems, it\u2019s easier to spot trends, track performance, and act on changes as they happen. Instead of digging through reports or jumping between platforms, teams get the information they need right when they need it, helping them make smarter, faster decisions with more confidence.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nFor example, with embedded tools in place, AI can forecast demand patterns and suggest order schedules, helping avoid stockouts or excess inventory that ties up cash. It can also consolidate customer data across touchpoints, providing clearer insights into behavior and preferences, supporting better service and more targeted communications.\nWhen used well, AI turns existing data into a powerful decision-making engine.\n2. Make small tech enhancements that deliver big gains\nRather than undertaking a full system overhaul to benefit from AI, many manufacturers have turned to optimization and focusing on enhancing the tools they already have in place, through the form of \u201cmicro innovations.\u201d\nBy making small, targeted upgrades to existing systems, manufacturers can deliver measurable improvements in efficiency and performance without disrupting day-to-day operations. On the factory floor, we\u2019re seeing smart tech guide workers through complex tasks, improve workforce scheduling, and streamline everything from planning and forecasting to last-mile delivery.\nThese \u201cmicro-innovations\u201d are easier to roll out and less risky than large-scale digital transformation, making them a practical choice in today\u2019s cautious investment climate. And by improving what\u2019s already in place, manufacturers can unlock more value with minimal disruption and less cost.\n3. Free up teams by automating manual tasks\nAI\u2019s real strength lies in removing the repetitive jobs that eat up time and limit productivity. From processing supplier quotes to managing documents, many of these tasks can now be handled by AI tools, freeing up staff to focus on higher-value work.\nFor example, instead of manually sorting through customer records or tracking down compliance paperwork, AI can surface the right information instantly. This not only saves time but reduces the risk of errors. It also improves employee experience, as teams spend less time on admin and more time doing work that adds real value.\nManufacturers can take advantage of these efficiencies by applying AI to the systems they already use every day. Rather than building something new, it\u2019s about enhancing what\u2019s already in place. That way, IT automation becomes a practical, accessible step in the broader AI journey, not a major leap.\n4. Focus on clear, practical use cases\nThe most effective AI projects start with a clear problem to solve. Whether it\u2019s improving customer service, reducing waste, or managing risk in the supply chain, the best results come from targeted, purpose-driven use cases.\nManufacturers can start by looking at the everyday problems that slow things down, like repetitive tasks, frequent errors, or processes that take too long or cost too much. Once those pain points are clear, it\u2019s easier to work backwards and see where AI could help. It\u2019s also worth speaking to the people on the ground \u2014 they usually know exactly where things get stuck and where small improvements could make a big difference.\nFor instance, one practical use case is demand forecasting \u2014 analysing historical trends, seasonal shifts, and supplier timelines to ensure the right stock is in the right place at the right time. Another is improving visibility by merging data across departments to build a clearer, shared picture of operations.\nStarting small and staying focused is the best way for manufacturers to prove value quickly and build momentum for wider AI adoption.\n5. Build confidence with governance and control\nAI is a powerful tool, but it must be implemented responsibly. Manufacturers operate in complex, often highly regulated environments, and any AI system must align with strict data access, compliance, and security standards.\nThat means AI tools should respect user permissions and keep data contained within trusted environments. Just as importantly, outputs need to be monitored and validated, ensuring humans stay in the loop, particularly when decisions carry operational or financial risk.\nStrong governance builds trust. And when teams trust the technology, they\u2019re more likely to use it \u2014 and use it well.\nThe future starts with what you already have\nMany manufacturers already have what they need to start unlocking the benefits of AI \u2014 a lot of the tools, data, and systems are often already in place. The key is taking that first step.\nBy focusing on small, high-impact opportunities and making better use of the data already at their fingertips, AI becomes less of a leap and more of a natural next move.\nYou don\u2019t need a big bang strategy. Just the right tools, clear priorities, and a willingness to start.\nWe list the best business plan software.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best productivity tool of 2025\nHave teams work better\nWe list the best productivity tools, to make it simple and easy to have your teams work more effectively and efficiently.\nProductivity tools do this not just by focusing on simplifying routine tasks, but also by making collaboration and project management much easier for teams. This is especially useful so that no matter where any individual is, they can remain in contact with the rest of their team and provide the latest updates and information that everyone needs.\nProductivity tools also include essential management features, to prioritize schedules and work to deadlines, such as for time management and task management. The also interface needs to be simple and easy to use so that managers do not become bogged down in administrating it all. Additionally, everything needs to be presented in a clear way so that contact management information is easy to find and action.\nThere are also other tools that can help improve productivity and efficiency, simply by making complex tasks simpler and easier to do. This could be anything from managing backups to social media monitoring, or the best CRM software.\nBelow we list what we think are the best productivity apps currently available.\nYour Complete Productivity Suite. Email, Docs, Meetings, and AI in One Place. Upgrade to Google Workspace and save 15% on Starter, Standard and Plus for 12 months (Flex & Commit).\nWe\u2019ve also highlighted the best business productivity gadgets.\nThe best productivity tool of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest productivity tool overall\nReasons to buy\nMicrosoft Office is probably the platform most people think of first when it comes to office productivity suites, with the cloud-based Microsoft 365 being the latest incarnation.\nWhat ensured that MS Office became a market leader is the comprehensive way data can be covered by different applications and moved between them, making working more efficient and hassle-free. With Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Outlook forming the core programs, these cover everything from documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and emails - in effect covering most essential office needs. In addition to that, OneDrive offers online saving and backups to keep your files safe.\nWhile there are alternatives to MS Office, most rivals attempt to play catch-up with Microsoft rather than provide innovative new features, and MS Office still remains the office suite with the most comprehensive range of features. And even if you do use one of these alternatives, the chances are you are going to be working with document formats created specifically for MS Office, and handle data from customers and suppliers who are using the MS Office platform.\nWhile MS Office does have its critics, the bottom line is that nobody does office productivity better than Microsoft, and the core applications in Office have yet to be bettered.\nThe yearly Personal plan costs around $70 / \u00a365 / AU$105 and includes up to 1 TB of cloud storage per user for up to 5 devices.\nRead our full Microsoft 365 review.\nBest productivity tool for collaboration\nReasons to buy\nAsana has been around since 2008, making it a veteran in the collaboration arena, and companies such as Intel, Uber, Pinterest and TED all use it as their core method of communication.\nIt\u2019s been designed as an easy way for companies to track the work of employees and to get the best possible results. Using the platform, you can create to-do lists for ongoing projects, set reminders for upcoming deadlines and send requests to colleagues. Team members can also assign comments to posts within the app.\nYou can organize all your projects in a list or board format, and there\u2019s a search function so you can locate past work quickly. In short, Asana is a very effective way to stay super-organized and facilitate conversations when it comes to updates on how work is progressing.\nThere are three paid tiers: Premium (priced at around $9 / \u00a310 / AU$15 per user per month when billed annually), Business (costing around $20 / \u00a321 / AU$30 per user per month on a yearly basis) and Enterprise. Premium tracks team projects and includes many extra features such as advanced searches, a workflow builder and custom fields. The Business plan offers everything in Premium plus added resources such as portfolios, advanced reporting and time tracking.\nRead our full Asana review.\nBest productivity tool for versatility\nReasons to buy\nTrello is a smartly designed and popular service for managing, organizing and sharing everything from simple to-dos to major project management tasks.\nGetting started is as easy as dragging cards onto a Trello board. Cards can represent single tasks, with priorities and deadlines attached. But they can also be more substantial checklists, with attached files and pictures, containing hyperlinks to point somewhere else.\nAnd there's a whole library of Power-Ups, custom cards which allow you to integrate a host of third-party services into your workflow: Box, Evernote, GIPHY, GitHub, Hangouts, Join.me, Mailchimp, OneDrive, Salesforce, Slack, SmartDraw, SurveyMonkey, Twitter, ZenDesk and more.\nTrello has plenty of collaboration tools to help you manage your projects, and a stack of ingenious features to ensure it's user-friendly. Just one example: the Cloud Aging power-up visibly ages cards if they've not been accessed for a while, fading them out, maybe turning them yellow and even cracking. This isn't just a visual gimmick \u2013 it allows users to instantly see underused cards on even the busiest of boards, a real timesaver.\nRead our full Trello review.\nBest productivity tool for features\nReasons to buy\nBitrix24 provides a vast suite of powerful business tools: collaboration, instant messaging, telephony, project management, document handling, scheduling, employee management, and more.\nIf you prefer to keep things simple then you can concentrate on the excellent CRM, which is a capable system all on its own. Contacts and communications are logged, leads assigned to sales managers, emails sent, calls recorded, quotes and invoices issued. Detailed reports keep you up-to-date and there's convenient access via the mobile app.\nBitrix24's unusually generous free account supports 12 users and includes 5GB storage, but if you need more, the Plus account offers more features.\nOverall, Bitrix24 is offers a powerful suite of tools that is especially going to be handy for small businesses and start-ups to help them develop and grow through improved productivity, all in one platform.\nRead our full Bitrix24 review.\nBest free productivity app\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTodoist straddles the categories of time management tools and to-do lists, with an element of project management thrown in for good measure. Despite touching on multiple genres, the tool remains easy to use, making it possible to manage multiple project with ease, and see at a glance what you still have to do.\nThe website or app gives you a daily and weekly overview of what work you have to do, what appointment you have, or whatever else you choose to track. If you're working with a group of people and find that your workload is getting a little heavy, you can delegate tasks to others.\nThe free version limits you to working with five people and having 80 active projects on the go at any one time, and this should be more than enough for most people, but Premium and Business plans are available for a fee. Todoist offers integration with dozens of apps and services so it can tie in neatly to your existing workflow.\nRead our full Todoist review.\n2. RescueTime\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRescueTime not only tracks the time you spend doing different things on your computer or mobile \u2013 such as visiting particular websites or using specific apps \u2013 it does so automatically. Running in the background as it does, RescueTime quietly logs your activity without serving as a distraction.\nIt's possible to set yourself targets and alerts, and the idea is that these goals will help you to develop better working habits. It enables you to see just how you spend your day on your digital devices so you can better understand where the time has gone. There free version of the app enables you to look back at three months of data for analysis, but paid-for packages (which start at $6 per month) have no limits and includes a number of extra features.\nFor most people, the free version will be more than enough, and the fact that it is available for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android and ChromeOS means that it is possible to track work across multiple devices and platforms.\n3. Beeminder\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBeeminder is quite a unique tool that can be used to track and monitor everything from running or trips to the gym, to logging how often you write, or managing a to-do list. Available as an app, or usable online, Beeminder is endlessly flexible \u2013 you define your goal (whatever that may be) and you are tasked with logging your progress. There is a degree of gamification to things here; you're aiming to stick to the 'yellow brick road', which means that, at least on average, you are hitting your targets.\nAnything that can be plotted on a graph can be tracked \u2013 number of words written, number of hours worked, number of contracts signed \u2013 and sticking within the golden zone can be hugely incentivizing. If you're willing to commit fully, you can add your credit card details to your account so you can be fined for failing to stay on track. Beeminder is not for everyone one, but it is so unique, it is well worth giving it a try to see if it works for you.\n4. Toggl\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nToggl is described by its developers as \u2018insanely simple time tracking\u2019, and that's a pretty fair summary. If you take a look at the website, it is the premium versions of the service that are pushed, but there is a free version suitable for teams of up to five people.\nToggl is available for multiple platforms and synchronization means that you can move between devices and stick track your work. There's a lot to explore here, including manual and automated track of activity, a Pomodoro timer, automatic detection of idle time, reminders, integrations with various apps and services and much, much more.\nThe beauty of Toggl, however, is that it is so flexible and customizable. What ever you're looking to monitor, you can probably bend it to your will. The detailed reports are impressive, but it's a bit of shame to see that there is no invoicing option in an otherwise feature-packed tool.\n5. Clockify\nReasons to buy\nClockify grabs the idea of clocking on and off for a shift and runs with it. It is a very simple tool, but that's precisely what will make it so appealing to people \u2013 after all, if you're busy with work, you don't to be overwhelmed with a complex tool for tracking what you're doing!\nClockify is essentially a basic stopwatch so you can easily record how long you spend working on different project. Just start the timers, and you can add labels, descriptions and project details, and just hit stop when you're done. You can configure timers to start as soon as you open your browser so you don't need to remember to do so.\nClockify integrates with Trello, Asana, Jira, Todoist and more, and you can use the website and apps to view details reports and breakdown of how you have spent your time. If you would like to keep Clockify available at all times without the need to dedicate a browser tab to it, you'll be pleased to hear that there is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that keep it just a click away. There are also mobile apps, and desktop versions for macOS, Windows and Linux.\nBest productivity tool FAQs\nWhich productivity tool is best for you?\nWhen deciding which productivity tool to download and use, first consider what your actual needs are, as sometimes free platforms may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a paid platform is much more worthwhile.
