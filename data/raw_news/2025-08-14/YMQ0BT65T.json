  "content": "The Supreme Court has decided not to weigh in on one of the many state-level age-verification laws currently being reviewed across the country. Today, the top court chose not to intervene on legislation from Mississippi about checking the ages of social media users, an application to vacate stay from NetChoice.\n\nThe Mississippi law requires all users to verify their ages in order to use social media sites. It also places responsibility on the social networks to prevent children from accessing \"harmful materials\" and it requires parental consent for minors to use any social media. NetChoice represents several tech companies \u2014 including social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube \u2014 and it sued to block the law on grounds that it violates the First Amendment. A district court ruled in favor of NetChoice, but the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals lifted its temporary block.\n\nAlthough Justice Brett Kavanaugh denied the application to vacate stay on the appeals court ruling, he also wrote that \"NetChoice has, in my view, demonstrated that it is likely to succeed on the merits\u2014namely, that enforcement of the Mississippi law would likely violate its members' First Amendment rights under this Court\u2019s precedents.\" He denied the application because NetChoice \"has not sufficiently demonstrated that the balance of harms and equities favors it at this time.\" This decision means that, at least for now, Mississippi's law will be allowed to stand.\n\n\"Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence makes clear that NetChoice will ultimately succeed in defending the First Amendment,\" said Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center. \"This is merely an unfortunate procedural delay.\"\n\nThere are several other state laws being assessed at various points in the US legal system. Some are centered on adult content providers such as , while others are more broadly targeting social media use. and have seen federal judges block their laws, while and are working toward adopting their own rules about social media for minors.\n\nYahoo, the parent company of Engadget, is a member of NetChoice.",

      "text": "Supreme Court sides with Texas' age verification law for porn sites\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Friday upheld a Texas law requiring consumers to provide age verification in order to gain access to commercial websites that provide sexually explicit material. It was the first time that the court has imposed requirements on adult consumers in order to protect minors from having such access.\nFree-speech advocates argued that while the law's goal is to limit minors' access to online sexually explicit content, it is overly vague and imposes significant burdens on adults' access to constitutionally protected expression. Lawyers for Texas said in their filing, and during arguments, that the law's opponents had failed to show a single person whose rights have been \"chilled\" by it.\nBy a vote of 6-3 along ideological lines, the court agreed with Texas, saying the law \"only incidentally burdens the protected speech of adults.\"\nThe Texas measure, enacted in 2023, was aimed at protecting kids under the age of 18 from exposure to sexually explicit material.\nIt did that by requiring every user, including adults, to first provide proof, typically via a government-issued identification, that they were at least 18 years old. The statute applies to all websites that contain content that is one-third or more \"sexually suggestive\" in nature and \"harmful to children.\"\nMore Supreme Court decisions from today:\n- Supreme Court limits nationwide injunctions in birthright citizenship order\n- SCOTUS: Parents can opt kids out of classes with LGBTQ book characters\n- Supreme Court upholds key Obamacare measure on preventive care\n- Supreme Court postpones Louisiana redistricting case to next term\n- Supreme Court upholds program providing internet access to rural Americans\nJust what the term \"harmful to children\" means is debatable because, according to the measure, the term could cover any sexually suggestive material, including romance novels and R-rated movies.\nThe Free Speech Coalition, an adult industry trade association, and several adult industry producers challenged the law in court, contending that it violated the First Amendment guarantee to free speech and expression.\nThe groups noted, among other things, that while the statute does bar companies from retaining the identifying information, it does not prohibit transfer of that information or impose any other protection from disclosure to protect adults' privacy. Moreover, the challengers maintained the state's defense of the statute fell apart in light of the fact that it exempted from the law's coverage the search engines and social-media platforms that are the principal gateways for minors gaining access to sexually explicit content.\nFederal judge David Alan Ezra, a Reagan appointee, initially barred the law from taking effect, on the grounds that it was likely unconstitutional.\nBut a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals panel voted 2-to-1 to uphold the law, clearing the way for it to take effect."

      "text": "Texas is getting ready to ban social media for anyone under 18\nThe bill still needs to pass a Senate vote and get approval from the governor.\nTexas could become the next US state to lay down the law with social media platforms. A Texas bill that would ban social media use for anyone under 18 recently moved past the Senate committee and is due for a vote in front of the Texas State Senate. The bill has until the state's legislative session comes to an end on June 2, leaving roughly a week for it to be approved by both the Senate and the governor.\nEarlier this year, the bill passed the House committee stage and was later voted in favor of by the state's House of Representatives. If made into law, the bill would force social media platforms to verify the age of anyone setting up an account, much like how Texas passed legislation requiring websites hosting porn to implement an age verification system. On top of that, Texas' social media ban proposes to let parents delete their child's social media account, allowing the platforms 10 days to comply with the request or face a fine from the state's attorney general.\nTexas isn't the only governing body interested in restricting social media access. Last year, Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, signed into law a bill that outright bans anyone under 14 from using social media and requires 14- and 15-year-olds to get parental consent to make an account or use an existing account. Notably, Texas' proposed law is much stricter than that.\nOn a larger scale, the US Senate introduced a bill to ban social media platforms for anyone under 13 in April 2024. After being stuck in the committee stage, Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) recently made comments that signal a potential second attempt at getting this passed."

      "text": "Arkansas social media age verification law blocked by federal Judge\nThe state passed the controversial law in 2023.\nAn Arkansas law requiring social media companies to verify the ages of their users has been struck down by a federal judge who ruled that it was unconstitutional. The decision is a significant victory for the social media companies and digital rights groups that have opposed the law and others like it.\nArkansas became the second state (after Utah) to pass an age verification law for social media in 2023. The Social Media Safety Act required companies to verify the games of users under 18 and get permission from their parents. The law was challenged by NetChoice, a lobbying group representing the tech industry whose membership includes Meta, Snap, X, Reddit and YouTube. NetChoice has also challenged laws restricting social media access in Utah, Texas and California.\nIn a ruling, Judge Timothy Brooks said that the law, known as Act 689, was overly broad. \u201cAct 689 is a content-based restriction on speech, and it is not targeted to address the harms the State has identified,\u201d Brooks wrote in his decision. \u201cArkansas takes a hatchet to adults\u2019 and minors\u2019 protected speech alike though the Constitution demands it use a scalpel.\u201d Brooks also highlighted the \u201cunconstitutionally vague\u201d applicability of the law, which seemingly created obligations for some online services, but may have exempted services which had the \"predominant or exclusive function [of]... direct messaging\" like Snapchat.\n\u201cThe court confirms what we have been arguing from the start: laws restricting access to protected speech violate the First Amendment,\u201d NetChoice\u2019s Chris Marchese said in a statement. \u201cThis ruling protects Americans from having to hand over their IDs or biometric data just to access constitutionally protected speech online.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear if state officials in Arkansas will appeal the ruling. \u201cI respect the court\u2019s decision, and we are evaluating our options,\u201d Arkansas Attorney general Tim Griffin said in a statement.\nEven with NetChoice\u2019s latest victory, it seems that age verification laws are unlikely to go away anytime soon. Utah recently passed an age verification requirement for app stores. And a Texas law requiring porn sites to conduct age verification is currently before the Supreme Court."

      "text": "A new Nebraska law wants to make social media less addictive for kids\nCompanies will have to offer time usage limits, content restrictions and chronological feeds for younger users.\nNebraska is the latest state to crack down on how kids can use social media. The state's governor, Jim Pillen, recently signed into law a package of bills aimed at restricting certain social media features that keep kids hooked on the platform. The final bill signed, called the Age-Appropriate Online Design Code Act, will require companies to offer time limits on usage, restrict certain categories of content and provide chronological feeds instead of algorithmic ones that promote infinite scrolling.\nThe Age-Appropriate Online Design Code Act, also known as LB504, details that social media companies can only collect the minimum amount of personal data from younger users, and offers parents more tools to limit how their children use their accounts. Along with those restrictions, the law prohibits any ads related to gambling, alcohol, tobacco or drugs from reaching kids on social media.\nAlongside LB504, the signed package of bills includes LB140 that limits student use of smartphones in schools, LB383 that requires social media companies to verify the age of its users and require parental consent for creating accounts, and LB172 that creates criminal penalties for AI-generated pornography.\n\"Collectively, all these bills have an incredible impact on helping our teachers and giving our schools the opportunity to teach our kids, instead of being disrupted in the classroom,\" Pillen said in a press release. \"They also provide parents with the tools they need to protect our kids from big tech online companies and predators.\"\nThe law is set to go into effect January 1, 2026, and any companies that violate these new regulations will face civil penalties. Nebraska is the latest state to restrict social media usage for minors, but Texas is also trying to pass a similar ban. With more efforts to regulate social media, NetChoice, an Internet advocacy organization whose members include Google, Meta and X, has voiced criticism of these states' efforts, arguing that they infringe on First Amendment rights and user privacy. In 2022, California signed a similar law meant to protect underage users, but it has since been in a legal battle following a lawsuit filed by NetChoice that claims a violation of free speech rights."

      "text": "Florida's social media law has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge\n'The challenged law is likely unconstitutional,' the court ruled.\nA federal judge has temporarily blocked Florida's new law that bans some children from using social media and requires parental consent for others, according to court documents. Judge Mark Walker ruled in favor of two tech organizations (NetChoice and the CCIA) representing social media organizations like Meta, Snap and X, saying that the state's bill HB3 signed into law in March this year is \"likely unconstitutional.\"\nThe law requires parent or guardian consent for 14- and 15-year-olds to make an account or use a pre-existing account on a social media platform, while children under 14 are banned altogether. Platforms must abide by requests to delete these accounts within five business days and each violation could result in a $10,000 fine. That increases to $50,000 per instance if it is ruled that the company participated in a \u201cknowing or reckless\u201d violation of the law.\n\"Floridians have the right to access lawful speech without the government controlling what they say, share or see online,\u201d said NetChoice Director of Litigation, Chris Marchese.\nThe state of Florida tried to bypass normal first amendment free speech protections by employing the \"narrowly tailored\" rules, saying the law is designed to protect children from five addictive features of social media: push notifications, auto-play videos, live streaming, infinite scrolling and personal metrics. However, the judge ruled that the application is too broad in ways that have been shot down before by the Supreme Court.\n\"As applied to Plaintiffs' members alone, the law likely bans all youth under 14 from holding accounts on, at a minimum, four websites that provide forums for all manner of protected speech: Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat,\" Judge Walker wrote. \"It also bans 14- and 15-year-olds from holding accounts on those four websites absent a parent's affirmative consent, a requirement that the Supreme Court has clearly explained the First Amendment does not countenance.\"\nChildren could also be banned from social media even if the platforms created youth accounts without any of the five addictive features \u2014 as long as they were available for adults. The judge also called out the law's specificities about the ability of a child to access a platform based on how much time all children spend on the app.\nThe ruling does leave one provision in place. Social media companies are still required to \"terminate any account held by a youth under 16 in the state upon the request of a parent or guardian,\" as required by the bill.\nYahoo, the parent company of Engadget, is a member of NetChoice."
