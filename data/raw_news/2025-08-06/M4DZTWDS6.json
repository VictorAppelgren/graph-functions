  "content": "Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has filed a motion to dismiss the $1.76 billion lawsuit from the FTX estate, arguing the U.S. court has no jurisdiction and he was improperly served.\n\nBinance founder Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao has filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit brought by the FTX bankruptcy estate, arguing that a U.S. court has no legal grounds to pursue the case.\n\nFiled on August 5 in Delaware Bankruptcy Court, the motion claims that Zhao, a UAE resident, was \u201cimproperly served\u201d and that the court has no personal jurisdiction over him. \u201cMr. Zhao is not amenable to suit in this forum,\u201d the filing reads. \u201cThe claims are in any event legally unfounded, and many are outright incoherent.\u201d\n\nJoin the discussion with CryptoWendyO on Roundtable here.\n\nThe case centers on a July 2021 equity buyback deal in which FTX repurchased Binance\u2019s 20% stake using a mix of FTT tokens and Binance-branded assets like BUSD. FTX alleges the funds used were misappropriated customer deposits and is now seeking to recover them as part of its bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nZhao\u2019s legal team argues he wasn\u2019t the recipient of any funds. \u201cPlaintiffs in fact show that Mr. Zhao was not a transferee,\u201d the filing states. \u201cThey allege he was merely a nominal counterparty in the transfer of BUSD from Alameda LTD to Binance.\u201d\n\nThis follows similar motions to dismiss filed by other Binance executives in July.\n\nThe FTX estate claims Zhao played a broader role in FTX\u2019s collapse, referencing his 2022 tweet that sparked a wave of customer withdrawals. However, Zhao maintains he had no direct involvement and served only as a \u201cnominal signatory.\u201d\n\nZhao previously served a four-month sentence in the U.S. for violating anti-money laundering laws in a separate case, stepping down as Binance CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. regulators.",
