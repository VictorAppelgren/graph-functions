      "text": "Dean Cain channels Superman as he joins ICE\nBy Ryan General\nActor Dean Cain, best known for playing Superman in the 1990s television series \u201cLois & Clark,\u201d announced this week that he is joining U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in support of President Donald Trump\u2019s renewed push to expand immigration enforcement.\nICE recruitment effort\nCain, 59, made the announcement Wednesday in a video posted to Instagram, saying he wanted to move beyond commentary and take direct action. He urged others to apply for ICE positions, citing federal benefits, student loan repayment and signing bonuses.\n\u201cI felt it was important to join with our first responders to help secure the safety of all Americans, not just talk about it, so I joined up,\u201d Cain said in the video, which featured the Superman theme playing in the background. In an appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cJesse Watters Primetime\u201d later that evening, he described the decision as an act of principle, stating, \u201cI will be sworn in as an ICE agent ASAP.\u201d\nThe announcement came the same day the Department of Homeland Security said it would eliminate age limits for new hires across its immigration enforcement agencies. In a news release, the department said the waiver would allow \u201ceven more patriots [to] qualify to join ICE,\u201d following a major budget increase from Congress aimed at expanding enforcement efforts.\n\u201cTruth, justice and the American way\u201d\nCain, whose Japanese ancestors were among those incarcerated in camps during World War II, said he views joining ICE as a way to contribute directly to public safety and national integrity. ICE, which has resumed large-scale raids and removals, faces scrutiny for enforcement actions that have led to the detention of legal residents and even U.S. citizens. Civil rights groups have raised concerns about due-process violations and aggressive tactics.\nCain\u2019s video echoed the legacy of Superman through both patriotic framing and use of the character\u2019s theme music. In recent remarks, he criticized James Gunn\u2019s Superman, which highlights the character\u2019s immigrant identity. \u201cSuperman has always stood for truth, justice and the American way, and the American way is immigrant-friendly, tremendously immigrant-friendly, but there are rules,\u201d Cain said.\nThis story is part of The Rebel Yellow Newsletter \u2014 a bold weekly newsletter from the creators of NextShark, reclaiming our stories and celebrating Asian American voices.\nSubscribe free to join the movement.

      "text": "ICE detainee found hanging in Moshannon shower room, was awaiting immigration hearing, officials say\nChaofeng Ge, a Chinese national, had been in ICE custody for five days and was awaiting an immigration hearing, officials said.\nAn ICE detainee was found hanging by his neck in a shower room at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center on Tuesday morning and pronounced dead shortly afterward, the agency said late Wednesday night.\nChaofeng Ge, 32, a Chinese national, had been in ICE custody for five days, and was awaiting a hearing before the Executive Office for Immigration Review, ICE said. He was pronounced dead by the Clearfield County coroner at 6:03 a.m.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement said Wednesday night that the cause of Ge\u2019s death was under investigation.\nHe was found in the shower room of his detention pod at 5:21 a.m. Tuesday by staff members, officials said. They immediately lowered him to the ground, began CPR, and contacted Emergency Medical Services, the Pennsylvania State Police, and the coroner\u2019s office, ICE said.\nEven before ICE announced the death, word of a suspected suicide at the giant central Pennsylvania detention center flashed through Philadelphia immigration circles. A coalition of immigrant-advocate groups, united as the Shut Down Detention Campaign, held an online news conference Thursday at which they called for the closure of Moshannon and other centers.\nThey said isolation and difficult conditions, coupled with recent reports of overcrowding and insufficient food, put detainee lives at risk. They shared a 2024 study on the center, conducted by the Social Justice Lawyering Clinic at Temple University, which cited detainee reports on a range of issues, from inability to access medical care to physical and psychological abuse by staff members.\nGe had been arrested on Jan. 23 by Lower Paxton Township police and charged with criminal use of a communication facility, unlawful use of a computer, and access device fraud, ICE said.\nCriminal Use of a Communication Facility is a third-degree felony punishable by up to seven years in prison. It involves using a device to transmit signals, writing, images or sound to bring about the commission of a felony.\nLower Paxton police said they had been dispatched to a Harrisburg CVS drug store for a report of a man using fraudulent credit cards in an attempt to purchase gift cards. There they found Ge, of Flushing, N.Y., with numerous stolen credit card numbers in his cell phone, authorities said.\nGe was arrested, charged, and arraigned the same day. He was taken to the Dauphin County Prison after he was unable to post bail, set at $150,000, according to police.\nThe next day, Jan. 24, the Philadelphia Enforcement and Removal Operations\u2019 York sub-office lodged an immigration detainer with the prison.\nICE detainers are agency-issued requests, usually made to jails and prisons, to hold someone until agents can arrive to make an arrest \u2014 often past the time a person might normally be released.\nOn July 31, Ge pleaded guilty to accessing a device issued to another who did not authorize use, and to conspiracy to commit the same. He was sentenced to six to 12 months for each count and granted immediate release to the ICE detainer, the agency said.\nYork-based ICE officers took Ge into custody, and transported him to the York ICE office for processing. He was later transferred to Moshannon.\nThe processing center is a private immigration prison operated by the Florida-based GEO Group Inc. It\u2019s located near Philipsburg, northwest of State College, Pa., where its 1,876 beds make it by far the largest of four ICE detention centers in Pennsylvania.\nIn June it held an average daily population of 1,320, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which tracks immigration data.\nChristopher Ferreira, director of corporate relations at GEO Group, referred questions about Ge\u2019s death to ICE. The Moshannon facility administrator, Lenny Oddo, did not reply to an email seeking information. Clearfield County Coroner Kim Shaffer-Snyder did not respond to a phone message.\nThe immigration-advocacy groups called on the Clearfield County Commissioners to end the contract between the county, ICE and the GEO Group that enables detentions at Moshannon. The Pennsylvania Immigration Coalition, Detention Watch Network, Juntos, and others took part.\n\u201cThis is a really sad day,\u201d said Adrianna Torres-Garcia, deputy director of the Philadelphia-based Free Migration Project. \u201cOne man died, but many more are locked inside.\u201d\nActivists questioned the rapid expansion of the ICE budget, which they said was central to President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to carry out mass deportations.\nThe Republican-led Congress recently set aside about $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security, including $75 billion in extra funding for ICE.\n\u201cGood people in the community are embarrassed by the facility,\u201d said Indivisible: Mayday cofounder Bobbi Erickson, who lives about 30 miles from Moshannon and called it \u201ca for-profit human-rights violation.\u201d\nICE said it notified the Chinese Embassy of the death.\nThe agency noted that it\u2019s required to make public its reports on an in-custody death within 90 days. Those can be found on the agency Detainee Death Reporting page.\nThose records indicate that 13 people died in custody in fiscal year 2025. The figure was 12 the previous year, and a total of seven died in the combined years of 2023 and 2022, according to ICE.\n\u201cICE remains committed to ensuring that all those in its custody reside in safe, secure, and humane environments,\u201d the agency said in confirming the death at Moshannon. \u201cComprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay. \u2026 At no time during detention is a detained illegal alien denied emergent care.\u201d\nNationally, as of June 27, ICE confined 56,945 immigrants in centers across the country. That\u2019s up from 39,238 whenTrump took office in January, promising to deport millions of people.\nGEO Group provides what it calls turnkey solutions for governments worldwide, offering a spectrum of correctional and community-reentry services.\nIts operations include 97 secure facilities, processing centers, and community reentry centers that encompass about 74,000 beds, including projects currently under development.\n\u201cIt is the mission of the Moshannon Valley Processing Center,\u201d the company says on its website, \u201cto provide the highest level of service to our client; our primary objective being to ensure the safety of the community, staff, and those entrusted into our custody.\u201d\nIn February, GEO Group announced it had been awarded a $1 billion, 15-year contract by ICE to establish a federal detention center at 1,000-bed Delaney Hall in Newark.\nFour months later, Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker called conditions there untenable, citing security lapses, reports of mistreatment of detainees, and complaints of food shortages.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that GEO Group has shown it cannot \u2014 or will not \u2014 operate Delaney Hall humanely or safely,\u201d the senator said.\nThis is a developing story and will be updated."

      "text": "Surge in ICE detention deaths Sparks National Alarm\n- Shan Potts\n- Jul 3\n- 2 min read\nAs of June 30, 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has recorded 13 deaths in custody during the current fiscal year\u2014already surpassing last year\u2019s total of 12. Cases include a 75-year-old Cuban man, a 49-year-old Canadian, and at least two apparent suicides. With facilities operating at 140% capacity and over 56,000 people detained, experts fear this could become the deadliest year on record for ICE custody\nWhat is Causing These ICE Detention Deaths?\nOvercrowding, underfunded medical services, and poor oversight are fueling a humanitarian crisis. ICE is detaining around 3,000 individuals daily\u2014a target set by current policies\u2014and relying heavily on private prison and transport companies with limited accountability.\nExperts describe the system as a \u201cticking time bomb,\u201d citing a recent death in transit and other deteriorations in care standards. Advocacy groups say the tragedies stem from systematic neglect rather than isolated incidents.\nWhat It Means for Immigrants\nThe rise in ICE detention deaths has serious implications for immigrants across the country. With enforcement efforts intensifying, more people are being funneled into a detention system already overwhelmed by overcrowding, poor medical care, and lack of accountability. These conditions create a dangerous environment where serious health risks, neglect, and even death are becoming alarmingly common.\nAnyone caught in this system\u2014regardless of their background\u2014faces the same dangers. A missed court date, a paperwork error, or even being in the wrong place at the wrong time can result in detention under unsafe conditions. The growing number of ICE detention deaths serves as a stark warning about the urgent need for reform and vigilance.\nShan Potts Law Offices Perspective\nAt Shan Potts Law Offices, the surge in ICE detention deaths is viewed as a red flag of systemic breakdown. These are not merely statistics\u2014they represent preventable tragedies exacerbated by aggressive policies and neglectful operations.\nWe advise clients to:\nDocument and promptly address any health conditions.\nSeek immediate representation if detained.\nWork with attorneys and advocacy groups to ensure proper conditions and oversight.\nShan Potts stands ready to challenge unjust detentions and fight for humane treatment of all individuals, citizen or immigrant.\nNext Steps\nKnow your rights: Anyone detained should immediately request legal counsel and medical assistance.\nDocument conditions: Collect detailed records of detention conditions, medical neglect, or suspicious circumstances.\nEngage advocates: Contact organizations focused on ICE oversight and detainee welfare.\nPush for transparency: Demand accountability through Freedom of Information Act requests and Congressional inquiries into ICE detention deaths.\nMonitor legal developments: More lawsuits and investigations are expected as families pursue justice.\nWhile the deaths in ICE detention camps continue to climb, visibility and advocacy can help pressure the system toward reform and protection of detainees."

The shift follows rising concerns over tariffs, economic instability, and immigration enforcement. Meanwhile, Trump unveiled new trade deals with Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia ahead of his tariff deadline, and federal authorities are investigating the second death of a Vietnamese man in ICE custody this year.\nTrump\u2019s favorability among Asian Americans plummets\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s favorability rating among Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander adults has dropped sharply since late 2024, according to a new AAPI Data and AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.\nThe survey, conducted June 3 to June 11, interviewed 1,130 AAPI adults in English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese and Korean. The poll found that 71% of AAPI adults now view Trump unfavorably, up from 60% in December 2024.\nEconomic anxieties\nAbout 80% of AAPI adults expect Trump\u2019s tariff policies to increase consumer prices and fewer than 40% believe tariffs will benefit U.S. manufacturing. Only 25% expect more jobs as a result, while nearly half of those polled actually anticipate job losses.\nTwo thirds of respondents said they are extremely or very concerned about a possible recession, compared to 53% of adults nationally. A majority of AAPI adults also disapprove of Trump\u2019s policy priorities, with 55% saying he is focusing on the wrong issues and most criticizing his handling of the economy, trade negotiations and government spending.\nImmigration enforcement\nMost respondents oppose eliminating agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education, and a majority support continued investment in health care, education and economic stability. Previous polling by AAPI Data and AP-NORC in late 2024 showed nearly as many AAPI adults opposed mass deportation proposals as supported stricter enforcement.\nA recent CBS News/YouGov poll found a majority of Americans now oppose Trump\u2019s mass deportation plan, with 54% describing it as too aggressive and most saying it would affect mostly nonviolent individuals.\nPolitical outlook\nIndependent voters within the AAPI community have shown the sharpest decline in support for Trump, with nearly 70% now holding an unfavorable view, a jump of about 20 percentage points since December. This figure is significantly higher than the 52% unfavorable rating among all independents nationwide. The drop in Trump\u2019s favorability comes as attitudes toward government priorities and immigration continue to shift ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\nTrump unveils major Asia trade deals as deadline approaches\nPresident Donald Trump announced new trade agreements with Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia this week as the Trump-imposed August 1 tariff deadline approaches.\nJapan\nThe U.S.\u2013Japan agreement reduces planned tariffs on Japanese exports from 25% to 15% in exchange for a $550 billion Japanese investment in U.S. infrastructure and expanded market access for American vehicles and farm products. While Japanese financial markets rallied following the announcement, reaction from political and business leaders was mixed.\nPrime Minister Shigeru Ishiba described the deal as a turning point, though some leaders in Japan raised concerns about long-term effects on domestic industries. Earlier this month, Trump drew attention by sending a blunt warning letter addressed to \u201cMr. Japan,\u201d threatening 25% tariffs unless a deal was reached by his self-imposed deadline.\nPhilippines, Indonesia\nThe agreement with the Philippines sets a 19% tariff on Philippine exports to the U.S., a modest 1% reduction from Trump\u2019s previous 20% threat. As part of the deal, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. confirmed the Philippines will eliminate tariffs on imported American automobiles, a move expected to open up the domestic auto market to more U.S. brands. Marcos noted that \u201cthere\u2019s still a lot of detail that needs to be worked out,\u201d indicating further negotiation may be needed.\nIndonesia will also face a 19% tariff, reduced from the 32% rate Trump had previously proposed. Indonesia has agreed to eliminate nearly all trade barriers for imports of U.S. goods, a move that government officials say will benefit both countries, while some industry leaders in Indonesia await more specifics.\nRegional context\nThese latest deals follow previously announced tariff changes with Vietnam and several Southeast Asian countries. Vietnam\u2019s exports are set to face a 20% tariff, with double that rate for goods identified as being transshipped from China.\nSoutheast Asian countries such as Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia will see tariffs ranging from 25% to 40% after Trump announced new rounds of \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs earlier this month.\nNegotiations with China are ongoing, while talks with South Korea and the European Union are expected to continue as the August deadlines approach.\nU.S. migration may go negative for the 1st time in over 60 years\nNet migration to the United States may plunge to its lowest level in decades this year, according to a new report from D.C. think tanks American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and the Brookings Institution.\nResearchers estimate that the nation could see anywhere from a net loss of 525,000 people to a modest net gain of 115,000 by the end of 2025. This sharp drop stands in contrast to 2024, when net migration was nearly 1.3 million, and to 2020, when pandemic-related travel restrictions pushed the figure down to 330,000.\nAEI researchers cite \u201ca dramatic decrease in inflows and somewhat higher outflows\u201d as the main drivers behind the decline. The report points to stricter immigration enforcement, reduced visa issuances and a rise in deportations and voluntary departures as significant factors. It also highlights the continued impact of policies introduced under President Donald Trump.\nStan Veuger, a senior fellow at AEI and co-author of the study, said, \u201cThe range we have is about 600,000 people wide, but \u2026 the mid-point estimate is definitely negative,\u201d noting this could be the first net outflow since before 1960.\nThe projected drop in migration is expected to reverberate through the U.S. labor market, with JPMorgan economists suggesting that approximately 150,000 fewer legal workers may enter the country each month by year-end. AEI and Brookings researchers estimate that the reduction in net migration could shave 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points off GDP growth in 2025 while potentially pushing monthly job gains close to zero. While AEI experts note that migration figures could shift if policies change or global conditions improve, the current trajectory points to an unprecedented contraction in net migration.\nSecond Vietnamese man dies in ICE custody this year\nA federal investigation has been launched after Tien Xuan Phan, a 55-year-old Vietnamese national, died while being held at the ICE Processing Center in Karnes County, Texas.\nWhat happened: Phan had been detained for seven weeks after being arrested on June 2 for failing to comply with a 2012 removal order. According to ICE, Phan began experiencing seizures, vomiting and unresponsiveness on July 18. He was first taken to Otto Kaiser Memorial Hospital, then airlifted to Methodist Hospital Northeast in San Antonio, where he died the next day.\nMedical details and review: ICE officials stated that Phan died of natural causes, but the official cause has not been confirmed. Authorities said all required notifications were made to the Department of Homeland Security and other federal oversight agencies. A formal review is ongoing, including an examination of Phan\u2019s medical care and the circumstances leading up to his death.\nAmong many: Earlier this year, another Vietnamese national, Nhon Ngoc Nguyen, also 55, died in ICE custody at a hospital in El Paso. Nguyen had dementia and was found by autopsy to have died of acute pneumonia. ICE has reported eight deaths in its custody so far this year compared to 12 deaths last year. Advocacy groups and former officials say the true number could be higher and continue to call for stronger medical safeguards and more transparency for detainees with serious health conditions.\nWoman in deadly Chinatown crash was previously charged in Brooklyn hit-and-run\nA 23-year-old woman is facing mounting legal trouble after being charged in two major New York City incidents within months. Autumn Donna Ascencio Romero was first arrested for leaving the scene of an accident and driving without a license after an April 13 crash in Brooklyn that left a 22-year-old pedestrian with serious injuries. Weeks later, she was named as the driver in a deadly crash in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown, which killed two people and injured several others.\nBrooklyn crash details: The Brooklyn crash happened when Romero allegedly struck a woman as she was exiting an Uber in the early morning hours. The pedestrian suffered injuries to her face, neck, shoulder and collarbone. Police say Romero fled the scene and was arrested the next day. She was charged with leaving the scene of an accident causing serious injury and aggravated unlicensed operation of a vehicle. In line with New York\u2019s bail reform laws, Romero was released pending trial.\nFatal Chinatown collision: On July 19, Romero was identified as the driver in a high-speed crash in Chinatown after a stolen rental car exited the Manhattan Bridge and struck multiple people on Canal Street. The collision killed cyclist Kevin Scott Cruickshank, 55, and pedestrian May Kwok, 63. Authorities say Romero and her passenger fled the scene but were quickly apprehended. Police recovered alcohol, firearms and illegal substances from the vehicle. Romero now faces felony charges including second-degree murder, manslaughter, aggravated vehicular homicide and multiple counts of weapon and property offenses.\nLegal response, next steps: Romero\u2019s defense attorney has argued that a struggle over the steering wheel with her passenger may have contributed to the Chinatown crash and suggested Romero did not intend to cause harm. She is now being held without bail and is scheduled for additional court appearances. Meanwhile, city officials are facing calls for stricter enforcement of driving laws and accountability for those involved in serious traffic crimes.\nHonduran national allegedly kidnapped, tortured Chinese woman in Houston\nA Honduran man has been charged in Harris County, Texas, after investigators say he kidnapped a Chinese woman and held her captive for days, in a case authorities believe is connected to a larger human smuggling and sex trafficking ring.\nThe man, identified as 22-year-old Jose Armando Carcamo-Perdomo, allegedly lured the woman from New York with the promise of work as a masseuse, then confiscated her Chinese passport and locked her inside a trailer home in Houston.\nAccording to law enforcement, the victim was restrained, beaten and sexually assaulted during her five-day confinement. She was eventually discovered locked in a closet after neighbors saw her fleeing and called 911, prompting a swift response by Harris County deputies. Disturbing camera footage from Ring doorbell emerged online apparently showing Carcamo-Perdomo snatching the woman off the street and carrying her away as she kicked frantically in an attempt to escape. The woman is now receiving medical and psychological care and is being supported by victim services.\nCarcamo-Perdomo, who faces charges of aggravated kidnapping, assault and related offenses, entered the U.S. illegally in 2020 and had a deportation case dismissed in 2023. He remains in custody after his arrest on July 14, and federal immigration authorities have placed a detainer to prevent his release. The investigation is ongoing as officials seek more information about possible connections to other victims and trafficking networks in the area.\nRegistered sex offender accused of killing Asian spa owner in Florida\nA 69-year-old man identified as Chris Luchenburg has been charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of Cuiyun Fu, 54, at her Asian spa in Oakland Park, Florida. Authorities say Luchenburg, who is a registered sex offender with a listed address in Fort Lauderdale, entered Health Spa One on July 16 and fatally shot Fu inside Suite 20. Fu was found dead at the scene when deputies responded that morning.\nCourt records show Luchenburg had a prior conviction for sexual battery of a minor in Coral Springs and had previously faced domestic violence allegations. Investigators believe he knew Fu for several months before the shooting. He was arrested by the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office two days after the incident and is being held without bond following a judge\u2019s order for a mental health evaluation.\nLuchenburg appeared before a Broward County judge for a bond hearing, where the court found probable cause to proceed with the murder charge. The case remains under investigation, and authorities have not yet disclosed further details about the events leading up to the fatal shooting.\nSingapore, Japan, South Korea have the world\u2019s most powerful passports\nSingapore has once again secured the top spot in the 2024 Henley Passport Index, with its passport granting visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 194 destinations worldwide.\nThis marks the second year in a row that Singapore holds the No. 1 position. The annual index, which ranks passports based on the number of destinations their holders can access without a prior visa, highlights continued strong global mobility for Singaporean citizens.\nJapan and South Korea remain close behind, tied for second place with access to 193 destinations each. Malaysia ranks highest in Southeast Asia outside Singapore, coming in at 11th, while Hong Kong holds the 19th spot. China\u2019s passport is ranked 62nd, allowing holders visa-free or visa-on-arrival entry to 85 destinations. At the bottom end among Asian countries are Myanmar and North Korea, ranked 91st and 101st, offering considerably fewer travel options.\nThe U.S. passport ranked seventh, with visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 188 destinations. While still among the world\u2019s most powerful, the U.S. has slipped from the top tier in recent years.\nBanh mi: The \u201ccolonial sandwich\u201d that became a global icon\nThis is the first installment of a three-part series exploring the banh mi\u2019s remarkable evolution and journey to global renown.\nBanh mi, Vietnam\u2019s globally renowned sandwich, is a culinary testament to the country\u2019s colonial history, cultural adaptability and diaspora. Originally introduced through French colonization in the 19th century, the baguette evolved from a European luxury to a Vietnamese staple, ultimately transforming into the distinct and flavorful sandwich known today.\nBlend of Vietnamese, French cuisine\nThe roots of banh mi trace back to the mid-1800s when the French brought baguettes, dairy products and charcuterie to Vietnam as part of their colonial rule. Initially considered a luxury, baguettes became more accessible when Vietnamese bakers adapted them by incorporating rice flour, making the bread lighter and airier while maintaining a crisp crust.\nKeep reading with a 7-day free trial\nSubscribe to The Rebel Yellow to keep reading this post and get 7 days of free access to the full post archives."

      "text": "ICE detainee passes away at Pennsylvania's Moshannon Valley Processing Center\nPHILIPSBURG, Penn. \u2014 Chaofeng Ge, a 32-year-old citizen of China in ICE custody, was pronounced deceased by the Clearfield County coroner at approximately 6:03 a.m. on Aug. 5. The cause of death is under investigation.\nGe was detained at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Philipsburg. He had been in ICE custody for five days and was awaiting a hearing before the Department of Justice\u2019s Executive Office for Immigration Review. MVPC staff discovered Ge hanging by the neck and unresponsive in the shower room of his detention pod at 5:21 a.m. They immediately lowered him to the ground, began CPR and contacted Phillipsburg Emergency Medical Services, the Pennsylvania State Police and the coroner\u2019s office.\nOn Jan. 23, the Lower Paxton Township Police Department arrested Ge for criminal use of a communication facility, unlawful use of a computer and access device fraud. On Jan. 24, ICE Philadelphia\u2019s Enforcement and Removal Operations York sub-office lodged an immigration detainer with the Dauphin County Prison.\nGe pleaded guilty to accessing a device issued to another who did not authorize use and conspiracy to commit the same on July 31. He was sentenced to six to 12 months for each count and granted immediate release to the ICE detainer. ERO York took Ge into ICE custody and transported him to the York ICE office for processing. He was subsequently transferred to the MVPC.\nConsistent with ICE policy, ERO notified the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Office of Inspector General and the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility via the Integrity Coordination Center. ERO provided notification of the death to the Chinese Embassy.\nICE makes official notifications to Congress, nongovernmental organization stakeholders, and the media upon an official report of a detained illegal alien\u2019s death and posts a news release with relevant details on the ICE public website within two business days per agency policy. This information may be accessed in the ICE.gov Newsroom. Additionally, congressional requirements described in the DHS Appropriations Bill of 2018 require ICE to make public all reports regarding an in-custody death within 90 days.\nThese reports may be accessed on the Detainee Death Reporting page.\nICE remains committed to ensuring that all those in its custody reside in safe, secure, and humane environments. Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay. All people in ICE custody receive medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility, access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. At no time during detention is a detained illegal alien denied emergent care."

      "text": "Indian teen chess champions break records in back-to-back victories\nBy Ryan General\nAt 10 years and 3 months old, Bodhana Sivanandan of England became the youngest player to earn a Woman Grandmaster norm after a landmark tournament performance in France on July 27. Just one day later, India\u2019s 19-year-old Divya Deshmukh became the first Indian woman to win the FIDE Women\u2019s World Cup, earning the Grandmaster title and national honors.\nSivanandan sets age record\nCompeting at the Trophee Dole \u2013 Pasino Grand Aix in Aix-en-Provence, Sivanandan scored a 2401 performance rating by drawing a game against a Grandmaster and defeating multiple International Masters. The result secured her first Woman Grandmaster norm and a second norm toward the Woman International Master title. Sivanandan had previously dominated the World Under-8 Girls Championship in 2022 and made headlines in 2024 as the youngest player selected to represent England at the Chess Olympiad in Budapest.\nDeshmukh makes history\nIn Batumi, Georgia, Deshmukh clinched victory over fellow Indian Grandmaster Koneru Humpy in the final of the FIDE Women\u2019s World Cup after two classical games ended in draws. Her victory automatically granted her the Grandmaster title and a place in the 2026 Women\u2019s Candidates Tournament. Deshmukh, now India\u2019s 88th Grandmaster and the fourth Indian woman to hold the title, was honored with a cash prize of 30 million Indian rupees ($360,000).\nIndia\u2019s rising generation\nSivanandan and Deshmukh are part of a broader wave of Indian talent reshaping the global chess scene. Grandmasters such as Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa, Gukesh Dommaraju and Nihal Sarin have all emerged as serious contenders on the world stage before age 20. Dommaraju, in particular, recently became the youngest player to compete for the World Chess Championship, while Praggnanandhaa has earned wins over multiple world champions.\n\u201cPlayers like superstars\u201d\nIndia\u2019s chess federation has played a central role in nurturing its young talents through organized training, national competitions and financial support. American Grandmaster Hans Niemann, responding to Deshmukh\u2019s win, praised India\u2019s approach and criticized the lack of support in the United States. He said India \u201ctreats their players like superstars\u201d with visible backing from both the federation and government, while American players often face institutional neglect. Niemann warned that India\u2019s deep investment in player development could shift the global balance of power in chess within a decade.\nThis story is part of The Rebel Yellow Newsletter \u2014 a bold weekly newsletter from the creators of NextShark, reclaiming our stories and celebrating Asian American voices.\nSubscribe free to join the movement.

      "text": "Daniel Dae Kim makes history\nDaniel Dae Kim has made history as the first Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) actor to be nominated for best leading actor in a play at the Tony Awards.\nThe Rebel Yellow - Issue #65\nA Harvard dropout joins Elon Musk\u2019s federal AI squad and says his alma mater now \u201chates\u201d him. Kamala Harris resurfaces with a sharp rebuke of Trump\u2019s first 100 days. ICE faces scrutiny after the death of a Vietnamese refugee with dementia. Plus: Daniel Dae Kim makes Tony history, Jonny Kim cooks gochujang burgers in space, and Michigan\u2019s only Asian American woman lawmaker stands up to a public smear.\nDOGE member says friends ditched him, Harvard alma mater \u201chates me\u201d\nEthan Shaotran, a 22-year-old former Harvard student, said he has been ostracized by classmates after dropping out to join a federal reform team led by Elon Musk under the Trump administration.\n\u201cI dropped out of Harvard and came here to serve my country and it\u2019s been unfortunate to see lost friendships,\u201d Shaotran said in a May 1 interview with Fox News. \u201cMost of campus hates me now.\u201d\nLeaving Harvard behind\nShaotran left Harvard during his senior year, where he studied computer science and was known for his work in artificial intelligence. He previously founded Energize AI, a scheduling assistant for professionals that received a $100,000 grant from OpenAI in 2023.\nHe reportedly came to Musk\u2019s attention after participating in a hackathon organized by xAI, Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company. Shaotran joined DOGE, an initiative launched by executive order under President Donald Trump.\nThe team includes Akash Bobba, Edward Coristine, Luke Farritor, Gautier Cole Killian and Gavin Kliger \u2014 all aged under 25 \u2014 and has been placed in agencies such as the Office of Personnel Management and the General Services Administration, where they are tasked with identifying inefficiencies and proposing technological reforms.\nDOGE under fire\nThe initiative has come under scrutiny for giving young technologists access to sensitive government systems. DOGE\u2019s actions have drawn criticism over a lack of oversight and reports that some members have acted without proper identification or authority in federal agencies.\nDespite this, Shaotran defended the group\u2019s work. \u201cI hope people realize through conversations like this that reform is genuinely needed,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s one group of people who really have a shot at success, it\u2019s the people here. They\u2019re up until 2 a.m., Monday through Sunday. DOGE did not recognize weekends.\u201d\nSince joining the program, Shaotran said he has lost friends and faced significant criticism from former classmates. Other DOGE members have reportedly received email threats. One online post featuring DOGE staffers\u2019 photos included the phrase \u201cDead or Alive.\u201d\nFederal law enforcement was reportedly dispatched to protect the families of several DOGE members.\nHarvard versus Trump\nShaotran\u2019s interview come amid escalating tensions between Harvard and the Trump administration. The university is suing the federal government after Trump froze $2 billion in funding, accusing Harvard of failing to eliminate antisemitism on campus and dismantle its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.\nTrump said Harvard would no longer receive any government grants if it refused to meet new conditions. Harvard, in response, accused the administration of attempting to micromanage academic affairs and undermine research programs.\nThe \u201cChina link\u201d blamed for \u201cSignalgate\u201d is ousted amid MAGA pressure campaign\nDeputy national security adviser Alex Wong was the target of a Laura Loomer conspiracy theory\nAlex Wong, the principal deputy national security adviser under Mike Waltz, was removed from his post on May 1 amid the fallout from the \"Signalgate\" scandal, which exposed sensitive military plans through an unsecured messaging app. His exit comes alongside the removal of Waltz, who has since been nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\nWong's role in the Signal chat leak\nIn March, Waltz inadvertently added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a Signal group chat discussing a planned U.S. strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen. Wong, who had helped organize the virtual group for real-time coordination, was subsequently tasked with assembling a \u201ctiger team\u201d \u2014 an emergency task force \u2014 to mitigate damage and assess exposure.\nDespite the swift internal response, the leak sparked bipartisan concern on Capitol Hill about the Trump administration\u2019s use of personal messaging platforms to discuss classified military operations. Security officials criticized the lack of formal vetting and encryption safeguards.\nThe \u201cChina link\u201d\nThe dismissal of Wong, a prominent China hawk and Taiwan supporter, also followed escalating pressure from far-right activist Laura Loomer, who has publicly and privately campaigned for the removal of National Security Council staff she deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump.\nSuggesting a \u201cChina link\u201d was the reason the scandal went public, Loomer targeted Wong specifically by negatively highlighting his wife\u2019s Chinese heritage and reviving discredited claims about his family's background and past business dealings with China. While many of her assertions were unsupported by evidence, they gained traction within Trump\u2019s MAGA-aligned inner circle.\nOfficial reasoning and broader implications\nThe removals of Waltz and Wong represent the most significant reshuffle in Trump\u2019s national security leadership since the start of his current term. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been appointed interim national security adviser as the administration evaluates permanent replacements.\nWhile some reports suggest that the dismissals were due to the mishandling of classified information and internal tensions, the White House not provided an official explanation.\nKamala Harris returns to the political stage with sharp rebuke of Trump\nHer next major move may be announced by summer\u2019s end\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her first major speech since her 2024 electoral defeat last Wednesday, offering a blistering critique of President Donald Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office while carefully positioning herself for a potential political comeback.\n\u201cWe are ready for it\u201d\nSpeaking at the Emerge Gala in San Francisco, Harris accused Trump of implementing an agenda that amounts to the \u201cwholesale abandonment\u201d of America\u2019s highest ideals. She specifically targeted his economic policies, claiming his tariffs are \u201cclearly inviting a recession\u201d and setting off \u201cthe greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history.\u201d\nHarris also warned that Trump\u2019s conflicts with the courts were moving the nation toward a constitutional crisis. \u201cWe are living in a moment where the checks and balances on which we have historically relied have begun to buckle,\u201d she said.\nDespite her criticism, Harris struck a note of resilience. \u201cCourage is contagious,\u201d she told the cheering crowd, adding, \u201cThings are probably going to get worse before they get better, but we are ready for it.\u201d\nWhy this matters\nHarris\u2019 return to the spotlight comes at a critical juncture for Democrats searching for leadership after their 2024 defeat. Her reemergence suggests a calculated return to political discourse after making only limited public appearances since Trump\u2019s victory, in which he won all seven battleground states and secured a popular vote margin exceeding 2.5 million.\nMultiple polls on Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office, however, highlight significant discontent. Ahead of them, an AAPI Data/AP-NORC poll released last month shows that AANHPIs disapprove of Trump\u2019s actions on the economy and trade (71%), management of the federal government (68%) and government spending (63%) \u2014 percentages higher than the general population.\nWhat\u2019s next\nSources familiar with Harris\u2019 thinking reportedly indicate she is looking at three options: a 2026 gubernatorial bid in California, another presidential run in 2028 or stepping away from elected office entirely. She is expected to announce her next move by the end of summer, with advisors believing she needs to clarify her intentions for the governor\u2019s race by then at the latest.\nIn the meantime, Harris is scheduled to headline a major Democratic National Committee fundraiser in New York in May, as she gradually increases her political activities and private outreach to Democratic officials and strategists.\nVietnamese refugee suffering from dementia dies in ICE custody in Texas\nA 55-year-old Vietnamese refugee with dementia reportedly died of natural causes while in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody at the Long Term Acute Care Hospital in El Paso, Texas on April 16.\n\u201cSome negligence\u201d?\nNhon Ngoc Nguyen, who came to the U.S. in July 1983 and was granted legal status under the Refugee Act of 1980, was detained during a Feb. 24 appointment with ICE in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he had been living since 2018. An autopsy revealed that he died of acute pneumonia, with dementia listed as a secondary cause.\nHowever, his attorney, Tin Nguyen, said his family believes there was \u201csome negligence\u201d on ICE\u2019s part. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the details of what happened in his last days at the hospital,\u201d Tin Nguyen told the Albuquerque Journal. \u201cI think there are a lot of questions that need to be answered in how ICE treats people who are sick.\u201d\nThe family, who lives in Dallas, reportedly did not know Nguyen\u2019s whereabouts from mid-February until late March when ICE informed them he was ready for release but required constant medical care.\nWhat ICE is saying\nIn a press release, ICE noted that Nguyen had a 1991 conviction for second-degree murder in California, which violated his residency terms. The agency said he was arrested \u201cbased on his final order of removal with the significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future to Vietnam\u201d following a 2013 deportation order.\nFrom Feb. 26 until his death, Nguyen was transferred multiple times between the El Paso Processing Center and hospitals for treatment. The agency said it \u201ccoordinated closely with Nguyen\u2019s attorney to identify and contact Nguyen\u2019s family members able to take custody and care for him in the United States to no avail.\u201d\nICE maintained that it \u201cremains committed to ensuring that all those in its custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments\u201d and that \u201ccomprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay.\u201d\nSparking protest\nNguyen\u2019s death has drawn attention from immigrant rights activists. At May Day rallies across New Mexico on May 1, thousands reportedly gathered in events that celebrated workers and expressed solidarity with those targeted by the Trump administration, including immigrants.\nAttendees in Albuquerque\u2019s Tiguex Park carried Nguyen\u2019s photo. A statement from his nephew, Duke Nguyen, was read aloud.\nIndian American student wearing pro-Trump hat attacked near WSU\nA Washington State University (WSU) electrical engineering student was reportedly assaulted by a graduate student and a staff member while wearing a pro-Donald Trump hat near campus in February.\nWhat happened\nJay Sani, a 25-year-old junior, was attacked outside The Coug, a popular bar near campus on Feb. 28. Patrick Mahoney, a 34-year-old graduate student, allegedly grabbed Sani\u2019s \u201cTrump 2024 TAKE AMERICA BACK\u201d hat and threw it into the road. When Sani responded by throwing his food bag toward Mahoney, both Mahoney and Gerald Hoff, a 24-year-old research assistant, allegedly took Sani to the ground and each delivered a punch.\n\u201cI\u2019m an engineering student that wants to get the degree, and move on. So what if I like someone that you don\u2019t like,\u201d Sani wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cWe have the First Amendment, and it\u2019s not okay that just because you don\u2019t like that person, I should be attacked for it.\u201d\nArrest and charges\nBody camera footage reportedly shows both men admitting to striking Sani, with Mahoney hitting him in the face and Hoff striking his legs. Both suspects were arrested, charged with misdemeanor fourth-degree assault and later released. According to police reports, Mahoney, who wore a shirt reading \u201cMARX WAS RIGHT,\u201d told officers, \u201cYou wanna wear the hat, hey, there\u2019s gonna be a price to pay.\u201d\nFired from teaching\nWSU has since relieved Mahoney of all teaching responsibilities, while Hoff has been terminated from his staff position. Phil Weiler, WSU vice president of marketing and communications, told KREM 2, \u201cThere\u2019s no place on our campus for people who may be disrespectful, may be unwilling to let people express their views.\u201d\nSani said he is sharing the news \u201cbecause of how toxic the left has gotten.\u201d The 2018 Pullman High School graduate, who also serves as president of the WSU College Republicans and secretary of the WSU chapter of the conservative group Turning Point USA, has pre-trial hearings scheduled for May 22 for Hoff and May 29 for Mahoney.\nThe Rebel Yellow has reached out to Sani for updates.\nWisconsin forms Legislative Asian Caucus in historic first\nThree Wisconsin Democratic representatives announced the formation of the state\u2019s first Legislative Asian Caucus on Thursday, marking the beginning of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.\nWho they are\nThe caucus includes Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), the daughter of Korean immigrants who was first elected in 2020, alongside freshmen lawmakers Rep. Angelito Tenorio (D-West Allis), the first Filipino American elected to the state Legislature, and Rep. Renuka Mayadev (D-Madison), the first South Asian American elected to the Assembly.\nHong, who chairs the caucus, said it ensures Asian American communities are better represented, heard and included in legislative work. \u201cAANHPI communities in Wisconsin have been integral to the fabric of Wisconsin for generations. However, their needs are often not part of policy conversations,\u201d she noted. Meanwhile, Tenorio pledged, \u201cWe\u2019re here to fight for justice, strengthen our communities and make Wisconsin the best it can be for everyone.\u201d\nWhy it matters\nThe caucus forms as Asian Americans constitute 6% of Wisconsin\u2019s population, with the state hosting the nation\u2019s third-largest Hmong community. Last year, Gov. Tony Evers proclaimed May 14 as Hmong-Lao Veterans Day, honoring Hmong Lao veterans who fought alongside U.S. troops during the Vietnam War.\nThe group will host events throughout May highlighting Asian American contributions, including sessions focused on Japanese internment, celebrating the Hmong community and uplifting Filipino stories. \u201cOur hope is that this Caucus will foster new connections for advocacy, policymaking and collaboration,\u201d Mayadev said.\nMichigan lawmaker responds to colleague\u2019s insults that she is \u201cvery low IQ\u201d\nMichigan State Rep. Mai Xiong (D-Warren) issued a forceful response after House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) publicly called her \u201ca very low IQ representative\u201d and \u201cprobably one of the dumbest ones in the legislature\u201d during a press briefing on April 30.\nWhat happened\nThe confrontation began when Hall launched into a series of insults directed at Xiong after she criticized him for canceling the previous day\u2019s legislative session to attend a rally with President Donald Trump marking his first 100 days in office. \u201cWe have this very low IQ representative named Mai Xiong, probably one of the dumbest ones in the Legislature, and I saw this video of her, and she\u2019s like \u2018the House Speaker is not here today. We need to have session. You know? We need to work for the people of Michigan, Macomb County,\u2019\u201d Hall told reporters.\nHe then defended his absence, saying he was \u201cdelivering a new mission with President Trump for Selfridge Air Force Base\u201d while claiming Xiong was \u201cdoing nothing for her county and for her district.\u201d\nStanding up to \u201cbullies\u201d\nXiong, the first Hmong American elected to the Michigan House \u2014 and currently the only Asian American woman in the Michigan legislature \u2014 responded with a statement later that day, saying she was \u201cdeeply disheartened and disappointed\u201d by Hall\u2019s remarks. \u201cThese words weren\u2019t just disrespectful \u2014 they were meant to demean, belittle and devalue,\u201d she said. She also countered Hall\u2019s claims by highlighting her legislative work and criticizing Hall for allegedly violating the Michigan Constitution by \u201chijacking\u201d nine bills, including one she authored to support public workers.\nIn a follow-up statement over the weekend, Xiong emphasized the importance of accountability. \u201cI want my children and others to know that standing up to bullies is always the right thing to do,\u201d she stressed. \u201cI want them to see that strong leadership means lifting others up not tearing them down.\u201d\nThis is not the first time Xiong has had to deal with offensive remarks. Last year, she was also forced to release a statement after facing racially motivated attacks on social media, including accusations that she is a member of the Chinese Communist Party.\nDaniel Dae Kim is the 1st Asian American to be nominated for Tony lead actor award\nDaniel Dae Kim has made history as the first Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) actor to be nominated for best leading actor in a play at the Tony Awards, earning recognition for his role in the Broadway revival of \u201cYellow Face.\u201d The 2025 nominations, announced May 1, mark a groundbreaking year for Asian representation on Broadway.\nKim plays a satirical version of playwright David Henry Hwang in \u201cYellow Face,\u201d a semi-autobiographical play exploring race and identity. The production also earned nominations for best revival of a play and best featured actor in a play for Francis Jue.\nThis year\u2019s ceremony shattered previous records with seven Asian performers nominated across acting categories \u2014 more than any other year in Tony history. In addition to Kim and Jue, nominees include Conrad Ricamora (\u201cOh, Mary!\u201d), Darren Criss (\u201cMaybe Happy Ending\u201d), Nicole Scherzinger (\u201cSunset Boulevard\u201d) and Iranian actresses Tala Ashe and Marjan Neshat (English), the first Asian performers ever nominated for featured actress in a play.\nKim\u2019s milestone follows in the legacy of BD Wong, who became the first Asian actor to win a Tony in 1988 for \u201cM. Butterfly,\u201d also written by Hwang. Only four Asian performers \u2014 Wong, Lea Salonga, Michael Aronov and Ruthie Ann Miles \u2014 have won Tonys to date.\nThe 78th Annual Tony Awards will air live on June 8 from Radio City Music Hall in New York City.\nKorean American astronaut Jonny Kim shares gochujang burger recipe from space\nNASA astronaut Jonny Kim, the first Korean American to fly to space, recently shared a video of himself preparing and eating a burger made with Taeyang gochujang aboard the International Space Station (ISS).\nIn an Instagram post dated April 30, the 41-year-old introduced his \u201cranger burger,\u201d writing, \"If you've lived on MREs (military-issued meals ready to eat), you've probably tried some creative field recipes.\"\nThe ranger burger is a simple hamburger that U.S. soldiers make as instant food, similar to Korea\u2019s \u201cgundaria.\u201d Kim\u2019s version featured steak, cheese and potato gratin stacked on wheat snack bread, topped generously with gochujang. \u201cI miss my family\u2019s cooking, and this was quite fitting,\u201d he wrote.\nHe took a photo of the floating meal inside the Unity module, which connects the U.S. and Russian segments of the station. The module contains a shared table where astronauts and cosmonauts often gather for group meals.\nKim was selected as one of 12 astronaut candidates from a pool of about 18,000 applicants in 2017 and officially joined NASA\u2019s astronaut corps in 2020. He arrived at the ISS on April 8 aboard the Soyuz MS-27 spacecraft and is scheduled to spend about seven more months conducting scientific research and technology demonstrations.\n\u201cWeird\u201d \u2026 Mark Zuckerberg gifts wife Priscilla Chan a 7-foot turquoise statue of herself\nMark Zuckerberg recently confessed that his wife Priscilla Chan was unimpressed by the seven-foot turquoise and silver statue of herself that appeared on their front lawn last August.\nCatch up: Zuckerberg first unveiled the statue created by pop artist Daniel Arsham on Instagram, claiming he was \u201cbringing back the Roman tradition of making sculptures of your wife.\u201d Chan, who was then photographed with the sculpture, wrote in the comments, \u201cThe more of me the better?\u201d along with a heart emoji. The extravagant gift joins a list of unusual gestures from the Meta chief, including a customized Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT in October and a Benson Boone-inspired piano performance for Chan\u2019s 40th birthday in February.\n\u201cThat\u2019s weird\u201d: In a recent appearance on the \u201cThis Past Weekend\u201d podcast, Zuckerberg revealed that Chan was not actually receptive to the lawn sculpture. \u201cI don\u2019t think she was that happy with it,\u201d Zuckerberg admitted, adding that she was a \u201cgood sport\u201d nonetheless. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want a sculpture of her in the front lawn \u2014 that\u2019s weird,\u201d he continued. He confessed the statue was more for himself as an Arsham fan and ominously added, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to wait and see what I have to do to make up having made a sculpture.\u201d"

      "text": "Gene Wu defiant against Greg Abbott\u2019s attempt to remove him from Texas House seat\nBy Carl Samson\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott filed an emergency petition Tuesday with the state Supreme Court to remove Rep. Gene Wu (D-Houston), chair of the Texas Democratic Caucus, after he and dozens of other Democrats defiantly left the state to block a Republican redistricting vote.\nDriving the news: The Democrats traveled to Boston, Chicago and New York City over the weekend to prevent Republicans from securing the quorum needed to pass congressional maps that would add five GOP-friendly seats before the 2026 midterms. Abbott\u2019s suit names Wu as the \u201cringleader\u201d of the walkout, alleging his actions amount to abandoning his position. The governor further claims Wu and the other Democrats \u201cappear to have solicited and received certain benefits in exchange for skipping a vote, further supporting their removal from office and allegations of bribery.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Attorney General Ken Paxton\u2019s office asked the Texas Supreme Court to delay its decision, arguing that \u201conly his office or the offices of a district or county attorney could bring the type of case that Abbott filed.\u201d But he also announced he would petition to remove absent Democrats, warning, \u201cIf you don\u2019t show up to work, you get fired.\u201d\nWhat Wu is saying: Wu dismissed Abbott\u2019s threats in a CNN interview Monday, saying, \u201cFrankly, Democrats say, \u2018Come and take it\u2019\u201d and calling the governor\u2019s efforts \u201call bluster.\u201d In a statement, he characterized his absence as fulfilling his constitutional oath rather than abandoning his duties. \u201cThis office does not belong to Greg Abbott, and it does not belong to me. It belongs to the people of House District 137, who elected me. I took an oath to the Constitution, not a politician\u2019s agenda, and I will not be the one to break that oath,\u201d Wu said.\nWu, the chamber\u2019s lone Chinese American member, previously opposed legislation restricting Chinese property ownership, saying it sent \u201ca loud and clear message that Asians don\u2019t belong in this country.\u201d Abbott eventually signed the bill into law. Now, Wu frames his resistance in moral terms. \u201cWhen a governor conspires with a disgraced president to ram through a racist gerrymandered map, my constitutional duty is to not be a willing participant,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen that governor holds disaster relief for 137 dead Texans and their families hostage, my moral duty is to sound the alarm \u2014 by any means necessary.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s next: Legal experts question Abbott\u2019s authority to remove elected lawmakers. Ross Miller, president of the Democratic Lawyers Association of Texas, told CNN there is no legal precedent for such action, while Rice University professor Mark Jones told CBS Texas that lawmakers can only be removed through a two-thirds legislative vote.\nShould the removal efforts succeed, special elections would be required to fill the vacant seats. Appeals could also stretch well beyond the special session\u2019s Aug. 19 deadline.\nThis story is part of The Rebel Yellow Newsletter \u2014 a bold weekly newsletter from the creators of NextShark, reclaiming our stories and celebrating Asian American voices.\nSubscribe free to join the movement.
