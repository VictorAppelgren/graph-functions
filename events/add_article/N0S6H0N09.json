      "summary": "Indian state and federal ministers will convene for two days to decide on the largest cuts to the Goods and Services Tax in eight years, aiming to boost domestic demand amid U.S. tariff pressures. The plan would reduce rates on over 400 items, moving many goods into a 5% or 18% bracket, and is expected to lift sales for FMCG, electronics and auto firms. Economists warn the cuts could cost $21 billion in revenue, with states facing larger losses than the federal government.",
