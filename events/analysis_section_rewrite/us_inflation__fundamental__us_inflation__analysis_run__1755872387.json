      "feedback": "The analysis draft provides a solid overview of the current macroeconomic landscape, but it could benefit from enhanced clarity and depth in several areas. First, strengthen the causal chain by explicitly linking how tariff policies directly influence inflation and labor market dynamics, using specific data points to illustrate these connections. Incorporate more quantitative analysis, such as potential ranges for inflation and interest rates, to ground your predictions in numerical context. Additionally, ensure that the discussion aligns with the multi-year horizon focus by articulating longer-term implications of current trends, such as structural changes in consumer behavior or shifts in monetary policy. Finally, increase citation density by referencing specific sources for key claims, particularly regarding the Fed's decision-making process and market expectations. This will enhance credibility and provide a clearer path for readers to follow your reasoning.",
