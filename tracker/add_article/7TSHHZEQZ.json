      "summary": "Boeing has cut its Q2 loss to $612 million from $1.4 billion, and cash burn fell from $4.3 billion to $200 million, but the company remains cash‑hungry. CEO Kelly Ortberg says 2025 could be a turnaround year as production of the 737 MAX and 787 ramps up and the firm seeks FAA permission to lift the 38‑plane cap. Boeing also secured new defense contracts and is navigating regulatory delays for the 777X and MAX‑7, while the Air India 787 crash and ongoing quality investigations weigh on the outlook.",
