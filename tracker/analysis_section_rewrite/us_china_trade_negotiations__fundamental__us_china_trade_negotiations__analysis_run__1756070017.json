      "feedback": "This draft has a solid, cross‑source throughline (tariffs, onshoring, export controls, and tech‑policy signaling) but it needs a world‑class upgrade: tighten the causal chain, embed invariant anchors, and quantify the regime structure over a multi‑year horizon. Actionable edits in one paragraph: 1) Add first‑principles anchors and regime map (horizon multi‑year): state explicit anchors such as real rate differentials (US vs peers), terms of trade shifts from rare earth/minerals leverage, and the BoP/industrial‑policy stance toward onshore capacity. Define regimes: a baseline “rollover/no major new tariffs” regime; a subsequent “limited, verifiable concessions” regime; and an escalation/de‑facto decoupling regime if export controls tighten or China escalates rare earth leverage. For each regime, specify transition conditions (e.g., if export‑control lists expand by X items or if China imposes new rare earth restraints) and the causal chain to pricing (policy → capex/EMS investment → supplier pricing and equity re‑rating). 2) Strengthen the multi‑year causal chain with concrete links and data points: tariffs and rollover feed capex in domestic foundries and AI/energy infrastructure (cite SGB2PAZGK); government equity stakes (Intel 10% via CHIPS Act) signal public‑private signaling and potential peer pressure (3ITAKK6XJ); China leverage on rare earths/minerals and pharmaceuticals tightens supply risk and motivates diversification (SGB2PAZGK). 3) Quantify the triggers and invalidation points: give base‑case numbers where possible (e.g., 90‑day rollover; 145% initial Chinese tariff; 10% baseline; 34% China tariff after escalation; 60%/90% rare earth output shares cited) and tie them to market signals (NVIDIA/AMD licensing, Intel stake impact, capex timing). 4) Reconcile conflicts and cover all critical sources: acknowledge the 90‑day extension vs the more extreme “80% tariff” chatter and the NVIDIA scaled‑back sale option as conditional, citing the relevant sources, and map how each path would alter the regime probabilities. 5) Refine structure to deliver base case, key risks, watch points, and confidence with explicit probabilities and a short narrative around policy reaction functions (Fed/RBA context in the Bloomberg/Asia‑trade frame) to meet the SECTION FOCUS. 6) Improve formatting cues and signal the medium/long‑run transmission channels (risk of policy missteps, supply‑chain re‑routing, and equity/credit repricing) and provide a tight, single paragraph conclusion that names the base case, the primary risks (rare earth bottlenecks, export‑control rollback, tariff shocks), and the clearest watch list (export‑control evolution, chip licensing, Intel/NVIDIA/AMD licensing dynamics, and RBA/Fed policy path). This will elevate depth, rigor, and actionable insight across the horizon. Citations to carry through correspond to the IDs 0UOO8VW2V, KFTWPFGAF, 3ITAKK6XJ, SGB2PAZGK, and 40M82JY72.",
