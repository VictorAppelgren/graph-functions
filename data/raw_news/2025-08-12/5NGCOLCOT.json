  "description": "After eight years away, they have returned to the Premier League with a new confidence and plenty of ambition",
  "content": "On the corridor wall outside David Bruce\u2019s office in Black Cat House, there is a framed piece of paper that has fundamentally changed Sunderland\u2019s world.\n\nIt is their Premier League share certificate, awarded to the club\u2019s owner Kyril Louis-Dreyfus at the AGM dinner in early June, displayed for all to see. Sunderland\u2019s, if you were wondering, was the 128th certificate issued.\n\n\u201cYou need to look at that,\u201d an enthusiastic Bruce, Sunderland\u2019s chief business officer and lifelong supporter, tells The Athletic. \u201cIt shows what we\u2019re all part of. My job is to help keep it on that wall.\u201d\n\nNot since 2017, when meekly surrendering to relegation from the Premier League under David Moyes, have Sunderland held a ticket to the party that begins again with the visit of West Ham United this weekend. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced a buzz like this,\u201d adds Bruce. \u201cIt\u2019s palpable.\u201d\n\nTickets for Saturday\u2019s opening game all went within a day of going on sale. Season cards, too, are long gone. Kit sales have never been higher and the club shop, two floors below that share certificate, has a snaking queue of supporters wishing to add Premier League badges to the sleeves of new shirts.\n\nEight years were spent awaiting this moment. There was the ignominy of falling into League One and then the long, arduous road back that climaxed with promotion via the Championship play-off final in May. Those dramatic victories over Coventry City and Sheffield United are already the stuff of Wearside legend.\n\nThere is the very real danger of the Premier League\u2019s formidable strength quickly putting an end to Sunderland\u2019s rise in the coming months but this is a very different club to the one that parted with English football\u2019s elite.\n\nThe ambition now is to be sustainable and strategic after a string of wasteful, aimless years began a ruinous slide captured on the Netflix documentary Sunderland Til I Die. Even with this summer\u2019s spending \u2014 \u00a3121m ($163m) and counting \u2014 it is stressed there will be no deviation from the plans that have brought them this far.\n\n\u201cKyril has a very clear vision,\u201d says Bruce. \u201cIt\u2019s been, \u2018How do we build a football club that\u2019s sustainable?\u2019. Doing the right things on and off the pitch, building a club that people can really buy into.\n\n\u201cA lot has been written about what\u2019s been done on the pitch, young talent and creating a platform for them, but a big part of what Kyril has pushed on the business side is to understand how we build a club that reconnects with the people.\u201d\n\nIt has been no small task.\n\n\u201cThe feelings the fans had towards the club and the players that played here (in 2016-17) would suggest there was a real separation,\u201d he adds. \u201cFor this part of the world to have that is really quite upsetting. What you\u2019ve got now is something that fans recognise as being theirs.\u201d\n\nWest Ham\u2019s visit on Saturday promises to be a spectacle but it will not beat the delirium felt when the Stadium of Light last hosted a competitive match. Dan Ballard\u2019s extra-time header to sink Coventry in the Championship play-off semi-final second leg was the cue for feral celebrations and the platform for more of the same as Sheffield United were then beaten at Wembley.\n\nThat stroked finish from Tommy Watson, now a Brighton & Hove Albion player, was as big as any in Sunderland\u2019s modern history; cathartic and the sudden catalyst for what could be transformative change.\n\nReturning to the Premier League was always Louis-Dreyfus\u2019 stated aim when taking a controlling stake in Sunderland from Stewart Donald in February 2021. The son of Robert Louis-Dreyfus, the late former owner of Marseille, made it clear at the start of 2021-22 that a five-year plan could guide Sunderland from the backwaters of League One and up to the Premier League. It took just four.\n\nThere were missteps along the way, like defeat by Lincoln City in the League One play-offs and the disastrous appointment of Michael Beale, but Louis-Dreyfus, still only 27, has turned Sunderland into a club feeling good about itself once more.\n\n\u201cKyril is a very progressive young guy,\u201d says Bruce, who was convinced to step down from his position as chief marketing officer at Major League Soccer to return to his home city last year.\n\n\u201cHe sees the world differently to many owners, who probably grew up consuming sports on radio and in newspapers. Kyril has grown up with the mobile phone and social media.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very thoughtful, he\u2019s very thorough. There\u2019s a lot of noise around this club with a lot of scale but he\u2019s good at hearing the feeling and staying resolute towards good plans.\n\n\u201cIn football it\u2019s very easy to get drawn into the emotions and move away from plans because things happen in real time to move you off course. You have to listen to some of that but you also have to stay the course with plans you believe in. For such a young person to have that steadiness is a real quality.\u201d\n\nSunderland\u2019s methods in coming this far have barely altered in the past four years, even when irritating a string of head coaches.\n\nNew arrivals have typically been under 23 with the potential to develop into assets. Jobe Bellingham went from being a \u00a31.5m signing from Birmingham City to a \u00a332m player sold to Borussia Dortmund this summer. The year before it was Jack Clarke, sold to Ipswich Town for \u00a315m and the year before that, Ross Stewart, who Southampton paid \u00a39m to sign.\n\nReinvestment has regularly been smart, such as moves for Ballard, Dennis Cirkin, Romaine Mundle and Eliezer Mayenda, which have complemented the emergence of academy graduates that include Anthony Patterson, Chris Rigg, Dan Neil and Watson.\n\nWages have been controlled along the way. Figures from the 2023-24 season, the last available club accounts, showed salary costs to be 81 per cent of turnover, way below the Championship average.\n\nSustainability has always been the buzzword and it stretches to the business outlook of a club that was the ninth-best supported in England last season, with an average home crowd of just under 40,000.\n\n\u201cFor us to be successful, a modern football club at the highest level, it\u2019s the ability to take advantage of the scale and reach you have,\u201d says Bruce. \u201cYou have to build your revenue streams. If you sit here and you don\u2019t grow revenue streams, then your football club stagnates. It does not grow and others go past you very quickly. You can\u2019t become the club your fans want you to be, and from the business side we\u2019re very cognisant of that.\u201d\n\nSunderland, inevitably, will enjoy record revenues in this coming season. There is a guarantee to earn at least \u00a3110m from the Premier League pot (almost three times the club\u2019s turnover in 2023-24), as well as matchday and commercial income climbing to new highs.\n\nKit sales, in particular, have seen enormous growth. A partnership with Hummel, the Danish manufacturer that formerly supplied the club\u2019s kits between 1988 and 1994, led to output trebling last season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve moved from about 33,000, 34,000 shirts two seasons ago (when with Nike) to circa 100,000 shirts in our first season with Hummel,\u201d says Bruce. \u201cThat puts you top 10 in the country. What we\u2019re seeing is unprecedented here. There were 500 people here when we launched our home shirt last month, before the store even opened.\u201d\n\nThere has also been increased demand for tickets. North of 30,000 season cards were sold before the Wembley victory and the limits were reached within 48 hours of being placed on sale in June. With corporate hospitality offerings taking season-ticket holders to 41,000 and Michelin star chef Tommy Banks now overseeing high-end food on site, it is the first time since the capacity of the Stadium of Light was increased in 2000 that supply cannot meet demand.\n\nThe summer weeks have only served to heighten the anticipation.\n\nFormer West Ham defender Arthur Masuaku became Sunderland\u2019s 10th signing over the weekend, with the capture of Switzerland international Granit Xhaka underlining ambitions to buck a trend that has seen the last six promoted clubs all suffer relegation inside a year. Twice the club transfer record was broken, first to turn Enzo Le Fee\u2019s loan from Roma into a \u00a319m deal and then when signing Habib Diarra from Strasbourg for \u00a330m.\n\nSunderland\u2019s net spend, offset by the exits of Bellingham and Watson, currently stands in the region of \u00a385m, with an expectation for further signings to arrive before the transfer deadline.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s headroom based on how the club has been run in the last few years,\u201d explains Bruce. \u201cWe\u2019ve been sensible with how we\u2019ve spent based on the revenue afforded to us as a football club and we\u2019ll always have that in mind. We can\u2019t spend beyond our means and we haven\u2019t since Kyril took over. We make X, we spend Y. It\u2019s as simple as that, so if we can build revenues, that gives us greater opportunity to spend on the football side.\u201d\n\nSunderland will be disadvantaged when only allowed to lose \u00a361m over their next three-year assessment period but the Premier League\u2019s profit and sustainability rules, says Bruce, are not a concern.\n\n\u201cOur approach in the window has been well measured,\u201d he says. \u201cWe spent a lot of time as an executive team on what our revenues are going to look like and where we\u2019ve come from in the last couple of years.\n\n\u201cWhat can we spend? What\u2019s the anchor point on wages and what\u2019s the money we can spend in the market? We\u2019re doing it with a view to being a sustainable football club but with every chance of staying in the league. We feel confident. Like what happened in the last parts of last season, where people came together, the feeling around the club can give us a very good chance.\u201d",

      "text": "Regis Le Bris is a quiet, understated figurehead, but an hour and a half after guiding Sunderland to Premier League promotion, he found the words to unwittingly capture the beauty of a journey that had ended at Wembley.\n\u201cTo create this connection, this memory, for the fans and for us, we needed to live the tough moments,\u201d said Sunderland\u2019s head coach.\nAdvertisement\nLe Bris was talking about Tommy Watson\u2019s sumptuous 95th-minute winner to kill off Sheffield United in the Championship play-off final and the collective resilience of his young group that had set it all up.\nYet Sunderland\u2019s really tough moments had not come here. Or even this season.\nThey had come with a home defeat by Burton Albion that confirmed relegation to League One in 2018. And when losing to Lincoln City, Shrewsbury Town and Gillingham in the 2019-20 season to eventually record the club\u2019s lowest finish.\nThere were also the humiliations \u2014 losing 5-1 at Rotherham United and 6-0 at Bolton Wanderers \u2014 and enough stumbles to see seven managers sacked in as many years.\nSunderland fans have lived all those tough moments and more since falling out of the Premier League in 2017, but the club\u2019s return granted a collective catharsis. It was the hard yards travelled, sometimes on hands and knees, that made this so special.\nThe semi-final win over Coventry City 11 days earlier had brought a volcanic explosion at the Stadium of Light but victory over Sheffield United felt more of an emotional release. There were tears of joy among the 40,000 at Wembley\u2019s western end and celebrations to mirror those of Crystal Palace seven days earlier in the FA Cup final. Sunderland had not waited as long for such a moment, but they had suffered far more in recent times.\nSunderland rode their luck, perhaps as they had over two legs against Coventry, but the connection between Le Bris, his players and supporters has grown undeniable. A team that finished 16th in the Championship last season has been carefully restructured into an accomplished unit. There is promise and potential but, when it has mattered most, a togetherness and unity.\nAnd now they are a Premier League club once more. A new season will begin in August with England\u2019s elite returning to Wearside and the hope will be that momentum can help bridge a widening gap between the top flight and second tier. Doubts over disparities, both sporting and financial, can wait.\nAdvertisement\nSunderland have at least become a team worthy of their supporters\u2019 backing once more. It is a squad with its imperfections but there is youth and vibrancy from front to back.\n\u201cWe needed talented players and we needed a strong connection between them,\u201d said Le Bris, outlining the subtle alterations of a reign that began two days before pre-season last summer. \u201cThey worked so well together and, at the end, this game is a good example of the season.\u201d\nThe tiny pity is that Watson will go no further with Sunderland. The latest graduate of the club\u2019s academy was sold to Brighton & Hove Albion for \u00a310million ($13.5m) last month, with the deal being concluded once the summer transfer window opens.\nThat had triggered a backlash from a small section of fans questioning Watson\u2019s motives but a moment of brilliance from the 19-year-old \u2014 that cute, rolled finish from 25 yards out \u2014 has now transformed his legacy. It stands as the most important goal a Sunderland player has scored at Wembley since Ian Porterfield struck a winner in the 1973 FA Cup final against Leeds United.\n\u201cI can\u2019t really put it into words to be honest,\u201d said Watson in a pitchside interview with Sky Sports afterwards. \u201cLook around, it\u2019s f***ing unbelievable.\u201d\nLe Bris, forced to have his moment with the trophy by his players, would have agreed. Promotion was a faint prospect when he snapped a run of 10 British managers appointed by Sunderland last summer and the remodelling of a talented squad has seen all expectations surpassed.\nLe Bris has been everything Sunderland needed. A football obsessive, he has immersed himself in life as the club\u2019s head coach, working long days and leaving his family at home in France. The development of Sunderland\u2019s best youngsters has also accelerated and with that has come collective improvements.\nAdvertisement\nAt no point were Sunderland ever out of the Championship\u2019s top six but it required something more to get past a Sheffield United side that had finished the regular season 14 points better off.\nFor more than half of Saturday\u2019s contest, it seemed beyond Sunderland, who looked as uncomfortable as Le Bris \u2014 typically a tracksuit manager \u2014 did in his suit and tie on the touchline. Tyrese Campbell\u2019s opener after 25 minutes preyed upon Sunderland\u2019s shortcomings on the break and only VAR, unused in the Championship all season, denied Sheffield United a second as Harrison Burrows\u2019 volley was ruled out when Vinicius Souza was adjudged to have been offside. \u201cThat gave them belief,\u201d lamented Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder.\nSunderland\u2019s improvements were clear after the break but it was the changes made by Le Bris that were telling.\nAttackers Watson, Patrick Roberts and Wilson Isidor were all introduced, with captain Dan Neil among those sacrificed. It was Roberts\u2019 clever through ball that teed up Eliezer Mayenda to rifle in a stunning finish and Watson who pounced upon Kieffer Moore\u2019s slack lay-off to drive at his opponents in stoppage time. The winger\u2019s precise right-foot finish took an age to find the bottom corner, allowing time for a collective breath to be drawn at that end of the stadium. Le Bris\u2019 bravery, ending the game with a 4-2-4 formation, was rewarded emphatically.\nThe aftermath encouraged Sunderland\u2019s head coach to look forward and on to next season, with questions focused upon this group\u2019s ability to compete in the Premier League and the challenges Le Bris will face up against the likes of Arne Slot and Pep Guardiola.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think about the consequences of defeat or now,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it will be the case in the next few days but let\u2019s enjoy, celebrate and take time with family and friends.\u201d\nSunderland\u2019s triumph was a moment that demanded to be lived in the here and now.\n\u201cF***ing Premier League,\u201d screamed the excellent Jobe Bellingham at Sunderland\u2019s fans during the celebrations, prodding the badge on his chest. They did not need telling.\n(Top photo: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Sunderland failed to win again on Saturday. Leading 1-0 at Doncaster Rovers, they conceded an equaliser three minutes into second-half stoppage time to draw 1-1. After losing at home to MK Dons the week before, Sunderland are eighth in League One and becoming part of the furniture in their third season in the third tier.\nAdvertisement\nDoncaster\u2019s equaliser was met with weariness in Sunderland. There is pessimism about the team, the state of the club and its direction. \u201cDismal\u201d was the Saturday night verdict from fans\u2019 site Roker Report.\nBut there is one hope. In the south of France, Saturday\u2019s game is likely to have been monitored by a 23-year-old named Kyril Louis-Dreyfus. He is understood to be considering taking on a majority shareholding in Sunderland. The club declined to comment when approached by The Athletic but chief executive Jim Rodwell said last month they had a preferred bidder currently in a period of exclusivity.\nNothing is certain and supporter scepticism is high when it comes to anything to do with the current ownership. Other alleged takeovers have already come and gone. There is also audible local concern that someone so young could be taking over an institution formed in 1879.\nYet even at the tender age of 23, Louis-Dreyfus may have been preparing for this moment for several years already. He does not appear to be a novice. This is someone who was brought up at French heavyweights Marseille and who went to Yorkshire to study the game and the football industry.\nMost importantly for Sunderland, his interest is said to be sincere and serious.\nLouis-Dreyfus is anything but an ordinary young man. The son of Margarita and Robert, he is one of three heirs to the Louis Dreyfus Company. Their worldwide empire has involvement in agriculture, food processing and international shipping, and amassed sales worth \u00a333.6 billion in its most recent financial year.\n\u201cWas he groomed from a very early age to take on responsibility? Absolutely,\u201d says a well-positioned source. \u201cMargarita wanted to make sure their children would not be stupid, just spending daddy\u2019s money. It would\u2019ve gone against their father\u2019s personality to be like that.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThey wanted them to be well-rounded individuals who have travelled an awful lot, to learn how difficult it was in the business world.\u201d\nMargarita told Bloomberg in a rare interview in 2012 that Kyril and his twin bother Maurice had been taken to Brazil during a school break to tour the family\u2019s ports, plantations and juice factories. There have also been educational trips to Russia and a year at boarding school in Singapore.\nLouis-Dreyfus, however, also has football in the blood. His late father Robert was Marseille\u2019s largest shareholder from 1996 until his death from leukaemia in 2009, when control of the club was handed to Margarita.\nIt was then, during Kyril\u2019s teenage years, that the bug bit. Although elder brother Eric and twin Maurice rarely showed a prolonged interest in the fortunes of Marseille, Kyril is said to have wanted little more than to be in the bosom of his boyhood club. An internship was spent at Marseille\u2019s training ground, officially the Centre d\u2019entrainement Robert Louis-Dreyfus but known as La Commanderie, when still at school: one of his tasks was to drive staff around in golf buggies from one location to another.\nSources say Vincent Labrune, the club\u2019s former president, became a father figure to him, inviting the youngster along to see transfers and contracts being negotiated.\n\u201cKyril has a clear understanding of the football world because of Vincent,\u201d one source told The Athletic. \u201cHe saw all the good things but all the bad things also. Agents, money, who goes and stays. Good buys, bad buys. He saw everything.\u201d He watched the tumultuous reign of Marcelo Bielsa unfold at close hand when the Leeds United manager spent just over a year at the Stade Velodrome.\nManchester City\u2019s Benjamin Mendy, who played for Marseille between 2013 and 2016, and current vice-captain Florian Thauvin are also said to regard Louis-Dreyfus as a younger brother, such was his presence around the first-team squad.\nAdvertisement\nLouis-Dreyfus told France Football magazine in 2015 he would regularly travel between Marseille and Geneva, where he attended school, to watch his family club and in 2012 he took that devotion further. Although he was by then attending boarding school in Singapore, he travelled back to Europe to see Marseille seal a famous Champions League victory over Inter Milan in the last 16. \u201cThat was worth it!\u201d he said.\nLouis-Dreyfus is understood to be a compulsive player of Football Manager, the popular computer game, and there have been long-standing ambitions to step into an industry that shaped his upbringing.\nDespite Margarita Louis-Dreyfus selling Marseille to Frank McCourt in 2016, a five per cent stake was held back for Kyril. Previous takeover talks with Gerard Lopez, now the owner of fellow French top-flight side Lille, reportedly collapsed when the Spanish businessman declined to let the Louis-Dreyfus family retain a minority shareholding.\nMarseille has significance to the Louis-Dreyfus family and, as such, there have been supporters wondering if the natural lineage was for Kyril to retake his father\u2019s old position as owner. Didier Deschamps, head coach of France\u2019s world-champion national team, has even admitted to floating the idea of succession with the young heir.\n\u201cThe Louis-Dreyfus family had a lot of problems before they sold but I\u2019m certain he still knows every player \u2014 who is good and who is bad,\u201d said one source. \u201cHe loves Marseille but he thinks Sunderland is better because it is interesting and also quieter. He will try to apply some ideas he has on football business but also grow up with the club.\u201d\nPrivately, there is optimism Louis-Dreyfus can secure a deal that would introduce him to English football from the banks of the Wear. Reports in L\u2019Equipe, the renowned French sports newspaper, have even suggested Louis-Dreyfus has already considered who he wants to become sporting director at the Stadium of Light. The potential of Sunderland is said to be the attraction; an opportunity to rebuild a club who already have both a modern stadium and a training ground fit for the Premier League.\n\u201cHe will not spend like an oligarch,\u201d says a source. \u201cThis is not like buying a helicopter. It\u2019s rational. It will be a project. He is passionate about football and he sees this project as interesting. He is taking it very seriously. He will not come into it to lose money.\u201d\nThe thread linking Louis-Dreyfus to Sunderland is Juan Sartori, a Uruguayan businessman and politician whose Russian father-in-law, Dmitry Rybolovlev, owns Monaco, neighbours and rivals of Marseille. Sartori, who married Rybolovlev\u2019s daughter Ekaterina on the family\u2019s privately-owned Greek island of Skorpios in 2015, has owned 20 per cent of Sunderland since the summer of 2018 but has largely been an enigmatic figure.\nAdvertisement\nSartori initially revelled in the experience of joining Sunderland\u2019s apparent revival in League One. He regularly sat among supporters with owner Stewart Donald, even wearing a microphone to capture the atmosphere for the Netflix documentary series Sunderland \u2018Til I Die during an away game at Charlton Athletic in January 2019.\nHe was also the beaming board member happily posing for selfies and hoisted in the air as supporters partied in Trafalgar Square on the eve of the EFL Trophy final loss to Portsmouth at Wembley in March 2019.\nBy the end of that season, when Sunderland also lost the League One play-off final to Charlton, Sartori had purposefully become a more distant presence. Political ambitions at home in Uruguay were calling.\nA background in business and a move into politics with the right-leaning National Party brought comparisons to Donald Trump and, like the outgoing US President, there was a defeat at the polls.\nLuis Lacalle Pou comfortably won the race to become the National Party\u2019s candidate for last year\u2019s general election ahead of Sartori and was subsequently voted in as Uruguay\u2019s president. Sartori instead became a senator in the environment commission this past February.\nSartori was often touted as the man to increase his investment in Sunderland by Donald but his political ambitions in Uruguay have demanded another figure joins him in taking control at the Stadium of Light. Louis-Dreyfus, a figure well-known to Sartori, is now positioning himself to become that new force.\nThe Leeds campus of RIASA (the Richmond International Academic & Soccer Academy), 2017.\nThe new intake is usually mainly American and sometimes there are boys from glitzy Hollywood families who have enrolled on a course that covers the football industry from playing to coaching to history and administration. In 2017, two teenagers from France enrolled, one was named Philippe and the other Kyril. The latter is Kyril Louis-Dreyfus.\nAdvertisement\nStudents on the RIASA course at Leeds Beckett University live in halls of residence on the campus in the Headingley district of the city. They learn and train there and RIASA has teams playing in the local leagues and also arranges higher-profile friendlies against EFL clubs such as Bradford City and Sheffield Wednesday. Some players advance from there into professional football, such as Bristol City striker Nahki Wells and Colorado Rapids\u2019 US international forward Jonathan Lewis.\nOthers, though, concentrate on the academic side and play recreationally. They take up different roles, such as Matt Reda, who is now in charge of corporate development at the lower-divisions United Soccer League in Florida. Kyril Louis-Dreyfus was one of these.\n\u201cHe worked hard, played in central midfield, tidy on the ball,\u201d remembers Rob Jones, the former Hibernian, Grimsby Town and Doncaster defender who was the lead coach on the course at the time.\n\u201cKyril was never going to reach a professional level but he knew that \u2014 he was mature in that sense. He\u2019s a lovely guy. I think he\u2019d just come out of military school in France and joined RIASA. He was doing his degree in the football industry. We had him for a year, a lovely guy, down to earth, loves his football. It\u2019s a big passion for him. You can see his background with Marseille and his father and family.\n\u201cHe was very knowledgeable about football, about individuals \u2014 just passionate about the game, really. It was nice to see. He was doing sport and business and management, it was all together.\n\u201cKyril listened, and he was always asking questions about formations and styles. There was an interest there. He was asking about coaching sessions, strength and conditioning sessions, how things fit together on and off the pitch. His interest was the all-encompassing football world.\n\u201cHe was in Leeds for a year and then he moved down to the campus in Richmond in London to finish off the academic side.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nAlthough he did not socialise a lot with the other students, Louis-Dreyfus mixed easily within his peer group. He advertised neither his status nor his wealth, but among the students, there was talk of him taking a private jet from Leeds-Bradford airport back to Switzerland on weekends. Gradually, those on the course and those who ran it understood what the Louis-Dreyfus name meant.\n\u201cWe became aware as he progressed,\u201d Jones says. \u201cIt was not something that he made known, he kept it quiet. He just wanted to fit in and his degree was his priority.\n\u201cHe was very driven, knew what he wanted to do. Routine-wise, he very good, very set, focused on the academic side. He didn\u2019t socialise too much, he had a good buddy with him from France also on the course, Philippe. A lot of the time Kyril was back and forth to home.\u201d\nLouis-Dreyfus did not complete the full four-year degree course, RIASA says. He did two years of it but it was another sign that he was thinking about football as part of his future.\n\u201cIt was a shock to see (Louis-Dreyfus linked with Sunderland) at first,\u201d says Jones, now coaching down the road at Middlesbrough\u2019s academy. \u201cBut then you think about him and it\u2019s not a surprise if he goes down that route. He was very interested in football as a whole, the off-field as much as what\u2019s on it. And he has a background in that environment.\n\u201cObviously he\u2019s an unknown entity in the football world \u2014 so far \u2014 but then there are a lot of unknown entities buying football clubs across the world. You would take it as a positive that the young man wants to invest in Sunderland. He\u2019s a forward-thinker.\u201d\nBack in Sunderland, there is still a wariness.\nThe proposed retention of Donald, albeit as a minority shareholder, has left the club\u2019s followers asking questions. A survey conducted by fan-group Red And White Army in July revealed 90 per cent of supporters wanted the current regime to sell up and Donald told BBC Radio Newcastle in the summer he was \u201cdesperately trying to get out\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nIt has become a marriage all parties want annulled. Donald has steadfastly sought a precise asking price of \u00a337.6 million before he walks away, with a financial picture complicated by a \u00a39 million loan taken out from US investors FPP.\nDefaulting on repayments would hand control of Sunderland to FPP, a company established by three American billionaires, Glenn Fuhrman, John Phelan and Robert Platek, who have links to computer mogul Michael Dell. The loan, taken out last October, was secured against the Stadium of Light and Academy of Light, and any sale of shares in Sunderland would require either approval from FPP or the loan to be paid back in full.\nDonald has effectively spent most of his two and a half years in charge of Sunderland either seeking fresh investment or a new buyer. Failure to win promotion back to the Championship at the first attempt eroded his bargaining power and popularity. The appetite for change is now enormous.\nManager Phil Parkinson, a canny operator in these surroundings, might well do enough to take Sunderland up this season but it is a club craving a fresh drive and impetus that only a takeover can bring.\nParkinson said before the Doncaster game that takeover talks were \u201cprogressing\u201d and the next week could turn out to be decisive.\nHaving a new owner who is the same age as the Stadium of Light itself would be unconventional but Louis-Dreyfus is a fascinating figure on the horizon.\n(Top photo: Xavier Laine/Getty Images)"

      "text": "The game was up. The last loose change of extra time had been spent and still nothing could split Sunderland and Coventry City after 210 minutes beset by the angst of a season\u2019s work being placed on the line.\nThe Stadium of Light, fraught and sweaty, braced itself for the penalty shootout to decide who would progress to Wembley and the Championship play-off final. Regis Le Bris, Sunderland\u2019s head coach, had gone as far as drafting his roster of takers and introduced Leo Hjelde for the final minute with one eye on what was to come. \u201cHe was an option, he\u2019s not the worst,\u201d said a smiling Le Bris afterwards, damning the defender with faint praise.\nAdvertisement\nFirst, though, Sunderland\u2019s shot to nothing. One last corner, the game\u2019s 17th.\nEach of the previous 16 had been fruitless, but in came Enzo Le Fee\u2019s right-footed delivery in the 122nd minute and up jumped Dan Ballard, implausibly finding himself unchallenged six yards out. The header was unconventional, stooping and scruffy. But deflecting in off the underside of the bar, it triggered an explosion to wake the dead as a topless Ballard soon found himself buried beneath the bodies of team-mates.\nSunderland are on their way to Wembley!! \ud83e\udd29 pic.twitter.com/MVsVLxiIco\n\u2014 Sky Sports Football (@SkyFootball) May 13, 2025\nThe Stadium of Light has stood since 1997, but it has never known chaos like it.\nIts very first play-off fixture in 1998 \u2014 a 2-0 win over Sheffield United, the opponent that stands between Sunderland and the Premier League \u2014 has always been used as the atmospheric yardstick, but one of that night\u2019s goalscorers, Kevin Phillips, accepted a new zenith might have been reached 27 years on. \u201cTonight probably topped it,\u201d said the club\u2019s former favourite in his role as a Sky Sports summariser.\nSunderland, in that instant, were a club wide awake to the possibilities of how their season might end and where futures might lie. They have not been in the Premier League since 2016-17 and those wilderness years included the ignominy of four seasons in League One.\nThe revival now asks for one more step. Sunderland had struggled and fought against a Coventry side that had dominated possession across the two legs, but dramatically emerged out the other side to eye Wembley\u2019s arch.\n\u201cTil the End\u201d had been Sunderland\u2019s marketing slogan daubed around the city, and at the point Ballard\u2019s header hit the net, just one second of the two added minutes of extra time remained.\n\u201cFantastic, absolutely fantastic,\u201d Le Bris told reporters shortly before midnight. \u201cYou play football for these emotions.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nA crestfallen Frank Lampard would reluctantly have agreed. \u201cSometimes the gods conspire against you,\u201d said the Coventry head coach. \u201cThat\u2019s football. It\u2019s cruel. We were the better team over two legs.\u201d\nYet on the wrong end of a harsh 3-2 aggregate scoreline. The damage inflicted upon Coventry with a 2-1 win on Friday night proved to be Sunderland\u2019s telling advantage once Ballard had stepped up as his team\u2019s deserving saviour. The central defender, signed from Arsenal three years ago, was imperious across the two legs, with a total of 33 clearances made to repel Coventry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s what dreams are made of,\u201d Ballard told Sky Sports on the pitch. \u201cIt\u2019s some feeling.\u201d\nIf Sheffield United\u2019s 6-0 aggregate win over Bristol City told of an untroubled passage to Wembley, Sunderland\u2019s tie with Coventry had that unyielding tension that tends to come in the Championship play-offs.\nLe Bris accepted his young team had been troubled by anxiety, even after coming through the more demanding test at the Coventry Building Society Arena on Friday night.\nSunderland\u2019s squad had revived itself from a run of five straight defeats to withstand the majority of what their opponents had to throw their way in the opening leg. That was more a victory for stoicism than style, but that slender 2-1 advantage earned in the Midlands would eventually prove hugely significant.\n\u201cThis was never going to be over and it\u2019s not over, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Lampard, who had turned around a first-leg deficit as Derby County manager to beat Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s Leeds United in the 2019 Championship play-offs. \u201cSunderland know that. There\u2019s pressure on us both now in different ways.\u201d\nLampard had spent time weighing up how his opponents might approach the return leg on home soil, but Le Bris\u2019 refusal to shift from a plan that delivered initial success was almost Sunderland\u2019s undoing. A rudimentary approach was focused more on protecting than extending a lead. There was no finesse or flair, and Coventry, who finished the regular season with a wet sail while the team above them floundered, were only too willing to take the game to Sunderland.\nAdvertisement\nCoventry had almost two-thirds possession in normal time, down on the 74 per cent of the first leg, but were again allowed to dominate the ball. Sunderland\u2019s defending was deep and, at times, desperate, and in the 76th minute came the inevitable, the moment the home team had spent the night inviting.\nCoventry, always moving Sunderland around, engineered space to cross from the right and Milan van Ewijk, who had gifted Eliezer Mayenda his late winner four nights earlier, centred for Ephron Mason-Clark to finish low into the corner.\nSunderland\u2019s Class of 2024-25, though, has fortitude built in. They were sloppy and loose, too often hurried into hopeful long balls, but they clung on doggedly until Ballard\u2019s big moment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to highlight the character of this squad,\u201d said Le Bris, whose only previous trip to Wembley was to watch an England international fixture.\n\u201cThey are not always brilliant with the ball, but they represent well the region, the club and the way you have to play to win. It\u2019s more about mentality and character. When it\u2019s tough, they are so strong. They never gave up.\u201d\nLe Bris stressed that the season cannot be solely defined by what awaits on May 24, talking instead of the club\u2019s wider journey. That has been an eight-year one beneath the Premier League to this point, with the second half of that building a confident young squad of assets, such as Jobe Bellingham, Chris Rigg, Dennis Cirkin and Mayenda under the watch of 27-year-old owner Kyril Louis-Dreyfus.\nThe plan has been astute and, next to the river where they used to build the boats, there is a rising tide. \u201cIt\u2019s about shared energy and connections together,\u201d said Le Bris. \u201cThe question now is if we can win the last game.\u201d\nThe answer will come in 10 days.\n(Top photo: Ballard\u2019s winner sparked unprecedented scenes at the Stadium of Light; by Robbie Jay Barratt \u2013 AMA/Getty Images))"

      "text": "It is a couple of months after earning promotion. In the north east of England, Sunderland are causing a stir. Before a return to top-flight football, they have spent big. The year is 2007.\nIt is easily forgotten now, but Sunderland\u2019s last promotion before this one brought with it a glut of transfers. Sunderland spent \u00a335million on new faces that summer, the fifth-highest total in the Premier League, only trailing Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City and Liverpool.\nAdvertisement\nIt seems an almost quaint figure now. To sign 21-year-old midfielder Habib Diarra this summer, Sunderland are handing over \u00a327m ($36m). Simon Adingra, Chemsdine Talbi, Enzo Le Fee, and Noah Sadiki have all arrived for between \u00a314m and \u00a318m, before any future add-ons. As revealed by The Athletic on Wednesday, goalkeeper Robin Roefs is set to join for \u00a39m, taking Sunderland\u2019s combined transfer spend beyond the \u00a3100m mark.\nThe figure has increased following confirmation of Granit Xhaka\u2019s arrival on Wearside. Xhaka has returned to England for an initial fee of \u00a313m, fresh from a successful stint at Bayer Leverkusen.\nSunderland, just like they did all those years ago, are spending heavily in an attempt to ensure they last longer than a single season in the Premier League.\nThe club\u2019s transfer business has raised eyebrows. Sunderland\u2019s promotion team comprised a mix of academy graduates and low-cost acquisitions \u2014 the starting XI for May\u2019s play-off final victory against Sheffield United required less than \u00a310m to assemble.\nTwo months on, Sunderland now have the most expensive squad in the club\u2019s history. Xhaka is the club\u2019s seventh signing in a month. Add Roefs and some assumed agent fees and transfer levies, and we land at a gross spend this summer of \u00a3130m.\nSunderland are the seventh-highest-spending Premier League club this window, only trailing the traditional \u2018Big Six\u2019. On a net basis, including the Roefs deal, they\u2019re this summer\u2019s eighth-highest-spending club in the world.\nSunderland generated significant sales in their most recent financial year but even so, the way they have cleared club spending records is eye-catching. After accounting for sales, alongside fees spent on Wilson Isidor, Milan Aleksic and Ahmed Abdullahi since the start of their financial year last July, The Athletic estimates Sunderland\u2019s net transfer spend to be around \u00a394m.\nAdvertisement\nThe spending won\u2019t stop there. New faces have primarily arrived in midfield \u2014 none of them play in central defence or up front, two positions that need strengthening. Further signings are expected before the season opener against West Ham United on August 16.\nSunderland\u2019s outlay is reflective of plenty of things, but at least two obvious ones. First, the money involved in English football has never been greater; the figures clubs must reach to remain competitive grow each year.\nSecond, Sunderland have a lot of ground to make up. Spending on transfer fees is only weakly correlated with immediate success but, as The Athletic detailed recently, sustained spending over time tends to prove rewarding on the field.\nSeventeen of this year\u2019s Premier League clubs were in the division last year (and the year before that), and their squads have been built up accordingly. Burnley are back in the top flight after just one year away. Leeds United spent two years out of it. Sunderland last played in the Premier League in 2017.\nOver a year has passed since the most recently available figures, but even taking squad cost values from the end of the 2023-24 season shows the increasing size of the gulf.\nSunderland\u2019s \u00a318.4m was around 80 times lower than league-leading Chelsea and, even more strikingly, it was only a 10th of the cost at which Burnley\u2019s squad had been assembled. Sunderland\u2019s transfer spending has paled in comparison to those they\u2019ll face this season. In 2023-24 figures, they were only middling in the Championship.\nIn each of the past two seasons, all three promoted sides have been swiftly relegated. There are other reasons besides money for that, but it is impossible to deny that wealth, or a relative lack of it, is increasingly playing a part.\nOn transfer fees alone, Sunderland have spent \u00a3113.6m on new players. That makes them one of only six clubs to spend over \u00a3100m in the summer following promotion, and the three who spent more than them \u2014 Nottingham Forest in 2022 (\u00a3140.4m), Aston Villa in 2019 (\u00a3134m) and Leeds (\u00a3115.2m in 2020) \u2014 all survived relegation.\nIpswich spent over \u00a3100m and Southampton just under it last summer. Both went down meekly. But when money casts such a large shadow over on-field fortunes, it stands to reason that big spending will improve a survival bid\u2019s chances.\nIn the past seven seasons, only three promoted clubs have spent less than \u00a350m in their summer window and stayed up. Bournemouth later invested heavily in January, helping them finish 15th. Sheffield United stayed up in 2019-20 but have since been relegated (twice). Meanwhile, Brentford, ever the outlier, have long been marked out as one of the savviest clubs in England. It\u2019s possible to stay up without spending a fortune, but you\u2019ll give yourself a better chance if you do.\nSunderland\u2019s spending might yet catch Forest\u2019s \u00a3140m promoted-side record, and mentions of their spending a couple of years ago immediately draw thoughts in the direction of what came next: a points deduction for breaching the Premier League\u2019s profit and sustainability rules (PSR).\nYet there\u2019s a key difference. Forest\u2019s arrival in the Premier League came on the back of 14 years in the Championship, football\u2019s equivalent of a financial black hole. Almost without exception, the longer a club stays in England\u2019s second tier, the more money they lose. In Forest\u2019s case, that amounted to pre-tax losses of \u00a3185m \u2014 \u00a362m of those arrived during their final two seasons in the division. This meant they entered the Premier League carrying heavy existing losses on their rolling three-year PSR calculation.\nAdvertisement\nSunderland, though, were only in the Championship for three seasons before winning promotion, and spent four years of their Premier League exile in League One. They still lost money, carrying infrastructure and running costs far too large for a third-division side, but in some ways, those seasons allowed for a reset.\nMajority shareholder Kyril Louis-Dreyfus inherited a near-blank slate when he took over in 2021. Sunderland still lost money, but it wasn\u2019t anywhere near as much as would have been lost had they been carrying a Championship wage bill for years.\nThose losses amounted to \u00a317.5m between 2022 and 2024. Seven Championship clubs lost more than that in 2023-24 alone.\nSunderland can add back what the authorities deem \u2018good\u2019 costs in their PSR calculation. In their case, having a Category One academy means those add-backs are sizeable. Exact figures are unknown, but The Athletic estimates Sunderland\u2019s PSR result in their first two Championship seasons was profitable.\nEverything points to another profitable PSR year in 2024-25. Sunderland might even have made a pre-tax profit for the first time in 19 years. Through the sales of Jobe Bellingham, Jack Clarke and Tommy Watson, they\u2019ve generated over \u00a340m in player profits, to go alongside a much-improved commercial offering and higher attendances than a year ago (as well as higher ticket prices).\nSunderland\u2019s operating loss (pre-player sales) was \u00a316.9m in 2023-24, and there have been various investment programmes undertaken across the club since then. Wages, inevitably, will have risen, and 2024-25 will also bear whatever bonuses fell due as a result of promotion. Yet those player profits are hefty. Sunderland might have been profitable last season, or at the very least hovering near break-even.\nMoving into 2025-26, Sunderland and their fellow promoted clubs have lower loss limits than the rest of the division, and the club don\u2019t appear to have received \u2018secure funding\u2019 from the owners, limiting them to three-year losses of \u00a315m. But entering the Premier League from a position of profitability stands them in better stead than most others have managed in recent years \u2014 including Leeds and Burnley this time around.\nAdvertisement\nHardly any of Sunderland\u2019s spending this summer fell into their 2024-25 accounting period (we estimate less than \u00a32m), though the same isn\u2019t true going forward. Of the \u00a3130m gross spend, The Athletic projects \u00a329m a year will hit Sunderland\u2019s books as amortisation costs over the next three seasons, before \u00a324m in 2028-29 and \u00a318m in 2029-30. In comparison, the club\u2019s 2023-24 amortisation bill was just \u00a34m.\nThat\u2019s without even mentioning wages. Those are unknown, but expensive signings rarely come on low salaries. Existing players are likely to have received promotion wage rises too, which means further expense. There are also around \u00a322m in potential add-ons.\nSunderland\u2019s total future costs across fees and wages may have increased by a quarter-billion pounds.\nIf that sounds like a scary number, then it needs to be viewed alongside the opposing half of the ledger. In broadcast revenue alone, Sunderland will see a \u00a3100m increase in turnover this season. Premier League status affords the ability to earn more in other revenue streams, too. By our estimate, Sunderland\u2019s transfer activity might have added \u00a360m in annual costs over the next couple of seasons, which is still well below the revenue uptick they\u2019ll enjoy this season.\nIt also feels like a necessity. Just as transfer fees rise, so have wages, increasing the cost of Premier League survival. Across the last three seasons, when wage data is available, seven Premier League clubs paid less than \u00a3100m in annual salaries. Five were relegated, with only (you guessed it) Brentford the nonconformists both times. Nine-figure wage bills are increasingly important to stay in the Premier League, but Sunderland\u2019s most recent wage bill was \u00a331.4m.\nSunderland sources, kept anonymous to protect relationships, expect sales will follow. Whether Sunderland have purposely waited until a new accounting period to move out some players is unknown \u2014 with Watson and Bellingham, waiting wasn\u2019t an option \u2014 but it would make financial sense. With no compliance issues in 2024-25, sales from August onwards will hit the 2025-26 books, staying on the three-year rolling PSR calculation until the end of the 2027-28 season. The club have committed to significant future costs, so anything to offset those will be welcome.\nThis summer has seen Sunderland ramp up their level of spending, but they\u2019ve also largely continued the policy that got them promoted, with sporting director Kristjaan Speakman and head of player recruitment Stuart Harvey dramatically reducing the average age of the squad.\nAdvertisement\nSince the summer of 2021, including Xhaka and Roefs, 62 players have been signed. Of those, 45 were under 24 years old.\nThis summer, Adingra (23), Roefs (22), Diarra (21), Sadiki and Talbi (both 20) are continuing that trend. Le Fee joined on loan in January, turned 25 in February and saw his deal become permanent the moment the final whistle blew at Wembley \u2014 the first time Sunderland have spent a fee on anyone aged older than 24 since embarking upon this new strategy.\nXhaka\u2019s signing is the second instance and the former Arsenal captain represents a clear departure from recent recruitment strategy. In spending \u00a313m on the Switzerland international, which could rise to \u00a317.3m in future add-ons are triggered, Sunderland have, for the first time under Louis-Dreyfus and company, spent a fee on a player without any clear intention of making their money back via that player\u2019s future sale. Xhaka will be almost 36 by the time his three-year contract comes to a close.\nSunderland have signed older heads over the past few years but all of them have been for nothing in fees. Reinildo Mandava, the 31-year-old Mozambique international left-back who signed when his Atletico Madrid contract expired at the end of June, continued that theme.\nXhaka\u2019s signing has bucked it, though it\u2019s easy to see why. He brings much-needed experience to a squad that, even with the addition of Adingra, had just 45 full Premier League games played across it \u2014 37 of them by Adingra.\nIf they survive relegation, Xhaka\u2019s \u00a313m fee will seem a small price to pay in exchange for another year or more of Premier League riches. If they finish in the bottom three, the Xhaka signing will be viewed as a punt that didn\u2019t pay off.\nWhatever they do this summer, first-time relegation will remain a possibility, and more likely a probability. Where Xhaka and Reinildo have joined on three- and two-year deals, the rest of this summer\u2019s cohort have signed up to longer-term contracts. Whichever division Sunderland occupy in a year, they\u2019ll own young players with several years left on their contracts who, theoretically, still aren\u2019t at their peak.\nAdvertisement\nThat can be viewed in one of two ways. In the negative scenario, this summer\u2019s signings are flops and a relegated Sunderland are left with several expensive players they either can\u2019t shift or need to accept a loss on.\nAlternatively, even after relegation, they\u2019ll possess assets who can be sold to mitigate the impact of the drop. Resale value has been a key tenet of the club\u2019s transfer policy under Speakman and Harvey, and remains so even now that spending has increased.\nSunderland have proven adept at understanding the transfer market in recent years, selling players at significant profits. Bellingham\u2019s June move to Borussia Dortmund is the latest such example. Even with the sell-on due to Birmingham City, his move should lead to a \u00a320m profit.\nThere\u2019s wider evidence that shows relegated clubs have successfully generated big money from selling their better players. Across the 12 teams relegated between 2020 and 2023, after adjusting for Burnley\u2019s later accounting date, \u00a3716m was earned from player sales in the season following demotion \u2014 an average of \u00a360m per team. In 2023-24, Southampton, Leeds United and Leicester City generated \u00a3295m in sales between them. Last year, Burnley banked around \u00a396m from post-relegation departures.\nNaturally, Sunderland believe the players they have signed are capable of performing in the Premier League. Should that prove insufficient to secure survival, they\u2019ll trust their ability to move still-young players on without too much of a hit, ensuring those hefty future costs committed to this summer don\u2019t actually materialise. The risk is they\u2019ve bought poorly, but that\u2019s true of any transfer.\nSunderland followed the expensive summer of 18 years ago with more spending in January. One point above the relegation zone at the turn of the year, a further \u00a38m went on reinforcements. It proved worth it. Roy Keane\u2019s men survived, and Sunderland would stay in the Premier League for another nine years.\nLast weekend, coincidentally, threw up another callback. Sunderland travelled north of the border to Hearts and a testimonial for Craig Gordon, who broke the British transfer record for a goalkeeper when they paid Hearts \u00a39million to sign him in 2007. They lost 3-0 but, perversely, it might not have been the worst thing.\nAdvertisement\nAmid the excitement that has flowed since the play-off triumph two months ago, a torrent of good feeling that Xhaka\u2019s arrival has only bolstered, it is easy to forget the task that stands before Le Bris and his side. The gap between England\u2019s top two divisions, in many respects, has never been greater.\nSunderland aim to bridge it by spending big, something they can do \u2014 and, everything indicates, will continue to do \u2014 albeit while trying to remain true to the strategy that got them here in the first place. It might not work. But they certainly can\u2019t be accused of not giving it a go.\n(Top photos: Getty Images)"

      "text": "It is in the closing scenes of Sunderland \u2018Til I Die when supporter Michelle Barraclough delivers that heart-rending line to distil the enduring appeal of the Netflix documentary.\n\u201cWhy is it never us celebrating?\u201d she asks in the aftermath of a stoppage-time defeat to Charlton Athletic in the 2019 League One play-off final at Wembley. \u201cWhy is it never us?\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHer question is not looking for an answer, but the suffering is wholly authentic and raw. Almost uncomfortably so.\n\u201cA right water bag,\u201d says Barraclough now in a blunt, retrospective self-appraisal. \u201cWe\u2019ve had opposition fans singing \u2018We saw you crying on Netflix\u2019 since then and there\u2019s not a lot I can say to that, is there?\u201d\nGuilty as charged, but a smiling Barraclough has no wish to change her role in the docu-series that first aired five years ago today. She was among a handful of fans who added depth to the story of Sunderland\u2019s decline, illustrating the human cost of a football club living through its nadir.\n\u201cIt showed the passion that people in the North East have for football,\u201d she says. \u201cYou saw what it meant to so many people. That\u2019s what made it special.\u201d\nAnd viewers are now going to see more of it. Limited to three episodes rather than the eight and six of series one and two respectively, Sunderland \u2018Til I Die is due to return to Netflix in the new year.\nSunderland\u2019s play-off final win over Wycombe Wanderers in May 2022, which sealed promotion back to the Championship under Alex Neil, will be the central thread and some protagonists, including Barraclough, will return.\nSo will Peter Farrer, the straight-talking, spirited taxi driver of the first two series. He has embraced retirement in the past two years but remains a recognisable face to strangers at the Stadium of Light.\n\u201cIt was popular because it was about the city and it was about the people,\u201d says Farrer. \u201cAnd the city loves the football club. Just a genuine thing, even when they\u2019re at rock bottom.\u201d\nThat is exactly where Sunderland found themselves when a Netflix audience was last asked to pity them. A humbling relegation from the Championship was confirmed at the end of series one before promise ultimately went unfulfilled in series two. That failure to win promotion out of League One at the first attempt under Jack Ross amounted to what was the lowest standing in the club\u2019s history.\nAdvertisement\nAnd it got worse once the cameras stopped rolling. The 2019-20 season, curtailed by the Covid-19 pandemic, brought an eighth-place finish in League One under Phil Parkinson before the next campaign ended with another play-off defeat under Lee Johnson, beaten by Lincoln City over two legs.\nOnly when Stewart Donald, the enthusiastic but hapless owner who was followed in series two, ceded control to Kyril Louis-Dreyfus, the Swiss heir to a billionaire\u2019s fortune, did Sunderland\u2019s stagnation turn to progress and, by May 2022, there was cause for the Netflix cameras to return in search of their happy ending.\n\u201cIt was such a fabulous feeling when it finally was us,\u201d says Barraclough at her home in the Silksworth area of Sunderland. \u201cI was probably in tears again. Happy tears, at least.\u201d\nSunderland \u2018Til I Die was always pitched as being different to the modern football documentaries when first aired in December 2018. It was the antithesis of Amazon Prime\u2019s All or Nothing, a polished product that has featured the likes of Manchester City, Juventus, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal.\nIts creators, production company Fulwell73, include lifelong Sunderland fans Ben Turner and Leo Pearlman, who joined the club\u2019s board of directors in October of this year. The focus purposely went beyond the struggles of a beleaguered club and out towards its community. The power was in its people.\n\u201cUnlike some football documentaries, it didn\u2019t just focus on the inner workings of a club, the players and the manager, like a fly on the wall thing,\u201d says Andrew Cammiss, the former serviceman and family man who was filmed spray painting his beard red and white for a Wembley trip in series two.\n\u201cThis area is massively passionate about football and the club is a major part of the city. The fact they went out and found fans to tell their stories made it different. Unlike the players, we don\u2019t move on. We stay and support to the bitter end. That\u2019s why it had so much raw emotion in there.\u201d\nThe only constant across the two series of Sunderland \u2018Til I Die became the fans and it was that charm that helped convince Rob McElhenney to buy Wrexham along with Ryan Reynolds three years ago. \u201cI was falling in love with this team and these people and the story,\u201d said McElhenney in 2021 after binging the two series during lockdown.\nAdvertisement\nHe was not the only one sucked in. \u201cSunderland\u2019s become known around the world on the back of it,\u201d says Farrer. \u201cI\u2019m not blowing my own trumpet, but I can go into the Colliery Tavern (the closest pub to the Stadium of Light) before a game and somebody will recognise me. I\u2019ve had people from Slovakia, America, Chile, Germany, France come up to me.\n\u201cI used to pick up a fare in the taxi and you\u2019d have people in the back nudging each other saying, \u2018It\u2019s him off Sunderland \u2018Til I Die\u2019. I know Prince William\u2019s watched it as well. One of the local councillors came round here (close to Farrer\u2019s home in Hendon) and was saying when he\u2019d spoken with Prince William he\u2019d told him he\u2019d watched it. You couldn\u2019t make it up.\u201d\nGO DEEPER\nSolvent? Clever? Ambitious? Realistic? How are Sunderland viewed by managerial contenders?\nFarrer has a video message on his phone to illustrate the reach of Sunderland \u2018Til I Die. \u201cThe strangest one came after the end of the first series,\u201d he says. \u201cMy son is Peter Farrer and he\u2019s on Facebook, which I don\u2019t bother with. He says to me he\u2019s had a message off a bloke from River Plate and I\u2019m like, \u2018F*** off, man!\u2019. He thought my son was me and he wanted to speak to me about Sunderland.\n\u201cHe\u2019d totally fallen in love with Sunderland and he sent me a video telling me how popular I was in Argentina. They\u2019d loved the series and invited me over to see the stadium and the club.\u201d\nThe video, filmed at the Estadio Monumental with the 2018 Copa Libertadores trophy in the background, still makes Farrer chuckle. Only the Covid-19 pandemic and prostate cancer put a stop to his travel plans. \u201cI\u2019ve had it all removed,\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019m champion now.\u201d\nBarraclough also finds her days interrupted by those eager to talk Sunderland. \u201cIt was wonderful to be part of it,\u201d she says. \u201cI still get recognised at games. It was part of our matchday experience in the end. We\u2019d meet up with the crew and they\u2019d follow us through matches. They\u2019d mic us up and you\u2019d eventually forget you were wearing it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably what made it popular. It\u2019s authentic and, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I don\u2019t think anyone hates us. Except for them (Newcastle) up the road. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re a club that anyone really dislikes and a lot of the time we\u2019re underdogs. I think the North East people are pretty wonderful, too.\u201d\nSunderland \u2018Til I Die was warts and all. The aimless leadership of former chief executive Martin Bain was laid bare, as was the desperation of a deadline-day bid for Will Grigg. Then there were those awkward moments that tracked Charlie Methven, the former director who introduced dance music to the Stadium of Light in an attempt to make it \u201ca bit Ibiza\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nSunderland was a club of good intentions but was fatally undermined by an instability that brought false dawns.\nNot so much anymore. Donald and Methven checked out of Wearside long ago and Louis-Dreyfus, a 26-year-old withdrawn public figure, has a five-year plan to take Sunderland back to the Premier League by 2026.\nPromotion out of League One came at the end of his first full season with a controlling stake before last term ended with a sixth-place finish in the Championship. Only defeat to Luton Town across two legs denied Sunderland another trip back to Wembley.\n\u201cThe club\u2019s in a good place now,\u201d says Barraclough. \u201cI\u2019ve met Kyril and I really like him. A very astute young man who\u2019s got his head screwed on. He knows exactly what he wants.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very different club now, for the better. We\u2019ve got better owners and we\u2019ve got more people in the club who are Sunderland fans. We\u2019ve got an owner who, hopefully, has learned from the mistakes of our previous owners.\n\u201cIn the past, we spent a fortune on players thinking it would be an easy fix, but we bought a lot of journeymen who were only here for the money. They didn\u2019t have the heart or the motivation that these young lads are showing now.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now trying to build for the future, but the difficulty is trying to stay patient. We might lose games, but these are young kids who give everything now and they\u2019ll get better with experience.\u201d\nThis season, though, there has already been turbulence that fans had hoped to leave behind. Tony Mowbray was sacked last week after a run of two wins in nine games, a call made all the more ruthless after last season concluded with an injury-hit team defying the odds.\n\u201cI loved Mowbray, the best football we\u2019ve seen since Peter Reid,\u201d says Cammiss. \u201cI was distraught with the way he\u2019s been treated. He was sacked when we\u2019re three points off the play-offs. A rash decision and, for me, not the right one.\u201d\nCammiss is torn on the direction of travel for Sunderland. \u201cThey\u2019ve got this plan in place now where they\u2019ll sign young players for very little money and sell them on for a lot of money. Have I enjoyed the young players coming in and watching them flourish? Of course.\n\u201cBut my opinion on the owner is that he\u2019s very clever for a young man. He\u2019s got this model in place because he\u2019s here, like a lot of foreign owners, to make money by taking a club to the promised land.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nFarrer is more understanding of Mowbray\u2019s dismissal, believing it a pity but inevitable for a manager growing irritable with his employers. \u201cThe club is in a place the club wants it to be in for now,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that sounds daft, but it\u2019s about that next step up. It\u2019s a massive gulf between the Championship and the Premier League.\n\u201cJust look at the teams that went up last season. If we were to go up, we\u2019d have to buy five or six experienced players and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what they want to do. But do you want to get promoted? Of course you do for the money side, but those three clubs that went up tell you it isn\u2019t much fun when you get there.\u201d\nFarrer, a supporter for over half a century, does not find much to relish in an FA Cup third-round date with Newcastle United either. The first meaningful meeting between the local rivals in almost eight years, scheduled for January 6, has the potential to highlight an uncomfortable gulf that has widened since Newcastle\u2019s Saudi takeover.\n\u201cI suppose we\u2019ve nothing to lose,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we get beat, we get beat. If we win, then brilliant. But it\u2019s not the draw I wanted, I\u2019ll tell you that. You can\u2019t enjoy those games.\u201d\nSunderland \u2018Til I Die will return next year to show a club back on an upward trajectory, but the past 12 months have brought a loss that will form part of the final chapters.\nIan Wake was Barraclough\u2019s long-standing companion at Sunderland fixtures, the towering presence next to her when she is filmed crying at Wembley. Wake was also the fan who had the Sunderland \u2018Til I Die logo tattooed on the inside of his arm ahead of the defeat to Portsmouth in the 2019 Checkatrade Trophy final, another scene captured by Netflix cameras.\nThis year brought Wake\u2019s unexpected death in March and his funeral is set to be featured in an episode where producers have sought the approval of Barraclough. \u201cIt\u2019s been so sad, so emotional,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was 62, so he should\u2019ve really had another 20 years ahead of him. What they\u2019ve done is a beautiful tribute to Ian. Sunderland \u2019til he died.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWake passed in the closing weeks of last season when Sunderland\u2019s late charge into the Championship play-offs brought more pain with the loss to Luton. Although the third series will relive the League One semi-final win over Sheffield Wednesday and then a cathartic victory over Wycombe in the final at Wembley during the 2021-22 season, it is now three seasons out of five that have concluded with Sunderland beaten in the play-offs.\nA place in the Championship play-offs is already the summit of Sunderland\u2019s ambitions after seeing the current top two of Leicester City and Ipswich Town disappear over the horizon, and there is a sense that the division\u2019s youngest squad will eventually not have enough. Sunderland are sixth after Tuesday\u2019s impressive 1-0 win over Leeds United, the same position they ended last season.\n\u201cI\u2019d love it to happen, but I just can\u2019t see it,\u201d says Barraclough. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ve had the optimism knocked out me. I\u2019m more of a realist and I look at the other clubs in the league. The only route left is through the play-offs and I\u2019m not sure I could bear another one of them\u2026\u201d\nGO DEEPER\nMowbray sacking was no surprise - Sunderland's 'strategic model' was always an uneasy fit\n(Top photo: George Wood via Getty Images)"
