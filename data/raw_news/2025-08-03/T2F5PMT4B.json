  "description": "Bosch's first-ever air fryer proves why it's a household name in\u2026 well\u2026 household appliances.",
  "content": "The Bosch Series 6 is an excellent, affordable air fryer that doesn't require preheating and is surprisingly compact given its 7.2L capacity. Perfect for smaller households or those who want to focus on cooking one food type at a time, this appliance offers high-quality cooking across its eight programs, while a handful of quality-of-life features make it a joy to cook with. It could, however, benefit from being quieter and from tweaks to its accompanying grill rack.\n\nWhy you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test.\n\nGerman manufacturer Bosch has been a long-standing name in home appliances since it released its first refrigerator back in 1933. So, it's no surprise that the company finally took the plunge into the lucrative air fryer market with the release of the Bosch Series 6 Air Fryer.\n\nYou'd perhaps forgive Bosch for having some teething issues with its first-ever air, but the Series 6 has very few. Instead of prioritizing a surplus of extra cooking programs, modes, and features, the Series 6 offers a more streamlined experience, focusing on the quality of life features and cooking programs the average user needs rather than unnecessary add-ons.\n\nThere are eight cooking programs, which cover the most typical food types cooked in an air fryer: Keep Warm, French Fries, Poultry, Meat, Fish, Vegetables, Bread, and Small Pastries (because who doesn't love an air-fried croissant?) We found each program to cook food consistently well, though some tweaking may be required for taste, especially when it comes to meats.\n\nThese programs are straightforward to use thanks to the air fryer's clear touch controls, while a handful of quality-of-life features make the Series 6 a joy to use. Its illuminated drawer and window allow you to check food without letting out heat, its Shake alert lets out clear, loud chirps, and its included grill rack and skewers allow you to grill food with ease. It's also generally easy to clean with minimal elbow grease and fairly compact given its 7.2-liter capacity.\n\nWhile the Series 6 is a great appliance overall, it's not perfect. It's one of the louder air fryers this reviewer has tested (hitting 68dB in some cases), and removing the aforementioned metal grill rack and skewers from the basket safely can prove a bit of a struggle. We'd also have loved for the aforementioned grill rack to be securable within the basket to prevent rubbing on the non-stick plate. We also found that it struggled to balance keeping chicken moist inside while crispy outside.\n\nThese are minor issues, however, and the Bosch Series 6 Air Fryer provides an excellent experience otherwise. Though it is perhaps more suited to smaller households or those who only wish to cook one food item at a time.\n\u2022 Available in the UK, but not available in the US and Australia\n\u2022 Regular discounts bring it down to around \u00a3100\n\nThe Bosch Series 6 Air Fryer offers top-tier quality for its budget price tag. At \u00a3159.99 (roughly $212.58 / AU$329.16), it costs \u00a340 less than our current best budget air fryer, the Russell Hobbs Satisfry Dual Basket Air Fryer (though it offers less capacity), and is considerably more affordable than premium options, such as the Ninja Double Oven and Dreo ChefMaker.\n\nUnfortunately, this appliance isn't currently available in the U.S. or Australia, but those in the UK can purchase it from Bosch directly or a range of trusted third-party retailers, such as Argos and Amazon.\n\nIf its current price tag is a little over your budget, don't fret. Regular discounts at Bosch and other retailers see this air fryer's price dropping to around the \u00a3100 mark, saving you nearly \u00a360 on the usual RRP.\n\u2022 Comes with metal grill rack and five skewers\n\nThe Bosch Series 6 offers a 7.2L capacity in a relatively compact design (compared to its competitors). The body of this air fryer is glossy black, with a silver rim around the top, a single drawer basket, and a removable handle. The touchscreen interface is easy to use, with the temperature adjustable in five-degree intervals.\n\nThe drawer is illuminated, meaning a light (which you can turn off and on at the touch of a button) comes on when you remove it, and thanks to an oven-like window, you can easily check your food without stopping the cooking process.\n\nThe included physical user manual is thorough, making it easy to set up and use this appliance \u2013 even if you're a beginner. A physical food guide is also included, which provides a rough cooking guide and tips for each of the air fryer's eight programs. We do wish the food guide were slightly more detailed and included more food types, especially when it comes to cooking vegetables.\n\nThe food guide does come with a QR code, though, that leads you to a Quick Start Guide that features a handful of excellent recipes for this specific air fryer. We just wish there were more of them.\n\nThis air fryer also comes with a metal grill rack accessory and five skewers that fit into the grill rack. These are a welcome addition for grilling, but we found removing the hot grill rack difficult after cooking due to the depth of the basket and its metal design. We also wish the grill rack could be locked into the basket's plate to avoid it moving around and potentially damaging the plate's non-stick coating long-term.\n\nWhile the 7.2L basket is a bit bulky, it's easy to hand wash with minimal elbow grease \u2013 though, inside the window is slightly trickier to reach. Fortunately, the basket and its plate are dishwasher-proof, though we at TechRadar tend to recommend hand washing anything with a non-stick coat.\n\nThe main design drawback of this air fryer is its volume. We logged a max 68dB reading when the appliance was running at its maximum temperature, making it loud enough that we couldn't hear our kitchen TV and could hear it from our living room next door. This is particularly loud for an air fryer (based on those we've tested) and several decibels louder than the 63dB Bosch claims.\n\u2022 Some foods could be crispier\n\nWe found the Bosch Series 6 air fryer performed consistently well across its eight cooking programs: Bread, Fish, French Fries, Keep Warm, Meat, Small Pastries, Poultry, and Vegetables.\n\nWe started our testing with 500g of frozen fries , utilizing the air fryer's French Fries preset, while tweaking the time slightly as recommended by the food guide. After 23 minutes, we had fairly evenly cooked fries (a couple were slightly over for my taste), but overall, the fries were fluffy inside and golden outside.\n\nFollowing the frozen fries, we tried 700g of handmade fries, soaked and with one tablespoon of oil, on the same setting, using the exact preset time and temperature. Again, the fries were fluffy inside and golden outside but could have been a little crispier. Unlike other air fryers, however, the Bosch Series 6 didn't leave our fries with overdone ends \u2013 a common issue we've encountered with testing.\n\nNext, we tested the grill and skewer accessories. We loaded up each of the five skewers with chicken, onion, tomato, and peppers \u2013 but may have overloaded them a little as the five skewers struggled to fit beside each other. My advice: make sure your cuts of veggies and meat are smaller to avoid this.\n\nThe skewers sit on indents in the grill rack, which is placed in the basket. We've mentioned our issues with the grill rack generally, but despite the overcrowding, we found our skewers cooked well on the Poultry preset, though some of the vegetables were becoming overdone and the chicken slightly overdone, so we had to remove them a few minutes early. You likely need to adjust this timing based on what you skewer.\n\nWe also tried cooking a couple of chicken breasts on the grill rack (with some seasoning and a tablespoon of oil) on the Poultry preset. They came out slightly dry and with not quite enough crisp on the outside for our taste, but overall very tasty.\n\nWe had this same crisping issue with drumsticks prepared using a Bosch recipe and dry-rubbed wings (my go-to Cosori recipe), both cooked well and were juicy inside, but the skin didn't crisp up quite enough. The pre-baked petit pains we cooked on the Bread preset, too were soft inside, but not quite crunchy enough outside.\n\nThe Bosch recipes are a great starting point for this air fryer, and we particularly enjoyed its roasted cauliflower and egg omelette muffin recipes (both turned out perfect). The apple turnover recipe, while very tasty, resulted in turnovers with overly soggy bottoms \u2013 though that's likely down to chef error on my part.\n\nOther presets may require some tweaking of the timings. Sausages on the Beef preset were slightly underdone after seven minutes, which may be down to the fact that they were chunky Cumberlands.\n\nVegetables, too, like most air fryers, require some experimentation. The food guide isn't very detailed on how long to cook certain vegetables and just covers \"Grilled Vegetables.\" While this was the perfect preset for my chantanay carrots, my broccoli, onions and peppers needed to be removed early to avoid becoming too charred. Again, this is something we've encountered with several air fryers.\n\nNow, if you've read our air fryer reviews before, you'll know we love an air fryer that can bake. The Bosch Series 6 can manage that feat for small cakes and muffins, so we used our usual Ninja muffin recipe with the Muffin preset to test its capabilities. It was perhaps the best result I've had for this test, with the muffins perfectly golden on top, not too dry inside, and little to no overspill.\n\nOverall, the Bosch Series 6 performs brilliantly; however, you may need to experiment a bit to get the right balance of crispness and doneness for certain foods.\n\nShould you buy the Bosch Series 6 air fryer?\n\nI used the Bosch Series 6 air fryer for a week, cooking a wide variety of foods including fries, sausages, fresh vegetables, and pastries. I tested all the air fryer's various modes and cleaned the air fryer in line with the instructions provided in the manual. For more details, see how we test, rate, and review products at TechRadar.",

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nWhile pricey, the Ninja Double Oven isn\u2019t overpriced. In fact, it\u2019s more than worth it when you consider it has two separate ovens, each with their own set of functions, which can be set to complete cooking at the same time. With air fryer functionality and plenty more besides, the only real complaint is that cleanup afterwards can prove a bit of a chore.\nPros\n- +\nDouble-oven setup is convenience personified\n- +\nSmart Finish makes it easy to synchronize cooking times\n- +\nCooks evenly and timely\nCons\n- -\nPricey and only available in the US at the time of writing\n- -\nCleaning is tough\n- -\nWould have appreciated a second crumb tray\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nTwo-minute review\nThe Ninja Double Oven Air Fryer is a unique entry among the exploding kitchen-scape of these types of cooking appliances. With oven-style air fryers in the minority compared to the cheaper basket-style variety, as far as I can tell, there aren\u2019t any other models that come with two separate cooking compartments. For that, you\u2019ll have to stick to a handful of basket air fryers, including models from Ninja.\nNinja\u2019s product line appears to consist of two oven-style air fryers \u2013 the DCT451 reviewed here and the slightly cheaper (by $20) DCT40. However, they\u2019re actually the same unit, with the more expensive one arriving with a smart thermometer.\nThe rarity of this air fryer\u2019s form factor might not be enough for it to stand among the best air fryers available right now; but, luckily, it performs exactly as it should, leaving little room for concern.\nOutside of its price, which can certainly be considered premium, the only real issue I had with this was that cleaning the inside of the compartments was a little tricky. Basket-style air fryers enable you to remove the entire basket for cleanup; but cleaning an oven-style air fryer such as this one from Ninja is very very much like cleaning the inside of a toaster oven.\nThat said, you can\u2019t cook a pizza, roast a chicken, or toast a number of slices of sourdough all at once in the former. And, with the Ninja Double Oven air fryer, you can engage two different cooking functions at the same time.\nNinja Double Oven review: price and availability\n- List price: $349.99 (about \u00a3274 / AU$532)\n- Available in the US only\nThe Ninja Double Oven is only available Stateside. While Ninja does offer oven-style air fryers in the UK or Australia, there are none with a dual oven setup.\nThat\u2019s unfortunate, since the Ninja Double Oven is certainly worth its admittedly high price of $349.99 (about \u00a3274 / AU$532), because not only does it arrive with a dual oven setup, but each has its own separate functions, too.\nIf you're short on space, this brand has a more compact two-basket air fryer \u2013 read about it in our Ninja Double Stack air fryer review. That one is more affordable, at $229.99 / \u00a3269.99 (not available in Australia at time of writing).\nAlso worth considering is the Ninja Foodi Dual Zone Air Fryer AF300, which sells for \u00a3179.99 / AU$399 (about $263). There are models that feature dual compartments that can be set to cook separately or finish at the same time just like the Ninja Double Oven. However, because of the basket form factor, you have less surface area to space out your food.\nOf course, if that dual oven functionality isn\u2019t so important, you can spend quite a bit less than you would on the Ninja Double Oven. The Cuisinart TOA-60 Air Fryer Toaster Oven at $229.95 / \u00a3250 does an excellent job, with seven cooking functions and the capacity to cook things like pizza.\nBe sure to check out the latest Ninja coupon codes for ways to save on this air fryer and other cooking appliances at the manufacturer.\nValue: 3/5\nNinja Double Oven review: specifications\nPrice | $349.99 (about \u00a3274 / AU$532) |\nCapacity | 11 liters (top oven), 15.6 liters (bottom oven) |\nWattage | 1800W |\nNo. of baskets | 2 |\nNo. of programmes | 12 |\nWeight | 31.2 pounds |\nExternal dimensions | 18.6 x 16.39 x 13.26 inches |\nNinja Double Oven review: Design\n- Double-oven design with individual functions and controls\n- Smart finish\n- Lots of accessories, but only one crumb tray\nThe most striking thing about the Ninja Double Oven is its two cooking compartments. Each offers six cooking functions, with different options to choose from.\nThe size of each compartment reflects this dual functionality, with the upper oven a fair bit smaller than the bottom. For instance, the top can broil, toast, bagel, reheat and keep warm, while the bottom does whole roast, air roast, air fry, convection bake, pizza and rehydrate.\nEach oven has its own set of three buttons, so you can select that particular oven and adjust the temperature and cooking time. There\u2019s also a general use dial, power and backlight buttons, as well as buttons for the included smart thermometer, not to mention the button for the smart finish feature.\nSince I\u2019ve mentioned that smart finish feature, it\u2019s quite a nifty inclusion that makes the Ninja Dual Oven even more convenient by letting you sync both ovens to complete cooking at the same time.\nThe last thing I\u2019ll mention here regarding the two-oven design is the design of the door. Along with a big handle to easily pull down the whole door, there\u2019s a latch to the left that, when pressed, only opens the top oven for access while the bottom oven continues cooking.\nAs you\u2019d expect with a souped-up air fryer oven such as this, the Ninja Double Oven comes with plenty of accessories from that smart thermometer to two sheet pans, two wire racks, an air fryer basket, and a crumb tray. While I appreciate that all the racks are dishwasher safe, I\u2019d have liked a second crumb tray for easier cleanup. Instead, I had to resort to putting some aluminum foil along the bottom of the lower oven to keep cleanup simple.\nDesign: 5/5\nNinja Double Oven review: Performance\n- Cooks evenly and consistently across all functions\n- Very easy to use\n- Cleaning is tough\nWhen it comes to actually cooking, the Ninja Double Oven stands up to the test. Regardless of whether I used the top oven or bottom for cooking nuggets, fries, pizza, toasting bread, and so on, the results were consistent.\nAll the functions worked as expected. I was particularly happy with the way the oven roasted broccoli \u2013 perfect, instead of burnt or dry \u2013 as well as the convection bake, which did a great job with potatoes. It was also ideal for making a vegan egg souffle. If there are any issues cooking with the Ninja Double Oven, it\u2019s likely to be the result of user error.\nBeyond its cooking ability, setting up each and even pairing both compartments\u2019 cooking times with the Smart Finish feature proved easy and straightforward. I didn\u2019t have to look in the manual to figure things out.\nInstead, I simply selected the functions and individual settings for each oven, hit the Smart Finish button, and then pressed the dial, which also functions as start and stop.\nThe only issue I have experienced with the Ninja Double Oven is trying to maintain it. The lack of a second crumb tray results in extra work to remove any oil that splatters on the side of the compartment.\nIf I want the air fryer looking its best, then using steel wool is probably the only way to remove that caked on oil. Unfortunately, this will likely be a common issue with oven-style air fryers. Nevertheless, it really is the only complaint here, aside of its premium price.\nPerformance: 4.5/5\nShould I buy the Ninja Double Oven?\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | It\u2019s pricey compared to a lot of the competition and is only available in the US. | 3/5 |\nDesign | Its dual-oven design with smart finish isn\u2019t only unique but well thought out, too. | 5/5 |\nPerformance | It cooks consistently and is easy to use. If only cleaning was just as easy. | 4.5/5 |\nOverall | While price and availability is less than stellar, everything else is pretty great. | 4.5/5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want to feed a lot of people\nWith two ovens that can be set to finish at the same time, you can easily get dinner ready quickly and efficiently.\nYou want lots of different cooking functions\nWhile the 12 cooking functions are split between the two ovens, having them all available delivers lots of versatility.\nYou want to splurge\nYes, the Ninja Double Oven is expensive, but if you want to have all your cooking bases covered, it\u2019s an ideal solution for cooking for small or large groups alike.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou\u2019re on a budget\nIf you\u2019d like an air fryer but don\u2019t quite have the budget for this model, don\u2019t fret. You can spend a third of the price and still end up with something decent.\nYou\u2019re not making large amounts of food at once\nAs useful as the dual-oven design is, if you\u2019re cooking for one or two people and don\u2019t require the Smart Finish functionality, you can save money and still get an excellent oven-style air fryer.\nAlso consider...\nCuisinart TOA-60 Air Fryer Toaster Oven\nIf you'd prefer to have two baskets rather than one then this Ninja model is worth considering. You'll have the ability to cook two different food types for two different durations.\nRead our full Cuisinart TOA-60 Air Fryer Toaster Oven review\nNinja Foodi Dual Zone Air Fryer AF300\nIf a basket-style air fryer is more your speed, this dual-basket model from Ninja lets you cook two food items at once, offering the ability to have cooking complete at the same time.\nRead our full Ninja Foodi Dual Zone Air Fryer AF300 review\nHow I tested\n- I used the Ninja Double Oven for a couple weeks\n- Cooked various items using the different functions\n- Put all its features to the test\nPutting the Ninja Double Oven Air Fryer through its paces over the course of a few weeks, I used it to cook a variety of foods \u2013 from pizzas to toast, to using the roasting function for veggies and the convection bake setting for an (vegan) egg souffl\u00e9. I also evaluated the different features, most notably Smart Finish, to see how well it worked.\nHaving spent some time with the Double Oven, I was able to come to a conclusion about the type of household it would most suit. While a single person or couple will happily be able to make use of its functions, its dual-oven design is ideal for those with limited time who want to cook bigger quantities of food that\u2019s ready at the same time.\nI\u2019ve been testing all sorts of tech gadgets, gear, and appliances for a few years now and have used that knowledge to figure out the ins and outs of this air fryer to see how well it measures up to expectations and the competition.\nRead more about how we test\nFirst reviewed August 2023\nJames Holland loves checking out gadgets of all sorts, whether it's audio equipment, laptops, or vacuums (especially of the robot variety), and does so for a number of Future Publications including TechRadar, Top Ten Reviews, Homes & Gardens, and T3.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Dreo ChefMaker is simply the best air fryer I\u2019ve tested, delivering incredibly crispy yet very moist results. But it\u2019s more than just an air fryer \u2013 it has a Chef mode and a Probe mode too, and those cook a lot of dishes to perfection, including the perfect steak. That\u2019s not to mention the seven additional cooking functions that most air fryers have. It also looks fantastic, making it the prettiest air fryer I\u2019ve seen. It is on the expensive side, but man oh man, it\u2019s worth every penny.\nPros\n- +\nAmazing results, whatever mode you\u2019re using\n- +\nIncredibly easy to use\n- +\nHelpful app, guides you through chef-curated recipes\n- +\nLooks sleek and beautiful\n- +\nVery responsive touch controls\nCons\n- -\nExpensive\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nDreo ChefMaker: One-minute review\nOutside of soups, casseroles, stews, and fondues, there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t cook in the Dreo ChefMaker. And I\u2019m not just talking about air-frying a steak here; I\u2019m talking about a properly and perfectly cooked steak that\u2019s worth serving in a steakhouse.\nThat\u2019s because while the ChefMaker is one of the best air fryers on the market, it\u2019s so much more than that. Much more. It has two other cooking modes, namely the Chef mode and the Probe mode, both of which deliver restaurant-worthy results. And Chef mode is supported by an app that comes with a plethora of clever Chef-curated recipes that are so delicious you'll feel like you\u2019ve got Thomas Keller whipping up dinners in your own kitchen.\nThis is perhaps my favorite kitchen appliance by far. Since using the ChefMaker I've enjoyed one of the best and cooked-to-perfection medium-rare steaks I\u2019ve ever had, home-cooked or otherwise. That\u2019s saying something because (1) I\u2019ve only cooked steak three times in my life, and (2) I didn\u2019t have to do anything here but prep the steak, insert the included probe and put it in the basket, and press a couple of buttons. The ChefMaker's air fryer function delivers super crispy yet super-moist results \u2013 the best results I\u2019ve gotten from any air fryer.\nIt\u2019s also a near-perfect product. It\u2019s sleek and beautiful; it\u2019s well-built and doesn\u2019t take up too much space; and its touch controls are so responsive that they feel luxe. It\u2019s also effortless to use, thanks in large part to its very useful app.\nI say near-perfect because there is the smaller matter of the price, which isn't small. All those features do come at a premium \u2013 not so high that the ChefMaker would be a luxury purchase, but definitely more than what a lot of people would expect to pay for an air fryer. However, I would say that it\u2019s worth every penny and then some. If you\u2019re thinking of buying an air fryer, you won\u2019t regret getting this one.\nDreo Chefmaker: price and availability\n- How much does it cost? $359 / \u00a3279 (about AU$540)\n- When is it available? Available now\n- Where can you get it? Available in the US and the UK\nThe Dreo ChefMaker is much more expensive than regular air fryers of the same size and capacity, and it\u2019s also pricier than most double-basket models. In fact, at $359 / \u00a3279 (about AU$540), it\u2019ll cost you as much as some large-capacity air fryer ovens. Now you may think that\u2019s too much for a combination cooker with a 6-quart / 5.7-liter basket capacity, but honestly, given its versatility and what it can do, I\u2019m mildly surprised that it doesn\u2019t cost more.\nUnfortunately for Australian customers, however, it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s available there at the time of writing. It is, however, readily available in the US and the UK.\n- Value: 4 / 5\nDreo ChefMaker: Specifications\n| Capacity: | 6 QT |\n| No of baskets: | 1 |\n| Temperature range: | 100F - 450F (38C - 232C) |\n| No of programmes: | 3 modes + 8 cooking functions |\n| Power/wattage: | 1800W |\n| Smart control: | App support |\n| Dimensions: | 10.59 x 15.67 x 14.65 in (26.8 x 39.8 x 37.2 cm) |\n| Weight: | 15.36 lb (6.97 kg) |\nDreo ChefMaker: Design\n- Easy to set up and use\n- Beautiful and fairly compact design\n- Touch controls are a pleasure to use\nSetting up the Dreo ChefMaker is just as easy as setting up a regular air fryer. You simply place the cooking tray at the bottom of the basket or the grilling rack at the top, slot in the basket, plug it in, and turn it out. The one thing to consider here is that the cord isn\u2019t very long, so you will have to find a spot in your kitchen that\u2019s close enough to the outlet, or have an extension cord handy.\nI\u2019ve always found the design of most air fryers unappealing, even the ones from Ninja, but I adore the design of the ChefMaker. Trapezoidal in shape with a gentle tapering in the front, it\u2019s got elegant rounded edges, a beautiful black-on-dark silver finish, and a long oval handle with a hollow middle.\nAt the top is a shallow square water tank for water, which the ChefMaker uses for cooking \u2013 it utilizes its water spray system for better results, and to ensure that the food doesn\u2019t dry up \u2013 with a square lid that\u2019s easy to pop off and replace. And at the front, just above the basket, is where you\u2019ll find the control panel, which has touch buttons and a big 4.3-inch display with a fairly extensive menu, so you can easily navigate through and choose your cooking mode or function, adjust temperature, change cooking time, and more.\nThe touch buttons are incredibly responsive and work perfectly with just a light tap, and the display is bright enough so that everything is visible, even when it\u2019s in a brightly-lit area. Thank goodness for its backlighting.\nThe ChefMaker is taller than many air fryers of the same capacity, and slightly heavier as well. But it really doesn\u2019t take up too much space, and is light enough to take with you if you want to use it offsite.\nJust like regular air fryers, it has its hot air vent in the back. One thing I\u2019ve noticed about this vent is that it blows a hot more hot air than other air fryers I\u2019ve tested \u2013 so much so that it\u2019s triggered my smoke and carbon monoxide detector that\u2019s above the hallway next to my kitchen a few times. So be sure you\u2019re leaving enough space for it to 'breathe.'\nAs far as cleaning, the trays and the basket are all dish-washer safe \u2013 though they are fairly-easy to hand wash, especially the basket since it is non-stick. The inside of the appliance can be cleaned the usual way.\n- Design: 5 / 5\nDreo ChefMaker: Performance\n- Air fryer produces crisp and moist results\n- Chef mode makes the best dishes\n- Vent produces a lot of hot air\nIf I could only keep one tabletop cooking appliance in my kitchen, I would probably go with the Dreo ChefMaker. It\u2019s not ideal for making stews, soups and other dishes drenched in sauce or gravy \u2013 if you make a lot of those, you should probably go with one of the best multicookers \u2013 but while I do enjoy a good stew, those are easy to make using my good old stove, whereas the ChefMaker actually allows me to not just quickly whip up meals when I\u2019m pressed for time, but also make dishes that I don\u2019t usually make, like a good steak or a tender brisket.\nIt\u2019s not just versatility and effortless cooking that the ChefMaker offers. All the dishes I\u2019ve made in it, from the air fryer recipes I found online to the ones on the Dreo app, are cooked to perfection. I\u2019m particularly impressed that its air fryer function delivers better results than other regular air fryers I\u2019ve tested, producing gorgeously and evenly cooked results that are super crispy on the outside and mind-bogglingly moist on the inside.\nMy favorite chicken wings recipe, Vietnamese chicken wings, came out even better when I made them with the ChefMaker, as did my favorite pork belly recipe. And I didn\u2019t even need to fill up the water tank, or adjust the temperature or cooking time from the recipes, to get those results.\nThe water tank does play a massive role when using the cooker\u2019s Chef and Probe modes, however. The ChefMaker uses water atomization via its water spray system, and super convection heating, with the occasional assistance of the included dual-sensing probe, to cook dishes, and the combination works wonderfully.\nI tried several of the Chef mode recipes on the Dreo app, including the Perfect Steak and the Garlic Parmesan Potato Wedge recipes, and they were not only easy to make but also came out incredible, with the steak nicely seared but beautifully pink in the middle and very tender, and the potatoes coming out with a nice crisp.\nThe best part about making the steak was it took the guesswork and a chunk of the work out of the whole thing \u2013 just what a steak-cooking novice like me needs. I\u2019ve only really made steak three times in my life, so while two out of those three came out great, I\u2019m not exactly a steak master. With the help of the ChefMaker, however, my fourth steak came out steakhouse-worthy.\nFair warning, though: the Dreo ChefMaker seems to produce a lot more heat than regular air fryers, even when it\u2019s on air fryer mode. Even when there\u2019s a lot of space behind its rear vent, it still manages to set off my smoke and carbon monoxide detector which is a few feet away in the hallway next to my kitchen. This never happened with the similar-capacity air fryers I\u2019ve tested. I did, however, find that turning on my range hood helps minimize that issue.\nThis also was not a deal-breaker for me, especially since my kitchen isn't the biggest, and the bigger air fryer ovens I've tested have done the same thing.\n- Performance: / 5\nShould I buy the Dreo ChefMaker?\n| Attribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\n| Value | This is a pretty pricey appliance, but it\u2019s well-worth the money. | 4.5 / 5 |\n| Design | It\u2019s elegantly-beautiful in design, has very responsive touch controls, a large display, and easy to clean components. | 5 / 5 |\n| Performance | It produces incredible results, whether you\u2019re air fryer chicken wings or cooking a proper steak. | 5 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou\u2019re looking for an incredibly versatile combination cooker\nThe ChefMaker is not just an air fryer. It has two other incredibly effective cook modes plus seven additional cooking functions.\nYou aren\u2019t on a budget\nIt costs about as much as the bigger air fryer ovens and much more than other air fryers with a similar basket capacity. However, it can do so much more, and is a great value for money.\nYou want the best air fryer on the shelves\nThis is probably the best air fryer I\u2019ve tested, producing crispy-on-the-outside, moist-on-the-inside results.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou don\u2019t have the funds\nIf you\u2019re on a tight budget, better look elsewhere. Or, better yet, save up until you have enough to get it without blowing your monthly budget.\nYou prefer to cook on the stove\nIf you prefer to cook your meats and vegetables the traditional way \u2013 aka stovetop \u2013 this probably isn\u2019t the best investment for you.\nYou need something with a bigger capacity\nWith a 6-qt / 5.7-liter basket, it\u2019s not ideal if you\u2019re cooking a big batch or for a large group. You can purchase a second basket to make it slightly easier, but it\u2019s still not going to be as convenient as something with a large-capacity basket.\nDreo ChefMaker: Also consider\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Dreo ChefMaker | Cuisinart TOA-60 Air Fryer Toaster Oven | Ninja Foodi Dual Zone Air Fryer AF300 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Price: | $359 / \u00a3279 (about AU$540) | $229.95 / \u00a3250 | $349.99 (about \u00a3274 / AU$532) |\n| Capacity: | 6 QT | 0.6-cubic-foot | 7.6L |\n| No of baskets: | 1 | Oven style | 2 |\n| Temperature range: | 100F - 450F (38C - 232C) | Up to 450F (240C) | Up to 450F (240C) |\n| No of programmes: | 3 modes + 8 cooking functions | 8 functions | 6 |\n| Power/wattage: | 1800W | 1800W | 2400W |\n| Smart control: | App support | Row 6 - Cell 2 | Row 6 - Cell 3 |\n| Dimensions: | 10.59 x 15.67 x 14.65 in (26.8 x 39.8 x 37.2 cm) | 22.13 x 17.75 x 16.38 in (56.2 x 45 x 41.6 cm) | 12.4 x 14.9 x 10.4 in (31.5 x 38 x 26.5 cm) |\n| Weight: | 15.36 lb (6.97 kg) | 25.6 lb (11.6 kg) | 18 lb (8.2 kg) |\nCuisinart TOA-60 Air Fryer Toaster Oven\nIf you'd prefer to have two baskets rather than one then this Ninja model is worth considering.

      "text": "The best air fryer 2025: quick and convenient fryers to feed a family\nAir fryers for quick meals in small spaces\nThe best air fryers could completely change your food preparation. Air fryers need a lot less oil than you'd use for regular frying, which means you'll get healthier food that's just as delicious, and because they're much smaller than standard ovens they heat up quicker and cook faster and more efficiently. So not only will you get your dinner much sooner, you'll save on energy bills too.\nAir fryers don't actually fry food in the conventional sense. They're compact ovens that sit on your countertop and mimic the effects of frying with hot air and powerful fans that are large relative to the cooking space. Combined with designs that maximize airflow, they quickly deliver crisp and great-tasting results with not very much oil.\nOur expert reviewers have tested dozens of of air fryers, from budget models with minimal options through to high-end smart models and dual-basket air fryers that enable you to cook an entire meal in one go. They put them through standardized tests to gauge their performance on basic cooking, and also assess how easy they are to use and clean, and whether they offer good value for money.\nAccording to price comparison site GoCompare, an air fryer costs significantly less to run than a conventional oven, but more than a microwave, so it's worth considering what you'll be cooking and whether the investment will be worthwhile.\nFor us the best air overall is the Ninja Double Stack, thanks to its ability to cook two portions of food to perfection while taking up minimal counter space, but it's not the only option and there are lots more excellent choices depending on your priorities.\nThe latest addition to this guide is the Philips 1000 Series Dual Basket Air Fryer, which is big enough to feed a family, and cooked the best green beans our reviewer had ever had from an air fryer.\nThe quick list\nBelow is our quick guide to the best air fryers around. Use it to narrow down your options, then either hop down to the more in-depth entry, or head straight to a retailer to buy.\nBest overall\nFor small kitchens\nThis air fryer stacks two baskets vertically to maximize cooking space within a small footprint - an innovative design that works so well, we awarded it the prize for best air fryer in the 2024 TechRadar Choice Awards. It cooks brilliantly too, with virtually no transfer of heat between the two baskets, meaning you can cook two completely different dishes at different temperatures .\nGreat value\nBest budget air fryer\nThis 9L capacity air fryer proves that you don't have to spend a fortune to cook for a family. Its no-nonsense design makes it easy to use, and provided you read the manual well beforehand, you should enjoy consistently good results. We appreciated its small but well-curated selection of cooking presets as well, and in our tests it out-performed more expensive air fryers with ease.\nTop performer\nBest air fryer/microwave combo\nIf you don't have space in your kitchen for both an air fryer and a microwave, this is the ideal solution. During our tests we were impressed by its intuitive controls, which made it easy to use despite its wealth of features, and although it wasn't as fast as a standard air fryer, it performed well across the board.\nPortable\nBest portable air fryer\nThere aren't many mobile air fryers around, and the Ninja Crispi has set a high bar. It uses resealable glass containers that attach to a lid that contains the heating element and fan. SharkNinja suggests using it to heat leftovers at work, and during our tests it did a particularly great job of fries with results that rival conventional air fryers.\nEasy to use\nEasiest air fryer to use\nUsing an air fryer for the first time can be a challenge (they're quite different to a conventional oven) but the Kalorik Vivid Touch helps take the guesswork out of figuring our how to cook your favorite foods. Its large, clear touchscreen makes it a piece of cake to use, letting you choose settings optimized for different dishes. It worked a treat during our tests, and we'd highly recommend it to beginners.\nExtra large\nBest large air fryer\nIf you're cooking for a family, this twin-drawer model is a great choice \u2013 and it cooks most dishes to perfection. Our reviewer said it cooked the best green beans she'd had from an air fryer, chicken was juicy and succulent, and even muffins turned out perfectly. It's affordably priced, too.\nMulti-functional\nBest air fryer and grill combo\nThis all-in-one air fryer can bake, grill, dehydrate, and roast \u2013 and does it all brilliantly. It's a particularly good choice for meat-eaters thanks to its built-in temperature probe, which helped us cook perfectly moist chicken and succulent beef during our tests. It took some experimentation to master the air frying function, but once we got the knack it was superb.\nPremium\nBest premium air fryer\nThe Dreo ChefMaker is much more than just an air fryer - it takes the effort and guesswork out of cooking virtually any meal, and is particularly great for preparing meat. During testing we found it produced restaurant-quality steak every time. If your budget can handle it, it's highly recommended\nOptional steam\nBest air fryer with steam\nSmeg's countertop appliance does a whole lot more than just make golden fries - it can also make like a regular convection oven, and generate steam for moist meat and fish. During testing we really appreciated its versatility, wealth of presets, and its stunning 1960s-inspired design.\nMeet the expert\nHelen has been reviewing small appliances, including blenders, air fryers, and vacuums for more than 15 years, and has written for many of the biggest home-related titles around. She puts air fryers through a thorough battery of tests, and you can trust her to give you the full lowdown on their performance.\nThe best air fryer 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best air fryer overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 Space is at a premium: Its two-tier design means the Ninja Double Stack can cook far more food than other air fryers with the same footprint.\n\u2705 You want to cook several different foods at once: With two baskets and four trays, this air fryer is a great multi-tasker.\n\u274c You want to cook pizzas: The Double Stack's vertical arrangement means it's not best suited to large items of food.\n\u274c You want to cook wet foods: The fairly large holes at the back of the baskets make this a bad idea.\nWith most air fryers, the more generous the cooking capacity, the more counter space you'll need to sacrifice. This Ninja model cleverly avoids that issue by stacking its baskets one on top of the other, rather than side-by-side. It's such a smart design, we gave it the prize for Best Air Fryer in the 2024 TechRadar Choice Awards. Each drawer holds 5qts / 4.75L, and you can create even more cooking space by slotting in one of the provided trays. Although do note that the tall-rather-than-wide approach means you won't get able to fit in, say, an uncut pizza. (If you just need something compact and don't need a large capacity, head to our guide to the best small air fryers.)\nIn our review, our tester noted no compromise in performance with this new design approach \u2013 the Double Stack delivers the same excellent performance as other Ninja air fryers we've tested. A wide range of different cooking modes make this model ultra-versatile, while the Sync and Match functions take all the pain out of cooking foods with different timing requirements \u2013 select your cooking mode, set your finish time and, if you're synchronizing the two baskets, select the cooking times for each, and it'll do the math for you. There's also virtually no heat leakage between the two trays, which is good news if you\u2019re dealing with precise foods or don't want to waste energy when only using one basket.\nThe main down-side here is that the Double Stack is pricier than other dual-basket air fryers, so if you don't need to save on counter space you could get something as good for a lower price. But if you have a small kitchen, it could be well worth the extra investment.\nRead our full Ninja Double Stack review\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Pricier than most dual-drawer air fryers, but delivers a unique design and great performance for your money. | 4.5/5 |\nDesign | An ingenious design with a small footprint and generous capacity, plus dishwasher-friendly baskets. | 5/5 |\nPerformance | The great performance you'd expect from a Ninja air fryer with very little heat transfer between the two tiers for even cooking. | 5/5 |\nThe best budget air fryer\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to cook two meal components at once: Whether you want to use Match or Sync, this air fryer can help you make mealtimes easier by setting each basket to its own temperature and time, or preset.\n\u2705 You want a high quality air fryer without too many extras: The Satisfry does its job with little fuss, and for a very reasonable price.\n\u274c You have a big family: Our reviewer has a household of two, and this air fryer felt like the right size to make larger meals.\n\u274c You don't live in the UK: This particular fryer isn't available in other locations at the time of writing.\nThis versatile twin-drawer air fryer has a list price of \u00a3199 (about $250 / AU$400), but you can find it online for half that price, making it incredible value. It's a great-looking appliance too, with a matt black finish and champagne-toned accents, though it's also relatively large so you'll need to measure your kitchen counter to make sure it'll fit comfortably.\nIt has several features you'd expect to find in much pricier models, such as synced timing so you can cook two different foods and have them finish at the same time. It doesn't have as many presets as some others, but those it does offer will cover all the essentials (including steal, fries, chicken, and pizza), and in our tests they performed very well. We also achieved good results for other dishes by paying close attention to the instructions in the manual, which helps take the guesswork out of preparing your favorite meals.\nThere are a few quirks, and we found that it wasn't ideal for baking, but the Russell Hobbs Satisfry punches well above its weight and you won't find a better air fryer for the price.\nRead our full Russell Hobbs Satisfry Dual Basket Air Fryer review\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\nValue | While the price is premium, this air fryer is a solid investment and offers better quality than some higher-priced competition. | 4.5/5 |\nDesign | A stylish matte black appliance with champagne accents, but make sure you have room for it. | 4/5 |\nPerformance | A range of functions and features, with solid results. May require some experimentation and air fryer experience for optimal results. | 4.5/5 |\nThe best air fryer/microwave combo\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You don't have much room: If you enjoy cooking but don't have space for multiple appliances, this is a good option.\n\u2705 You use other Samsung Smart Home devices: You can manage them all through Samsung's SmartThings app.\n\u274c You don't really need a microwave: The Samsung Combi doesn't get quite as hot as a standalone air fryer, and takes a bit longer to get your fries crisp.\n\u274c You don't want to use an app at all: Some of the Samsung Combi's settings and options are only accessible through the mobile app.\nIf you don't have room for both an air fryer and a microwave on your kitchen counter, this multifunctional cooker from Samsung combines them into a single appliance - and it works as a convection oven and a grill as well.\nDuring our tests we found that the Samsung Combi took a bit longer than a standard air dryer to crisp our fries, but it was extremely versatile. There's a huge array of presets, but the intuitive controls make them easy to find and select, and the mobile app allows you to control it from afar. We were particularly impressed by its capabilities as a convection oven, and could see it replacing a freestanding oven in a small kitchen if you're particularly short of space, or need to make room for a dishwasher.\nIt's certainly not small, and it's pricier than most of the single-purpose air fryers in this guide, but it has a smart design that won't look out of place in a modern kitchen, and it can replace so many other appliances that it does represent good value.\nRead our full Samsung Combi Smart Microwave Oven review\nAttribute | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | Pricey compared to standalone microwaves and air fryers, but high quality and offers a wide range of functions. | 4/5 |\nDesign | Large and bulky but looks smart and feels high-quality. Intuitive controls. | 4.5/5 |\nPerformance | Great at convection cooking, grilling and microwaving, but less so at air frying. It's helpful to use the app, if only to avoid so much beeping. | 3.5/5 |\nThe best portable air fryer\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to crisp food on the move: The Crispi is specifically designed for this, letting you store food in sealable containers and then heat it when and where it suits you.\n\u2705 You want to minimize cleanup: You can store, cook, and serve food from the glass containers, which are dishwasher safe.\n\u274c You want something to keep on your counter: The Ninja Crispi is functional rather than beautiful. Other Ninja air fryers are more appealing if you want something to keep on view.\n\u274c You plan to do a lot of baking: Making muffins in the Crispi proved less successful than other air fryers (though it's not really designed for baking).\nTechnically you could carry any air fryer around with you, and use it wherever there's an electrical outlet, but doing so would be extremely cumbersome and awkward. That's where the Ninja Crispi comes in. Rather than a drawer, your food is held in resealable glass containers that you can carry around and store in the fridge like regular Tupperware. When you want to cook, just remove the regular lid and attach the Crispi PowerPod, which contains the heating element and fan, and switch it on.\nIt's an interesting design, and during our tests we were impressed by how well it handled everyday dishes like fries, which turned out perfectly golden on the outside and fluffy inside whether they were fresh or frozen.\nBaking in the Crispi proved less successful, but since this is mostly an air fryer designed for heating and crisping, that shouldn't be too much of an issue in everyday use.\nCleanup is refreshingly simple because you don't need to clean the PowerPod \u2013 only the glass containers and lids, which are dishwasher-safe or can be washed by hand. We also tried using paper air fryer liners, which made things even easier.\nRead our full Ninja Crispi review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | The Ninja Crispi isn\u2019t your typical air fryer at all; the unique design makes it worth its price tag. | 3/5 |\nDesign | While it\u2019s not particularly pretty, it\u2019s cleverly designed with the PowerPod and glass dishes that go from cooking to serving to storing your food. | 4.5/5 |\nPerformance | Air Fry, Max Crisp, and Recrisp modes are great; Bake mode is less so. | 4.5/5 |\nThe best air fryer for first-time users\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You prefer a touchscreen over buttons: There's no need to spend ages poring over a manual - this air fryer explains everything on its large touchscreen.\n\u2705 You want to keep an eye on your food: Some air fryers keep you in the dark, but not the Kalorik Touch - just tap the lightbulb icon to see inside without interrupting the cooking cycle.\n\u274c You lack counter space: This air fryer isn't ugly, but it does take up a lot of room - particularly if you opt for the 7Qt model.\n\u274c You plan to do a lot of baking: We've had better results from other air fryers when it comes to cakes and bread.\nUsing an air fryer for the first time can be a bit of a daunting experience - it's very different to cooking in a conventional oven or microwave, and it often takes plenty of trial and error before you're confident preparing your favorite dishes. The Kalorik Vivid Touch makes things a whole lot easier thanks to its large, bright touchscreen, which lets you browse through a huge collection of presets quickly and effortlessly.\nThe Kalorik Vivid Touch produced impressive results during our tests, and we were particularly impressed by how well it handled fries. Whether fresh or frozen, they turned out deliciously crisp on the outside and fluffy within.\nWe also appreciated the ability to check on our dishes without interrupting the cooking cycle by opening the drawer. Just tap the lightbulb button on the fryer to see what's happening inside without letting the heat out.\nWe wouldn't recommend this air fryer if you're hoping to do a lot of baking as our results were somewhat uneven, but for everyday meals it's excellent, and comes highly recommended for first-time users.\nRead our full Kalorik Vivid Touch Touchscreen Air Fryer review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Though the price is in line with typical air fryers, the easy touchscreen operation adds value. | 4.5/5 |\nDesign | Lookswise, the design is nothing special. But the high-resolution touch screen and interior light level up the design score. | 4.5/5 |\nPerformance | It performs as expected from an air fryer, keeping in mind that the heat comes only from the top so flipping is essential. | 4/5 |\nThe best extra large capacity air fryer\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a spacious air fryer that won't dominate your kitchen: This air fryer offers good capacity but isn't huge and bulky.\n\u2705 You want an air fryer for under \u00a3150: This air fryer might not be perfect, but it's great value at \u00a3133.99 and is much higher quality than others we've seen in this price range.\n\u274c You want a heap of extra features: This air fryer doesn't come with a bunch of extra features, functions, or smart control \u2013 it sticks to the basics.\n\u274c You have a small sink or dishwasher: The non-stick coating helps, but the XXL basket is chunky and a struggle to clean, even in a fairly large sink.\nThis extra-large air fryer has enough cooking capacity to feed a family, delivers consistently good results for a wide range of foods, and is very reasonably priced too. If you're looking for a fryer that can cater for a crowd, it comes highly recommended. It's not available in the US, though. If you're outside the UK, the closest model is the Philips 3000 Series Dual Basket Air Fryer.\nAccording to our reviewer Vic Hood, \"when the 1000 Series works well, it's excellent: chicken is succulent with just enough crispiness on the skin, muffins are soft inside without being dry, and chips (homemade and frozen) are golden and fluffy inside.\"\nThe biggest downside for us is the instructions. You'll have to go online to get the full manual, and even then, the food and cooking time tables provided aren't as detailed as we'd like. However, the app is packed with great recipe ideas, and the fryer's presets work well.\nRead our full Philips 1000 Series Dual Basket Air Fryer review\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Great value for a solid air fryer, but don't expect the consistency and high quality of more premium appliances. | 4.5/5 |\nDesign | A sleek and fairly compact air fryer given its spacious capacity, but Philips has dropped the ball with its user manual, so you'll need to use the Home ID app for thorough instructions. | 4/5 |\nPerformance | It produced some of the best air-fried food I've had in all my testing. However, the user manual food tables could have more detail on optimal preparation and the settings to use for more common foods. | 4/5 |\nThe best air fryer and grill combo\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want BBQ flavor in your kitchen: If you don't have space for an outdoor grill, this is an excellent option.\n\u2705 You cook meat and fish regularly: The heat probe makes it easy to ensure meat is cooked through, but still tender and juicy.\n\u274c You won't keep up with cleaning: The air fryer grill is relatively tough to clean, but proper maintenance is essential.\n\u274c You want to keep things as simple as possible: The air fryer function took some getting used to, and produced uneven results until we became familiar with its idiosyncrasies.\nThis is the best multi-functional air fryer we've tested this year, and its roast, grill, bake, and dehydrate modes blew us away during testing.\nIt's a particularly great choice if you enjoy meat thanks to its built-in heat probe, which helps ensure your dishes are properly heated all the way through, but still moist and juicy. Our chicken and beef were cooked to perfection, as were our burgers.\nWe rarely achieve great results when baking with an air fryer, but the Ninja 5-in-1 is the exception. We made perfect herb flatbreads and blueberry muffins, which were evenly cooked and (in the case of the muffins) perfectly risen, just as if we'd made them using a conventional oven.\nOnly the air frying mode let us down slightly, producing somewhat inconsistent results until we got used to its idiosyncrasies. If you're looking for an air fryer to replace your oven though, this would be a solid choice. It's big enough to feed a family of four, and super versatile (though the grill takes a little more scrubbing than most air fryer accessories).\nWant to save on a Ninja air fryer? Check out our Ninja discounts for the latest deals on high-performance cooking essentials.\nRead our full Ninja 5-in-1 Grill and Air Fryer review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Although it's quite pricey for an air fryer, this 5-in-1 air fryer isn't one of Ninja's most expensive models, and it gives you a lot for your money. | 4.5/ 5 |\nDesign | Large enough for a family of four, with a good selection of accessories. We just wish they were easier to clean. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | Consistently good results for most modes, but air frying was a little hit and miss until we got used to it. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best premium air fryer\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the best of the best: The Dreo ChefMaker delivers consistently excellent results, if your budget can handle it.\n\u2705 You're willing to spend serious cash: This performance doesn't come cheap, and the ChefMaker is one of the most expensive air fryers we've tested.\n\u274c You rarely cook meat: The ChefMaker's temperature probe and water atomizer system work particularly well for steaks, chicken and other meats, but if you're a veggie then they may be less useful.\n\u274c You need an extra large capacity: Check out the Ninja Double Oven instead if you want to cook particularly big portions.\nThe Dreo ChefMaker is so impressive with its cooking prowess and its ability to deliver moist-on-the-inside and crispy-on-the-outside results. That\u2019s due to the fact that this air fryer is able to cook more precisely than many others.\nRather than the usual presets (bake, dehydrate, reheat etc), the ChefMaker offers Chef Mode, Classic Cook, and Probe Cook, so that you can either fine-tune the cooking experience, set it and forget it, or have the machine cook your food until its internal temperature is right where you want it, thanks to a nifty probe aka food thermometer that\u2019s included in the box.\nDuring testing, every meal we prepared turned out perfectly. We were particularly impressed by the way the ChefMaker cooked steak, with results that wouldn't look out of place in a restaurant.\nThe transparent glass basket is also a nice addition as you can keep visual tabs on your food without pulling the basket out. We also appreciate the fact that the components are dishwasher safe. And, though water atomization and super convection seem like buzzwords that Dreo applies here, make no mistake. This is a powerful, if pricey, air fryer.\nRead our full Dreo ChefMaker review\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | This is a pretty pricey appliance, but it\u2019s well-worth the money. | 4.5 / 5 |\nDesign | It\u2019s elegantly-beautiful in design, has very responsive touch controls, a large display, and easy to clean components. | 5 / 5 |\nPerformance | It produces incredible results, whether you\u2019re air fryer chicken wings or cooking a proper steak. | 5 / 5 |\nThe best air fryer with steam\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to cook more than just fries: The Combi lets you air fry, bake, steam, and more with a flick of the dials.\n\u2705 You have a small living space: It won't replace an oven for family cooking, but for one or two people in a compact apartment, this could free up valuable space.\n\u274c Money is a consideration: At over $1,000, this definitely isn't a budget option and costs more than some full-size ovens.\n\u274c You live outside the US: It may launch in other territories soon, but for now this little oven is only available in the United States.\nThe super chic Smeg Combi Steam Oven is a lot more than just an air fryer. It also functions as a small convection oven, just the right size for preparing a cake, loaf or a pan of muffins, and as the name suggests, it has a steam mode that's ideal for keeping meat and fish succulent.\nIt also has an excellent range of preset modes for different dishes, and during our tests these worked extremely well, taking any guesswork out of cooking. Our reviewer Karen Freeman prepared frozen and freshly made fries according to the instructions, and reported that \"In both cases, the fries came out crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and totally delicious.\"\nRoasted vegetables and veggie burgers also turned out perfectly (even sprouts), and both frozen and homemade pizzas \"came out perfect: lightly browned, fully cooked in the middle, not burnt anywhere.\"\nThere are a few potential drawbacks. For example, in addition to its high price tag, this multi-function appliance probably won't be able to replace your oven if you're cooking for more than two people - it's just not large enough inside. It also proved somewhat tricky to de-grease. It could be an excellent choice for individuals or couples in small living spaces though, freeing up valuable space under your kitchen counters.\nRead our full Smeg Combi Steam Oven review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | It\u2019s just very pricey, and hard to justify given that it doesn\u2019t fully replace either an oven or a toaster oven. | 3/5 |\nDesign | It\u2019s gorgeous and designed for maximum flexibility with tons of cooking options (except, oddly enough, a dedicated toast function). | 4.5/5 |\nPerformance | Everything I made across a variety of cooking functions was delicious. However, a thorough cleanup is tough. | 4.5/5 |\nWe also tested\nWe've tested 45 different air fryers here at TechRadar. Here are some of the ones we've tried that didn't quite make our shortlist:\nNinja Foodi Max Dual Zone Air Fryer AF400\nThis is a great twin-drawer air fryer that's just beaten by the Ninja Double Stack due to its larger footprint and relatively high price tag. It could be a great buy if you can catch it on Black Friday, though.\nRead our full Ninja Foodi Max Dual Zone Air Fryer AF400 review\nNinja Combi Multi-Cooker\nA good option for cooks who want more than just an air fryer, the Ninja Combi can also steam, bake, broil, and sear. We found it tricky to set the mode we wanted though, there's no way to easily empty the condensation tray, and it emits a lot of steam in some modes.\nRead our full Ninja Combi Multi-Cooker review\nTower Vortx 4L Digital Air Fryer\nThis air fryer fits firmly into the 'cheap and cheerful' category. It's affordably priced, but has a very small capacity that's only really suited to a single person. It's also quite bulky considering how little you can fit inside its single drawer.\nRead our full Tower Vortx 4L Digital Air Fryer review\nSunbeam Multi Zone Air Fryer Oven\nThis good-looking air fryer gives you lots of cooking space, making it a good option for families, but there are also lots of surfaces to keep clean. During our tests we also noticed that the light doesn't always come on during cooking so you can see your food, which is a small frustration.\nRead our full Sunbeam Multi Zone Air Fryer Oven review\nProCook Air Fryer Health Grill\nThis is a good value alternative to pricier air fryer from the likes of SharkNinja, with intuitive controls and good cooking performance. It's not perfect, though - it's bulky and heavy, and its preheat setting took longer than we'd have liked to reach the set temperature.\nRead our full ProCook Air Fryer Health Grill review\nNinja Foodi FlexBasket Dual Air Fryer\nThis extra-large air fryer can cook enough for eight people, and benefits from a divider that lets you cook one large dish or to separate ones. The downside is that it's really, really big. You'll need a lot of spare space on your kitchen counter to accommodate it.\nRead our full Ninja Foodi FlexBasket Dual Air Fryer review\nHow to choose the best air fryer for you\nWhat will you be cooking?\nDifferent air fryers work best for different foods. Basket air fryers tend to be healthier because they funnel the juices, as well as the fat, away from the food but you can\u2019t check on the food without opening them and letting cold air in, which can stall the cooking process. Bowl air fryers often have glass lids so you can keep an eye on your meal, but the cooking juices remain in the air fryer and in contact with the food, making it tastier but not as healthy.\nHow much will you be cooking?\nIf you\u2019re feeding four or more mouths, look for larger air fryers, which can hold around 6.5 quarts / 6 liters, while couples will find designs that have a capacity of around 2.5 quarts / 2.5 liters will be sufficient. Some of the best air fryers also have more than one compartment, which means you can cook multiple foods at the same time. For more tips and tricks on getting the most out of your appliance, take a look at our guide to how air fryers work.\nHow much space do you have?\nIf you\u2019re tight on space look for air fryers that offer a multitude of different cooking methods, to cut down on the number of appliances that clutter up your kitchen countertop. Sometimes an air fryer isn't the right appliance. For example, you could consider an Instant Pot or alternative multi-cookers, which includes some models that mimic the effect of a standalone air fryer.\nDo you want to control it remotely?\nConsider whether you want an air fryer with smart features that means you can switch it on or off from your smartphone.\nWhat is your budget?\nThe price of air fryers varies enormously, with budget models starting below $100, and large-capacity premium fryers costing well over $300.\nWhat types of air fryers are there?\nBasket air fryers\nBasket air fryers are the most popular type of air fryer. They have a slide-out basket or tray which slots in to the main unit, and tend to be available as a single or dual-drawer. Food like fries may be browned unevenly if it isn't rearranged or tossed around during cooking.\nOven-style air fryers\nThese are much larger than basket air fryers, and are often about the same size as a microwave. They have a door rather than a drawer, and use shelves rather than baskets. The air frying function is able to circulate air around the food more efficiently to achieve a more even crisp. Some may also include a rotisserie, and other accessories.\nHalogen ovens\nAlthough sometimes described as air fryers, halogen ovens work in a different way. Instead of circulating hot air a halogen oven uses infrared to constantly heat the food. This means that they can be more versatile than the more traditional air fryer, with a larger capacity and more forgiving shape of cooking area.\nFrequently asked questions about air fryers\nIs air-fried food healthier?\nAir fryers use substantially less oil than deep frying: some foods, most of which are frozen or have naturally occurring fat, like chicken wings, are suitable for air frying without any oil at all. Fries, roast potatoes, and other traditional crisp foods will need some oil, but how much varies between air fryers.\nIn our tests, manufacturers' instructions have recommended anywhere from 1tsp to 1tbsp of oil per 1.1lb / 500g of fries, so if you want to use as little oil as possible - we'd suggest you check how oil is required before you purchase a specific model. It's also crucial to remember the healthiness of what you make in your air fryer all depends on what you actually put in it, to begin with. To find out more, read how healthy are air fryers?\nWhat can you cook in an air fryer?\nFries, roast potatoes, chicken wings and other deep-fried favorites are obvious dishes to cook in an air fryer, but that's not all you can whip up in one of these handy kitchen gadgets. You can prepare anything you can cook in a traditional fan oven, space permitting, because they work in the same way.\nSo whether that's frozen foods, mini pizzas, or even gnocchi and ravioli - it can all be cooked in an air fryer. You can even make fudgy brownies in an air fryer, in less time than it takes in an oven.\nWe've tried to cook pretty much everything apart from soup in an air fryer. We found that an air fryer can rival KFC when it comes to fried chicken, and was also the answer when it came to creating crisp, crunchy crackling on pork belly.\nIt also proved to be the best way to cook cinnamon rolls and Krispy-Kreme-style donuts.\nAs well as being used in place of an oven, air fryers can be an easier way to prepare dishes usually cooked on a stove, without having to watch them like a hawk and turn them before they burn. In particular, we discovered French Toast and grilled cheese work extremely well in the kitchen gadget.\nIf you're a fan of fries but unsure how to go about making them in an air fryer, then check out our advice, which even details an air fryer trick that's a game-changer when it comes to cooking fries.\nWe're also big fans of reheating takeout in air fryers: they're particularly good for pizza and fried chicken.\nIf you're still unsure we've got plenty of inspiration when it comes to what you can cook in an air fryer?.\nHow much does it cost to run an air fryer?\nThe exact price will depend on your energy tariff and how powerful your air fryer is, but according to UK price comparison site CoGompare, \"The cost of running an air fryer can vary between roughly 9.8p and 24.6.p for 30 minutes.\"\nThat works out at \u00a335.77 based on 9.8p for 30 minutes a day, and \u00a389.79 based on 24.6p for 30 minutes a day.\nThat's not as cheap as a microwave, but microwaves and air fryers serve different purposes. An air fryer is more of a substitute for a conventional oven, which would use much more energy.\nWhat can't be cooked in an air fryer?\nAir fryers are very versatile but there are some things you should avoid. For example, we found 5 foods to avoid putting in an air fryer. These include foods dipped in batter, as the liquid will simply slide off the item and leave a mess in the frying basket. Anything lightweight, such as an individual slice of bread or leafy greens, is likely to get blown around the cooking cavity. That means it may cook unevenly or even burn.\nWith many air fryers large joints of meat can be tricky too: if they're too big for the drawer the hot air can't circulate properly. That means the joint won't be evenly crisped and browned. And we wouldn't recommend trying to cook red meat medium rare or medium: the outside cooks too quickly and can leave the center raw.\nHow does an air fryer work?\nDespite its name, an air fryer doesn't actually fry. Utilizing a very cleverly designed fan oven, it efficiently uses airflow to cook in a way and at a speed that conventional ovens, even fan ones, cannot.\nSome of the best air fryers are also multi-cookers, meaning that the air circulated doesn't just air fry. A single countertop device can make tasty fries but also work as a toaster oven, a dehydrator, a slow cooker and a pizza oven, as well as heat up last night's takeout leftovers and bake brilliant bagels too.\nHow we tested these air fryers\n1. Real-world cooking\nTo compare each air fryer, we cooked up batches and batches of fries and chicken wings, and evaluated the results for crispness and evenness of browning. In the case of chicken wings, we also checked how moist and juicy the meat was.\n2. Odor analysis\nPlenty of cooking modes are a bonus, as are features like odor-reduction to limit the spread of cooking smells, but we also appreciate an air fryer that didn't require us to read a thick instruction book before we could get started. We rated each machine on ease of use, how loud its fans become (some are much noisier than others), and how hot the exterior casing got during use.\n3. Control checking\nThe type of controls is an important consideration (physical buttons or a touchscreen), as is the inclusion of a window and/or light that lets you check on the food while it's cooking without opening the air fryer and allowing heat to escape.\n4. Cleaning and maintenance\nAfterwards, we rated each machine on its ease of cleaning, and durability of its body and parts. Some air fryers have components that are dishwasher-safe, while others must be cleaned entirely by hand.\n5. Added extras\nExtra features like accessories and recipe books for ideas are a welcome addition, as are cooking charts that help you understand how long it'll take to cook your food compared to using a conventional oven.\n- You've reached the end of the page.

If it's garbage, we'll warn you off.\n- If a product doesn't meet our high standards, we'll tell you why.\n- We'll test products in real life, with a minimum acceptable number of days of testing required before we write our reviews to ensure every product is thoroughly tested.\n- If you think we're not living up to our promise, please email us and we'll endeavor to put it right.\nOur review scoring system\nWe use a familiar five-star scoring system, in order to keep things recognizable and simple: the more stars, the better.\nWe rate our products on a number of criteria depending on the specific attributes of a product type, and we add a score out of 5 for each, for instance:\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nDesign - How does the product look and feel? Is it well-built or cheap to the touch?\nFeatures - Does it have the features and functionality that we expect/want?\nUsability - How easy is it to use and get the most out of? Are the controls in the right place and is the interface logical?\nPerformance - How well does the product work? Do all the features perform as they should?\nValue - Is the launch price a good value when weighed against the other criteria?\nTesting scorecard\nYou'll be able to find a scorecard for all the sections at the end of each review. The scorecard will look similar to the one below, and while these scores help inform our final star rating for a product, they will not always match.\n| Attributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\n| Design | With a sleek, premium style the [EXAMPLE] offers up a design that's in-keeping with the competition, and the price point. | 4/5 |\n| Display | It's simple. This is the best display we've ever tested on a [EXAMPLE]. If screen quality is important to you, look no further. | 5/5 |\n| Performance | Slick and smooth in its operation, the [EXAMPLE] has enough power to keep it competitive, but it doesn't break any new performance barriers | 4/5 |\n| Camera | The [EXAMPLE]'s weakest area is still a solid offering, it just lacks the additional features and pop of color of some rivals | 3/5 |\n| Battery | If you don't like reaching for a charger more than once a day, the [EXAMPLE] has you covered with a solid 1.5 days of battery life | 4.5/5 |\n| Value | For the price, the [EXAMPLE] is packed full of features often found on rivals at a higher price | 4.5/5 |\nOverall review ratings\nOur expert reviewers will take into account the scorecard ratings, as well as the nuances of the individual product to determine its final star rating, which is displayed at the top of the review.\nTechRadar's star rating system is designed to give you a brief indication as to whether we'd recommend the product or not. However, we always advise reading our reviews to learn if a product is right for your particular needs.\nThe final star rating is out of five, and reviewers can award half-star ratings if they feel a product falls between two of the ratings.\nOur review awards\nTechRadar has four product awards:\nEditor's Choice award\nThe Editor's Choice award goes to any product that gets a 5-star TechRadar review in accordance with our reviews guarantee.\nGreat Value award\nThe Great Value award is given to products that represent excellent value for money are thus worthy of consideration. This is not awarded alongside an Editor's Choice or Best in Class award, as excellent value for money is part of the criteria for those awards.\nBest in Class award\nThis award goes to the best product in any major reviews category.\nRecommended award\nA product that scores 4-stars or above is eligible to be considered for the Recommended award. While the product may be lacking in certain areas, it still demonstrates enough quality to be wholeheartedly recommended.\nOur hands-on reviews\nWe headline two different types of article with the word 'review' - 'hands-on reviews' and 'full product reviews.' It is important to distinguish between them.\nHands-on reviews are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours.\nThe important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.\nWe use the word 'review' here partly because we are giving a real opinion based on using it, and partly because readers increasingly use the word 'review' in searches when looking for these early views about a product.\nHowever, hands-on reviews are not the same as full product reviews. Our full product reviews are always based on the finished release product, which has been thoroughly tested and benchmarked and will always contain a full verdict and score.\nOur reviewers\nOur reviewers are specialists, each with expertise in a particular technology. With decades of combined experience reviewing technology under their belts, our team has consistently lived, breathed, and reviewed technology since TechRadar's conception in 2007.\nOur US Editor-in-Chief, Lance Ulanoff, has more than 30 years of experience as a technology journalist at a number of high-profile outlets, including Mashable and PCMag, and UK Editor-in-Chief Marc McLaren has more than 20 years of tech publishing experience on sites that include Tom's Guide and Stuff.\nHowever, that just scratches the surface of a diverse and far-reaching global team that spans four continents, 14 countries, and 11 different languages.\nThe result is a team with an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the areas they cover, ensuring our reviews not only give you an in-depth experience of each product but also the vital wider context, providing you with the exact information you need when it comes to making a buying decision.\nSpecialist expertise\nBecause our writers are specialists, they are constantly in touch with the communities they report on. That means our experts are able to rate products against others of the same type.\nTechRadar commissions our reviews only from those with the requisite level of expertise: from our own team of writers to other external experts when needed.\nWhat this means is if you see a review of a home theater system on TechRadar, you know it's been reviewed by an expert in home theater, not mobile phones.\nHow we test\nWe emphasize real world testing over labs, because that's where products get used. However, we benchmark every product that sells on the basis of specific performance indicators.\nFind out more about our testing procedures:"

No s\u00f3lo que cocinan m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido que un horno convencional al no necesitar precalentado y ser m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os, si no tambi\u00e9n porque se usa menos aceite y porque tambi\u00e9n permiten usarse para calentar comida y as\u00ed prescindir de un microondas.\nEsta freidora tiene algo que me ha gustado y es que tiene una \u00fanica cesta y es bastante grande (7,2L.) porque la mayor\u00eda suelen tener dos, una de cada tama\u00f1o, de modo que si vas a cocinar para varias personas tienes que usar las dos cestas al mismo tiempo y es m\u00e1s l\u00edo preparar la comida. En \u00e9sta si quieres pones menos cantidad y un programa m\u00e1s corto.\nHablando de programas, trae 7 preestablecidos que se indican con un dibujo. Es bastante directa de usar en ese sentido. Por supuesto son programas recomendados pero luego ya depende de cada caso en concreto y de c\u00f3mo nos guste la comida (si m\u00e1s o menos hecha) y del estado de los ingredientes (si utilizamos productos frescos, congelados, del tiempo...). Pero en general s\u00ed que he notado que cocina mucho m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido que un horno normal y calienta algunas cosas casi tan r\u00e1pido como un microondas.\nOtro detalle que me ha gustado es que la cesta tiene una ventana y dentro tiene una luz para poder ver el estado de la comida durante el proceso, algo que es t\u00edpico en los hornos y microondas pero que no he visto en muchas otras freidoras en las que tienes que estar sacando y metiendo la cesta hasta que le coges el rollo a los tiempo.\nPara limpiarla, hay que sacar la cesta y lavarla, lo cual es c\u00f3modo, pero tambi\u00e9n hay que limpiar el interior como si de un horno se tratase. Lo que pasa es que es algo que se hace bastante r\u00e1pido por la capacidad que tiene. Yo uso unos moldes de silicona que se ponen en el interior de la cesta y que son mucho m\u00e1s maleables y f\u00e1ciles de lavar. Tambi\u00e9n hay unas rejillas que se colocan encima de la cesta para que no salpique tanto. No las he probado pero dicen que se notan mucho.\nCreo que, para personas que suelan cocinar en horno, es un gran producto y tiene un precio muy ajustado por lo que ofrece y la calidad que tiene. Por supuesto, hay modelos con muchas m\u00e1s opciones pero tambi\u00e9n son m\u00e1s caros. Y, si realmente lo que quieres es una airfryer familiar pero que no sea excesivamente grande, que caliente bien y se limpie f\u00e1cilmente, merece mucho la pena.\n-\nChrisTestDummyReviewed in the Netherlands on 11 July 2025\n5.0 out of 5 stars Praktisch en ruim voor een groot gezin\nTijdens de verbouwing van onze keuken moesten we even improviseren met koken. We leenden een airfryer van een kennis en die heeft onze mening compleet omgegooid. Eerst waren we best kritisch; zo'n airfryer leek ons gewoon een kleine oven, dus waarom zou je 'm willen als je al een heteluchtoven hebt? Maar hoewel het een simpel ding was met alleen een draaiknop voor temperatuur en een timer, liet ons al snel zien hoe handig zo'n apparaat is. Hij was supersnel warm, je bakte er perfecte broodjes in en de frietjes waren echt veel lekkerder dan uit de oven.\nNa de verbouwing besloten we zelf een airfryer te kopen, en we kozen voor de Bosch Airfryer. Met een gezin van vijf is een ruime mand handig zodat je niet in meerdere porties moet gaan koken. En deze Airfryer heeft die zeker. Schoonmaken is makkelijk dankzij het uitneembare bodemrooster. Qua geluid is hij best stil, zeker vergeleken met die geleende, al hoor je 'm wel als hij aanstaat. Maar voor ons niet storend.\nDe voorgeprogrammeerde standen op de airfryer regelen vooral de tijd en temperatuur, wat handig is, maar niet echt vernieuwend. Wat wel super praktisch is, is het lampje aan de binnenkant. Zo hoef je de lade niet steeds open te trekken om te zien of je patatjes al klaar zijn en dat voorkomt veel warmteverlies en gedoe.\nTijdens het gebruik zijn ons een paar kleine dingen opgevallen die hem net iets minder perfect maken:\nIn het begin ging de lade best stroef open. Ik trok bijna het hele apparaat van het aanrecht maar ik heb nu een trucje: ik zet mijn duim tegen de voorkant en trek de lade met mijn andere vingers open. Dat werkt wel maar dan zit mijn duim precies op de aan/uit-knop, waardoor de airfryer soms per ongeluk uitgaat. Ik denk dat het een kwestie van wennen is, of misschien moet je de lade gewoon met twee handen opentrekken. Maar als ik aan het koken ben heb ik vaak iets in mijn hand of is een hand vies van ander snijwerk.\nEen ander gek ding is dat de Airfryer automatisch aangaat als je de lade terugplaatst nadat je 'm hebt schoongemaakt en hij is afgekoeld. Ik snap dat dat soms handig kan zijn als je meteen verder wilt, maar als je net klaar bent met schoonmaken, is het een beetje vreemd dat hij dan alweer aanspringt. Geen groot probleem, je drukt hem ook zo weer uit.\nConclusie: Ondanks deze kleine dingetjes is de Bosch Airfryer een erg fijn en effici\u00ebnt apparaat. De grote inhoud, het gemak en het relatief lage geluidsniveau maken hem geschikt voor gezinnen. Hij voldoet zeker aan onze verwachtingen.\n-\nHediaReviewed in France on 24 July 2025\n5.0 out of 5 stars Au top\nAu top ni trop petit ni trop grand, suffisant pour 2 personnes.
