      "feedback": "World-class upgrade: tighten the piece into a single, testable 0–3 week chain with explicit catalysts, thresholds, and invalidations, anchored to the five sources; start with a clear thesis: near-term price and financing headwinds (tariff pass‑through on Japanese autos, 15% vs 27.5%) plus tighter consumer credit will keep discretionary demand and auto trade-ins under pressure, even as automakers publicly deny tariff‑driven price hikes (S15934PBQ; CDBMWIUTB); then lay out a causal flow: tariff costs push auto prices higher and NA profitability for Toyota slips to a $-438m offset by a $5.8b overall quarterly profit elsewhere, signaling regional margin stress (S15934PBQ); financing costs persist (6.43% average new-car loan rate in March 2024) tightening affordability and sustaining negative equity and trade‑in frictions (CDBMWIUTB); depreciation dynamics amplify trade‑in risk, especially in EVs and luxury segments (CDBMWIUTB; S15934PBQ); add cross‑asset reads: Vegas discretionary spend slump as a near‑term proxy for consumer caution (6OOEK8TUR); housing‑policy friction evidenced by Bethel’s 8‑30g exposure and a 75‑unit project with ~5% affordable stock and ~$582k–$583k median prices (F8GF45MEU); and macro policy risk via Lagarde’s central‑bank independence argument framed against Powell/Jackson Hole context (U6HXAJR4J); ensure to reconcile conflicts by highlighting the dual narratives: tariffs are cited as price pressures by data (Nikkei/WSJ/Nascent auto price signals) while corporate statements deny direct causation; specify monitoring triggers: next auto price index data, tariff announcements, and Jackson Hole/policy commentary (U6HXAJR4J); track 8‑30g milestones and Bethel litigation as near‑term inflection points for regional risk premia; define key thresholds to watch as: if NA auto profitability improves and US auto prices stop rising despite tariff relief, the thesis weakens; if tariff pass‑through persists or accelerates alongside 6–8 bps of rate uncertainty, downside for autos and consumer discretionary remains; and if 8‑30g litigation escalates in Bethel, risk signals rise for regional real estate names.
