  "description": "What makes Bone Flute especially powerful is the way it invites readers in.",
  "content": "Some books do not need to shout to be heard. They speak quietly and clearly, with a kind of wisdom that lingers. Bone Flute: A Woman Speaks is one of those rare collections that opens a space for readers to breathe, observe, and remember what matters. It is not interested in spectacle. Instead, it pays attention to small joys, fleeting thoughts, family bonds, the rhythm of days. And in that attention, it finds something close to magic.\n\nThis poetry collection was not written for a spotlight. It grew over time, poem by poem, across twenty-five years of reflection and daily writing. The result is a body of work that feels deeply lived-in. The voice that emerges is clear, curious, wry, and endlessly generous.\n\nWhat makes Bone Flute especially powerful is the way it invites readers in. These poems speak plainly but precisely, with images that feel both familiar and unexpectedly tender. Whether describing a memory, a moment in the garden, or a scrap of conversation, the poems create the feeling of sitting across from someone who knows how to listen.\n\nThe Shape of the Book\n\nIrene Adler spent more than two decades writing over two thousand poems: quiet, deliberate reflections gathered from her daily life. She didn\u2019t write for acclaim. She wrote because it grounded her. After years of exchanging drafts and sharing poems with close friend and poet Angela Narciso Torres, Adler\u2019s body of work took on new form.\n\nFollowing Irene\u2019s vision, Torres, together with poets Gail Goepfert, Naoko Fujimoto, and Timothy Torres, shaped a manuscript that honored the emotional range and subtlety of her writing. The result is a collection that moves with grace between wonder and restraint, clarity and curiosity, always in Adler\u2019s unmistakable voice.\n\nThe book is structured like a quiet conversation. Nan Cohen, who wrote the foreword, describes the poems as \u201ctraveling through the seasons of her life,\u201d but more than that, they feel like steady footfalls on a familiar path. One poem may recall a kitchen moment with a loved one; the next may hold a small observation about birdsong or the feel of the morning light. The tone is calm, but never distant.\n\nThere is also delight in the ordinary. Adler\u2019s poems are filled with the texture of daily life, meals, gardens, handwritten notes, glances exchanged. Her humor comes in flashes, never loud but always welcome. Poet Robin Ekiss calls the work \u201cpragmatic, patient, and wily.\u201d These acknowledge how much life is packed into a few short lines.\n\nRather than searching for drama, Bone Flute leans into the quiet marvels of everyday experience. The natural world makes frequent appearances: owls, beetles, birds, and blossoms populate the pages, not as metaphors, but as companions in observation. The poems do not press meaning onto these creatures. They simply notice and in that noticing, something opens.\n\nThere is a poem about tulips that captures this perfectly. Their presence becomes a brief, joyous interruption. The kind of thing you might smile at on a walk, then remember days later without knowing why. This is how Adler\u2019s poems work: they plant themselves gently and grow in your thoughts.\n\nRelationships play a central role throughout the collection. There are quiet portraits of sisterhood, family ties, long marriages, enduring friendships. Adler writes about her loved ones with honesty and kindness. Her poems share a remembered conversation, a habit passed down, a joke between siblings, all become material for reflection and quiet celebration.\n\nThe poems also have a gentle pace, an awareness of time that comes from years of paying attention. There is joy in routine, in the cycles of planting and harvesting, in the rhythm of writing each day. This is not nostalgia, rather the kind of clarity that arrives when someone has learned to live deeply in their own life.\n\nThe Woman Behind the Voice\n\nIrene Adler, the woman behind Bone Flute, didn\u2019t begin publishing poetry in her early years. For fifteen years, she taught English, and for many more, she was a wife, mother, friend, and observer of the world. She began writing poems seriously later in life, as a personal commitment, a daily practice to stay connected to language, emotion, and reflection. Over time, this practice filled notebooks and folders with poems that captured decades of thought and feeling.\n\nHer husband, Alan Adler, supported the project from the beginning. Their marriage lasted sixty-one years, and it is clear that his encouragement was part of the soil from which the poems grew. After her passing, he helped bring the book to life, donating all proceeds to Stanford Medicine\u2019s cancer research and endowing a chair in her name. The book is part tribute, part living document of the life they shared and the ideas she cared about.\n\nThe editorial team, many of whom had shared poems with Adler over the years, speak of her with affection and admiration. She wasn\u2019t writing for fame. She wrote to be present. Her voice was not crafted for the page, it was lived into the page. That is why the collection feels so natural and intimate.\n\nBone Flute invites people to slow down. To listen, to notice, and in doing so, it offers something rare: a feeling of connection that doesn\u2019t demand anything in return.\n\nThe title itself is perfectly chosen. A bone flute is one of the oldest instruments known to humankind. It is simple, hand-carved, made to carry sound softly across time. Adler\u2019s poetry carries that same spirit: crafted with care, made from what life offered, and resonant in a way that does not fade.\n\nThis is a book that rewards returning, the kind of book you leave on a nightstand, revisit in a quiet moment, share with someone you care about. There\u2019s comfort in these poems. Not because they are sweet or safe, but because they tell the truth gently. They are a reminder that attention is a kind of love.",

      "text": "Bone Flute: A Woman Speaks\nIRENE ADLER\nPoetry\nEdited by Angela Narciso Torres\n\u201cIt\u2019s been my great honor and privilege to serve as the courier for Irene\u2019s windblown letter to the world. I can think of no higher tribute to a fellow sojourner in poetry and in life. I am certain that, like the bone flute, these poems will continue to sing throughout the ages.\u201d\n\u2014Angela Narciso Torres, author of What Happens Is Neither\nISBN: 9781734496529\nLCCN: 2025930594\nCover Art: Kai Jiang\nPaper | 6 x 9 | 136 pages\nPublication Date: April 29, 2025\nList Price: $20 (price may vary by retailer)\nPress Release\nBook Release Posthumously Honors the Legacy of Los Altos Poet and Philanthropist Irene Adler\nSan Mateo, Ca., 29 April 2025 \u2014 In a tribute to the enduring power of poetry, Paloma Press is pleased to announce the posthumous release of Bone Flute: A Woman Speaks, a collection of lyrical poems by Irene Adler. Edited by award-winning poet Angela Narciso Torres, Bone Flute provides a longitudinal poetic record of American life and womanhood echoing Linda Pastan, Mona Van Duyn, and Grace Paley.\n\u201cAfter a career of teaching English for about 15 years, Irene began writing every day. I loved it and was her devoted cheerleader. She often wrote about something she encountered in her life,\u201d recalls Alan Adler, Irene\u2019s husband of 61 years and inventor of the Aerobie flying ring and the Aeropress coffee maker. Irene was also a philanthropist and contributed substantial funds to support cancer research at Stanford University. After Irene passed away in October 2023, Alan endowed a chair at Stanford Medicine in her name. In addition to making a difference in the lives of countless cancer patients, Irene left behind over 2,000 unpublished poems written over 25 years. \u201cNow that we have Bone Flute,\u201d Alan continues, \u201cI\u2019m eager to expose the world to Irene\u2019s wonderful poetry. Royalties will go to the Cancer Research at Stanford University as Irene wished. I intend to do all that can be done to share this book with the world.\u201d\nMany hands helped bring Bone Flute to life. Angela Narciso Torres, Irene\u2019s friend of more than 20 years, formed an editorial committee made up of fellow poets Gail Goepfert, Naoko Fujimoto, and Timothy Torres. The book features a Foreword by Nan Cohen, and advance words by Sally Ashton, Robin Ekiss, Peter Kline, and Cintia Santana, all of whom knew Irene. The family and friends of Irene Adler, in association with Paloma Press, are organizing readings to celebrate the book\u2019s release. Bone Flute: A Woman Speaks is available April 29, 2025 through leading online retailers and booksellers. Coverage of the book has appeared in the Redwood City Pulse, The Almanac, Mountain View Voice, Palo Alto Weekly, and Los Altos Crier.\nSynopsis\nInspired by Bishop and Dickinson, Bone Flute: A Woman Speaks by Irene Adler gives equal voice to the unspeakable sorrows and wonders of being alive. Edited by award-winning poet Angela Narciso Torres, this posthumous collection provides a longitudinal poetic record of American life and womanhood echoing Linda Pastan, Mona Van Duyn, and Grace Paley.\nPraise\n\u201cReading Bone Flute, we travel with the poet through the seasons of her life, moving through history, through memory, through geography, and yet with a powerful sense of immediacy. I feel certain that there are poems here . . . that will survive the way poems do, lodged like a tough plant in a crack in someone\u2019s heart.\u201d\n\u2014from the foreword by Nan Cohen, author of Unfinished City\n\u201c\u2019We leave things at a wild velocity,\u2019 poet Irene Adler writes in Bone Flute, her moving, posthumous collection. In poems that demonstrate an equal tenderness toward life and loss, Adler celebrates the small but profound joys that make any life a miracle in spite of suffering, \u2018black clouds fringed silver.\u2019 Here, love and sorrow walk hand in hand. Such poems are like a bone flute, one that plays \u2018notes that made a bleak night shine,\u2019 notes that continue to echo and shimmer in our memory and in the poems found here. Adler plays a fine, sweet music you won\u2019t want to miss.\u201d\n\u2014Sally Ashton, author of Listening to Mars\n\u201cIrene Adler\u2019s poems are pragmatic, patient, and wily, defiant in their desire for forgiveness and forbearance. With a stark, self-reflexive beauty both airy and earth-bound, Irene\u2019s small and sacred meditations reveal what the owls, birds, and beetles already know: life\u2019s \u2018wild velocity\u2019 lives in every \u2018quill, bone, and feather.\u2019 As a sister, daughter, and mother, these poems that \u2018sing with delight/for secret reasons\u2019 will live in me for a long time.\u201d\n\u2014Robin Ekiss, author of The Mansion of Happiness\n\u201cIn this passionate, moving collection, Irene Adler distills a lifetime of asking the big questions into slender lyrics shimmering with longing, grief, and awe. With a delicate sense of music, these poems explore themes of romantic love, familial bonds and trauma, childhood and coming of age, the natural world, and intimations of the divine. In \u2018Genesis,\u2019 after laying out an alternate cosmology, Adler writes in a line both wry and uncanny, \u2018In the beginning, even God was green.\u2019 Cleaning voracious pests from her grandmother\u2019s garden, her speaker sees not devastation but a vision of ecstasy: \u2018We might all be drowning in roses.\u2019 The deepest subject of the book is mortality, both that of the speaker and of those she loves, a subject she treats with unsentimental bravery, as in this terse advice from \u2018Heading Home\u2019: \u2018leave this life more lightly than / you came and make swift goodbyes.\u2019 Bone Flute is a wise testament to the pain and wonder of being human.\u201d\n\u2014Peter Kline, author of Mirrorforms\n\u201cBone Flute is a testament to the elegance of the word. Smooth-seeming are the waters into which Irene Adler\u2019s words cleanly dive. Through an ease with music and form\u2014from tankas to sonnets\u2014Adler brings a pianist\u2019s sensibilities to the page. Her unswerving observations of our human plight surface and surprise again and again: from the humorous (\u2018Above the poet\u2019s voice a cry of geese / in flight adds honking to her sonnet.\u2019) to the marvelous, through which grief and human desire (\u2018we covet in colors.\u2019) entwine and complicate.\u201d\n\u2014Cintia Santana, author of The Disordered Alphabet\nBook Trailer\nPress Kit\nVirtual Book Launch\nAbout the Author\nAbout the Author\nIrene Adler was a poet and English teacher in Palo Alto, California where she was also a co-owner of the company that invented the Aerobie flying ring and the Aeropress coffee maker.
