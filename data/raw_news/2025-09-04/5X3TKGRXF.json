  "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nA team of computer scientists at the University of Toronto recently discovered that a certain type of hardware attack is effective against graphics processing units (GPUs), the core computing engines that power today's artificial intelligence models and cloud-based machine learning services.\n\nThe researchers found that a Rowhammer attack, previously known to affect the memory in central processing units (CPUs), is also effective against GPUs equipped with graphics double data rate (GDDR) memory. GDDR is designed for high-speed data transfer and is commonly found in graphics cards.\n\nA successful attack on GPUs running AI models could result in \"catastrophic brain damage\" with model accuracy plummeting from 80% to just 0.1%, says Gururaj Saileshwar, an assistant professor in the department of computer science in the Faculty of Arts & Science.\n\nSuch degradation could have serious consequences for AI applications that depend on those models\u2014from medical imaging analysis in hospitals to fraud detection systems in banks.\n\nIn a Rowhammer attack, memory cells are manipulated into flipping bits\u2014tiny pieces of data\u2014by rapidly accessing adjacent rows of cells over and over. This causes electrical interference that leads to errors in memory regions the attacker hasn't directly accessed, potentially allowing them to bypass security or take control of a system.\n\n\"Traditionally, security has been thought of at the software layer, but we're increasingly seeing physical effects at the hardware layer that can be leveraged as vulnerabilities,\" says Saileshwar, who is cross-appointed to the Edward S. Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering.\n\nWorking with second-year computer science Ph.D. student Chris (Shaopeng) Lin and fourth-year computer science undergraduate student Joyce Qu, Saileshwar developed a proof-of-concept GPUHammer attack targeting the GDDR6 memory in an NVIDIA RTX A6000, a GPU widely used for high-performance computing. They discovered that a single bit flip to alter the exponent of an AI model's weight could cause a massive reduction in the model's accuracy.\n\n\"This introduces a new way AI models can fail at the hardware level,\" said Saileshwar, who co-authored a paper with Lin and Qu that was accepted to USENIX Security Symposium 2025, held August 13\u201315 in Seattle.\n\nThe GPU users most at risk are those managing cloud computing environments\u2014not individual home or office users. In cloud settings, multiple users may access the same GPU simultaneously, allowing an attacker to tamper with another user's data processing.\n\nSaileshwar notes that the researchers had to account for key differences between CPU and GPU memory. GPUs are more difficult to target due to their faster memory refresh rates, slower memory latency and other architectural differences. Ultimately, the researchers leveraged GPU parallelism\u2014its ability to run multiple operations simultaneously\u2014to optimize their hammering patterns. This adjustment led to the bit flips that demonstrated a successful attack.\n\nIt wasn't easy. \"Hammering on GPUs is like hammering blind,\" Saileshwar says, noting that the team nearly gave up after repeated failures to trigger any bit flips.\n\nOn CPUs, researchers can use tools to inspect the memory interface and understand how memory accesses behave and how instructions are sent from the CPU to memory. But because GPU memory chips are soldered directly onto the GPU board, there's no easy way to perform similar inspections, Saileshwar says. The only signal the team observed was the eventual bit flips.\n\nEarlier this year, the researchers privately disclosed their findings to GPU giant NVIDIA\u2014now the most valuable company in the world. In July, the U.S. company issued a security notice to its customers.\n\nNVIDIA's suggested remedy is to enable a feature called error correction code (ECC), which can repel a GPUHammer attack. However, the researchers found that the remedy slows down machine learning tasks by up to 10%. They also warned that future attacks involving more bit flips might be able to overwhelm even the ECC protections.\n\nThe findings underscore the need for increased attention to GPU security\u2014an area where Saileshwar says work is \"just beginning.\"\n\n\"More investigation will probably reveal more issues. And that's important, because we're running incredibly valuable workloads on GPUs. AI models are being used in real-world settings like health care, finance and cybersecurity. If there are vulnerabilities that allow attackers to tamper with those models at the hardware level, we need to find them before they're exploited.\"",

      "text": "GPUHammer: Rowhammer Attacks on GPU Memories are Practical #\nChris (Shaopeng) Lin\u2020, Joyce Qu\u2020, Gururaj Saileshwar, from University of Toronto\nPublished at USENIX Security 2025 (link to paper). Artifact available on GitHub and Zenodo. \u2020 equal contribution\nTL;DR #\nGPUHammer is the first attack to show Rowhammer bit flips on GPU memories, specifically on a GDDR6 memory in an NVIDIA A6000 GPU. Our attacks induce bit flips across all tested DRAM banks, despite in-DRAM defenses like TRR, using user-level CUDA code. These bit flips allow a malicious GPU user to tamper with another user\u2019s data on the GPU in shared, time-sliced environments. In a proof-of-concept, we use these bit flips to tamper with a victim\u2019s DNN models and degrade model accuracy from 80% to 0.1%, using a single bit flip. Enabling Error Correction Codes (ECC) can mitigate this risk, but ECC can introduce up to a 10% slowdown for ML inference workloads on an A6000 GPU.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Response: Security Notice: Rowhammer - July 2025\nMedia Coverage: Ars Technica, Tom\u2019s Hardware, The Register, The Mashable, TechRadar, The Hacker News, BleepingComputer, SecurityWeek, Cyber Security News, SC Media, Fudzilla, SDXCentral, PC Perspective, Cyber Press, GBHackers, ITNews, WCCFTech, Security Brief Australia, Red Hot Cyber\n\ud83d\udd0d What\u2019s New in Rowhammer for GPUs? #\nRowhammer is a hardware vulnerability where rapidly activating a memory row introduces bit flips in adjacent memory rows. Since 2014, this vulnerability has been widely studied in CPUs and in CPU-based memories like DDR3, DDR4, and LPDDR4. However, with critical AI and ML workloads now running on discrete GPUs in the cloud, it is vital to assess the vulnerability of GPU memories to Rowhammer attacks.\nRowhammer is uniquely more challenging on GPU-based GDDR memories for the following reasons:\n- \u23f1\ufe0f GDDR6 has higher latency and faster refresh than CPU-based DDR4, making hammering harder.\n- \ud83e\udde9 Unknown DRAM address mappings in GDDR memories complicate crafting effective patterns.\n- \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In-DRAM mitigations in GDDR are opaque and undocumented.\nDespite this, GPUHammer overcomes these barriers and launches successful attacks on GDDR6.\nStep 1: Reverse Engineering GPU DRAM Mappings #\nTo craft effective Rowhammer attacks, we first need to identify memory addresses that map to the same DRAM bank on an NVIDIA GPU. Unlike CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs do not expose the physical addresses to user-level CUDA code, making it challenging to identify and hammer DRAM rows in the same bank. However, observing that the NVIDIA GPU driver consistently maps virtual memory to the same physical memory, we reverse engineer the virtual memory offsets to DRAM bank mappings. Inspired by the DRAMA technique, we use timing differences between memory accesses to the same bank vs. different banks.\nOne key obstacle, as shown in Fig. 1, is the Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) effect in memory access latencies for addresses accessed in pairs, which makes it hard to pinpoint same-bank addresses. Based on the insight that addresses in the same DRAM bank must have similar latency when accessed in isolation, we filter out such addresses contributing to the NUMA effects and clearly identify addresses mapping to the same DRAM bank (see Fig. 2). This accurately identifies same-bank address pairs needed for crafting Rowhammer patterns.\nFig. 1: Naively accessing pairs of addresses: different-bank latencies (320-370ns) overlap with same-bank latencies (370-380ns) due to NUMA effects. |\nFig 2: After filtering addresses with different latencies when accessed in isolation, same and different bank address pairs are distinguishable. |\n|---|---|\nStep-2: Maximizing Hammering Intensity #\nGPU memory accesses are up to 4\u00d7 slower slower than CPUs, making it hard to reach the activation rate needed for Rowhammer attacks using naive, single-threaded hammering like in CPUs (Fig. 3, green line). To overcome this, we exploit the GPU\u2019s SIMT parallelism, launching multiple threads and warps in parallel. This multi-threaded, multi-warp approach (Fig. 3, orange line) eliminates idle time in the memory controller and reaches the maximum possible hammering rate. Fig. 4 shows how these strategies maximize memory controller utilization.\nFig. 3: Number of activations in a single refresh period (tREFW) for single-thread, multi-thread, and multi-warp hammering. |\n|---|\nFig. 4: Memory controller utilization with (a) single-thread, (b) multi-thread, and (c) multi-warp hammering. Multi-warp hammering minimizes idle time, maximizing activation rates.\nStep-3: Synchronizing to Refreshes, Defeating Mitigations #\nPrior works like SMASH and BlackSmith show that synchronizing hammering to refreshes (REF) is key to bypassing in-DRAM defenses.\nHowever, CUDA\u2019s synchronization primitives (like __syncthreads()\n) used to synchronize threads can reorder warp execution. Instead, we use implicit per-warp delays, aligned such that REF commands overlap with our inserted delays, to align our hammering with refreshes and defeat in-DRAM mitigations like TRR while preserving warp execution order.\nFig. 5: Per-warp delays inserted using adds\nfor synchronizing\nto REF. When the delays overlap, the REF\nis inserted in alignment with the hammering pattern.\n\ud83d\udca5 What Did We Break? #\nWe ran GPUHammer on an NVIDIA RTX A6000 (48 GB GDDR6) across four DRAM banks and observed 8 distinct single-bit flips, and bit-flips across all tested banks (see Fig. 6). The minimum activation count ( TRH) to induce a flip was ~12K, consistent with prior DDR4 findings.\nUsing these flips, we performed the first ML accuracy degradation attack using Rowhammer on a GPU. Prior work shows that flipping the most significant bit of a floating-point exponent in FP16 model weights can drastically reduce model accuracy. Based on this insight, we show that in a time-shared GPU setup, an attacker can position victim data into vulnerable DRAM rows via memory massaging and force the bit flips at such locations.\nIn our proof-of-concept (Fig. 7), with just a single bit flip, the accuracy of an ML model is degraded below 1% for all five tested ImageNet DNN models, resulting in up to 80% accuracy loss.\nFig. 6: Number of bit-flips in 4 banks on RTX A6000 with GDDR6. We observed bit-flips on each bank. |\nFig. 7: Accuracy degradation attack on ImageNet models on NVIDIA A6000 GPU. We report the top-1 / top-5 accuracy without (Base Acc) and with (Degraded Acc) the bit-flip, and the Relative Accuracy Drop (RAD) for the top-1 accuracy. |\n|---|---|\n\u2753 FAQs #\nWhat GPUs are vulnerable? Am I affected? #\nWe confirmed Rowhammer bit flips on NVIDIA A6000 GPUs with GDDR6 memory. Other GDDR6 GPUs, such as the RTX 3080, did not show bit flips in our tests, possibly due to variations in DRAM vendor, chip characteristics, or operating conditions like temperature. We also observed no flips on an A100 GPU with HBM memory.\nWhy test so few GPUs? Isn\u2019t that a small sample size? #\nUnlike CPUs, where DRAM modules can be easily swapped out for testing, GPU DRAM is soldered in, making large-scale testing expensive (GPUs can cost thousands of dollars). Our attack code is extensible to other Ampere GPUs and beyond, and we encourage future work to expand the test coverage.\nHow can GPUHammer be mitigated? #\nAdmins can mitigate GPUHammer by enabling ECC via nvidia-smi -e 1\n(followed by a reboot). All observed bit flips so far are single-bit, which ECC can correct. However, enabling ECC may reduce performance by up to 10% and memory capacity by 6.25% on the A6000. Still, this doesn\u2019t eliminate the root cause, a hardware flaw, which would require redesigning GDDR6 with principled mitigations like PRAC, which has been proposed for DDR5 and beyond, or probabilistic mitigations like PRIDE.\nAre newer GPUs like the H100 or RTX 5090 affected? #\nCurrently, no. H100 (HBM3) and RTX 5090 (GDDR7) feature on-die ECC, which likely masks single-bit flips. However, future Rowhammer patterns causing multi-bit flips may bypass such ECC, as shown in attacks like ECCploit.\nDid you disclose this to NVIDIA? What was their response? #\nYes. We responsibly disclosed GPUHammer to NVIDIA on January 15, 2025, and also to major cloud service providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.). NVIDIA confirmed the issue and recommended enabling ECC as a mitigation.\nFurther Information #\nPlease refer to our paper, which appears at USENIX Security 2025.

      "text": "Details\nNVIDIA has received new research related to the industry-wide DRAM issue known as \u201cRowhammer\u201d. The research demonstrates a potential Rowhammer attack against an NVIDIA A6000 GPU with GDDR6 Memory. The purpose of this notice is to reinforce already known mitigations to Rowhammer attacks.\nBackground\nModern DRAMs, including the ones used by NVIDIA, are potentially susceptible to Rowhammer. The now decade-old Rowhammer problem has been well known for CPU memories (e.g., DDR, LPDDR). Recently, researchers at the University of Toronto demonstrated a successful Rowhammer exploitation on a NVIDIA A6000 GPU with GDDR6 memory where System-Level ECC was not enabled. In the same paper, the researchers showed that enabling System-Level ECC mitigates the Rowhammer problem.\nMitigation\nNVIDIA GPU and SoC products include memory controllers designed to meet current industry standards for GDDR, LPDDR, and HBM specifications. Risk of successful exploitation from Rowhammer attacks varies based on DRAM device, platform, design specification, and system settings.\nNVIDIA continues to recommend the following existing DRAM mitigations to prevent or lessen the likelihood of Rowhammer attacks including:\nEnsuring System level ECC is enabled across the following NVIDIA products (see \u201cEnabling SYS-ECC\u201d below):\nBlackwell\nData Center: NVIDIA HGX, DGX series (GB200, B200, B100)\nWorkstation: NVIDIA RTX PRO series\nAda\nData Center: NVIDIA L40S, L40, L4\nWorkstation: NVIDIA RTX 6000, 5000, 4500, 4000, 4000 SFF, 2000\nHopper\nData Center: NVIDIA HGX, DGX series (H100, H200, GH200, H20, H800)\nAmpere\nData Center: NVIDIA A100, A40, A30, A16, A10, A2, A800\nWorkstation: NVIDIA RTX A6000, A5000, A4500, A4000, A2000, A1000, A400\nJetson\nJetson AGX Orin Industrial\nIGX Orin\nTuring\nData Center: NVIDIA T1000, T600, T400, T4\nWorkstation: NVIDIA RTX 8000, RTX 6000, RTX 5000, RTX 4000\nVolta\nData Center/HPC: Tesla V100, Tesla V100S\nWorkstation: Workstation: Quadro GV100\nSpecific generations of DRAM devices starting with DDR4, LPDDR5, HBM3 and GDDR7 implement On-Die ECC (OD-ECC) to help with DRAM scaling. OD-ECC indirectly provides protection against Rowhammer bit flips. Note: OD-ECC is not adjustable by users. If OD-ECC is present, it is always enabled. The following NVIDIA products support OD-ECC:\nBlackwell\nGeForce: RTX 50 series\nData Center: NVIDIA HGX, DGX series (GB200, B200, B100)\nWorkstation: NVIDIA RTX PRO\u2122 series\nHopper\nData Center: H100, H200, H20, GH200\nFor enterprise customer environments that require enhanced levels of assurance and integrity, NVIDIA recommends using professional and Data Center products (instead of consumer-grade graphics hardware) and ensuring that ECC is enabled to prevent Rowhammer-style attacks. This is enabled by default on the Hopper and Blackwell Data Center class of GPUs.\nSingle versus Multi-tenant GPU tenancy should be considered when assessing the risk. Simultaneous access to the GPU is required to execute a Rowhammer attack between tenants.\nEnabling SYS-ECC\nEnabling SYS-ECC varies across platform types and in the case of Hopper and Blackwell Data Center products is already enabled by default. Generally, there are two paths for checking and setting SYS-ECC with NVIDIA Data Center Products:\nOut-of-Band (OOB) - via the system BMC to the GPU\nIn-Band (InB) - via the system CPU to the GPU\nWith these paths, there are several options for checking and setting SYS-ECC.
