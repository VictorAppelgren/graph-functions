  "content": "The best outdoor rugs are both practical and stylish, enhancing your outdoor space while offering comfort and heat protection. Finding the right one can be daunting, as you need to consider style, durability and comfort all at once. In 2025, our top pick is Frontgate\u2019s Britta Indoor/Outdoor Rug, which features UV protection and stain resistance that\u2019s designed to last for many al fresco dinners to come.\n\n\u201cOutdoor rugs can inject color, pattern and texture, which can elevate the aesthetic and vibe,\u201d says Jennifer Jones, principal designer at Niche Interiors. \u201cIt also shields hardscape from overheating in direct sunlight and as a result, it can protect bare feet during hot weather months.\u201d Read on for our top picks of the best outdoor rugs to elevate your backyard in 2025.\n\nThe home team at Forbes Vetted is dedicated to providing the very best recommendations for your home. We\u2019ve extensively tested and reviewed a myriad of outdoor products, from outdoor sectionals to patio umbrellas.\n\u2022 Monica Petrucci is the author of this article and a commerce writer covering home topics at Forbes Vetted. She has tested and reviewed hundreds of products over the years, from pressure washers to flat-top grills.\n\u2022 We interviewed Jennifer Jones for this article, founder and principal designer at Niche Interiors. Jones provided insight on the benefit of outdoor rugs, how to take care of them and which materials to prioritize for longevity.\n\u2022 The Forbes Vetted team is committed to providing only the most relevant information to our readers, performing regular article updates as needed. This article was last updated in August 2025.\n\nHow We Chose The Best Outdoor Rugs\n\nWe evaluated several of the top picks at popular retailers, comparing design elements, specs and customization options to deliver a comprehensive list of the best outdoor rugs.\n\u2022 We took expert recommendations from Jones to help shape our decision-making process, prioritizing rugs made from her recommended materials and with tighter woven fabric.\n\u2022 A great outdoor rug is defined by its durability, so we looked for features like UV-resistant and mold-resistant finishes in order to recommend rugs designed to maintain their structure\u2014both in rain and shine.\n\u2022 We scoured through consumer reviews, looking out for any common issues reported over months and years, and making note of minor issues that consumers should consider.\n\u2022 We took owner feedback into account, including rugs only with a 4.5-star rating or higher.\n\nWhat To Look For In The Best Outdoor Rugs\n\nInvesting in an outdoor rug to transform your patio or deck aesthetic is a big decision. Luckily, there are some key features to keep in mind to help you make the right choice.\n\nJones recommends opting for a synthetic fiber when shopping for an outdoor rug, like polypropylene, polyester and nylon. \u201cThese materials can endure the elements better than natural materials, and [they can] sometimes be bleached for ease of cleaning and disinfecting,\u201d she says.\n\nAlso, look to see how the colors of the rug are designed. \u201cIf the color or design of a rug is silk-screened or printed on top of the fibers, you can expect that ink to erode with time,\u201d Jones says. \u201cSynthetic fibers have the color built into the yarns which helps increase color fastness.\u201d\n\nConsider both your comfort preference and your outdoor space\u2019s exposure to the elements when deciding on outdoor rug constructions.\n\nFlat-weaves are known for being quick-drying and more resistant to wear-and-tear from outdoor elements, but they\u2019re less comfortable to walk on. Low- or high-pile rugs, on the other hand, provide that plush comfort, but are better suited to covered areas.\n\nJones also recommends looking for tighter woven fabrics over open weaves, saying \u201cLoose woven rugs can easily fray and come apart.\u201d You should also consider the edges and backing of the rug, as those that are tightly made could prevent fraying over time.\n\nMost outdoor rugs are available in a wide range of size options. Consider your outdoor area and make sure to leave some open space around the rug for the best layout. Also consider shape here\u2014round rugs look great on square patios, and vice versa.\n\nMost outdoor rugs can be hosed down and air dried for regular cleaning and upkeep. But some are even easier to clean, thanks to machine washable properties, while others require professional cleaning.\n\nMake sure to read through manufacturer instructions and consider how much work you\u2019re willing to put in to keep your outdoor rug clean.",

      "text": "Patio umbrellas offer shady solace to make your outdoor space more usable when the sun bakes hot. To find the best patio umbrellas worth considering, our panel of product testers evaluated 11 popular, top-rated options by using them in their own backyards and patios. After observing how they performed under various conditions, nine made the cut: The Treasure Garden Deluxe Auto-Tilt Market Umbrella is our top choice due to its ease of setup, easy-to-adjust tilt feature and compatibility with patio tables of different sizes. For a value pick, we recommend Blissun\u2019s 9-Foot Patio Umbrella because of its intuitive assembly and durability in spite of its under-$50 sticker price.\nHere are all nine of the best patio umbrellas we tested that suit various size and design preferences:\nTo select the best outdoor patio umbrellas of 2025, we enlisted 10 Forbes Vetted product testers to set up 11 outdoor umbrellas in their outdoor spaces. Over the course of two weeks, they evaluated ease of assembly and use, quality of materials, wind resistance, adjustability, ability to provide shade (of course) and value. To assess longterm durability, our panelists will continue to use the nine winners that made this list through the summer months; we\u2019ll update this story later with details on how each patio umbrella performed throughout the season.\nThe Treasure Garden 9-Foot Deluxe Auto-Tilt Market Umbrella is a Goldilocks size for a market patio umbrella, and it will work with patio tables of differing heights. This umbrella comes with an octagonal canopy that is available in a wide array of colors and finishes. Of the umbrellas we tested, this one stood out for being easy to assemble. \u201cIt\u2019s easy and intuitive to put the umbrella together and then get it in the base\u2014the entire process took just a few minutes,\u201d says our tester. She also notes that it can be adjusted depending on the height of your table, as it provides the option to set it to one of two available heights\u2014a nice feature that most umbrellas we tested don\u2019t offer.\nThe Treasure Garden umbrella opens with a simple crank and also has the capability to tilt, so you can adjust the canopy along with the sun\u2019s movements. Our tester says, \u201cThe umbrella is extremely easy to adjust. It stays firmly in place once lifted, and it\u2019s just as easy to lower. Instead of a Velcro strap to secure the umbrella when closed, it ties, which I prefer because the [ties]\nwon\u2019t wear over time.\u201d She notes that she feels noticeably cooler when sitting under it and that it provides sufficient shade to easily see screens if she\u2019s working under the umbrella.Like most patio umbrellas we tested, the Treasure Garden umbrella does not come with a base. We paired it with a 50-pound Treasure Garden base. The company recommends using a base that weighs 50 to 80 pounds, so you have the option to choose a heavier one to ensure your umbrella stays put even on windy days. But so far, the 50 pound option has been sufficient to secure the umbrella, while still being light enough for our tester to move the umbrella around on her own.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a patio umbrella with solar lights to add ambiance to your patio, the Best Choice Products 10-Foot Umbrella With Solar Lights is our top pick. It\u2019s also one of the most affordable recommendations on our list, yet it still earned an impressive 8.5 score from our tester.\nIn addition to having lights for extra style points, the umbrella also comes in a wide variety of bright colors and striped patterns. Our tester calls this option \u201ca great value\u201d and says, \u201cIt\u2019s much less expensive than the other options but doesn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy.\u201d She praised how easy and straightforward the setup is, and says that the fabric is very easy to keep clean. \u201cWe have had a lot of pollen in the past couple of weeks, and I\u2019m able to easily wipe it off with a damp cloth.\u201d\nThe Best Choice Products 10-Foot Umbrella opens and closes with a crank but uses a push-button design to tilt to follow the sun. As far as the included lights, the manufacturer claims the lights hold their charge for six to seven hours. There is an on/off switch on the pole, so they don\u2019t turn on or shut off automatically. All in all, our tester says, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a high-end look like some of the others, but I think it\u2019s beautiful and makes a nice addition to my deck.\u201d We paired it with a compatible base from Best Choice Products that\u2019s recommended by the brand.\nFor the best large patio umbrella, our top pick is the Frontgate 11-Foot Round Outdoor Market Umbrella. This umbrella offers one of the widest ranges of canopy colors and frame combinations of the patio umbrellas we tested. It not only comes in a wide range of colors, but also in different patterns, as well\u2014solids, stripes, botanicals and more. If you\u2019re unsure how to choose, the company offers swatches so you can zero in on the perfect option for you.\nNotably, the Frontgate umbrella\u2019s canopy is made from sturdy, weather-resistant Sunbrella fabric to provide ample shade. Our tester was impressed by the quality. \u201cThe fabric on my umbrella is a thick, high-quality cloth material that feels super durable,\" she says. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely opaque with little to no sunlight getting through it at all, which makes it perfect for full sun protection.\u201d\nShe opted for one of the lighter colors that the canopy comes in, and expected it to pick up some dirt and grime in the first few pollen-heavy weeks of testing. But the umbrella has been easy to maintain. \u201cI would have expected it to get a bit dirty, however, I have not seen anything noticeable yet,\u201d she says.\nThe Frontgate umbrella opens and tilts with the same crank function as the Treasure Garden umbrella we tested. Our tester notes that the crank makes a clicking sound when opening, but works silently when being closed. \u201cOverall, I\u2019m so happy with this umbrella, it looks great and feels high quality,\u201d she says, \u201cI would 100% recommend it to a friend.\u201d\nFrontgate recommends pairing the umbrella with a base of at least 50 pounds when using it with a small table. But note that if you plan to use the umbrella freestanding with a large table, you\u2019ll need a base that weighs at least 100 pounds. (Our tester used the umbrella with a bronze base weighing 100 pounds.) She says that although the base is high-quality, even with the heavier weight, sometimes her umbrella frame would shake a bit in the wind. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely best to use the umbrella on calm days,\u201d she says. This pick also comes in several size options, including 9-foot or 7.5-foot canopies.\nIf you want an under-$50 patio umbrella shipped from Amazon quickly and conveniently, the best-selling Blissun 9-Foot Patio Umbrella, with a 4.5 Amazon star rating out of more than 35,000 reviews, is our recommendation. It offers the same features as many of the higher-priced options we tested and scored a 9 our of 10 from our tester.\nWhile the base is aluminum, the spokes are made of iron, so the umbrella felt extra sturdy. Our tester was able to get it assembled and in the base with no trouble (we used the Blissun Heavy Duty Patio Market Umbrella Base Stand). \u201cThe umbrella felt sturdy and it did come with instructions for setup, although the setup was pretty intuitive. Despite its reasonable price, I don\u2019t think the umbrella is very cheap-looking,\u201d she reports.\nWhile the Blissun is a relatively no-frills option, it does have a tilt feature so you can adjust the canopy with the sun. And it\u2019s available in a large selection of colors and striped patterns, in a waterproof and sun-resistant polyester.\nIf you\u2019re looking for the best cantilever patio umbrella, the Purple Leaf 11-Foot Cantilever Umbrella was a winner in our tests. This umbrella is another 11-foot-diameter canopy, like the Frontgate, but it\u2019s notable for its offset design. The pole stands off to the side, providing unobscured shade compared with an umbrella that has a pole in the middle of a canopy. The cantilever design also means you can place your umbrella over a row of chaise longues or an outdoor sofa, for example, instead of just over a table. It features a double canopy for increased wind-resistance and stability, which proved useful for an umbrella this large in our tests.\nThe Purple Leaf 11-Foot Cantilever Umbrella can rotate 360-degrees and has six different height and angle combinations\u2014one of the best ranges among the umbrellas we tested\u2014so you should always be able to find sun protection. It also comes in a 10-, 12- or 13-foot diameter.\nThis pick was also easy to adjust in testing. Our tester says, \u201cThe umbrella is super easy to use. There is a handle which you squeeze to move the umbrella to the correct height and then a crank to open the umbrella to the desired level of openness. There is also another crank which turns the entire umbrella around 360 [degrees] so you can follow the sun.\u201d\nThe Purple Leaf\u2019s aluminum frame is attractive and sturdy, and the base (sold separately) is designed to keep the umbrella from going anywhere. \u201cThe instructions recommend filling the base with 70% sand and 30% water, which brings the total weight to about 220 pounds, fully filled,\u201d our tester reports. The only downside is that this makes the umbrella heavy to rearrange, so it\u2019s best to pick a permanent spot. \u201cOnce the base is filled, it is very hard to move the umbrella around, so make sure that you have it in the correct spot first,\u201d she says. The combination of the weighted base and the double canopy make this umbrella ideal for spacious outdoor entertainment areas and better suited for breezy climates.\nNot everyone has an expansive outdoor space with room for large umbrellas. If you have a modest city courtyard or your only outdoor space is a balcony, a smaller umbrella will work best for you. The 7-foot-diameter Birch Lane Toscana Patio Umbrella won as best small patio umbrella in our tests thanks to its tilt feature, affordable price and sturdy build. This umbrella also offers UV protection through the eight canopy colors available to choose form.\nOur tester notes that it opens and closes more like a traditional umbrella that you pop open, as opposed to using a crank like many other umbrellas have. \u201cWhile I\u2019m accustomed to umbrellas that rely on a crank to deploy the canopy, I actually like the manual opening mechanism because it\u2019s easy to use and it eliminates parts that could break over time,\u201d he says.\nHe also praises the sturdy construction: \u201cBoth the pole and the spokes are made of steel, so the umbrella feels really sturdy from top to bottom,\u201d he says. \u201cI live in a windy area, but even as big gusts pass by each day, the umbrella stands strong\u2014I haven\u2019t had to worry about it flying off.\u201d\nWe paired the umbrella with the Kade Fiberstone base available through Birch Lane, which comes in two finishes. Setup was seamless; our tester says he didn\u2019t even need the instructions.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a super heavy-duty cantilever option, the Frontgate Altura is one of the best patio umbrellas for wind. It comes with a substantial base to weigh it down, and with an extra-large, shade-providing canopy, you\u2019ll appreciate this added stability when the breeze kicks up. Those with large outdoor dining sets or entertainment spaces will appreciate the Altura canopy\u2019s sizable coverage area, in particular.\nThe umbrella rotates 360 degrees and has a tilt feature, so you should be able to block the sun\u2019s rays all day long. The aluminum base is available in two finishes: one in silver, and one that resembles teak wood. The canopy is only available in three colors, but they are all tasteful and relatively neutral shades.\nThis umbrella does require a more intensive setup than our other picks. After setting it up, our tester reports: \u201cNot only is the umbrella really tall, it\u2019s heavy, so you need help to guide it into place and then lift it up so it slides down on the pole. \u2026 One thing that\u2019s very notable is that this base requires twelve 16- by 16-inch concrete pavers. Each one is 36 pounds, so that\u2019s 432 pounds of combined weight that you\u2019ll have to carry and place into the base.\u201d This option is best for people that want to keep a patio umbrella in a permanent spot.\nThe Pottery Barn 10-Foot Rectangular Outdoor Umbrella stood out for being the best rectangular patio umbrella. I tested this umbrella, and the shape and size works noticeably better paired with my rectangular backyard table than my previous octagonal umbrella did.\nSetup was simple, and I found the included illustrated directions clear and easy to follow. The umbrella opens and closes with a convenient crank, which also controls the tilt feature. The aluminum frame feels very durable and heavy, as do the spokes. Since the canopy is larger in one direction than the other, it tends to catch the breeze, a bit like a sail. The heavy duty construction gives me confidence that it\u2019s not going to take off.\nThis umbrella comes in 16 different colors and patterns, most of which are made from Sunbrella fabric, while three are made of recycled canvas. While there aren\u2019t as many color options as some other picks on our list, the Pottery Barn choices are quite nice. I picked a black-and-white striped Sunbrella canopy, and I love its striking look. Due to the stripes, much of the fabric is white, so the UV protection offered by Sunbrella is welcome, as the light seems to penetrate through the white areas.\nWhile the light color means that I can easily see any creepy-crawlies on the canopy top, which isn\u2019t my favorite, it still provides plenty of shade for viewing screens. Priced at more than $700, this is a more expensive option than many umbrellas on our list. But knowing that this is a sturdy and well-made, high-quality product makes me feel confident that it won\u2019t invert or take off in the wind. Still, I recommend being attentive and closing the umbrella when the breeze picks up.\nI ended up pairing the umbrella with the lowest price Pottery Barn base, the 66-pound concrete umbrella base (around $200). But there are three other options on the site, which offers flexibility so you can choose the best base for your needs.\nThe L. L. Bean 9-Foot Sunbrella Market Umbrella is a classic patio umbrella with a chic look. Our tester says, \u201cThis model is a sturdy and good-looking umbrella with a medium-weight, soft-textured fabric.\u201d\nThis umbrella does function differently than others we tested. Unlike the umbrellas that open with a crank or have push-button features, the L. L. Bean uses a pulley system. You have to push it open manually, explains our tester. Then, \u201cYou slot a steel key into a hole of your choice based on how open you want the umbrella (there are four options total) to secure it to that level of openness,\u201d she adds.\nNote that this option does not have a tilt feature. Despite being very impressed with the umbrella in general, our tester notes, \u201cBecause the umbrella is not massively huge and does not tilt, plus the base is quite heavy (we used the L. L. Bean Market Umbrella Stand), it\u2019s difficult to maneuver around throughout the course of an afternoon when the sun is changing positions.\u201d This umbrella is best for those set on a wooden frame and a classic aesthetic.\nOther Patio Umbrellas We Tested\nOut of 11 patio umbrellas tested, two didn\u2019t make the cut. Here were the other two contenders, plus the reasons why we didn\u2019t pick them as winners.\n- Midtown Umbrellas LED Swilt Umbrella ($400 at Amazon): The Midtown Umbrella didn\u2019t measure up to other umbrellas we tested despite its relatively high price. Our tester wasn\u2019t happy with the canopy fabric, saying, \u201cThe way the stitching is done makes the edges look slightly cheap, and the way the fabric goes over the edge of each point of the frame can be off until you adjust it.\u201d It was also wobbly, giving us pause on how well it would hold up over time. Still, our tester liked how it adjusts and tilts and that it has lights, which can be charged manually or by the sun.\n- Birch Lane Iago 9-Foot Outdoor Umbrella ($209 at Wayfair): While our tester was a fan of the Iago\u2019s aesthetics, she didn\u2019t feel that it was very sturdy. \u201cThe fabric on the Birch Lane Iago umbrella looks and feels elevated, like an umbrella you\u2019d sit under at a fancy hotel on the Amalfi Coast,\u201d she says. But when it comes to its construction, she wished the frame materials felt sturdier. Still, she says, \u201cIf you mainly care about aesthetics and not as much about how the umbrella could hold up in all kinds of weather, this is one of the cutest and most reasonably priced options I\u2019ve seen.\"\nHow We Tested The Best Patio Umbrellas\nWe tasked 10 Forbes Vetted testers with trying out 11 patio umbrellas in their own backyards and patios to find the best ones. Our testers evaluated features including ease of assembly, adjustability and quality of canopy fabric. Our initial testing time frame was two weeks, and we will continue to check in with our testers throughout the summer to evaluate how durable these outdoor umbrellas prove to be over time. Here are the criteria we considered in our tests:\n- Setup: Our testers noted their experience assembling their umbrellas, specifically around whether instructions were included (and if they helped), whether one person could set up the umbrella on their own, how complicated the setup was and how easily the frame fit into the base.\n- Frame: Testers evaluated how sturdy their umbrella\u2019s frame felt and how well the frame supported the open canopy.\n- Canopy: Testers evaluated the texture and feel of the canopy fabric, whether it was waterproof, and how much sun protection it provided. We noted whether the canopy our testers received matched how it looked online.\n- Adjustability: Our testers tried out every adjustment and angle available with their patio umbrellas. We noted whether these adjustments were easy or difficult, how sturdy mechanisms like buttons or cranks were to operate, and if the frame remained strong and upright during adjustments.\n- Ease of cleaning: The umbrella canopies we tested came with a variety of care instructions, from hosing off to spot cleaning to washing in a machine. Testers cleaned umbrellas as needed, handling any debris or staining with a hose or by spot-cleaning per manufacturer directions.\n- Special features: Of the patio umbrellas we tested that offer special features, we tested how well those performed. For the ones with solar lights, for instance, our testers noted how well the lights work and how long they held a charge. We also tested umbrellas that featured wind vents to help their canopy withstand strong breezes and made note of their effectiveness.\nHow To Pick The Best Patio Umbrellas\nBefore you select a patio umbrella, consider sizing, style, base, material and special features. We reached out for expert advice from Jessica Sidey, senior visual merchandiser at Christy Sports, on how to pick the best patio umbrella for your particular space:\nSize\nBefore you choose your umbrella canopy, make sure it\u2019s an appropriate size for your outdoor area. Consider any table or outdoor furniture the umbrella will be shielding, and also how many people you expect to sit under it. Canopies of 6 or 7 feet can fit on a small balcony or patio, and are usually sufficient to protect a small bistro table.\nSidey shares some additional guidance on how to choose the right umbrella size. \u201cUmbrellas [should] be 2 feet larger on each side than the area you want to shade,\u201d she says. \u201cFor example, a 4- to 5-foot table would need a 7-foot umbrella; a 6- to 7-foot table would need a 9-foot umbrella.\u201d For large spaces needing an offset umbrella frame, \u201cI love cantilever umbrellas for deep seating areas, and they can range from 10 feet to 13 feet,\u201d Sidey says.\nStyle\nIn general, most market-style patio umbrellas can either stand alone or be inserted through a hole in the middle of a table. Cantilever-style umbrellas are useful to shade an outdoor sectional sofa or a row of lounge chairs, for example, when there isn\u2019t a table as the centerpiece.\nBase\nThe most important job of a base is to support the umbrella\u2019s size. \u201cWeight, style, material and mobility are the top things to consider when choosing a base,\u201d Sidey says. Generally, Sidey recommends a base of at least 50 pounds for a 6- to 7-foot umbrella. If your canopy measures 7.5 to 9 feet, look for a base that weighs at least 75 pounds. Extra-large or cantilever umbrellas need a very stable base that weighs at least 100 pounds. These bases are often filled with a mixture of water and playground sand. Some may require the addition of stone pavers to keep a large umbrella secure in the breeze. Especially when it comes to a heavier base, \u201cLook for wheels if you want to move it around,\u201d Sidey recommends.\nFunctionality\nSome patio umbrellas are simple and don\u2019t offer any adjustments, while others rotate or have a button or crank to tilt to follow the sun. Others use a pulley system or push up like a traditional umbrella. If your umbrella tilts, make sure you know what type of control it has and if it\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. Sidey explains some of the most common controls to look for in your patio umbrellas:\n- Crank lift: This mechanism is easiest for daily use. Just turn the crank to open or close the canopy.\n- Push-button tilt: This lets you tilt the umbrella to block angled sunlight.\n- Auto tilt: This style will tilt automatically as you crank\u2014it\u2019s a great one-handed option. This also allows for your sensitive adjusting than a push button option.\n- Pulley system: A more traditional system found on wooden umbrellas, a pully requires a bit more effort.\n- Rotation and swivel (on cantilever umbrellas): This mechanism has 360-degree movement for adjustable shade.\nConstruction\nA patio umbrella\u2019s construction is one of the most important indicators of its quality. Look specifically at the materials of both the frame and the canopy. \u201cI prefer aluminum-frame umbrellas because they are lightweight, rust-resistant and more durable than wood,\u201d says Sidey. \u201cHowever, if you are looking for a more classic look, a wood umbrella frame can be a great option\u2014they just require more maintenance.\u201d Most of our recommended umbrellas have aluminum frames, although we do include one wood option. In terms of the canopy, patio umbrellas come in a variety of fabrics, such as canvas or polyester, but look for material that offers UV protection: \u201cAcrylic fabrics like Sunbrella or O\u2019Bravia are my go-tos,\u201d Sidey says.\nFeatures\nTake note of what extra accessories or features your patio umbrella comes with. Some have an extra vent to allow the canopy to withstand strong breezes better. Solar and LED lights are a relatively common extra that are included with some umbrellas.\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\nThe team that run\u2019s Forbes Vetted\u2019s home and kitchen vertical has decades\u2019 worth of combined experience researching, testing and reporting on the products we use every day\u2014including in our outdoor spaces.

      "text": "For restoring the look of decks, driveways and exterior siding, a standard hose often falls short. A high-quality pressure washer offers the power and precision required to remove built-up dirt, mold and grime from a range of outdoor surfaces. The best pressure washers go one step further, combining robust performance with thoughtful design to deliver the versatility to handle both heavy-duty cleaning and more delicate tasks like car washing. After extensive research and expert input, our top recommendations include the Sun Joe Xtream Electric Pressure Washer and the Simpson Cleaning PS3228 PowerShot Gas Pressure Washer, both of which impressed us with thoughtful design features and consistent performance.\nAs with any power tool, choosing the right pressure washer depends on how and where you plan to use it. Factors like water pressure (PSI), flow rate (GPM), nozzle attachments and power source all affect how well a machine performs for specific tasks. \u201cSelecting an appropriate pressure washer requires careful consideration, as various factors influence its effectiveness for specific tasks,\u201d explains Lawrence Bradley of Bradley\u2019s Cleaning. \u201cUnderstanding these nuances is crucial for both optimal performance and equipment longevity.\u201d Read on for our expert-backed picks on the best pressure washers to consider in 2025.\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\nThe home team at Forbes Vetted is committed to helping you find the best products to make the most out of your outdoor space, from robotic pool cleaners to electric lawn mowers.\n- Monica Petrucci is the author of this article and a commerce writer that covers home topics at Forbes Vetted. She has been testing and researching home products for several years, including everything from grill covers to fake plants.\n- For this article, we interviewed pressure washing professionals who work in the field to inform our top picks for this list. Elliott Hood, owner and operator at FlowMows Lawn & Pressure Washing, as well as Larry Bradley, co-founder of Bradley\u2019s Cleaning, provided insight about the most important features to look for in the best pressure washers.\n- We prioritize keeping all of our content relevant and up to date in order to provide the most helpful information for our readers. This article was last updated in July 2025.\nHow We Chose The Best Pressure Washers\nWe combined in-depth research with expert insight in order to pull together a comprehensive list of the best pressure washers.\n- We collected information from Hood and Bradley regarding the most important features in high-quality pressure washers. This included PSI and GPM range, power-to-weight ratio, nozzle systems and more. These insights were implemented into our top pick selections.\n- Although most units on this list are electric pressure washers\u2014which reflects the majority of the options on the market\u2014we made sure to include a gas model for anyone shopping for a heavy-duty machine.\n- We scoured through consumer reviews to gauge whether our selections have proven real-world performance, especially when it comes to longevity. Any common complaints or praises from owners were reflected in our reviews.\n- We made sure to only include products with a 4-star rating or higher, prioritizing picks that have been widely well received by consumers.\nWhat To Consider With The Best Pressure Washers\n\u201cWhen shopping for a pressure washer, it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with numbers, specs and sheer options,\u201d Hood says. That\u2019s why we broke down the most important specs and features to look out for to ensure you\u2019re making the best purchase for your individual needs.\nGas Vs. Electric Pressure Washers\nThis may be one of the first considerations you have to make when deciding on the best pressure washer for you. As Hood puts it, \u201cboth gas and electric pressure washers have their place. It really depends on your needs.\u201d\nElectric pressure washers are great for most light-to-medium jobs around the house. \u201cThey\u2019re lower maintenance, quieter, have no emissions and are easy to store and tote around,\u201d Hood says. \u201cThe downside is that electric washers are typically limited in PSI output, and you have to be near an electrical outlet to use them.\u201d\nGas pressure washers are better suited to heavy-duty cleaning, making them the best match for industrial usage\u2014especially since they aren\u2019t limited to power cord ranges. However, they also have significant downsides. They\u2019re often louder and heavier than their electric counterparts. They also require more maintenance than electric washers, including regular fueling and oil changes.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re the average homeowner, an electric model is likely the way to go,\u201d Hood says.\nPSI (Pounds Per Square Inch)\nA pressure washer\u2019s PSI number reflects its pressure strength. As Hood puts it, \u201cit\u2019s how hard the water hits the surface.\u201d It\u2019s one of the most important metrics to consider when shopping for a pressure washer, as it\u2014along with the GPM (more on that below)\u2014reflects the unit\u2019s performance foundation.\nHigher isn\u2019t necessarily always better in this case. The ideal PSI range depends on the intended use of the pressure washer. \u201cFor most jobs around the house, like washing patios, outdoor furniture, cars and siding, a PSI range of 1,800-2,800 is more than enough,\u201d Hood says. \u201cThat\u2019s the sweet spot for versatility, giving you the cleaning power you need without risking damage to any delicate spots or surfaces.\u201d\nHeavy-duty tasks like tough stains, grease removal and paint prep require more power, with a machine that has a PSI of 3,000 or higher. But Hood says for average homeowners, this PSI level is often overkill. \u201cFocus on matching the PSI to the surface you\u2019re cleaning instead of just looking for the washer with the highest number,\u201d he says.\nGPM (Gallons Per Minute)\nIn addition to the PSI, the GPM (gallons per minute) is the other most important metric when considering pressure washing performance. \u201cGPM is about flow rate, or how much water is moving through\u201d in a certain amount of time, Hood explains.\nMultiplying PSI by GPM gives you a pressure washer\u2019s Cleaning Units, a measure of overall cleaning power. \u201cThese give you a more complete picture of overall cleaning power of a pressure washer.\u201d\nSpray Nozzles\nMost high-quality pressure washers come with a variety of spray nozzle options, which are great for expanding the versatility of the unit. \u201cThis is great for moving from blasting mildew off your concrete wall and then rinsing your car,\u201d Hood says. He recommends looking for a quick-connect nozzle system, which is \u201ca bonus for ease and efficiency.\u201d\nBradley emphasizes the importance of selecting nozzles to match the unit\u2019s GPM output. \u201cEach nozzle is designed to handle a specific flow rate. For instance, pairing an 8 GPM pressure washer with nozzles rated for 4 GPM will invariably overload the pump, leading to premature damage and costly repairs,\u201d he explains.\nLuckily, most modern pressure washer units on the market today are bundled with a set of appropriately matched nozzles. But if you\u2019re shopping for additional nozzles, keep this in mind."

      "text": "A comfortable and durable outdoor sectional is the key to turning your backyard into an open-air living room. As such, \u201cInvest in a well-made piece that\u2019s built to withstand the elements and look great for years to come,\u201d says interior designer Kathy Kuo. Based on her advice (plus that of two other interior designers), our home editors analyzed options from reputable brands to find the best outdoor sectionals that are chic, durable and comfortable. Our favorite patio sectional is the West Elm Westport 3-Piece L-Shaped, which is crafted from durable synthetic wicker that resists fading, cracking and sagging. If you\u2019re looking for an outdoor sectional set under $1,000, choose Sundale Outdoor\u2019s 7-Piece option: It comes with a coffee table and has a modular design that makes it adaptable for a wide variety of spaces.\nTo choose the right outdoor sectional, consider four key factors: Your space, the frame and upholstery materials, the design, and required maintenance. It\u2019s a lot to consider (and a sizable investment), so to simplify your decision, we\u2019ve evaluated this criteria for you. Ahead, find the nine best outdoor sectionals for every type of backyard and patio\u2014and for more savings, now is the time to shop this year\u2019s 4th of July patio furniture sales.\nComfortable, All-Weather Wicker That Won\u2019t Wear Out\nWest Elm Westport 3-Piece L-Shaped Sectional\nSize: 107.7 x 107.7 x 34 inches |Frame: Synthetic woven wicker, metal | Upholstery: Unlisted (water-, mold- and mildew-resistant) | Cushions: Polyester fiber, foam | Capacity: 5 | Colors: 1 option, Alabaster | Customizable: No | Certifications: None listed\nPros:\nDurable synthetic wicker won\u2019t wear down easily\nComfortable, deep seats for lounging\nCushions resist mold and mildew\nCons:\nCushions only come in one color\nKuo recommends picking outdoor sectionals made from long-lasting synthetic wicker, like West Elm\u2019s Westport sectional. Synthetic wicker works well in most climates because it\u2019s easy to clean and naturally handles moisture, mold and dirt. This three-piece sectional\u2019s woven wicker looks convincingly natural, with a warm, neutral tone that works nicely with different outdoor styles, whether your space leans modern, coastal or somewhere in between. The sectional sofa is substantial enough to comfortably seat five adults, but its low-slung shape keeps it from feeling overwhelming, even if your space is on the smaller side. (Plus, the wide armrests give you enough room to rest drinks, potentially eliminating the need for a side table.)\nThe cushions themselves are thick, supportive and specifically made to resist moisture, mold and mildew, though West Elm still recommends protecting the sectional with an appropriate cover during rough weather or extended periods when it\u2019s not in use. Kuo agrees, saying, \u201cNatural wicker is beautiful, but you can\u2019t leave it out exposed to the elements the same way that you can with synthetic wicker pieces and expect to have a long usage life.\u201d\nEditor\u2019s note: This 108-inch version of the Westport currently lists its estimated delivery as between December and January. We\u2019ll keep tabs on whether this changes, but the 97-inch version of this L-sectional (in the Seashore colorway) lists its delivery as later this summer.\nSundale\u2019s sectional proves you can find attractive and well-made outdoor furniture without overspending. This modular set includes multiple seating pieces, so you can easily arrange or rearrange the configuration depending on your space or event. Whether you have a compact balcony or a roomier outdoor patio, these pieces are designed to work well together in various layouts. It also comes with a coffee table that features wooden slats, so water quickly drains if there\u2019s an accidental spill or rainstorm.\nThe cushions are notably thick\u20146 inches\u2014and made from Olefin fabric, which is a durable material that resists moisture, staining and UV rays. (It\u2019s also made without any harmful chemicals.) Each piece has a sturdy metal frame (currently available in Grey or White) with a rust-resistant coating, so you don\u2019t have to worry about leaving it outside all season. One thing to note, though, is that the cushions only come in one hue; grabbing a pair of these waterproof throw pillows (also on Amazon) could be a good way to add a pop of color to the set.\nBest Modern Outdoor Sectional\nA Wood And Steel Design With A Chic, Low Profile\nArticle Lubek Low Corner Sectional\nSize: 100.5 x 22 x 98.5 inches | Frame: Acacia, steel | Upholstery: Polyester | Cushions: Foam, poly fiber | Capacity: 5 | Colors: 2 options, Slate Gray and Beach Sand |Customizable: No | Certifications: None listed\nPros:\nClean lines create a modern look\nLow profile feels sleek and contemporary\nCushions available in two neutral shades\nCons:\nAcacia wood requires more upkeep\nBack cushions don\u2019t have ties to secure them\nThe Article Lubek Low Corner Sectional is ideal for patios with a modern aesthetic or outdoor spaces that entertain families or large groups. It has an angular design and noticeably low profile that gives it a distinctly modern feel compared with traditional outdoor sofas. The frame combines solid acacia wood and powder-coated steel, creating a refined, industrial-inspired look. You can select your preferred alignment\u2014left, right or corner\u2014depending on your space and layout.\nThe cushions, which are available in Beach Sand or Slate Gray, are simple, comfortable and weather-resistant. Just keep in mind that acacia wood naturally weathers to a softer gray over time, plus it requires more maintenance than synthetic materials or metal. That said, we do like that the cushions are fade-resistant\u2014a must if your space gets a lot of sun.\nBest Outdoor Sectional With Chaise\nA Large Pick That Comes In Luxe Colors And Performance Fabrics\nSerena & Lily Pacifica Chaise Sectional\nSize: 90 x 68 x 28 inches |Frame: Synthetic wicker, aluminum | Upholstery: Performance fabric | Cushions: Foam, polyester | Capacity: 3 | Colors: 2 options, White and Chalk |Customizable: No | Certifications: None listed\nPros:\nCasual but elegant vibe\nDurable fabric that comes in a variety of colors\nCushions are secured with Velcro\nCons:\nYou may find a similar pick for a lower price\nIf you have a bigger budget and are looking for a stylish outdoor sofa with a built-in chaise, look to Serena & Lily, whose elegant, coastal outdoor furniture designs garnered the brand a spot on our list of the best outdoor sofas. For this particular need, consider the company\u2019s Pacifica Sectional, which is available in right- or left-facing options. Made from resin wicker with a powder-coated aluminum frame, this sectional is built to last. That durability extends to the cushions, which are stuffed with all-weather foam and polyester fill and covered in performance fabrics that can withstand water, mildew and UV exposure. The seat cushions also have Velcro tabs to attach them to the frame, minimizing the odds you\u2019ll slide down as you\u2019re seated. This pick features Perennial upholstery, Serena & Lily\u2019s performance fabric that some reviewers say feels and looks like a more luxurious version of Sunbrella. And despite its delicate design, the frame itself is quite strong, able to hold up to 600 pounds.\nBest Outdoor Sectional For Small Spaces\nA Modular Set That Fits Easily Into Tight Or Awkward Areas\nBurrow Relay Outdoor 3-Piece Open Sectional\nSize: 60 x 32 x 33 inches |Frame: Powder-coated steel | Upholstery: Performance fabric | Cushions: Foam, mesh | Capacity: 3 | Colors: 2 options, Salt and Shale |Customizable: Yes | Certifications: None listed\nPros:\nSmall footprint and easy to rearrange\nQuick-drying cushions resist water and stains\nSimple, tool-free assembly\nCons:\nLimited cushion colors\nPricey for the size\nBurrow\u2019s Relay sectional is ideal if your outdoor space is limited or oddly shaped. The set is composed of three modular pieces that easily snap together, no tools needed, allowing you to adjust or reconfigure as your needs or space change. What\u2019s more, the galvanized steel frame doesn\u2019t rust or corrode easily, even if your furniture lives outside year-round. Cushion covers, available in two neutral colors (salt or shale), use performance fabric designed to repel dirt, stains and moisture. Reviewers frequently highlight how comfortable the Relay feels, while the quick-dry foam cushions reduce water retention after rainy days. Others note how easy it is to assemble, with one saying it takes about 10 minutes. You can even disassemble and neatly store the set in the off season.\nBest Low-Maintenance Outdoor Sectional\nA Durable Sectional That You Can Leave Outside Year-Round\nPolywood\u2019s outdoor furniture pieces are popular, and with good reason: They\u2019re incredibly easy to care for. Made from high-density polyethylene lumber, this modular sectional won\u2019t need repainting, sealing or regular waterproofing. The material itself is designed to handle strong sun, rainstorms and temperature swings without noticeable fading or wear, so you don\u2019t have to worry about leaving it outside all year. In addition, the cushions are crafted from outdoor performance fabric that\u2019s designed to resist moisture, sun damage, mold and mildew. But don\u2019t let the fabric\u2019s ruggedness fool you\u2014users say the fabric is still soft while being quite low maintenance.\nWhile it\u2019s still a good idea to cover or store them during bad weather or the off season, this outdoor sectional is sturdy enough for regular outdoor use. In fact, some reviewers who don\u2019t have adequate storage space like that this piece can stay outside most of the time, in a variety of seasons. Plus, the sectional comes in dozens of frame finish and fabric options so you can find one that works with your outdoor space.\nBest Teak Outdoor Sectional\nA Modern, Modular Option Made From Kiln-Dried Wood\nNeighbor Haven Sectional\nSize: 91 x 30.5 x 17.5 inches |Frame: Kiln-dried teak, polyester | Upholstery: Sunbrella | Cushions: Reticulated (low-density) foam | Capacity: 3 | Colors: 7 options, including Rust and Indigo | Customizable: Yes | Certifications: FSC-certified wood\nPros:\nVery sturdy and weather-resistant teak construction\nWarm, simple and modular design\nCushions are both comfortable and quick-drying\nCons:\nAssembly can be tedious\nIf you\u2019re looking for the warm, inviting look of a wooden outdoor sectional, furniture experts vouch for teak as an excellent choice. \u201cTeak is a dense hardwood that has natural oils that protect it from moisture, insects and decay\u2014meaning it will survive for years without much maintenance,\u201d says Milly McEwan, product and design manager at Australian design firm RJ Living.\nNeighbor\u2019s Haven Sectional is a great example, thanks to its beautiful solid teak construction that\u2019s kiln-dried for extra durability. The couch is topped with reticulated foam cushions covered in weather-proof Sunbrella fabric; practically speaking, \u201creticulated\u201d means the cushions don\u2019t get soggy and dry quickly when it rains. Finally, its modular design can be reconfigured to fit the needs of your space.\nBest U-Shaped Outdoor Sectional\nSpacious, Rugged And Endlessly Modular\nAAPI-Owned\nOuter Charcoal Aluminum U Sectional\nSize: 127.2 x 63.6 x 34.6 inches |Frame: Powder-coated aluminum alloy | Upholstery: Olefin (performance fabric) | Cushions: Memory and high-resiliency foam, polypropylene fiber | Capacity: 6 | Colors: 5 options, including Standstone Gray and Deep Sea Navy |Customizable: Yes | Certifications: None listed\nPros:\nModular design allows for flexible configuration\nBacked by 10-year frame warranty and five-year cushion warranty\nVery responsive and accommodating customer service\nCons:\nIt\u2019s a significant financial investment\nIf you\u2019re looking for a cozy setting for a large number of guests to mingle, invest in a U-shaped sectional, like this attractive pick by Outer. This modular option is roomy enough to allow people to stretch out while still being endlessly customizable: It comes with one armless loveseat, two sectional chairs and two armless chairs. The sectional is built for easy maintenance, with a rust-resistant powder-coated aluminum frame and machine-washable performance fabric on the multi-layer foam cushions. A standout feature is the built-in OuterShell cushion that easily rolls over each seat; it\u2019s easily Velcroed in place and has a handle for portability.\nWhile it\u2019s the most expensive pick on our list (currently discounted from its $9,000 sticker price), happy customers say it\u2019s worth the investment. Adding to the value is an industry-leading warranty: Outer backs its products with a 10-year warranty on frames and a five-year warranty on cushions.\nBacked by 10-year frame warranty and five-year fabric warranty\nFire pit comes with a protective lid that turns it into a table\nVery sturdy aluminum and wicker construction\nModular design that clips together for stability\nCons:\nThose who live in very windy areas will need a more secure fire pit cover\nThe maker of our home team\u2019s favorite outdoor dining set, Yardbird also offers an equally sturdy and attractive sectional fire pit set. Its frame is exceptionally sturdy, made from hardy aluminum and wrapped in sustainable synthetic wicker\u2014two materials that furniture experts say are among the most weather-resistant and long-lasting. Its durable build doesn\u2019t take away from the set\u2019s comfort and style, however. The wicker frame is a dark espresso brown that\u2019s cozy but modern, and the laid-back minimalist cushions are made with 6 inches of dual-density foam for ample support. (Plus, they\u2019re covered with Sunbrella fabric for easy cleaning.)\nWe\u2019d be remiss not to mention the four side tables included, which offer storage and a surface for drinks (each comes with a powder-coated aluminum tray). The round fire table comes with a cover that turns it into an additional center table. It also opens on the side, so you can slide out a propane carriage to hold a propane tank. The quality of the materials, ease of maintenance and capacity of Yardbird\u2019s outdoor sectional set make it a great choice for large families with kids; the gas fire pit is a boon, too, for those who don\u2019t want to breathe in ash and smoke.\nIn addition, home updates writer Fran Sales contributed to writing and reporting; she last updated this story in July 2025, highlighting key features and user insights to further inform your shopping decisions.\nOur team gathered key insights from three outdoor furniture and design experts to inform our reporting, including: Milly McEwan, product and design manager at Australian design firm RJ Living; Kathy Kuo, CEO and founder of Kathy Kuo Home; and Jan Odesanya, principal interior designer at Mond\u00e4n & Co Interiors.\nHow We Chose The Best Outdoor Sectionals\nTo find the best outdoor sectionals, we compared features from various best-selling models and asked industry experts for product recommendations and insights on what to look for.\nOur home and kitchen editorial team focused on top-rated, best-selling models from trusted outdoor furniture brands like Polywood, West Elm, Burrow and Frontgate.\nWe analyzed features including materials, dimensions, maintenance and design to assess each outdoor sectional\u2019s overall value.\nWe consulted three interior designers to determine what specific features to look for in a good outdoor sectional.\nWe took customer reviews and average star ratings into careful account, sticking to models that have garnered at least an average rating of 4 stars and only a negligible amount of concerning reviews, if any.\nThis final selection of outdoor sectionals reflect in-depth research conducted by our writers and meticulous vetting by the editorial team.\nHow To Pick The Best Outdoor Sectionals\nIf you\u2019re thinking of upgrading your outdoor space with a new sectional, here\u2019s what to keep in mind as you shop.\nMaterials\nIt\u2019s crucial to purchase an outdoor sectional that\u2019s made of durable and weather-appropriate materials\u2014even if you plan on keeping your patio furniture under a roof or covered. \u201cWhen you are deciding on the material you want, make sure that you are considering the weather where you live, and how you want the space to look in five years, because some materials will not take as kindly to the aging process,\u201d says McEwan.\nSteel and aluminum are some of the most durable materials, according to experts: \u201cMarine-grade stainless steel and powder-coated aluminum are workhorses in brutal climates,\u201d says Odesanya. For fans of a woven wicker look, seek outdoor sectionals made of synthetic wicker or rattan, which consists of recycled plastics. This is the material Kuo recommends the most: \u201cIn my opinion, outdoor furniture made from all-weather synthetic polyethylene wicker is what is going to stand up best to the elements and look the best while doing so.\u201d\nBoth aluminum and synthetic wicker/rattan (also called HDPE or poly lumber) tend to be easier to clean, too\u2014important for furniture that will be living mostly outdoors. \u201c[Aluminum] is essentially rust-resistant and can easily look brand new with a quick wipe-down,\u201d says McEwan. \u201cNow, resin wicker, because it\u2019s a synthetic material, will resist moisture and dirt, making it easy to quickly hose off or wipe down with a mild soap and water mix.\u201d\nAnd if you\u2019re a fans of wood furniture, need not fret. While it\u2019s true that wood is the most high-maintenance furniture material due to its porous nature, sectionals made with teak are particularly rot-resistant\u2014though it helps to add a wood sealer to further protect it. McEwan explains, \u201cTeak is a dense hardwood that has natural oils that protect it from moisture, insects and decay\u2014meaning it will survive for years without much maintenance.\u201d Do note that as teak weathers, it turns into an attractive silver-gray and develops a velvet-like texture.\nCushions\nEvaluate the cushions\u2019 fabric covering and insert; Odesanya recommends looking for \u201ca quick-dry cushion construction with moisture barriers between the foam and fabric.\u201d Above all, prioritize cushions with coverings that are described as water-resistant, weather-proof and high-performance. These materials include Sunbrella, Olefin and other performance polyester and acrylic fabrics. Cushion fill is also important, particularly when it comes to your preferred level of firmness, as well as how much effort you want to spend on maintenance. High-density foam, for instance, tends to be firmer and more supportive, and its closed cells will tend to repel, not absorb, moisture. Reticulated (open cell) foam, on the other hand, lets both air and water flow easily through it, meaning it dries more quickly (and tends to be cushier).\nSize And Layout\nSize matters when it comes to an outdoor sectional, both in terms of how many people you\u2019re planning to entertain, as well as the layout of your space. To figure out the right capacity for you, it\u2019s important to carefully measure your outdoor space to see what size can comfortably fit. If you have a growing family, you may want to get a customizable or modular design that allows you to add or remove sections as needed. Outdoor furniture should also be proportional to your space; choosing a sectional that\u2019s too big can make it feel crowded. On the other hand, a sofa that\u2019s too small can leave your patio looking empty. It\u2019s important to find a balance that\u2019s visually appealing, but still allows for real-life use; remember to leave ample clearance for walking around your sectional and other furniture.\nCare\nThere are a few general guidelines to keep in mind to help extend the life of your furniture: First, it\u2019s a good idea to store your cushions in a dry, dark location when they\u2019re not in use. You also want to give your furniture a good wipe-down about once a month with a damp cloth and some mild soap to eliminate any dust, dirt, pollen or stains. (Learning how to properly clean your patio can help extend the life of all your pieces.) Every outdoor sectional is slightly different, so it\u2019s important to read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions as well as consider how much maintenance different types of furniture material require. Wood outdoor sectionals, for example, will weather more slowly when a wood sealer is applied. Regardless of the materials of your sectional, companies typically recommend using a cover to protect your furniture when it\u2019s not in use for extended periods and during storms.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nFor sturdiness and durability, look for outdoor sectionals with frames made from aluminum, synthetic wicker or teak. Aluminum is the strongest of these, but lighter-weight and more resistant to rust than similarly durable metals, like iron; aluminum furniture is also typically powder-coated to boost durability. While synthetic wicker is woven like natural wicker, it\u2019s actually made from sustainable materials like recycled plastics, which makes it lower-maintenance and longer-lasting than its natural counterpart. Lastly, teak, unlike more porous hardwood, has naturally occurring rot- and moisture-resistant oils that help it survive a lot longer, particularly when coated with wood sealant.\nAs far as upholstery, weather-resistant performance fabrics made from polyester, acrylic, Sunbrella and Olefin are designed to resist UV rays, stains and moisture while being easy to clean.\nThe best fabrics for outdoor sectionals are performance fabrics treated for UV, moisture and stain resistance. These include polyester, acrylic, Sunbrella and Olefin. These fabrics are also typically fade-proof and friendly for kids and pets.\nThe best outdoor sectionals to leave outside are ones made with the most weather-resistant frames, fabrics and cushions because they are typically the lowest maintenance. Those made with aluminum or synthetic frames and that come with performance fabric covers and quick-drying cushions are the most impervious to inclement weather, fading, UV rays and stains from pets or heavy usage.\nFor added protection, you should cover your outdoor sectional with a furniture cover, especially during inclement weather, and it\u2019s best to store your pieces indoors during the off season."

(But your budget matters, too.) Here are our picks for the best flat-top grills on the market to bring more mealtimes outside.\nSimple And Intuitive With Several Convenient Features\nBlackstone Original Omnivore 28-Inch Propane Griddle\nDimensions: 59 x 26 x 37 inches |Weight: 86 pounds |Total cooking area: 524 square inches |Cooking power: 24,000 BTUs\nBest for:\nIntuitive outdoor cooking\nCooking two different foods at once\nEasy cleanup\nSkip if:\nYou\u2019re looking for a pre-seasoned grill\nIn the flat-top grill space, one highly regarded brand stands out from the rest. \u201cBlackstone is the king of flat-top grills,\" say barbecue experts Maddie and Kiki Longo. \u201cMany brands have followed suit and developed copycats to add to their fleet of products.\u201d\nAnd one of the most popular models\u2014which is our top recommendation\u2014is the Original Omnivore 28-Inch Griddle. Featuring two separately controlled cook zones and the brand\u2019s signature Omnivore Plate, this model is designed to preheat quickly and distribute heat evenly. It also comes with a built-in hinged lid, which Sidoriak emphasizes as a must-have feature. \u201cIt lets moisture and rain run off, and it keeps leaf pollen and other things from hitting the griddle surface,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes such a difference.\u201d\nThere a few other helpful features, including wind guards to retain hot air, two side shelves with built-in hooks for convenient storage and two caster wheels for easy portability. Just make sure to season the surface regularly\u2014especially before the first use\u2014since it doesn\u2019t come pre-seasoned.\nBest Budget Flat-Top Grill\nAffordable And Sturdy Enough For Casual Grillers\nNexgrill Daytona 2-Burner Flat Top Griddle\nDimensions: 45.2 x 24.5 x 37.3 inches |Weight: 73.2 pounds |Total cooking area: 532 square inches |Cooking power: 34,000 BTUs Best for:\nNovice grillers\nSmall spaces\nAnyone on a budget\nSkip if:\nYou want a workhorse grill with plenty of features\nA reliable flat-top grill doesn\u2019t have to be a major investment.

The griddle is crafted from hot rolled steel\u2014a material Sidoriak recommends for longevity. The hinged lid is also made of heavy-duty steel to protect the grill from outdoor elements. Still, some owners report wobbliness with this model, so it may not be the best choice for someone who expects to use it heavily.\nBest Upgrade Flat-Top Grill\nSpacious, Versatile And Built For A Party\nBlackstone 36-inch Griddle Airfryer Combo\nDimensions: 42.1 x 34.7 x 27.2 inches |Weight: 249 pounds |Total cooking area: 768 square inches |Cooking power: 60,000 BTUs Best for:\nBig backyards\nFrequent entertainers\nYear-round outdoor cooks\nSkip if:\nYou\u2019re on a budget\nYou\u2019re looking for a basic flat-top grill model\nIf your backyard is the go-to spot in your neighborhood for big gatherings and barbecues, you probably need something versatile enough to suit any occasion. This Blackstone with built-in air fryers is \u201cjust a blast to use,\" according to Sidoriak, who praises it as his favorite flat-top grill.\nIt features two 4-quart air fryer drawers and a warming drawer to stretch its functionality and make it suitable for long days spent outdoors. \u201cWhether it\u2019s hot dogs or burgers, [the warming drawers] hold at temperature in the drawer,\u201d Sidoriak says. \u201cAnd with the air fryer, you can make tots, you can make fries, you can roast vegetables\u2014it\u2019s really great.\u201d\nThis grill is designed for entertaining, with four independently controlled heat zones and enough griddle space to cook 30 burgers at once. There\u2019s also plenty of built-in storage, including two side shelves, a magnetic toolbar for grilling utensils, two drawers and an enclosed cabinet. Everything sits on a base with four locking caster wheels, making this mammoth appliance easy to move around if needed. This model also features an electric push-button ignition to make the experience even more user-friendly (and non-intimidating).\nDimensions: 39.5 x 77 x 26.4 inches |Weight: 198 pounds |Total cooking area: 756 square inches |Cooking power: 48,000 BTUs\nBest for:\nFrequent backyard hosts\nSpacious outdoor spaces\nAnyone who wants to skip pre-seasoning and get started right away\nSkip if:\nYou want to close the lid to trap heat while cooking\nThis sleek Weber grill is designed with easy entertaining in mind. The spacious griddle is large enough to cook 30 burgers or 29 steaks at one time, and there are two roomy side tables, including one extendable one for extra counter space. There are also four independent heat sources that are easy to control with the knobs and a digital temperature display (the griddle can reach up to 500 degrees).\nThe cooktop on this grill is made from rust-resistant carbon steel that the brand claims has been altered with extreme heat and pressure\u2014not coatings\u2014to naturally resist rust forming. The material is also pre-seasoned with food-safe oils, so you can get grilling as soon as the Weber is set up in your yard.\nThere are a few other handy features, including wind guards and closed cabinet storage. Just keep in mind that although this model does include a hinged lid, the brand advises against closing it while the grill is hot\u2014it\u2019s designed for storage only.\nBest Compact Flat-Top Grill\nIntuitive And Efficient For Small Backyards And Patios\nChar-Griller Flat Iron 3-Burner Gas Griddle with Lid\nDimensions: 24.7 x 47 x 37.7 inches |Weight: 86.6 pounds |Total cooking area: 520 square inches |Cooking power: 36,000 BTUs\nBest for:\nSmall outdoor spaces\nMulti-zone cooking\nConvenient mobility\nSkip if:\nYou\u2019re looking for ample built-in storage\nThis compact griddle is smaller than our other top picks, but it\u2019s also mighty. It features three separate burners to fuel its 520 square-inch steel cooktop, which is surrounded by wind guards to maintain high temperatures. Each cooking zone is suited to either low, medium or high cooking, so you can whip up anything from delicate white fish to seared steaks.

The 520 square inches of cooking space may seem small, but it is still big enough to cook around 20 burgers at once, making it well suited to most backyard gatherings.\nBest Portable Flat-Top Grill\nAll The Benefits Of Blackstone, In A Small Package\nBlackstone 22-Inch Tabletop Griddle with Hood\nDimensions: 27 x 13 x 24.5 inches |Weight: 37.5 pounds | Total cooking area: 361 square inches |Cooking power: 21,000 BTUs Best for:\nSmall backyards or apartment balconies\nBringing on camping trips\nCouples or small households\nSkip if:\nYou need something lightweight\nYou don\u2019t need a huge backyard to take advantage of outdoor cooking. This compact, portable griddle is a great match for small outdoor spaces and apartment balconies, since it brings the same lauded Blackstone features in a small package. It features the brand\u2019s signature omnivore griddle with two independent heat zones and corresponding control knobs, so you can cook foods at two different temperatures at once. Although the cooking area is petite, it\u2019s still large enough to cook up to 14 burgers at once.\nSince this griddle is portable, it\u2019s great for bringing to tailgates and camping trips. But just because it\u2019s portable doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s lightweight and easy to carry around. This model weighs over 37 pounds, thanks to its heavy-duty stainless steel makeup\u2014so you\u2019d have to plan ahead if packing it for a trip.\nThe home team at Forbes Vetted is committed to offering the best recommendations for products both inside and outside of the home\u2014including the best grills\u2014to suit your specific needs.\nMonica Petrucci is the author of this piece and a commerce writer for Forbes Vetted. She has been testing and writing about home products, including grills and outdoor dinnerware, for the past several years.\nWe interviewed Paul Sidoriak, grillmaster and founder of Grilling Montana, who told us what features to look for in flat-top grills, how they differ from open-flame grills and which models he prefers\u2014all based on his own experience.\nWe consulted barbecue experts Maddie and Kiki Longo for their insight into the best brands on the market and what shoppers should look for when considering a flat-top grill.\nThe Forbes Vetted team is committed to keep all of our content current and helpful, providing regular updates as needed. This article was last updated in May 2025.\nHow We Chose The Best Flat-Top Grills\nWe dug into hours of research for this article, consulting experts and firsthand reviews in order to provide the most helpful information for shoppers.\nAlthough we evaluated and included a range of different brands, we prioritized Blackstone models, as that brand was highlighted as the best on the market by several experts.\nFollowing Sidoriak\u2019s advice, we prioritized models that include hinged lids for safe storage, as well as models with durable materials like rolled steel griddles (without fragile coatings like nonstick, which can flake off).\nWe pored over customer reviews to gather insights into each grill\u2019s real-world performance and longevity, taking that feedback into account with our ranking.\nWe made sure to include a variety of different flat-top griddle styles and sizes to satisfy customers\u2019 ranging needs and budgets.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nThere are plenty of reliable flat-top grill brands out there, but experts often rally behind one popular name when prompted. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to be objective and and not just get behind Blackstone wholeheartedly,\u201d Sidoriak says. \u201cThey continue to innovate with their products.\u201d\nBlackstone offers a wide variety of different flat-top grills to choose from\u2014from small portable models to basic and affordable grills to splurge-worthy models with a dizzying array of special features.\nAs long as you have the outdoor space for it, there\u2019s a strong argument to be made for the flat-top grill\u2014especially if you like spending time outdoors.\n\u201cThe flat-top is arguably more versatile than an open-fire grill,\u201d Sidoriak says. \u201cYou just can\u2019t cook pancakes on an open-fire grill\u2014unless you have a pan or a griddle on there. But you can still cook steaks and burgers and chicken, and all kinds of classic grill-ables, on a flat-top.\u201d That means if you\u2019re willing to put in the effort, you\u2019ll definitely get your money\u2019s worth out of this appliance.\nPlus, flat-top grills come in a variety of sizes and price points to suit virtually any outdoor space.\nThere are a lot of similarities between open-fire grilling and flat-top grilling, but there are also a couple of notable differences. For example, the Longos highlight the unique resulting flavor that comes solely from charcoal grilling. \u201cThat legendary nostalgic smoky flavor is the hallmark of that style of grill,\u201d they say. \u201cSince flat-tops are just big outdoor frying pans, the unit itself does not impart any unique flavor.\u201d"

In addition to our recommendations, we spoke with an expert on choosing the best bamboo sheets and how the material compares to other natural fibers like cotton or linen.\nSome reviewers comment they wrinkle easily due to the sateen weave\nHigh-quality bamboo sheets can easily run over $200, but the organic Bamboo Sheet Set from Quince utilizes premium bamboo viscose and a silky sateen weave for a luxurious feel at a great value. The material is Oeko-Tex Standard 100-certified, which means the brand upholds strict manufacturing standards set by a third-party organization and is free of harmful chemicals and substances. They have a silky-soft sateen weave and a 300-thread count, which \u201cgives these sheets a smooth silkiness and a nice luster,\u201d says one tester. \u201cThey\u2019ve held up beautifully, too, with no pilling or snags, even with dogs on the bed,\u201d she adds. Senior mattress and sleep editor Bridget Chapman also owns the pair and praises their comfort. Chapman says, \u201cThese sheets from Quince are so incredibly soft and have a nice weight to them where they\u2019re very breathable but not too thin nor too heavy.\u201d Shoppers can choose between 12 colorways, six sizes and can opt for a set with or without a flat sheet.\nBest Affordable Bamboo Sheets\nEnjoy A Drapey And Breathable Feel At A Nice Value\nMOST POPULAR\nBedsure Bamboo Sheet Set (Queen)\nMaterial: 100% rayon from bamboo | Thread count: 225 |Weave: Twill | Mattress depth: 16 inches\nPros:\n25 different colorways\nMost affordable option listed in our roundup\nEnvelope pillowcase enclosures\nCons:\nTwill weave is not as breathable as sateen\nYou don\u2019t have to splurge on bamboo bedding to get your hands on a quality pair. The Bamboo Sheets from Bedsure have a 4.4-star rating on Amazon with over 60,000 reviews and counting. They\u2019re made with rayon from bamboo and have a twill weave that\u2019s more durable and wrinkle-resistant than sateen, though it is more heavyweight and may sleep warmer than the Quince or Ettitude Bamboo Sets mentioned in our list. Although you\u2019re paying a lower price for the Bedsure Sheet Set, you don\u2019t have to compromise on comfort or safety, as the bedding is Oeko-Tes Standard 100-certified. According to the brand, a fitted sheet suits mattresses up to 16 inches tall and features a 360-degree elastic band for a tight fit. Plus, the pillowcases have envelope enclosures that keep your pillow more secure than open-ended cases.\nBest Deep-Pocket Bamboo Sheets\nA Breathable And Buttery Set That Gets Softer With Each Wash\nCozy Earth Bamboo Sheet Set (Queen)\nMaterial: 100% viscose from bamboo |Thread count: Not specified |Weave: Not specified |Mattress depth: 20 inches\nPros:\nOversized fit for a draped look or taller mattresses\nLong warranty and trial\nMade from high-quality bamboo viscose\nCons:\nMight be too loose for mattresses under 12 inches tall\nCozy Earth gained somewhat of a cult following after its best-selling Bamboo Sheets made Oprah\u2019s coveted Favorite Things List\u2014and thousands of reviewers confirm they\u2019re worth the splurge. Made with 100% viscose from bamboo, these sheets offer a buttery-soft and drapey feel that\u2019s lightweight and airy at the same time. I have been sleeping on these sheets for two years and they are constantly in my bedding rotation (especially in the summertime) as they\u2019re some of the softest, most comfortable linens I own. They\u2019ve also held up through countless cycles in the wash with very little pilling.\nWith a 20-inch-deep fitted sheet and an oversized fit, these linens fit big-and-tall mattresses best unless you\u2019re looking for a more relaxed and lived-in look for your bedding. Your purchase is accompanied by a 100-night risk-free trial and a ten-year limited warranty, which are uncommon and generous policies for bedding.\nBest Luxury Bamboo Sheets\nTheir Soft And Silky Feel Is A Dream For Hot Sleepers\nEttitude CleanBamboo Signature Sateen Sheet Set (Queen)\nWhile other brands utilize bamboo viscose or rayon, which undergo chemical processes during manufacturing and contain a synthetic blend, the Ettitude CleanBamboo Sheets contain bamboo lyocell, and the brand uses a patented nontoxic, closed-loop process. The bamboo is grown in FSC-certified forests using 100% rainwater and ultra sustainable farming methods. The result? A clean, irresistibly soft and smooth feel that the brand compares to a 1,100 thread count. I own these and think they match up to my Cozy Earth Set when it comes to softness, but they have a slightly more lightweight profile that\u2019s even more beneficial for people who sleep hot. For more details and testing insights, see my full Ettitude Sheets review.\nLengthy trial (101 nights) and warranty (lifetime)\nEquipped with elastic straps to ensure a secure fit\nCons:\nOnly two colorways available\nThe Puffy Signature Sheets Set is made with 100% bamboo viscose that\u2019s Oeko-Tex Standard 100-certified, a sateen weave and 300-thread count, giving them a fresh and cozy feel that Chapman loves. \u201cThese were the first bamboo sheets I owned and they got me hooked on the material,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re soft and breathable without sacrificing quality. They\u2019re a great value overall.\u201d Arguably the best part about these linens, besides their snuggly feel, are the elastic straps fixed on each corner of the fitted sheet that keeps it in place\u2013no slippage here. Not to mention, Puffy is the most flexible with its company policies, as you receive a 101-night trial and lifetime warranty on your sheets, and the brand offers the same deal on all of its products.\nFor a set of soft and breathable sheets that feels silky smooth to the touch, yet more substantial and durable than sateen, the Classic Bamboo Set from Cariloha fits the bill. It has a twill weave that should make it more durable and long-lasting than a sateen weave, and its slightly courser feel gets softer with each wash. The bamboo viscose is also sustainably sourced and backed by a list of green-friendly certifications including FSC, B Corporation and Fair Trade, which is a testament to the brand\u2019s commitment to sustainability, responsible farming and low environmental impact.\nI\u2019ve tried these sheets myself and think they offer a great value with a luxurious feel that reminds you of climbing into a soft, 5-star hotel bed. I also appreciate the straps on each corner of the fitted sheet, which saves me the hassle of tugging and pulling it back into place each night. Cariloha doesn\u2019t offer as vast a color selection as some brands, but limited-edition colorways can pop up.\nWe have a vast library of mattress and sleep content from seasoned writers and editors who built it from the ground up.

Here\u2019s how we identified the best bamboo sheets that are worth the money.\nWe sorted through dozens of sheet sets online from our favorite and trusted brands as well as top-sellers on Amazon with overwhelmingly positive customer reviews.\nWe prioritized bamboo sheet sets from companies who place value on sustainability and eco-friendliness. We also took softness, weave and thread count into consideration.\nWe relied on our own firsthand experience with testing the best bamboo sheets on the market and included insights from our editors who stand behind their picks.\nWe routinely revisit our content to ensure that it remains accurate and relevant. This article was first published in July 2025.\nWhat To Consider When Shopping For The Best Bamboo Sheets\nIf you\u2019re a hot sleeper looking for temperature relief or you simply prefer eco-friendly linens, here are the main things to consider for bamboo bedding.\nTemperature\nBamboo bedding ensures heat doesn\u2019t get trapped within the microclimate under your sheets. According to Phoebe Street, brand marketing manager at luxury nightwear brand Pretty You London, \u201cThey breathe better, allowing air to flow freely and helping to regulate your body temperature,\u201d she says. In addition to bamboo\u2019s subtly cool and smooth profile, \u201cit pulls moisture away from your skin, helping you stay dry and comfortable through the night, even if you\u2019re a little sweaty,\u201d she continues. In addition to bamboo, she recommends cotton and linen sheets for hot sleepers, \u201cbut they don\u2019t wick moisture quite as well as bamboo.\u201d Natural fibers also make some of the best bedding and sleep material because of their hypoallergenic properties.\nWeave\nA sheet\u2019s weave helps determine its feel and refers to the pattern in which its threads are interwoven. The most common weaves for bamboo sheets are sateen, percale and twill, and each one comes with its own benefits and drawbacks. Sateen is known for being silky, smooth and buttery with a slight sheen. Percale is a common weave for hotel sheets and delivers a cool and crisp feel. Twill is more structured like percale, and tends to be more coarse than sateen.\nThread Count\nAlthough thread count isn\u2019t the end-all-be-all measurement for softness and quality in sheets, it does contribute to bedding\u2019s general feel. The higher the thread count, the more substantial and soft they feel, so we recommend that hot sleepers opt for sheets with lower thread counts that provide a more lightweight feel. \u201cAim for a thread count between 200 and 400,\u201d says Street. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the whole story. What matters more than the number is the quality of the fibers and the weave.\u201d\nViscose Vs. Rayon Vs. Lyocell\nBamboo requires less water than cotton, naturally regenerates and grows quicker than cotton, which is why it\u2019s deemed a more sustainable bedding material. However, viscose and rayon from bamboo must undergo certain chemical treatments to be manufactured into fabric, while fabric from bamboo lyocell is made in a closed-loop system that requires less water and has a lower environmental impact.\nCare\nTo avoid shrinking your bamboo sheets in the wash, most brands recommend you use a cold temperature setting on delicate and tumble dry on low. Remember to remove your linens from the dryer as soon as you can to help minimize wrinkles, and avoid using dryer balls on bamboo, which contribute to pilling.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWe named the Ettitude Bamboo Sheets the best luxury pair because of their soft and silky feel, and the brand\u2019s sustainable practices throughout the manufacturing process and supply chain.\nAside from being more costly than your typical cotton sheets, bamboo can also be prone to wrinkles and more cumbersome to care for.\nMost of the time, but be sure to check your bedding\u2019s care instructions before throwing it in. A majority of brands say to tumble dry on low, and avoid using dryer balls to help keep your sheets from piling.\nCoupons\nOwala\nGet 20% Off Sitewide During The Back-To-School Sale"
