  "content": "MUMS have been raving about a \u00a313 buy that stops kids from getting nits.\n\nWith the kids going back to school this week, after six long weeks off, many parents are likely to notice that their kids come home with little critters in their hair.\n\nSeptember is usually the worst time of year for nits, as when children go back to school, they have increased exposure with other kids.\n\nAlthough nits are not harmful to kids, they can cause itchiness and irritation, and can easily be passed on to the whole family.\n\nThe tiny creatures can be incredibly difficult to get rid of, but one mum has revealed a \u00a313 solution, that should stop them from getting on to your child's head.\n\nPosting to TikTok, a mum named @hannahsfamilylife, revealed that she was making a DIY nit potion, from tea tree oil, a carrier oil and water.\n\nThere is no conclusive evidence to suggest that tea tree oil can prevent nits, so TikTokers raced to the video's comments section to share alternative methods.\n\nOne mum said: \"I used Nitty Gritty on my sons hair and he didn't catch nits.\n\n\"Definitely a good idea to try and prevent it.\"\n\nNitty Gritty Conditioning Head Lice Defence Spray is priced at \u00a312.99, and was created by mums, to stop head lice from taking over kids' heads.\n\nHead lice use their sense of smell to detect a new head to climb on to, so Nitty Gritty works by masking the scent of hair, to create an unappealing environment for the lice.\n\nTo use the eco-friendly product, simply spritz it on to your child's head every morning before school or nursery.\n\nNitty Gritty said: \"We recommend daily use of our Nitty Gritty Conditioning Defence Spray to keep those pesky lice from crawling back on to your little one\u2019s heads.\n\n\"It's a carefully chosen blend of ingredients with a lovely grapefruit scent, that smells great to us, but not so great to head lice!\n\n\"It not only keeps those pesky lice at bay but keeps everyone's hair fragranced, soft, shiny, de-tangled and in tip-top condition.\"\n\nHow to prevent an outbreak of nits THE Hairforce\u2019s Dee Wright shares her top tips to nip a nit outbreak in the bud. GO PUBLIC: Nits are not a dirty secret. If you tell other parents you\u2019ve found lice, they know to do an extra check on their own kids and catch them before they get out of control. GET A NIT CHECK ROUTINE IN PLACE: Make a \u201cnit check\u201d part of your weekly routine. Use a good-quality nit comb, like Nitty Gritty nit comb, inset, \u00a38.52 reduced from \u00a313, at Amazon. DO EXTRA CHECKS AFTER NIT \u201cDANGER POINTS\u201d: If your child has been at an event where they have been closer than usual to other children, do an extra head check. Events such as school trips, parties and sleepovers are all ideal breeding grounds for head lice. DON\u2019T TAKE SHORTCUTS: When you buy a product to treat lice, make sure you follow the instructions carefully. Don\u2019t neglect doing a second treatment a week later, even if you can\u2019t see any signs of eggs. This is how lice cases get out of control. IT\u2019S NOT ONLY YOUNG KIDS: People often only check their primary school-aged children for head lice, but older children and adults can bring them into the home too. It is important that the whole family checks their hair every week.\n\nThe Nitty Gritty website is flooded with reviews from satisfied parents, who have rated the product five stars.\n\nOne mum said: \"My daughter has long hair and using the spray is part of our morning routine before school. Year 5 now and no nits.\n\n\"It's the one thing I recommend to friends for their family.\"\n\nA second person said: \"Since I started using this well over 2 years ago my daughter has never got nits.\"\n\nA third person said: \"Bought at the start of an outbreak at school.\n\n\"So far seems to be working!\"",
