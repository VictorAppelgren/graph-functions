  "description": "On August 22nd, the sun leaves the limelight fantasy of Leo for the sharp eye of Virgo, and romantic relationships are getting a deep dose of reality.",
  "content": "The sun is sliding out of the limelight lion\u2019s den of Leo and into the pull your weight and pull no punches fields of Virgo, and our relationships are primed to become an exercise in separating the wheat from the chaff.\n\nWhile Leo season had us looking for a co-star, Virgo brings a bigger picture of compatibility into focus, shifting us from romance to realism, performance to practicality.\n\nNow is the hour when couples who\u2019ve been coasting on chemistry are suddenly confronted with the nit and grit \u2014 be it a beard hair in the sink or an uncomfortable discord about political issues.\n\n\u201cThe Sun\u2019s entry into Virgo invites a more grounded perspective on relationships. It\u2019s a period for assessing the underlying structure of your connection \u2014 how you communicate, coordinate, and support each other in daily life.\n\nThis is the kind of practical alignment that determines whether a relationship can sustain itself beyond the initial excitement,\u201d Angelika Koch, astrologer and relationshp expert at Taimi told The Post.\n\nAccording to Koch, the momentum of Virgo season ain\u2019t about killing the vibe \u2014 but deciding if you can handle the reality that lives when the fantasy fades.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about romance disappearing \u2014 it\u2019s about seeing if the fantasy can hold up under real-life conditions. Can you merge calendars without chaos? Can you have an honest talk about money without tension? Those are very Virgo-season questions.\u201d\n\nVirgo is the sign of divine discernment and in kind, now more than ever we are able to see the cracks in our bonds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to see things clearly during Virgo season, since this is a Mercury-ruled earth sign all about solving problems from a logical standpoint. Because of this, romantic relationships often fall under a harsher scrutiny,\u201d explained Koch.\n\nShe shared that when Virgo rules the skies, conflict can present, often as a result of people trying to \u201cfix\u201d what\u2019s not working in a romantic dynamic or hyper focusing on the failings of a partner, alienating and aggrevating them in the process.\n\nIf these issues are approached with enthusiasm for solution rather than exasperation with the issue, Koch assures the results can be downright rosy.\n\n\u201cIf you can navigate the small stuff, like who takes out the trash or how you plan your weekends, you\u2019re actually preparing your relationship for the long haul. It\u2019s the little habits, not just the grand gestures, that determine how sustainable your love really is,\u201d she said.\n\nThe good news? Virgo was born with a can do, let\u2019s fix it energy \u2014 meaning as long as both parties are willing to be honest and accountable, there\u2019s no limit to how much growth can transpire or how good it can get.\n\nAstrologer Reda Wigle researches and irreverently reports back on planetary configurations and their effect on each zodiac sign. Her horoscopes integrate history, poetry, pop culture, and personal experience. To book a reading, visit her website.",

      "text": "Dot your i\u2019s and cross your t\u2019s, my babies, ruling the skies from August 22 \u2013 September 22, but running the show every damn day is Virgo.\nA mutable earth sign, Virgo energy is discerning; it\u2019s about acts of service, the controlled cure, and the vision of things not as they are but as they could be.\nVirgo is ever operating from intention rather than impulse; words are measured, actions weighed. In some ways, it is the sign of our better angels and divine potential.\nWhat are Virgos like?\nThey make it look easy, folks, but they work very, very hard.\nAs an earth sign, they aren\u2019t concerned with acquisition and comfort like Taurus nor building a legacy like Capricorn.\nVirgo wishes to be useful.\nVirgo shares the spirit of caretaking with the cardinal water sign Cancer, but while crabs want to tend to others, Virgo wants to teach them how to tend to and fend for themselves.\nConsider Virgo musician Buddy Bolden, lauded as the father of jazz; his style of playing was so powerfully original that it birthed an entirely new genre.\nYet, not a single recording of his exists today.\nThe ballad of Bolden suggests what Virgos innately understand, that the evidence of genius is measured in the enduring echo of influence.\nVirgo is the most common zodiac sign by the numbers, but their earth-born medicine and practical magic are wholly unusual when distilled and distributed.\nIn a nod to the uncommon but common, the lesson for Virgo is perhaps best expressed by one of their own, the poet Mary Oliver.\nThough her poem \u201cWild Geese\u201d is well-read, oft-quoted, and taped to many a dorm room wall, it is a message that bears repeating.\n\u201cYou do not have to be good.\nYou do not have to walk on your knees\nFor a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.\nYou only have to let the soft animal of your body\nlove what it loves.\nTell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.\nMeanwhile the world goes on.\nMeanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain\nare moving across the landscapes,\nover the prairies and the deep trees,\nthe mountains and the rivers.\nMeanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,\nare heading home again.\nWhoever you are, no matter how lonely,\nthe world offers itself to your imagination,\ncalls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting \u2014\nover and over announcing your place\nin the family of things.\u201d\nAs Oliver intimates, Virgos shine when they can abandon themselves without hesitation or self-hatred to the purity of their primal selves, exchange pain with others, and conspire with the wilderness within and around them. In doing so, they offer the rest of us a standard of humility, wholeness, and humanity to which we can aspire.\nPlanetary ruler: Mercury\nVirgo is ruled by Mercury, the planet of consciousness and communication.\nNamed for the messenger of the gods, Mercury also rules Gemini, but the planet\u2019s energy manifests itself differently in each sign.\nFor airy Gemini, Mercury is about the rapid exchange and absorption of information and the search for answers. For Virgo, an earth sign, the influence of Mercury is equally curious but more vested in practical solutions.\nHere, Mercury brings awareness to the material plane, and natives are adept at seeing not only what is but what could be. Mercury obeys reason more than emotion, which lends Virgo a critical lens and an objective approach to problem-solving.\nVirgos have an undue reputation for being uptight when, in fact, the influence of Mercury in conjunction with their mutable modality lends itself to highly affable and relentlessly adaptable folks.\nVirgo is willing to change their mind, methods, or macrobiotic diet if it makes sense or allows them to be of greater help to others. To that end, Mercury governs service and daily routines. These people want to be useful, to do well, and to be well.\nNot for nothing, nun organizing, poor aiding, Nobel Peace Prize-winning humanitarian Mother Teresa was a Virgo, and International Make Your Bed Day falls during Virgo season.\nI rest my case.\nMythology\nThe largest of all the zodiac constellations, Virgo has many mythic ties but is most often associated with the story of the earth goddess Demeter and her daughter Persephone. Once upon a time, the world lived in an unending season of spring, with Demeter, the goddess of grain, ensuring that all things stayed in full bloom, full time.\nSeasons changed, and winter came when Persephone was abducted by hell daddy Hades and taken to the underworld to be his bride.\nBereft at the loss of her daughter, Demeter cast the earth into barrenness. She beseeched Zeus to return Persephone, and he appealed to his brother Hades. A deal was struck, and Persephone was permitted to leave the underworld on the condition that she ate nothing until she returned to the land of the living.\nReports vary, but either Hades, the dubious character that he is, purposely gave Persephone a pomegranate seed to suck on, or she ate it willingly, preferring to be a queen of the dead over being infantilized above ground. Thus, Persephone was returned to her mother but was forced to return to the underworld for four months every year.\nThis cycle of surrender and return explains the change of seasons; winter reigns when Persephone dwells in the underworld, and spring returns when she is reunited with her mother. The alignment between Virgo and Persephone/Demeter is reflected in the sign\u2019s sense of duty and service, willingness to go to hell and back, and a propensity for choosing subpar partners at every turn.\nCharms/strengths\nApex Virgo and repentant aristocrat Leo Tolstoy wrote, \u201cThe truth is obtained like gold, not by letting it grow bigger, but by washing off from it everything that isn\u2019t gold.\u201d\nWith this sentiment, Tolstoy points to one of the high-shine strengths of the Virgo ilk: discernment.\nVirgos are naturally adept at divining value, sensing faults, and recognizing potential in all things and all people. This translates to the tendency to be preoccupied with refinement and perfection. This tendency can come across as judgment or critique but is more about observation and assessment than condemnation.\nThey aren\u2019t judging you; they\u2019re seeing you. Moreover, what they see makes them want to help. While Virgo is absolutely about pushing an agenda and keeping order, the soft belly of that bullying is a desire for efficiency and efficacy that benefits the collective.\nVirgos are not in it for the glory and rarely pause to appreciate what they\u2019ve achieved, fixed as they are on what else can be done. Further, adversity is akin to diesel fuel for Virgos, who thrive on being underestimated like Virgo GOAT Jesse Owens.\nTo that end, Virgos, like all earth signs, are built to endure, though they often take on and take more s**t than necessary.\nPoised and averse to high-octane drama, Virgos are rarely messy, especially when falling apart. Adept at survival and allergic to looking weak, they want their suffering to have meaning, to benefit others, and to stand as an example of what can be overcome.\nWe see this modality in Virgo Evan Rachel Wood, whose own experience of abuse led her to become an activist on behalf of other victims and survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence. Her efforts led to the passing of the Phoenix Act, which extends the statute of limitations for sexual assault survivors.\nWhen it comes to making a stand, making art, and making their way through the world, Virgos don\u2019t showboat; they just show up.\nAs Beyonc\u00e9 explained to Vogue Magazine, \u201cI\u2019m not alive unless I am creating something. I\u2019m not happy if I\u2019m not creating, if I\u2019m not dreaming, if I\u2019m not creating a dream and making it into something real. I\u2019m not happy if I\u2019m not improving, evolving, moving forward, inspiring, teaching, and learning.\u201d\nIndeed, the process of creating and evolving is more important to Virgo than the product of that trajectory. For further evidence of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s incomparable Virgoness, watch this clip, where our regal earth queen gets her hair caught in a fan onstage and doesn\u2019t panic, stop the show, or miss a single god***n beat.\nImbued with relentless imagination, Virgos are natural world builders; we see this expressed in artists, writers, and proud power-playing geeks like Tim Burton, Roald Dahl, Stephen King, Tyler Perry, and George R.R. Martin.\nThe influence of Mercury makes Virgos clever and quick but also prone to anxiety, overthinking, questioning text messages they sent ten years ago, and tensing at the thought that they have been wrong or done wrong. Their preoccupation with cleanliness, order, spotless floors, and color-coded condiments is a way to divert and expend this mental energy.\nThe taxing, contemplative nature of the Virgo mind is beautifully personified by the viral Sad Keanu meme.\nOur boy is a Virgo, and he\u2019s got a lot to think about, folks, not least of all the legion of people having sex with his avatar and how to redistribute the cash he has earned but doesn\u2019t think he needs or deserves.\nBless.\nSome upshots of the overactive mind of team Virgo are that they remember everything and are absolutely hilarious, making high art of self-deprecation.\nMore than happy to ruminate over the personal problems of others and themselves, they are excellent at giving advice, shining light, showing levity, and providing practical solutions to pressing problems. We love you, Virgo, and we see you too.\nChallenges/weaknesses\nThe very desire for betterment that drives Virgos can also paralyze their progress. Needing something to be perfect before it can be seen and shared is a bit of a blessing/bane among this contingent, and they tend to get in their own way.\nAdditionally, for all of their prodigious talents and gifts of discernment, they fail to see their worth. This makes them endearingly modest and infuriatingly hard on themselves. Many secretly fear that they are not fun and are somehow unlovable.\nThere\u2019s a bit of a \u201cnobody likes me, everybody hates me, I guess I\u2019ll go eat worms\u201d vibe here, except they won\u2019t eat worms because their bellies are preternaturally vulnerable to upset.\nWe\u2019ve established that Virgos are adept at seeing where and when things can be improved, but their keen vision and \u201chelpful\u201d insights can only be received and applied if their perspective is invited.\nNot everyone can stand to be seen, and natives would do well to tread lightly and make suggestions gently.\nAlong these same lines, the Virgo ability to see what could be rather than what is lends itself to them routinely slumming it in romantic relationships. These people view derelict houses and derelict romantic partners as irresistible DIY projects, looking at you, LeAnn Rimes, Lala Kent, and Amy Winehouse.\nOf Virgo director Werner Herzog, critic Roger Ebert once said, \u201cEven his failures are spectacular.\u201d A sentiment that rings true for his zodiac brethren.\nVirgo\u2019s tenacity is astounding when applied to constructive and/or creative pursuits and downright staggering when they put it towards their unmaking. Case in point, the arch of cocaine-snorting, tiger blood drinking, goddess bedding Charlie Sheen or George \u201cI will ride this lawn mower to the bar if you hide my car keys\u201d Jones.\nSome of the most illustrious trash monsters in history have been Virgos, including Caligula, the ever-industrious Ed Gein, and Ivan the Terrible, who was described as \u201cintelligent and devout but also prone to paranoia, rage, and episodic outbreaks of mental instability that increased with age.\u201d\nAll in line with low vibrational Virgo energy.\nTarot\nIn the Major Arcana of the tarot, Virgo is represented by the Hermit. The card depicts a cloaked, bearded figure atop a solitary mountain, holding out a lantern.\nThe figure can be interpreted as a shamanic father time type, and the lantern as the light of truth and consciousness. The Hermit card carries a spiritual connotation, suggesting that it is through separating the self from the masses and retreating into the richness of reflection and the natural world that cures can be found and wisdom sought.\nFully formed, wholly himself, and with the vantage of the mountaintop, the card, like the sign, serves to remind us that when we look within, we never feel without.\nThe energy of the Hermit card is distilled by writer, super freak, and fellow Virgo D.H. Lawrence, who espoused,\n\u201cThis is what I believe: That I am I. That my soul is a dark forest. That my known self will never be more than a little clearing in the forest. That gods, strange gods, come forth from the forest into the clearing of my known self and then go back. That I must have the courage to let them come and go. I will never let mankind put anything over me, but I will always try to recognize and submit to the gods in me and the gods in other men and women. There is my creed.\u201d\nAnd so, too, is it the creed and the cure for Virgo; nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect; we honor the clearing in the forest by bowing to the godly, resisting the lowly, and exalting in the knowledge we find between.\nAstrology 101: Your guide to the stars\n- The 12 zodiac signs\n- What are the astrology houses?\n- Here\u2019s what each planet represents\n- Sun, moon and rising signs: Get to know your Big 3\nSixth House\nVirgo rules the sixth house of service and survival.\nCommonly called the house of health, the sixth house concerns itself with our ability to maintain ourselves and keep the true north of our bodies amid crisis, illness, and discontent.\nIt ain\u2019t all green tea, colonics, and billowing linen pants, folks; it\u2019s about how we build ourselves back from devastation, how that journey shapes us, and how we can apply that knowledge to help others. This is where and how service and health begin their braiding. We need strength to serve others, but our frailty teaches us what it means to need.\nThe lesson of the Sixth House is to integrate mental, physical, and spiritual energy and to balance self-care and acts of service so that we can fill up and pour from the same proverbial cup.\nBody\nIn relationship to the physical body, Virgo rules the abdomen, spleen, and digestive system. This lends itself to natives relying on their strong \u201cgut\u201d instincts and a tendency to feel emotional upset, stress, and anxiety in their bellies first.\nSensitive to what others say and the food they eat, the great Virgo gift of order is best applied to a clean diet that keeps their bodies functioning like the temples they are, rather than the truck stops they can be.\nCompatibility\nTrue astrological compatibility is divined through synastry, a kind of birth chart cross-examination that considers the entire astrological scape of two individuals. For general, expedited purposes, it\u2019s safe to say the following signs stand a good chance of going the distance with a Virgo:\nVirgo and Gemini are both mutable signs, meaning natives are highly adaptable and prone to changing their minds, plans, and middle names.\nRuled by Mercury, the planet of intellect and exchange, these two prioritize communication and find in the other a mental match. For evidence, look no further than Virgo high priestess Zendaya and her Gemini main piece, Tom Holland.\nNo one understands the complexity, obsessions, and dedicated spirit of a Virgo better than a fellow Virgo. We see this common sign and uncommon bond distilled in musician Nick Cave and his designer wife, Susie Bick. Together for decades, they operate as mutual muses to one another and, we suspect, keep an impeccably organized home and curated closet.\nVirgo and Taurus are a pair of earth signs that don\u2019t balk at hard work or the harder aspects of a relationship. This is a ride-or-die coupling that goes for miles; see Virgo Jimmy Fallon and his wife Nancy Juvonen and bull king Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson and his Virgo lady love Lauren Hashian.\nVirgo and Cancer are the uncontested caretakers of the zodiac, and in each other, they find the reciprocity they deserve. This is the match of tended home fires, a relationship of retreat and restoration. We see this dynamic at work in the longtime love between Virgo Lisa Van and Cancer business partner and househusband Ken Todd.\nRecommended Listening\n\u201cI\u2019m Your Man\u201d \u2013 Leonard Cohen\n\u201cFormation\u201d \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9\n\u201cWhat Kind of Man\u201d \u2013 Florence + the Machine\n\u201cWork Hard Play Hard\u201d \u2013 Wiz Khalifa\n\u201cLove Is A Losing Game\u201d \u2013 Amy Winehouse\n\u201cTry A Little Tenderness\u201d \u2013 Otis Redding\nAstrologer Reda Wigle researches and irreverently reports back on planetary configurations and their effect on each zodiac sign.

      "text": "In his controversial novel \u201cAmerican Psycho,\u201d Pisces Brett Easton Ellis writes, \u201cIt strikes me profoundly that the world is more often than not a bad and cruel place.\u201d\nGiven the popularity of true crime as entertainment and our cultural fascination with serial killers, it would seem we as people crave constant confirmation of that cruelty.\nResearch suggests there is a biological imperative to our consumption of true crime. Scientists theorize that the more we learn about dangerous people, the easier they are to recognize in the wild (often by their eyewear) and the less likely we are to become victims; a preparatory edge in the game of survival if you will.\nBut can knowing someone\u2019s zodiac sign help suss out whether they are built to kill?\nWell folks, we are all born capable of terror or transcendence, love or fear and there is no single point, placement or aspect in a birth chart that indicates someone will kill another person.\nAs the ancient adage maintains, \u201cthe stars incline us, they do not bind us,\u201d and the conditions that make for a killer are environmental and include early signs of psychological dysfunction and a home life peppered with sexual or physical abuse and drug/alcohol addiction.\nMuch of this article was inspired by the research of Dr. Jan Ruis, who, in doing the work of the people, analyzed the birth charts of three hundred serial killers. Using the criteria of the FBI, Ruis defines a serial killer as a person who commits two or more murders in separate events, effectively excluding those who have committed mass murder events, as well as governmental or political leaders.\nJust as specific childhood behaviors, namely bed wetting, animal torture, isolation, fire starting and chronic lying present themselves in the profiles of prolific murderers, Ruis hypothesized there may be certain astrological signs, energies, influences and aspects that occur more frequently in the kill for thrill populous.\nSpoiler alert: Scorpios ain\u2019t as dangerous as we\u2019ve been lead to believe.\nRead on to learn more. Bear in mind that regardless of the stars we fall under or the dark hands we\u2019re dealt in the game of life, free will reigns supreme.\nMutability and murder\nIn astrology, the signs are divided into three modalities; cardinal, which initiates, fixed which stabilizes and mutable which adapts. Ruis\u2019 research revealed that the majority of serial killers belong not to one specific sign, but to the mutable modality. Here\u2019s looking at you Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces.\nMutable signs fall always at the end of a season and signify transformation, a metaphor for death if ever there was one. Mutable signs are known for short attention spans, chameleonic tendencies and a dangerously low threshold for boredom, a reasonable combo for criminal cruelty.\nFamous mutable murderers include Jeffrey Dahmer (Gemini), Ed \u201cPsycho\u201d Gein (Virgo), killer clown John Wayne Gacy (Pisces), Ted Bundy (Sagittarius), Aileen \u201cMonster\u201d Wuornos (Pisces), Charles Starkweather (Sagittarius), Larry \u201cInterstate Killer\u201d Eyler (Sagittarius), David \u201cSon of Sam\u201d Berkowitz (Gemini), Richard \u201cNight Stalker\u201d Ramirez (Pisces), Andrew Cunanan (Virgo), Otis Toole, Albert \u201cBoston Strangler\u201d DeSalvo (Virgo), Randy \u201cFreeway Killer\u201d Kraft (Pisces), and Dennis \u201cBTK\u201d Rader (Pisces).\nThe mutable signs are ruled by Mercury, Jupiter and Neptune, respectively. Mercury is associated with thought patterns, communication and mania, Jupiter with abundance and excess and Neptune with dreams and delusion.\nAs Ruis, the serial killers considered express some of the darker tendencies of their planetary rulers, \u201cAs adults they are addicted to their fantasies (Neptune), have a lack of empathy, a constant urge for stimuli (Mercury), a lack of external goals in life, a low self-control (Jupiter) and a low sense of personal power.\nThe lack of empathy or remorse (Neptune), the superficial charm (Mercury) and the inflated self-appraisal (Jupiter) are features of psychopathy.\u201d\nGEMINI (May 21 \u2013 June 20)\nGeminis have cunning minds and curious imaginations that at best make them lively conversationalists and original thinkers. On the murder tip these inclinations are liable to produce a hyper verbal killer who writes their own fan mail, taunts the police and blames their crimes on satanic dogs like \u201cSon of Sam\u201d slayer David Berkowitz.\nVIRGO (August 23 \u2013 September 22)\nMutable earth, Virgos are an industrious and exacting sort, obsessed with details, finding patterns, synthesizing information and improving everything and everyone they come in contact with. They shine as detectives, attentive partners and coset organizers and swing terribly low in the form of methodical, mother loving, skin suit making psychopath Ed Gein. I maintain that there are probably far more Virgo serial killers who have eluded justice based on precision, planning and immaculate crime scenes.\nCheck out more of The Post\u2019s food astrology content:\n- Here\u2019s which beer embodies your zodiac sign\n- What kind of pizza are you based on your zodiac sign?\n- What wine are you based on your zodiac sign?\nSAGITTARIUS (November 22 \u2013 December 21)\nSagittarius folk are Jupiter ruled, prone to excess and adventure and positively euphoric when engaged in risky behavior. This can manifest as a polyamorous, road trip loving, good time having, tall tale telling gambler type, or as serial killer and double Sagittarius (sun and moon) Ted Bundy.\nNew York Post readers also love:\n- Here\u2019s which Marvel character you are based on your zodiac sign\n- Here\u2019s which \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 character you are based on your zodiac sign\n- Here\u2019s which \u2018Star Wars\u2019 character embodies your zodiac sign\n- What action hero are you based on your zodiac sign?\nPISCES (February 19 \u2013 March 20)\nPisces people are deeply in tune with the collective consciousness and ride the currents of dreams and the tidal pull of nightmares; this can exhibit itself as cloud painting, lavender loving, poetry spewing ennui or run of the mill nihilism. Pisces people are prone to letting their emotions and delusions run rough shod over them and at its darkest expression that looks like living with voices while living out violent sexual fantasies like Richard Ramirez and crazed clown John Wayne Gacy.\nThe Twelfth House\nIn astrology, the twelfth house is the last in the wheel and represents the unconscious mind, escape, endings, mysticism and the badlands between reality and release. This house is the domain of hotels, hospitals, prisons, creatures of the night, psychological torture and ghosts of the literal and metaphorical variety. The house of unseen enemies, self undoing, addiction and delusion, Ruis\u2019s study found this house to be hot bed of planetary activity in the birth charts of killers.\nConflicting evidence\nAnother study, conducted by ZodiacSign.com found that water signs, Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces plus mutable fire sign Sagittarius were tied for most murderous, accounting for forty percent of serial killers considered. The same study found that Capricorns, while not the most represented sign overall, accounted for the greatest number of victims. Leave it to the ever striving sea goat to overachieve.\nI would argue that Caps are gain-motivated killers, equally inspired by greed and sadism, ever looking to secure assets or cement status, like Marcel Petiot. Aries kill because they have poor impulse control, black out when angry and/or believe the killing is heroic/merciful like Herbert \u2018murder prevents earthquakes\u2019 Mullin.\nCancers kill because they are generally emotionally unstable and must destroy what they can\u2019t control. Leos kill for love or limelight, Libras for street cred/because their significant other told them to (Bonnie Parker was a Libra.) Scorpios commit murder for the same reason they do anything at all, to assert supremacy and to see if they can get away with it, like Gary Francis Postea, posthumously believed to be The Zodiac Killer. Last but not least, Aquarians rarely kills and are loathe to get blood on their space suits/lab coats/metallic boots; they see murder as an animal impulse far beneath them, preferring to let lesser minion carry out their dark deeds.\nTaurus as the low key killer\nSome reports claim Taurus takes the cake for kill count but these people aren\u2019t really motivated by murder as prison food is universally bad and cleaning up a crime scene is an awful lot of work\u2026 which may be exactly why they get caught.\nKiller bulls include but are not limited to con artist horror house builder H.H. Holmes, Michael Ryan, David Copeland, Karla Homolka, Albert Fish, Levi Bellfield, Orville Lynn Majors, Robert Black, Steve Wright, and Martha Beck. If we extend the scope of murder to include politicians and cult leaders, the blood and the body count doth rise in these pastures as Pol Pot, Adolf Hitler, Vladimir Lenin, Saddam Hussein, and Jim \u2018drink the Kool-Aid\u2019 Jones were all Tauruses.\nI hope what you\u2019ve read has shed some light on the darker parts of the human psyche. May it make you kind and keep you alive.\nAstrology 101: Your guide to the stars\n- The 12 zodiac signs\n- What are the astrology houses\n- Here\u2019s what each planet represents\n- Sun, moon, and rising signs: Get to know your Big 3\nAstrologer Reda Wigle researches and irreverently reports back on planetary configurations and their effect on each zodiac sign.

There is also a fee-based premium membership that unlocks additional features, at reasonable pricing. Once you have downloaded our app and begun to explore its features, you can choose to remain in the free domain or enhance your options through the premium app membership.\nProtecting user personal data is one of our top priorities.
