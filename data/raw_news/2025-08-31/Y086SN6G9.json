  "description": "Five-year-old Pulsing Ajnera was playing with his brothers in a field near their home in the western Indian state of Gujarat, when a lion \u201ccame out of nowhere,\u201d his grieving father told CNN.",
  "content": "Five-year-old Pulsing Ajnera was playing with his brothers in a field near their home in the western Indian state of Gujarat, when a lion \u201ccame out of nowhere,\u201d his grieving father told CNN.\n\n\u201cThis lion grabbed the child, my youngest, and left. My family tried everything to rescue him. They threw stones at the lion and a few wooden sticks as well, but (it) dragged him into the jungle,\u201d Heera Ajnera said. The boy\u2019s body was later recovered.\n\nPulsing was one of seven people in India killed by lions in the year to June 2025, taking the total number of fatal attacks in five years to more than 20. Attacks on cattle have almost doubled during the same period, Gujarat officials told CNN.\n\nSporting an unmistakable dark mane and unique folds of skin along their bellies, Asiatic lions are slightly smaller than their African cousins. They once prowled the Middle East and Asia but now Gujarat is home to the world\u2019s last population of wild Asiatic lions.\n\nThe lions were hunted to the brink of extinction in India, before a ban on killing the cats was put in place in Gujarat a century ago. Recent conservation efforts, have seen the state\u2019s lion population rise by 30% to 891 in the last five years.\n\nConservationists say a large part of the success stems from a unique human-lion relationship, where locals profit from the presence of lions, and lions are given space to roam. But that symbiotic relationship is being tested as the lion population grows.\n\n\u201cLions have been found in basement parking lots of hotels\u2026on top of people\u2019s homes. They are resting on terraces. They\u2019re sitting there and roaring,\u201d said wildlife biologist Ravi Chellam, the coordinator of conservation network the Biodiversity Collaborative.\n\n\u201cThe minute a lion moves into human-dominated habitats, the probability (of it attacking humans) just increases,\u201d he said.\n\nFor more than a decade, Chellam and other conservationists have been pushing the Gujarat government to move some lions to a second habitat outside the state.\n\nBut Gujarat\u2019s lions haven\u2019t gone anywhere, and their numbers are continuing to grow \u2013 creating the potential for conflict \u2013 despite a Supreme Court ruling ordering the government to relocate them.\n\nGir National Park \u2013 a 545-square-mile protected area about the size of Los Angeles City \u2013 was established in 1965 to protect endangered species, including Asiatic lions. Most of Gujarat\u2019s Asiatic lions now live outside the park\u2019s borders, mixing with humans in towns and villages.\n\n\u201cTheoretically, it\u2019s a success story because that was the whole intention of a conservation project \u2013 to increase the number of individuals of that species,\u201d Gujarat-based conservationist Jehan Bhujwala told CNN.\n\n\u201cBut when you have too many animals, they claim space outside of the protected area\u2026 and then they start coming into conflict with local (people),\u201d he said.\n\nBhujwala says India\u2019s conservation model was never intended to separate lions from humans, noting that villages are built within national parks.\n\n\u201cThey all coexisted, and that coexistence, that tolerance, is something which is very unique to India\u2019s conservation history,\u201d he said.\n\nLocal people rely on lions to generate tourism income, and in return big cats feed on old cattle abandoned by local herders, wrote Yadvendradev Vikramsinh Jhala, the former dean of Wildlife Institute of India, in an academic paper published last year.\n\nJhala and his co-authors said the lions also prey on pigs and nilgais \u2013 a type of antelope - which helps eliminate animals the local farmers consider to be pests.\n\nThe community has learned to live with lions because their economic benefits outweigh the risks, said Jhala.\n\n\u201cSuch a level of coexistence between people and a large carnivore is not seen anywhere in the world,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nThe tie with the local people runs deep.\n\n\u201cIf there are Maldharis, there are lions. We are one,\u201d said Lakshman, a 32-year-old farmer from the local Maldhari community.\n\nBut Lakshman, who farms buffaloes and sells their milk to support his five children and wife, said he had noticed an uptick in lion attacks on cattle, which experts say have deepened grievances within the pastoral community.\n\nConservationists warn the dynamic between lions and humans could soon change if more is not done to address the lions\u2019 growing population.\n\nChellam is among a group of conservationists who have been urging the government to move some of the lions to Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary, in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. A survey he and other scientists completed three decades ago found it to be a suitable habitat for lion conservation.\n\nThe call was at the heart of a court battle jointly filed by the Centre for Environment Law and the World Wide Fund for Nature India against the government in 1994 to force local officials in Gujarat to act. In 2013, the Supreme Court of India ruled in favor of the environmental groups, directing the Ministry of Environment to take \u201curgent steps for the re-introduction of Asiatic Lions from Gir Forests to Kuno.\u201d It was to be initiated within six months, starting with the formation of an expert committee.\n\nChellam, who\u2019s on the committee, said the last meeting was held in 2016. He says by not convening regular meetings, the government is dragging its feet on the Supreme Court order.\n\nMore than a decade after the ruling, the lions remain solely in Gujarat. Further complicating the process is the arrival of cheetahs imported from South Africa and Namibia to the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary.\n\nThe first cheetahs arrived in India in 2022 under a historic plan to revive the species 70 years after their extinction in the country. Some cubs died soon after, but 31 are now living in Kuno, indicating \u201csuccessful population growth,\u201d according to a paper published in May that countered criticism of the program.\n\nThe cheetah program is part of the Indian government\u2019s push to transform the country into a global leader in feline conservation. In 2023, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the International Big Cat Alliance to save seven big cats \u2013 tigers, lions, leopards, snow leopards, cheetahs, jaguars and pumas \u2013 which now has 11 member countries.\n\nChellam said the cheetahs\u2019 presence in Kuno would further delay the lion translocation \u2013 if it\u2019s still the plan \u2013 by up to 20 years \u2013 the time it takes for the cheetah population to settle before another species can be brought in.\n\nGujarat\u2019s Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Jaipal Singh declined CNN\u2019s request to comment on the latest developments.\n\nResistance to the translocation also comes from local authorities and people in the tourism industry, who are wary of losing business and the state\u2019s exclusivity as the only place in India to see lions in the wild, Chellam explained.\n\nEfforts to keep lions in Gujarat\n\nThe Gujarat government has come up with an alternative to the Kuno translocation.\n\nIt\u2019s proposing to move some lions to the Barda Wildlife Sanctuary within state borders, noting that 17 Asiatic lions had been sighted there for the first time since 1879.\n\nIt\u2019s also increased funding for lion protection by over 70% in the last three years to $18.2 million in 2023-2024 \u2013 a sign of its commitment to protecting the species.\n\nBut Chellam says Barda is too small and short on prey to sustain a viable lion population.\n\nIt\u2019s also too close to Gir National Park to prevent the spread of disease, meaning a catastrophic pandemic could wipe out Gujarat\u2019s entire population of Asiatic lions.\n\n\u201cHaving all your eggs in one basket is very risky. If there is a disease outbreak, then there is trouble for you,\u201d he said.\n\nPulsing\u2019s father, Ajnera, used to think that humans could co-exist with lions. He moved to the Amreli district, known for lion sightings, seven years ago as a farm laborer.\n\nHis home was 200 meters away from the forest, and it never occurred to him that lions would attack humans. \u201cThis generally does not happen here,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, the grieving father has changed his mind. \u201cWe could not live there anymore. We left the area and moved to another village 5 kilometers (3 miles) away \u2013 out of fear,\u201d he said.",

      "text": "- 1National Tiger Conservation Authority, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, New Delhi, India\n- 2National Zoological Park, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, New Delhi, Delhi, India\n- 3Project Tiger, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, New Delhi, India\nIndia\u2019s Project Cheetah, initiated in 2022, represents a holistic wildlife conservation initiative aimed at restoring cheetah populations, reviving grassland ecosystems, and fostering socio-economic benefits in the region. Despite its strong ecological foundation and adherence to IUCN protocols, the project has faced persistent criticism, often rooted in ideological biases, oversimplified extrapolations, and sensationalized narratives. Critics have misrepresented key aspects, such as the use of soft-release bomas, ethical concerns, and veterinary interventions, while ignoring the project\u2019s adaptive management strategies and measurable progress, including its current status. This perspective piece counters misinformation with factual evidence, highlights the project\u2019s scientific and conservation merits, and underscores India\u2019s commitment to harmonizing ecological restoration with developmental progress.\nIntroduction\nIn the Anthropocene epoch, marked by profound environmental transformations and accelerating biodiversity loss, global conservation initiatives are gaining critical momentum (Johnson et al., 2017; Mosoh et al., 2024). Among these, carnivore conservation has emerged as a priority due to its cascading ecological impacts, offering a mechanism to counteract environmental degradation driven by human activities (Ripple et al., 2014; Bergstrom, 2017; Ingeman et al., 2022). Despite being world\u2019s most densely populated and a rapidly developing nations, India has achieved remarkable success in large carnivore conservation, setting a global benchmark. For instance, India now harbors over 70% of the global wild tiger (Panthera tigris) population, a landmark accomplishment resulting from the collaborative efforts of Indian scientists, ecologists, government agencies, and diverse stakeholders (Qureshi et al., 2023; Jhala et al., 2025). India\u2019s commitment to carnivore conservation is further exemplified by the reintroduction of tigers into historically extirpated landscapes in the country, such as Sariska in Rajasthan and Panna in Madhya Pradesh (Sankar et al., 2013; Dutta and Krishnamurthy, 2024). Such efforts have led to measurable population recoveries, underscoring the effectiveness of India\u2019s adaptive management strategies and long-term conservation planning (Dutta and Krishnamurthy, 2024). These achievements have not only strengthened in-situ conservation but also contributed significantly to global scientific understanding of species recovery, population management, and ecosystem restoration (Jhala et al., 2021a; Batool et al., 2025). While multiple stakeholders have played pivotal roles, these initiatives have been predominantly led and sustained by the government sector, reflecting a robust institutional framework and long-term commitment to biodiversity conservation.\nBuilding on this legacy, India has embarked on another transformative initiative: the introduction of the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), the only large carnivore extirpated in India post-independence due to overhunting and habitat destruction (Chavda and Kazmi, 2019). Declared locally extinct in 1952, the cheetah\u2019s introduction represents more than a conventional predator restoration program. It is a holistic ecological initiative aimed at reviving cheetah populations while safeguarding prey species and protecting other endangered fauna within grassland and open forest ecosystems in the country (Jhala et al., 2021b). Furthermore, this project holds significant socio-economic potential, promising to enhance local economies through ecotourism and sustainable livelihood opportunities, thereby reinforcing India\u2019s legacy of harmonizing ecological restoration with developmental activities.\nIn recent years, there has been a noticeable trend where government-led initiatives often face heightened scrutiny. Since its inception in 2022, Project Cheetah has also faced persistent criticism, often rooted in ideological biases, preconceived notions, oversimplified extrapolations, and sensationalized media narratives (Chellam, 2022; Gopalaswamy et al., 2022; Wachter et al., 2023; Down To Earth, 2024; Joshi et al., 2025). While constructive criticism is essential for refining conservation strategies and ensuring accountability, much of the discourse around Project Cheetah has been characterized by self-referential arguments, selective use of literature, and a disproportionate emphasis on negative outcomes (Chellam, 2023; Civil Society News, 2024; Down To Earth, 2024; Joshi et al., 2025). Some criticisms have focused on emotional appeals, which, while understandable, are not balanced with scientific evidence. At times, such critiques have relied on incomplete, exaggerated, or misleading information, shaping narratives that may unduly influence public perception. While raising awareness of concerns is important, an overreliance on sensationalism or unsubstantiated claims risks prioritizing rhetorical impact over factual accuracy.\nWhile the unfounded negative narratives surrounding Project Cheetah are unlikely to diminish the Government of India\u2019s steadfast commitment to the initiative, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), as the lead implementing agency, recognizes the critical importance of transparency and public accountability. Efforts to disseminate information regarding the project, including mortality details, cheetah movements, prey abundance and research efforts are regularly being carried out in the form of annual reports in NTCA\u2019s official website (https://ntca.gov.in/reports/#reports2) and through formal press briefings (National Tiger Conservation Authority et al., 2023; Qureshi et al., 2024a; National Tiger Conservation Authority, 2025; Press Trust of India, 2024a, b). However, it is imperative to further counter misinformation and promote evidence-based discourse by publicizing factual data and providing an accurate assessment of the project\u2019s current status. This is essential not only for rectifying misconceptions but also for advancing the broader objectives of conservation science and practice.\nScientific merit of Project Cheetah\nThe decision to introduce cheetahs in India was not made impulsively. A consultative meeting involving global species experts, IUCN office bearers, non-governmental organizations, renowned academic experts, and officials from the Government of India was held in September 2009. The plans to reintroduce cheetahs were advanced only after a consensus was reached during this meeting (Ranjitsinh and Jhala, 2010; Jhala et al., 2021b). Further to this, the project underwent rigorous assessments, including site evaluations by national and international experts (Ranjitsinh and Jhala, 2010; Jhala et al., 2011, 2021; Marker, 2011, 2020). Prior to the translocation, government officials and conservation managers from Namibia and South Africa also conducted on-site inspections to access the preparedness (National Tiger Conservation Authority et al., 2023). The project adhered to IUCN guidelines for species reintroductions and conservation translocations (IUCN/SSC, 2013; World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) & International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 2014; Jhala et al., 2021b; Tordiffe et al., 2021), ensuring a science-based approach.\nThe initiative was also welcomed by the IUCN Cat Specialist Group and the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS) Scientific Council at its fifth Sessional Committee meeting (ScC-SC5) in 2021 (CMS Scientific Council, 2021). While Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii (northeast African cheetah) was recommended by the committee for introduction in India (CMS Scientific Council, 2021), the selection of A. j. jubatus (southern African cheetah) as the founder population was ultimately determined by three key conservation criteria: (1) documented metapopulation growth of the sub species, evidenced by a three-fold increase in wild numbers since 1965 (van der Marve et al., 2016); (2) availability of genetically suitable surplus individuals; and (3) demonstrated adaptive capacity to diverse ecological conditions. This decision aligned with established reintroduction biology principles, acknowledging that such programs necessitate frequent supplementation and it was thus important to source founders from a growing cheetah metapopulation framework that could supply sufficient founder cheetahs (Buk et al., 2018). The southern African metapopulation\u2019s proven success in these parameters justified its selection following comprehensive ecological and logistical assessments.\nAlthough project\u2019s scientific framework has been robust from conception through implementation, critiques of Project Cheetah have often raised concerns about its perceived lack of conservation and scientific merit, particularly regarding the ecological criteria guiding the project (Gopalaswamy et al., 2022; Wachter et al., 2023). While a comprehensive rebuttal is beyond this perspective piece\u2019s scope, these criticisms have already been rigorously addressed by the scientific community involved with the project (Tordiffe et al., 2023; Cristescu et al., 2024). Overall, these disagreements largely stem from extrapolating cheetah home ranges and space-use patterns from certain African habitats and applying predictive models to the Indian context. However, such extrapolations lack scientific rigor, as the ecology of any species, including cheetahs, is mediated by a multitude of factors (Weise et al., 2017; Cristescu et al., 2024).\nFor example, in Serengeti National Park, female cheetahs that track the migratory Thomson\u2019s gazelles occupy vast home ranges averaging 833 km\u00b2, far exceeding the 37 km\u00b2 typical of resident males in the same landscape (Durant et al., 1988; Caro, 1994). In contrast, Kruger National Park and Phinda Resource Reserve, where prey is sedentary, cheetahs are observed to have smaller, overlapping ranges: males occupy 126 to 195 km\u00b2, while females range across 150 to 171 km\u00b2 (Hunter, 1998; Broomhall et al., 2003). Cheetah spatial dynamics are further influenced by competition with dominant predators, such as lions and leopards. Additionally, contrary to the assumption that cheetahs are savanna specialists, several studies reveal their adaptability to diverse habitats and prey types (Bissett and Bernard, 2007; Weise et al., 2017). Research has also demonstrated that cheetahs can thrive in thicket vegetation and are not restricted to small or medium-sized prey (Bissett and Bernard, 2007; Mills et al., 2004).\nWhile it is premature to define ecology, home ranges and space-use patterns for cheetahs in India, initial findings suggest ecological adaptability. Preliminary observations from free-ranging cheetahs in Kuno National Park reveal predation on a broad prey spectrum, including Indian hare (Lepus nigricollis), chital (Axis axis), sambar (Rusa unicolor), four-horned antelope (Tetracerus quadricornis), chinkara (Gazella bennettii), blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra), and nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus), with an average observed kill interval of 6.68 days \u00b1 0.98 SE (National Tiger Conservation Authority et al., 2023). Radio-collar data indicate that cheetahs utilize and hunt across varied habitats, including savanna grasslands, mixed deciduous forests, and riverine patches (National Tiger Conservation Authority et al., 2023; Qureshi et al., 2024a). Notably, despite Kuno National Park harboring very high leopard densities, free-ranging cheetahs have not only endured but successfully segregated themselves spatio-temporally from these potential competitors. In-depth details on all these findings are publicly available and may be accessed for further reference (see data availability statement). Conservation translocations of this scale require extended timeframes to assess long-term viability, and further monitoring will clarify habitat preferences, movement ecology and behavioral attributes.\nPrevious experiences across Southern Africa also demonstrate that the success of cheetah introduction depends significantly on the introduction environment and individual cheetah behavior contexts (Walker et al., 2022; Dimbleby et al., 2024). Such findings highlight the limitations of applying spatial ecology studies from one region to another without considering local ecological dynamics and behavioral contexts (Cristescu et al., 2024). A more nuanced understanding of cheetah ecology, grounded in local context and supported by empirical data, is thus essential to evaluate the scientific and conservation merits of the project. Given that the project is still in its nascent stages, it is too early to draw definitive conclusions.\nMisplaced concerns about cheetahs in captivity\nA recurring criticism of Project Cheetah has involved the frequent misapplication of the term \u201ccaptive\u201d in reference to the introduced cheetahs at Kuno National Park (Chellam, 2024a; Mudur, 2024; Nitnaware, 2024a; Ray, 2024; Joshi et al., 2025). The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums defines captivity as the confinement of animals in man-made enclosures with reliance on human care (Mellor et al., 2015). In contrast, the cheetahs in Kuno are neither held in artificial structures nor dependent on human provisioning. Instead, they were initially held in soft-release bomas (SRBs) with access to an adequate locally available prey base (Qureshi et al., 2024a). These SRBs are fenced natural habitats within the larger Kuno landscape, allowing the cheetahs to hunt independently and exhibit natural behaviors while acclimatizing to their new environment (Figure 1A). This soft-release model is not only an internationally recognized best practice for carnivore reintroductions but has also been shown to increase the odds of reintroduction success by 2.5-fold (Thomas et al., 2023).\nFigure 1.

Additionally, we would like to add one more image D (D) Free-ranging female cheetah (Namibian origin) and cubs at a waterhole in Kuno National Park.\nAnother point of contention is the duration cheetahs have spent in SRBs (Chellam, 2024b; Nitnaware, 2024a; Down To Earth, 2024; Ray, 2024; Joshi et al., 2025; Wildlife Animal Protection Forum of South Africa, 2025). It is essential to clarify that Project Cheetah does not follow a simplistic catch-transport-release approach. Instead, it employs adaptive management strategies designed to maximize the chances of the founder population successfully establishing itself. Kuno\u2019s management team had initiated the phased release of cheetahs in May\u2013June 2023 (National Tiger Conservation Authority et al., 2023). However, unforeseen challenges, including an unseasonal winter coat, tick infestations, and associated infections, resulted in multiple mortalities in free ranging settings. This prompted the temporary recapture and return of the cheetahs to SRBs for close monitoring and medical intervention (National Tiger Conservation Authority et al., 2023). Importantly, these setbacks informed critical management adaptations, such as the implementation of topical long-acting ectoparasiticidal treatments, which effectively prevented further mortality during subsequent summer and humid seasons (Muliya et al., 2024a). Having addressed these issues, and the cheetahs now being well adapted to the introduction landscape, the phased release process resumed in early 2024, with six introduced cheetahs currently thriving independently in Kuno\u2019s unfenced wilderness (Yadav, 2025). Meanwhile, other cheetahs await their release in a similarly phased manner.\nA recent document circulating among South African animal welfare groups, which has no connection to Project Cheetah, falsely claims that all individuals under the project remain in \u201ccaptivity\u201d (The Wildlife Animal Protection Forum, 2025). This assertion is factually incorrect, lacks empirical foundation and clearly ignores publicly available evidence demonstrating the current status of translocated cheetahs in Kuno. By the time the above document was released, twelve cheetahs (5 introduced & 7 Indian born cubs over a year old) were already in free-ranging conditions (Press Trust of India, 2024c; The Hindu Bureau, 2025). Given the demonstrable inaccuracies, this narrative should be reassessed to align with established facts. In order to clarify the current status, the precise demographic and spatial information of cheetahs under the project are presented in Table 1.\nCritics have also inaccurately portrayed cheetah births in Kuno as \u201ccaptive breeding,\u201d a grossly misleading characterization (Chellam, 2024a; Nitnaware, 2024b; Ray, 2024). Cheetahs cannot be forced to breed, even in controlled environments, a fact highlighted by the more than four decades required for western zoos to develop successful breeding programs (McDermott, 2019; Crosier et al., 2022). The fact that translocated cheetahs in Kuno have produced 25 cubs from six successful litters in 2.5 years (Yadav, 2025), with the first breeding occurring within a year of reintroduction (Qureshi et al., 2024a), demonstrates that these animals are in a stress-free, near-natural environment, not captivity (Figure 1B). Unlike traditional captive breeding programs, the cubs born in Kuno are nurtured and raised entirely by their mothers without any form of human intervention. A comprehensive Standard Operating Procedure has also been established to ensure systematic management of reproducing females and their cubs at India\u2019s introduction sites (Muliya et al., 2024b). This mandatory framework implements strict management protocols during critical reproductive phases, with enforceable safeguards to prevent captivity while ensuring animal welfare and health.\nAdditionally, eleven Indian-born cubs, currently transitioning to adolescence, have already been released into the wilderness alongside their mother (Yadav, 2025). This strategic \u201cHeadstarting\u201d approach aims to provide the cubs with an increased survival chance, optimal opportunity to grow into adolescence, disperse naturally post release, and contribute to the project\u2019s long-term success (Figure 1C). Contrary to critics\u2019 claims, this also serves as a testament that the project neither artificially breeds females nor keeps them confined in perpetuity but instead focuses on creating better survival opportunities for the first generation of Indian-born cubs, ensuring their successful integration into the wild.\nMisinformed ethical and justice concerns\nOne of the most recent critiques of Project Cheetah centers on perceived injustices inflicted on local communities and translocated animals (Joshi et al., 2025). This perspective piece exhibits a clear bias, selectively using sources to advance a negative narrative while omitting and misrepresenting key facts. To clarify, there has been no unjustified displacement or coerced relocation of local communities due to Project Cheetah. The majority of relocations within the current cheetah introduction site occurred long before the project\u2019s conceptualization (Kabra, 2003; Jhala et al., 2021b). Since project\u2019s inception in 2023, only one village has been relocated, and this resettlement too was conducted in full compliance with existing legal frameworks in India. The process was guided by recommendations and ratified by the affected \u201cGram Sabha\u201d, a community-based village-level assembly where every villager has the right to participate and deliberate on development issues impacting their community (Ministry of Tribal Affairs, 2006).\nIn India, resettlement in protected areas is strictly voluntary and governed by stringent legal provisions, including the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (Ministry of Tribal Affairs, 2006). Importantly, villagers retain the right to remain within protected areas if they choose to do so, as forcible eviction is explicitly prohibited by law (Ministry of Tribal Affairs, 2006). Contrary to critics\u2019 assertions, the resettlement process does not rely on offering \u201cone-off compensation\u201d as an incentive. Instead, it provides comprehensive support, including agricultural land, monetary assistance for housing, small-scale investments, and access to communal facilities such as education, healthcare, and irrigation, and hand holding efforts for 5 years, all funded by the government (National Tiger Conservation Authority, 2010). This holistic approach offers marginalized communities improved opportunities for socio-economic integration, contrasting sharply with the restricted and isolated lifestyles they often experience within protected areas, a fact that critics have conveniently mislaid.\nWhile the recovery of large carnivore populations can introduce new trade-offs, the socio-ecological benefits of their conservation frequently outweigh the associated costs (Gregr et al., 2020; Ingeman et al., 2022). In the context of Project Cheetah, hundreds of local youths have been directly employed as forest watchers or cheetah trackers, while skill development programs have trained others as guides and drivers for eco-tourism initiatives (National Tiger Conservation Authority et al., 2023; The Corbett Foundation, 2024). Additionally, improved infrastructure and enhanced connectivity have facilitated better access to healthcare, education, and commercial opportunities, thereby aligning conservation goals with socio-economic development and community well-being in the region. Despite referencing publicly available documents that detail these facts elsewhere in their perspective article (National Tiger Conservation Authority et al., 2023; Qureshi et al., 2024a), critics\u2019 deliberate omission and selective disregard for critical information to advance an \u201cinjustice\u201d narrative significantly undermine the integrity of their critique.\nWhile the concerns raised by critics regarding animal ethics and welfare are appreciable, their adoption of a narrow or extensionist perspective is problematic and unjustifiable within the context of wildlife conservation and species reintroduction efforts (Paterson, 2006; Thulin and R\u00f6cklinsberg, 2020). Such approaches often prioritize the welfare of individual animals from introduced species over broader ecological considerations, including the native wildlife and the restoration of ecosystem functions that benefit from reintroduction initiatives (Paterson, 2006). When the objectives of introduction programs, such as Project Cheetah, are examined through a holistic lens; aimed at restoring, preserving, and saving a species, or enhancing ecosystem function and resilience (Jhala et al., 2021b), the suffering of specific individuals may be regarded as an acceptable, albeit regrettable, cost (Thulin and R\u00f6cklinsberg, 2020). This is not to condone or justify suffering at the individual level but to acknowledge it as a potential trade-off in pursuit of the greater good, whether for the survival of a species, the health of an ecosystem, or the preservation of overall biodiversity (Thulin and R\u00f6cklinsberg, 2020). Critics also overlook the fact that the South African cheetah population itself is the product of highly managed reintroduction efforts (Buk et al., 2018; Sievert et al., 2020). For instance, cheetahs were reportedly extirpated from the KwaZulu-Natal province by the 1930s but were successfully reintroduced from Namibia to several reserves in the province during the 1960s and 1970s (Marnewick et al., 2007). This historical precedent underscores the potential benefits of well-planned reintroduction programs, which can contribute significantly to species recovery and ecosystem restoration. By focusing narrowly on individual welfare without considering the broader ecological and conservation goals, critics risk undermining efforts that have demonstrated long-term benefits for biodiversity and ecosystem health.\nTo advance their narrative regarding species wellbeing, critics have often employed selective comparisons, such as contrasting the survival rates of adult cheetahs in Kuno with the 85% average survival rate observed in South Africa\u2019s metapopulation (Joshi et al., 2025). This comparison, however, represents a blatant misrepresentation of the data. Existing literature clearly demonstrates that annual survival rates for translocated cheetahs vary significantly across global contexts, ranging from 0% to 85%, depending on factors such as geography, habitat conditions, and management strategies (Marnewick et al., 2009; Houser et al., 2011; Weise et al., 2015; Boast et al., 2018; Schroeder, 2019). A similar approach has been adopted by certain media outlets, who emphasize individual cheetah mortalities while failing to consider broader population dynamics (Nitnaware, 2024c; The Wildlife Animal Protection Forum, 2025). Though direct comparisons are complicated by differing management strategies, Table 2 provides survival rates from key southern African translocation initiatives for reference.\nIt is important to recognize that some level of mortality is an inherent aspect of conservation translocation, introduction, and reintroduction efforts, and should not be interpreted as an indicator of project\u2019s failure. This principle is well-documented by the IUCN in the context of conservation translocations (Soorae, 2021) and was explicitly factored into the Action Plan for Cheetah Reintroduction in India (Jhala et al., 2021b). Notably, the cheetah mortality rate in Kuno has remained well below the anticipated threshold of 50% (Jhala et al., 2021b; Qureshi et al., 2024a). To elaborate, adult cheetah survival rates in Kuno were 70% in the first year (n = 20; mortalities = 6) and reached 85.71% in the second year (n = 14; mortalities = 2) (Muliya et al., 2024a). Over 2.5 years, the overall cub survival rate in Kuno was 66.67% (n = 21; mortalities = 7), a significant figure, given that the species is known to experience very high cub mortality before eight weeks of age (Laurenson, 1994). Despite initial mortalities, Kuno currently sustains a population of 31 cheetahs as of May, 2025, indicating successful population growth at the reintroduction site (Yadav, 2025).\nMisconceptions about veterinary capabilities and field interventions\nAnother frequently discussed topic pertains to the veterinary capabilities at Kuno, including the frequency of management interventions being carried out. It is critical to emphasize that reintroduction is not merely a numbers game but a scientifically complex process. Decisions regarding veterinary interventions are made exclusively by trained on-field wildlife veterinarians based on situational assessments, and uninformed commentary by non-veterinary experts lacks scientific validity. Comprehensive veterinary preparations for the project had in fact begun well before the actual introduction. A detailed Disease Risk Analysis (DRA) was conducted in accordance with IUCN guidelines by a team of veterinary and cheetah experts prior to the animals\u2019 arrival (Tordiffe et al., 2021). The fact that not a single animal has been lost to the risks identified in the DRA thus far underscores the robustness of the project\u2019s veterinary preparedness and planning.\nThe project is further supported by a team of three on-field veterinarians from various central and state agencies, ensuring a high standard of cheetah health management (National Tiger Conversation Authority et al., 2023; Qureshi et al., 2024a). Despite Kuno\u2019s remote and logistically challenging location, a state-of-the-art veterinary hospital equipped with advanced facilities has been established, enabling the delivery of comprehensive veterinary care (Qureshi et al., 2024a). This infrastructure reflects the project\u2019s commitment to safeguarding the health and welfare of the reintroduced cheetahs, while also benefiting the conservation medicine initiatives in native fauna.\nCritics often highlight that cheetahs are susceptible to stress, particularly during the capture of free-ranging animals (Joshi et al., 2025). However, they conveniently overlook the fact that the same study they reference (Braud et al., 2019) reported a 20% mortality rate for immobilized cheetahs in South Africa over a 15-year period. In stark contrast, Project Cheetah in India has recorded zero immobilization-related fatalities, a testament to the care, expertise, and precision of the project\u2019s veterinary and management teams. Furthermore, critics frequently cite \u201c90 immobilizations\u201d as a point of contention without defining what constitutes an \u201cacceptable number of immobilizations\u201d or providing any scientific basis for their critique. These 90 immobilizations over 20 cheetahs in 2.5 years equate to approximately 2 immobilizations per cheetah per year, a reasonable figure given the range of necessary management interventions, including treatment, prophylaxis, radio-collar deployment, and other critical procedures. Those with practical on-field experience in wildlife management understand that, unlike domestic animals, which can often be handled with minimal restraint, field immobilization in wildlife is a clinically driven decision aimed at ensuring both animal welfare and human safety (Fahlman, 2008; Muliya et al., 2016; Walker et al., 2022). The selective omission of contextual details and the use of partial data to support a predetermined narrative are not only misleading but also scientifically irresponsible. Such approaches risk compromising constructive discourse on conservation efforts, as they fail to acknowledge the complexities inherent in reintroduction programs or the expertise of professionals dedicated to ensuring the health and welfare of introduced animals.\nIn conclusion, long-term conservation initiatives, including species reintroductions and habitat restoration, require meticulous planning, scientific rigor, and sustained multi-stakeholder collaboration. While cheetah reintroduction is inherently a gradual and risky process, with inevitable challenges and adaptive learning, Project Cheetah has demonstrated significant progress within just 2.5 years, indicating a promising trajectory. To bolster genetic diversity among the founder population, the Government of India is already negotiating with the Governments of Republics of Namibia, South Africa, and Botswana for additional cheetah translocations. Concurrently, a landscape-scale expansion strategy is being implemented, incorporating neighboring protected areas beyond Kuno National Park\u2019s core zone (Qureshi et al., 2024b). Additionally, secondary reintroduction sites, including Banni Grasslands in Gujarat and Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh, are being prepared for cheetah introductions in near future. These efforts incorporate ecological lessons from Kuno, with targeted prey restoration, including translocation of conflict-prone herbivores from human-dominated landscapes, so as to ensure sustainable cheetah prey availability. As the nodal agency, the National Tiger Conservation Authority remains firmly committed to this visionary initiative, ensuring that the majestic cheetah reclaims its ancestral landscapes. This initiative exemplifies India\u2019s enduring legacy of harmonizing ecological restoration with developmental progress, setting a global benchmark for conservation stewardship.\nData availability statement\nPublicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.

      "text": "After going extinct in India over 70 years ago, cheetahs are finally making a comeback in the country with a new reintroduction program.\nEight cheetahs from Namibia arrived in India on Saturday, according to a tweet from the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF). The big cats were released into India\u2019s Kuno National Park in the state of Madya Pradesh.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi \u2013 who was celebrating his 72nd birthday \u2013 was there to welcome the cheetahs to their new home. \u201cA long wait is over,\u201d Modi wrote on Twitter alongside pictures of the cats in their new environment.\nCheetahs were declared extinct in India in 1952 and are the only large carnivore in the country to have suffered that fate.\nToday, the spotted felines are found in southern and eastern Africa, particularly in Namibia, Botswana, Kenya, and Tanzania, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).\nBut the endangered cats used to have a much larger range. Historically, cheetahs roamed throughout the Middle East and central India as well as most of sub-Saharan Africa. Habitat loss, poaching, and conflict with humans have greatly reduced their populations.\nThere are now less than 7,000 cheetahs left in the wild, says the WWF. In Iran, there are just 12 adult cheetahs in the wild.\nThe release of the eight animals is part of a larger plan to reintroduce the cats to their former range. In January, India\u2019s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change announced in a news release that the government planned to release 50 cheetahs into Indian national parks over the next five years.\nThe group that arrived in Kuno consists of three male and five female adult cheetahs from Namibia, according to a news release from the CCF. Each cheetah was vaccinated, fitted with a satellite collar and kept in isolation at the fund\u2019s location in Otjiwarongo, Namibia, according to the release.\nThe animals chosen for the 11-hour trek were selected \u201cbased on an assessment of health, wild disposition, hunting skills, and ability to contribute genetics that will result in a strong founder population,\u201d says the organization.\nIt took a multi-step journey to get the cats from Namibia, on Africa\u2019s southwestern coast, to central India. On Friday, the cheetahs traveled from the CCF\u2019s center to the Hosea Kutako International Airport in Windhoek, Namibia. Then, they took a private jet to Jaipur, India. Finally, on Saturday the cats were taken to Kuno National Park and released into their new home.\n\u201cAs a conservationist, I am thrilled, and as CCF\u2019s leader, I am exceptionally proud of the work of our CCF reintroduction team,\u201d Laurie Marker, the founder and executive director of the CCF, said in the release. \u201cWithout research and dedication to cheetah conservation, this project could not take place.\u201d\nJhala Yadvendradev, dean of the Wildlife Institute of India and principal scientist for India\u2019s Project Cheetah, said that the project will benefit India\u2019s ecoystems at large \u2013 not just cheetahs.\n\u201cBringing back a top predator restores historic evolutionary balance, resulting in cascading effects, leading to better management and restoration of wildlife habitat, for the benefit of all species, and will uplift the livelihoods of poor forest dwelling communities,\u201d Yadvendradev said in the release.\nA previous attempt to bring African cheetahs to Kuno National Park in 2012 was halted by India\u2019s Supreme Court, which suggested that introducing a non-native species was problematic and warned the there might not be enough prey in the park to keep them fed.\nSP Yadav, Director General of Project Cheetah, said India has worked to prepare the park over several years, through anti-poaching measures and boosting the amount of prey.\nHowever, Faiyaz Khudsar, a conservation biologist who worked at the Kuno National Park for around eight years, is concerned the cheetahs may still not have enough to eat.\n\u201cIf naturally you build up the population of the prey base and then you bring in a new species or predator, it\u2019s sustainable. (But if you bring in a) prey base from somewhere else \u2026 I don\u2019t know which direction it will go after six months or a year,\u201d Khudsar told CNN.\nKhudsar also said the cheetahs would have competition from aggressive other predators like leopards.\nBut Adrien Tordiff, associate professor at the University of Pretoria, who has been involved with Project Cheetah since 2020, said the cheetahs from South Africa had been selected with the National Park\u2019s other creatures in mind.\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re going into areas where there\u2019s quite a high leopard density, we wanted animals that are really quite wild and very used to being with other large carnivores, lions, leopards and so on. So they\u2019re not na\u00efve of those carnivores, and they can avoid them, they can defend themselves against them, they\u2019re really aware of what they are and the risks that they pose to them,\u201d Tordiff told CNN.\nIndia\u2019s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change believes that bringing cheetahs back to India \u201cwill likely result in better conservation of open forest, grassland, and scrub ecosystems for which they will serve as a flagship species.\u201d\nThe Indian government believes the factors that led to the cheetah\u2019s extinction within the country \u2013 primarily hunting and habitat loss \u2013 have \u201cabated.\u201d\nUnder the British Raj, forests were cleared to develop settlements and set up plantations, resulting in the loss of habitat for big cats, such as the cheetah. Considered less dangerous than tigers and relatively easy to tame, cheetahs were also frequently used by Indian nobility for sport-hunting.\nAccording to Jhala, the last cheetahs were shot in 1947, shortly before they were officially declared extinct."
