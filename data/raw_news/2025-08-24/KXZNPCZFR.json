  "content": "Back to the opposition benches, the new Grey MP, Tom Venning, says again that the government is copying the opposition\u2019s housing policy. He says the opposition welcomes the vote in confidence of Coalition policy, but asks whether the PM will admit that Labor\u2019s policies aren\u2019t working.\n\nBefore Albanese can answer, we have our first booting of QT!\n\nTim Watts, a Melbourne backbencher gets thrown out of the chamber. Watts chuckles, and Dick says: \u201cYou might be laughing, but it\u2019s not funny.\u201d\n\nAlbanese argues again that the Coalition seems split on the issue because Andrew Bragg, the shadow housing minister, has called Labor\u2019s announcements \u201ccrazy ideas\u201d.\n\nThe member suggests that maybe his shadow housing minister was wrong or this was ambiguous, but it doesn\u2019t sound ambiguous to me as a result of our announcement. Andrew Bragg said \u2018we will work to try and stop these crazy ideas coming in to existence\u2019 \u2013 that was actually his response.\n\nBragg has criticised the 5% deposit scheme for being not being income capped, and has said it means the children of billionaires will have access to the scheme.",

      "text": "Australia politics live: Albanese says opposition \u2018flippant\u2019 to ask if Palestine position will affect US relationship; Senate debate begins with \u2018mean girls\u2019 scuffle\nPM to seek meeting with Trump as \u2018summit season\u2019 approaches\nAnthony Albanese and Clare O\u2019Neil have taken a venture out to the Canberra \u2018burbs this morning, to spruik the 5% deposit scheme.\nBut the question on everybody\u2019s lips (and by everybody I mean journalists, the parliament and people interested in international affairs) is when Anthony Albanese is going to meet face-to-face with Donald Trump.\nThe Coalition has been critical of Albanese for not having secured a meeting \u2013 particularly when the Aukus pact and tariffs are on the line.\nAlbanese tells the press conference that summit season is coming, and there will be opportunities for a sit-down.\n[There are] a number of events over the coming months, we\u2019re about to enter summit season, and I look forward to discussions continuing face to face, as they have been constructive when I\u2019ve had discussions with President Trump up to now.\nBragg says Labor underwriting 'extremely wealthy' with first home buyer scheme\nThe Coalition isn\u2019t a fan of the government\u2019s 5% deposit scheme, and Andrew Bragg, the opposition housing spokesperson, says it\u2019s going to turn the government into a major property developer.\nSpeaking to RN Breakfast, Bragg says the scheme shouldn\u2019t be a free-for-all:\nThis is an uncapped scheme which is available to billionaires or the children of billionaires if they want to use a government program. I think we\u2019re getting to a point where Australia is becoming a ridiculous nation where the taxpayer is underwriting mortgage insurance schemes for extremely wealthy people.\nOn pausing changes to the construction code, and streamlining environmental approvals for housing, Bragg says both were Coalition policies.\nHe says the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act has been \u201cvery anti housing development\u201d\nJust because a bird flew over a housing lot in 1971 shouldn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have houses built today. And that\u2019s frankly what\u2019s happening now.\nPacific nations will \u2018make their own decisions\u2019 on recognising Palestinian statehood, PM says\nAlbanese says the government will continue pushing for a two-state solution, as Israel pushes ahead with its military campaign in Gaza.\nSara asks whether there\u2019s more the government can do to help stop the conflict. Albanese says Labor has advocated \u201cdirectly to the Israeli government, but also through our vote in international forums\u201d to get aid into Gaza, advocate for a ceasefire, and get the hostages released.\nBut what about other nations across the Pacific region?\nWe know New Zealand and several other Pacific nations have so far not joined Australia and other nations including France and the UK in recognising Palestinian statehood.\nAlbanese won\u2019t bite when asked whether Australia has raised Palestinian recognition to those other nations.\nThey\u2019re sovereign states, and I welcome their sovereignty \u2026 and they\u2019ll make their own decisions. Australia will make our decisions without concern for anything other than our national interest and for doing the right thing.\nIsrael\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Sharren Haskel, who has been a vocal critic of Australia, will soon be visiting the Pacific region \u2013 which you can read more about here:\nRoundtable about \u2018future issues\u2019 while government focused on delivering election promises, Albanese says\nMoving on to the productivity roundtable from last week, the question goes to how much appetite Labor has for reform that it didn\u2019t take to the last election.\nIt\u2019s a big question in the political sphere at the moment \u2013 whether a party\u2019s mandate is just for what it promises at an election, or goes much further.\nLabor has seemed pretty unwilling to introduce tax policy above the changes to superannuation tax concessions. Albanese says:\nWell, the economic roundtable wasn\u2019t about just this year or this term, it was about future issues, enabling them to be raised in a way that wasn\u2019t playing the old rule-in, rule-out game. What we are focused on, in the immediate sense, is the reforms that we took to the election.\nSara asks the PM about a warning from the Grattan Institute CEO \u2013 who was at the roundtable \u2013 saying Australians will have to expect lower service delivery from the government if taxes aren\u2019t raised. Albanese accuses her of \u201cacademic\u201d speak.\nAcademics talk in the academic world. What I do is live in the real world, and in the real world my government\u2019s focused on delivering for people.\nRN Breakfast\u2019s Sally Sara points out that the Coalition had its own policy to pause the national construction code, which it announced during the election, and which Labor had criticised.\nSo what\u2019s different now?\nAlbanese says Labor\u2019s plan is to pause changes to the code until mid-2029, rather than the Coalition\u2019s plan which would have been a pause for up to 10 years.\nThey had a plan that was for longer, but at the same time, they were slashing support for housing.\nBringing forward expanded first home buyer deposit scheme will make an 'enormous difference', Albanese says\nAnthony Albanese says bringing the 5% deposit expansion forward by three months will make an \u201cenormous\u201d difference.\nTo quickly recap \u2013 the expansion removes the income caps, and means any first home buyer can access the scheme. It also increases the house price cap across the country (because we know how quickly those house price are rising).\nOn ABC\u2019s RN Breakfast, Albanese\u2019s running through the numbers, and the talking points. He says those using the scheme should avoid about $1.5bn in potential mortgage insurance costs over the next year.\nI think this will make an enormous difference, together with the announcements that we\u2019ve made on the weekend of pausing the National Construction Code for four years, more prefabricated housing, and the fast tracking of some 26,000 homes that have been stuck in the approvals process.\nNimby v Yimby debate over Woollahra station development\nIn the leafy suburbs of Woollahra in Sydney\u2019s east (one of the most expensive suburbs in the country) \u2013 the housing debate is in full force.\nThe NSW government is looking at reviving the old unfinished Woollahra train station, which would open up higher density housing around it. Everyone\u2019s weighing in this morning.\nClare O\u2019Neil credits the premier, Chris Minns, for \u201cstepping up\u201d and showing some \u201cmettle\u201d against the nimbys (\u201cnot in my back yard\u201d advocates).\nPoliticians in this country have to show some mettle on this one. This [Woollahra] is 8km from the city, it\u2019s fantastically connected through public transport, it\u2019s a place where lots of young people are going to want to live, and this is going to give them that opportunity.\nAsked whether the community should just \u201csuck it up\u201d, O\u2019Neil says she wouldn\u2019t be quite so rude as to say it in that way, but essentially \u2026 yes they do.\nOver on Sunrise, frontbencher Tanya Plibersek and Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce were tussling on the issue. Plibersek also welcomed the move by the Minns government.\nYou have to make sure that every part of a capital city is contributing to those housing targets. There is no free pass for some suburbs like Woollahra.\nJoyce isn\u2019t quite so enthusiastic, and accuses Plibersek of supporting the apartment constituents with all \u201cthe new shade they\u2019re about to get\u201d.\nRead more on Sydney\u2019s density battle in Daisy DumasandAnne Davies\u2019 story from the weekend:\nPausing national construction code will not mean increase in building defects, housing minister says\nClare O\u2019Neil, the housing minister, is doing the media rounds this morning \u2013 touching down at ABC News Breakfast to promote the 5% deposit scheme.\nBut affordability is also linked to supply \u2013 another issue the government has to deal with.\nThe government has promised to build 1.2m homes over five years to June 2029, a target they\u2019re currently behind on. They\u2019re hoping announcements over the weekend to pause changes to the national construction code \u2013 cutting red tape \u2013 and reducing times for environmental approvals for housing will improve the trajectory. O\u2019Neil said:\nWe committed to roll out 5% deposits to every single first home buyer in the country, we would do that on 1 January, but we can help people faster than that, so we\u2019re bringing it forward to 1 October. This will help tens of thousands of more young people in the market every year.\nAsked whether pausing the code will see an increase in building defects, O\u2019Neil says the government would \u201cnever allow that to happen\u201d.\nWhat we\u2019ve done on the construction code is say safety defects or issues that will cost consumers will be fixed. We\u2019re freezing the code just for non-essential changes. If we find a safety problem in our building approach, we would not hesitate to fix that.\nLabor brings forward 5% deposit scheme for first home buyers to 1 October\nThe 5% deposit scheme, where first home buyers can access a home with a smaller deposit guaranteed by the government, was a Labor election promise.\nCurrently, only a limited number of people are able to access the scheme, which is income tested. From 1 October, it\u2019ll be accessible for all first home buyers \u2013 but only up to certain house price caps (so you can\u2019t bid for a $2m Sydney house under the scheme).\nIn Sydney, that price cap is $1.5m, in Melbourne it\u2019s $950,000 while in Brisbane it\u2019s $1m.\nThe expanded access was due to come into effect on 1 January next year \u2013 but it\u2019s been brought forward slightly.\nThe prime minister, Anthony Albanese will be spruiking it to the media a bit later this morning.\nKrishani Dhanji here with you for the busy sitting week ahead.\nAfter a week of the government\u2019s economic roundtable, I\u2019m sure politicians will be at their most productive today \u2026 but then again, perhaps not.\nFirst up on the agenda in the House of Representatives today will be debating Barnaby Joyce\u2019s bill to end net zero \u2013 which we know won\u2019t get anywhere, but which Labor is using to split the Coalition (you can read a bit more on that here).\nBut in the wake of that roundtable, Labor has made a few housing announcements over the weekend, including a pause to the national construction code, and a start date for the expanded access to 5% deposits for first home buyers from 1 October (more details on that shortly).\nI\u2019ve got a large coffee, I hope you\u2019ve got some caffeine too \u2013 let\u2019s get this ball rolling.\nComments (\u2026)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

  "argos_summary": "The article covers a chaotic Australian parliamentary session where opposition MP Tom Venning accuses the Albanese government of copying its housing policy, while PM Anthony Albanese defends the 5% deposit scheme and a pause to the National Construction Code as measures to boost first\u2011home affordability. Opposition housing spokesperson Andrew Bragg criticises the scheme as uncapped and potentially favouring the wealthy, and the debate touches on broader policy issues such as environmental approvals, net\u2011zero legislation, and international stances on Palestine. Albanese also hints at upcoming summit meetings with Donald Trump and reiterates Australia\u2019s commitment to a two\u2011state solution in Gaza. The piece highlights the ongoing clash between Labor\u2019s housing promises and the Coalition\u2019s critiques, alongside other political and international developments.",
