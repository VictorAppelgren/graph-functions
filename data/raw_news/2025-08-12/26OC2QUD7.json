(AP Photo/Becky Bohrer, File)\n\nA huge basin of rainwater and snowmelt dammed by Alaska\u2019s Mendenhall Glacier has started to release, and officials on Tuesday urged residents in some parts of Juneau to evacuate ahead of what could be a record surge of floodwater downstream.\n\nOfficials in recent days have been warning people in the flood zone to be ready to evacuate. On Tuesday morning they confirmed water had started escaping the ice dam and flowing downstream, with flooding expected late Tuesday into Wednesday.\n\nFlooding from the basin has become an annual concern, and in recent years has swept away houses and swamped hundreds of homes. Government agencies installed a temporary levy this year in hopes of guarding against widespread damage.\n\n\u201cThis will be a new record, based on all of the information that we have,\u201d Nicole Ferrin, a National Weather Service meteorologist, told a news conference Tuesday.\n\nThe Mendenhall Glacier \u2014 a thinning, retreating glacier that is a major tourist attraction in southeast Alaska \u2014 acts as a dam for Suicide Basin, which fills each spring and summer with rainwater and snowmelt. The basin itself was left behind when a smaller glacier nearby retreated.\n\nWhen the water in the basin builds up enough pressure, it forces its way under or around the ice dam, entering Mendenhall Lake and eventually the Mendenhall River. Before the basin reached the limit of its capacity and began overtopping over the weekend, the water level was rising rapidly \u2014 as much as 4 feet (1.22 meters) per day during especially sunny or rainy days, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe threat of so-called glacier outburst flooding has troubled parts of Juneau since 2011. In some years, there has been limited flooding of streets or properties near the lake or river.\n\nBut 2023 and 2024 marked successive years of record flooding, with the river last August cresting at 15.99 feet (4.9 meters), about 1 foot (0.3 meters) over the prior record set a year earlier, and flooding extending farther into the Mendenhall Valley. This year's flooding was predicted to crest at between 16.3 and 16.8 feet (4.96 to 5.12 meters).\n\nLast year, nearly 300 residences were damaged.\n\nA large outburst can release some 15 billion gallons of water, according to the University of Alaska Southeast and Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center. That\u2019s the equivalent of nearly 23,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. During last year\u2019s flood, the flow rate in the rushing Mendenhall River was about half that of Niagara Falls, the researchers say.\n\nCity officials responded to concerns from property owners this year by working with state, federal and tribal entities to install a temporary levee along roughly 2.5 miles of riverbank in an attempt to guard against widespread flooding. The installation of about 10,000, four-foot (1.2-meter) tall barriers is intended to protect more than 460 properties from flood levels similar to last year, said Nate Rumsey, deputy director with the city\u2019s engineering and public works department.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is at the start of what\u2019s expected to be a yearslong process of studying conditions in the region and examining options for a more permanent solution. The timeline has angered some residents, who say it\u2019s unreasonable.\n\nOutburst floods are expected to continue as long as the Mendenhall Glacier acts as an ice dam to seal off the basin, which could span another 25 to 60 years, according to the university and science center researchers.\n\nAssociated Press writer Becky Bohrer in Juneau contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Teacher arrested for Arkansas double murder admits to killing married couple: Police\nClinton and Cristen Brink were killed in a state park, police said.\nA 28-year-old teacher has admitted to murdering the married couple found stabbed to death on a walking trail in an Arkansas park over the weekend in what appears to be a \"completely random\" attack, police said.\nAndrew James McGann, 28, of Springdale, Arkansas, was charged with two counts of capital murder in the killings of 43-year-old Clinton David Brink and his wife, 41-year-old Cristen Amanda Brink, Arkansas State Police announced Wednesday evening.\nThe Brinks were \"fatally attacked\" while out hiking with their two daughters at Devil's Den State Park on July 26, police said. The \"horrific\" assault occurred about a half mile into the park, with the husband attacked first, police said.\nThe children, ages 7 and 9, were not harmed in the incident thanks to the actions of their mother, police said.\n\"We believe that the mother took them to safety, and then returned to help her husband,\" Maj. Stacie Rhoads with the Arkansas State Police said during a press briefing Thursday.\nFollowing a dayslong manhunt for the suspect, McGann was arrested shortly before 5 p.m. local time Wednesday at a barbershop in Springdale, about 30 miles north of the park, police said.\nDuring an interview with police, he admitted to killing the couple, Arkansas State Police Director Col. Mike Hagar said during Thursday's press briefing.\nDNA from blood recovered from the crime scene also matched McGann's DNA, Hagar said. The suspect had sustained cuts on his hands during a struggle with the victims, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation.\nItems recovered from his residence were \"consistent with being involved in this particular crime,\" Hagar said.\nMcGann had recently moved to the area from Oklahoma and had been hired to work at a local school, officials said.\nHe was hired to teach in the Springdale Public Schools district this upcoming school year but had not yet begun employment, according to the district's superintendent, Jared Cleveland.\n\"This individual has not at any time come into contact with Springdale students or the families we serve,\" Cleveland said in a statement, adding that no additional information is available at this time due to the ongoing investigation.\n\"Our entire team extends our deepest condolences to the Brink family. Their children are especially in our thoughts and prayers,\" he said.\nMcGann was a fifth grade teacher in Broken Arrows, Oklahoma, during the 2023-2024 school year, the school district said. He passed required background checks, a Broken Arrow Public Schools spokesperson said.\nThe prior school year, he was employed at an elementary school in Flower Mound, Texas, the Lewisville Independent School District confirmed. He was placed on administrative leave in the spring of 2023 \"following concerns related to classroom management, professional judgment, and student favoritism,\" and he ultimately resigned, the school district said.\n\"An internal investigation found no evidence of inappropriate behavior with students,\" the school district added.\nAsked about a motive in the double homicide, Hagar said it remains under investigation, though he did say it appeared to be a \"completely random event.\"\n\"We have no reason to believe that there was any known association between our suspects and our victims,\" Hagar said.\nThe victims died from stab wounds, and the murder weapon was a knife, Hagar said Thursday. Knives were recovered from the residence's home, but it is unclear if any was the murder weapon, Rhoads said.\nHagar said police received over 500 tips and credited the public's help with bringing the suspect into custody.\nArkansas State Police had also released a composite sketch and photo from behind of a man who was seen in Devil's Den State Park on Saturday, the day of the killings. Police asked for the public's help in identifying the man, who they said was wanted for questioning in connection with the double homicide.\nPolice previously said the suspect was seen leaving the area of the park in a black, four-door sedan, possibly a Mazda, with a license plate covered by tape, police said. The vehicle description was \"critical\" in identifying the suspect, Rhoads said.\nThough he took steps to conceal his identity, the suspect was \"very sloppy,\" Rhoads said.\nOnce they identified the suspect, McGann was arrested within an hour at the barbershop, she said.\nPolice do not believe the suspect was trying to alter his appearance in getting a haircut, according to Rhoads, saying, \"Could chalk that up to school starts next week.\"\nThe Brinks had recently moved to Prairie Grove from North Dakota, police said.\nThe children are safe and in the custody of relatives, according to police.\n\"Our entire state is grieving for the tragic loss and senseless and horrific crime that's taken place,\" Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. \"One of the worst experiences that certainly I've ever had was making a phone call to the Brink family earlier this week. Nothing like that should ever have taken place.\"\nHagar said the Brinks were a loving couple, and credited their two young daughters with helping in the case, saying they are \"in awe\" of them.\n\"The information that they were able to provide to start us down this path, to be able to make this arrest, it all started with those two little girls,\" he said. \"It's incredible.\"\nHagar said the couple has a third daughter who wasn't at the trail that day.\n\"It is my intention to use the full weight of my office to bring this defendant to justice for the Brinks family,\" Brandon Carter, the prosecuting attorney for Washington County, said at Thursday's press briefing.\nThe prosecutor's office will not be waiving the death penalty in the case, Carter said.\nMcGann is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Friday, with an arraignment expected next week.\nAll trails at Devil's Den State Park, which were closed following the killings, will remain closed for now, Arkansas Secretary of Parks Shay Lewis said.\nABC News' Sasha Pezenik contributed to this report."

      "text": "Bursting ice dam in Alaska highlights risks of glacial flooding around the globe\nBursting ice dam in Alaska highlights risks of glacial flooding around the globe\nJUNEAU, Alaska (AP) \u2014 The gray, two-story home with white trim toppled and slid, crashing into the river below as rushing waters carried off a bobbing chunk of its roof. Next door, a condo building teetered on the edge of the bank, its foundation already having fallen away as erosion undercut it.\nThe destruction came over the weekend as a glacial dam burst in Alaska\u2019s capital, swelling the levels of the Mendenhall River to an unprecedented degree. The bursting of such snow-and-ice dams is a phenomenon called a j\u00f6kuhlaup, and while it\u2019s relatively little-known in the U.S., researchers say such glacial floods could threaten about 15 million people around the world.\n\u201cWe sat down there and were just watching it, and all of a sudden trees started to fall in,\u201d Amanda Arra, whose house continued hanging precariously over the river bank Monday, told the Juneau Empire. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when I started to get concerned. Tree after tree after tree.\u201d\nThe flooding in Juneau came from a side basin of the awe-inspiring Mendenhall Glacier, which acts as a dam for the rain and melted snow that collect in the basin during the spring and summer. Eventually, the water gushed out from under the glacier and into Mendenhall Lake, from which it flowed down the Mendenhall River.\nWater released from the basin has caused sporadic flooding since 2011. But typically, the water releases more slowly, over a number of days, said Eran Hood, a University of Alaska Southeast professor of environmental science.\nSaturday\u2019s event was astonishing because the water gushed so quickly, raising the river\u2019s flows to about 1 1/2 times the highest previously recorded \u2014 so much that it washed away sensors that researchers had placed to study the glacial outburst phenomenon.\n\u201cThe flows were just way beyond what anything in the river could withstand,\u201d Hood said.\nTwo homes were completely lost and a third partially so, Robert Barr, Juneau\u2019s deputy city manager, said Monday. There were no reports of injuries or fatalities.\nEight buildings, including those that fell into the water, have been condemned, but some might be able to be salvaged by substantial repairs or bank stabilization, he said. Others suffered lesser damage.\nWhile climate change is melting the Mendenhall and other glaciers around the world, its relationship to such floods is complicated, scientists say.\nThe basin where the rain and meltwater collect was formerly covered by the Suicide Glacier, which used to flow into the Mendenhall Glacier, contributing ice to it. But the Suicide Glacier has retreated as the climate warms, leaving a lake in the basin dammed by the Mendenhall.\nWhile that part can be linked to climate change, the unpredictable ways that those waters can burst through the ice dams and create floods downstream is not, they said.\n\u201cClimate change caused the phenomenon, but not the individual floods,\u201d Hood said.\nThe variability in the timing and volume of such floods makes it hard to prepare for them, said Celeste Labedz, an environmental seismologist at the University of Calgary.\nMore than half of the people at risk from glacial outburst floods are in just four countries \u2014 India, Pakistan, Peru and China, according to a study published this year in Nature Communications.\nOne of the more devastating such events killed up to 6,000 people in Peru in 1941. A 2020 glacial lake outburst flood in British Columbia, Canada, caused a surge of water about 330 feet (100 meters) high, but no one was hurt.\nBecause the ground along the Mendenhall River is largely made up of loose glacial deposits, it\u2019s especially susceptible to erosion, Hood said. The damage could have been much worse if the flood coincided with heavy rains, he said.\nChris and Bob Winter built their house about 50 feet (15.2 meters) off the Mendenhall River in 1981. It flooded for the first time in 2014, an event that prompted them to raise their house 3 feet. It flooded again on Saturday with about 3 inches of standing water, enough to soak the carpets, subflooring and drywall.\n\u201cYou just got to rip it all out,\u201d Chris Winter said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but we can\u2019t live in our house right now.\u201d\nShe said her biggest concern is that they are both in their mid-70s and will probably have to move south at some point.\n\u201cWe raised our family, and they\u2019re gone and nobody\u2019s in Juneau,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll be able to sell it.\u201d\n___\nThiessen reported from Anchorage.

      "text": "Crammed with tourists, Alaska\u2019s capital wonders what will happen as its magnificent glacier recedes\nCrammed with tourists, Alaska\u2019s capital wonders what will happen as its magnificent glacier recedes\nJUNEAU, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Thousands of tourists spill onto a boardwalk in Alaska\u2019s capital city every day from cruise ships towering over downtown. Vendors hawk shoreside trips and rows of buses stand ready to whisk visitors away, with many headed for the area\u2019s crown jewel: the Mendenhall Glacier.\nA craggy expanse of gray, white and blue, the glacier gets swarmed by sightseeing helicopters and attracts visitors by kayak, canoe and foot. So many come to see the glacier and Juneau\u2019s other wonders that the city\u2019s immediate concern is how to manage them all as a record number are expected this year. Some residents flee to quieter places during the summer, and a deal between the city and cruise industry will limit how many ships arrive next year.\nBut climate change is melting the Mendenhall Glacier. It is receding so quickly that by 2050, it might no longer be visible from the visitor center it once loomed outside.\nThat\u2019s prompted another question Juneau is only now starting to contemplate: What happens then?\n\u201cWe need to be thinking about our glaciers and the ability to view glaciers as they recede,\u201d said Alexandra Pierce, the city\u2019s tourism manager. There also needs to be a focus on reducing environmental impacts, she said. \u201cPeople come to Alaska to see what they consider to be a pristine environment and it\u2019s our responsibility to preserve that for residents and visitors.\u201d\nThe glacier pours from rocky terrain between mountains into a lake dotted by stray icebergs. Its face retreated eight football fields between 2007 and 2021, according to estimates from University of Alaska Southeast researchers. Trail markers memorialize the glacier\u2019s backward march, showing where the ice once stood. Thickets of vegetation have grown in its wake.\nWhile massive chunks have broken off, most ice loss has come from the thinning due to warming temperatures, said Eran Hood, a University of Alaska Southeast professor of environmental science. The Mendenhall has now largely receded from the lake that bears its name.\nScientists are trying to understand what the changes might mean for the ecosystem, including salmon habitat.\nThere are uncertainties for tourism, too.\nMost people enjoy the glacier from trails across Mendenhall Lake near the visitor center. Caves of dizzying blues that drew crowds several years ago have collapsed and pools of water now stand where one could once step from the rocks onto the ice.\nManoj Pillai, a cruise ship worker from India, took pictures from a popular overlook on a recent day off.\n\u201cIf the glacier is so beautiful now, how would it be, like, 10 or 20 years before? I just imagine that,\u201d he said.\nOfficials with the Tongass National Forest, under which the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area falls, are bracing for more visitors over the next 30 years even as they contemplate a future when the glacier slips from casual view.\nThe agency is proposing new trails and parking areas, an additional visitor center and public use cabins at a lakeside campground. Researchers do not expect the glacier to disappear completely for at least a century.\n\u201cWe did talk about, \u2018Is it worth the investment in the facilities if the glacier does go out of sight?\u2019\u201d said Tristan Fluharty, the forest\u2019s Juneau district ranger. \u201cWould we still get the same amount of visitation?\u201d\nA thundering waterfall that is a popular place for selfies, salmon runs, black bears and trails could continue attracting tourists when the glacier is not visible from the visitor center, but \u201cthe glacier is the big draw,\u201d he said.\nAround 700,000 people are expected to visit this year, with about 1 million projected by 2050.\nOther sites offer a cautionary tale. Annual visitation peaked in the 1990s at around 400,000 to the Begich, Boggs Visitor Center, southeast of Anchorage, with the Portage Glacier serving as a draw. But now, on clear days, a sliver of the glacier remains visible from the center, which was visited by about 30,000 people last year, said Brandon Raile, a spokesperson with the Chugach National Forest, which manages the site. Officials are discussing the center\u2019s future, he said.\n\u201cWhere do we go with the Begich, Boggs Visitor Center?\u201d Raile said. \u201cHow do we keep it relevant as we go forward when the original reason for it being put there is not really relevant anymore?\u201d\nAt the Mendenhall, rangers talk to visitors about climate change. They aim to \u201cinspire wonder and awe but also to inspire hope and action,\u201d said Laura Buchheit, the forest\u2019s Juneau deputy district ranger.\nAfter pandemic-stunted seasons, about 1.6 million cruise passengers are expected in Juneau this year, during a season stretching from April through October.\nThe city, nestled in a rainforest, is one stop on what are generally week-long cruises to Alaska beginning in Seattle or Vancouver, British Columbia. Tourists can leave the docks and move up the side of a mountain in minutes via a popular tram, see bald eagles perch on light posts and enjoy a vibrant Alaska Native arts community.\nOn the busiest days, about 20,000 people, equal to two-thirds of the city\u2019s population, pour from the boats.\nCity leaders and major cruise lines agreed to a daily five-ship limit for next year. But critics worry that won\u2019t ease congestion if the vessels keep getting bigger. Some residents would like one day a week without ships. As many as seven ships a day have arrived this year.\nJuneau Tours and Whale Watch is one of about two dozen companies with permits for services like transportation or guiding at the glacier. Serene Hutchinson, the company\u2019s general manager, said demand has been so high that she neared her allotment halfway through the season. Shuttle service to the glacier had to be suspended, but her business still offers limited tours that include the glacier, she said.\nOther bus operators are reaching their limits, and tourism officials are encouraging visitors to see other sites or get to the glacier by different means.\nLimits on visitation can benefit tour companies by improving the experience rather than having tourists \u201cshoehorned\u201d at the glacier, said Hutchinson, who doesn\u2019t worry about Juneau losing its luster as the glacier recedes.\n\u201cAlaska does the work for us, right?\u201d she said. \u201cAll we have to do is just kind of get out of the way and let people look around and smell and breathe.\u201d\nPierce, Juneau\u2019s tourism manager, said discussions are just beginning around what a sustainable southeast Alaska tourism industry should look like.\nIn Sitka, home to a slumbering volcano, the number of cruise passengers on a day earlier this summer exceeded the town\u2019s population of 8,400, overwhelming businesses, dragging down internet speeds and prompting officials to question how much tourism is too much.\nJuneau plans to conduct a survey that could guide future growth, such as building trails for tourism companies.\nKerry Kirkpatrick, a Juneau resident of nearly 30 years, recalls when the Mendenhall\u2019s face was \u201clong across the water and high above our heads.\u201d She called the glacier a national treasure for its accessibility and noted an irony in carbon-emitting helicopters and cruise ships chasing a melting glacier. She worries the current level of tourism isn\u2019t sustainable.\nAs the Mendenhall recedes, plants and animals will need time to adjust, she said.\nSo will humans.\n\u201cThere\u2019s too many people on the planet wanting to do the same things,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the person who closes the door and says, you know, \u2018I\u2019m the last one in and you can\u2019t come in.\u2019 But we do have to have the ability to say, \u2018No, no more.\u2019\u201d"

Nearby, friends helped carry boxes out of her family\u2019s garage, which was inundated this week after a lake dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier let rip \u2014 sending floodwaters into neighborhoods like hers that never had to worry about that threat before.\n\u201cWe\u2019re blessed,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody was hurt. Lots of things I love are gone, and I don\u2019t like that. But it\u2019s just stuff, you know?\u201d\nAbout 100 homes and some businesses were damaged by rapidly rising floodwaters that crested around 3:15 a.m. Tuesday, according to initial estimates. In some areas, cars floated as people scrambled to evacuate. Fischer\u2019s daughter, Alyssa, who lives across the street, said the water in the road at one point reached her hips.\nThe waters began receding Tuesday, and water levels had returned to the normal range for this time of year by Wednesday afternoon, the National Weather Service said.\nThe flooding happens because a smaller glacier near Mendenhall Glacier had retreated \u2014 a casualty of the warming climate \u2014 and left a basin that fills with rainwater and snowmelt each spring and summer. When the water creates enough pressure, it forces its way under or around the ice dam created by the Mendenhall Glacier and enters Mendenhall Lake and eventually the Mendenhall River, as it did this week.\nSince 2011, the phenomenon has at times flooded streets or homes near the lake and river, and last year floodwaters devoured large chunks of the riverbank, inundated homes and sent at least one residence crashing into the raging river.\nBut the extent of this week\u2019s flooding was unprecedented, officials said, and left residents shaken as they tried to dry out furniture, books and other belongings during a stretch of warm, sunny weather. On Wednesday, piles of garbage bags and other items \u2014 wood, boxes, sodden insulation and carpeting \u2014 dotted the curbs. A street sweeper was tackling the gray, silty grime the retreating waters had left behind.\nWhile the basin was created by glacial retreat, climate change plays almost no role in the the year-to-year variations in the volume of the flooding in Juneau, said Eran Hood, a professor of environmental science at the University of Alaska Southeast who has studied the Mendenhall Glacier for years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that these floods will persist for some amount of time, again, on a sort of decadal timescale into the future,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are so many different competing factors that work to either increase the volume of the flood or decrease the volume of the flood that we need to be able to quantify that it\u2019s difficult to say how large floods will be in the future without much more detailed modeling of the glacier dynamics.\u201d\nAt some point, Mendenhall Glacier will retreat and thin enough that it can no longer act as a dam, Hood said.\nThe flooding is a reminder of the global risk from bursting snow-and-ice dams \u2014 a phenomenon called a j\u00f6kulhlaup, which is little known in the U.S. but could threaten about 15 million people around the world.\nJuneau, a city of about 30,000 people in southeast Alaska, is reachable only by plane or boat. It\u2019s the height of the tourist season, and the city is already struggling with a housing shortage that could limit temporary accommodations available for flood victims that might need them. Juneau also has limited rental car agencies for those whose vehicles were swamped.\nThe Mendenhall River crested at 15.99 feet (4.9 meters), a new record, topping the level during last year\u2019s flood by about a foot, and the water reached farther into the Mendenhall Valley, officials said. The city said the water reached some homes outside expected flood areas. The valley is roughly a 15 to 20 minute drive from downtown Juneau.\nAlyssa Fischer said that when she went to sleep Monday night, she didn\u2019t think she had to worry about flooding where she lives. Her dad woke her up hours later via FaceTime and alerted her to rising water outside. She helped him move his cars to higher ground, as well as her quails, before evacuating with her 4- and 8-year-old children and pets to a shelter at a local school. She said she noticed the license plate on her truck was bent from the water current.\nOn Wednesday she was relieved that damage to her property was mostly limited to a crawl space and the garage. She had boxes, rugs and other items in her yard and had a fan going to help dry out the garage.\nBut she worries about the future. When she bought the house earlier this year, it was a selling point for her that it was not on the river. After they returned home Tuesday, her 8-year-old daughter asked when the floodwaters would return.\n\u201cI think next year around this time, I\u2019ll be stressed out for sure,\u201d she said. She said she would like to see community meetings about addressing future floods events."

The river crested early last Tuesday at 15.99 feet (4.9 meters), the National Weather Service said, beating the prior record set a year earlier by about 1 foot (0.3 meters).\nThe state has an assistance program that can help with costs to repair damaged homes, with a maximum for an individual or family of $21,250. Other programs including aid to replace essential items, like clothing, and temporary housing assistance for residents displaced by the flooding. Barr did not have an estimate of how many people will need such aid."

More than 100 homes are damaged\nJUNEAU, Alaska (AP) \u2014 An outburst of flooding from a lake dammed by Juneau\u2019s Mendenhall Glacier damaged at least an estimated 100 homes in what has become a perennial hazard for nearby neighborhoods.\nThe lake formed in a basin that was left behind when a nearby glacier retreated. It fills with rainwater and snowmelt during the spring and summer and at a certain point builds enough pressure to force its way out through channels it carves beneath Mendenhall Glacier. Since 2011, the phenomenon has at times caused flooding of streets or homes near Mendenhall Lake and Mendenhall River.\nLast year, a two-story home was swept away by raging floodwaters that also undermined a condo building, prompting some residents to reinforce the riverbank near their properties. Monday night\u2019s damage was less dramatic but more widespread: Local leaders adopted an emergency resolution saying hundreds of homes were affected, including some outside expected flood areas.\nDeputy City Manager Robert Barr said Tuesday that officials were still trying to get a handle on the extent of the damage.\n\u201cI would say over a hundred homes right now,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cI\u2019m less certain about multiple hundreds. Either still possible.\u201d\nThe National Weather Service said the Mendenhall River crested early Tuesday at 15.99 feet (4.9 meters), higher than the 14.97-foot (4.6-meter) crest from last year\u2019s ferocious flood, which devoured huge chunks of riverbank.\nThis year\u2019s flooding reached farther into Mendenhall Valley. There was \u201ca lot more water in the valley, on the streets, in people\u2019s homes,\u201d Barr said. Some streets at one point had 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 meters) of water, possibly more, he said.\nHowever, there appeared to be less erosion than last year, he said.\nNo injuries were reported. Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued a disaster declaration to aid the response and recovery.\nThe river level dropped quickly Tuesday.\nThe weather service late last week said the water level in the basin had reached the top of the glacier and warned people to prepare for flooding.\nThe city also had urged residents to have an evacuation plan and to spend Monday night elsewhere. The city opened an emergency shelter, and about 40 people were there overnight, Barr said.\nHe credited increased monitoring by agencies and use of technology with helping provide more preparation time this year."

      "text": "Supreme Court formally asked to overturn landmark same-sex marriage ruling\nKim Davis, a former clerk who refused gay couples, brought the appeal.\nTen years after the Supreme Court extended marriage rights to same-sex couples nationwide, the justices this fall will consider for the first time whether to take up a case that explicitly asks them to overturn that decision.\nKim Davis, the former Kentucky county clerk who was jailed for six days in 2015 after refusing to issue marriage licenses to a gay couple on religious grounds, is appealing a $100,000 jury verdict for emotional damages plus $260,000 for attorneys fees.\nIn a petition for writ of certiorari filed last month, Davis argues First Amendment protection for free exercise of religion immunizes her from personal liability for the denial of marriage licenses.\nMore fundamentally, she claims the high court's decision in Obergefell v Hodges -- extending marriage rights for same-sex couples under the 14th Amendment's due process protections -- was \"egregiously wrong.\"\n\"The mistake must be corrected,\" wrote Davis' attorney Mathew Staver in the petition. He calls Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion in Obergefell \"legal fiction.\"\nThe petition appears to mark the first time since 2015 that the court has been formally asked to overturn the landmark marriage decision. Davis is seen as one of the only Americans currently with legal standing to bring a challenge to the precedent.\n\"If there ever was a case of exceptional importance,\" Staver wrote, \"the first individual in the Republic's history who was jailed for following her religious convictions regarding the historic definition of marriage, this should be it.\"\nLower courts have dismissed Davis' claims and most legal experts consider her bid a long shot. A federal appeals court panel concluded earlier this year that the former clerk \"cannot raise the First Amendment as a defense because she is being held liable for state action, which the First Amendment does not protect.\"\nDavis, as the Rowan County Clerk in 2015, was the sole authority tasked with issuing marriage licenses on behalf of the government under state law.\n\"Not a single judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals showed any interest in Davis's rehearing petition, and we are confident the Supreme Court will likewise agree that Davis's arguments do not merit further attention,\" said William Powell, attorney for David Ermold and David Moore, the now-married Kentucky couple that sued Davis for damages, in a statement to ABC News.\nA renewed campaign to reverse legal precedent\nDavis' appeal to the Supreme Court comes as conservative opponents of marriage rights for same-sex couples pursue a renewed campaign to reverse legal precedent and allow each state to set its own policy.\nAt the time Obergefell was decided in 2015, 35 states had statutory or constitutional bans on same-sex marriages, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Only eight states had enacted laws explicitly allowing the unions.\nSo far in 2025, at least nine states have either introduced legislation aimed at blocking new marriage licenses for LGBTQ people or passed resolutions urging the Supreme Court to reverse Obergefell at the earliest opportunity, according to the advocacy group Lambda Legal.\nIn June, the Southern Baptist Convention -- the nation's largest Protestant Christian denomination -- overwhelmingly voted to make \"overturning of laws and court rulings, including Obergefell v. Hodges, that defy God's design for marriage and family\" a top priority.\nSupport for equal marriage rights softening\nWhile a strong majority of Americans favor equal marriage rights, support appears to have softened in recent years, according to Gallup -- 60% of Americans supported same-sex marriages in 2015, rising to 70% support in 2025, but that level has plateaued since 2020.\nAmong Republicans, support has notably dipped over the past decade, down from 55% in 2021 to 41% this year, Gallup found.\nDavis' petition argues the issue of marriage should be treated the same way the court handled the issue of abortion in its 2022 decision to overturn Roe v Wade. She zeroes in on Justice Clarence Thomas' concurrence in that case, in which he explicitly called for revisiting Obergefell.\nThe justices \"should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,\" Thomas wrote at the time, referring to the landmark decisions dealing with a fundamental right to privacy, due process and equal protection rights.\n\"It is hard to say where things will go, but this will be a long slog considering how popular same-sex marriage is now,\" said Josh Blackman, a prominent conservative constitutional scholar and professor at South Texas College of Law.\nBlackman predicts many members of the Supreme Court's conservative majority would want prospective challenges to Obergefell to percolate in lower courts before revisiting the debate.\nThe court is expected to formally consider Davis' petition this fall during a private conference when the justices discuss which cases to add to their docket. If the case is accepted, it would likely be scheduled for oral argument next spring and decided by the end of June 2026. The court could also decline the case, allowing a lower court ruling to stand and avoid entirely the request to revisit Obergefell.\n\"Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett seem wildly uninterested. Maybe Justice Neil Gorsuch, too,\" said Sarah Isgur, an ABC News legal analyst and host of the legal podcast Advisory Opinions.\n\"There is no world in which the court takes the case as a straight gay marriage case,\" Isgur added. \"It would have to come up as a lower court holding that Obergefell binds judges to accept some other kind of non-traditional marital arrangement.\"\nRuling wouldn't invalidate existing marriages\nIf the ruling were to be overturned at some point in the future, it would not invalidate marriages already performed, legal experts have pointed out. The 2022 Respect for Marriage Act requires the federal government and all states to recognize legal marriages of same-sex and interracial couples performed in any state -- even if there is a future change in the law.\nDavis first appealed the Supreme Court in 2019 seeking to have the damages suit against her tossed out, but her petition was rejected. Conservative Justices Thomas and Samuel Alito concurred with the decision at the time.\n\"This petition implicates important questions about the scope of our decision in Obergefell, but it does not cleanly present them,\" Thomas wrote in a statement.\nMany LGBTQ advocates say they are apprehensive about the shifting legal and political landscape around marriage rights.\nThere are an estimated 823,000 married same-sex couples in the U.S., including 591,000 that wed after the Supreme Court decision in June 2015, according to the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School. Nearly one in five of those married couples is parenting a child under 18.\nSince the Obergefell decision, the makeup of the Supreme Court has shifted rightward, now including three appointees of President Donald Trump and a 6-justice conservative supermajority.\nChief Justice John Roberts, among the current members of the court who dissented in Obergefell a decade ago, sharply criticized the ruling at the time as \"an act of will, not legal judgment\" with \"no basis in the Constitution.\" He also warned then that it \"creates serious questions about religious liberty.\"\nDavis invoked Roberts' words in her petition to the high court, hopeful that at least four justices will vote to accept her case and hear arguments next year."
