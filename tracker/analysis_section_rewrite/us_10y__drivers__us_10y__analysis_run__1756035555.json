      "feedback": "The draft is a plausible baseline but lacks a crisp, first-principles causal chain and a formal, multi-scenario framework; to upgrade to world-class, rewrite with a tight flow from macro/cloud-AI secular tailwinds to moat-driven revenue visibility, to operating leverage, to durable ROIC and cash flow, and then to valuation/multiples, anchoring every link in the supplied data (e.g., Shopify H1’2025 GMV +27% to $163B, rev +29%, op income +51%; US GMV share >12%; Azure +39% growth and contracted revenue ≈$368B) using the IDs (QFDWCTAYB)(0G3A); explicitly structure baseline/bull/bear paths with concrete catalysts and clear invalidation points (baseline anchored by a Sept rate cut and ~4.23% 10‑year yield per GX057ADL7/SK994CBWR, and a price for oil risk via J99EM2TPZ) and show what would drive a re-rating or a derating; add quantitative sensitivity around ACMR’s 2025 revenue guidance (850–950m) and ~49% gross margin to illustrate margin/ROIC trajectories under moat expansion; ensure every factual claim is tethered to an approved source ID and minimize repetitive phrasing; reconcile conflicts coherently (oil oversupply implies disinflationary pressure that could lift multiples, but persistent energy softness or hawkish shifts could keep risk premia elevated) and explicitly note the decisive signals in a concise watch-list: CPI/payroll trajectories and Fed guidance; cross-asset signals, especially 10-year yields; enterprise cloud bookings and AI-driven revenue visibility (Shopify/Azure paths); and oil-supply/demand updates from the IEA/J99EM2TPZ; finally, tighten prose to avoid redundancy and present the chain in a single, coherent narrative with clear next-step edits and citations (QFDWCTAYB)(0G3A)(GX057ADL7)(SK994CBWR)(J99EM2TPZ).",
