  "title": "Do Wall Street Analysts Like Conagra Brands Stock?",
  "description": "Conagra Brands has significantly underperformed the broader market over the past year, and Wall Street analysts maintain a cautious outlook on the stock\u2019s prospects.",
  "content": "Valued at a market cap of $9 billion, Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG) is a leading packaged foods company headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Its portfolio includes well-known brands such as Healthy Choice, Hunt\u2019s, Birds Eye, Slim Jim, Orville Redenbacher\u2019s, and Marie Callender\u2019s, spanning categories like frozen meals, snacks, condiments, and shelf-stable goods.\n\nThis packaged foods company has significantly lagged behind the broader market over the past 52 weeks. Shares of CAG have declined 36.8% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has soared 21.1%. Moreover, on a YTD basis, the stock is down 31.8%, compared to SPX\u2019s 7.9% uptick.\n\u2022 Supermicro\u2019s Earnings Selloff Explained: Should You Buy SMCI Stock Now?\n\u2022 Amazon\u2019s $36M Bet on Quantum Computing: What Investors Need to Know\n\u2022 AMD Stock Slips After Q2 Earnings, But Here\u2019s Why It\u2019s a Buying Opportunity\n\u2022 Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nNarrowing the focus, CAG has also considerably underperformed the First Trust Nasdaq Food & Beverage ETF\u2019s (FTXG) 8.9% loss over the past 52 weeks and 3.2% drop on a YTD basis.\n\nOn Jul. 10, shares of CAG plunged 4.4% after its weaker-than-expected Q4 earnings release. Both its quarterly revenue of $2.8 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.56 fell short of the consensus estimates and experienced year-over-year declines. Due to a decline in organic sales, driven by softer consumption trends, currency headwinds, and the unfavorable impact of M&A, the company\u2019s top line decreased 4.3% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, on the earnings front, its adjusted EPS dropped 8.2% from the year-ago quarter, missing analyst estimates by 5.1%.\n\nFor fiscal 2026, ending in May, analysts expect CAG\u2019s EPS to decline 24.4% year over year to $1.74. The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is disappointing. It missed the consensus estimates in three of the last four quarters, while exceeding on another occasion.\n\nAmong the 17 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a \"Hold\" which is based on two \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d 13 \u201cHold,\u201d one \"Moderate Sell,\u201d and one \u201cStrong Sell\u201d rating.\n\nThe configuration is more bearish than two months ago, with none of the analysts suggesting a \u201cSell\u201d rating.\n\nOn Jul. 11, Robert Dickerson from Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (JEF) maintained a \"Hold\" rating on CAG, with a price target of $19, indicating a marginal potential upside from the current levels.\n\nThe mean price target of $21.19 represents an 11.9% premium from CAG\u2019s current price levels, while the Street-high price target of $27 suggests an ambitious upside potential of 42.6%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Neharika Jain did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.
