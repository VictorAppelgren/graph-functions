  "description": "Fresh out of bankruptcy, the budget airline says it\u2019s running out of cash and time.",
  "content": "Spirit Airlines has just admitted what many suspected: its future is in serious doubt.\n\nThe news, delivered in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 11, sent the company\u2019s stock into a freefall, plummeting 41% in a single trading session on Tuesday. Spirit\u2019s total market value now sits at a paltry $54.3 million.\n\nIn the filing, the ultra-low-cost carrier said there is \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d about its ability to continue operating for more than 12 months from the date of its financial statements. Translation: Spirit could disappear by August 2026. The company used the expression \u201cgoing concern,\u201d which is an official accounting term that a company is forced to use when it is in severe financial distress and may not have enough money to stay in business. It is one of the gravest signals a public company can send to its investors.\n\nThe airline \u2014 famous for its bright yellow planes and no-frills service \u2014 only emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March after a failed merger with JetBlue. The regulators blocked the merger between the two airlines, arguing that the deal would eliminate a key competitor and drive up fares for consumers. Without the merger, a weakened Spirit was forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which it only emerged from in March.\n\nBut just months later, Spirit says it\u2019s still in a deep financial crisis.\n\nSpirit blames a brutal mix of factors: too much domestic airline capacity, weak demand for leisure travel, and a tough pricing environment that has dragged down revenue. The company reported a $246 million net loss in the second quarter of 2025. In its SEC filing, Spirit said the downturn is expected to last at least through the rest of the year, even after cost-cutting moves like selling spare engines in sale-leaseback deals, reducing discretionary spending, and furloughing pilots in July.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t been enough. The company admitted that its financial results are not improving fast enough to meet the minimum cash requirements of its debt agreements and, crucially, its credit card processing agreement, which expires at the end of the year.\n\nThe airline is now in a last-ditch race for liquidity. It is considering selling off planes, real estate, and excess airport gate capacity. It is also in urgent discussions with its credit card processor, which has requested additional collateral to renew their contract, a deal Spirit cannot afford to lose.\n\nTime is running short. Without a dramatic turnaround or a new source of cash, one of America\u2019s best-known budget airlines could soon be grounded for good.",
