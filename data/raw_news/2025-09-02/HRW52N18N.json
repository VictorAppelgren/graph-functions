  "content": "Gold roared to a fresh record above $3,500 an ounce on Tuesday as traders bet the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this month.\n\nSpot gold briefly surged past $3,508 in New York trading, eclipsing April\u2019s intraday peak, before hovering near $3,600 late morning.\n\nThe metal is up roughly a third in 2025, outpacing most major assets as investors rotate toward havens and away from rate-sensitive trades.\n\n\u201cInvestors adding to gold allocations, especially as Fed rate cuts loom, are pushing prices higher,\u201d UBS strategist Joni Teves told Bloomberg News.\n\n\u201cOur base case is that gold continues to make new highs over the coming quarters.\u201d\n\nThe surge in the price of gold is being driven by expectations that Fed Chair Jerome Powell will deliver the first rate cut since December 2024 at the Sept. 16\u201317 meeting.\n\nPowell \u201copened the door\u201d in his Jackson Hole remarks, while promising to \u201cproceed carefully,\u201d a signal that helped solidify bets on easier policy.\n\nThe next jobs report, which is slated for release this coming Friday, will likely give a clearer indications as to which direction the Fed will go.\n\nSilver joined the party, sprinting through $40 an ounce for the first time since 2011 and notching nearly 40% gains year-to-date.\n\nThe white metal has a double tailwind: it rides gold\u2019s safe-haven bid and benefits from industrial demand tied to solar and other clean-energy build-outs.\n\nMeanwhile, ETF buying has climbed for seven straight months, helping drain readily available inventories in London and keeping lease rates unusually elevated.\n\nWall Street kicked off September on shaky ground as stocks slumped and bond yields spiked, amplifying investor jitters that have fueled demand for haven assets like gold.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 441 points, or 1%, while the S&P 500 fell 1.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq slid 1.6%, marking its first back-to-back 1% drop since President Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs in April.\n\nTreasury yields climbed sharply, with the 10-year note hitting 4.28% and the 30-year yield edging near 5%, as traders weighed the possibility that Washington may need to refund billions in tariff revenue following a stinging legal defeat for the White House.\n\nA federal appeals court ruled Friday that most of Trump\u2019s global tariffs were unconstitutional, asserting that only Congress has the authority to impose such levies.\n\nTrump blasted the decision as \u201cHighly Partisan\u201d and vowed to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding trade policy, combined with the prospect of a worsening fiscal picture, has intensified a risk-off mood.\n\nInvestors also pointed to seasonal weakness as a factor. September has historically been Wall Street\u2019s worst month, with the S&P 500 averaging a 4.2% decline over the past five years.\n\nAnalysts say stretched valuations, coupled with higher borrowing costs, could create headwinds for equities even after a strong August that saw the index notch five record closes and climb above 6,500 for the first time.\n\nWhile stocks retreated, bitcoin inched back above $111,000 but continued to lag behind gold\u2019s rally, highlighting a flight to traditional safe havens.",

  "summary": "Gold hit a new record above $3,500 an ounce due to expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this month. The metal is expected to rise by roughly a third in 2025, outpacing most major assets as investors shift towards havens. The Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, has pledged to make a decision on the policy at the upcoming Jackson Hole meeting. Meanwhile, silver has surged through $40 an ounce for the first time since 2011 and has seen nearly 40% gains year-to-date. The surge in gold is due to the safe-haven appeal of gold and industrial demand tied to solar and clean-energy build-outs.

      "text": "Las Vegas sees drop in number of visitors for sixth straight month: \u2018City\u2019s taking steps\u2019\nThe number of people coming to Las Vegas plunged for the sixth straight month in July \u2014 but its casinos still turned a profit despite the dropoff.\nJust 3.1 million tourists came to Sin City last month, a steep 12% drop from a year ago, according to new figures from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.\nCanadian visits are down 18%, blamed partly on tariffs and political friction between the neighboring countries.\nBut traffic from Mexico, the United Kingdom and Australia is rising, fueled by more flights to the city.\nConvention attendance has been up and down, falling 10% in June before bouncing back in July, LVCVA data shows.\nThe overall downturn is raising alarm across the Strip, where hotels and casinos rely on steady foot traffic to keep restaurants, shows and shops buzzing, according to CBS News.\nA prolonged slump could ripple through Nevada\u2019s economy, where tourism employs hundreds of thousands.\nYet even with fewer visitors, casinos are cashing in. Nevada gaming revenue hit $1.36 billion in July, up 4% from last year.\nThe casinos on the Strip generated $749 million, a 5.6% boost, while revenue at downtown dens rose 3.6%. The numbers suggest tourists who do come are spending more, even as crowds thin.\nTravelers have blasted rising resort fees, $20 cocktails and $40 parking charges, fueling a growing perception that Las Vegas has lost its value.\nSteve Hill, the LVCVA\u2019s chief executive, insists the critics are wrong.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not happy with the downturn but the city\u2019s taking steps to address that,\u201d Hill told reporters on Friday. He argued that Las Vegas still delivers bang for the buck across a range of budgets.\n\u201cThe idea that generally Las Vegas is not a value, that it is overpriced, I don\u2019t think our customers are doing math when they are concerned about a specific issue,\u201d Hill said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re expressing concern about that specific topic, that tends to then move into a narrative around Las Vegas is expensive or Las Vegas is not a value, but if you actually do the math on that, that\u2019s not accurate.\u201d\nPrices in Las Vegas have been climbing faster than the national average, with consumer costs up 2.7% overall and 3.5% for food, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nTourists are venting online about the pinch, with one Reddit user fuming: \u201cIt\u2019s objectively expensive even for \u2018Vegas\u2019 \u2026 maximizing revenue at every turn.\u201d\nOthers pointed to soaring travel and dining costs, with one lamenting a jump from \u201c$99 round-trip flights out of Orlando to $800\u201d and another stunned by an \u201c$18 beer in a plastic cup\u201d and a \u201c$65 lunch for two\u201d that \u201cwas only mediocre Dim Sum.\u201d\nMany hotels are touting discounts like free parking, late checkout and room upgrades to lure customers.\nThe tourism authority is also promoting budget-friendly activities citywide, from free attractions to low-cost entertainment, in hopes of reversing the slide.\nDespite the slump, Hill is betting on a rebound this fall. He cited a stacked events calendar, from NFL games to big-name concerts, and stronger bookings through December.\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe the narrative,\u201d he told CBS News."

      "text": "Nestl\u00e9 fires boss Laurent Freixe for failing to disclose romantic relationship with underling: \u2018Decision was necessary\u2019\nNestl\u00e9 boss Laurent Freixe was abruptly booted on Monday for failing to disclose a romantic relationship with an underling less than a year after taking the reins, the Swiss food giant said.\nThe world\u2019s largest food company \u2014 which has a portfolio of brands that includes Gerber, Purina, Perrier and KitKat \u2014 said an internal investigation found the French-born Freixe had violated its code of conduct, the company said.\n\u201cThe decision was necessary,\u201d Nestle board chairman Paul Bulcke said in a statement.\n\u201cNestl\u00e9\u2019s values and governance form the solid foundation of our company.\u201d\nThe 63-year-old Freixe (pronounced Fraysh) will receive no exit package, the company said.\nIt did not provide any specifics about Freixe\u2019s romantic relationship with the direct subordinate.\nPhilipp Navratil, the 48-year-old boss of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Nespresso unit who has spent 24 years with the company, was handed the top job effective immediately, the company said.\nFreixe joined Nestl\u00e9 in 1986 and rose through senior posts across Europe and Latin America before succeeding ousted CEO Mark Schneider.\nFreixe\u2019s shock departure threatens more volatility for Nestle amid a tough consumer environment and the global threat of trade tariffs. The firm announced in June that Bulcke would stand down next year.\nNestl\u00e9\u2019s stock has fallen more than 17% over the past year, sliding from a 52-week high of $114.65 per share in March to as low as $87.38 last month. It closed at $94.36 on Friday.\nFreixe\u2019s sudden exit is the latest management reshuffle at a global consumer goods and food company this year, including Nestle rival Unilever, Diageo and Hershey.\nKohl\u2019s fired CEO Ashley Buchanan in May after an investigation found he had pushed for deals with a vendor with whom he had a personal relationship, after little more than 100 days in the position.\nNavratil, who started in the company\u2019s internal audit unit in 2001, was appointed to the executive board in January after his successful stint running Nespresso.\n\u201cIt is a privilege to lead Nestl\u00e9 into the future,\u201d Navratil said in a statement.\n\u201cI fully support the company\u2019s strategic direction and the action plan already underway to strengthen Nestl\u00e9\u2019s performance.\u201d"

      "text": "Hacker uncovers \u2018missing\u2019 Tesla Autopilot data in deadly crash, triggering $243M verdict to victims\u2019 families\nA Miami jury has ordered Tesla to pay $243 million over a fatal 2019 Autopilot crash in Florida after a hacker sipping on a Venti-size hot chocolate at a local Starbucks uncovered key vehicle data that the company had claimed it could not find.\nThe verdict, delivered last month in federal court, held Tesla partially liable for the Key Largo wreck that killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and left her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, seriously injured.\nJurors saw evidence showing that Tesla\u2019s own systems recorded a \u201ccollision snapshot\u201d in the moments before the crash \u2014 data the company insisted was missing until a hacker extracted it from the car\u2019s Autopilot computer at a Starbucks, according to the Washington Post.\nTesla had argued the crash was caused entirely by driver George McGee, who admitted he was using Autopilot when he looked down to grab a cellphone.\nThe company told jurors its manual makes clear that drivers must stay alert and that \u201cthis crash had nothing to do with Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology.\u201d\nBut the jury sided in part with Angulo and the Benavides family, which accused Tesla of misleading them for years about what data were available.\nThe hacker, known online as @greentheonly, recovered the deleted snapshot last fall. He found the file \u201cwithin minutes\u201d and confirmed it had been transmitted to Tesla\u2019s servers immediately after the wreck.\nThe reconstructed data showed the Tesla\u2019s cameras spotted a vehicle roughly 170 feet away and a pedestrian about 116 feet out, as the car plotted a path through the couple\u2019s parked truck.\nTesla\u2019s trial attorney, Joel Smith, admitted the company had been \u201cclumsy\u201d but denied misconduct.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t think we had it, and we found out we did \u2026 this is an amazingly helpful piece of information,\u201d he said.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 lawyers countered that Tesla not only failed to warn the driver that the road was ending but also \u201cdeceived\u201d investigators about data it had \u201cbefore the cops even arrived.\u201d\nThe Miami verdict marked a rare courtroom defeat for Tesla\u2019s driver-assist technology. The company has won other Autopilot cases and quietly settled several more, but lawyers say this one cracked open Tesla\u2019s secretive crash data systems in a way that resonated with jurors.\n\u201cThe message from the jury is that \u2018You did something wrong, change what you\u2019re doing,\u2019\u201d attorney Don Slavik, who has multiple Autopilot cases pending, told the Washington Post.\nAlready, the ruling is reverberating beyond Florida. A Texas shareholder lawsuit cites the Miami verdict to allege Tesla defrauded investors over its autonomy claims.\nIn California, another fatal crash case tied to Autopilot is set for trial this fall, with plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys vowing to seek a verdict \u201cnorth of a billion dollars.\u201d\nTesla has asked the judge to throw out the Miami verdict or order a new trial, arguing that the data dispute was \u201cirrelevant.\u201d\nThe company vows to appeal if necessary, keeping alive the legal battle over who bears responsibility when experimental software collides with distracted driving.\nFor Angulo and the Benavides family, the judgment was less about money than exposing Tesla\u2019s handling of the case.\n\u201cWe have this relief that the world knows, but it doesn\u2019t change anything for us,\u201d said Naibel\u2019s sister, Neima.\n\u201cMy sister is not here. And nothing will bring her back.\u201d\nTheodore J. Boutrous Jr., Tesla\u2019s lead attorney in the case, provided a statement to The Post which read: \u201cThis is an important case because unfounded and unconstitutional verdicts like this one against Tesla pose real dangers to safety innovation and technological advancement, creating perverse incentives for manufacturers by discouraging new safety enhancements.\u201d\nBoutrous told The Post that the Supreme Court \u201chas repeatedly warned about the due-process dangers of arbitrary and grossly excessive punitive-damage awards.\u201d\n\u201cThis verdict is a true outlier given the facts and law and we look forward to setting things right,\u201d Boutrous told The Post."
