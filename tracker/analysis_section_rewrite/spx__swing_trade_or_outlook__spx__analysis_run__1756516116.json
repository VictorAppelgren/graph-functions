      "feedback": "The draft drifts from a clean, spx‑centric swing‑trade format and contains several formatting, probability, and causal‑link issues that must be corrected before it can be used by a PM.  \n\n1. **Scenario lines** – The four “Up/Down” lines are fine in structure but the “What to watch” field is overly verbose and identical across all scenarios.  Shorten it to a concise list of the key signals (e.g., “Fed June 12 stance, AI earnings, Q4 GDP, EPAM guidance”).  Ensure each driver is distinct: use “Fed tightening” for the Down scenario, “EPAM upgrade lift” for the Up scenario, “AI earnings beat” for the second Up, and “Weak Q4 GDP” for the second Down.  Keep the probabilities realistic but independent; they need not sum to 100 %.  \n\n2. **Trade line** – The current line is malformed: it mixes percentage‑based entry/stop/target descriptions, repeats the watch field, and lacks numeric price levels.  Replace it with a proper swing‑trade format, e.g.  \n   ```\n   Up | Q4 2025 | 4,004 | 3,992 | 4,008 | 1:1 | Fed June 12 tightening, AI earnings miss, weak GDP, EPAM guidance downgrade (H86O3XRUJ) | EPAM upgrade lift (H86O3XRUJ) | 60% | 70\n   ```  \n   (Use the current S&P 500 level as the base for the 0.1 %/0.2 % adjustments; if the exact price is unknown, indicate the relative levels as above but keep the numeric format).  \n\n3. **Causal links** – Each scenario must explicitly trace the driver to spx movement.  For example, “Fed tightening → higher real rates → reduced consumer spending → lower tech earnings → spx decline.”  Add a brief inline citation (H86O3XRUJ) after the driver.  \n\n4. **Probabilities & confidence** – The trade line’s “Probability %” and “Confidence 0–100” are acceptable; ensure they reflect the evidence cited (e.g., 60 % probability of a 0.1 % upside given the EPAM upgrade).  \n\n5. **Remove extraneous text** – Delete the “Main‑focus check” paragraph and any other commentary that does not fit the required 4‑line scenario format or the single trade line.  \n\nAfter these edits the output will be a concise, actionable swing‑trade outlook that satisfies the canonical mapping to spx, includes a clear causal chain, and meets the format constraints.",
