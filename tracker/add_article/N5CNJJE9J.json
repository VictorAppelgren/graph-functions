      "title": "How Many Nuclear Submarines Does China Have & How Does The US Navy Compare?",
      "summary": "China’s navy now operates roughly 12 nuclear-powered submarines, mainly the Jin‑class Type 094, which can launch JL‑2 ballistic missiles and represent a key element of its strategic deterrent, though they remain noisy and less stealthy than Western designs. In contrast, the U.S. Navy maintains a much larger fleet of 71 nuclear submarines—including Ohio‑class ballistic‑missile boats and a growing number of Virginia‑class attack subs—while planning to retire older Ohio‑class vessels and expand to 66 attack subs by 2054. China has also accelerated its aircraft‑carrier program, moving from a single converted Soviet vessel to three modern carriers and planning a nuclear‑powered Type 004 by 2035, whereas the U.S. continues to operate 11 nuclear carriers and is selling Virginia‑class boats to Australia under the AUKUS alliance to extend forward presence and relieve maintenance and crewing pressures. Both navies face challenges: China seeks quieter, more capable subs like the forthcoming Type 096, while the U.S. grapples with crew shortages, maintenance bottlenecks, and the need to balance surge readiness with routine deployments in a competitive Indo‑Pacific environment.",
