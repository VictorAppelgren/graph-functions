  "content": "The San Francisco rescue\u2019s Instagram-ready new HQ speaks to the growing \"barkitecture boom\" driven by a widening cultural obsession with our pets.\n\nThe carpet is Missoni. That\u2019s what Sherri Franklin, founder and CEO of San Francisco\u2019s Muttville dog rescue, tells me as we walk up a set of stairs with pink zigzag upholstering to the second level of the Adoption Center, one of three overhauled industrial buildings in the nonprofit\u2019s recently renovated headquarters. If designer carpet is the most atypical shelter feature I\u2019ve noticed so far on my visit, a round light that looks suspiciously like an Astro Lighting Eclipse wall sconce also catches my eye. Later, I notice the same sconces decorating the main-level room where the dogs roam, play, and sleep freely, near a few fixtures that either are Constance Guisset\u2019s Vertigo pendant lamps for Petite Friture or, again, are incredibly sufficient dupes.\n\nTo be clear, the Missoni carpet isn\u2019t in perfect condition. It actually looks well-trodden, either from its short so-far life at Muttville, or from one prior. \"We got every bit of furniture donated,\" says Sherri, who operated the senior dog shelter out of her own home from 2007 until 2011, when it moved to its first official cage-free location. Though her oversize frames, patterned pants, and accent scarf, all in a similar ochre that accents her beige sweater and booties, tip me off that expressive style is probably a value of hers, that\u2019s not why there\u2019s so much capital D-decor here. Much of it came from the warehouse of Sherri\u2019s good friend, interior designer Ken Fulk, whose team contributed (pro bono) to furnishing the three-building complex, which was renovated by California firm Tannerhect Architecture.\n\nBeyond possibly being first and foremost a favor for his friend, Fulk\u2019s involvement with Muttville\u2019s overhaul is not such a surprising addition to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The interior designer\u2019s love for animals (and dogs specifically) is a well-established part of his brand, which extends from celebrity home, hotel, and restaurant decorating to his own home decor lines. (A recent New York Times profile said it best: \"What Won\u2019t This Decorator Do?\")\n\nDepending on your proximity to niche news about design or pets, or both, you\u2019ll know that an established firm like Tannerhect stepping in for the architecture is in keeping with the times. There\u2019s a long history of designers dabbling in so-called \"pet-tecture,\" and it\u2019s only grown in recent years as our wider cultural obsession (and subsequent spending) around our pets grows. Where design-y dog houses, beds, and bowls are by now established territory, the \"barkitecture boom\" has more recently extended throughout our homes, from fine-art pet portraits and pottery to mini pet rooms (thank you TikTok) and at-home pet spas (cue: the rise of dog grooming YouTube content). It\u2019s also trickled out beyond them in the form of luxe \"canine kindergartens\" and doggie daycares, and, interestingly, some of the most historically bleak sectors of animal architecture: pet hospitals and shelters. In Fulk\u2019s celebrity-designer echelon, Kelly Wearstler recently designed a vet clinic in Ontario that channels a millennial-branded healthcare start-up\u2014or The Wing for dogs.\n\nSee the full story on Dwell.com: Inside Muttville, the Cage-Free Dog Shelter Designed With Help From Ken Fulk\n\nRelated stories:\n\u2022 None Ronald Rael\u2019s Experiments With Adobe Are Only Getting Started\n\u2022 None Icons Only: Who Better to Restore Two Hallmarks of Gene Leedy\u2019s Legacy Than His Longtime Prot\u00e9g\u00e9?",

Think of it as a spa day for your furry best friend \u2014 a chance to pamper them like the royalty they are. While pet grooming might traditionally be associated with costly competition events, creators are sharing heartwarming, everyday grooming experiences with their adorable pups, and viewers can't get enough.\nDog grooming content on YouTube includes at-home tutorials, grooming montages, comedic skits, step-by-step salon vlogs, impressive transformations, and product reviews. In 2024, there were more than 400M views of videos related to dog grooming.* Amongst the most-viewed content are videos from professional groomers that feature dramatic before-and-after montages and complex challenges (like this video on never-before-bathed farmdogs).\nOn YouTube, the act of dog grooming is morphed into a feel-good experience for viewers. You\u2019re not just watching a dog get a haircut; you're witnessing a transformation, a story of care and compassion. You're heartened by the creators\u2019 genuine love for animals and even the oddly satisfying elements of the grooming process itself \u2013 the rhythmic snip of the scissors, the satisfying removal of matted fur, the final reveal of a clean, happy dog. It's a celebration of the ever-lasting bond between humans and their canine companions.\nFor more on our stylish canine friends and their fabulous groomers \u2014 on the day of the 149th Annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show \u2014 check out our unique YouTube logo today (aka Yoodle) and dig into the following playlist.\n*Source: YouTube data, Global, January 1 - December 31 2024."

Now he\u2019s shifting his focus to a different target: dogs. \"I started with the idea of applying architectural ideals to something the average person could relate to,\" says Hara, who is \"very fond\" of man\u2019s best friend, though he doesn\u2019t own one currently.\nArchitecture for Dogs is a project that goes way beyond the typical doghouse: Hara has engaged 11 top architects and designers to create interactive structures on a canine scale. Each designer\u2014like architects Atelier Bow-Wow, Shigeru Ban, and industrial designer Konstantin Grcic\u2014 was paired with a particular dog breed (dachshund, papillon, and toy poodle, respectively). Hara explains, \"Dogs spend most of their lives looking up at their owners, which isn\u2019t good for their necks.\" Instead, the prevalent idea is to put the owners at pet height while at the same time \"changing the human\u2019s existing built environment.\"\nHara\u2019s hallmark is mixing the accessible and the cerebral, and Architecture for Dogs is no exception. Free downloadable blueprints available on the project website allow anyone to replicate the structures. According to Hara, \"We are very excited to see people put their own unique touches on each design and use whatever materials they have access to.\" And for those who want the convenience of Internet-to-front-door delivery, Hara is planning to produce easy-to-assemble flat-pack versions as well.\nJoin Dwell+ to Continue\nSubscribe to Dwell+ to get everything you already love about Dwell, plus exclusive home tours, video features, how-to guides, access to the Dwell archive, and more.

      "text": "Architecture for Dogs\nArchitecture for Dogs is a visionary and multidisciplinary exhibition dedicated to man\u2019s best friend. For the first time in Italy, and in its second European edition following the 2020 London showcase, the exhibition is being presented in a brand-new version featuring two new Italian-designed architectures by Piero Lissoni and Giulio Iacchetti. These pieces are crafted by Riva 1920, in line with the company\u2019s tradition of ecological and sustainable production.\nCurated by Kenya Hara, an internationally renowned Japanese designer and artistic director of Muji, the exhibition explores architecture and design as tools to examine the relationships between living beings and the built environment. It moves away from the traditional concept of functional spaces for pets and their humans, reimagining them as expressions of shared living.\nThe exhibition showcases ramps, cushions, mats, and benches designed to provide furry breeds with cool refuge from the heat, along with a vertical kennel that bridges the human and animal scale, allowing dogs to gaze directly into their owner\u2019s eyes. Architecture for Dogs offers unconventional kennels and shelters tailored to the specific needs of different breeds, strengthening the bond between dogs and humans.\nIn the era of anthropocentrism, this project flips the paradigm of habitation: pets are no longer mere spectators of human spaces but become conscious protagonists, beneficiaries of designs shaped around their characteristics. It invites reflection on the concept of shared habitats. This initiative challenges conventions, creating an experimental space where \u201cpet-tecture\u201d \u2014 architecture for pets \u2014 takes on an artistic and critical role, encouraging audiences to reconsider this ancient relationship. It responds to a clear societal trend: in Italy, there are approximately 15 million pet dogs, and in Milan, one in two people has a pet. Reflecting this sentiment, the exhibition extends its dialogue to other design fields, such as fashion and textiles, with Giorgio Armani as a partner. In collaboration with Poldo Dog Couture, Armani has developed a capsule collection dedicated to four-legged friends, blending the iconic style of the renowned brand with functional designs.\nThe exhibition design, also by Hara, is presented as a fluid system of display islands, each illustrating a different interpretation of space and the symbiotic relationship between architecture and living beings. The constellation of works, created by internationally recognized names in contemporary architecture, goes beyond the simple kennel or functional space for dogs, exploring new forms of interaction. Through these architectures, the exhibition narrates possible stories of cohabitation, enriched by photographic and video insights. With their playful aspects and meticulous design, these projects evoke a sense of belonging and recognition for the dogs themselves, making design a bridge between animal and human sensitivity.\nThe inclusive nature of the project extends to public participation: anyone in the world can access the designs and instructions for these works by downloading them for free from the official website (https://architecturefordogs.com/). Users can then build these architectures, adapting them to their dog\u2019s needs. This participatory approach reinforces the project\u2019s inclusive character, offering the opportunity to experience and reinterpret the creativity on display, fostering a global community that interprets, builds, and shares.\nArchitecture for Dogs finds in Milan a particularly receptive and aligned context. It not only addresses a deep affection in a playful and unconventional way but also raises complex questions about design as an inclusive language that respects the nature and diversity of its recipients. The ADI Design Museum positions itself as a hub for research and dialogue encompassing all dimensions of contemporary life, both human and, in this case, animal. It is one of the few museums in Milan and Italy to allow dogs into its exhibition spaces, enabling shared enjoyment in a welcoming cultural environment.\nCo-founders:\nImprint Lab / Intertrend\nCurated by:\nHara Design Institute,\nNippon Design Center, Inc.\nDirector:\nKenya HARA\nArchitects and Dog Breeds:\nAsif Khan: Dogs with Black Fur\nAtelier Bow-Wow: Dachshund Smooth\nFGMF: Yorkshire Terrier\nGiulio Iacchetti: Italian Greyhound\nHaruka Misawa: Japanese Terrier\nHiroshi Naito: Spitz\nKazuyo Sejima: Bichon Fris\u00e9\nKengo Kuma: Pug\nKenya Hara: Teacup Poodle\nKonstantin Grcic: Toy Poodle\nMa Yansong: Labrador Retriever\nMVRDV: Beagle\nPiero Lissoni: Yorkiepoo\nReiser + Umemoto: Chihuahua\nShigeru Ban: Papillon\nSou Fujimoto: Boston Terrier\nTorafu Architects: Jack Russell Terrier\nToyo Ito: Shiba\nPhotography and Video:\nCourtesy of Hara Design Institute\nPh: Hiroshi Yoda\nMotion Graphics:\nKenichi Hashimoto\nMusic by:\nSuguru Yamaguchi\nExhibition Design and Graphics:\nHara Design Institute,\nNippon Design Center, Inc.\nSupported by:\nImprint Culture Lab\nProduced by:\nADI Design Museum\nExhibition Partner:\nGiorgio Armani, Poldo Dog Couture\nSpecial Thanks to:\nRiva 1920"

(And here\u2019s what\u2019s keeping the ELLE Decor team happy at home.)\nWhether he is renovating a 1930s Viennese ambassador residence for a transplanted California family or dreaming up a wood-paneled and portrait-lined jewel box for a Park Avenue South coffee shop in New York, Ken Fulk injects all of his projects with an irresistibly maximalist joie de vivre. The San Francisco\u2013based designer\u2019s many recent endeavors include the Las Vegas outpost of Sadelle\u2019s restaurant, the nonprofit Saint Joseph\u2019s Arts Society & Foundation headquarters in his hometown, and the Pharrell Williams\u2013owned Swan & Bar Bevy in Miami, for whose design he received a James Beard Award nomination this week. These days, the socially outgoing Fulk is staying put with his husband, Kurt, in their San Francisco home, where he is finding joy in the couple\u2019s tokens of the many dogs that have kept them company over nearly three decades.\nKen Fulk\u2019s Dog Collars\n\u201cTo some, dog collars may appear to be rather utilitarian things. But for my husband, Kurt, and I, they have become a tribute to our shared past and a touchstone to the magical creatures with whom we share our lives.\nI think it\u2019s safe to say that anyone who knows me is familiar with my devotion to and love for our dogs. These creatures not only fill our days with so much joy, they are witness to the most important moments in our lives. I believe one of the strongest imprints we will take away from the current situation is the time we have spent with them: the hikes, the mishaps, the naps, and the utter bliss of a beast that has no worry for world events, other than seeing us in masks and gloves.\nIn the 29 years Kurt and I have been together, we\u2019ve had nine pups\u2014and five have left us. As a way to remember and honor them, we keep each of their collars as a memento of the life we shared. They sit in a display case in the entry to our master bedroom, the top of which is covered with framed photos of them. Each morning and evening, I pause to pay them respect and give thanks to life and to the four-legged friends we\u2019ve been fortunate to know.\u201d \u2014Ken Fulk, designer and founder of Ken Fulk Inc."

      "text": "Inside Muttville, the Cage-Free Dog Shelter Designed With Help From Ken Fulk\nThe carpet is Missoni. That\u2019s what Sherri Franklin, founder and CEO of San Francisco\u2019s Muttville dog rescue, tells me as we walk up a set of stairs with pink zigzag upholstering to the second level of the Adoption Center, one of three overhauled industrial buildings in the nonprofit\u2019s recently renovated headquarters. If designer carpet is the most atypical shelter feature I\u2019ve noticed so far on my visit, a round light that looks suspiciously like an Astro Lighting Eclipse wall sconce also catches my eye. Later, I notice the same sconces decorating the main-level room where the dogs roam, play, and sleep freely, near a few fixtures that either are Constance Guisset\u2019s Vertigo pendant lamps for Petite Friture or, again, are incredibly sufficient dupes.\nTo be clear, the Missoni carpet isn\u2019t in perfect condition. It actually looks well-trodden, either from its short so-far life at Muttville, or from one prior. \"We got every bit of furniture donated,\" says Sherri, who operated the senior dog shelter out of her own home from 2007 until 2011, when it moved to its first official cage-free location. Though her oversize frames, patterned pants, and accent scarf, all in a similar ochre that accents her beige sweater and booties, tip me off that expressive style is probably a value of hers, that\u2019s not why there\u2019s so much capital D-decor here. Much of it came from the warehouse of Sherri\u2019s good friend, interior designer Ken Fulk, whose team contributed (pro bono) to furnishing the three-building complex, which was renovated by California firm Tannerhect Architecture.\nBeyond possibly being first and foremost a favor for his friend, Fulk\u2019s involvement with Muttville\u2019s overhaul is not such a surprising addition to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The interior designer\u2019s love for animals (and dogs specifically) is a well-established part of his brand, which extends from celebrity home, hotel, and restaurant decorating to his own home decor lines. (A recent New York Times profile said it best: \"What Won\u2019t This Decorator Do?\")\nDepending on your proximity to niche news about design or pets, or both, you\u2019ll know that an established firm like Tannerhect stepping in for the architecture is in keeping with the times. There\u2019s a long history of designers dabbling in so-called \"pet-tecture,\" and it\u2019s only grown in recent years as our wider cultural obsession (and subsequent spending) around our pets grows. Where design-y dog houses, beds, and bowls are by now established territory, the \"barkitecture boom\" has more recently extended throughout our homes, from fine-art pet portraits and pottery to mini pet rooms (thank you TikTok) and at-home pet spas (cue: the rise of dog grooming YouTube content). It\u2019s also trickled out beyond them in the form of luxe \"canine kindergartens\" and doggie daycares, and, interestingly, some of the most historically bleak sectors of animal architecture: pet hospitals and shelters. In Fulk\u2019s celebrity-designer echelon, Kelly Wearstler recently designed a vet clinic in Ontario that channels a millennial-branded healthcare start-up\u2014or The Wing for dogs.\nThe new Muttville shelter comprises 18,000 square feet of interior space: the Adoption Center (with the indoor play areas and offices), Home of New Beginnings (where the dogs go through intake), and Rescue Center (which houses the on-site vet clinic), all connected by a paved courtyard. It\u2019s here where I lay eyes on a Chihuahua named Prince Bayani. He\u2019s lifting a leg on the designated fire hydrant pee patch below artist Debra Walker\u2019s towering Playland mural, which Sherri tells me is a reference to the city\u2019s bygone amusement park. If the shelter\u2019s interiors are colorful, the names it gives its temporary residents match. Over the next few hours, I\u2019ll (happily) be approached for pets, sniffs, and the occasional bark by Corn Bread Stuffing, Dot Com, Cool Whip, Ophelia, and Squeak, among others. (In truth, I\u2019m the one to approach Ophelia, who dons a fuzzy purple sweater and mostly stays put on a futon in the main area, as she\u2019s largely lost her sight and hearing.)\nAs we walk through the courtyard toward the Home of New Beginnings, I ask Sherri about Fulk\u2019s role in the project. He wasn\u2019t directly involved \"as often as I would\u2019ve loved,\" she tells me, but she worked \"very, very close\" with some of his designers. \"He\u2019s always jetting off to Paris...doing a project in Los Angeles and this and that. But we would do, \u2018What would Ken do?\u2019 And then Ken would come with a bunch of different ideas, and then we would sort of make decisions around it.\" She mentions that some of the furniture also came from the San Francisco International Airport\u2019s China Airlines VIP Lounge, which was going through a remodel, as well as another design company that was \"downsizing.\"\n\"I\u2019m not afraid to ask,\" Sherri says. \"I\u2019m not asking for me, I\u2019m asking for the dogs.\" One such dog\u2014a tiny, scraggly one\u2014lets out a small bark from a glass-enclosed intake area that we pass by to enter the Zen Room. Its wood-slatted ceilings, origami-style pendant lights, and Zen garden wallpaper play on the theme. (The room is meant to allow dogs to \"decompress\" upon arriving to the shelter.) I notice an RDL barstool from Andreu World in the corner near a wood-and-rattan dresser and a desk with a small sculpture of a dog meditating.\n\"We talked about what we wanted it to feel like for the dogs and the people,\" Sherri continues as we cross the hall to the Glam Shampoochery, where floral dog wallpaper and pale-pink subway tiles punch up an otherwise standard grooming facility.\nAcross the windy Lombark Street concrete path in the Rescue Center, though, there are noticeably fewer Instagram-y touches. Muttville has a full-time vet staff who work five days a week doing spay/neuter procedures, tumor removals, and dental work, Sherri tells me, to \"get dogs really ready for their new beginning.\" There are a few active procedures happening in the facility, so we only do a quick walk-through, but it\u2019s enough time for one of the vets to bring over a large mason jar filled with discarded dog teeth. \"This is four months\u2019 work of teeth...now we\u2019re only saving canines, the huge ones,\" the vet tells me. When I comment that the teeth look like seashells, the vet replies: \"They don\u2019t smell like it.\"\nWhile I have to imagine that aesthetic touches like Zen garden wallpaper, or, in the Adoption Center, pastel-colored rooms with doorways shaped like houses that nod to San Francisco\u2019s Painted Ladies, seem more for the people than the animals, there are certain areas where it feels clearer how the shelter\u2019s look could also function in the dogs\u2019 favor. From the street, Muttville\u2019s bright-yellow facade with a striped awning and mosaic mural could easily be mistaken for a trendy Brooklyn ceramics studio, if not for its large window with a direct view into the dogs\u2019 open lounging area. It\u2019s meant to draw people in and encourage them stay long enough to potentially make an adoption.\n\"I do think this is the model for the future,\" Sherri says, not long before we pass a couch that, she mentions casually, \"somebody said was worth about $37,000.\" When I try to prod about the costs, she says that while all of the shelter\u2019s designer furniture was donated, buying and renovating the building was...expensive. But she adds: \"It doesn\u2019t have to be done to this large scale...the idea of making it into someplace that is welcoming to humans, not a scary animal shelter. I don\u2019t want people to get scared away and not do what we\u2019re doing because they think, Oh, well they had a lot of money.\"\nThe shelter\u2019s aesthetic in many ways pulls from the book of immersive museums and coffee shops branded for the Instagram generation, the same demographic largely driving skyrocketing pet ownership rates (and, subsequently, new corners of the pet consumer market, from airlines for dogs to senior dog longevity drugs). The point isn\u2019t necessarily creating an upbeat backdrop for a picture, but if an Instagram or TikTok post leads one of Muttville\u2019s dogs to their forever home, that\u2019s a win-win. Muttville team member Patty Stanton tells me the shelter puts a lot of effort into having a fun social media presence; the website also broadcasts a live Wagcam of the dogs every afternoon from the HQ.\n\"We try and be very hopeful in our messaging,\" Sherri says. \"We don\u2019t have the scared shelter dogs. We don\u2019t go negative. We don\u2019t go Sarah McLachlan.\"\nRelated Reading:\nPublished\nTopics\nLifestyleGet the Dwell Newsletter\nBe the first to see our latest home tours, design news, and more."

      "text": "Dwell and Yahoo may earn commission from links in this article. Pricing and availability are subject to change.\nStylish Dog Beds That Aren\u2019t a Nightmare to Clean\nMy dog Archie deserves a bed that looks just as good as he does\u2014and your pet does, too.\nWelcome to Someone Buy This!, a monthly shopping column featuring the fun, the frivolous, and the practical from a very discerning shopper.\nApologies to everyone I know and love, but my dog Archie is the center of my life. I am often thinking about his comfort and overall happiness. If it were possible, I\u2019d spend an ungodly amount of money to hear his thoughts for a day.\nBecause I\u2019m the type of person who spent weeks searching for the perfect placemats, I refuse to settle for basic, paw-print dog accessories for Archie. Thankfully, pet brands are finally catching up to the idea that dog beds are home decor. Style, however, shouldn\u2019t come at the cost of quality or ease of maintenance. I\u2019ve rounded up the best-looking and easy-to-clean dog beds that don\u2019t scream \"pet aisle.\"\nA solid bed with endless cover options\nRuggable\u2019s dog bed dropped late last year and quickly became a favorite for both me and Archie. I went with the bed and the boucl\u00e9 cover, and it\u2019s held up shockingly well. I was skeptical at first, since boucl\u00e9 isn\u2019t exactly known for playing nice with paws, but it handled Archie\u2019s daily digging sessions like a champ. The cover pops off easily on laundry day and comes out of the dryer clean soft and ready for round two.\nBest of all, because it\u2019s Ruggable, you can swap out the cover for something new anytime, like one from their just-launched Jonathan Adler collaboration. I love having the option to update the look when my decor shifts or when Archie finally digs his way through the cover.\nHave you considered leather?\nThis leather bed by Le Dog Company is high up in Archie\u2019s rotation, especially in the summer months. Much like the Ruggable bed, I was initially skeptical. A leather dog bed felt so extra, even for me. I was drawn to the bright-orange zipper on the white bed, so I went for that. Maintenance has been super easy. I vacuum it and wipe it down if it ever gets actually dirty. That\u2019s pretty much it! The brand recommends monthly treatments with their leather cleaner/conditioner but I haven\u2019t found that to be necessary given its one of many beds in Archie\u2019s life.\nA house for cats (or tiny dogs)\nI bookmarked this little rattan house weeks ago after it stopped me mid-scroll on Instagram. It\u2019s definitely on the petite side, better suited for very small dogs or, frankly, the cats that this column has been shamelessly ignoring. The removable and washable cushion makes this bed as practical as it is photogenic. Most crates are eyesores begging to be hidden; this one reads more \"vacation bungalow\" than \"kennel.\" And doesn\u2019t your pet deserve a vacation bungalow?\nA Murphy bed for dogs\nLoribeds, the brand behind the viral direct-to-consumer Murphy bed, also makes one for dogs. It is a fully functional Murphy bed\u2014called the Furphy bed\u2014that folds up to create extra floor space when needed. In true Murphy bed style, this needs to be secured to the wall. It\u2019s a great option for tight spaces and, let\u2019s be honest, a funny conversation piece.\nA dog-sized version of your Rove Concepts sofa\nRove Concepts\u2019 low-profile Porter Sectional, often seen in extremely stylish living rooms, is now available for your furry friends. While the cover is not detachable and washable, it is spillproof. Liquids will literally bead up and roll off like water off a windshield. (You could use an upholstery steamer for a deeper clean, if needed.)\nDesign within (your dog\u2019s) reach\nHAY is one of my favorite brands, always pushing the limits with color and shape without making your space look like a kindergarten classroom. Their color-blocked dog bed is no different. Its tall sides make it perfect for cuddly sleepers. And most importantly the cover is stain-resistant and removable. This bed would fit in seamlessly next to your USM Haller credenza. (And if you\u2019re wondering, yes, USM does make a dog bed.)\nThe dog bed you\u2019ll want to keep for yourself\nI\u2019ve considered buying a Dusen Dusen dog bed not for Archie, but for myself as a floor cushion! The removable cover features the same, soft embroidery as the brand\u2019s pillow covers, which wash really well. This bed is only available in one size, and it\u2019s pretty big, making it better suited for larger spaces.\nWe love the products we feature and hope you do, too.

      "text": "Inside the Tight-Knit Network of Heywood-Wakefield Obsessives\nSpend enough time shopping used midcentury-modern furniture on Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist and soon enough you\u2019ll encounter pieces from Heywood-Wakefield. The circa-1890s American furniture company, which had its heyday in the 1930s through \u201950s, isn\u2019t the most well-known name from the midcentury era, but for its active base of dedicated collectors, it can have a near addictive quality.\nOn Facebook, several dedicated groups including \"Heywood Wakefield Fanatic Collectors,\" \"Heywood Wakefield BST,\" and \"Heywood Wakefield Furniture\"\u2014with 2,60o; 1,800; and 11,500 members, respectively, at the time of writing\u2014provide online spaces for thousands of superfans to congregate and discuss the furniture: how to find it, how to refinish it, and how to live with it. Though some members have purely transactional relationships to the online forums\u2014joining only to find someone to buy a piece they\u2019re offloading\u2014many engage daily with the groups, sharing intel about the identity of a specific furnishing, tips on how to refinish, or photos of their own Heywood-Wakefield\u2013filled living spaces. \"There\u2019s about a third of us who are out there and encourage each other and enjoy looking at the transformation process,\" says Joe Girard, a member of the Heywood-Wakefield Facebook groups who\u2019s earned the \"Group Expert\" and \"All Star Contributor\" badges; the first a designation from group admins marking a trusted source of information for other users, the other awarded by the platform to highly active participants.\nThough Heywood-Wakefield produced furniture in a myriad of styles before it went bankrupt in the late \u201970s, the company\u2019s name is most associated with the solid wood pieces from its mid-2oth-century prime. Designer Gilbert Rohde, who would later help modernize Herman Miller, marked a turning point for Heywood-Wakefield with the Rohde Contemporary Furniture line in 1931. The collection had curvaceous Art Deco-inspired details and modular options that strayed from the traditional and colonial-style pieces the company produced prior (which hold little value on the resale market and haven\u2019t inspired a fraction of the fandom). Though Rhode\u2019s first Heywood-Wakefield collection was crucial for reshaping the company\u2019s identity, the Streamline Modern and Modern lines, unassociated with Rohde, are what most collectors obsess over today. The pieces from that era are also what gave the company its foothold in the 21st century\u2019s MCM zeitgeist, perhaps most notably for very online furniture fans in inspiring the \"Herman Wakefield\" pseudonym (a portmanteau of Herman Miller and Heywood-Wakefield) of the person behind the wildly popular design meme account formerly known as @northwest_mcm_wholesale.\nIn Facebook groups, this obsession manifests through people sharing photos of their own spaces, displaying the wide range in taste of people who appreciate Heywood-Wakefield. (Though you might expect most users to be midcentury-modern fanatics, there are just as many homes with otherwise contemporary furniture.) Users share photos of pieces found for a steal at Goodwill or alert other members to deals on their local Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace listings. When someone asks for tips on identifying a specific piece, people answer using Heywood-Wakefield Modern Furniture, a 1994 \"identification and value guide\" for pieces produced by the company between the mid-\u201930s and \u201960s, written, as the authors state in the intro, to address the lack of \"reliable information\" for Heywood-Wakefield collectors and dealers. Today, the online groups are a way of combatting that same lack of documentation from the company\u2019s heyday, relative to other larger furniture manufacturers.\nMuch like its place in today\u2019s resale market, in its heyday, Heywood-Wakefield wasn\u2019t a furniture company for elites, nor was it the least expensive option. The pieces were an investment that the common person could make knowing that the items would have a long lifespan. \"A lot of people would buy, let\u2019s say, a whole dining room set, and you get a little bit of a price break from that, but they actually made payments on it like you would when you bought a car,\" says Girard. \"You might pay for it over the course of two or three years, but you never bought another set of iron furniture ever.\"\nThe quality of Heywood-Wakefield furniture\u2014constructed from solid wood (Northern Yellow birch), and made largely in factories in the Unites States\u2014is part of what makes it a good buy on the resale market. The pieces also tend to be easier to refinish than other frequently found furnishings made from wood veneer from the same period.\nGirard has spent 16 years on and off refinishing tables, chairs, and other furniture pieces by the brand. After retiring from his career as a teacher, it\u2019s now his main squeeze and he advertises his refinished pieces solely on Facebook. \"I probably have enough to refinish till the day I die, which is a lot,\" he says. \"If I did it, 24/7, 365, I\u2019m not even sure I could still finish everything I had.\" Girard has refinished Heywood-Wakefield pieces that seemed to be destined for the scrap pile, including a recent coffee table that had been burnt with a blowtorch for a burnt wood effect by its previous owner. His Facebook group post received 53 comments and 170 reactions, with multiple commenters thanking Girard for bringing the piece back to life. Others asked for tips on how he approached certain refinishing issues so that they can apply his approach to their own projects.\nOne member of \"Heywood Wakefield Furniture,\" Ryan Maly, took the community\u2019s spirit of resource-sharing a step further by developing custom stains that mimic the Wheat and Champagne stains that are beloved by collectors but hard to replicate. During his development process, Maly offered the stains to Facebook group members to test; now, other users regularly recommended it when newbies join asking for stain advice. \"At this point I don\u2019t find a need to run Facebook ads or SEO campaigns or things like that,\" says Maly. \"People talk and recommend it to each other. It\u2019s a very tight-knit community.\"\nThough Heyw0od-Wakefield furniture stopped being manufactured after the company went bankrupt, some fan-favorite lines have been back in production since the early \u201990s, when two preservationists and a furniture executive bought the rights to the company\u2019s copyright and began reviving its name. Still in operation as Heywood-Wakefield, the company produces new pieces reverse-engineered from original designs\u2014with small modifications that make them more durable\u2014as well as modern pieces, like queen- and king- size beds that weren\u2019t previously in production. The pieces are still created entirely in the United States with solid wood, giving customers reason to believe they\u2019ll have a similarly long life to their 20th-century counterparts.\nAs much as Heywood-Wakefield furniture appeals to its enthusiasts aesthetically, because of its longevity, plenty of people also have deep familial connections to the pieces. Chris Parody of Strictly Hey-Wake, a Maryland store that sells and refinishes solely Heywood-Wakefield pieces, has witnessed this on multiple buying trips. He\u2019s been called in after the death of a loved one, leading to some unusual encounters across the country. \"A lot of times [when I was picking up furniture in person], I would hear from the kids or relatives of the older people who had passed on...they would say how the mother was so proud of her furniture, and she never let us use it,\" says Parody. \"That was kind of nice.\"\nThe Strictly Hey-Wake owner has a lot of repeat customers, including one who\u2019s been buying from him for 20 years, and says he\u2019s had numerous customers who\u2019ve died but made it known that they wanted their Heywood-Wakefield pieces to his shop after their death. \"It\u2019s a weird feeling,\" he says. \"You can\u2019t be happy about getting the furniture.\"\nIt seems the network of Heywood-Wakefield enthusiasts who connect to one another on and offline springs in part from a desire to keep the furniture in the family of appreciators. \"I would say ninety-nine percent of the people that I buy from have a story and are super happy that the furniture is going to go, ultimately, to somebody who will continue its legacy,\" says Girard. \"People want to sell this type of furniture to other people that they know are going to really enjoy it and take care of it,\" Maly adds. \"Not somebody who\u2019s going to put chalk paint on it.\"\nTop photo courtesy Heywood-Wakefield.\nRelated Reading:\nPublished\nTopics\nLifestyleGet the Dwell Newsletter\nBe the first to see our latest home tours, design news, and more."
