      "feedback": "Your draft is on the right track but needs tighter citation, tighter focus on the 10‑yr yield, and elimination of any tangential commentary. 1) Every substantive claim must be anchored to a source ID: add citations for the dollar‑index move, Waller’s dovish remarks, the Fed’s September‑cut probability, the 32‑bp 2‑yr drop, and the Supreme‑Court‑tariff uncertainty. 2) Remove the generic “Fed’s dovish stance” sentence unless you can cite 97MD1FHW8 or 3YAQ8JUPL. 3) The term‑premium discussion should reference 97MD1FHW8. 4) Drop the “stronger‑than‑expected dollar” line unless you can cite 97MD1FHW8. 5) Keep the causal chain concise: core PCE → Waller’s 25‑bp cut hint (3YAQ8JUPL) → market pricing of September cut (97MD1FHW8) → 10‑yr yield 4.20‑4.30% (97MD1FHW8) with tariff‑driven inflation anchoring (1DEM6P1Y2). 6) Ensure the catalyst window is clear: tariff regime until mid‑Oct (1DEM6P1Y2) and the next Fed meeting (Sept 16‑17, 2025). 7) Trim any mention of “Supreme Court decision” unless you can cite 1DEM6P1Y2. 8) Finally, state the key level (4.0%) and invalidation trigger (tariff rollback or PCE >2.9%) explicitly. This will satisfy the acceptance gate and keep the analysis concise, actionable, and fully evidence‑backed.",
