  "content": "Airbnb Inc. has introduced a \u201cReserve Now, Pay Later\u201d feature for U.S. customers, allowing travelers to book certain domestic stays without making an upfront payment.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nThe program, available on listings with moderate or flexible cancellation policies, lets guests delay full payment until shortly before the property\u2019s free cancellation window closes. Airbnb said hosts\u2019 existing cancellation terms remain unchanged and payments are collected before the free cancellation period ends, giving hosts time to rebook if a reservation is canceled.\n\nThe company said the option is aimed at travelers seeking more flexibility, particularly groups coordinating payments among multiple people. The new offering joins Airbnb\u2019s other payment options, including \u201cPay Part Now, Part Later,\u201d which splits payments between booking and check-in, and \u201cPay Over Time,\u201d offered in partnership with buy now, pay later (BNPL) provider Klarna.\n\nAirbnb has been expanding its payment flexibility tools as consumers increasingly favor installment and deferred payment products. The company said the \u201cReserve Now, Pay Later\u201d feature could drive more bookings by lowering the barrier to commitment for cost-conscious travelers.\n\nEarlier this month, Airbnb posted strong Q2 results, signaling resilient consumer demand for travel despite global tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty, but cautioned growth could slow later this year amid new trade levies. The company is pushing a revamped technology platform to expand into longer-term rentals and concierge services, redesigning its app for greater transparency, and deploying a customer service AI bot now used by half its users.\n\nConsumers have been looking for more flexible payment options in recent years. PYMNTS Intelligence estimates that in 2024, BNPL transactions in the United States alone amounted to $175 billion.\n\n\u201cPeople want certainty, especially in an environment where, economically, things are a bit uncertain,\u201d Ed O\u2019Donnell, CEO of Versatile Credit, observed in the PYMNTS eBook \u201cReimagining Consumer Finance: The Strategic Rise of Buy Now, Pay Later.\u201d\n\nIn the same eBook, Seema Chibber, executive vice president for Core Payments in North America at Mastercard, observed \u201cWe\u2019ve literally seen an explosion in the preference for installments \u2026 [with] people seeking expanded buying power, control and financial management, and the flexibility and convenience of a digital experience.\u201d",

      "text": "The traditional pillars of consumer credit are undergoing a profound transformation as \u201cpay later\u201d options, once a niche for specific shoppers, are now redefining how Americans spend and borrow.\nA new PYMNTS Intelligence report, \u201cPay Later Revolution: Redefining the Credit Economy,\u201d highlights this evolution, detailing an ecosystem where traditional banks, nonbank lenders and FinTech startups are both competing and collaborating to offer flexible financing solutions for a widening array of goods and services. From the emergence of metal charge plates in the early 20th century to today\u2019s digital wallets and buy now, pay later (BNPL) models, the industry is fundamentally altering consumption patterns for millions.\nToday\u2019s pay later market is characterized by changing consumer preferences for predictability in managing spending and borrowing, driving the rise of alternative credit providers with innovative underwriting and lending models. These providers have demonstrated the value consumers place on certainty regarding loan payoff over a specific period. The ecosystem now encompasses a broader cohort of consumers beyond those with limited credit, including individuals with established credit profiles who use these options for financial optimization.\nTraditional banks, once the dominant players in consumer lending, are actively adapting their infrastructure, developing their own installment options and forming partnerships with FinTech alternatives to retain customer loyalty and remain central to financial lives. The report identifies five key themes for 2025: the growing consumer appeal for predictable installments, the pressure on banks to integrate installment options earlier in the shopping journey, the blurring lines between short-term and long-term BNPL products, BNPL business models increasingly resembling traditional credit card models with a focus on consumer fees, and a coming convergence between traditional credit and pure-play BNPL providers driven by the demand for payment optionality embedded at checkout.\nKey data points from the report include:\n- 128 million adult Americans used a pay-later product from at least one alternative credit provider over the last 12 months.\n- U.S. BNPL transactions currently total $175 billion.\n- As of mid- to late January 2025, nearly 30% of all BNPL loans were past due.\nBeyond the structural shifts and key market indicators, the report also delves into the differing consumer profiles utilizing pay later \u2014 classifying users by necessity due to limited traditional credit access versus convenience for cash flow management and financial optimization. It examines the complex flow of funds and diverse revenue models, highlighting the shift from purely merchant-funded approaches to hybrid models incorporating consumer fees like interest, late charges and subscriptions.\nThe analysis further touches on the critical roles played by ecosystem stakeholders, including merchants, technology infrastructure providers, payment networks and regulators. The report discusses the uncertain regulatory landscape, noting the potential for increased state-level oversight and the impact of agencies like the CFPB, FinCEN, OCC, FDIC, FTC and Federal Reserve on the evolving industry. Finally, the report highlights the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) in reshaping underwriting, fraud prevention and customer experience."

      "text": "Airbnb\u2019s strong quarterly results on Wednesday showed that despite economic uncertainty due to global tariffs and geopolitical instability, consumers are resilient.\nBut the company, led by CEO Brian Chesky, suggested to investors in a letter to shareholders that things could turn less positive now and in the months ahead, when some tariffs are due to go into force. \u201cWhile we have seen an acceleration of nights booked growth in July, particularly in North America, we are mindful of the tougher year-over-year comparison towards the end of the quarter. This dynamic will continue into Q4, putting pressure on growth rates later in the year.\u201d\nThe online global marketplace for short-term housing rentals reported a notable uptick in global travel demand over April through May, a quarter that included the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs on most countries and on-again, off-again levies on major trading partners, including the European Union. Growth in the number of nights booked in the U.S. accelerated each month throughout the quarter ended June, fueled by a rise in domestic travel. The company reported low-single-digit growth in nights and seats (for tours) booked in North America compared to a year ago.\nThe results show that amid doubts about inflation and economic stability, some consumers are willing to spend at least part of their discretionary income on travel.\nGlobal sales spiked 13% to $3.1 billion, compared to analysts\u2019 consensus estimates of $3.04 billion. Germany showed double-digit growth, as did Latin America, particularly Brazil, Asia Pacific also reported mid-teens growth, driven by accelerated domestic travel and a rise in first-time bookers in Japan.\nThe travel platform has a new growth strategy anchored by a redesigned technology platform aimed at expansion into longer-term rentals and concierge travel services. It\u2019s overhauling its mobile app to make it more like Amazon\u2019s and to become more transparent with its fees. In addition, Airbnb debuted in the spring an AI bot for customer service that the company claims is already being used by 50% of its customers."

Reserve Now, Pay Later gives US travelers booking eligible domestic stays the chance to reserve a listing without paying anything upfront at the time of booking. This marks a major step forward in Airbnb\u2019s commitment to offer more flexible options for guests that may also lead to more bookings for hosts.\nAvailable for listings with a moderate or flexible cancellation policy, guests don\u2019t need to pay the full amount until shortly before the end of the listing\u2019s free cancellation period. Cancellation policies selected by hosts remain unchanged, and because the payment from guests is always due before the free cancellation period ends, hosts have time to secure another booking even if a guest cancels.\nThis feature comes as new data reveals that today\u2019s travelers are seeking more flexibility when it comes to booking a stay, particularly a group trip that requires arranging funds with friends or family.\nWith Reserve Now, Pay Later, guests can secure their booking without an immediate payment, perfect for group trips or budget-conscious planning. In a recent survey of US travelers conducted by Airbnb and Focaldata:\n- 60% of respondents said having flexible payment options is important when it comes to booking a holiday.\n- 55% said they use a flexible payment option with one in ten saying they always use that option when available.\n- 42% said they have delayed and missed out on their preferred accommodation option because of time spent coordinating how to pay for their trip with co-travellers.\nReserve Now, Pay Later complements Airbnb\u2019s suite of flexible payments options including Pay Part Now, Part Later \u2013 where guests can pay a portion at checkout and the remainder closer to check-in \u2013 as well as Pay Over Time with Klarna.\nReserve Now, Pay Later is available for US guests booking eligible US-based listings with a flexible or moderate cancellation policy."
