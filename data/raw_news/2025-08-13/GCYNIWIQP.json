  "title": "Tata Sons shareholders to vote on Noel Tata, 3 others at AGM on Thursday",
  "description": "The online AGM will also review Tata Capital's upcoming IPO, a proposed \u20b964,900/share dividend, and Tata Sons' request to remain private amid RBI listing deadline",
  "content": "Tata Sons Pvt Ltd, the $150 billion holding company of the Tata Group, will seek shareholder approval on Thursday to appoint Noel Tata to its board, along with votes on three other directorships, during its 107th annual general meeting (AGM).\n\nNoel Tata, who became Chairman of Tata Trusts in October 2024, was nominated to the Tata Sons board by the Trusts and appointed as an additional director last year.\n\nShareholders will also vote on the reappointment of Venu Srinivasan and Saurabh Agrawal as directors, and on the appointment of Anita George \u2014 co-founder and CEO of emerging markets growth fund Prosperete \u2014 as an independent director.\n\nTata Sons Executive Chairman N Chandrasekaran is expected to brief shareholders on the planned initial public offering (IPO) of Tata Capital Ltd, slated before September. The board has recommended a dividend of \u20b964,900 per ordinary share, up from \u20b935,000 last year. This implies a total cash payout of \u20b92,622.91 crore, of which Tata Trusts \u2014 which hold 66 per cent of Tata Sons \u2014 would receive around \u20b91,731 crore to fund philanthropic initiatives. The online AGM comes amid strategic shifts under Noel Tata\u2019s leadership at Tata Trusts, including ongoing talks with the Shapoorji Pallonji Group \u2014 which owns 18.4 per cent of Tata Sons \u2014 for a potential exit. Discussions have not yet yielded an agreement.\n\nThe Trusts have also directed the company to remain private. With directors Ajay Piramal and Ralf Speth set to retire, Tata Sons will induct two new board members in due course. The company did not respond to an email seeking comment on the AGM agenda. For the financial year ending March 2025, Tata Sons reported revenue of \u20b938,834.58 crore, down from \u20b943,893 crore a year earlier, when earnings were bolstered by a \u20b99,375.66 crore gain from the sale of investments.\n\nProfit before tax dropped to \u20b935,440.76 crore from \u20b939,813.16 crore, while profit after tax declined to \u20b926,231.74 crore from \u20b934,653.98 crore. Tata Sons repaid all borrowings during the year and ended March with net cash of \u20b97,117.43 crore, compared to \u20b92,679.19 crore a year earlier. With its debt-free status, the company has applied to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to declassify it as a non-banking finance company\u2013upper layer (NBFC\u2013UL) and remain private. The RBI had earlier set a September deadline for NBFC\u2013UL entities to list their shares. Tata Sons' application is currently pending with the regulator.",
