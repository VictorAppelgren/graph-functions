  "title": "Democrats are shedding voters \u2014 but the GOP hasn\u2019t (yet) made the sale",
  "description": "Millions who left the Democratic Party since 2021 are choosing neither major party: Even if they voted for Donald Trump in November, they aren\u2019t willing to commit to the GOP.",
  "content": "This week, news reports finally surfaced what political pros have known for years: The Democratic Party has been suffering an historic decline in partisan registrations since 2021.\n\nA full examination of the data, however, reveals warning signs for both parties.\n\nWhen Joe Biden entered the White House, Democrats had a 10.6 percentage-point lead over Republicans in the 30 states that register voters by party, Louisiana political strategist John Couvillon noted on X.\n\nToday, that lead has shrunk to only 5.6 percentage points.\n\nThose data show a massive, historic shift away from Democrats toward Republicans.\n\nThe share of voters identifying as Democrats dropped significantly during the Biden administration, as I explained ahead of last Election Day in predicting Donald Trump\u2019s victory.\n\nThe exit polls confirmed this shift: Both the network consortium and the Fox/AP VoteCast polls showed more 2024 voters identified as Republicans than Democrats \u2014 the first time that had happened in a presidential election since the 1930s.\n\nThat\u2019s clearly good for Republicans and bad for Democrats, but another trend is equally important: the rising share of people registered as independents.\n\nThat share rose from 30.2% in January 2021 to 32.5% in August 2025, an increase double the 1.1 percentage-point rise in GOP voter registration.\n\nThis means many people left the Democrats only to choose neither major party.\n\nThey may have voted for Republicans in November, but they remain unwilling to commit themselves to the GOP.\n\nThe trend toward independent registration seems to be accelerating this summer.\n\nPer Decision Desk HQ\u2019s Michael Pruser, over 6,000 Nevadans registered as independents in August, while both major parties lost registrants.\n\nIndependents also out-registered Republicans in deep red states like Alaska, Iowa, Kansas and Oklahoma, and they out-registered both major parties in North Carolina, site of one of next year\u2019s most heavily contested Senate contests.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the case as recently as last November, Pruser\u2019s data show.\n\nThe GOP out-registered independents in that month, and added nearly as many new voters as independents and Democrats combined.\n\nThe fact that\u2019s not happening anymore suggests swing voters are holding off during Trump 2.0.\n\nThey may still not like Democrats \u2014 the data this year do not show an uptick in their registration numbers. But they are also leery of Republicans.\n\nThat\u2019s not too surprising, given Trump\u2019s job-approval numbers.\n\nHe currently has a 45.9% approval rating on the Real Clear Politics polling average \u2014 pretty good for him historically, but in past cycles that would have been a sign that the president\u2019s party would lose the midterm elections.\n\nThis is a normal pattern. Voters in flux tend to look at a president\u2019s performance to see if they want to affiliate with his party.\n\nThe registration statistics from California during the Carter-Reagan years are instructive.\n\nIn what was then a swing state, Republicans registered more voters than Democrats between 1976 and 1980. Independents zoomed upward from 786,000 to 1.375 million.\n\nAfter Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1980 victory, the GOP\u2019s Golden State numbers stalled in 1982 as a deep recession took hold, but rapid economic recovery reignited the GOP shift.\n\nCalifornia Republicans out-registered Democrats by a half-million voters between 1980 and 1988, and independents barely budged, adding a tiny 170,000 as state population exploded.\n\nTwo big messages stand out from the historic and current registration trends.\n\nFirst, Democrats have a big problem. From 2020 to 2024, they turned millions of people off to their party.\n\nThey can\u2019t safely ignore these data: Something must be done to reverse the trend and reconnect with Americans.\n\nSecond, Republicans haven\u2019t yet made the sale.\n\nYes, they\u2019re gaining in comparison to Democrats, but even more voters remain on the fence.\n\nThey will have to be convinced by results, just as Reagan\u2019s record convinced many in the 1980s.\n\nThat means it\u2019s not enough for the GOP to start to combat America\u2019s problems; its solutions must make an appreciable difference in people\u2019s lives.\n\nThe Reagan era shows that voters in flux will give a new party a few years to prove its point.\n\nBy 1984, Reagan had shown that inflation could be crushed, jobs and prosperity could return, and America could rearm and confront the Soviet Union without causing a war.\n\nTrump\u2019s equivalent accomplishments will have to look similar: His economic policies could reduce inflation and reignite manufacturing, while his foreign policy could reduce global tensions and restore American power.\n\nThose are tall orders, and it\u2019s not yet clear he can pull them off.\n\nBut the registration data show that America is giving Trump a chance to prove he can.\n\nIf he does, the Democratic decline of the past four years will look pretty good compared to what the party will experience later this decade.\n\nHenry Olsen, a political analyst and commentator, is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.",

      "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s victory, combined with Republicans regaining the Senate majority and keeping control of the House, made 2024 a bad year for Democrats.\nSigns suggest it could be something even worse: a historic defeat that puts Republicans in the political driver\u2019s seat for a generation or more.\nThat\u2019s because the exit poll showed that more voters said they were Republican than Democrat \u2014 for the first time in a presidential election since 1928.\nSuch a result hasn\u2019t happened since talking pictures were new and Babe Ruth clobbered homers in the original Yankee Stadium.\nNo one alive today has ever voted in a presidential race where this has occurred.\nCertainly, Republicans had won elections in the nearly 100 years that have passed since then. But they were always fighting uphill.\nThey had to convince voters who leaned toward the Democrats to give Republicans a chance.\nThat\u2019s why winning candidates like Dwight Eisenhower called themselves \u201cmodern Republicans\u201d and pledged to keep the welfare state that Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal had created.\nThat\u2019s why the two Bushes campaigned as \u201ckinder, gentler\u201d candidates who were willing to expand government.\nEven Ronald Reagan made sure to tell his fans that he had voted four times for FDR.\nHis famous \u201cthere you go again\u201d quip to President Jimmy Carter helped him win, but few recall that he said it in response to Carter\u2019s accusation that Reagan opposed Medicare and would threaten the popular program.\nReagan\u2019s comment emphasized that he had never been opposed to the principle behind the massive entitlement program and would not try to repeal or seriously change it.\nEach of these men knew they needed Democratic votes to win. And getting those votes meant they had to concede important policy points that more partisan Republicans strenuously opposed.\nRepublicans forgot that fact at their peril.\nNewt Gingrich\u2019s historic 1994 victory gave Republicans control of the House for the first time since 1952. Polls even showed the GOP tied with Democrats in partisan identification.\nIt wasn\u2019t fanciful for Gingrich to think he could break Democrats\u2019 stranglehold on power \u2014 but he threw it all away with a budgetary strategy that relied on cuts to popular programs like Medicare.\nPresident Bill Clinton fought back, saying \u201cthe era of big government was over\u201d while promising to protect those social programs.\nBy early 1996, after two government shutdowns failed to budge Clinton, Gingrich was defeated. Polls showed Democrats had regained their historic role as America\u2019s favorite party.\nBut in recent years, the Democrats\u2019 swift movement leftward has undermined their historic position.\nCoupled with President Biden\u2019s incompetence and failure, only 31% of Americans called themselves Democrats this year \u2014 down from 37% in 2000.\nMore voters, 35% in the exit poll, said they were Republicans, with the remainder calling themselves independent.\nThis meant that all Trump needed to do was hold his base and keep his margin with independents close.\nHarris did what Democrats have done for a century: She rallied her base, winning 95% of Democrats, and even won independents by 3 percentage points.\nIn any other election since the Great Depression, she would have won.\nBut in an America that tilts Republican, running the old Democratic playbook isn\u2019t good enough anymore.\nHarris had to woo Republicans to win, and her pathetic use of former Rep. Liz Cheney to do so shows she and her high command had no clue how.\nThis result gives Trump an historic opportunity.\nIf he can expand the GOP\u2019s lead over the next four years, he will have initiated the first realignment since Ronald Reagan brought the two parties to near parity in the early 1980s.\nA world where Republicans lead Democrats by 8 to 10 points in partisan preference is one where Republican preferences and priorities prevail.\nLike the GOP in the last century, Democrats could win only by running as \u201cme too\u201d candidates, offering a slightly less bold version of the Republican agenda.\nThis isn\u2019t set in stone, though: Trump needs to have a successful term.\nIf the economy tanks, or illegal migration continues, or Trump goes to war with China or Russia, voters will flee from the GOP like rats off a sinking ship.\nTrump could also mess up by prioritizing issues he didn\u2019t run on.\nGeorge W. Bush did that in 2005, when he tried to reform Social Security without first getting a mandate to do so.\nBarack Obama, too, in 2009 and 2010, when he made passing Obamacare his focus even after running as a centrist.\nTrump could make either or both mistakes. Failure and fecklessness will be punished.\nBut imagine if he doesn\u2019t.\nImagine an America in 2028 that\u2019s at peace, with illegal immigration virtually ended, the woke tsunami broken and the economy humming.\nThat\u2019s an America whose voters will want to reward the party that gave them what they wanted.\nAnd that reward would put Republicans in the political pole position for the first time since Henry Ford\u2019s Model T was all the rage.\nHenry Olsen, a political analyst and commentator, is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center."

      "text": "Jasmine Crockett calls Trump and MAGA voters the \u2018most unpatriotic people\u2019\nRep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, sharply criticized President Donald Trump and his supporters on Wednesday, calling them unpatriotic during an interview on California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s podcast.\nCrockett said during the interview that Trump tried to use Congress, his administration and the courts to his advantage any time he disagreed with something.\n\u201cWhether we\u2019re talking about those in his administration or whether we\u2019re talking about the courts or whether we\u2019re talking about the Congress, that is one of the reasons he is so desperate to make sure that he can win in the midterms, because he knows that Democrats, it\u2019s not even about partisanship. It\u2019s about doing what\u2019s right. It\u2019s about doing the American thing,\u201d Crockett said.\n\u201cAnd to be clear, you can wave all the flags you want to, but I am telling you right now that the most unpatriotic people that we have in this country are MAGA and this president. We are the real patriots. And it is time for us to take our flag back and show people what America is about,\u201d the Texas lawmaker added.\nShe accused the president of \u201cdecimating\u201d the Constitution and taking freedoms away.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t say that you love the Constitution while decimating it with every single stroke of a pen for an executive order while you are disrespecting our troops who have signed up to protect our freedoms, not just here but abroad, and then taking people\u2019s freedoms away using those exact same troops. I just don\u2019t understand,\u201d she told Newsom.\n\u201cPresident Trump is the leader of the greatest and most patriotic political movement in history,\u201d White House assistant press secretary Liz Huston told Fox News Digital in a statement.\nCrockett and Trump have traded barbs in recent months, with the Democratic lawmaker even calling the president a \u201cpiece of s\u2014.\u201d\nTrump in turn has said Crockett is a \u201clow-IQ person.\u201d\nCrockett said anyone who supported Trump is \u201csick\u201d during a podcast interview with Katie Couric in June.\nThe Texas congresswoman claimed that no matter what political affiliations Americans identify with, they \u201cshould be against Trump.\u201d\nWhen asked by Couric what she thinks of Trump deploying National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles to quell the anti-ICE protests, Crockett slammed Trump for seeking \u201cretribution\u201d and having his own \u201cspecial little army\u201d to carry it out.\n\u201cIt is sick. It is really sick, and anybody that supports it is also sick,\u201d she told Couric. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a mental health crisis in this country because everyone, no matter how you affiliate yourself, should be against Trump. Period.\u201d\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded to these remarks during a press conference in June.\n\u201cThe last time I checked, Jasmine Crockett couldn\u2019t dream of winning such a majority of the public as President Trump did,\u201d she said."

      "text": "Trump\u2019s economic agenda leading to decades-high wage increases, capital expenditures and record tariffs revenue: Treasury\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s handling of the economy has succeeded in bringing some of the biggest increases in a decade or more to tariffs revenue, blue-collar wages and capital investments, a senior Treasury official told The Post.\nThose \u201cABCs\u201d \u2014 described as \u201cAmerica First\u201d trade, a \u201cBlue-Collar Boom\u201d and a \u201cCapital Expenditures Comeback\u201d \u2014 are also rebutting Trump critics who claimed the president\u2019s tax-and-tariff agenda would upend the global economy, said Joe Lavorgna, who serves as counselor to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nAs the US agreed to another trade deal with Japan this month, Lavorgna pointed to Treasury revenue from tariffs topping $200 billion in fiscal year 2025 \u2014 a record \u2014 and approaching \u201cmore than $300 billion\u201d by the end of the calendar year.\nBlue-collar workers have also seen real wage growth of 1.7% since Trump took office, Bessent previously told Post columnist Miranda Devine on \u201cPod Force One,\u201d the highest level of any presidential administration since at least Richard Nixon.\n\u201cThese are \u2026 the laborers, the backbone of the market,\u201d Lavorgna added. \u201cThey didn\u2019t graduate from fancy colleges \u2014 in most cases probably they didn\u2019t graduate from college at all \u2014 that are punching a time check when they come into work.\u201d\nIn the first half of the year, he noted, capital expenditures surged 16.6% \u2014 the largest two-quarter gain since 1997, excluding the rebound coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBusiness equipment production also rose 11% (annualized) in the second quarter after jumping 23% in the first quarter of the calendar year.\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s tied into the One Big Beautiful Bill,\u201d Lavorgna claimed, pointing to provisions that allow businesses to write off production expenses and other investments.\nLast week, Trump touted more than $100 billion in investments for the artificial intelligence and energy industries at a summit in Pittsburgh, one of several events that have spurred economic growth.\nJapan\u2019s trade deal also pencilled in $550 billion in US-based investments.\n\u201cIf you have more capital, people can produce more,\u201d he went on. \u201cYou\u2019re raising productivity and lending standards, living standards \u2026 at the same time, people are taking on bigger paychecks \u2026 that reinforces the blue-collar boom.\u201d\nThe economic shifts are still keeping core inflation to around 2%, while the current consumer price index hit 2.7% over the past year, per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nSome trade deals have yet to be inked that could affect those rates \u2014 including an anticipated deal with the European Union, which Trump recently threatened with up to 50% duties.\nLavorgna said the largest growth sectors domestically have been in communications equipment, computers and AI.\n\u201cAs these trade deals have come through and these other countries such as Japan have committed to making major capital investments in the US, it\u2019s clear that the tariffs have had their desired effect,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the revenues. We haven\u2019t had the inflation, and we\u2019re getting the capital commitments of reshoring here. So to me, it\u2019s a win-win-win.\u201d"

      "text": "Trump ties for highest approval he\u2019s ever had \u2014 as more Americans say US is on right track than any time in 20 years: poll\nThree months into his second term, President Trump hit the highest approval rating he\u2019s ever had as commander-in-chief \u2014 while more Americans say the country is on the right track than at any point since 2004, a new poll found.\nThat\u2019s the good news, according to an NBC News Poll released Sunday.\nThe bad news is that Trump still has not won over a majority of Americans, and 54% said they disapprove of his handling of the economy \u2014 the first time he\u2019s lost a majority on that issue in NBC\u2019s poll.\nEven so, the survey found that voters generally feel Trump is bringing \u201cthe right kind of change\u201d on the key issues \u2014 even tariffs.\nMore Americans support his changes to trade policy (41%) than oppose them (38%), according to NBC.\nThat\u2019s despite the stock market selloff last week as Wall Street grappled with Trump\u2019s decision earlier this month to slap 25% across-the-board tariffs on Canada and Mexico as well as a 20% tariff on China.\nOn many other key issues, voters felt the same way, with Trump\u2019s actions on the border being the most popular \u2014 56% said it was a positive change. On government cuts, 47% said his changes were good, compared to just 29% who opposed.\nEven on his handling of the Ukraine war and NATO \u2014 policies on which he\u2019s received significant pushback \u2014 more respondents said his actions were good (41%) than opposed his actions (40%).\nNBC poll respondents also appear to be cutting Trump some slack on inflation: 40% said his policies are having a positive effect, compared to 30% who said they were having a negative impact, and 28% who said Trump\u2019s policies are not changing things at all.\nIllustrating how the president remains a political Rorschach test for a deeply divided country, Trump\u2019s approval rating among Republicans is 90%, while his figures among Democrats clock in at a paltry 4%, per the poll.\nThat\u2019s the largest gap in approval ratings between a president\u2019s party and the opposition party over the last 80 years, NBC assessed.\nSome 47% of voters in the survey approve of Trump \u2014 compared to 51% who disapprove, marking an all-time high in the poll. He previously hit 47% in early 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic, and in October 2018.\nNBC News\u2019 findings mirror most other polling, with the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate of polls showing Trump with a 48.2% approval rating on average.\nTrump\u2019s approval rating is significantly higher than where it stood at this point during his first term (44%), per RCP, though below where former President Joe Biden was during the same time (53%).\nIn another boost for Trump, NBC News recorded that a two-decade-high 44% of registered voters believe that the country is on the right track, while 54% believe it\u2019s heading in the wrong direction.\nWhile still pessimistic, that marks the most positive outlook on the country\u2019s direction the poll has found since President George W. Bush was in office 20 years ago.\nIt\u2019s also a huge swing from the last administration. Last September, just 28% percent of polled voters told NBC News that the country was headed in the right direction \u2014 compared to 65% who said it was on the wrong track.\nOne of the most significant actions Trump has taken in his second term was to establish the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), something that has sparked protests from government workers and an outcry from Democrats.\nWhile DOGE is unpopular (47% negative to 41% positive), voters generally believe it was a good idea (46%), compared to 40% who say it was a bad idea.\nTrump has steadfastly stood by DOGE and Elon Musk amid political backlash to the cost-cutting initiative, which is intended to help slim down the federal deficit.\nIn a key bright spot for Trump, Democrats\u2019 favorability is at an abysmal 27%, with 55% viewing the party negatively, marking the worst numbers for the party in NBC News\u2019 polling history.\nAnother poll from CNN found a similar result and also pegged Dems with their lowest rating in its polling history, with only 29% viewing the party favorably.\nAdditionally, voters displayed skepticism of the media\u2019s coverage of Trump, with 46% concluding it\u2019s been too critical, while 25% felt it was too supportive, and 24% approved of the media\u2019s approach to him.\nThe NBC News survey sampled 1,000 registered voters between March 7 and 11 with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points."

And everybody was like, \u2018Why didn\u2019t we think of that?'\u201d\nHe offered that as a reason Trump won Nevada in 2024 \u2013 the first time a GOP candidate has done so in 20 years \u2013 because of all the service industry jobs there that run on tips.\nMaher then listed the other groups Trump was able to snag votes from that led to his victory.\n\u201cHe did it with the tips. He got the TikTok vote. He got the people for whom toilets are very important vote. He got the \u2018enough of taking our shoes off at the airport\u2019 vote, the crypto bro vote, the tech bro vote, the bro bro vote,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cHe got rappers and kale eaters.\u201d\nHe also mentioned how Trump was able to secure the former independent candidate and current Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s supporters in 2024, saying, \u201cOh, that\u2019s another \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 four percent he picked off. And they\u2019re ride or die.\u201d\n\u201cTrump runs for office like that kid in eighth grade who ran for school president on a pledge of more snow days,\u201d Maher joked.\nHe continued, saying that \u201celections are won on the margins, by a coalition of little things that hit people personally. Trump gets this, he feels your pain in the a\u2013. Kamala ran on democracy, which is the most important issue. But without the political skill to sell it, it added up to nothing.\u201d\n\u201cMeanwhile, Trump was running on, \u2018I\u2019ll make the poop go down.\u2019 He never shut up about bad shower pressure, s\u2014\u2013 light bulbs, and low-flow toilets. Not exactly \u2018ask not what your country can do for you,\u2019 but for some little niche group, it was all that mattered,\u201d he said.\nRegarding Trump\u2019s efforts to potentially reclassify marijuana, Maher joked, \u201cFinally, he got around to me.\u201d"

      "text": "Democrats facing crisis as more than 2M voters leave party in four years: analysis\nThe Democratic Party is bleeding registered voters, suffering a 4.5 million-name loss that could take years to recover from, according to a new report.\nBetween the 2020 and 2024 presidential elections, Democrats lost about 2.1 million voters across the 30 states that track registration by political party, according to a New York Times analysis of data gathered by the L2 tracking firm.\nOver the same period, the Republican Party gained 2.4 million registered voters.\nOfficially, there are still more registered Democrats than Republicans nationwide, but that number is incomplete because blue states like California and New York allow voters to register by party \u2014 as does the District of Columbia \u2014 while reliably red states like Texas, Missouri and Ohio do not.\nMost alarmingly for Democrats, the decline is nationwide, with the US seeing more new voters registering with the GOP in 2024 for the first time in six years.\nDemocrats also saw their registered voter advantage dwindle in four 2024 battleground states \u2014 Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania \u2014 all of which President Trump carried this past Nov. 5.\nMichael Pruser, who tracks voter registration closely as director of data science for Decision Desk HQ, warned that the numbers not only help explain Trump\u2019s victory last year \u2014 in which he became the first Republican presidential candidate to win the popular vote in 20 years \u2014 but also forecast significant headwinds for Democrats in next year\u2019s midterm elections as well as the 2028 presidential vote.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say, \u2018the death cycle of the Democratic Party,'\u201d Pruser told the Times, \u201cbut there seems to be no end to this.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no silver lining or cavalry coming across the hill. This is month after month, year after year,\u201d he added.\nIn North Carolina, Democrats lost 115,523 voters between the 2020 and 2024 election, with Republicans gaining more than 140,000 members and erasing the Dems\u2019 registration advantage, according to the L2 data.\nDemocrats suffered similar losses in Arizona and Pennsylvania, while in Nevada \u2014 a state whose politics were long dominated by the Las Vegas-based Culinary Workers Union \u2014 the share of registered Democrats suffered the second-steepest plunge of those states measured between 2020 and 2024. (Only deep-red West Virginia saw more precipitous losses.)\nEven Democratic bastions like New York and California were not safe from voter erosion, with Dems losing 305,922 registered voters in the Empire State in between the two elections. In California, Democrats lost 680,556 voters between 2020 and 2024.\nAll in all, Democrats went from enjoying an advantage of nearly 11 percentage points over Republicans in registered voter numbers in 2020 to just over six percentage points across the 30 states and DC in 2024, the Times found.\nIn 2018, more than one-third (34%) of new voter registrations nationwide were Democrats, while registered Republicans made up just 20% of new voters.\nAs of last year, however, Republicans had erased that gap, with party supporters making up 29% of new voters, while Democrats made up 26% of new voters."

      "text": "More than six months into President Trump\u2019s highly consequential second term, Democrats are still looking for their sputtering resistance movement to deliver some big victories.\nInstead, they\u2019ve suffered repeated failures and are responding with an increasingly angry radicalism that has zero appeal to the hearts and minds of most voters.\nA recent Wall Street Journal poll found that a mere 33% of national respondents hold a favorable view of Dems, which the Journal called the party\u2019s lowest point in its polls over three decades.\nIt also found that a stunning 63% of voters hold an unfavorable view of the party.\nThose dismal results are the fruit of a run of bad candidates \u2014 think Kamala Harris and Tim Walz \u2014 and a scattershot strategy that consistently defies common sense and traditional American middle-class values.\nThe impression is that party leaders and high-profile advocates are lurching from one temper tantrum about Trump to another, each delivered with the desperation of a Hail Mary pass.\nThey seem more concerned about the welfare of illegal immigrants, including gang-bangers, than about the physical safety and financial security of innocent, taxpaying Americans.\nComes now the latest example of their zany agenda, this one courtesy of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\nIn a few brief remarks Monday, she managed to prove that the passing years have not dimmed her gift for poor judgment and terrible ideas.\nMajor party headache\nHer new brainstorm threatens to become another major headache for her party.\nAppearing in Gotham with socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, Warren declared that \u201cNew York City is the place to start the conversation for Democrats on how affordability is the central issue, the central reason to be a Democrat, and that delivering on it in meaningful, tangible ways that will touch working families is why we\u2019re here.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a pretty strange thing to say given that it was almost exclusively Democratic mayors, governors and lawmakers who created the affordability crisis she now bemoans.\nShe went on to claim that Mamdani, the 33-year-old nepo-baby radical who won the Dems\u2019 mayoral primary, should be the party\u2019s national face.\n\u201cBring it on!\u201d Republicans say, convinced that he would be a major drag for Dems in the 2026 elections.\nThe GOP would be delighted to run against a party that features a radical leftist who\u2019s never held a real job in his life.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that four years ago, then-Mayor-elect Eric Adams declared himself \u201cthe new face of the Democratic Party.\u201d\nThe idea never gained much traction, with his tenure soon swamped by the tide of illegal border crossers waved in by Joe Biden, as hundreds of thousands made their way to New York for free housing, food and medical care.\nAdams never quite recovered, and that was even before he faced federal corruption charges brought under Biden that the Trump Justice Department dropped.\nNonetheless, the turmoil and critical coverage were such a burden that Adams passed up his party\u2019s primary and is seeking re-election in November as an independent.\nAlthough he and the NYPD deserve great credit for driving shootings to historic lows, recent polls show the mayor\u2019s support is stuck in single digits and sometimes falls below the slice of voters who say they are undecided.\nNY Dems shun him\nAs for Warren\u2019s idea about making Mamdani the national model for the party, she is so deep in fantasy land that she\u2019s even out of step with leading New York Dems.\nThey are avoiding the far-left candidate like the plague, which is what he could be politically in areas that are more balanced than the People\u2019s Republic of New York, where there is just one registered Republican for every six registered Dems.\nAnd so Gov. Kathy Hochul, US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries all have declined to endorse Mamdani, which is an exceptional rebuke to him and his platform.\nNormally, they would reflexively back the winner of the party\u2019s mayoral primary, but they look ahead and see his major positions \u2014 defund the police, hike taxes, boycott Israel and support the anti-Jewish mobs disrupting cities and college campuses \u2014 as a toxic brew that even if it prevails in the city, won\u2019t fly around the rest of the state or across the nation.\nThey see him as a major burden next year, when Hochul will be seeking re-election and Schumer and Jeffries will be trying to guide Dems to victory in their respective chambers.\nOf the group, Hochul has been the most outspoken and explicit in shunning him.\nMamdani\u2019s plan to tax high-income New Yorkers would require legislative approval and her signature, and the governor has made it clear that\u2019s not going to happen.\nDays before the late June primary, Hochul threw cold water on the tax proposals he aims to use to fund his long list of free things, including buses and child care.\n\u201cI\u2019m not raising taxes at a time where affordability is the big issue,\u201d she said in a TV interview.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose any more people to Palm Beach. We\u2019ve lost enough \u2026 so let\u2019s be smart about this.\u201d\nHochul\u2019s answer was surprising in that she\u2019s usually an automatic yes vote for new taxes, congestion pricing being a recent example.\nBut her answer was also clever in that she adopted Mamdani\u2019s theme of an \u201caffordability crisis\u201d and turned it on its head to use it as a reason not to support him.\nShe\u2019s right in the sense that when it comes to affordability, New York governments\u2019 addiction to high spending and taxing already are major causes.\nTrickle-down pain\nCity and state regulations also amount to a mountain of expensive red tape that discourage construction as well as business and job creation.\nHer congestion tax is a good example of the trickle-down impact.\nThe price of every loaf of bread, bottle of beer and bag of potato chips sold in Midtown now includes a portion of the added tax she slapped on delivery trucks.\nMeanwhile, the state\u2019s enormous budget reflects the way the government Mafia grabs a piece of every action.\nAlbany is spending $254 billion this year, more than $100 billion more than it spent a decade ago.\nFlorida has millions of more people than New York, but somehow manages to make do with spending $117 billion.\nThat\u2019s almost identical to the city\u2019s budget alone, which is $116 billion this year, up from $75 billion over the last decade.\nThese exploding expense budgets do not include the numerous \u201coff-the-books\u201d entities such as the MTA, public colleges and universities, the Dormitory Authority and scores of other lesser-known units that spend multiple billions of dollars they collect from the public.\nJust remember: As bad as things are, they can always get worse.\nAnd if Mamdani is elected, everything definitely would get worse."

      "text": "This race is close but I\u2019m predicting Donald Trump wins the Electoral College \u2014 and possibly the popular vote\nLegendary Ohio State football coach Woody Hayes used to say there are three things that can happen with a forward pass, and only one of them is good.\nPredicting elections is like that: You can get it wrong, say it\u2019s too close to call or get it right.\nNo wonder most analysts prefer the middle course, rationally relying on polling margins of error and the unpredictability of turnout to avoid making tough calls in races like this year\u2019s.\nI\u2019ve been predicting elections for 20 years and believe I owe the people who read my work my best estimate of what will happen. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll do again this year, even though every statistical tool we have available says the outcome could be decided by tenths of a point, the political equivalent of scoring a touchdown by inches.\nThe weight of the evidence leads me to predict Donald Trump will win the Electoral College and could under a best-case scenario even win the popular vote.\nI\u2019ll explain my reasoning below. Nevertheless, I\u2019m locking in my final answer: Trump wins the Electoral College 297 to 241, with Kamala Harris winning the popular vote 49.6% to 48.3%.\nCongress goes GOP, too.\nTrump\u2019s victory will also carry the GOP to enhanced majorities in the House and a good night in the Senate.\nIf Trump wins Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as I think he will, the Republican senatorial candidates should also win their races. Coupled with pickups in the last three states Trump won in 2020 where Democrats hold Senate seats \u2014 Montana, Ohio and West Virginia \u2014 Republicans will gain six seats and hold a 55-45 majority, tying their post-1930 high.\nThe House is harder to project with precision, but Republicans should expand their 221-214 majority by three to seven seats.\nTo reach this prediction, I did my own examination of the national likely voter polls and averaged their partisan crosstabs together.\nI found that Harris leads with Democrats by 89 points (94%-5%) while Trump leads with Republicans by 87 points (93%-6%). Harris leads among independents by a mere 2 points (48%-46%). Assuming Democrats and Republicans will have equal share of the electorate, and independents are their typical 30%, that means Harris wins the popular vote by a mere 1.3 points.\nThis is likely an insufficient margin for Harris to win because of the way Trump\u2019s coalition punches above its weight in the Electoral College. His blue-collar, white-heavy voting bloc is a larger share of the vote in the all-important states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\nThat\u2019s why he could beat Hillary Clinton, winning all three of these states, in 2016 even as he lost the popular vote by 2.1 points.\nTrump nearly won the Electoral College again in 2020 even though he lost the popular vote by 4.45 points. Had he lost by only 3.7 points, assuming a uniform shift among the states, he would have carried Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin and won a very narrow Electoral College majority.\nAs I write this, Trump leads in five of the seven swing states, trailing in Wisconsin by 0.2 points and Michigan by 0.5.\nThere\u2019s good reason to think the state polls in Wisconsin underestimate Trump. Pollster Patrick Ruffini found the state had the largest polling errors in 2016 and in 2020, both favoring Democrats by 3 points or more. He also found that as of September, the polls still appeared to be overstating Harris by 2.6 points.\nThis Electoral College gap is a huge one for Harris to surmount. It\u2019s likely she cannot win the election if she wins the popular vote by less than 2 points.\nAnd if the national poll averages are accurate, she cannot do that unless she either has a incredible Democratic turnout or wins independents by more than 5 points in an even-partisan environment.\nParty over personality\nThe Senate is also on the line in this election. Virtually all observers concede Republicans are highly likely to regain at least a narrow 51-seat majority.\nThat\u2019s because retiring West Virginia Democrat-turned-independent Joe Manchin will be replaced by Republican Gov. Jim Justice in one of Trump\u2019s most solid states, and Republican Tim Sheehy is consistently ahead in Montana polls against incumbent Democrat John Tester.\nThe issue is whether Republicans can win any of the other seven Democratic seats they are seriously targeting and whether Democrats can unseat one of the three GOP incumbents they\u2019re taking a shot at.\nIt used to be common for senators of one party to represent states won by the presidential candidate of the other party. That is no longer true. In 2016 and 2020, only one senator (Maine\u2019s Susan Collins in 2020) won while the presidential nominee of the opposing party carried the state.\nIf Trump wins in the swing states, the Republican candidates for Senate should as well.\nSome might protest this conclusion, noting the Democrats are leading in their polls in every one of the most contested states (Arizona, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin). That\u2019s true, but this merely points to another factor of the Trump era: the declining predictive value of Senate polls.\nPolling \u201closers\u201d have won an average of three Senate races per election from 2016 on. And many large states such as Florida, Georgia and Pennsylvania have seen surprise outcomes. Polling leaders are no longer the clear favorites heading into election night.\nIt\u2019s even more telling who comes from behind. Eleven of the 12 \u201ccomeback kids\u201d were from the party whose presidential nominee won the state that night or in the most recent prior election. This simply reinforces the point about the power of party over personality.\nThis means whoever wins each of the key states in play will likely carry their party\u2019s Senate nominee over the finish line.\nIt\u2019s easy, then, to pick the Senate once this principle is applied. I think Trump will win Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Add these four pickups to the two gimmes, and the GOP gains six seats on the night.\nIf Trump does prevail in Michigan, it\u2019s also likely Republican Mike Rogers will become the GOP\u2019s first senator from the Wolverine State since Spencer Abraham won in the 1994 GOP landslide.\nIf this happens, Republicans will hold 56 Senate seats for the first time since after the 1928 election.\nThis also means, however, former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan will not win his Senate challenge. He remains broadly popular in polls and is running well ahead of Trump. The state is nonetheless so Democratic that it would take a polling error of historic proportions for him to win.\nThe same considerations doom the Democratic chances for offsetting gains. It appears Sens. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) will run behind Trump in their states. But Trump\u2019s margin in each is large enough, they should still win.\nIt\u2019s possible Trump\u2019s margins will be so narrow in some of these states that the Democrat wins anyway. It\u2019s likely Rep. Ruben Gallego will do that in Arizona owing to Republican nominee Kari Lake\u2019s high negative name identification. No other Democrat, however, is running far enough on Harris\u2019 share of the vote to think he or she can follow suit.\nCrossover in the House\nThe House is much harder to predict at the district level because there\u2019s a relative paucity of good-quality polls.\nIt\u2019s nonetheless important to note the House is affected by the same trend toward emphasizing party over person that afflicts the Senate. The national popular vote, then, should serve as a tenable guide to the baseline district outcomes and hence toward predicting House control.\nBoth parties are first targeting the so-called crossover seats \u2014 districts where the party holding it is different from the one whose presidential nominee carried it in 2020.\nThere are currently only 22 such seats \u2014 five \u201cTrump-Democrats\u201d and 17 \u201cBiden-Republicans.\u201d (New York\u2019s 3rd was won by Republican George Santos in 2022, but the Democrats regained it in the special election following his expulsion.)\nRepublicans come into the election holding a 221-214-seat lead, with 218 needed to control the chamber. They\u2019re expected to gain one net seat from redistricting, picking up three seats in North Carolina but losing one each in Alabama and Louisiana. That means Democrats need to win a net five contested seats to get to 218.\nIf Harris does win the popular vote by 1.3 points, I think the GOP will pick up at least two of the five Trump-Democratic seats and three to five other seats President Biden won but Harris would likely lose in this scenario.\nIt will probably also win a seat or two outside this range even though it shouldn\u2019t because that typically happens in any election. That\u2019s a range of six to 15 potential gains.\nDemocrats will clearly win some of the Biden-Republican seats. Most in danger are the seats Republicans won narrowly last election that Biden won by 9 points or more without extenuating circumstances (more on that later). There are four seats in that category (OR-5, NY-4, NY-22 and NE-2) that I expect to flip blue.\nThe rest of the potential Democratic gains are tougher. There are four Republican-held seats in California that Biden carried by between 6 and 13 points. You might expect those to easily flip, but California House results do not track the presidential outcomes. Instead, they track the gubernatorial results: The GOP candidate against Gavin Newsom in 2022 won each of these seats. Dems could win some or all of these, but they\u2019re not the layups the national results would imply.\nTwo New York targets \u2014 Reps. Mike Lawler and Marc Molinaro \u2014 also have extenuating circumstances. Biden easily carried these districts, but Gov. Kathy Hochul lost them in 2022.\nAnd recent polling shows Trump running in a statistical tie with Harris in both. They, too, won\u2019t be the low-hanging fruit the 2020 results suggest.\nDemocrats have tough seats to win once you get beyond these. They are looking at four incumbents who represent seats Biden won by 4 or less, the sort of seats Trump might win this year. They\u2019re also attempting to flip six seats Trump won in 2020 by 4 or less. That\u2019ll be hard to do if Trump is doing better this year than back then.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting Democrats lost 13 House seats even though they had the majority in 2020 when Biden won by 4.5 points.\nThese soft predictions will vary if either presidential candidate\u2019s total differs significantly from my call. If Harris does win by 3 or 4 points, Democrats probably will win the net five seats needed to control, plus a few more.\nIf Harris wins by less than a point or Trump wins the popular vote, Republicans should be expected to pick up as many as a net 10 seats.\nThe real losers\nThis close election has stirred already-hot political passions to the boiling point. It\u2019s now commonplace to speculate whether we\u2019ll see politically motivated violence from the losing side\u2019s supporters, musings I have not seen in my three-score-plus years. That should give us pause.\nBenjamin Franklin is reported to have told someone asking him what sort of government the Constitution\u2019s authors had provided: \u201ca republic, if you can keep it.\u201d That is our task after this vote.\nAmerican national identity is uniquely and inexorably tied to our form of government. Take that away, and we dissolve into a messy and toxic brew of peoples divided by race, religion and ethnicity.\nThis essay provides my best estimate of what will happen on election night. I might be wrong, as I have acknowledged. But there is one thing I know: Whatever happens, we must rededicate ourselves to our democratic republican ideals sooner rather than later if we want to keep our nation whole and sound.\nIf your party loses, ask yourself the next morning whether the person who voted for the winner is a fellow citizen or an implacable enemy. If you think the latter, you have decided victory rather than democracy is your lodestar. And if that\u2019s the case with most Americans, our system cannot long endure.\nLosing that, more than losing any election, is a tragedy we should strive to prevent.\nHenry Olsen, a political analyst and commentator, is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center."
