  "title": "Glencore Scraps Plan to Move Primary Listing to New York",
  "description": "Glencore Plc scrapped plans to move its primary listing away from London and reported a fall in its first-half profits, weighed down by weak prices for some of its most important products. Alon Olsha on Bloomberg Intelligence has more on Bloomberg Television. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Walk us through why they're saying that moving their listing is not accretive anymore. Well, it was always going to be a pretty tough case to make moving the listing, but the temptation was there. I mean, it was really born out of the frustration management had with the coal portfolio, the coal heavy portfolio that they have not being appreciated by more ESG minded European investors and the US investors tend to be less ESG focused, particularly in the current climate. There are listed publicly listed coal companies there already. So the thinking was it could potentially drive a rerating, but the move was always fraught with risk. Firstly, significant friction costs moving to listing, but more importantly was indexation. There was no guarantee that Glencore would leave the Footsie and then into one of the big US indices. So it could end up actually harming the valuation instead of benefiting it. The other highlight from the Glencore earnings is the fact that we haven't necessarily seen any clarity on where this $1 billion of cost cutting is coming from. They announced this last week. It coincided with them raising their long term profit forecast. But what do you what do you think could be the winners and losers in terms of them cutting costs? Yeah, well, they've mentioned a few things, but you're right, they haven't been completely clear. There will be some staff reductions. They have consolidated the nickel and zinc units into one unit and it will be a lot of pressure on them to deliver these cost savings in the second half because this was a pretty weak first half. It's the weakest first half they've posted in five years. So there's a lot resting on the second half of the year. They need to ramp up copper output in particular and pretty aggressively and reduce costs there. And they need to deliver these cost savings to satisfy the market.",
