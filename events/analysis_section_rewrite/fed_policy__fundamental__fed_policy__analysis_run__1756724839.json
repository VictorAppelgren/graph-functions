      "feedback": "The draft correctly maps to the canonical handle **UST10Y** and cites the required sources, but it drifts into general macro commentary (e.g., “labor market resilience” and “US growth above 2%”) that is not directly linked to the yield transmission chain. Tighten the narrative to a pure first‑principles view: start with the real‑rate differential (US‑Euro) and the Fed’s policy reaction function; then explain how fiscal‑deficit‑driven risk premia and inflation‑expectation‑driven term premia have decoupled long‑term rates from short‑term policy. Explicitly state that the Fed’s September 2024 cuts have *not* reduced the 10‑yr yield because the supply‑side shock (balance‑sheet contraction) and the demand‑side shock (higher risk premium) offset the policy effect. Quantify the risk premium as the current debt‑to‑GDP ratio (~115%) and the inflation‑expectation premium (~0.5‑0.7 pp). Add a clear causal chain: Fed cuts → expected lower short‑term rates → unchanged or higher long‑term rates because (i) higher fiscal deficits → higher risk premium, (ii) persistent supply‑chain/geopolitical shocks → sticky inflation → higher term premium, (iii) Fed’s balance‑sheet contraction → higher Treasury supply → upward pressure. For catalysts, keep September 2024 (policy shift), 2025 fiscal‑deficit releases, and 2026 balance‑sheet contraction, but add the 2025‑26 BoP data as a secondary trigger. Remove any mention of Mizuho/MUFG or the Chinese stocks article. Conclude with a concise base‑case (4.5 % → 4.7‑4.9 % by mid‑2027), key risks (persistent high risk premium, delayed fiscal consolidation), and watch list (Fed guidance, inflation CPI, fiscal deficit, BoP, term‑premium spreads). This keeps the piece strictly within the UST10Y canonical handle, provides a coherent causal chain, and meets the multi‑year structural horizon requirement.",
