      "title": "Crude Prices Plunge on US Economic Concerns",
      "summary": "Crude oil and gasoline prices fell sharply in September, with WTI down 2.79% and RBOB down 2.54%, driven by weaker-than-expected U.S. payrolls and ISM manufacturing data, and concerns that President Trump’s new tariff policy could dampen global energy demand. The slump was compounded by a 2‑week low in the S&P 500, which eroded confidence in the economic outlook. Support for oil prices came from OPEC+ discussions of a production pause and the possibility of a supply shock if Russian exports are further restricted by U.S. sanctions.",
