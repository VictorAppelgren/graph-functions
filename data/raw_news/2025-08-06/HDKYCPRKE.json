  "description": "Gaming company Inspired (NASDAQ:INSE) reported Q2 CY2025 results beating Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 6.2% year on year to $80.3 million. Its non-GAAP loss of $0.19 per share was significantly below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.",
  "content": "Gaming company Inspired (NASDAQ:INSE) reported Q2 CY2025 results beating Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations , with sales up 6.2% year on year to $80.3 million. Its non-GAAP loss of $0.19 per share was significantly below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\n\nIs now the time to buy Inspired? Find out in our full research report.\n\u2022 Operating Margin: 9.8%, down from 12.4% in the same quarter last year\n\u2022 Free Cash Flow was $3 million, up from -$13.9 million in the same quarter last year\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to deliver another strong quarter, underscoring the continued strength across our diversified business model,\u201d said Lorne Weil, Executive Chairman of Inspired.\n\nSpecializing in digital casino gaming, Inspired (NASDAQ:INSE) is a provider of gaming hardware, virtual sports platforms, and server-based gaming systems.\n\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Over the last five years, Inspired grew its sales at a 13.4% compounded annual growth rate. Although this growth is acceptable on an absolute basis, it fell short of our standards for the consumer discretionary sector, which enjoys a number of secular tailwinds.\n\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within consumer discretionary, product cycles are short and revenue can be hit-driven due to rapidly changing trends and consumer preferences. Inspired\u2019s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 1.1% over the last two years was below its five-year trend.\n\nInspired also breaks out the revenue for its three most important segments: Gaming, Leisure, and Virtual Sports, which are 33.9%, 11.5%, and 37.7% of revenue. Over the last two years, Inspired\u2019s Gaming revenue (land-based casino games) was flat while its Leisure revenue (gaming terminals and amusement machines) averaged year-on-year 4.2% declines. A silver lining was Virtual Sports (digital gaming and sports betting), which averaged 4.1% growth.\n\nThis quarter, Inspired reported year-on-year revenue growth of 6.2%, and its $80.3 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 6.8%.\n\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 1.3% over the next 12 months, a slight deceleration versus the last two years. This projection is underwhelming and suggests its products and services will see some demand headwinds.",

      "text": "Inspired (INSE)\nWe aren\u2019t fans of Inspired. Its underwhelming revenue growth and failure to generate meaningful free cash flow is a concerning trend.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy Inspired Is Not Exciting\nSpecializing in digital casino gaming, Inspired (NASDAQ:INSE) is a provider of gaming hardware, virtual sports platforms, and server-based gaming systems.\n- Demand will likely fall over the next 12 months as Wall Street expects flat revenue\n- Ability to fund investments or reward shareholders with increased buybacks or dividends is restricted by its weak free cash flow margin of 3.5% for the last two years\n- On the plus side, its market-beating returns on capital illustrate that management has a knack for investing in profitable ventures, and its rising returns show it\u2019s making even more lucrative bets\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Inspired\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Inspired\nAt $8.82 per share, Inspired trades at 2.3x forward EV-to-EBITDA. The current valuation may be appropriate, but we\u2019re still not buyers of the stock.\nWe\u2019d rather pay a premium for quality. Cheap stocks can look like a great deal at first glance, but they can be value traps. Less earnings power means more reliance on a re-rating to generate good returns; this can be an unlikely scenario for low-quality companies.\n3. Inspired (INSE) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nGaming company Inspired (NASDAQ:INSE) beat Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales up 6.2% year on year to $80.3 million. Its non-GAAP loss of $0.19 per share was significantly below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nInspired (INSE) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $80.3 million vs analyst estimates of $75.2 million (6.2% year-on-year growth, 6.8% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: -$0.19 vs analyst estimates of $0.01 (significant miss)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $28.4 million vs analyst estimates of $25.36 million (35.4% margin, 12% beat)\n- Operating Margin: 9.8%, down from 12.4% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow was $3 million, up from -$13.9 million in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $237.4 million\nCompany Overview\nSpecializing in digital casino gaming, Inspired (NASDAQ:INSE) is a provider of gaming hardware, virtual sports platforms, and server-based gaming systems.\nThe company was founded to create advanced digital games with engaging user experiences and realistic graphics. Its products include physical machines like interactive gaming terminals that are placed on casino floors as well as online games.\nInspired generates revenue through the sale and leasing of gaming systems to operators along with service fees. Its customers include casino operators and online casinos.\n4. Gaming Solutions\nGaming solution companies operate in a dynamic and evolving market, and the digital transformation of the gaming industry presents significant opportunities for innovation and growth, whether it be immersive slot machine terminals or mobile sports betting. However, the gaming solution industry is not without its challenges. Regulatory compliance is a crucial consideration as companies must navigate a complex and often fragmented regulatory landscape across different jurisdictions. Changes in regulations can impact product offerings, operational practices, and market access, requiring companies to maintain flexibility and adaptability in their business strategies. Additionally, the competitive nature of the industry necessitates continuous investment in research and development to stay ahead of competitors and meet evolving consumer demands.\nCompetitors in the gaming technology and entertainment sector include Everi (NYSE:EVRI), PlayAGS (NYSE:AGS), and Light & Wonder (NASDAQ:LNW).\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Over the last five years, Inspired grew its sales at a 13.4% compounded annual growth rate. Although this growth is acceptable on an absolute basis, it fell short of our standards for the consumer discretionary sector, which enjoys a number of secular tailwinds.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or trend. Inspired\u2019s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 1.1% over the last two years was below its five-year trend.\nWe can better understand the company\u2019s revenue dynamics by analyzing its three most important segments: Gaming, Leisure, and Virtual Sports, which are 33.9%, 11.5%, and 37.7% of revenue. Over the last two years, Inspired\u2019s Gaming revenue (land-based casino games) was flat while its Leisure revenue (gaming terminals and amusement machines) averaged year-on-year 4.2% declines. A silver lining was Virtual Sports (digital gaming and sports betting), which averaged 4.1% growth.\nThis quarter, Inspired reported year-on-year revenue growth of 6.2%, and its $80.3 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 6.8%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 1.3% over the next 12 months, a slight deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and suggests its products and services will see some demand headwinds.\n6. Operating Margin\nInspired\u2019s operating margin has been trending up over the last 12 months and averaged 10.1% over the last two years. Its profitability was higher than the broader consumer discretionary sector, showing it did a decent job managing its expenses.\nThis quarter, Inspired generated an operating margin profit margin of 9.8%, down 2.6 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses grew faster than its revenue.\n7. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nInspired\u2019s full-year EPS flipped from negative to positive over the last five years. This is encouraging and shows it\u2019s at a critical moment in its life.\nIn Q2, Inspired reported adjusted EPS at negative $0.19, down from $0.20 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts\u2019 estimates, but we care more about long-term adjusted EPS growth than short-term movements. We also like to analyze expected EPS growth based on Wall Street analysts\u2019 consensus projections, but there is insufficient data.\n8. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nInspired has shown poor cash profitability over the last two years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 1.8%, lousy for a consumer discretionary business.\nInspired\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $3 million in Q2, equivalent to a 3.7% margin. Its cash flow turned positive after being negative in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t read too much into the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, leading to temporary swings. Long-term trends are more important.\n9. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAlthough Inspired hasn\u2019t been the highest-quality company lately, it found a few growth initiatives in the past that worked out wonderfully. Its five-year average ROIC was 25.3%, splendid for a consumer discretionary business.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. On average, Inspired\u2019s ROIC increased by 2.9 percentage points annually over the last few years. This is a good sign, and if its returns keep rising, there\u2019s a chance it could evolve into an investable business.\n10. Balance Sheet Assessment\nInspired reported $46.3 million of cash and $358.6 million of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $107.8 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Inspired\u2019s 2.9\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $16 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n11. Key Takeaways from Inspired\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe enjoyed seeing Inspired beat analysts\u2019 revenue and EBITDA expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its EPS missed. Overall, this print had some key positives. The stock remained flat at $8.82 immediately after reporting.\n12. Is Now The Time To Buy Inspired?\nUpdated: August 6, 2025 at 8:25 AM EDT\nA common mistake we notice when investors are deciding whether to buy a stock or not is that they simply look at the latest earnings results. Business quality and valuation matter more, so we urge you to understand these dynamics as well.\nInspired isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. To kick things off, its revenue growth was mediocre over the last five years, and analysts expect its demand to deteriorate over the next 12 months. And while Inspired\u2019s stellar ROIC suggests it has been a well-run company historically, its low free cash flow margins give it little breathing room.\nInspired\u2019s EV-to-EBITDA ratio based on the next 12 months is 2.3x. This valuation multiple is fair, but we don\u2019t have much faith in the company. We're fairly confident there are better investments elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $13.33 on the company (compared to the current share price of $8.82).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

The company's long-term growth has been underwhelming, with a compounded annual growth rate of 13.4% over five years, but recent performance shows a slowdown, particularly in its Gaming and Leisure segments.",
