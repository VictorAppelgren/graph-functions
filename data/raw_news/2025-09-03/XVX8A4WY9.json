  "description": "When Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un all appeared together on a Beijing red carpet on Wednesday, it made for a powerful visual of unity against the West \u2014 but one that analysts say fell short of proving what Xi boasted was China\u2019s \u201cunstoppable\u201d rise as a global leader.",
  "content": "When Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un all appeared together on a Beijing red carpet on Wednesday, it made for a powerful visual of unity against the West \u2014 but one that analysts say fell short of proving what Xi boasted was China\u2019s \u201cunstoppable\u201d rise as a global leader.\n\nAlthough all three nations were sending a pointed rhetorical message, multiple analysts told CNN that they saw nothing to resolve a longstanding debate in the US intelligence community about whether the three should be considered a \u201cbloc\u201d acting in concert or merely three opponents of the West who work together when it suits them.\n\nThere were also no outward signs of a substantive change in defense cooperation between any of the three, something that has been closely watched by US security officials particularly after North Korea began offering its soldiers to fight on Russia\u2019s behalf in Moscow\u2019s war against Ukraine.\n\n\u201cUp until now, the so-called Axis of Upheaval has been largely bilateral,\u201d said Beth Sanner, a former senior intelligence official and CNN contributing analyst. \u201cThis was really a photo op aimed directly at the US and its Asian allies. But it papered over underlying tensions in particular between China and North Korea\u2026. I doubt this will turn into meaningful trilateral cooperation.\u201d\n\nThe three leaders appeared together, chatting genially, ahead of a massive military parade in Beijing marking the 80th anniversary of Japan\u2019s surrender in World War II, a prestige event for China attended by the leaders of 26 countries, thousands of troops and more than 50,000 spectators. President Donald Trump in a post on Truth Social accused the them of \u201cconspiring\u201d against the United States.\n\n\u201cI understood the reason they were doing it, and they were hoping I was watching \u2014 and I was watching,\u201d Trump said of the event.\n\nWhile Putin has embraced Kim for his help, China\u2019s Xi remains wary of the mercurial dictator. When the Russian defense minister visited Pyongyang to attend a military parade in 2023, it was widely seen as a formal signal from Moscow that it accepts North Korea as a nuclear state.\n\nBut Xi still \u201chasn\u2019t given the full stamp of approval,\u201d said Syd Seiler, a former senior intelligence official specializing in North Korea. \u201cI think for Xi, this stops a little short of that,\u201d he said, while still sending the message that China does accept the burgeoning relationship between Russia and North Korea and cannot be counted upon to try to help disrupt or break up that alliance.\n\nThe parade followed a regional summit in nearby Tianjin, which was headlined by a series of bilateral economic agreements between India and China. Russia and China on Tuesday also reached a framework agreement on a new natural gas pipeline to run from Russia to China. Although many details remain to be agreed upon, the memorandum still indicates China\u2019s willingness to continue flouting Western efforts to economically isolate Russia over its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe parade was nevertheless a visually impressive display of military force, analysts said. China has been in the process of growing and modernizing its military and on Wednesday, unveiled a formidable array of new weaponry, including ICBMs, a hypersonic cruise missile and drones.\n\nIt was a clear effort to demonstrate China\u2019s rise on the world stage \u2014 a rise that Ely Ratner, a former Pentagon official during the Biden administration specializing in the Indo-Pacific, said is explicitly designed to displace the United States. Sanner called it a \u201cpowerful display of China\u2019s soft and hard power\u201d that highlighted \u201cChina\u2019s vision of an alternative order with an \u2018unstoppable\u2019 China in the lead.\u201d\n\nBut Sanner and Ratner both cautioned against breathless assessments of Xi\u2019s success at casting China as a global leader.\n\n\u201cThe Japanese weren\u2019t there, the Europeans weren\u2019t there, [Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi] was there for the [Tianjin summit] but he left before the parade, which I think was no accident,\u201d Ratner said. \u201cYes, China has increasing influence among the anti-American, anti-Western coalition \u2014 but that still excludes most of the most important economics and militaries in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a more mixed picture than China is winning, and America is losing,\u201d he said.",

  "summary": "Despite a united front between Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, analysts have expressed skepticism about the unity of these leaders. The three leaders were seen as a powerful visual of unity against the West, but this fell short of proving China's rise as a global leader. There were also no signs of a significant change in defense cooperation between the three, particularly after North Korea offered soldiers to fight on Russia's behalf in Moscow's war against Ukraine. Despite this, US President Donald Trump accused the three leaders of \"conspiring\" against the United States. The military parade in Beijing marked the 80th anniversary of Japan\u2019s surrender in World War II was seen as an impressive display of military force.",

      "text": "Xi Jinping staged a staggering show of China\u2019s military power on Wednesday before some of the world\u2019s most powerful authoritarian leaders, rallying them behind his vision for a new world order as US President Donald Trump wages a global trade war and shakes up American alliances.\nFrom atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace in Beijing, Xi presided over a 70-minute parade to mark the end of World War II \u2013 flanked by a strongman waging Europe\u2019s bloodiest conflict since 1945 and an Asian leader funneling him troops and weapons.\nTo many in the West, the defining image of the spectacle is not the parade of stealth fighter jets, nuclear-capable missiles or troops marching in perfect synchrony \u2013 but the sight of Xi, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un standing side by side, in an unprecedented show of solidarity against the US and its allies.\nThey formed the defiant face of a growing bloc of illiberal leaders determined to push back against Western rules and tilt the global balance of power in their favor.\n\u201cThe Chinese nation is the great nation that is never intimidated by any bullies,\u201d Xi, China\u2019s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, told the leaders of 26 countries, thousands of troops and more than 50,000 spectators gathering in the heart of Beijing.\nAt various moments throughout the parade, Xi, Putin and Kim \u2013 who had never appeared together in public before \u2013 were seen leaning toward one another, sharing a smile and even overheard chatting about immortality and longevity on the way to Tiananmen Gate.\nThe deliberate display of unity is a pointed rebuke to Trump\u2019s faltering attempt to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine \u2013 and an open challenge to America\u2019s waning global leadership under the US president.\nThat message has seemingly been received by Trump, who wrote on Truth Social as the parade was underway: \u201cMay President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.\u201d\nPutin responded during a Wednesday news conference in Beijing, saying \u201cthe US president does not lack a sense of humor,\u201d adding that none of the world leaders who joined the summit in China \u201cexpressed negative judgments about the current US administration.\u201d\nChina\u2019s grand show of force was also designed to rally national pride and showcase Xi\u2019s tight grip on the military, even as his ongoing corruption purges have roiled the top ranks of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) and raised questions about the combat readiness of a force that hasn\u2019t fought a major war in nearly half a century.\nXi rode in an open-top black limousine to inspect troops and weapons lined up along the Avenue of Eternal Peace. \u201cComrades, you\u2019ve worked hard!\u201d Xi said from his black \u201cRed Flag\u201d limousine. \u201c(We) serve the people!\u201d the soldiers shouted back in perfect unison, saluting and watching the leader as he glided by.\nOn Chinese social media, users applauded the impressive hardware and discipline of the PLA \u2013 and drew comparisons to Trump\u2019s military parade held in Washington in June.\n\u201cChina\u2019s military parade: A showcase of national power. US military parade: A showcase of relaxation,\u201d one user wrote on Weibo.\nBrian Hart, a fellow of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Beijing\u2019s goal is to show domestic audiences and foreign watchers that despite challenges like corruption, its military is increasingly advanced and lethal.\n\u201cXi Jinping has made military modernization one of his top personal priorities, and he has been relentlessly pushing the military to improve. This parade is an opportunity to show off the PLA\u2019s advances under his leadership,\u201d he said.\nShow of force\nThe parade capped days of diplomacy and pageantry in the nearby port city of Tianjin, where Xi used a regional summit to take thinly veiled swipes at Washington and cast China as an alternative global leader.\nAt the end of a gathering of leaders from across Asia and the Middle East, Xi rolled out a new vision for how international affairs should be governed, just as Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy is upending the world.\nWednesday\u2019s massive display of force offered Xi a stage to show his guests that China not only has the ambition \u2013 but also the military power \u2013 to back up his vision.\n\u201cThe great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is unstoppable,\u201d Xi said, repeating his call for the construction of a \u201cworld-class\u201d military.\nFrom hypersonic missiles, nuclear-capable weapons to laser air defense systems, the array of sophisticated weaponry on display \u2013 much of it unveiled to the public for the first time \u2013 offered a rare glimpse into the rapid advances of China\u2019s military technology under Xi.\nIn more than a decade in power, Xi has spearheaded an ambitious modernization drive to turn the PLA into a \u201cworld-class\u201d fighting force capable of rivaling \u2013 and eventually surpassing \u2013 the US military.\nXi has shifted the PLA away from a Soviet-style, army-oriented command structure to a joint operation system modeled more closely on the US military. He has created or elevated branches to address emerging domains of warfare \u2013 including the Rocket Force, which manages China\u2019s nuclear arsenal and became a focus of Xi\u2019s corruption purges in 2023.\nMeanwhile, China has poured billions of dollars into developing weapons, many of which were featured in Wednesday\u2019s parade for the first time. It has also leveraged its industrial base to accelerate production of military hardware \u2013 including churning out enough warships to make the PLA Navy the world\u2019s largest.\nThe full day of events in Beijing also included a banquet for world leaders and concluded with a musical gala titled \u201cJustice Will Prevail.\u201d\n\u2018Axis of Upheaval\u2019\nOptics aside, analysts say there are limits to the grand display of power and unity on Tiananmen Square.\nUnlike the US, China doesn\u2019t have a formal military alliance with any country, except North Korea, and it has regularly accused NATO of seeking security at the expense of others and causing chaos around the world.\nIn addition to Putin and Kim, Xi\u2019s guests also included Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, marking the first time the four men have shown up together at one event.\nLike North Korea, Iran has sent piles of weapons to Russia to support its war on Ukraine, from drones and artillery shells to short-range missiles, according to American and European officials.\nIn the wake of Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine, strategists in Washington have warned of an emerging anti-American \u201caxis of upheaval\u201d between China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. But experts say their partnerships are primarily bilateral and there\u2019s been few signs of four-way coordination.\nJonathan Czin, an analyst at Brookings and a former CIA China expert, said the four leaders\u2019 joint attendance at the parade was \u201cdisconcerting\u201d and allowed them to present \u201ca facade of partnership.\u201d\n\u201cHowever, it is likely a symbolic high-water mark for their partnership rather than a portent of deeper quadrilateral cooperation among them, never mind a turn toward some alternative new world order,\u201d he said. \u201cNorth Korea and Iran \u2013 dangerous as they are \u2013 are the much more minor players here and have very little to no leverage.\u201d\nThat limitation was underscored this summer when the US launched air strikes on Iran, with China and Russia offering little in assistance apart from verbal condemnation of the attacks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually quite telling that the Iranian President is making this trip after that moment, since so many commentators opined that China\u2019s credibility would take a hit when it did so little to help Iran in that moment. Given Iran\u2019s lack of better options, China\u2019s forbearance does not seem to have cost it much,\u201d he said.\nCNN\u2019s Lauren Kent and Anna Chernova contributed to this report."

No substantive defense cooperation emerged, and the leaders\u2019 relationship remains largely bilateral, with limited trilateral coordination.  The event coincided with Russia\u2011China gas pipeline talks and other bilateral deals, but it does not alter the broader geopolitical balance.
