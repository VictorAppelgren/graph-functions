Don't believe what you hear out there, constantly being shoved down your throat \ud83d\ude18.\"\nHannah was featured on the hit TLC reality show, \"Jon & Kate Plus 8,\" along with her parents, older sisters, twins Mady and Cara, 24, and fellow sextuplets, Collin, Joel, Aeden, Alexis and Leah. During the second season of the show, Kate and Jon went through a public divorce, after which Kate was granted full custody of all eight children.\nIn 2018, it was revealed both Hannah and Collin had moved in with their father, but that he had little to no contact with the rest of his kids. Hannah told Teen Vogue in May that \"it's hard\" to watch episodes of their reality show and see her parents' relationship deteriorate on camera.\n\"[Filming] made my siblings and I closer to each other, even though it made my parents further from each other,\" she admitted, also acknowledging, \"It\u2019s hard to go back and watch my parents argue.\"\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING?

At the time, Kate explained on an episode of \"Kate Plus 8,\" \"I was not able, with my own resources here, to meet his needs.\"\nCollin later spoke with The Sun, in September 2024, when he accused his mother of being \"physically aggressive and verbally very abusive.\"\nAfter he made the statements, Kate's lawyer told Fox News Digital \"she never wants to comment because she always knows that this gets taken out of context. She doesn't want to comment. Doesn\u2019t need to. The record speaks for itself.\"\nHe added, \"The facts belie the truth.

After Kate and Jon split in 2009, the show was renamed \"Kate Plus 8\" and continued airing until 2017.\nIn addition to her comment about Collin's TikTok, Kate replied to several supportive messages that fans left on her post.\n\"To be honest when i was growing up, the way you were portrayed, i thought you were too harsh. as a mom of 4(6,6,3,1) now I GET IT. watching things back, you were so intelligent and organized and efficient. keep being you, kate!\" one TikTok user wrote.\n\"I was really trying to do my very best\u2026 just a bit overzealous at times,\" Kate replied. \"But only bc I cared SO SO much about my kids\nAnother fan commented, \"Looking back now, I can see how you were portrayed as the villain and you weren\u2019t. I apologize for ever thinking that.\"\n\"Aww I appreciate your words. Forgiven,\" Kate responded.\n\"I love this Kate. As we've all grown older, we now recognized how misunderstood you truly were. We hear you now,\" one follower chimed in.\n\"So true. How kind. Thank you,\" Kate wrote adding an emoji of a smiley face blowing a kiss.\nA day earlier, Collin, now 21, shared a throwback photo of himself with the other sextuplets along with Mady and Cara, now 24.\n\"Born to be a team, us against the world,\" he wrote on the image.\nHe also included a more recent photo of himself driving a car while wearing sunglasses, writing \"Forced to do it alone, and wonder every day what our lives could've looked like.\"\nCollin's post was captioned, \"Forced apart, pitted against each other. All the fame and money in the world, but what about kids being kids? I will always love them more than anything. The tears I shed behind closed doors, thinking about the memories we could\u2019ve shared. I love you guys.\"\nIn the comments section, Collin responded to fans' comments and implied that Kate was responsible for their estrangement and the divisions within their family.\n\"My twin brother and I don't speak anymore because of our own mother. Praying for you, I know exactly how you feel,\" one fan commented.\n\"I'm so sorry. It's so hard to even begin to understand why a parent would want to separate and pit their kids against each other. It literally makes no sense. I'm sorry you have to go through this\u2026\" Collin replied.\nJon and Kate rose to fame after Kate gave birth to the sextuplets after having twins using intrauterine insemination. The couple signed on to film two documentaries about their large family in order to make ends meet, but their popularity turned the Gosselins into reality TV royalty. However, the two eventually separated, then divorced, and it was all caught on camera.\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING?

Jon also doesn't have a relationship with the children outside of Collin and Hannah.\n\"At the end of the day, none of us decided to be on TV,\" Collin explained.\nIn a 2016 interview with \"Good Morning America,\" Kate denied the abuse allegations, saying they were \"absolutely\" unfounded.\n\"We didn't get the choice.

      "text": "Kate Gosselin is speaking out about her life now, which includes 12-hour days as a pediatric nurse.\n\"Today was a busy day, it was another 12-hour day, and my patient and I did a bunch of things,\" Kate told her followers on TikTok this week. \"We went on the swings together, we went to a birthday party, we played in the water, we spent a lot of time outside. My patient loves to spend time outside, and I, of course, did all of the medical care as well, feeding, bathing and all the things.\"\nShe added, \"And so now I work again tomorrow morning, so I have my dishes loaded into the dishwasher, my dishwasher running, and so I can go to bed and get up early and do it all over again,\" she continued.\nWhile several people praised her work ethic in the comments, one fan asked her what happened to all the income she earned working on the show.\nALANA 'HONEY BOO BOO' THOMPSON CLAIMS SHE'S NEVER SEEN A DIME OF MONEY MADE FROM TLC REALITY SHOW\n\"Honestly? Providing for 8 kids, college funds which I am proud to say covered all of their college and more and LAWYERS. Sickening but I was drug into court constantly and that costs A TON,\" she said in her response. \"Sad bc my kids could have a lot more saved and I could have a retirement saved if it weren\u2019t for lawyers. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m helping other families and I feel needed and I enjoy helping!\"\nThe former reality star first gained national attention when she appeared on the hit TLC reality show, \"Jon & Kate Plus 8,\" which chronicled how she and her then-husband, Jon Gosselin, managed their eight children, which included one set of twins and one set of sextuplets.\nThe show was on the air from 2007 to 2009, before the couple's divorce in 2009 brought it to an end. Kate then starred in the show's spin-off, \"Kate Plus 8,\" which showed what her life was like as a single mother.\nOne fan in the comments section pointed out that the life she lives now seems much different than what her life was like on the show, and asked if she misses anything from her time on the show.\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\"I miss our house in Pa. But mainly, I miss when the kids were little. Not the stress, just their cuteness. At the time it felt like the days were long\u2026but in hindsight it sped by. And I\u2019m sad :(,\" she wrote in her response.\nAt the time their divorce was finalized, Kate was awarded sole physical custody of all eight of the couple's children. It was later revealed that one of the sextuplets, Hannah, lived with Jon, but that he had little to no contact with his other children.\nIn 2018, Jon was awarded temporary custody of another one of the sextuplets, Collin, after he was allegedly diagnosed with a behavioral disorder and sent away by Kate to a separate school at the age of 12. She sent him to live at the Fairmount Behavioral Health System, a psychiatric hospital located in Philadelphia.\nIn September 2024, Collin accused his mother of being \"physically aggressive and verbally very abusive,\" during an interview with The Sun.\n\"My mother had a room built in our unfinished section of the storage basement,\" he said. \"She had a room put up with cameras in it, a tiny window in the corner and it was bolt-locked from the outside. It was like a containment room, and it had a mattress on the floor and that's how I lived.\"\nFollowing the interview, Kate's lawyer, Richard Puelo, told Fox News Digital, \"She never wants to comment because she always knows that this gets taken out of context. She doesn't want to comment. Doesn\u2019t need to. The record speaks for itself.\"\nHe added, \"The facts belie the truth. Whatever took place, the ones that are truthful are the ones that took place\u2026 She has no comment because it\u2019s not going to change the past. And I don\u2019t believe she intentionally harmed any of her children in any way, shape or form.\"\nMore recently, Collin shared an old family photo on TikTok featuring him and his siblings, writing an emotional caption about their fractured relationship, stating \"Born to be a team, us against the world. Forced to do it alone, and wonder every day what our lives could've looked like.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\"Forced apart, pitted against each other. All the fame and money in the world, but what about kids being kids?\" he wrote. \"I will always love them more than anything. The tears I shed behind closed doors, thinking about the memories we could\u2019ve shared. I love you guys.\""

      "text": "Kate Gosselin is getting real about what life has been like following fame, which included unhealthy coping mechanisms to manage empty nest syndrome.\nIn a recent TikTok video, the former reality television star discussed her initial feelings when her oldest kids, twins Mady and Cara, 24, went off to college.\nGosselin admitted that she pretended her daughters were just upstairs sleeping and not away at school.\n\"I couldn't accept the fact that they left, they were gone at college and I wasn't going to see them until the holidays. So, I unhealthily coped and that's how I dealt with it,\" Gosselin said while sewing a button on her son, Joel's, suit.\nKATE GOSSELIN SHUTS DOWN RUMORS SHE'S NOT IN TOUCH WITH DAUGHTER HANNAH\nShe continued to say that in the first weeks her daughters were away, the three of them would sit and cry on FaceTime together. \"After that, they found friends and I didn't hear from them as much, which scared me,\" Gosselin said.\nKate explained that she was afraid for her daughters' safety, and it wasn't until she was speaking to a friend who had already sent her kids to college that she began to let go of the reins and accept that Mady and Cara were OK.\n\"By the time the little kids went to college \u2013 they go to college closer to home, which is nice \u2013 it was a little easier because they could come home on the weekends. It didn't feel so final, I guess is what I'm trying to say,\" Gosselin said. Kate is mom to 21-year-old sextuplets Joel, Aeden, Alexis, Leah, Hannah and Collin, whom she is estranged from.\nGosselin said by the time the sextuplets were off, she had already had a \"trial run\" of her kids leaving home with Mady and Cara. The \"Kate Plus 8\" star said her favorite time is around the holidays, when all her kids are home and her home is loud.\n\"In all of this \u2018empty nest\u2019 stuff, don't forget what our goal is. As a parent, it's to prepare our kids to be functional, productive members of society. So, when they go to college, it's a good thing and they're growing up. It's the next step and they still need us, but not as much, and that's OK,\" Gosselin said.\nKate concluded by welcoming followers to ask her any questions while wrapping up sewing Joel's button on his suit so he could take it with him to college.\nEarlier last week, Gosselin uploaded another TikTok video admitting that her life looks a lot different from her hit TLC reality show, \"Jon & Kate Plus 8\" days.\nShe is currently a pediatric nurse working 12-hour shifts.\n\"Today was a busy day, it was another 12-hour day, and my patient and I did a bunch of things. We went on the swings together, we went to a birthday party, we played in the water, we spent a lot of time outside.
