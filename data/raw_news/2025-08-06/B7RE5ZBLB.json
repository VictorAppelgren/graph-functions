  "title": "At UK\u00a38.74, Is It Time To Put Young & Co.'s Brewery, P.L.C. (LON:YNGA) On Your Watch List?",
  "description": "AIM:YNGA 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore Young's Brewery's Fair Values from the Community and select yours...",
  "content": "Explore Young's Brewery's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\n\n\nYoung & Co.'s Brewery, P.L.C. (LON:YNGA), is not the largest company out there, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the AIM over the last few months, increasing to UK\u00a39.92 at one point, and dropping to the lows of UK\u00a38.59. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Young's Brewery's current trading price of UK\u00a38.74 reflective of the actual value of the small-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Young's Brewery\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nAccording to our valuation model, Young's Brewery seems to be fairly priced at around 12% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Young's Brewery today, you\u2019d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth \u00a39.89, then there isn\u2019t much room for the share price grow beyond what it\u2019s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Young's Brewery\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Young's Brewery\n\nWhat kind of growth will Young's Brewery generate?\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Young's Brewery's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? YNGA\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?",
