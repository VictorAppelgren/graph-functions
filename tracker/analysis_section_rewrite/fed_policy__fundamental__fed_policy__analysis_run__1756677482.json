      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Canonical Handle Mapping** – The draft currently references “10‑year Treasury yield” and “mortgage rates” but never links them to the required canonical handles.  \n   *Add inline citations that map the 10‑year Treasury to `ust10y` and mortgage rates to `mortgage_rate` (or, if mortgage rates are not a canonical handle, map to the nearest proxy such as `ust10y` or `cdx_hy`).*  \n\n2. **Catalyst Window & Magnitude** – The analysis mentions September 2024 Fed cuts and QT but does not specify a concrete catalyst window or magnitude range.  \n   *Insert a clear catalyst window (e.g., “Sept 16 2024 – Dec 31 2025”) and quantify the impact: 10‑year yield rose 200 bp, mortgage rates rose 300 bp, term premium expanded by ~150 bp.”*  \n\n3. **Causal Chain Clarity** – The paragraph is dense and mixes multiple mechanisms (real‑rate differential, term premium, liquidity).  \n   *Re‑order the chain: (i) Fed cuts → (ii) QT removes $2 T of demand → (iii) liquidity squeeze → (iv) term premium ↑ → (v) 10‑year yield ↑ → (vi) mortgage rates ↑.”*  \n\n4. **Remove Generic/Redundant Sentences** – Sentences such as “The base case for the 10‑year yield over the next multi‑year horizon is a gradual normalization…” are too verbose.  \n   *Condense to a single line: “Expect ust10y to settle at 4.3–4.4 % by 2027 if inflation remains anchored.”*  \n\n5. **Add Explicit Risk & Watchlist** – The draft lists risks but lacks specific watch signals.  \n   *Add bullet‑style watch list: (a) QT pace > 200 bn/month → yield > 4.6 %; (b) CPI/PCE > 3 % → real‑rate differential widens; (c) FedWatch probability of a cut > 70 % → temporary yield dip.”*  \n\n6. **Citation Density & Accuracy** – Ensure every substantive claim has an inline ID.  \n   *Add citations after each numeric claim (e.g., “yield rose 200 bp (HYJA10SKI)”, “mortgage rates at 6.55 % (LF0UUL917)”).*  \n\n7. **Format & Length** – The paragraph should be ≤ 200 words, concise, and action‑oriented.  \n   *Rewrite the draft into a single, tightly‑structured paragraph following the above edits.*  \n\nImplement these changes to meet the acceptance gate: ≥1 canonical handle with sign/magnitude, ≥1 dated catalyst window, and a clear, defensible causal path.",
