  "title": "This sweet plant compound could protect your teeth by blocking bacteria",
  "description": "Scientists believe a surprising plant extract could be harnessed in dental products.",
  "content": "Scientists may have identified a sweet solution to tooth decay in the form of a natural compound that can combat bacteria. While studying food borne pathogens, they noticed that listeria appeared to easily form layers of bacteria on most wood \u2014 but avoided maple. The researchers isolated compounds called polyphenols from the plant and tested them against a type of bacteria, Streptococcus mutans. Study author Dr Mark Gomelsky, an expert in microbiology at the University of Wyoming in the US, said: \u201cSince S.mutans initiates cavities by forming biofilms (plaques) on teeth and producing acid that destroys tooth enamel, we asked: could maple polyphenols also inhibit S.mutans biofilms?\u201d\n\nLab tests showed that maple polyphenols were able to block the bacteria from forming biofilms on plastic teeth. Dr Gomelsky added: \u201cEverything fell into place just as we predicted. That\u2019s a rare experience in science, and probably the first time it\u2019s happened in my 35-year research career. \u201cWe discovered that several polyphenols present in maple wood or maple sap can inhibit the sortase enzyme in S. mutans, which in turn prevents this cavity-causing bacterium from attaching to tooth surfaces.\u201d They also prevented bacteria growth on a material that mimics tooth enamel. The team now hopes the maple compounds could be used in dental products to prevent cavities.\n\nSuch products could be safer than those which rely on killing bacteria, including mouthwash, which can be dangerous if swallowed by young children, they said. Almost a quarter of five-year-olds in England had \u201cvisually obvious tooth decay\u201d in the 2021-2022 school year, official figures show. The findings were published in Microbiology Spectrum, a journal of the American Society for Microbiology.\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
