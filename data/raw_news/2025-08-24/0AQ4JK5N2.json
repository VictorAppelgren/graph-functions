  "description": "After meeting separately with President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Voldymyr Zelenskiy could be headed toward a pivotal face-to-face summit. President Trump is urging both leaders to show some \"flexibility\". Julia Roknifard, Senior Lecturer at the School of Law & Governance at Taylor's University Malaysia told Bloomberg\u2019s Chief Africa Correspondent Jennifer Zabasajja on Horizons Middle East and Africa on the push for Trump to get a deal not just in Ukraine but also in Gaza. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "I want to just start here because just a few days ago, on Friday, after the Alaska summit, we heard from analysts saying that Putin had scored a win. And I wonder if we take a look at the events over the past few days this week. Has that been undone? Are you seeing some progress towards potential peace in this meeting between Putin and Zelensky? That's right. Putin indeed has square to win, as they say, after this Alaskan meeting. I don't think it has been undone by the meeting between Donald Trump, Vladimir Zelensky, and the European leaders supporting Ukraine. Yes, there is probably space or reason for concern for Vladimir Putin with what was decided during that meeting. But even in the middle of the meeting, Donald Trump was calling Vladimir Putin to update him on what's going on. So clearly, it looks like Moscow has got an upper hand in the conflict. It's got Putin has gotten Trump to practically repeat his own words about that. There's not going to be a temporary cease fire until there is a whole deal, a wholesale deal reached. So Trump has been repeating it word by word, and I don't see that changing. So now it comes to Donald Trump possibly rendering pressure on Vladimir Zelensky and the European leaders in trying to reach some sort of the deal. But if Putin is unhappy with what comes out of there, then Russia is simply going to keep fighting, because, as I said, it's got an upper hand and it has been like this in the battlefield. Now, we can say in diplomacy as well, because of his latest travel to Alaska, what are the obstacles to getting this meeting between Putin and Zelenskiy to happen? There needs to be a preparation done. The meeting between Putin and Trump was quite hastily planned and it looks like Trump and did walked into it without proper preparation. So there were contours of something discussed and I presume there were issues discussed beyond Ukraine, but which also plays into Russia's gait in terms of trying to water down the issue of Ukraine with a broader sort of context of cooperation between Russia and the United States. So now, indeed, there needs to be a preparation taking place where they can align positions of the sides because it's not going to happen that Putin and Zelensky walk into one room and they sign something or they talk it over and they agree over over something to sign it first. There needs to be a deal. Deal needs to be line on the table, which the parties agreed to, and then they're going to walk in and sign. And in those conditions, I think Vladimir Putin would be okay to even sit in one room with Vladimir Zelensky, which he was not very willing to do, as we've seen throughout negotiations. And on that, it's quite unclear if they are going to reach even if these preparations that they talked about are done. If they are going to reach some sort of the deal, even if the land swap, for example, is not on the table, there are other arrangements because the problem still remains with Ukraine agreeing to join NATO's to to give up its bid for joining NATO's European Union. And Russia is to insist on the security guarantees which the United States proposed to do to become such a guarantor. But it's not clear if Ukraine is at the point that it's ready to accept or negotiate on something that Vladimir Putin would accept as well. Right. And Julia, you believe I want to turn to the Middle East because you believe actually what we're seeing in the Middle East when it comes to Israel and Trump's relations with Israel can be put similarly to how we're seeing the Trump administration dealing with another geopolitical crisis with Ukraine and Russia. Can you talk about where you see the overlaps? The overlap in my mind is that Trump It was a part of Trump's promises during his election campaign to end up all the worse and move on to the issues of more importance, probably making America great again to to the domestic issues. So he is quite impassioned to end those conflicts both in Ukraine and in the Middle East, to to to have some sort of settlement. Of course not with Israel losing in the Middle East, but nevertheless to to to put a cap on that fire. The conflict that is happening now around Palestine. And the overlap is also that he was unable to do that because he promised to end the war in the Ukraine within 24 hours. That didn't happen. So now he wants that win desperately to be able to declare that he either got the win, he put an end to both conflicts, or at least he's done everything he could for that. And it wasn't up to him. It was up to Vladimir Zelensky, Vladimir Putin, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Palestinian administration and whatever. Also, the overlap here might be in the sense that Netanyahu also is inflexible in the sense that there is a deal on the table once again on the cease fire, as we know. Right. And Hamas as of lately agreed to the deal. But there is no indication that Israel is going to agree to the deal because Netanyahu administration, I guess, prefers to keep fighting until the victorious end, rather, have a ceasefire, have again half of the hostages released and then after a while they will have to renew that. So for Netanyahu, kind of the way it is for Vladimir Putin here is it's everything or nothing either. We are getting it all the some kind of and settlements, which probably would also imply expelling people from Gaza elsewhere. That's what's being negotiated with other countries. So far, I don't see anybody accepting that or we we will simply keep fighting. And I don't think hostages in this situation matter that much to Netanyahu administration and his minority government.",

  "summary": "The article discusses the recent events surrounding the meeting between Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky, suggesting that progress towards potential peace has been made after the Alaska summit. However, Roknifard argues that this has not been achieved, despite analysts suggesting that Putin had already achieved a win. He argues that even during the meeting, Donald Trump was constantly updating Vladimir Putin on the situation. He also notes that if Putin is unhappy with what comes out of the meeting he will continue fighting, Russia will keep fighting. The author suggests that a preparation for the meeting needs to be done to align positions of the sides and that a deal needs to occur. They also suggest that if they reach some sort of deal, there are other arrangements. The article also mentions that there are similarities between Israel and the US administration's approach to ending conflicts in both the Middle East and Israel, and that the conflict around Palestine is also overlapping.",

  "argos_summary": "The interview discusses how analysts saw Putin as having won at the Alaska summit, but the subsequent meeting with Trump, Zelensky, and European leaders did not reverse that advantage. Trump\u2019s brief call with Putin and the hastily arranged talks highlight a lack of preparation and a need for a concrete deal before any ceasefire or agreement can be reached. The conversation also draws parallels to the Middle East, noting that Netanyahu\u2019s inflexibility mirrors Putin\u2019s all\u2011or\u2011nothing stance, and that both conflicts remain unresolved because key parties are unwilling to compromise. Overall, the piece underscores that without a negotiated framework, Russia will continue fighting and the Ukraine and Israel conflicts will persist.",
