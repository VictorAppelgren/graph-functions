  "title": "The Ending of 'Weapons' Is Very Personal to Zach Cregger",
  "description": "The writer and director of the horror hit goes deep on some of the film's more disturbing choices.",
  "content": "You can\u2019t watch a movie like Weapons and not sense that parts of it come from deep within a person. The portrayals of family, fear, and loss\u2014it\u2019s all heartbreaking and scary even before you get to the chills and thrills. Writer-director Zach Cregger fully admits the film was written as a way for him to cope with the loss of a good friend, but his personal connections to the material go even beyond that.\n\nSpeaking to Vanity Fair, Cregger talked about some of the big reveals in the final act of the film and how they were inspired by his own upbringing. Spoilers to follow.\n\nIn the film, we learn that the sole survivor of the classroom disappearance, Alex (Cary Christopher), is secretly taking care of his parents, who have been possessed by the magic of his aunt Gladys (Amy Madigan). Alex has to cook, clean, and feed his parents, who sit there completely helpless, all as a way to make sure they are keeping up the appearance of something normal. \u201cThis is more of a diary entry about me,\u201d Cregger said about the scenario. \u201cThe last chapter of this movie is straight-up autobiographical. That was my childhood. You live with an alcoholic parent, and there\u2019s this inversion of the dynamic. The child can become the [caregiver].\u201d\n\nOf course, in Weapons, Alex\u2019s parents aren\u2019t alcoholics. Cregger decided to make that parallel a little less obvious by making the influence on Alex\u2019s parents supernatural. Nevertheless, it\u2019s meant to evoke the same feelings. \u201cThis foreign substance comes in and it changes everyone\u2019s behavior,\u201d Cregger said. \u201cThe house becomes a scary place. You can go to school and act like everything\u2019s cool, and then you come home and you hide from a zombie parent. That felt so real to me.\u201d\n\nKnowing Cregger created this scenario as a bit of a way to work through his childhood struggles adds even more catharsis to Alex\u2019s eventual triumph over Gladys and the return of his parents. And yet, as per the final line of the movie, not all the children recover from the trauma. Which feels both sad and realistic.\n\nWeapons is now in theaters. Read more from Cregger about the making of the film here and here. And head over to Vanity Fair to read more about the ending, including the look and history of Gladys.",

      "text": "At a Glance:\nDoctor Who ended the eras of both Chris Chibnall as series showrunner and Jodie Whittaker as the 13th Doctor in 2022 with \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d bringing to a close a three-season, three-special run.\nWhittaker\u2019s replacement is returning star David Tennant. He will play the official 14th incarnation of the Doctor under returning showrunner Russell T. Davies, who revived Doctor Who in 2005 and managed the series until 2009.\nTennant will appear in three specials in November 2023 to coincide with the 60th anniversary of Doctor Who on November 23.\nHe\u2019ll be joined by returning characters Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, who were played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins in season four of Doctor Who. Neil Patrick Harris will play a new villain, while Heartstopper\u2019s Yasmin Finney will play a character named Rose.\nTennant will be succeeded by Sex Education\u2019s Ncuti Gatwa as the 15th Doctor. His announcement in May 2022 makes him the first Black male actor to play the character on-screen.\nGatwa will star in Doctor Who\u2019s 14th season, set to air some time in 2024.\nMillie Gibson will co-star as the 15th Doctor\u2019s companion.\nGame of Thrones star Indira Varma will play a mysterious character known as \u201cthe Duchess.\u201d\nDoctor Who\u2019s beloved tradition of doing a Christmas Special\u2014no more New Year\u2019s Day Specials, in other words\u2014will return in 2023, with another confirmed for 2024.\nComedian Sooz Kempner will star in Doom\u2019s Day, a new transmedia Doctor Who campaign tied into the anniversary. She\u2019ll play Doom, the titular intergalactic assassin, who has found herself hunted by Death itself\u2014and must use a purloined vortex manipulator with a day\u2019s worth of time-jumping charge to find the Doctor and save herself.\nThis post was last updated 5/30/23.\nWhat\u2019s Been Going on in Doctor Who?\nThree Doctor Who specials aired out the last days of Jodie Whittaker\u2019s time as the Doctor in 2022. \u201cEve of the Daleks\u201d saw the Doctor and her companions Dan (introduced in the prior 13th season, known as Doctor Who: Flux) and Yaz facing the titular iconic monsters in a time loop paradox. \u201cLegend of the Sea Devils\u201d revived the classic \u201870s monsters for a new adventure, while \u201cPower of the Doctor\u201d saw the 13th Doctor face off against the Master in an adventure that ultimately saw her mortally wounded, returning her companions to contemporary Earth while she regenerated into a new body.\nWhy Is David Tennant the Doctor Again? Is David Tennant Playing the 10th Doctor?\nWhittaker regenerated not into previously announced new Doctor Ncuti Gatwa, but David Tennant, who played the official 10th incarnation of the Time Lord from Christmas 2005 to New Year\u2019s Day 2010, before reprising the role for Doctor Who\u2019s 50th anniversary special, \u201cThe Day of the Doctor,\u201d in 2013.\nWhile this marks his first return on-screen in the series since then, Tennant will not be playing the 10th Doctor, but the official 14th incarnation\u2014and the character will be aware that they are both using a familiar form and are a new entity. Aside from the fact that Tennant is arguably the most popular actor to take on the role, so bringing him back for the 60th anniversary makes sense, there\u2019s plenty of reasons Doctor Who can come up with as to why the Doctor\u2019s regenerative process decided to re-use an old identity, more of which you can read about here.\nWhen Will Doctor Who Return in 2023?\nDoctor Who will return for three special episodes in November 2023, set to air in celebration of the series\u2019 60th anniversary.\nWhat Is Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary Special About?\nAside from Tennant returning as the Doctor, he\u2019ll be joined by former companions Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins (the actor\u2019s last role prior to his passing in July 2022) in Doctor Who\u2019s fourth season. Donna exited the series as a regular character after an adventure lead to her needing to have her memory wiped by the 10th Doctor, forgetting her time alongside him lest her mind face grievous harm, so just how Donna will play into the the story remains to be seen.\nThe Doctor and Donna will face a mysterious new adversary, played by Neil Patrick Harris, and will be joined in the specials by Yasmin Finney as a new character named Rose. How Finney\u2019s Rose might connect to the other famous Rose of Doctor Who, Billie Piper\u2019s Rose Tyler, also remains to be seen.\nIs There a Trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary?\nThe first premiered at the end of \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d and you can watch it above. The second premiered in December and you can watch it here:\nWhen Will Ncuti Gatwa Become the Doctor?\nGatwa is briefly seen in the trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th anniversary, so will presumably follow the long tradition of new Doctors appearing in the final moments of their predecessor\u2019s last episodes to become the 15th Doctor. The BBC has announced that Gatwa will appear as the Doctor first \u201cover the festive season\u201d in 2023, before he takes over full-time in a new season of the show after that.\nIs There a Doctor Who Season 14 Release Date?\nThere\u2019s no current release date for season 14 of Doctor Who, but it is expected to be broadcast some time in 2024.\nWhere Is Doctor Who Streaming in the U.S. and UK?\nCurrently, the first 13 seasons of the revived Doctor Who are streaming on the BBC iPlayer in the UK; in the U.S., the revived series streams exclusively on HBO Max. In both countries, episodes from the classic era of the show are available through Britbox.\nThis will change in 2023, at least in the U.S. The BBC and Disney have announced that as part of a new deal, Doctor Who will stream exclusively worldwide on Disney+, except for in the UK and Ireland, where it will still stream on the BBC iPlayer and BBC One. It\u2019s currently unknown if this will affect Doctor Who\u2019s place on BBC America, where it currently airs in the U.S..\nDoes Disney Co-Own Doctor Who Now?\nA report in the wake of the BBC/Disney announcement from British paper the Telegraph alleged that the deal will also see Disney contribute finances to help create the show, and while the series\u2019 creative team will still hold control of the series primarily, the deal will allow Disney some level of say in the creative decisions for the series\u2014as well as allowing access to talent or \u201ccinematic production moments\u201d previously inaccessible due to the BBC\u2019s budget for the show.\nNone of this has been confirmed by the BBC, however. The announcement strictly focused on Disney\u2019s acquisition of Doctor Who\u2019s streaming rights, and did not mention any co-owning. The new era of the series will be made for the BBC by Bad Wolf Studios, created by former Doctor Who producer Julie Gardner and former BBC Controller of Fiction Jane Tranter\u2014which is now owned by Sony Pictures Television, after the studio took a majority stake in Bad Wolf in December 2021. The series was previously made by BBC Studios directly.\nIn January, Davies did say that Doctor Who is now working with a bigger budget, telling GQ that Disney\u2019s involvement came about as part of \u201cthe BBC\u2019s notion to go for a streamer to invest in the show worldwide \u2026 We\u2019re not on the budget level with Star Wars and the Marvel shows, [but] it\u2019s better than it was \u2026 We\u2019re not allowed to talk about budget\u2026 but it\u2019s more than I\u2019ve ever had to work with.\u201d\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Writing and directing a breakout hit can be both a blessing and a curse for some filmmakers. On the one hand, you\u2019ve just achieved your dreams of success and adoration in the world of cinema. Well done. On the other hand, now you have to do it again. And again. And again. Some filmmakers fail at this. Others, especially the great ones, rise to the challenge. George Lucas followed THX 1138 with American Graffiti and Star Wars. Steven Spielberg followed Duel with Sugarland Express and Jaws. Fast forward a few decades, and Quentin Tarantino followed Reservoir Dogs with Pulp Fiction, Wes Anderson followed Bottle Rocket with Rushmore, and Paul Thomas Anderson followed Hard Eight with Boogie Nights, just to name a few. It\u2019s not an exact science, but usually the real measure of a filmmaker is not that first movie; it\u2019s the one (or two) that follows.\nZach Cregger made his mark with the 2022 film Barbarian. The shocking horror ride made it clear he was a force to be reckoned with, and when his next film was ready to go, several major studios wanted it. That movie, called Weapons, shows what happens to a town when a group of children mysteriously vanish. It releases next week, and as we\u2019ve already written about on this site, it\u2019s fantastic. A level up on par with those aforementioned filmmakers, to be sure.\nRecently, io9 spoke with Cregger about the pressure to follow up Barbarian. We talked about putting together this much more complex, layered movie and his writing and directing process, as well as a tease of what to expect from his third movie, a new take on Resident Evil. Read all about it below.\nGermain Lussier, io9. After Barbarian, I know you said you wanted to go bigger, but did you feel pressure to deliver something equally horrific and surprising again? And were you worried that by doing that the audience might kind of become to expect the same type of thing from you?\nZach Cregger: Um, no. I don\u2019t really think that way. I just kind of wanted to write a story that was on the story\u2019s terms. If I\u2019m thinking result-oriented or what are people gonna think, then I\u2019m doomed. That\u2019s not the right way to be creative. The right way to be creative is to just do it for fun and just do it because you love to do it. To write it because you love to write. So I was able to kind of seal out that sort of result-based thinking.\nio9: I read in the press notes that you kind of just sat down after the death of your friend and just wrote this movie. But it\u2019s a pretty complicated movie. So once you had the rough idea, how\u2019d you kind of settle on this structure, when to reveal what, and all the intricacies?\nCregger: Yeah. So look, I sat down, and I kind of puked out a first draft. There are like 70 pages of just emotion on there. And the structure was the structure. So I had the structure in place, but it didn\u2019t really work. It definitely didn\u2019t connect right, and certain things were absolutely broken. And so then I got my 70 pages; it\u2019s time to actually roll up my sleeves and use my brain and fix it. So the first pass is definitely like a really subconscious kind of transcendental state. And then the second pass is like, \u2018Okay, time to get brainy here and make it function.\u2019 And that was like a three-week [process]. I went to my manager\u2019s house in the woods on the East Coast, and I didn\u2019t do anything for three weeks. All I did all day was just work on it. And I got it in shape.\nio9: You also mentioned in the press notes that when you sat down to write the script, you had the idea of the missing kids but didn\u2019t know the why of it yet.\nCregger: Right.\nio9: That\u2019s obviously the whole point of the movie, and we\u2019re not going to spoil it, but I\u2019m curious, what was the process of figuring it out? Did you get to the point in the script and you\u2019re like, \u201cNow I need to have this answer?\u201d Did you make a list? Was the process of settling on what you were going to do?\nCregger: No, I hadn\u2019t gotten to that moment of truth yet. I hadn\u2019t hit that point of no return. So I was kind of just like hoping it was going to come to me, and it did. Like, about 50 pages in, I got the answer, and it was a really joyful moment. I was like, \u2018This will work. Like this is a satisfying reason.\u2019 And, and then I was able to kind of like bend the story toward that. So yeah, it worked.\nio9: By the end of the movie, it\u2019s very clear why it\u2019s called Weapons, but I\u2019m wondering, were there ever any other titles, and when did you come up with Weapons as the title?\nCregger: I don\u2019t remember when. I might\u2019ve come up with Weapons when I started writing. It\u2019s very possible. I think it was like always there, but I\u2019m not sure. I should go on my computer and see if there are earlier documents that have a different title. I doubt it, though. You know, it just felt right. It was just one of those things. I really try not to think about anything when I\u2019m writing. I don\u2019t want to intellectualize anything. So it\u2019s just kind of like, \u201cBleh, that\u2019s it.\u201d\nio9: Similar to Barbarian, there are a lot of surprises in this movie. How involved are you with the marketing to say, \u201cWe can show this, we can\u2019t show that?\u201d Because as a young filmmaker, usually you wouldn\u2019t have a lot of say in that, but this seems like it\u2019s got your fingerprints on it a little bit.\nCregger: Yeah, [Warner Bros.] was definitely very collaborative, and they were interested in keeping the mystery intact. And so there was never any roll up your sleeves and duke it out things. There were a couple of moments where they showed me cuts. I was like, \u201cCan we lose that shot and that shot?\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cNo problem.\u201d So they\u2019re wonderful. And I think they did an amazing job.\nio9: Next up you\u2019re making Resident Evil. And after doing two movies that you conceived of yourself, was there any trepidation about doing not just a movie that\u2019s a major IP, but one that has so many other movies and games and stories that fans are used to?\nCregger: Yeah. I mean, you, you have to respect the IP, and you have to take it seriously. I\u2019m a natural, huge fan of the games. I\u2019ve played them all. I love them deeply. So I feel like I know how to tell a story in that world. It\u2019s an original story. I\u2019m not telling a story that\u2019s been told in the games, but it\u2019s a story that lives in the world of the games and obeys the rules. And so, look, as long as you\u2019re telling a really good story, then I think you\u2019re going to be okay. I\u2019m not breaking the rules. I don\u2019t think people are going to come crucify me for this.\nio9: Since it\u2019s in the trailer, I feel safe asking about this, but the eyes. Those unblinking eyes. Those bloodshot eyes. How did you go about doing that practically? Or was it\u2026\nCregger: It was VFX. We researched Graves\u2019 disease. And so we had a lot of reference material from that. And then, you know, it was an iterative process in post of like, how big is too big? And you want that thing where it looks wrong, but it\u2019s not immediately obvious. And so yeah, we dialed it in slowly. It\u2019s pretty wild.\nio9: This is a horror movie for sure, but it\u2019s got detective stuff, family drama, and mystery too. How did this mishmash of genres come to be, or was that sort of a result of you just kind of like throwing this whole story out there?\nCregger: It was that. This is just kind of what came [out], you know? I knew I had all these different characters that were all going to kind of dive headlong into this mystery, but all from different places. So you got a cop; you\u2019re going to get a cop way in. You\u2019ve got a drug addict, you\u2019re going to get this like seedy way in, and you\u2019ve got the teacher, and she\u2019s going to get preyed upon. So I was able to kind of do like five different horror movies, or seven, as it were, in one. It was really fun.\nio9: We\u2019re at a place now where this movie is coming out, and I think it\u2019s going to be a real big hit, but it\u2019s been a great summer for horror overall. Horror has really seen a resurgence in the last couple of years. Do you feel like you\u2019re carrying the torch at all, now having two movies as part of that? Do you feel like an ambassador in any way?\nCregger: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think that way, of like, my place in the broader framework of horror. I\u2019m more than happy that there seem to be people excited to see the movie, and that\u2019s enough for me.\nio9: The movie allows us to see scenes from multiple points of view. How\u2019d you go about that? Did you shoot them all at the same time?\nCregger: You got to shoot it all together because of the limitations of time and money, and it\u2019s such a big machine making a movie. So it\u2019s like when you\u2019re at the gas station, you\u2019re going to shoot all the gas station stuff. I\u2019m not coming back to the gas station for that person\u2019s chapter. We\u2019re going to do it all together. And it\u2019s confusing, but if you\u2019re really organized and you\u2019ve shot it out, like you storyboarded it and you have a plan, it\u2019s not so bad.\nio9: And my last thing here is when the movie was first announced, Pedro Pascal was playing the Josh Brolin role. Ultimately he had to leave, and now it\u2019s Josh Brolin. How would the movie have been different with Pedro than with Josh, and why was Josh ultimately the right person for it?\nCregger: I have no idea because I didn\u2019t make the movie with Pedro. I can\u2019t really answer that. I can just only say that I adore Josh\u2019s performance in this movie, and I\u2019m so glad he\u2019s in it. He\u2019s amazing.\nWeapons is amazing too. Check it out on August 8, and come back next week for more from Cregger about a few spoilers in the film.\nWant more io9 news?

But now that the film is in theaters, we can talk about them, and in terms of arguably the biggest reveal, writer-director Zack Cregger spoke to us about the different ways he approached it.\nWe\u2019re about to dive into some of Weapons\u2019 biggest spoilers, so if you haven\u2019t seen it yet, be aware.\nOne of Weapons\u2019 biggest reveals comes right at the beginning. All the marketing said that every member of Ms. Gandy\u2019s (Julia Garner) class disappeared, but that\u2019s not true. One boy named Alex (Cary Christopher) remained. And, as the film moves along, we learn Alex is the key to all of this. Alex and, more specifically, his family.\nA character who didn\u2019t appear before release at all is Gladys, Alex\u2019s aunt, played by Amy Madigan (Field of Dreams). With each creepy, clown-like appearance, we become increasingly terrified of Gladys until finally, in the chapter dedicated to school principal Marcus (Benedict Wong), all is revealed. Gladys is behind the disappearance of the children because she\u2019s an evil witch with an ability to bend people to her will. She uses her magic to not just turn Andrew into a killing machine, but several others, including the kids who disappear.\nBut to what end? We know Gladys\u2019 goal is to extend her life, something she\u2019s already been doing for an inhuman amount of time. But how exactly that fits in with kidnapping the kids in Alex\u2019s class is never clear. Is she sucking their energy? Does just possessing them help her? We don\u2019t know. We also don\u2019t know where she sees all of this going. Did she just expect to get away with torturing this family and town forever? Plus, there\u2019s no hint at all to any of her history. Where did she learn her witchcraft? How long has she been doing it? Are there other witches out there? It\u2019s all left intentionally mysterious, though; that wasn\u2019t always the case.\n\u201cIn an earlier draft of the script I had given her her own chapter,\u201d Cregger told io9 of his decision to keep Gladys\u2019 goals a mystery. \u201cIt was a little bit of an origin before she came to town. But I realized that it was just giving too much away. It\u2019s more compelling to not know some of these things. So I ended up cutting it very early on in the writing process.\u201d\nOne place some of that does exist, however, is just in Cregger\u2019s head, and he did decide to talk to his actor about it. \u201cFor [Gladys], I kind of had an idea of what was going on with her,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I talked with Amy [Madigan] about that somewhat, but I also want to respect Amy\u2019s process. And I want her to take ownership, and I want her to kind of create her own mythology. So I gave her a couple of options of what I think might be going on. And then I kind of didn\u2019t ask her too many questions about where she landed with it.\u201d\nSo while Weapons completely satisfies in answering how the class of kids disappears, that answer just creates more questions. Questions that the film, and filmmaker, did answer\u2014but decided to leave out of the movie.\nFor more from Cregger on Weapons, read the rest of our interview here. Weapons is now in theaters.\nCorrection: The original version of this article had the wrong name for Benedict Wong\u2019s character. That\u2019s been changed.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "\u201cStar Wars! Nothing but Star Wars! Give me those Star Wars! Don\u2019t let them end\u2026\u201d Just as Bill Murray said it in 1978, we\u2019re still saying it today. Star Wars is everywhere these days, with multiple movies and TV shows in the works from Disney and Lucasfilm. This article will give you the most up-to-date Star Wars release dates so you know exactly when every new Star Wars movie or Disney+ show will arrive.\nWhat are the next three movies? What TV shows are coming up? Have any TV shows or movies been canceled? What are people saying about what\u2019s next? We\u2019ve got you covered on all things in a galaxy far, far away.\nThis post was last updated on 9/13/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next Star Wars movie?\nSharmeen Obaid-Chioy\u2019s New Jedi Order Film Film\nRelease Date: TBD, but May 26, 2026, December 18, 2026 or December 17, 2027 (In Theaters)\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023 in London, Lucasfilm announced that three Star Wars movies are now in the works.\nJames Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) will direct a film 25,000 years before any known Star Wars timeline about the first Jedi to use the Force.\nDave Filoni will direct a film that\u2019s kind of the Star Wars Disney+ Avengers, telling the story of a climactic event meeting the stories of The Book of Boba Fett, The Mandalorian, Ahsoka and more in the time between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens.\nAnd Sharmeen Obaid-Chioy will direct a film set 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker following Rey (Daisy Ridley) as she creates a New Jedi Order.\nThis last one, we think, is the film that Damon Lindelof (Lost, The Leftovers, Watchmen) was co-writingwith Justin Britt-Gibson before departing the project. Steven Knight is now reportedly writing.\nA week after the news of these films first broke, it began to seem like the Rey project by Obaid-Chioy could be the first one out of the gate. However, in June, Disney shuffled its release schedule and moved its December 2025 Star Wars movie to May 2026, and added a third Star Wars movie to the schedule in December 2026. So maybe these three movies are on those dates. We\u2019ll see.\nUpcoming Star Wars release dates\nThese shows and movies have all been officially announced and are in various stages of production, even if we don\u2019t know when they will definitely come out.\nStar Wars: Ahsoka\nRelease Date: Now Playing (On Disney+)\nThe first full live-action Ahsoka Tano show from co-creator Dave Filoni is finally here. Rosario Dawson is, of course, returning. And our first look at footage confirmed that actress Natasha Liu Bordizzo has been cast as Sabine Wren; more recently, Eman Esfandi was confirmed as Ezra Bridger. At Star Wars Celebration this year we learned Mary Elizabeth Winstead is playing Hera Syndulla, Lars Mikkelsenis playing Grand Admiral Thrawn and Wes Chatham is his right-hand man.\nWhat does that all mean? Well, in the first teaser trailer, you can see she\u2019ll make good onthe Star Wars Rebels finale and go after Thrawn. And what about the fact she knows Luke Skywalker now? And how does Ray Stevenson\u2019s lightsaber-wielding character fit in?\nThe show is now airing on Disney+ and here you can read our weekly recaps:\nEpisode 1, \u201cMaster and Apprentice: and Episode 2, \u201cToil and Trouble\u201d\nEpisode 6, premiering September 19\nEpisode 7, premiering September 26\nEpisode 7, premiering October 3\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew\nRelease Date: 2023 (On Disney+)\nCreated by Spider-Man Homecoming/Far From Home/No Way Home director Jon Watts along with writer Chris Ford, this mystery Star Wars show is now currently in development. The title for the show was released during the Star Wars Celebration, and was previously internally referred as \u201cGrammar Radio.\u201d Celebration also revealed its headlining star, Jude Law.\nSet after the events of Return of the Jedi, Skeleton Crew is described as an adventure in the mold of Amblin adventures of the 1980s. The show will be about seeing the galaxy through the eyes of children (but it is not a kids show), and will follow a group of children who get lost in the galaxy and try to find their way home. Jon Watts explained that the series will take place during the same time period as the upcoming Ahsoka series and The Mandalorian.\nFilming on the series began in 2022 and ended in early 2023. And though not much is know about what happens on the show,it has been revealed that The Daniels, the Oscar-winning directors of Everything Everywhere All At Once, directed an episode. Ditto David Lowery, who did the film The Green Knight. Read more about the show here.\nio9 saw the first footage at Star Wars Celebration 2023 and you can read about it here. Three of the main stars of the show are played by Ravi Cabot-Conyers, Kyriana Kratter, and Robert Timothy Smit. Rumors suggest it could debut in November or December 2023.\nStar Wars: The Acolyte\nRelease Date: 2024 (On Disney+)\nRussian Doll co-creator Leslye Headland will be the first person to bring the excellent High Republic timeline into live-action with this show, long rumored to star Amandla Stenberg before an actual confirmation finally arrived at San Diego Comic-Con 2022\u2014one of few Star Wars bits of news to emerge from the convention.\nIn an interview in 2022, Headland revealed the show would be about 100 years before the events of The Phantom Menace. \u201cA lot of those characters haven\u2019t even been born yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a look at the political and personal and spiritual things that came up in a time period that we don\u2019t know much about. My question when watching The Phantom Menace was always like, \u2018Well, how did things get to this point?\u2019 How did we get to a point where a Sith lord can infiltrate the Senate and none of the Jedi pick up on it? Like, what went wrong? What are the scenarios that led us to this moment?\u201d\nIn an interview released later, Headland spoke about her goals for the series. For Headland, above all else The Acolyte is a mystery, and that mystery is figuring out what is going on in this peak period. It was also suggested that The Acolyte will bring more elements from the Expanded Universe to canon, but what parts that will be incorporated will remain to be seen.\nIn September 2022, both Jodie Turner-Smith and Squid Game\u2019s Emmy-winning Lee Jung-Jae joined the cast, with an official announcement in November adding Carrie-Anne Moss, Manny Jacinto, and others to the roster. The first image, which you see above, was released in November and you can read about the first footage here, which was shown at Star Wars Celebration 2023.\nAnd no, despite what bullcrap rumors you may have been reading online, the show has not been canceled.\nAndor: Season 2\nRelease Date: August 2024 (On Disney+)\nSeason one of Tony Gilroy\u2019s Rogue One prequel starring Diego Luna showed an excitingly different side of Star Wars. Season two will reportedly be spread across the four years leading up to Rogue One, with four episodes covering each year in Cassian Andor\u2019s life until that fateful point. Filming began in late 2022.\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023, Gilroy announced the show should be out in August 2024 and showed fans the first footage from the season. Read about it here. Plus, the final episodes of the season/series will take place just days before Rogue One, leading right into that story.\nOne minor hiccup though, due to the Writer\u2019s Guild strike, showrunner and head writer Tony Gilroy left his duties show in May 2023. He\u2019s unlikely to return until the Writer\u2019s Strike is over, which could cause a delay.\nStar Wars: A Droid Story\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nLucasfilm Animation is teaming up with Industrial Light and Magic for this streaming show that will \u201cintroduce us to a new hero, guided by legendary duo R2-D2 and C-3PO.\u201d We don\u2019t know anything beyond that and there hasn\u2019t been a significant update in years, which could be a good thing or bad thing.\nStar Wars: Lando\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nWay back in December 2020, Disney announced a bunch of Star Wars TV shows. Among them was a Lando show which, at the time, was going to be made by Dear White People creator Justin Simien. After that, things went quiet for about three years. Then,in an April 2023 article, Donald Glover hinted that he\u2019s still interested and it\u2019s still possible in the works. A May 2023 interview with Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy confirmed it\u2019s still in the works.\nThe first significant update in almost three years came in July when news broke that Simien has been off the project since he started working on Haunted Mansion, and not only is Donald Glover going to star in the series, he\u2019s co-writing it with his brother Stephen.\nUntitled Taika Waititi Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nIn May 2020, news broke that Oscar-winning director of Thor: Ragnarok would be helming and co-writing along with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. \u201cTaika\u2019s approach to Star Wars will be fresh, unexpected, and \u2026 unique,\u201d Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said. \u201cHis enormous talent and sense of humor will ensure that audiences are in for an unforgettable ride.\u201d\nThere was a time when this was likely to be the next Star Wars film but, after Star Wars Celebration 2023, it seems like it\u2019s now on the back burner. That was confirmed by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy who said the Oscar-winner is still working on the film, it\u2019s just going slowly.\nIn the past, Waititi has discussed some broad ideas of what he wants to do with his upcoming film. Read those below.\nTaika Waititi Doesn\u2019t Want Star Wars to Rely on Legacies\nAre You as Confused About Taika Waititi\u2019s Star WarsMovie as We Are?\nUntitled Dave Filoni Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nWe mentioned this one above but, at some point, Dave Filoni will be directing a film that is meant to be a climactic event wrapping up stories that have begun on shows he\u2019s involved with such as The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, The Book of Boba Fett, Skeleton Crew and others.\nUntitled James Mangold Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nThis was one of the three films announced at Star Wars Celebration but, like Filoni\u2019s, isn\u2019t likely to be next. This one is set 25,000 years before the original trilogy and tells the story of the first person to use the Force.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about, I want to be part of the saga, but I also don\u2019t want to be holding so much lore in the air that you can hardly tell a story,\u201d Mangold told io9 when asked about this film. \u201cAnd what I really wanted to do\u2026was just can we make a kind of the Ten Commandments of the Force, you know? A kind of origin story of how the Force came to be known, understood, wielded, and harnessed.\u201d We love this idea so much we even wrote about it.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Haven\u2019t Been Officially Announced, But We Think Are Still Happening\nThe Mandalorian Season 4\nRelease Date: TBD\nWith The Mandalorian Season 3 now in the books, all eyes look ahead to season 4. However, the season has not yet been officially announced. Unofficially though, series creator Jon Favreau said he\u2019s already written a fourth season which he probably wouldn\u2019t have done just for fun. It\u2019s coming. It\u2019s just a matter of when, especially with writers and actors on strike.\nThe Book of Boba Fett Season 2\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nThe Book of Boba Fett season one ended with the implication that we\u2019d see more of these character in the future. But alas, there has been no official announcement\u2026 yet. Dive into the making-of season one while we wait and ponder the words of executive producer Robert Rodriguez who said he knows when the character is coming back, but he can\u2019t say when.\nUntitled Shawn Levy Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nShawn Levy, the prolific director and producer behind Stranger Things, Night at the Museum, and Free Guy is gearing up to develop a film in a galaxy far far away. He\u2019ll focus on that after completing Deadpool 3, which stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Probably NOT Going To Happen\nStar Wars: Rangers of the New Republic\nOriginally announced alongside shows like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka, and Andor, Rangers of the New Republic was rumored to be Cara Dune\u2019s show which would tie into The Mandalorian and Book of Boba Fett. However, with actress Gina Carano no longer a part of Star Wars, word on the street is this will no longer be happening. Nothing is official though.\nUntitled Rian Johnson Trilogy\nLet\u2019s be honest. Do we think this is happening anymore? Probably not. Rian Johnson has moved on to other things. But, until we hear otherwise (and no one is officially saying), we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t mention that before the divisive release of The Last Jedi, Lucasfilm officially said Johnson would make his very own trilogy. It hasn\u2019t officially been canceled yet but, in a new interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy suggested that it\u2019s been placed on the back burner as Johnson does other things. With Johnson\u2019s next film, Glass Onion, set for release in late 2022 though, he\u2019s been quoted saying he still hopes these movies happen. So do we.\nStar Wars: Rogue Squadron\nFor several years, Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins\u2019 film about pilots in the Star Wars universe has been earmarked as the next film. Well, that\u2019s no longer the case. After months of rumors suggesting it might move off its 2023 release date, Disney officially took it off the schedule. On December 13 2022, Jenkins said the movie is still in \u201cactive development\u201d but recent news suggests it\u2019s dead. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy disagrees, saying in May 2023 it\u2019s still on the books.\nUntitled Kevin Feige Movie\nMarvel Studios President Kevin Feige is best known for helping create the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But as much as he loves Marvel, he loves Star Wars even more. And so it was exciting to hear that he was producing a Star Wars movie and even recruited Loki and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness writer Michael Waldron to help him. Feige doesn\u2019t like to even acknowledge this project though and in a 2022 interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy also tiptoed around the project\u2019s existence. Then, a few weeks before Star Wars Celebration 2023, we learned the project is likely dead.\nFor more, check out io9\u2019s list of every canceled (or re-worked) Disney Star Wars project.\nWant more io9 news?

Engage!\nThis post was last updated 7/14/23.\nCurrently Airing: Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Season 2\nThe Enterprise is back after a successful first season, and this time Captain Kirk will be along for the ride with another appearance by Paul Wesley after his surprise finale role in season one. Not much else is known about the season so far, other than one episode will see the show crossover with Star Trek: Lower Decks in a live-action/animated hybrid directed by The Next Generation\u2019s Jonathan Frakes. The show has also been renewed for a third season.\nSeason two recaps:\n\u201cTomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\u201d\n\u201cCharades\u201d\nUpcoming: Star Trek: Lower Decks Season 4\nThe third season of the animated series following the misfit crew of the USS Cerritos\u2014and in particular its cadre of ensigns, Mariner (Tawny Newsome), Boimler (Jack Quaid), Tendi (No\u00ebl Wells), and Rutherford (Eugene Cordero)\u2014once again followed our heroic ensigns and the remaining bridge officers aboard the Cerritos.

As her romantic partner Book (David Ajala) pays time for his own role in a campaign to surreptitiously destroy that anomaly, we\u2019re not sure what awaits Burnham and Discovery\u2019s crew just yet, but given this show, we\u2019re sure it\u2019ll be very, very dramatic.\nIn Flux: Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2\nThe animated series aimed at younger Trek fans (and Janeway fans!) and kids at heart can be found on both Nickelodeon and Paramount+. The first season was divided into two parts, with part two wrapping up at the end of 2022; after Paramount+ announced it would not move forward with the show\u2019s already greenlit season two, it was removed from the service.

      "text": "Endings can be the true killer in a scary movie. The moment all the questions are resolved, a film risks breaking its spell with viewers. But that\u2019s not the case with writer-director Zach Cregger\u2019s Weapons, which built a kind of pre-cult following by amping up that it\u2019s a mystery: why 17 school children in a small town suddenly vanished. So far, critics have praised the Barbarian filmmaker for sticking the landing.\n\u201cThe last 10 mins will surely be a contender for best scene of the year,\u201d tweeted Empire editor in chief Nick de Semlyen. \u201cThe ending is strong and satisfying and leaves you discontented in all the right ways,\u201d wrote Los Angeles Times critic Amy Nicholson. The finale\u2019s been praised for being as original as it is disturbing.\nNow that the film has debuted, Cregger is finally willing to share his own interpretation of what that ending really means. Consider this your warning if you haven\u2019t seen Weapons already: spoilers below.\nThe mystery is established in the opening scene of Weapons: A child narrator explains that one day, 17 elementary-age school kids\u2014all of them from the same class\u2014vanished without a trace at exactly 2:17 a.m. The time was noted by various security cameras that captured their silhouettes darting into the streets of their neighborhoods. Josh Brolin plays an irate father, one of many adults who blame the class\u2019s teacher (played by Julia Garner), while Benedict Wong costars as a besieged school administrator, and Alden Ehrenreich is a hot-headed local cop.\nThe resolution to the mystery centers on Alex Lilly, played by 9-year-old Cary Christopher (the voice of the lost owl in An Almost Christmas Story). Alex is the only boy from the lost class to show up for school. The reason he didn\u2019t vanish is because an unsettling family member is responsible for the disappearance. A strange woman named Gladys, played by Amy Madigan\u2014the secret weapon of Weapons\u2014has moved in with his family, bringing a bizarre little tree whose branches give her magical power over anyone she chooses.\nOne downside of maintaining the mystery is that Cregger has had to avoid talking about Madigan\u2019s work in his film. \u201cLook, I\u2019m more than happy to sing Amy\u2019s praises in the press all day long. She\u2019s so incredible in this movie. Without her, the movie doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Cregger says. \u201cShe saved me. It\u2019s just hard to discuss her character without getting into spoilers, so it\u2019s tricky.\u201d\nEssentially, Weapons is a modern version of an old-school fairy tale. Children wander into the woods and find themselves in the clutches of a witch. \u201cI saw a lot of Pied Piper conjecture online,\u201d Cregger says.\nThere is an undeniable supernatural quality to Gladys. She takes a piece of hair or clothing, weaves it around one of her sticks, and uses an otherworldly power to turn her victims into mindless drones. She can direct them to attack viciously, almost zombie-like\u2014as she does to Wong\u2019s doomed school official\u2014or she can merely capture them and drain the lifeforce that she seemingly requires.\nThat\u2019s what she does to the school kids, who are arrayed around the Lilly family basement, standing stock still as the poor boy tries to keep them alive by force-feeding them canned soup. His parents (Whitmer Thomas and Callie Schuttera) are also under the spell of Gladys, who is apparently some kind of aunt to the boy\u2019s mother. They sit all day in a stupor on the living room sofa, doing nothing\u2014except when Gladys makes them hurt themselves (by repeatedly stabbing their own faces with a fork, in one instance) to motivate the boy to keep up appearances outside the home. Gladys doesn\u2019t puppeteer him, since her cover relies on him seeming normal.\nThe wrecked parents are a detail that Cregger says he drew from his own history. \u201cThis is more of a diary entry about me,\u201d he says. \u201cThe last chapter of this movie is straight-up autobiographical. That was my childhood. You live with an alcoholic parent, and there\u2019s this inversion of the dynamic. The child can become the [caregiver].\u201d\nIn Weapons, the destructive force is Gladys. But in real life, addiction is the spell-caster, he says. \u201cThis foreign substance comes in and it changes everyone\u2019s behavior,\u201d Cregger says. \u201cThe house becomes a scary place. You can go to school and act like everything\u2019s cool, and then you come home and you hide from a zombie parent. That felt so real to me.\u201d\nThe filmmaker emphasizes that he wasn\u2019t trying to preach a sermon about the children of addicts. Rather, he was simply inspired by things that once terrified him. \u201cI\u2019m trying to just suck the venom out, you know what I mean?\u201d he says.\nIn the end, Alex musters the courage to use Gladys\u2019s own spell-casting tree against her, sending the platoon of missing children on a house-to-house rampage as they chase down the witch and tear her limb from limb.\nIt\u2019s a cathartic ending, if not a happy one. In a chilling final line, the child narrator notes that the missing kids may have been rescued, but they never recovered from their brainwashing.\nAnswers about the true nature of Gladys are destroyed along with her body.\nSo who or what exactly was this weird old woman in Weapons? Cregger himself has only theories, no solid confirmations. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer, but I love that I don\u2019t know the answer. I don\u2019t need to know the answer,\u201d he says. \u201cI just need to know that it\u2019s all possible.\u201d\nHe discussed the possibilities with Madigan as she shaped her performance. \u201cI presented Amy with two options of her origin story. I was like, \u2018You can pick one of these two,\u2019\u201d Cregger says. \u201cThey\u2019re very different options. And was like, \u2018You don\u2019t have to tell me, but it is either this or that.\u2019 I don\u2019t know which one she picked.\u201d\nOne is that she was once a regular person, but her spells and corrosive actions are a last-ditch effort to heal herself of a life-threatening illness. In that scenario, he said, \u201cShe had to adopt this methodology that she uses out of a place of emergency to keep herself alive. I won\u2019t say any more than that.\u201d\nThe other option was that maybe she\u2019s not a person at all. The off-kilter red wigs and outlandish make-up suggest Gladys is some other kind of creature, trying to simulate what she thinks a normal human being looks like. But she\u2019s doing it very badly. \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting way to think about it. I like that a lot,\u201d Cregger says.\nThis was one of the possibilities he presented to Madigan, which he framed in the context of Javier Bardem\u2019s Oscar-winning role as the uncanny, unstoppable killer in No Country for Old Men. \u201cI talked with her about the Anton Chigurh character. You get this sense Anton Chigurh is potentially an immortal who has come to New Mexico and is doing an impression of the people around him,\u201d Cregger says. \u201cThat\u2019s why his haircut is so wrong and his clothes are clean, because he\u2019s doing a bad impression of these Southwesterners.\u201d\nCostume designer Trish Summerville (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) dressed Gladys in a style that can only be called \u201cderanged grandma.\u201d Cregger jokes that his immortal witch must have inadvertently drawn inspiration from geriatric retirees when she decided to venture into this small town. \u201cI like to think that maybe Gladys went to Boca Raton and looked around, and then just scraped an outfit together, and was like, \u2018This is what a person does, right?\u2019\u201d he jokes. \u201cShe didn\u2019t really think it through. Maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nThe witch\u2019s facade cracks only twice. \u201cAmy does this amazing thing where she shape-shifts throughout this movie. You never really feel like you\u2019ve pinned her down, except maybe when she\u2019s threatening Alex at the breakfast table,\u201d Cregger says. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re seeing the real her, or maybe the real her is this vulnerable thing.\u201d It happens when Alex offers to do what she commands, if only she\u2019ll leave. \u201cAmy looks so hurt by the fact that he doesn\u2019t want her to stay in the house,\u201d Cregger says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Is that the real her?\u2019\u201d\nMadigan\u2019s unusual appearance was augmented with withering prosthetics from Autonomous F/X and make-up artist Jason Collins. When Vanity Fair visited the studio with Sebastian Stan for our May cover story, Madigan\u2019s sculpted head was on display, allowing pieces of Gladys\u2019s patchy hair and wrinkled face to be applied and tested. \u201cAmy\u2019s actually got a fair amount of prosthesis on her face,\u201d Cregger says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to go too far. It\u2019s just one toe into the grotesque. That was the balance.\u201d\nBy far, the most crucial ingredient in Gladys was Madigan herself, who sold the kookiness while maintaining the menace. \u201cWith Amy in Field of Dreams, you see this sparky Chicago ball of energy, and it\u2019s got that natural ebullience that I wanted,\u201d Cregger says. \u201cThen you watch Gone Baby Gone, and she has this total command and this stillness in. She\u2019s just magical in that movie. I was like, \u2018Okay, so she\u2019s got the weight and she\u2019s got the fluff.\u2019 And then you watch Carnival, and she\u2019s terrifying. I just could smell that she had everything I needed.\u201d\nHe recalled driving to Malibu to meet her for lunch when he was casting the part. \u201cI was like, \u2018Okay, Zach, don\u2019t offer her the role at lunch, even if it goes well.\u2019 Because I\u2019m an impulsive person,\u201d the filmmaker says. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, dude: Within 10 minutes of sitting down at the table\u2014the food hadn\u2019t even come yet\u2014I was like, \u2018You have to play this part! There\u2019s no one else. It has to be you.\u2019 It was just so clear just looking at her. I was like, \u2018This is it. I don\u2019t need to hunt any further.\u2019\u201d\nIt may be the only thing about Gladys that came with certainty.\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\nZen and the Art of Being Jennifer Aniston\nCan And Just Like That\u2026 Actually Stick the Landing This Time?\nThe Real Problem With Sydney Sweeney\u2019s American Eagle Ad\nThe Heartbreaking Love Story of Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson\nInside the Celebrity Boat Trip That Was All Over Your Feeds\nInside King Charles\u2019s Lesser-Known Castle\nThe Hidden Case of the Transgender Baronet\nFrom the Archive: Dating Jeffrey Epstein"

      "text": "The DC Extended Universe is finally giving Marvel a run for its money\u2014something that\u2019s bound to increase now that James Gunn is running the show. The DCEU\u2019s myriad projects stretch far beyond superhero mainstays Batman, Superman, and the Justice League, promising to include new and interesting takes on DC Comics\u2019 enormous stable of characters.\nWhat follows is an up-to-date list of everything DCEU-related that\u2019s on the way: DC movies heading to theaters, as well as DC streaming movies and shows coming to Max.\nLast updated 8/23/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next DC Movie?\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom\nRelease date: December 20 (in theaters)\nDirector James Wan returns for the next adventure following Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) as the newly crowned King of Atlantis. Now in his new role, Arthur will explore more of the world under the sea while also dealing with new threats from Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and others. Like Shazam 2, Aquaman 2 has endured its share of release-date changes, with its new Christmas 2023 date designed to give Wan and company ample time to complete all the necessary special effects.\nUpcoming DC Movie Release Dates\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\nRelease date: October 4, 2024 (in theaters)\nTodd Phillips never saw his Joker movie as anything but a singular film. But over a billion dollars at the box office and an Oscar for Best Actor (for star Joaquin Phoenix) obviously changed things. We have a few nuggets of info so far: the title is Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux(French for \u201cshared madness\u201d), Phoenix is returning and will co-star with Lady Gaga (who\u2019s playing Harley Quinn), Zazie Beetz is probably returning as Arthur Fleck\u2019s neighbor, and\u2026 it\u2019s likely going to be a musical? Filming wrapped in early April 2023.\nThe Batman 2\nRelease date: 2025 (in theaters)\nHot off the success of Matt Reeves\u2019 long-awaitedThe Batman, everyone involved made it clear that wasn\u2019t a one-and-done. Robert Pattinson\u2019s Batman will be back. Will he face off with the Joker? It\u2019s possible but not definitive. You\u2019d imagine the Penguin and Catwoman could be back too. We don\u2019t know much yet about this one, but we do know it won\u2019t be arriving until 2025.\nCurrent DC Shows\nDoom Patrol Season 4, Part 2\nRelease date: TBD 2023 (on Max)\nThe fourth and final season of Doom Patrol\u2014starring Brendan Fraser, Matt Bomer, Diane Guerrero, April Bowlby, Joivan Wade, Timothy Dalton, Skye Roberts, and Michelle Gomez\u2014already aired its first batch of episodes; the remaining six will return later this year.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows Without Release Dates\nThe Penguin\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nYou saw him in The Batman and now, Colin Farrell\u2019s Penguin is getting his own Max series. As of April 2023, the show is in production, with a cast that also includes Cristin Milioti, Rhenzy Feliz, Michael Kelly, Shohreh Aghdashloo, and Deirdre O\u2019Connell, with Clancy Brown and Michael Zegen recurring.\nPeacemaker Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nFrom the instant that opening credits scene rolled for the first time, DC fans and non-fans alike fell in love with Peacemaker. Well, he\u2019s coming back, still played by John Cena and still from the twisted mind of James Gunn. There\u2019s no word on when it\u2019ll happen but we\u2019re guessing 2024.\nSuperman: Legacy\nRelease date: July 11, 2025\nJames Gunn will write and direct this Superman movie, which is touted as not being an origin story. Casting announcements started with Clark Kent/Superman and Lois Lane, who\u2019ll be played by David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan. We also know Isabela Merced will play Hawkgirl, Edi Gathegi is Mister Terrific, and Nathan Fillion is a Green Lantern (Guy Gardner), as well as Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho.\nMore Upcoming DC Movies and Shows Announced for the Gunn/Safran Era\nThe shake-up at DC Studios got a huge zap of energy at the end of January, when James Gunn and Peter Safran announced their massive slate of planned projects. Little is known about most of these projects so far in terms of cast and crew and even release dates\u2014but we do have a few tidbits for each.\nCreature Commandos (An animated Max show) \u2013 A seven-episode animated series written by James Gunn himself. It stars Indira Varma (Obi-Wan Kenobi, Game of Thrones) as the Bride, who\u2019s the lead character, and Marvel veteran Frank Grillo as Rick Flagg Sr.\u2014father of Rick Flagg, played by Joel Kinnaman in The Suicide Squad. The rest of the cast includes David Harbour (Stranger Things) as Eric Frankenstein, Sean Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as G.I. Robot, Zoe Chao (The Afterparty) as Nina Mazursky, Alan Tudyk (Star Wars: Rogue One) as Dr. Phosphorus, Maria Bakalova (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as new character Princess Ilana Rostovic, and Peacemaker\u2019s Steve Agee and Sean Gunn returning as John Economos and Weasel, respectively.\nWaller (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Viola Davis will reprise her Suicide Squad character; the story will bring back characters from the Peacemaker show and tell a story with events set between Peacemaker seasons one and two.\nLanterns (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Set on Earth, this mystery series will follow Hal Jordan and John Stewart doing their thing as DC\u2019s \u201csuper cops.\u201d\nThe Authority (Theatrical film) \u2013 The Wildstorm superhero characters will make their big-screen debut in a film co-written by Gunn.\nParadise Lost (A live-action Max show) \u2013 How did Wonder Woman\u2019s world, Themyscira, come to be? Find out in this Game of Thrones-ish tale set before her birth.\nThe Brave and the Bold (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on the acclaimed Grant Morrison comic run, this will explore the story of Batman\u2019s son, Damien Wayne, and will feature \u201cother members of the extended Bat-family.\u201d\nBooster Gold (A live-action Max show) \u2013 The \u201closer from the future\u201d superhero character gets his own series.\nSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on Tom King\u2019s comics run, this movie will explore how Supergirl is different from Superman. It\u2019s not yet certain if Sasha Calle, who plays Supergirl in The Flash, will reprise the role here.\nSwamp Thing (Theatrical film) \u2013 The character\u2019s \u201cdark origins\u201d will be the focus of this one. DC does horror! Rumored but not yet confirmed to be directing, James Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) told Collider that he\u2019s slated to write the script.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows That Were Once in Development, But Whose Fate Is Unclear in the Gunn/Safran Era\nTa-Nehisi Coates and J.J. Abrams\u2019 Superman movie\nRelease date: Unknown (in theaters)\nThe news of Superman: Legacy cast uncertainty on this project from writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and producer J.J. Abrams. There hadn\u2019t been an update on this one in a while, but in late April, James Gunn himself told io9 that the two films don\u2019t necessarily cancel each other out: \u201cThat\u2019s an exciting movie \u2026 if it comes in and it\u2019s great \u2026 and if the timing is right, that could absolutely happen. That\u2019s totally unrelated. It would be an Elseworlds tale like Joker.\u201d\nMichael B. Jordan Superman Series\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nMichael B. Jordan was once developing a Superman take for Max as a limited series that would feature Val-Zod as opposed to Clark Kent. Again, there hasn\u2019t been an update in a while.\nStatic Shock\nRelease date: Unknown\nPart of the relaunch of the Milestone comic brand is this adaptation produced by, once again, Michael B. Jordan. A writer was hired back in 2021 to come up with a script and we haven\u2019t heard much since.\nJustice League Dark\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nJ.J. Abrams was among the people involved with bringing this evil super-team to life and while there hasn\u2019t been a ton of movement on the project of late, it\u2019s been around long enough that we\u2019d imagine it happens eventually.\nMetal Men\nRelease date: Unknown\nOne of the more recent pre-Gunn/Safran DC films to go into development, this is this tale of six beings based on various powerful metals. It\u2019s from directors Ron Clements and John Musker (Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and Moana), so if it happens, it\u2019ll have an incredible pedigree.\nZatanna\nRelease date: Unknown\nLast year, Emerald Fennell won an Oscar for writing Promising Young Woman. She followed that up landing the job to write this DC superhero flick about the young magician. Like most of the films in this section, there hasn\u2019t been movement in a while.\nHourman\nRelease date: Unknown\nYes, the hero who takes a drug that makes him a hero for an hour was, back in 2021, rumored to be in development. Whether or not that\u2019s still the case is unknown but we figured it was worth noting.\nUntitled Arkham Show\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nIn addition to The Penguin, Matt Reeves has said he plans to expand the world of The Batman into Max shows. At one point, a series about Gotham PD was in the works, but now he says it might be more about the inner workings at Arkham Asylum. On October 25, The Staircase\u2019s Antonio Campos came aboard as a writer\u2014the third to hold that position on the potential series so far\u2014and may direct and serve as showrunner if the show happens, according to a report in Variety.\nWant more io9 news?

Devery Jacobs (Reservation Dogs) co-stars. Echo officially began filming on May 24, according to a tweet by series creator Marion Dayre. According to James Clement on an episode of the Weekly Planet podcast, both Vincent D\u2019Onofrio and Charlie Cox are set to return for the Echo series at Disney+.\nThe series was recently announced along with Ironheart, Agatha Coven of Chaos and What If season 2 as potentially moving to 2024.\nX-Men \u201897\nRelease date: Fall 2023 (On Disney+)\nThe X-Men are coming to the MCU\u2026 kinda. X-Men \u201897 is a revival of the classic \u201890s animated show, bringing back the same style, stories and yes, theme song, of the iconic series. (See more: X-Men \u201897 Looks Like a Nostalgic Blast From the Past)\nIronheart\nRelease date: 2024 (On Disney+)\nWith Tony Stark gone, the MCU needs a new super-genius inventor. Enter teenage prodigy Riri Williams (played by Dominique Thorne), who creates a brand new, ultra-advanced armored suit. Other cast members include Anthony Ramos (In the Heights) as the villain the Hood and Lyric Ross (This Is Us). Chinaka Hodge (TNT\u2019s Snowpiercer) is attached as the head writer, and Black Panther director Ryan Coogler is an executive producer alongside Marvel\u2019s Kevin Feige and others. Manny Montana (Good Girls) has joined the cast of Marvel\u2019s Ironheart in an undisclosed role as well as Han Solo himself, Alden Ehrenreich.\nAgatha: Coven of Chaos\nRelease date: Winter 2024 (On Disney+)\nThis spinoff from WandaVision will star Kathryn Hahn as her fan-favorite character Agatha Harkness. Joe Locke (Heartstopper) and Aubrey Plaza (Hahn\u2019s Parks and Recreation co-star, among her other many credits) are also in the cast, as is Patti LuPone. (A second WandaVision spin-off, this one focusing on Paul Bettany\u2019s Vision, is also reportedly in the works.)\nCaptain America: Brave New World\nRelease date: August 26, 2024 (in Theaters)\nWe\u2019ve got a new Captain America, so it was inevitable that we\u2019d be getting a new Cap movie. Anthony Mackie will appear in the title role. Harrison Ford was announced to take over the role of General Thaddeus Ross and will make his debut in this release.\nDaredevil: Born Again\nRelease date: Spring 2024 (On Disney+)\nCharlie Cox and Vincent D\u2019Onofrio will return as Daredevil and Kingpin for an 18-episode Disney+ series.

This film marks the end of Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Steven Yeun (Nope) signed on for an undisclosed role\nBlade\nRelease date: February 14, 2025 (In theaters)\nDisney hasn\u2019t revealed much about this reboot of the franchise that features a badass vampire-hunter who is also a vampire, but we know that it stars two-time Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali, who also played Cornell \u201cCottonmouth\u201d Stokes in Netflix Marvel series Luke Cage. We also know Blade appeared (or at least his voice did) in the end credits of The Eternals. After losing director Bassam Tariq, who would have been the first U.S.-Pakistani person to helm a Marvel Studios film, Blade was put on pause, and its release date was shifted. But now it has a new director in place: Lovecraft Country\u2019s Yann Demange, as well as a writer in Michael Starrbury, so the September 2024 date looks ever more likely.\nDeadpool 3\nRelease date: May 3, 2024 (In Theaters)\nRyan Reynolds\u2019 \u201cmerc with the mouth\u201d is set to appear in Disney\u2019s first R-rated film following the company\u2019s completed acquisition of Fox assets. Oh, and did you happen to hear that Hugh Jackman\u2019s Wolverine is also appearing in this one? Unless you are cut off from all social media, you no doubt caught that announcement.\nDeadpool 3 writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wenick spoke with Den of Geek about how Deadpool\u2019s move to the MCU will not affect the feel of the movie. Or, in Wernick\u2019s words: \u201cDeadpool\u2019s gonna be Deadpool.\u201d Reese also said that Disney has been more than willing to ensuring the franchise keeps its core identity. Shawn Levy (Free Guy) is directing.\nFantastic Four\nRelease date: May 2, 2025 (In theaters)\nPhase Six of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, kicks off with the MCU debut of Marvel\u2019s most famous family. Jon Watts was scheduled to directbut he is no longer doing that\u2014Matt Shakaman of WandaVision is now in the chair\u2014and though we saw John Krasinski as Mr. Fantastic in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, there\u2019s no guarantee he returns.\nAvengers: The Kang Dynasty\nRelease date: May 1, 2026 (In theaters)\nSince neither Phase Four or Phase Five ended with Avengers movies, Phase Six will end with two, back to back. The first is The Kang Dynasty, a title which heavily suggests that Kang (Jonathan Majors) will play a major role. Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi) will direct.\nAvengers: Secret Wars\nRelease date: May 7, 2027 (In theaters)\nIt all comes down to this. Phase Six, and the whole Phase 4-6 arc of the Multiverse Saga, ends with Secret Wars. We don\u2019t know anything about the plot other than the comics that the title is based on; Marvel veteran Michael Waldron (Loki, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness) is writing the script.\nArmor Wars\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nThis project\u2014originally slated for a Disney+ series, but now getting the feature film treatment\u2014will follow James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) as he tracks down stolen tech that allows criminals to replicate Iron Man technology.\nAlso: Marvel slotted several other projects for Phase Six that take place alongside Fantastic Four and the Avengers films. There are two in fall 2024, two in winter 2024, one in winter 2025, two in spring 2025 and two in summer 2025. Some of those are probably\u2026\nUnscheduled But Probably Still Happening Shows & Movies\nMoon Knight Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nMoon Knight himself, Oscar Isaac, was recently spotted in Egypt and teased that a second season of his show could be on the way. Marvel and Disney have yet to confirm.\nMarvel Zombies\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nThis new animated show is loosely spun out from a breakout episode of What If? that saw MCU heroes battling a zombie apocalypse.\nSpider-Man: Freshman Year\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nDisney says this new animated series follows Peter Parker \u201con his way to becoming Spider-Man in the MCU, with a journey unlike we\u2019ve ever seen and a style that celebrates the character\u2019s early comic book roots.\u201d\nWhat if\u2026? Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nThe speculative animated series and its omnipresent narrator the Watcher will return with an all-new season. The show\u2019s creators say next season will focus on new stories, new heroes, and \u201clots of fun.\u201d Though the trailer still hasn\u2019t been released, the Marvel Animation Panel at San Diego Comic Con revealed some Phase 4 characters that will be in the show.\nUntitled Wakanda Series\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nNot much is known yet about this show set in Black Panther\u2019s home country.\nUntitled Shang-Chi sequel\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nShang-Chi\u2019s debut movie was compelling, exciting and fun. It also made a ton of money, so a sequel is inevitable. That the film\u2019s director is making Avengers: The Kang Dynasty does throw it into limbo a bit.\nUntitled Wonder Man series\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nMarvel Studios has announced that it\u2019s moving ahead with a Wonder Man series. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Destin Daniel Cretton is attached to helm and Brooklyn 99 writer Andrew Guest (who also produced Hawkeye) is on board to showrun the series. On October 31, the title star was announced: genre favorite Yayha Abdul-Mateen II.\nUntitled mutants movie\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nNow that Disney owns the old Fox assets that included all the \u201cmutant\u201d Marvel superheroes, you can very likely count on characters like the X-Men making an MCU debut.\nWant more io9 news?

That movie, called Weapons, is now almost here. And, based on the first reactions, he may have just blown those expectations away.\nCregger wrote and directed the film, which stars Julia Garner (Ozark, Fantastic Four: First Steps) as a teacher who walks into school one day to find almost her entire class has gone missing. No one else has gone missing. Just 17 students from her class only. And, in fact, they all simultaneously, at 2:17 a.m., got up out of bed, ran out their front doors, and never returned. That\u2019s the mystery at the center of Weapons, which unfolds in an almost Robert Altman\u2019s Nashville, Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s Magnolia version of a horror film with multiple characters\u2014Garner\u2019s, but also a father played by Josh Brolin, a cop played by Alden Ehrenreich, and others\u2014all reacting to this horrific mystery.\nIt\u2019s a very cool, intriguing premise that audiences will find out about on August 8. But, ahead of release, the film recently screened for press, and here are just some of the incredibly positive reactions, starting with yours truly.\n#WeaponsMovie is beyond messed up & I loved every second of it.\nIt's Magnolia the horror movie, as multiple characters circle a big, creepy mystery. Bit of a slow burn, but it pays off in huge, awesome, gory, disturbing ways.\nLess shocking than Barbarian, but much better. pic.twitter.com/lvnhOF4oNO\n\u2014 Germain Lussier (@GermainLussier) July 22, 2025\n#WEAPONS rules.

It's Prisoners by way of Magnolia with some of the Coen's absurdist humor. An absolutely BRILLIANT commentary on the attitudes and institutions during the fallout of a communal tragedy.

Still, Zach Cregger once again proves he has a gift for crafting a haunting atmosphere, using jump scares\u2026 pic.twitter.com/4qgbtsR9bz\n\u2014 Matt Neglia (@NextBestPicture) July 22, 2025\nWEAPONS is just as twisty as Zach Cregger's debut but allows the audience to piece together its mystery in a surprisingly funny and terrifying way.

Almost all the reactions are over-the-moon positive, with a few minor issues here and there. Which is to be expected. But, considering I myself am in those reactions, I feel confident enough to say that Weapons does live up to the Barbarian hype. These reactions aren\u2019t lying. And, as we get closer to the film\u2019s release on August 8, you\u2019ll see more reactions, more reviews, and much more on the film itself.\nBenedict Wong, Austin Abrams, June Diane Raphael, and Amy Madigan also star in Weapons, which comes to theaters August 8.

      "text": "Zach Cregger\u2019s latest movie, Weapons, is unforgettable. And not only because it\u2019s intense, gross, and fascinating, which it is. It\u2019s that the premise of the movie is so smart, seductive, and deeply disturbing that we\u2019d gladly watch a bad movie about it just to find out more. Thankfully, Cregger is able to build off his ingenious idea and deliver a constantly surprising and often horrific mystery that blends drama and scares in a way that creates something truly special.\nThe aforementioned premise of Weapons is, what if a schoolteacher walked into her classroom one morning and no one was there? Everyone else at the school is there. But for this one teacher, her class is missing. Making things worse, each and every student woke up at the exact same time in the middle of the night, ran out of their house, and never came back. What would that do to the teacher? What would that do to the community? What would that do to the parents? And what the heck actually happened?\nWritten and directed by Cregger, Weapons answers all those questions and more in an interconnected tale inspired by the sprawling epics of filmmakers like Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson. The film goes character by character through the story, with each section providing new answers as well as questions, all building to not just the reveals you are waiting for, but shocks and gore that are wholly unpredictable and super satisfying.\nThe first of those characters is Justine, played by Julia Garner. Justine is the teacher whose class is missing, and, of course, she becomes the scapegoat for the whole thing. Surely, she organized it. Surely, she knows something. And as more people get increasingly angry with and suspicious of her, we feel not just sympathy but a whole new kind of fear. There\u2019s also Archer, played by Josh Brolin. He\u2019s the father of one of the missing kids who blames Justine and decides to take the investigation into his own hands, turning up a few very unsettling revelations. Next up is Paul, played by Alden Ehrenreich. He\u2019s a local police officer with a questionable past who takes the story into even more directions. And on and on it goes through a few other characters you meet throughout the story.\nIn each of these sections, Cregger gives things a slightly different energy that keeps the movie moving. He also ends them all on a bit of a cliffhanger that lingers as we go into the next section. Plus, the sections cross over, so we see events from different points of view. This not only provides great character moments and drama, but it allows us to feel more fully invested in the story and keeps us filled with anxiety. Often, we feel like we know everything about a certain person or event, but a few minutes later, it\u2019s flipped on its head entirely. Then there are scenes and reveals that happen and don\u2019t come back for a while, laying on even more lingering anticipation.\nEach story has its fair share of jump scares and gross-outs, but those definitely become more prevalent as the film goes on. It\u2019s clear Cregger wants us to really live with this messed-up situation and explore what it\u2019s doing to these characters. He wants us to ponder how we would handle it. That slow burn of it all is maybe the only real criticism of Weapons. It hides its secrets for a very long time and backloads many of its more traditional horror elements. However, doing that also helps make those scenes even more shocking and satisfying. By the time answers arrive, they do so with a blood-soaked, jaw-dropping carnage that delivers sweet, sweet catharsis.\nCregger\u2019s previous film, Barbarian, shares some of Weapons\u2018 DNA but had a few wild pivots that made it feel like two or even three movies slapped into one. Weapons is not that. It\u2019s cohesive in a very assured way, with everything both fitting, and not, for just the right reasons. It\u2019s a movie that will scare you, surprise you, make you laugh, make you cheer, and make you cover your eyes as you slowly learn how these kids disappeared. And, by the end, the fact it\u2019s called Weapons not only makes sense, it makes the movie even more disturbing.\nCo-starring Austin Abrams, Benedict Wong, Amy Madigan, June Diane Raphael, and Cary Christopher, Weapons opens August 8.\nWant more io9 news?
