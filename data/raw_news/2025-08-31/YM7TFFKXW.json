  "content": "You know it\u2019s bad when CNN is admitting Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook likely committed mortgage fraud on all three properties she owns.\n\nFederal housing regulator Bill Pulte has officially sent two criminal referrals on embattled Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook after she was allegedly caught lying about a third property.\n\nAccording to Pulte, Cook misrepresented a condominium in Cambridge, Massachusetts when she claimed it was a \u201csecond home\u201d. Eight months later, Cook signed an ethics form with the US Government and represented the Cambridge property as an \u201cinvestment/rental property.\u201d\n\nBanks and lenders give more favorable loan terms and lower interest rates for second homes. Mortgage loans on investment properties have higher interest rates because they are considered high risk.\n\n\u201cIn subsequent filings from 2022 to 2025, Cook consistently listed this property as an investment/rental property, not a second home,\u201d Pulte said.\n\nLisa Cook also allegedly committed occupancy fraud (and perhaps tax fraud) on her two other properties.\n\nAccording to Pulte\u2019s first criminal referral, Lisa Cook committed mortgage fraud by lying on her mortgage application and falsifying bank statements when she designated her out-of-state Atlanta condo as her \u201cprimary residence\u201d\u2014just two weeks after taking a loan on her Michigan home, which she also claimed as her \u201cprimary residence.\u201d\n\nLisa Cook admitted in a court document that she manufactured documents and hinted a \u2018clerical error\u2019 is behind the mortgage fraud accusations.\n\n\u201cThere is some suspicious activity here that\u2019s really problematic by Lisa Cook,\u201d the CNN panelist said as he expanded on the fraud committed on all three of her properties.",

Cook, related to a mortgage on a 3rd property and alleged misrepresentations about her properties to the United States Government during her time as Governor of the Federal Reserve. On April 7, 2021, Cook entered a 15-year mortgage for a condominium in Cambridge, MA, representing it as her \u201cSecond Home\u201d. Only eight months later, on December 1, 2021, Cook signed an ethics form with the U.S. Government that this property was an \u201cinvestment/rental property\u201d. In subsequent filings from 2022 to 2025, Cook consistently listed this property as an investment/rental property, not a second home. Representing the property as a second home may have allowed Cook to secure a lower \u201cSecond Home\u201d mortgage down payment and rates, as investment properties typically carry higher down payments and higher rates due to increased risk. Additionally, Cook allegedly misrepresented her Atlanta, GA property from 2022-2025 to the U.S. Government as her residence, despite evidence suggesting it was being rented out to tenants. Similarly, Cook declared in a 2025 government filing that her Ann Arbor, MI property was her personal residence, however, we have reason to believe that as of 2025, the Ann Arbor property is being used as a rental property, not a personal residence. These inconsistencies appear Cook made additional, multiple false representations, including to the U.S. Government, regarding the status of her mortgages and properties.\n3 strikes and you\u2019re out.\nToday, U.S. Federal Housing sent a 2nd Criminal Referral in the matter of Lisa D.
