Newsom said Friday after the Trump administration demands a $1-billion fine from UCLA to settle antisemitism claims.\n- UC President James B. Milliken said such a payout would \u2018inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.\u2019\n- The proposal also covers protest rules, diversity scholarships and admissions data.\nHours after the Trump administration demanded that the University of California pay a $1-billion fine to settle federal accusations of antisemitism in exchange for restoring frozen grant funding to UCLA, Gov. Gavin Newsom called the proposal \u201cextortion\u201d and said the state will go to court to protect the nation\u2019s premier university system.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll sue,\u201d Newsom said during a news conference with Texas legislators over California\u2019s effort to counter a contentious Republican redistricting plan in that state.\nPresident Trump is \u201ctrying to silence academic freedom\u201d by \u201cattacking one of the most important public institutions in the United States of America,\u201d Newsom said, adding that he would \u201cstand tall and push back against that, and I believe every member of California Legislature feels the same way.\u201d\nMaking his first public comments about how the University of California should proceed in negotiations with President Trump over grant freezes, Gov. Gavin Newsom chided deals struck by Ivy Leagues and said the university would do \u2018the right thing.\u2019\nThe federal government on Friday said UC should pay the billion-dollar fine in installments and contribute $172 million to a fund for Jewish students and other individuals affected by alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The statute covers illegal discrimination related to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, including Jewish and Israeli identity.\n- Share via\nIn addition, the Trump administration demanded sweeping campus changes encompassing protests, admissions, gender identity in sports and housing, the abolition of scholarships for racial or ethnic groups, and submission to an outside monitor over the agreement, according to four UC senior officials who have reviewed the proposal.\n\u201cHe has threatened us through extortion with a billion-dollar fine, unless we do his bidding,\u201d Newsom said.\n\u201cWe will not be complicit in this kind of attack on academic freedom on this extraordinary public institution. We are not like some of those other institutions,\u201d he said.\nThe governor appeared to be referring to controversial and costly deals the Trump administration secured from Columbia and Brown universities over charges similar to those facing UCLA, deals Newsom criticized a day earlier in public remarks.\nIn a statement Friday that UC was \u201creviewing\u201d the terms, UC President James B. Milliken, who oversees the 10-campus system that includes UCLA, also seemed to rebuff the demand.\nGov. Gavin Newsom and California legislative and congressional members stood with Texas state lawmakers in their opposition to President Trump\u2019s plan to redraw voting maps to hold on to power in the midterm election.\n\u201cAs a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country\u2019s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians,\u201d Milliken said. \u201cAmericans across this great nation rely on the vital work of UCLA and the UC system for technologies and medical therapies that save lives, grow the U.S. economy, and protect our national security.\u201d\nUC Regents Chair Janet Reilly told The Times the university was still willing to negotiate with the Trump administration but not on \u201cunacceptable\u201d terms.\n\u201cDemand for a $1 billion payment from UCLA, coupled with conditions that contradict the university\u2019s values, is unacceptable,\u201d Reilly said, describing it as a \u201cfinancial burden\u201d that would be \u201ccatastrophic for our students, research, our patients and the people of California.\n\u201cThe university remains willing to engage in a constructive and good faith dialogue with the federal government but the University of California will always stand firm in protecting the integrity and values of our institution,\u201d Reilly said.\nA spokesperson for UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk referred The Times to Milliken\u2019s statement. Federal negotiations are being handled on a UC-wide level.\nUC is grappling with how to restore $584 million in frozen medical and science grant funds to UCLA. If the deal was accepted, it would be the largest settlement between a university and the Trump administration, far surpassing a $221-million agreement that Columbia University announced last month. Harvard is also reportedly considering a settlement involving a hefty fine.\n\u201cWe would never agree to this,\u201d said one of the UC officials who is involved in the deliberations with the Trump administration. \u201cIt is more money than was frozen at UCLA. So how does that make sense?\u201d\nBut another senior UC official said the figure was understandable if it resolved all federal investigations across the system, even if UC may not ultimately agree to it. The federal proposal focuses on UCLA only, not all campuses.\nAny payment would be a political liability for the university and state leaders in deep-blue California, where Trump\u2019s policies are highly unpopular. A billion dollars would be a financial burden for a university system that is already facing a hiring freeze, budget squeezes, deferred state funding and scattered layoffs.\nUCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk and UC President James B. Milliken on Wednesday said that federal grants suspensions total $584 million to the campus and university leaders will negotiate with the Trump administration to restore the funds.\nUC and individual campuses are under multiple federal investigations into alleged use of race in admissions, employment discrimination against Jews, civil rights complaints from Jewish students and improper reporting of foreign donations.\nUCLA has faced the most charges from the government of any UC or public university, many of them tied to a 2024 pro-Palestinian encampment.\nThe encampment, which unsuccessfully demanded the university divest from weapons companies tied to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, was targeted in a violent overnight attack last spring and was later the subject of federal lawsuit by pro-Israel Jewish students. The students, along with a professor, accused UCLA of enabling antisemitism by not shutting down the encampment, which plaintiffs said blocked pro-Israel Jews from campus pathways. UCLA settled the suit for $6.45 million, including more than $2 million in donations to Jewish nonprofits.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s Friday offer follows a similar playbook to agreements it reached with Columbia and Brown universities to restore federal funding and resolve allegations of civil rights violations against Jewish and Israeli students.\nTrump wants to remake universities, which he has called \u201cMarxist\u201d hotbeds of liberalism and anti-Israel sentiment. During his second term, federal agencies have suspended or canceled billions in federal medical and science grants related to gender, LGBTQ+ issues or in response to campuses it accuses of being antisemitic. The White House has also attacked campus diversity programs and admissions practices as being illegal discrimination against white and Asian Americans.\nUniversity leaders have challenged the notion that cutting medical research helps protect Jewish people. \u201cThis far-reaching penalty of defunding life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination,\u201d Frenk, the UCLA chancellor, said in a campus letter this week.\nAt UCLA, Trump\u2019s demands include an end to scholarships that focus on race or ethnicity, the sharing of admissions data with the government and changes to campus protest rules. The Trump administration is also proposing that UCLA Health and the medical school cease gender-affirming care for transgender people.\nUC has already overhauled practices in some areas called for by the Trump administration \u2014 including a ban on protest encampments and the abolition of diversity statements in hiring.\nThe Trump administration is also saying it wants an outside monitor to oversee the agreement.\nThe proposal came one day after Newsom said UC should not bend \u201con their knees\u201d to Trump. Newsom, a Democrat, has fashioned himself as a national anti-Trump figure and is considering a presidential run in 2028.\nThe university system, run by Milliken \u2014 who assumed his role only last week \u2014 and the Board of Regents, is independent under the state Constitution. But the governor can exercise political sway over the regents, whose members he appoints. Newsom also holds an ex-officio seat on the board.\nKaleem reported from Los Angeles and Wilner from Washington. Times staff Writer Taryn Luna in Sacramento and Seema Mehta in Los Angeles contributed to this report."

      "text": "Someone keeps stealing, flying, fixing and returning this California man\u2019s plane. But why?\n- Share via\nWhile Jason Hong was celebrating his 75th birthday, he suddenly found himself thinking about his 1958 Cessna Skyhawk, a white and red single-engine beauty with colorful stripes that he calls his \u201cold treasure.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t fly it much anymore, but given the occasion he resolved to visit his plane as soon as he could to \u201csay hi,\u201d like a lifelong friend you see around holidays and special occasions.\nHong headed to Corona Municipal Airport after church on July 27, but when he got there, the plane was not where he\u2019d left it. Hong was dumbfounded.\n\u201cI got confused,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, did I park it somewhere else, did the airport manager move it? But I looked all over.\u201d\nIt was gone.\nHong was so shocked, he initially didn\u2019t know who to reach out to about a missing, stolen plane. He wondered, did someone fly it out of the airport unnoticed? How long had it been missing?\nThe questions piled up. But the mystery only deepened.\nFamily and neighbors said the family appeared to live a quiet life. Yet hundreds of court records reviewed by The Times, including sworn declarations, surveillance footage images and an autopsy report describe a strained marital relationship and contentious divorce.\nAs Hong would come to find out, the colorful aircraft had been flown across Southern California by an unknown pilot, unnoticed, in a series of joyrides \u2014 or joy flights \u2014 at least twice before and then simply returned to the airport. Both Hong and police were left scratching their heads.\nThe first time he discovered it missing, Hong reported it to Corona police, unsure that he\u2019d ever see the plane he\u2019s owned for nearly 30 years again. After all, he thought, who steals an entire plane?\nThen on the morning of July 29, he got a call from La Verne Police, telling him his plane was found in Brackett Field Airport.\n\u201cThere\u2019s my airplane, sitting there in the airport,\u201d Hong said, finding cigarette butts and garbage strewn about in the cockpit.\nHe barely took time to process what happened when, frustrated, he decided to pull out the battery from the plane, close it up, and go home. The plane wouldn\u2019t start without the battery, he figured, and he could come back the next weekend when he had time to clean and inspect it.\nExcept that, when he returned that Sunday, Aug. 3, the plane had vanished again.\nHong reported the plane missing again with La Verne Police, and wondered what was going on. It wasn\u2019t long before he got another call. This time, El Monte Police told him his plane was sitting at San Gabriel Valley Airport.\nWhen Hong got there to inspect his plane, his confusion only grew.\n\u201cI found it with a battery,\u201d he said.\nIn 2022, a Brink\u2019s big rig transporting millions of dollars of jewelry was burgled at a Grapevine truck stop. The daring, late-night heist captivated the Southland.\nIt hasn\u2019t been just Hong who has found himself befuddled by his disappearing and reappearing plane.\n\u201cThis plane just keeps disappearing out of the blue,\u201d said Sgt. Robert Montanez of the Corona Police Department. \u201cIt\u2019s just weird.\u201d\nMontanez said when Hong reported his plane missing the first time, he\u2019d last seen the aircraft in May in the small Corona airport.\nFor police, a case of an entire plane being stolen was so rare, that officers used the same form used for stolen cars, to take Hong\u2019s report.\nOfficers are also aware that the plane has been taken multiple times, and returned, making the incidents more perplexing. But Montanez said there\u2019s no immediate indication as to who the culprit is.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no camera video, there\u2019s no real leads as to who stole the plane,\u201d Montanez said.\nAfter finding his plane a second time, Hong said he\u2019s tried to put details of the thefts together, but the more he learns the more he grows confused about the circumstances.\nHong looked up his plane on Flight Aware, a site that tracks flights and aircraft, and found that on his 75th birthday, someone took off with his plane from La Verne airport at 9:54 p.m., for a 51-minute flight that at one point neared Palm Springs.\nA few hours later, on July 26, the colorfully striped plane was in the air once again, this time for a brief 22-minute flight from Riverside County toward La Verne that started at about 1:30 a.m.\nIt was the next day that Hong would discover it missing.\nIn Los Angeles County, there is a black market for \u2018anything and everything,\u2019 said Capt. Calvin Mah, who leads the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s Major Crimes Bureau.\nAt first, Hong said, he thought it might have been a random incident, but the details of the repeating incidents didn\u2019t make sense to him, he said.\nThe multiple flights indicate that, whoever has taken his plane has had some sort of flight training, since they\u2019ve been able to land the plane on multiple occasions.\n\u201cLanding is not easy, so they\u2019re trained,\u201d he said.\nHong said he\u2019s also found a headset in the plane, as well as a new battery to replace the one he removed, meaning this mysterious pilot had spent hundreds of dollars on equipment to get his plane back in the air.\nThe replacement of the battery, Hong said, also suggests its someone familiar with not just flying, but the mechanics of the plane as they seemed to have the tools and know-how about the type of battery needed, and how to install it.\nHaving his airplane stolen has been frustrating, Hong said. But learning that the suspect has also been spending money and equipment to use \u2014 and return \u2014 the plane has just been confusing.\n\u201cSomeone breaks into your house, they\u2019re looking for jewelry or cash right?\u201d he said, trying to reason with the circumstances. \u201cBut in this case, what\u2019s the purpose? It\u2019s like someone breaks my window, and then they put a new one up.\u201d\nThe fact that someone has been traveling in it to different airports also puzzles him.\nThe 75-year-old Yorba Linda resident said he\u2019s spoken to regular pilots and employees at the San Gabriel Valley Airport in El Monte, who said that they saw the plane flying in and out of the airport multiple times in July.\n\u201cOn and off, they flew in and out, in and out, almost an entire month without knowing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is really a rare situation.\u201d\nOne regular at the airport, Hong said, told him he saw a woman, about 5 feet, 3 inches tall, and in her 40s or 50s, flying and sitting in the plane on multiple occasions. The man told Hong he had a conversation with her at one point, and distinctly remembered her because she was often seen sitting in the cockpit during the day, making people at the airport wonder why she wouldn\u2019t just relax in the air-conditioned airport lounge.\n\u201cVery strange,\u201d Hong said.\nFor now, Hong has chained his plane in San Gabriel Valley Airport and said he\u2019s uncomfortable flying it until he can thoroughly inspect it.\nOther than that, he\u2019s not sure what to do to keep his plane grounded, or to find out who has been secretly flying it out.\n\u201cI have no idea what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the strangest thing.\u201d"

      "text": "Wal-Mart to pay $2-million state penalty\n- Share via\nRetail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has agreed to pay $2.1 million for not complying with a judgment against the chain for overcharging customers in California, the attorney general\u2019s office said.\nThe 2008 judgment had directed the retailer to fix pricing errors discovered during a government investigation into its California stores.\nThe 2005 investigation found that 164 Wal-Mart stores in the state had scanned some items at higher prices than advertised on shelves and signs. Under the judgment, customers who are overcharged should have received $3 off an item\u2019s lowest advertised price, or receive products that cost under $3 for free.\nBut a subsequent investigation in 2010 to monitor Wal-Mart\u2019s compliance found continued pricing errors at its stores, the attorney general\u2019s office said.\nIn addition to the penalty, Wal-Mart will extend the $3-off program to November 2013 and put large signs describing the policy at checkout stands in its 180 California stores. The retailer will also tap an employee at every store in the state to ensure pricing accuracy and report any discrepancies to its Bentonville, Ark., headquarters.\n\u201cConsumers should feel confident that the price on the shelf will be the same price they are charged at the cash register,\u201d Atty. Gen. Kamala D. Harris said in a statement.\nWal-Mart spokesman Steven Restivo said the retailer would comply."

      "text": "- Share via\nA wildfire that broke out in the hills near the Los Angeles and Ventura county line amid a heat wave this week continued to grow Friday, forcing thousands to evacuate, destroying at least two buildings and challenging firefighters battling flames in extreme heat.\nThe Canyon fire, burning toward Castaic, had exploded to 5,400 acres by Friday afternoon, though officials reported it was 25% contained.\nTaking advantage of cooler temperatures Thursday night into Friday morning, crews were able to make some inroads against the fast-moving blaze that grew to several thousand acres in a matter of hours, said Ventura County Fire Department spokesperson Andrew Dowd. But he said the fight ahead remains challenging, given the hot weather, rugged terrain and a parched landscape that, together, can foster extreme fire growth.\n\u201cWe are seeing some flare-ups in various parts of the fire,\u201d Dowd said. \u201cWe still have record-low fuel moisture in the area, so we\u2019re not letting our guard\u201d down.\nTwo small structures, probably sheds or outbuildings, have been confirmed destroyed, Dowd said. Officials have not confirmed any homes or businesses damaged, but video from the scene showed a few buildings destroyed or engulfed in flames, though it wasn\u2019t immediately clear if that was additional damage from the two small buildings.\nResidents in the Val Verde area said flames were visible from the neighborhood\u2019s western edge Thursday, but the threat appeared to have calmed a bit by Friday morning, though the air remained thick with soot and ash.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of smoke. The air is really, really bad,\u201d Jennifer Elkins, president of the Val Verde Civic Assn., said Friday. Her neighborhood was under an evacuation order Thursday afternoon, but was able to return home Friday.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just kind of staying locked up indoors and keeping an eye on things,\u201d Elkins said. \u201cThis is a really tough fire season, and I\u2019m really glad the Fire Department is really taking every fire seriously. ... This is a pretty big threat to the community.\u201d\nThe Canyon fire quickly became one of the largest of several fires sparked during days of intense heat in Southern California. To the north in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, the much larger Gifford fire has burned nearly 100,000 acres.\nUnfortunately for firefighters on the ground, the heat is expected to persist into the weekend, though temperatures may drop a degree or two.\nTemperatures were forecast to peak Friday at 98 degrees around the Canyon fire, and that heat plus the winds, low humidity and parched landscape would continue to create elevated fire conditions through the weekend, said Mike Wofford, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Oxnard.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ripe for fires and fire spread,\u201d Wofford said.\n\u201cAlthough a few degrees of cooling is expected through the weekend, a very warm air mass will remain in place. An onshore flow regime will keep temperatures from exceeding record levels, but temperatures are expected to remain above seasonal normals as high pressure aloft lingers over the southwestern United States,\u201d the weather service said in a Friday morning forecast.\nVentura County officials said the fire broke out just before 2 p.m. Thursday \u2014 when temperatures were peaking around 100 degrees \u2014 near Holser Canyon Road, northeast of Piru, a small, unincorporated town not far from Castaic Junction.\nThe fire was initially reported to be about 30 acres, but within about two hours that estimate jumped to over 1,000 acres, according to Ventura County officials. By midnight, it had spread across 4,856 acres and was racing east toward Castaic and Interstate 5 in L.A. County.\nThe Canyon fire is threatening areas around Piru and Castiac. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\nAbout 2,500 residents and 700 structures remained under evacuation orders Friday afternoon, mostly in northern Los Angeles County near Castaic, while an additional 14,000 people and more than 4,700 structures were affected by evacuation warnings, according to Dowd.\nMore than 400 firefighters were assigned to the incident, according to fire officials.\nL.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger, who represents the Santa Clarita Valley, urged residents to heed evacuation alerts.\n\u201cExtreme heat and low humidity in our north county have created dangerous conditions where flames can spread with alarming speed,\u201d Barger said in a statement. \u201cIf first responders tell you to leave, go \u2014 without hesitation. The Eaton fire showed us how quickly devastation can strike.\u201d\nAn evacuation center was opened in the East Gymnasium of the College of the Canyons, at 26455 Rockwell Canyon Road in Santa Clarita.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union raised concerns about the fire\u2019s proximity to the Pitchess Detention Center, where about 5,000 inmates are housed in four jails. The center is east of the 5 Freeway and fell just outside an evacuation warning zone the first night of the fire.\nSenior staff attorney Melissa Camacho said she was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the growing fire.\n\u201cJanuary\u2019s Hughes fire burned within a half-mile of the jails and not a single person incarcerated there was evacuated,\u201d Camacho told The Times. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking that, less than eight months later, the 5,000 people in the jails and their loved ones will spend another sleepless night watching a fire and praying that it doesn\u2019t reach them.\u201d\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Department, which operates the facility, said it was actively monitoring fire conditions and was in constant communication with fire and county officials.\n\u201cSimilar to evacuation plans implemented at Pepperdine University in Malibu, the Fire Department has advised that a shelter-in-place strategy is the safest option for custody staff and inmates, given the building construction type and current fire behavior,\u201d agency spokesperson Nicole Nishida said in a statement. The area around the building has been cleared of brush and has wide defensible space, she said.\nGov. Gavin Newsom on Friday announced that the state had secured Federal Emergency Management Agency support to help pay for the fight against the blaze. The Fire Management Assistance Grant can provide federal funding for up to 75% of eligible firefighting costs, including expenses for field camps, equipment use, supplies and mobilization, and demobilization activities, according to FEMA."
