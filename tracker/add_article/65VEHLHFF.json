      "summary": "Romania is home to the largest population of brown bears in Europe outside Russia, with estimates between 10,000 and 13,000. However, since a hunting moratorium in 2016, the bear population has grown, leading to increased human-bear conflicts, including 20 fatalities. Rukmini Callimachi, a reporter with Romanian roots, highlights this troubling shift in the human-bear relationship in her recent article.",
