  "content": "5 Of The Most Advanced Chinese Fighter Jets (That We Know Of)\n\nChina has proven through its modern fighter jet design that it is ready to take on its Western counterparts in dogfight scenarios. The J-10 defeated French Rafales in the Pak-India combat of May 2025. The two major fighter jet manufacturers in China, the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC) and the Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC), are leading the market with continuous innovation in next-gen fighters. For instance, the country is working on developing its own sixth-generation jets, China's new Chengdu J-36 and the Shenyang J-50, both of which are the subject of speculation among aviation enthusiasts. Elaborating on the most advanced Chinese fighter jets that have dominated the skies so far, several attributes combined make them a powerful addition to any air force. To name the most critical aspects, it would be powerful mechanics, careful design, precise maneuverability, and, of course, on-spot targeting systems.\n\nDesigned to compete with its Western counterpart, the F-35, the Chinese J-35 features several impressive key points, each of which aids in its remarkable performance against the enemy. It is a fifth-gen carrier-based fighter with a sleek design to help cruise through the air at a staggering top speed of Mach 2 (1535 mph), aided by its twin-engine design. It has a maximum takeoff weight of about 28 tons and can cover a combat radius of approximately 750 miles. This advanced fighter is applicable for air superiority as well as ground attacks and features an AESA radar system, along with electro-optical targeting systems. The much-awaited J-35A is expected to have the PL-10 short-range missile and PL-15 beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile systems on top of three internal weapon bays and four external hardpoints for loading additional gear. Apart from this, there's a twin diverterless supersonic intake for reduced infrared radar reflections and enhanced aerodynamic efficiency in the air. The larger dorsal fuselage hump allows for more fuel capacity, giving the fighter some additional flying range. With a wide-angle holographic heads-up display and advanced infrared sensors, the pilot can track all movements.\n\nBeing a brainchild of the SAC, the J-16 stealth fighter is a twin-engine and twin-seat aircraft that is capable of rigorous air-to-air combat. These fighters entered the People's Liberation Army in 2015 and can carry different missile systems, such as the PL-10, PL-12, PL-15, and PL-17, for a range of air combat situations. The J-16 can reach a maximum speed of Mach 2.4 (1,841 mph) and a climb rate of 325 m/s. Its maximum range is up to 3,000 kilometers. The modern cockpit design and a superior radar system help in marking targets, plus there are specialized variants for Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) and Electronic Warfare (EW). Powered by WS-10B turbofan engines, the fighter can generate high thrust. All these features make it a multi-role aircraft that can handle air superiority, ground strike, and suppression of enemy air defense, as well as electronic warfare. The most recent country seeking the J-16 aircraft is Iran, as it is looking to expand its air force capabilities following the war with Israel. The J-16D variant is an electronic warfare fighter possessing superior jamming abilities, thanks to the integration of an advanced active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar system.\n\nThe J-20 manufactured by the CAC is a single-seat twinjet that can deliver exceptional performance in the air regardless of weather conditions. A fifth-generation fighter, the J-20 showcases impressive air superiority and a precise striking system. Like the others in the family, it also features the AESA radar and a 360-degree infrared targeting system with powerful resistance to jamming to engage in contested air battles. Moreover, the modern aircraft is compatible with a range of air-to-air missile systems, such as the PL-9, PL-10, PL-12C/D, and PL-15\u2013PL-21 \u2014 basically covering short and long-range targets. Additionally, there are four hardpoints on the wings to load more weapons. Surprisingly, the J-20 surpasses the famous F-22 and F-35 in terms of speed. Nationalsecurityjournal.org reported some configurations of the J-20 capable of speeds as high as Mach 2.8 (2,000+ mph). The F-22 Raptor is also in the Mach 2 class, reaching Mach 2.2 (1688 mph). The F-35 Lightning reaches Mach 1.6 (1228 mph). The \"Mighty Dragon\" is a goldmine for gathering intelligence against enemies and engaging in electronic warfare. Overall, the J-20 is equipped with advanced communication systems and real-time data sharing features to plan coordinated attacks, particularly the twin-seat J-20S variant. With a huge combat range of 2,000 km (1243 miles), paired with aerial refueling ability, the fighter has excellent stealth that can serve well in critical missions that require extensive awareness of the enemy positions.\n\nAn iconic fighter jet, the JF-17 Thunder is a joint collaboration between the Pakistani Aeronautical Complex (PAC) and China's Chengdu Aerospace Corporation (CAC). It is a 4.5-gen fighter jet with a maximum takeoff weight of 29,762 pounds and a top speed of Mach 1.6 (1,228 mph), powered by 19,000 pounds of engine thrust. In addition, it can climb up to heights of 16,920 m at a rate of 300 m/s, with seven hardpoints for carrying weapons up to 9,920 pounds. Integrated with modern avionic and electronic systems, this fighter jet is capable of identifying multiple targets simultaneously to attack in a coordinated manner. The JF-17 Thunder Block III has garnered significant attention on a global stage after it successfully engaged in the May 2025 cross-border tensions between Pakistan and India. On its way to the U.K. for the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) 2025, the jet carried out a successful mid-air refueling that further attracted interest in it. Pakistan secured a $4.6 billion deal to sell 40 JF-17 multirole fighters to Azerbaijan in June 2025. The popularity of the J-17 has only been growing following the internationally admired performance of the PAF during the recent events.\n\nThe Chengdu J-10 is marketed in the military world as a fourth-generation multi-role fighter that famously goes by the title \"Vigorous Dragon.\" Very recently during the Pakistan-India tensions, the PAF utilized the combination of advanced J-10C jets and PL-15E air-to-air missiles to shoot down three French Rafale jets of the Indian Air Force, the very first jet to take down the French fighter. Coming to the specifications of this mighty variant, it is one of the fastest single-engine fighter jets flying today at a top speed of Mach 2 (1535 mph), powered by a WS-10B turbofan engine. The structure offers 18,000 m of operational ceiling height and a combat radius between 684 and 932 miles. Highlighting the newfound importance of this jet in the industry, a Chinese military affairs expert told the Global Times, \"China's cutting-edge equipment, represented by the J-10 series fighter jet, is profoundly reshaping the global perception of the Chinese military and China's defense industrial capabilities, even the landscape of the global defense industry.\" Hence, it is evident that the J-10 is much more than a domestically produced jet for China. It features the county's most advanced integrations, such as digital fly-by-wire flight control with total authority, composite airframe construction, and aerodynamic mastery. And because the jet recently proved itself in a real-life air-to-air combat battle, the international interest in China's J-10 has significantly grown.",

      "text": "Everything To Know About Pakistan's JF-17 Thunder Fighter Jet\nPakistan isn't a country many people think of as having a large air force, and to be fair, it doesn't. The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) is relatively small compared to nations like Russia, China, and the United States, but that doesn't mean it's not flying impressive aircraft. The PAF operates numerous modern aircraft, including American F-16 fighters and French Mirage aircraft. It also flies the JF-17 Thunder fighter jet, which is an intended replacement for the F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jet.\nThe JF-17 was co-developed by China's Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC) and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC). Despite Chinese involvement in its development, the People's Republic of China doesn't operate the JF-17, though it's not exclusively flown by the PAF. The first prototype came out of the CAC factory on May 31, 2003, and since then, production has increased to around 25 new jets each year. As of September 2024, at least 138 JF-17s have been produced, with another 30 on order.\nJF-17s began flying for the PAF in 2007 and have since become the dominant workhorse fighter aircraft operating for Pakistan. Since its introduction, the aircraft has received several updates, resulting in the JF-17 Block III first introduced in December 2023. In addition to Pakistan, three nations also operate the JF-17. World Air Forces 2024's downloadable PDF details which nations operate them and list Myanmar with seven JF-17B and another nine on order. Nigeria flies three, while Azerbaijan has placed an order for eight. Here's everything you need to know about Pakistan's JF-17 Thunder fighter jet.\nThe JF-17's specifications\nThe JF-17 is a 4.5-generation fighter, making it comparable to the newest models of the F-15, F-16, MiG-35, Su-30, and the Eurofighter Typhoon. The aircraft is 47 feet long, 15 feet high, and has a relatively tight wingspan of 31 feet. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 29,762 lbs. The JF-17's maximum speed is Mach 1.6 (1,227 mph), and it has a service ceiling of 55,500 feet. The aircraft's G-limit is +8 and -3, and it has a maximum engine thrust of 19,000 lbs. and a thrust-to-weight ratio of 1.07. Additionally, the JF-17 has an operational radius of 842 miles, though it can be refueled in the air.\nFor armament, the JF-17 boasts eight stations capable of carrying a load of around 7,500 lbs. There is a large variety of different types of ordnance available for the JF-17, including air-to-sea missiles, laser-guided weapon systems, runway penetrating bombs, stand-off weapons, a variety of bombs to use as duds for training purposes, and a 23 mm double barrel gun. Many of the JF-17's munitions are for beyond-visual-range targeting, and they are highly agile and maneuverable vehicles capable of delivering deadly payloads.\nIn addition to its weapon systems, the JF-17 boasts a variety of electronics and avionics that make it a highly capable modern fighter. Its radar system is highly adept at tracking multiple targets, which it can then prioritize. There's also a built-in jamming protection suite, a smart heads-up display for the pilot, multiple color displays, and a high-tech communications system. The JF-17 is a capable modern fighter that will come to dominate Pakistan's skies. Additionally, future exports could see the JF-17 fly for numerous nations, including Sri Lanka, Egypt, and Malaysia.\nThe JF-17 is combat-tested\nSometimes, when a nation introduces a fancy new military machine like the JF-17, it can take years before they're ever used in combat. Occasionally, an aircraft or naval vessel like the United States' Ohio-class nuclear missile submarines are rarely, if ever, used in combat, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Still, when a nation invests tens to hundreds of millions of dollars into a new system, it can feel wasted if it never sees any action. This isn't the case for the JF-17, which has been tried and tested in battlespaces against a variety of enemies, and it's come out on top.\nIn 2014, Pakistan engaged in Operation Zarb-e-Azb, which targeted terrorists operating along its border with Afghanistan. In 2017, the PAF used a JF-17 to shoot down an Iranian UAV seen operating inside Pakistan's airspace across their shared border. Two years later, JF-17s attacked India in retaliation for attacks, resulting in JF-17s shooting down two Indian fighter jets, marking the first engagement and successful downing of another aircraft in a dogfight.\nIn January 2025, Pakistan directed its JF-17s to attack Iran in Operation Marg Bar Sarmachar in retaliation for a terrorist attack against Pakistan with ballistic missiles. The strike was incredibly successful, eliminating an enclave of terrorists while causing significant damage to their infrastructure. These incidents all add up to one glaring conclusion: The JF-17 is a highly capable multirole fighter that can stand up against comparable aircraft in a variety of engagements against a multitude of enemies."

      "text": "J-10 fighter jets attached to an aviation brigade of the air force under the Chinese PLA Southern Theater Command take off in succession during a day-and-night flight training exercise. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Shang Jieyan)\nAt the ongoing Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition (LIMA 2025) in Malaysia, global aviation powers are showcasing their top-tier equipment. The J-10CE fighter jet, the export variant of the J-10C, took the center stage at the Chinese booth, shortly following its remarkable debut in real combat, captivating international visitors and military analysts who were eager to observe the aircraft.\nA Chinese military affairs expert told the Global Times that China's cutting-edge equipment, represented by the J-10 series fighter jet, is profoundly reshaping the global perception of the Chinese military and China's defense industrial capabilities, even the landscape of global defense industry.\nWhen Western media mentions the J-10 fighter jet, they often simplistically describe it as \"independently developed by China.\" However, Chinese military affairs expert Zhang Xuefeng explains that the significance of the J-10 fighter to the Chinese Air Force and China's aviation industry far surpasses that of just a \"domestically produced fighter.\"\nThrough the development of the J-10, China has mastered advanced aerodynamic configuration technologies for fighter jets, achieved breakthroughs in full-authority, triaxial, quadruple-redundant, digital fly-by-wire flight control systems and propelled the development of advanced turbofan engines. For the first time, China developed a highly integrated and digital avionics system, enhancing overall combat effectiveness. Additionally, China has established a new-generation aircraft manufacturing system characterized by digital machining, composite material construction and titanium alloy manufacturing. This has laid a solid foundation for the subsequent development of China's fighter aircraft, Zhang told the Global Times.\nAt the same time, the J-10 fighter jet was independently developed by China's aviation industry and possesses independent intellectual property rights, Zhang noted. After its successful development, the Chinese military was able to extensively equip itself with domestically produced advanced fighter jets. This has significantly alleviated China's security pressures and, to some extent, altered the balance of air power between China and neighboring countries and regions, advancing preparations for military struggles. Today, the J-10 series of fighter jets continues to evolve and remains actively deployed on the front lines of training and exercises, he said.\nSince the official commissioning of the J-10 fighter jet in 2006, it has rapidly become a mainstay combat aircraft of the Chinese Air Force. It has frequently represented both the Chinese Air Force and China's aviation industry in various domestic and international public events and military exercises.\nIn 2009, the Bayi Aerobatic Team of the Chinese Air Force transitioned to the J-10A and J-10S as their demonstration aircraft. In 2023, the team upgraded to the more advanced J-10C fighter jets. Leveraging the aircraft's cutting-edge performance and the pilots' exceptional skills and supported by the YU-20 aerial tanker, the Bayi Aerobatic Team has repeatedly conducted non-stop long-distance flights to perform at international airshows. These missions serve as an emotional bridge, fostering global understanding of the Chinese Air Force and promoting peaceful friendship between China and other nations, while also showcasing China's growing aviation capabilities.\nIn recent years, the J-10 series fighter jets have become a star product of China's aviation industry on the international stage, frequently showcased at global defense exhibitions. The LIMA 2025 kicked off on Tuesday, and the Global Times learned that the J-10CE attracted particular attention among the exhibited items. Many visitors took photos with the model of the J-10CE.\nPreviously, Western experts habitually evaluated the J-10 through a biased lens, claiming that while its specifications look good on paper, it lacks actual combat experience. However, this stereotype was quickly shattered when major media outlets, home and abroad, made continuous coverages on that China's made-for-export J-10CE warplane had recently achieved its first real combat success. .\nZhang said that China's advanced fighter jets, represented by the J-10, are participating in international market competition and reshaping the global defense industry landscape with multiple advantages. Chinese fighter jets offer high cost-effectiveness. For example, India bought France's Rafale fighters at a cost of nearly $200 million per unit, including spare parts, training and support services. In contrast, Chinese fighters deliver comparable performance at a more affordable price. Moreover, China can provide a range of models at different prices tailored to the buyer's needs, better meeting the practical demands of various countries.\nIn the past, when people talked about Chinese fighter jets, the impression was mostly about their cost-effectiveness. But now, the J-10C has proven its true combat prowess through real-world operational experience, Zhang said.\nChina is capable of exporting a complete system of weapons and equipment, including advanced fighter jets and various types of airborne munitions, Zhang said, adding that China can also offer early warning aircraft and integrated data links, enabling systematic and informatized upgrades.\nThe development of China's advanced fighter jets, represented by the J-10 series, serves as a vivid microcosm of the country's continuous self-reliant progress in national defense and technological capabilities. It once again demonstrates China's determination, resilience, and confidence in achieving technological self-sufficiency and strength, Zhang said."

      "text": "All The Unusual Design Features Of China's New J-36 Fighter Jet\nThe J-36 is not just another stealth plane with a design that throws out decades of fighter-jet convention. China's newest prototype uses a tailless flying-wing configuration with sharply cranked double-delta wings, forming a shape rarely seen in manned fighters. It's a fully-embraced design pivot intended to reduce radar signature from every angle, not just the front. No vertical stabilizing structures mean no obvious radar return on the rear or sides, something even the now-discontinued F-22 and highly-advanced F-35 couldn't fully eliminate. These features contribute to making the J-36 a ghost in the skies as far as detection systems are concerned.\nDr. Emily Carter, an aerospace analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C, told Bulgarian Military.com, \"The combination of a delta wing and stealth features is unusual, but it makes sense if you consider the kind of threats China is preparing for.\" The shape of the J-36 borrows from Lockheed's 1970s F-117A \"Hopeless Diamond\" stealth concept. The design was too unstable to fly back then, but modern flight computers changed the game. The J-36 likely uses advanced fly-by-wire controls and perhaps AI-assisted systems to stay airborne without traditional stabilizers.\nIts triple-split elevons (control surfaces) and twin-split brake rudders help handle pitch, yaw, and roll, compensating for the lack of vertical structures. If you are wondering about the jet intakes, it boasts two side-mounted caret-style inlets and one dorsal supersonic inlet, all positioned to feed three engines. That's not a typo. This thing has three engines in the back, something no other current fighter boasts.\nTrijet power and internal muscle\nThe three engines use low-observable exhausts to reduce the J-36's infrared signature. While it's unclear what engine model powers it, the Shenyang WS-10C or a prototype WS-15 are prime suspects. The trijet layout gives the J-36 high-altitude endurance and possibly even supercruise (the ability to exceed the speed of sound without afterburners). All these breakthroughs have forced even the U.S. Department of Defense to admit that the Chinese Air Force is \"rapidly approaching technology typical of U.S. standards.\" The report also hints at another big priority: range.\nEarly estimates peg the J-36's combat reach at up to 3,000 km, far more than the J-20. That isn't just for show; it allows the J-36 to carry more internally without compromising performance. This thing is heavy, with a maximum takeoff weight possibly around 55 tons, and that weight is distributed wisely. Between its wide wings and deep belly, the J-36 has room for massive internal weapons storage. It can likely carry long-range PL-17 missiles, YJ-12 anti-ship missiles, and possibly land-attack munitions, all without hanging anything on the wings. Even the dual-wheel landing gear (two wheels each on all three struts) reinforces how much mass the airframe supports.\nDesigned to command as well as fight\nThe J-36 isn't built just to dogfight. If anything, it's designed to avoid close-range combat entirely. Its real role seems to be that of an undetectable long-range command-and-control hub; the kind of aircraft that can see far, shoot far, and direct unmanned assets deep behind enemy lines. It's the physical expression of system-of-systems warfare: a manned centerpiece surrounded by drone swarms and supported by satellites, radar, and electronic warfare units.Its advanced sensor array likely includes side-scanning Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar and electro-optical sensors.\nAlong with its large internal volume, this makes the J-36 perfect for the modern networked battlefield. It can link with \"loyal wingmen\" drones and coordinate air-to-ground strikes; think less dogfighter and more aerial destroyer. Some analysts have floated that exact term, comparing it more to a naval command ship than a traditional jet fighter.This expansion of aircraft roles is part of a global trend. The U.S. Air Force's futuristic NGAD and B-21 Raider have begun to blur similar lines, and China is responding in kind.\nWith its stealth capabilities, range, and payload, the J-36 can hit far-off targets and manage engagements from well behind the front lines. Its real strength may not be what it can take out, but what it can coordinate. That makes the J-36 not just a new plane, but a preview of how wars will be fought in the future. As defense analyst Alex Hollings told the Eurasian Times, the J-36 is a \"serious contender in the evolving landscape of air warfare.\""

      "text": "5 Of The Fastest Single-Engine Fighter Jets Still Flying Today\nTwo is one and one is none; This saying speaks volumes about the role of redundant systems within the military. In life-or-death situations such as combat, having a working backup could mean the difference between life and death. In few places is this ethos more prevalent than in aviation. Aeronautical engineers, both military and civil, go to extraordinary lengths to make sure there's always a plan B when designing new aircraft.\nThe enhanced performance and safety capabilities of multi-engine aircraft make them ideal for military operations. Iconic fighters like the lightning-fast F/A-18 Super Hornet and the cutting-edge F-22 Raptor of the sixth generation achieve remarkable speeds thanks to their dual engine power plants. However, the addition of a second engine comes with significant challenges. While it provides additional power, it also contributes to the aircraft's weight. The inclusion of an extra engine not only boosts power and payload, but also increases drag and weight, necessitating a delicate balance in aircraft design.\nThat's why the era of the single-engined fighter plane is far from over. A single-engine power plant remains a reliable method of keeping a fighter aircraft agile and maneuverable. Some of the most advanced and respected aircraft in the world achieve remarkable speeds with just a single engine, and many are still in use today.\nGeneral Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon \u2013 1,500 mph\nA multirole fighter, the F-16 Fighting Falcon achieved operational status in the United States Air Force in 1978. While it might be old, this fourth-generation fighter is aging spectacularly. The inaugural F-16A model used a single Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-200 engine, which made 23,830 pounds of thrust in afterburner mode. With a cruising speed of 577 mph, a range of up to 1,407 miles, and an altitude ceiling of 55,000 feet, the Fighting Falcon \u2014 later nicknamed the Viper by pilots and crew \u2014 exceeded its designers' wildest hopes.\nThe modern F-16 may be a couple of generations behind the latest and greatest, but it still holds its own, thanks to the gradual improvements it went through. The modern Viper uses 29,000 pounds of thrust on its journey to speeds faster than Mach 2.0 \u2014 twice the speed of sound and over 1,500 mph.\nThe F-16 is not only one of the fastest fighters flying, but it can also compete with and even outperform more recent efforts to build an excellent all-around fighter. The F-16 is a worldwide success with an enviable record, and it doesn't seem like that will change soon: While few nations are capable of building and maintaining sixth-generation fighters, 29 countries operate an estimated 3,100 of the single-engined F-16 speedster.\nChengdu J-10 Vigorous Dragon \u2013 1,450 mph\nFighter aircraft development is a decades-long road, and China first announced its intent to join the top ranks of worldwide air forces with the J-10 Chengdu Vigorous Dragon in 1998. More than a quarter-century later, the J-10's public appearances remain sparse, but we do know certain things about the mysterious fighter.\nThe latest version of the Vigorous Dragon is the J-10C. It comes equipped with a scanner called active electronically scanned array (AESA) and carries PL-10 infrared homing missiles. The J-10 is used by China's military, but it's also exported to other countries, which is how the plane scored its first victories flying a foreign flag. The latest J-10 uses a WS-10B engine producing over 30,000 pounds of thrust, while thrust-vectoring technology makes the J-10 capable of otherworldly maneuvers at low speeds. As for top speed, China is naturally reticent about sharing this detail, but sources peg it in the 1,400 mph/Mach 1.8 range.\nKnown as the 'Firebird' by NATO naming nomenclature (we vastly prefer Vigorous Dragon), the plane recently undertook its aerial combat debut when Pakistani J-10s allegedly shot down four Indian aircraft in May 2025, including at least one twin-engined Dassault Rafale. This victory will no doubt make potential buyer and seller nations take notice. The J-10 seems to have arrived, and it might be fighting for bids \u2014 and aerial victories \u2014 with aircraft like the F-16.\nSaab JAS 39 Gripen \u2013 1,500 mph\nThe Gripen, built by Saab, first took flight in 1988, slowly making its way through development and testing until its debut with the Swedish Air Force in 1997. The modern Gripen E variant made its maiden journey in 2019, and Sweden and Brazil established the first foreign production line for the aircraft in 2023.\nWhile less famous than the F-16 or the J-10, the JAS 39 Gripen is the backbone of Sweden's air defense strategy. Developed during the Cold War, the Swedish Air Base System calls for dispersing air forces around the country and operating from the nation's highway system in case of war. In such scenarios, aircraft like the Gripen would operate from hidden hangars and use ultra-short runways that would be, essentially, sectioned-off highways.\nThe Gripen E may have been born well after the Cold War, but Saab's design ethos for the plane endures. This plane uses a single GE F414G jet engine, making up to 22,000 pounds of thrust in afterburner. With a maximum takeoff weight of 36,000 pounds, it can get airborne with a 17 by 546 yards-long runway, and can land within 656 yards without external braking forces such as a hook or parachute. Once down, it can rearm within 20 minutes. In high-altitude flight, a properly-equipped Gripen on a speed run can hang with the F-16 and the J-10. Its top speed under ideal conditions can go above Mach 2.0, or around 1,500 mph.\nLockheed Martin F-35 Lightning 2 \u2013 1,200 mph\nThe F-35 Lightning 2, a marvel of military aviation, is a subject of fascination for enthusiasts and a point of contention for budget experts. While it may not match the raw power of the twin-engined F-22 Raptor, a few unique features and capabilities set it apart.\nThe Lightning 2's unique abilities revolve around its single engine, a thrust-vectoring Pratt & Whitney F135 that generates 43,000 pounds of thrust for each of the Lightning 2's three variants. The F-35A takes off and lands like a conventional fixed-wing aircraft. The B model is capable of short takeoff/vertical landing (STOL) operations. The F-35C is a maritime asset rigged for catapult takeoffs and tailhook landings on aircraft carriers.\nThe F-35 has external hardpoints for armament, but it can also carry weapons internally, resulting in a streamlined fuselage. The lack of angles and protrusions reduces the F-35's radar cross-section, keeping it off enemy radar screens. Internal weapon bays reduce drag, helping the F-35 achieve speeds of up to 1,200 mph, or Mach 1.8. It might not be as fast as the Gripen or the F-16, but the versatility of its variants, combined with high performances, gives it a place on this list.\nMiG-21 Fishbed \u2013 1,300 mph\nThe soviet fighter jet MiG-21, named Fishbed by NATO, was born the same year as the Tri-Five Chevy, but it remains active in more than one air force today, and it is still one of the fastest single-engine fighters around. This absolute legend is by far the oldest aircraft on this list, having been built by the Soviet Union in 1955. Essentially an enormous jet engine with wings, it was in production until 1985, with over 10,000 units built.\nSome MiG-21s came equipped with a Tumansky R-11F2-300 jet engine that made 13,000 pounds of thrust. While that is not a lot of thrust, compared to other engines on this list, the MiG-21 was more like a rocketship than a fighter aircraft. That low thrust rating could still propel it to 62,000 feet, and a top speed run could hit 1,300 mph. It was a supersonic spaceship that could carry two measly K-5 missiles, and nations are still using it today.\nTo be fair, those nations are not known for advanced aviation industries. India is arguably the most powerful on the list, and it is moving fast to update. As of 2023, Yemen, Syria, Angola, and North Korea still used MiG-21s in some capacity."

      "text": "Key Points and Summary: China\u2019s J-20 \u201cMighty Dragon\u201d presents a unique challenge to Western air power, primarily through its one key strategic advantage: range.\n-With a combat radius that far exceeds the American F-22 and F-35, the J-20 is purpose-built for the vast distances of the Indo-Pacific.\n-This allows it to conduct long-range patrols and deep-penetration missions without heavy reliance on aerial refueling.\n-While its stealth and agility may differ from U.S. fighters, the J-20\u2019s emphasis on range, combined with long-range missiles, makes it a formidable tool for projecting power and threatening assets far from China\u2019s shores.\nThe J-20 Has the Range As a \u2018Secret Weapon\u2019\nThe Chengdu J-20 \u201cMighty Dragon\u201d was the first stealth fighter produced in China and one of the first stealth fighters produced outside the United States. Though its stealth properties have been questioned by experts, one of its greatest advantages lies in its impressive combat range.\nWith a range of around 2,000 km, the J-20 far exceeds the American F-22 and F-35 in this arena, allowing it carry out longer combat missions, protect China\u2019s borders, and project power further.\nThe J-20\u2019s Range\nOne of the most notable aspects of the J-20 is its combat range. Estimates place its combat radius between 1,243 and 1,367 miles (approximately 2,000 to 2,200 kilometers), which is significantly greater than that of the F-22 Raptor, whose combat radius is around 529 to 759 miles (850 to 1,220 kilometers).\nThis extended range gives the J-20 a strategic advantage in terms of reach, allowing it to conduct long-range patrols, deep-penetration missions, and intercept operations without relying heavily on aerial refueling. This capability is particularly important in the vast expanses of the Indo-Pacific region, where distances between potential conflict zones can be substantial.\nThe J-20\u2019s impressive range is achieved by its powerpack. The J-20 initially relied on Russian AL-31FM2 engines, but more recent variants have been equipped with Chinese-made WS-10C engines.\nThe most advanced versions are expected to feature the WS-15 engine, which offers improved thrust, fuel efficiency, and supercruise capability. This is a key feature of fifth-generation fighters, as it enhances both speed and stealth by reducing infrared signatures. The J-20\u2019s top speed is estimated to be between Mach 2.0 and Mach 2.8, depending on the engine configuration, and its climb rate is believed to be around 60,000 feet per minute.\nComparison to Western Fighters\nThe J-20 is vastly different compared to its Western Counterparts. The F-22 Raptor, developed by Lockheed Martin, is widely regarded as the most capable air superiority fighter in the world. It excels in stealth, agility, and dogfighting performance, but it has a shorter combat radius and is no longer in production, with only 187 units built. The F-35, also developed by Lockheed Martin, is a multirole fighter with exceptional sensor fusion, electronic warfare capabilities, and networked operations.\nSome have called the F-35 a flying supercomputer, an apt description considering how sophisticated its internal electronics are. However, it is slower and less maneuverable than both the F-22 and the J-20.\nThe J-20, by contrast, is designed with a different set of priorities. It emphasizes long-range interception, stealth, and electronic warfare over close-range dogfighting. Its extended range and growing production numbers make it a significant force in the region. While it may not yet match the F-22 in terms of raw stealth or agility, it is rapidly evolving and increasingly capable of challenging Western air dominance.\nDesign of the J-20\nThe J-20\u2019s design is a blend of stealth, speed, and long-range capabilities. It features a canard-delta wing configuration, which enhances maneuverability and lift, especially at high altitudes. The aircraft also incorporates diverterless supersonic inlets (DSI), which help reduce radar cross-section while simplifying the intake design. Its fuselage is smoothly blended with the wings, contributing to both aerodynamic efficiency and stealth. The aircraft\u2019s internal weapons bays allow it to carry missiles without compromising its radar signature, and its radar-absorbing materials and coatings further enhance its low observability.\nStealth is a central feature of the J-20\u2019s design, though it is optimized differently compared to its Western counterparts. The aircraft\u2019s radar cross-section (RCS) is estimated to be around 0.027 square meters from the front, which is larger than the F-22\u2019s estimated RCS of 0.01 square meters. While the J-20\u2019s canards may slightly compromise its frontal stealth, they provide aerodynamic benefits that enhance maneuverability and control. The aircraft\u2019s stealth materials are reportedly more durable and easier to maintain than those used on the F-22, which could offer logistical advantages in sustained operations.\nInside One of China\u2019s Most Advanced Fighters\nThe J-20 is equipped with a suite of advanced avionics and sensors. It features an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar with a detection range exceeding 350 kilometers, an electro-optical targeting system (EOTS), and a distributed aperture system (DAS) that provides 360-degree situational awareness. These systems are designed to support long-range detection, tracking, and engagement of enemy aircraft and missiles. The J-20 also includes advanced data-link capabilities, enabling it to operate as part of a networked force and share information with other aircraft, drones, and ground stations in real time.\nIn terms of armament, the J-20 is primarily configured for air superiority missions. It carries long-range PL-15 air-to-air missiles, which are believed to have a range exceeding 200 kilometers, and short-range PL-10E infrared-guided missiles for close combat.\nThese weapons are housed in internal bays to preserve the aircraft\u2019s stealth profile. When stealth is not a priority, the J-20 can also carry additional weapons on external hardpoints. The aircraft\u2019s internal configuration typically allows for four PL-15 missiles and two PL-10E missiles, though this may vary depending on mission requirements.\nSeveral variants of the J-20 have been developed or are in development. The J-20A is the standard production model, while the J-20B includes enhancements such as thrust-vectoring nozzles and the WS-15 engine.\nA twin-seat variant, known as the J-20S, has also been observed. This version is believed to be intended for electronic warfare, training, or as a command platform for coordinating unmanned systems.\nThe addition of a second crew member could significantly expand the aircraft\u2019s operational flexibility.\nAbout the Author:\nIsaac Seitz, a Defense Columnist, graduated from Patrick Henry College\u2019s Strategic Intelligence and National Security program.

      "text": "China's J-20 Has One Major Advantage Over Western Fighter Jets\nThe US, Russia, and China have all developed fifth-generation fighter jets. While the US has developed incredible machines like the F-22 Raptor and the F-35A Lightning \u2014 two of the fastest planes in the US military \u2014 China has also developed its own fifth-generation stealth fighter, the J-20 \"Mighty Dragon.\" The Mighty Dragon is no featherweight, weighing in with a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 81,660 pounds, and boasting a length of 67 feet, with a wingspan of 44 feet. This is similar to the F-22 Raptor, which has a wingspan of 44 feet and 6 inches, is 62 feet in length, and has an MTOW of 83,500. However, it's substantially bigger than the F-35 which has an MTOW in the 70,000-pound class, a wingspan of 35 feet, and a length of 51 feet.\nPrimarily, any advantage the J-20 has isn't about performance; it's about something that China is very good at \u2014 manufacturing. While the consensus remains that fifth-gen Western fighters outperform their Chinese counterpart, the country's ability to turn its manufacturing expertise to military aircraft is a concern, with a production run of over 1,000 aircraft well within the bounds of possibility.\nA manufacturing powerhouse\nChina is a manufacturing powerhouse that has grown from producing 3% of the world's exports in 1995 to 20% in 2020. It's this expertise that's being translated into an impressive ability to manufacture military hardware like the J-20 at scale. However, manufacturing fighter jets is neither cheap nor simple. A point demonstrated by America's F-22 Raptor program, the production of which was shelved due to high costs, with only 187 of the planes reaching operational status. This leaves the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter as the main fifth-generation fighter still produced by the US. The jet was cleared for full-rate production in 2024 \u2014 four years later than planned \u2014 and production is expected to be about 156 aircraft per year.\nWhile the F-35 production rate is likely currently outperforming the J-20 production numbers, there are signs that the Chinese production cycle is on the rise. Pinning down how many J-20s China has is challenging. The plane entered service in 2017, and five years later, there were only an estimated 40 in service. However, by 2024, the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) was thought to have a healthy 195 J-20s at its disposal. Further satellite intelligence suggests that production is now at least 78 planes per year, and is possibly as high as 100 \u2013 120. These numbers are consistent with the widespread belief that the PLAAF is targeting a fleet of over 1,000 J-20s by the 2030s.\nIt's not all down to numbers\nWhile the weight of sheer numbers is undoubtedly advantageous in any conflict situation, it's by no means the only factor. History is scattered with David and Goliath moments. So, while the Chinese may ultimately outproduce the West, factors like tactics, training, technology, and performance all have a bearing to play. Additionally, it is believed that Western fifth-generation fighters like the F-35 have a lower radar cross-section than the J-20.\nIn terms of sheer speed, the J-20 is on a par with the F-22 Raptor, both being rated as being capable of Mach 2. However, this does give it an edge over the F-35 Lightning II, which is rated at a relatively pedestrian Mach 1.6. It also holds a performance edge when considering range. The J-20 is believed to have a range of over 3,700 miles, for comparison the similarly sized F-22 boasts a mere 1,850 miles.\nIt isn't without its flaws, though. The J-20 has a larger radar cross-section when compared to fifth-generation US fighters, making it more susceptible to detection. It also has inferior engines, which are thought to be at least 10 years behind Western engines in terms of technology. The story is similar with avionics. While they are advanced, there are doubts about the efficiency of the system. Of course, the current development of the curiously named sixth-generation F-47 fighter may well also have a bearing to play in the ongoing arms race to maintain air dominance."

      "text": "F-35 Vs J-35: How China's Latest Fighter Jet Compares To The US Navy's Best\nThe fifth generation of fighter jets was developed and deployed in the 21st century and is still going strong, and new planes are still in the works. That includes China's Shenyang J-35 fighter jet (and its land-based variant, the J-35A), which was just unveiled late last year. Considering China's chief economic and political rival is the United States, it's only natural that people immediately began comparing the J-35 to America's own 5th-generation fighter \u2014 the F-35 Lightning II.\nThe F-35 is named after a literal force of nature \u2014 lightning \u2014 and, from a design and technological standpoint, is far from the original World War II-era P-38 Lightning. The U.S. Air Force calls the Lightning II \"the world's most advanced multi-role fighter,\" so China's J-35 has a lot to live up to if it's to be directly compared to the F-35. Thankfully, no conflict thus far has warranted combat between the two aircraft (though China may use mock F-35s for tests and training). The best way to compare the Navy's best fighter jet to China's is by looking at specs and other known features.\nThe F-35 is 51.4 feet long and 14.4 feet tall, with a wingspan of 35 feet. The wings themselves take up 460 square feet, while its horizontal tail span is 22.5 feet. When empty, the jet weighs 29,300 pounds, though it can carry 18,250 lbs of fuel. Less is known about the J-35 since it's still classified, but there are estimates based on observations of the aircraft. The J-35A, which is designed for land-based takeoffs, is believed to be around 56.75 feet long and 15.75 feet tall, with a 37.7-foot wingspan. Based on these measurements, the J-35 is a bit larger than the F-35.\nIs the J-35 faster than the F-35?\nWhen fully loaded, the F-35 has a top speed of Mach 1.6, which equates to 1,200 miles per hour \u2014 earning its Lightning II moniker. The jet has a climb rate of 45,000 feet per minute and can pull up to 9 G's. Its range is more than 1,200 nautical miles, which is a little shorter than the J-35. The J-35's combat radius is estimated to be between 650-810 nautical miles, which is the furthest distance the fighter can reach before having to return to base and refuel. That means its max range could theoretically be 1,620 nautical miles \u2014 significantly further than the F-35. The J-35 is also estimated to be faster than the Lightning II with a top speed of Mach 1.8 \u2014 a difference of 170 mph.\nIt shouldn't be a surprise that the speeds of the two fighters are not identical, as they have very different engine configurations. The F-35 flies with a Pratt & Whitney F135, an afterburning turbofan developed specifically for the jet, equipping it with over 40,000 lbs. of thrust. The J-35A, on the other hand, has previously used not one but two WS-13 engines, though it's been upgraded with twin WS-19 Huangshan engines. The WS-19s are built with omnidirectional thrust vectoring technology and can produce over 10 tons of thrust.\nThe USAF prioritizes stealth, but China may be more interested in dogfight-friendly maneuverability\nNotably, the designs of both fighter jets prioritize stealth, reflecting the importance of surveillance and intelligence in modern warfare. The aerodynamic profiles of both planes are stealth-forward and have a V-like shape, which don't just better deflect radar but also reduce turbulence. However, the J-35A has wider stabilizers less sharply angled than the F-35, so it's possible that China's military strategies and objectives may prioritize agility more than the F-35 does.\nAlso supporting this possibility is the wing design of both aircraft, with the J-35's more angular wings boosting maneuverability and the F-35's smoother and more contoured wings designed to reduce radar reflection and turbulence at high speeds. This allows the fighter to hide and last longer over enemy territory. Also aiding stealth capabilities are the internal munition bays used by both aircraft that keep weapons' signature off radar. Both fighter jets can also carry weapons externally, though. The F-35 has a payload of 18,000 pounds and can utilize a variety of different armaments catered to specific missions, including AIM-120C AMRAAM and AIM-9X Block II air-to-air missiles and JDAM bombs, among other munitions.\nFor the J-35 and other Chinese planes, it's believed that next-generation air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons are being developed, including a folding-tail variant of the PL-15E. The J-35 could feasibly carry six of these more compact missiles internally. Currently, at least 19 nations fly the F-35, including the U.S. and its allies. As the J-35 is a newer plane, China has not sold or shared it with any other military as of yet. But \u2014 no matter where they're taking off or what skies they're patrolling \u2014 both fifth-generation jets can claim to be among the most advanced fighters ever made."

China\u2019s production scale and cost advantage threaten Western air dominance, and the J\u201117\u2019s export success signals growing influence in Pakistan, Myanmar, Nigeria and Azerbaijan. These developments raise strategic concerns for U.S., EU and regional partners, potentially shifting the balance in the Indo\u2011Pacific and Middle East.",
