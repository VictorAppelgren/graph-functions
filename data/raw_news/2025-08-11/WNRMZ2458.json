  "description": "The IAEA is yet to make a statement about the meeting, which will not include a visit to Iranian nuclear sites.",
  "content": "The IAEA is yet to make a statement about the meeting, which will not include a visit to Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nIran\u2019s talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be \u201ctechnical\u201d and \u201ccomplicated\u201d, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said, ahead of a visit by the United Nations nuclear watchdog for the first time since Tehran cut ties with it last month in the wake of the June conflict triggered by Israeli strikes.\n\nEsmaeil Baghaei, Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, told reporters on Monday that a meeting may be organised with Minister of Foreign Affairs Abbas Araghchi during the IAEA\u2019s visit, \u201cbut it is a bit soon to predict what the talks will result since these are technical talks, complicated talks\u201d.\n\nThe IAEA\u2019s visit marks the first to Iran since President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the country on July 3 to suspend its cooperation with the nuclear watchdog after an intensive 12-day war with Israel. The conflict also saw the United States launch massive strikes on Israel\u2019s behalf against key Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nPezeshkian told Al Jazeera in an interview last month that his country is prepared for any future war Israel might wage against it, adding that he was not optimistic about the ceasefire between the countries. He confirmed that Tehran is committed to continuing its nuclear programme for peaceful purposes.\n\nHe added that Israel\u2019s strikes, which assassinated leading military figures and nuclear scientists, damaged nuclear facilities and killed hundreds of civilians, had sought to \u201celiminate\u201d Iran\u2019s hierarchy, but \u201ccompletely failed to do so\u201d.\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi told Iran\u2019s state-run IRNA news agency on Monday that Massimo Aparo, the IAEA\u2019s deputy director general and head of safeguards, had left Iran. Aparo met with an Iranian delegation, which included officials from the Foreign Ministry and the IAEA, to discuss \u201cthe method of interaction between the agency and Iran\u201d.\n\nGharibabadi said they decided to continue consultations in the future, without providing further details.\n\nThe IAEA did not immediately issue a statement about Aparo\u2019s visit, which will not include any planned access to Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nRelations between the IAEA and Iran deteriorated after the watchdog\u2019s board said on June 12 that Iran had breached its non-proliferation obligations, a day before Israel\u2019s air strikes over Iran, which sparked the conflict.\n\nBaghaei, meanwhile, criticised the IAEA\u2019s lack of response to the Israeli strikes.\n\n\u201cPeaceful facilities of a country that was under 24-hour monitoring were the target of strikes, and the agency refrained from showing a wise and rational reaction and did not condemn it as it was required,\u201d he said.\n\nAraghchi had previously said that cooperation with the agency, which will now require approval by Iran\u2019s highest security body, the Supreme National Security Council, would be about redefining how both sides cooperate. The decision will likely further limit inspectors\u2019 ability to track Tehran\u2019s programme that had been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels.\n\nIran has had limited IAEA inspections in the past, in negotiations with the West, and it is unclear how soon talks between Tehran and Washington for a deal over its nuclear programme will resume, if at all.\n\nUS intelligence agencies and the IAEA assessed that Iran last had an organised nuclear weapons programme in 2003. Although Tehran had been enriching uranium up to 60 percent, this is still some way from the weapons-grade levels of 90 percent.",

  "summary": "Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated that its talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be \"technical\" and \"complicated\". This comes ahead of a visit by the U.N. nuclear watchdog, marking the first since Iran cut ties with the IAEA following a conflict triggered by Israeli strikes. The meeting may also include a meeting with Iran's Minister of Finance, Abbas Araghchi, but it is too early to predict the outcome. Relations between the International Association of Safety and Enforcement have deteriorated since the June 12 review of Iran's non-proliferation obligations and Israel's air strikes over Iran. Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi reportedly met with an Iranian delegation to discuss \"the method of interaction between the agency and Iran\".",

      "text": "Iran president signs law suspending cooperation with IAEA\nIran is also considering an entry ban on IAEA chief Rafael Grossi, after rejecting his request to visit nuclear sites.\nIran\u2019s President Masoud Pezeshkian has signed a law suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), amid growing tensions between Tehran and the UN nuclear watchdog following Israeli and US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities last month.\n\u201cMasoud Pezeshkian promulgated the law suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency,\u201d Iranian state TV reported on Wednesday.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 itemsIran \u2018needs more time\u2019 to decide on resuming nuclear talks with US\nIran hardens stance against IAEA and its chief in wake of US-Israel attacks\nThe announcement comes a week after Iran\u2019s parliament passed legislation to suspend cooperation with the IAEA, citing Israel\u2019s June 13 surprise attack on Iran and later strikes by the US on Iranian nuclear facilities.\nAccording to the parliament resolution, IAEA inspectors will not be allowed to visit nuclear sites without approval from Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council.\nDuring a daily briefing, the spokesperson for the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the Iranian decision was \u201cobviously concerning\u201d.\n\u201cI think the secretary-general has been very consistent in his call for Iran to cooperate with the IAEA, and, frankly, for all countries to work closely with the IAEA on nuclear issues,\u201d Stephane Dujarric told reporters.\nIn response to Pezeshkian formally enacting the suspension, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar urged European signatories of the 2015 nuclear deal to trigger the \u201csnapback\u201d mechanism and reinstate all UN sanctions on Iran.\nThe snapback, set to expire in October, was part of the nuclear accord that collapsed after the United States withdrew in 2018. Iran began scaling back commitments a year later.\nUS Department of State spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the suspension was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and that Tehran must cooperate fully with the UN watchdog without further delay.\n\u201cIt is worth repeating, as we\u2019ve made tremendous strides to this through Donald Trump\u2019s leadership, Iran cannot and will not have a nuclear weapon,\u201d she said.\nGermany said Iran\u2019s decision sends a \u201cdisastrous signal\u201d.\n\u201cFor a diplomatic solution, it is essential for Iran to work with the IAEA,\u201d German foreign ministry spokesperson Martin Giese told reporters.\nThe IAEA, in a statement, said it was \u201cawaiting further official information from Iran\u201d.\nGrowing tensions\nSince Israel launched its assault on Iran last month, Tehran has sharply criticised the IAEA.\nIran\u2019s foreign minister earlier this week said IAEA chief Rafael Grossi was no longer welcome in the country.\nOfficials have also criticised Grossi over a June 12 resolution passed by the IAEA board accusing Tehran of non-compliance with its nuclear obligations.\nIranian officials said the resolution was among the \u201cexcuses\u201d for the Israeli attacks that began on June 13 and lasted for 12 days.\nIran has also rejected a request from IAEA chief Grossi to visit nuclear facilities bombed during the war.\n\u201cGrossi\u2019s insistence on visiting the bombed sites under the pretext of safeguards is meaningless and possibly even malign in intent,\u201d said Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on X on Monday. \u201cIran reserves the right to take any steps in defence of its interests, its people and its sovereignty.\u201d\nEarlier this week, Pezeshkian decried Grossi\u2019s \u201cdestructive\u201d conduct, while France, Germany and the United Kingdom have condemned unspecified \u201cthreats\u201d made against the IAEA chief.\nIran\u2019s ultra-conservative Kayhan newspaper recently claimed that documents showed Grossi was an Israeli spy and should be executed.\nIran has insisted no threats were posed against Grossi or the agency\u2019s inspectors.\nThe 12-day war began when Israel carried out a surprise bombardment of Iranian nuclear facilities and military sites and assassinated several top military commanders and nuclear scientists. Tehran responded with waves of missiles and drones at Israel.\nOn June 22, Israel\u2019s ally, the US, launched unprecedented strikes of its own on Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz. A ceasefire between Iran and Israel took hold on June 24.\nAt least 935 people were killed in Israeli attacks on Iran, according to judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir, citing the latest forensic data. The deceased included 132 women and 38 children, Jahangir added.\nIran\u2019s retaliatory attacks killed 28 people in Israel, according to authorities.\nUS President Donald Trump said the US attacks had \u201cobliterated\u201d Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, though the extent of the damage was not clear.\nOn Wednesday, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told journalists that the strikes had set the country\u2019s nuclear programme back by \u201cone to two years at least\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking probably closer to two years,\u201d he said.\nAraghchi has admitted that \u201cserious\u201d damage has been inflicted on nuclear sites.\nBut in a recent interview with US media outlet CBS Evening News, he said: \u201cOne cannot obliterate the technology and science \u2026 through bombings.\u201d\nIsrael and some Western countries say Iran has sought nuclear weapons \u2013 an ambition Tehran has consistently denied."

Ninety percent enrichment is required for a nuclear weapon.\nWestern powers, led by the US and backed by Israel, have long accused Tehran of secretly seeking nuclear weapons.\nIran has repeatedly denied this, insisting its nuclear programme is solely for civilian purposes such as energy production.\nTehran and Washington had held five rounds of nuclear talks starting in April, but a planned meeting on June 15 was cancelled after Israel launched its strikes on Iran."

      "text": "Iran ready for war with Israel, will not halt nuclear programme: Pezeshkian\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera, Iran\u2019s president insists Tehran\u2019s uranium enrichment programme will continue.\nIran\u2019s President Masoud Pezeshkian has said his country is prepared for any war Israel might wage against it, adding he was not optimistic about the ceasefire between the countries, while confirming Tehran is committed to continuing its nuclear programme for peaceful purposes.\nPezeshkian made the comments in an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera aired on Wednesday, one of his first since the end of the 12-day conflict with Israel last month, in which the United States intervened on Israel\u2019s behalf, launching strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.\nThe comments come as Western nations say they are seeking a solution to Iran\u2019s ongoing nuclear ambitions in the wake of the conflict, amid reports that strikes on its nuclear facilities were less damaging than claimed by Washington.\n\u201cWe are fully prepared for any new Israeli military move, and our armed forces are ready to strike deep inside Israel again,\u201d Pezeshkian told Al Jazeera.\nIran was not relying on the ceasefire that ended the 12-day war to hold, he said.\n\u201cWe are not very optimistic about it,\u201d said Pezeshkian.\n\u201cThat is why we have prepared ourselves for any possible scenario and any potential response. Israel has harmed us, and we have also harmed it. It has dealt us powerful blows, and we have struck it hard in its depths, but it is concealing its losses.\u201d\nHe added that Israel\u2019s strikes, which assassinated leading military figures and nuclear scientists, and damaged nuclear facilities, had sought to \u201celiminate\u201d Iran\u2019s hierarchy, \u201cbut it has completely failed to do so\u201d.\nMore than 900 people were killed in Iran, large numbers of them civilians, and at least 28 people were killed in Israel before a ceasefire took hold on June 24.\nEnrichment programme will continue\nPezeshkian said Iran would continue its uranium enrichment programme despite international opposition, saying the development of its nuclear abilities would be carried out \u201cwithin the framework of international laws\u201d.\n\u201c[US President Donald] Trump says that Iran should not have a nuclear weapon and we accept this because we reject nuclear weapons and this is our political, religious, humanitarian and strategic position,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe believe in diplomacy, so any future negotiations must be according to a win-win logic, and we will not accept threats and dictates.\u201d\nHe said the claim from Trump \u201cthat our nuclear programme is over is just an illusion\u201d.\n\u201cOur nuclear capabilities are in the minds of our scientists and not in the facilities,\u201d he said.\nPezeshkian\u2019s comments echoed earlier remarks by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who said in an interview with US broadcaster Fox News aired Monday that Tehran would never abandon its uranium enrichment programme, but was open to a negotiated solution to its nuclear ambitions, in which it would guarantee that the programme was for peaceful purposes in response for the lifting of sanctions.\nIsrael sought to \u2018overthrow\u2019 leadership\nPezeshkian also addressed an attempt by Israel to assassinate him at a meeting of the Supreme National Security Council in Tehran on June 15, which was reported to have left him with minor injuries.\nAsked about the assassination attempt, he said it had been part of a plan by Israeli commanders to target Iran\u2019s political leadership in the wake of its assassination of senior military figures, in a bid \u201cto put the country into chaos in order to overthrow it completely\u201d.\nBut the plan had failed, he said.\nHe also stressed that Tehran\u2019s strikes on Qatar\u2019s Al Udeid base in the wake of US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities had not been an attack on Qatar and its people.\n\u201cWe do not even have a thought or imagination that there should be hostility or rivalry between us and the state of Qatar,\u201d he said, adding that he had called Qatar\u2019s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani on the day of the strikes to explain his position.\n\u201cI say clearly and honestly that we did not attack the State of Qatar, but we attacked a base for America that bombed our country while all our intentions towards Qatar and its people are good and positive.\u201d\nTalks with European powers to resume\nAraghchi said on Monday that Iran\u2019s Atomic Energy Organization is still evaluating how the attacks last month had affected Iran\u2019s enriched material, saying Tehran would soon inform the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of its findings.\nHe said Iran had not stopped cooperation with the IAEA, adding that any request for the IAEA to send inspectors back to Iran would be \u201ccarefully considered\u201d.\nIAEA inspectors left Iran earlier this month after Pezeshkian signed a law suspending cooperation with the agency.\nMeanwhile, talks are set to take place between Iran, France, Germany and the UK in Turkiye on Friday.\nThe three European parties to the former Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which Tehran signed with several world powers in 2015 before the US pulled out in 2018, have said Tehran\u2019s failure to resume negotiations would lead to international sanctions being reimposed on it."

      "text": "Iran holds \u2018frank\u2019 nuclear talks with European powers amid sanctions threat\nDiplomatic meeting in Istanbul between Tehran and E3 countries is first since Israel and US attacked Iran in mid-June.\nIranian diplomats say they held \u201cfrank\u201d nuclear talks with their counterparts from Germany, the United Kingdom and France, as Tehran faces warnings that the three European nations could trigger \u201csnapback\u201d United Nations sanctions against the country.\nThe meeting in the Turkish capital, Istanbul, on Friday was the first since Israel\u2019s mid-June attack on Iran, which led to an intensive 12-day conflict that saw the United States launch strikes against key Iranian nuclear sites.\nIsrael\u2019s offensive also derailed US-Iran nuclear talks that began in April.\nSince then, the European powers, known as the E3, have threatened to trigger a so-called \u201csnapback mechanism\u201d under a moribund 2015 nuclear deal that would reinstate UN sanctions on Iran by the end of August.\nIran\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi, who attended Friday\u2019s talks alongside senior Iranian diplomat Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said after the meeting that the parties held a \u201cserious, frank and detailed\u201d discussion about sanctions relief and the nuclear issue.\n\u201cWhile seriously criticising their stances regarding the recent war of aggression against our people, we explained our principled positions, including on the so-called snapback mechanism,\u201d Gharibabadi said.\n\u201cIt was agreed that consultations on this matter will continue.\u201d\nThe European countries, along with China and Russia, are the remaining parties to the 2015 deal, from which the US unilaterally withdrew in 2018.\nUnder the pact, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran had agreed to curb its nuclear programme in exchange for global sanctions relief.\nIranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said in an earlier interview with state news agency IRNA that Tehran considers talk of extending the UN resolution governing the deal \u2013 Security Council Resolution 2231 \u2013 to be doubly \u201cmeaningless and baseless\u201d.\nThe resolution enshrines the major powers\u2019 prerogative to restore UN sanctions. The option to trigger the snapback expires in October, and Tehran has warned of consequences should the E3 opt to activate it.\nSeparately, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi said on Friday that Iran has indicated it will be ready to restart technical-level discussions on its nuclear programme with the UN nuclear watchdog.\nGrossi said in Singapore that Iran must be transparent about its facilities and activities.\nHe told reporters that the IAEA had proposed that Iran start discussions on \u201cthe modalities as to how to restart or begin [inspections] again\u201d.\n\u201cSo this is what we are planning to do, perhaps starting on technical details and, later on, moving on to high-level consultations. So this will not include inspections yet.\u201d\nIn late June, after the Israeli and US attacks on the country, Iran took an unequivocal stance against the IAEA, with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi summarily dismissing Grossi\u2019s request to visit nuclear facilities that were bombed during the conflict.\n\u201cGrossi\u2019s insistence on visiting the bombed sites under the pretext of safeguards is meaningless and possibly even malign in intent,\u201d Araghchi said at the time.\nUranium enrichment\nIranian diplomats have previously warned that Tehran could withdraw from the global nuclear non-proliferation treaty if UN sanctions are reimposed.\nRestoring the sanctions would deepen Iran\u2019s international isolation and place further pressure on its already strained economy.\nBefore the June conflict, Washington and Tehran were divided over uranium enrichment, which Iran has described as a \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d right for civilian purposes but the US calls a \u201cred line\u201d.\nThe IAEA says Iran is enriching uranium to 60 percent purity \u2013 far above the 3.67 percent cap under the 2015 deal, but well below the 90 percent needed for weapons-grade levels.\nTehran has said it is open to discussing the rate and level of enrichment, but not the right to enrich uranium.\nIran also says it will not abandon its nuclear programme, which Araghchi has called a source of \u201cnational pride\u201d."

  "argos_summary": "Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has indicated that upcoming talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be complex and technical, following a suspension of cooperation due to recent conflicts with Israel. The IAEA's visit marks the first since Iran cut ties with the agency after Israeli strikes on its nuclear facilities. Iran's leadership has reaffirmed its commitment to its nuclear program, asserting it is for peaceful purposes, while also criticizing the IAEA's lack of response to the Israeli attacks.",
