      "feedback": "The draft tracks a plausible Regime A backdrop but fails on cross‑topic synthesis, source discipline, and explicit scenario mechanics; fix by: (1) anchoring the narrative in a formal base/bull/bear scenario structure for a 12–18 month horizon, with clear triggers and invalidation rules (e.g., a Sep-FOMC move of −25 to −50 bp and/or 10Y around mid-4% driving a tangible rerating vs. a hawkish surprise, or an oil supply shock that reaccelerates inflation); (2) tightening the causal chain from macro/policy to flows/positioning to valuation/technicals, with first‑principles links (discount-rate/CFPV math, capex intensity, and sectoral cash‑flow durability) and explicit quantity-tilts (e.g., if 10Y yields move from mid-4% to 4.6–4.8%, what happens to P/E multiples on durable-moat segments like Ford, MSFT/Shopify, UNH/LULU, and Schlumberger); (3) expanding cross‑topic drivers to include the full S&P 500 influences named in sources (Ford ballast; MSFT/Shopify cloud revenue and AI cycles; UNH/LULU defensive cash generation; Schlumberger shareholder-return discipline) and tying each to a directional thesis and a quantifiable impact on ROIC, FCF yield, and multiple; (4) quantifying inputs and outcomes with the numbers you have (Ford: 5% yield and forward P/E ~10.3x; Q2 EV losses ≈ $1.3B; adj. EBIT ≈ 4.3%; ROIC ≈ 10.1%; ACMR: 2025 revenue ~$900m and gross margin ~4%); use these as anchors rather than placeholders, and reconcile any conflicting claims; (5) tightening citations and removing uncited or weakly cited details (the crime vignette and the truncated Intel governance line)—either cite the correct source or omit; ensure every substantive assertion maps to GX057ADL7, J99EM2TPZ, RHXDOHQQX, or 22PL3Q360 and note any conflicts; (6) present a concise watch-list of decisive signals with thresholds: Sep rate path and actual cut magnitude, IEA 2025 supply/demand deltas, tariff-extension outcomes, Ford’s EV-cycle monetization metrics (Q3/Q4), AI‑capex spending data, 10Y yield moves, and FX/dollar trajectory; (7) improve format alignment with SECTION FOCUS by delivering a compact, multi-topic synthesis that makes the direction/sign, mechanism, and fragility explicit, and by keeping the tone consistent with a horizon/style that emphasizes cross‑topic drivers and actionable signals rather than a narrative gloss.",
