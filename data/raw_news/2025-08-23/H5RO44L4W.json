  "content": "With Anthony Volpe now nearing the end of his third big league season, the only thing consistent about his game is the length the Yankees will go to defend it.\n\nAfter going 0-for-3 with a strikeout in Friday\u2019s 1-0 loss to Boston, Volpe \u2014 prone to short-lived highs and prolonged lows \u2014 is now 7-for-his-last-56 (.125). He is hitting .209 with a .679 OPS and an 87 wRC+ on the season, while his career numbers were .211, .667 and 86 entering prior to Friday\u2019s game. Volpe has never had an on-base percentage above .300, and his baserunning and defense have taken serious steps backwards this season.\n\nWith -7 Outs Above Average, the former Gold Glover ranked 22nd out of 25 qualified shortstops entering Friday. His 16 errors ranked 24th.\n\nStill, Aaron Boone called Volpe a \u201cf\u2013king elite\u201d defender earlier this season. Brian Cashman insisted \u201che\u2019s going to be part of the solution, rather than the problem.\u201d\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been much evidence of that so far, but that has not stopped the Yankees from talking about Volpe like he is a star player. Or from treating him like he can do no wrong, even throughout a season full of mistakes.\n\nAnother blunder came in Friday\u2019s game, as did another dubious defense from Boone, Volpe\u2019s staunchest supporter.\n\nWith Volpe having already been booed for striking out in the eighth inning, the shortstop fielded a Ceddanne Rafaela groundball at shortstop with nobody out in the ninth inning. Jarren Duran wandered a bit off second base on the play, prompting Volpe to make a 48.3-mph throw behind the runner in hopes of getting a tag out at second instead of the routine out at first. Instead, Duran beat the short throw back to second, while Rafaela easily beat Jazz Chisholm Jr.\u2019s throw to first.\n\nZero outs were recorded on the play.\n\nWhile the mishap didn\u2019t come back to burn the Yankees \u2014 Volpe ultimately threw Duran out at home plate on a sharp play \u2014 throwing to first was the obvious move. Boone acknowledged that, but he spent far more time excusing Volpe\u2019s decision, which forced closer David Bednar to throw extra pitches.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously not the right play, but it\u2019s a little bit of a heady play too. He almost caught a guy off in scoring position there,\u201d Boone said. \u201cI mean, are we going to really dive into that one a lot? I mean, I get it. He wasn\u2019t out, but it\u2019s kind of a heads-up [play], almost got a guy napping.\u201d\n\nVolpe would have had to throw the ball harder than he did to make the play, but that would have risked firing it past Chisholm.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t throw a rocket over there,\u201d Boone said, adding that Duran affected Chisholm\u2019s throw to first.\n\nEven if good throws had been made all around, the smart play in a tight, much-needed divisional game still would have been for Volpe to get the easy out at first base. Saying so shouldn\u2019t require so many caveats.\n\nAfter all, Jasson Dom\u00ednguez plainly said he made a \u201cmistake,\u201d as the left fielder threw to third on the next play when he had no shot at getting Duran, which allowed Rafaela an easy advance to second. Boone, meanwhile, criticized Austin Wells for getting doubled off first base in the sixth inning on a moderately-hit line drive to shortstop.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t get doubled off there,\u201d Boone said, repeating words he\u2019s used frequently over two months of sloppy Yankees baseball. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing, a bullet to like the second basemen or something where you flinch and they grab you, but across the diamond like that? Even if you flinch at it, you gotta know to sit down. That\u2019s one that we need back.\u201d\n\nBut when it comes to Volpe, there is always a \u201cbut\u201d or a justification that defies the eyes.\n\nThe difference now, compared to earlier in the season, is that the Yankees have a capable alternative in Jos\u00e9 Caballero, as he can handle short and has hit well since being acquired from the Rays. No one is saying he will replace Volpe as the starter \u2014 that is not something the Yankees will consider \u2014 but the team wouldn\u2019t be wrong to give the high-energy utility man more starts at short and Volpe more days off.\n\nIt also wouldn\u2019t have been wrong for Boone to have Giancarlo Stanton pinch-hit for the struggling Volpe in the eighth inning on Friday. Instead, Stanton hit for Ryan McMahon after Volpe struck out on three pitches, chasing a low changeup from Garrett Whitlock.\n\nBoone did consider having Stanton hit for Volpe. However, the manager said he went the way he did because Volpe\u2019s speed had the potential to wreak havoc if he reached base, and because Whitlock is a bit of a reverse splits pitcher.\n\nThe right-handed Whitlock has rather even splits this season and for his career, while Volpe\u2019s .277 on-base percentage was tied for the second-lowest of any qualified hitter entering Friday. The odds of him putting his speed to use were slim.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been swinging great the last week after really getting it going there for a few weeks,\u201d Boone said, referring to a post-All-Star break power surge that Volpe enjoyed. \u201cThese last two days, he\u2019s just missed a couple of pitches that he has hit well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get him going again offensively. But I think he\u2019s in the right frame [of mind].\u201d\n\nBoone has repeatedly praised Volpe\u2019s mindset and attitude, expressing faith that the childhood Yankees fan is built to handle the pressures of New York. And the Yankees love to tout the 24-year-old\u2019s work ethic, which is undoubtedly as strong as that of any player in the team\u2019s clubhouse.\n\nBut Volpe\u2019s work isn\u2019t yielding results. It\u2019s certainly not yielding consistency.\n\nThe excuses, however, have become a regular occurrence.",

  "summary": "The New York Yankees continue to make excuses for Anthony Volpe, who is nearing the end of his third big league season with a 7-for-56 game and is currently hitting.209 with a.679 OPS and an 87 wRC+ on the season, despite ranking 22nd out of 25 qualified shortstops. Volpe's performance and on-base percentage have been significantly downgraded this season. Despite this, Aaron Boone, Brian Cashman, Aaron Cashman and Joe Cashman have continued to praise Volpe as an elite defender and maintain that he is part of the solution, rather than the problem. Another recent incident involved Volpe fielding a Ceddanne Rafaela groundball at shortstop with nobody out in the ninth inning, which led to him making a 48.3-mph throw behind the runner in hopes of getting a tag out at second instead of the routine out at first base. Despite these mistakes, Boone defended Volpe\u2019s decision to throw to first base was an obvious move, while Cashman spent more time excusing him. The Yankees are considering replacing Volpe with Jos\u00e9 Cabero, who has hit well and can handle the pressure.",
