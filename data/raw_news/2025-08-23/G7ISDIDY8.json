  "content": "The rescue of an experienced mountaineer has been called off in Kyrgyzstan nearly two weeks after Natasha Nagovitsina, 47, broke her leg not far from the summit of the country\u2019s tallest mountain, according to reports.\n\nNagovitsina, a Russian climber who garnered fame four years ago after she refused to leave her husband after he suffered a stroke, has been stuck at 22,965 feet on Victory Peak since Aug. 12, according to the Daily Mail. Despite her efforts, her husband died.\n\nThe summit of Victory Peak, in the Tian Shan Mountain Range on the border with China, is 24,406 feet. Mount Everest, the world's tallest peak, is 29,032 feet.\n\nThe suspension of the rescue mission comes days after an Italian climber named Luca Sinigaglia died while attempting to help Nagovitsina, Italian newspaper, L\u2019Unione Sarda, reported.\n\nSinigaglia died of hypothermia on Aug. 15, after making it up to where Nagovitsina was stuck, giving her a tent, sleeping bag, food, water and a gas cooker, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nOther attempts to save her both via climbing and twice with a helicopter have failed, including an effort in a defense ministry helicopter that crashed. The crash left four injured, according to the London Times.\n\nTRAGEDY STRIKES AT POPULAR NATIONAL PARK AS CLIMBER MEETS FATAL END ON MOUNTAIN\n\nThe final attempt to rescue Nagovitsina was abandoned some 3,000 feet below where she is after the weather took a turn for the worse.\n\nRescue leader Dmitry Grekov said he didn\u2019t think Nagovitsina could still be alive, according to the Daily Mail.\n\n\"I think not, because she has been there since 12 August - count how much time has passed,\" he said. \"It is unrealistic. It is unrealistic to survive at such an altitude.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA drone that flew over where she was sheltering confirmed she was alive as of Tuesday, but there was no sign of life when the drone flew over on Thursday as temperatures sunk as low as minus 9 degrees Fahrenheit, The Times reported.",

His body has never been found.\n'A year later Natalia once again went to Khan Tengri to install a plaque in memory of her husband.\n'But no one in the new group had any idea what this courageous woman had lived through on that summit a year earlier \u2013 a woman who showed the whole world what love and self-sacrifice mean.'\nHis body was never found."

She said cotton is not the best to wear during hiking because the material is absorbant to sweat.\nShe noted that on Friday, it was raining intermittently, causing the 55-year-old to succumb to the elements and suffer from severe hypothermia.\n\"The White Mountains can be pretty unforgiving,\" she said. \"Weather changes here in a flash.\" Photos from the scene of the rescue captured the misty environment and steep rocky terrain.\nNew Hampshire Fish and Game Department conservation officers, along with volunteers from Androscoggin Valley Search and Rescue, Pemigewassett Valley Search and Rescue, Mountain Rescue Service and personnel from the Mount Washington Cog Railway, mounted a complex response in severe alpine conditions to rescue Wilson.\nDespite a heat wave sweeping cities from Boston to Baltimore, conditions above 5,000 feet in the White Mountains were anything but warm. On the summit of Mount Washington on Friday, temperatures hovered around 20 degrees Fahrenheit, with wind speeds reaching 120 mph and dense cloud cover reducing visibility.\nHIKER FOUND DEAD IN MAINE, SEARCH CONTINUES FOR 28-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER\nSeveral hikers in the region were reported suffering from hypothermia throughout the day, the department noted.\nThe Cog Railway played a crucial role in the rescue operation, transporting rescue teams up the mountain and sparing them a grueling three-mile ascent via the Jewell Trail, the department said.\nThe first rescue team reached the ridgeline at 7 p.m., with a second team arriving an hour later. Rescuers battled high winds and cold as they built a temporary shelter to stabilize Wilson before carrying her back to the waiting train.\nUpon arrival at the base station, Wilson was handed over to a Twin Mountain ambulance crew and transported to Littleton Regional Healthcare for further treatment, the department said.\nOfficials credited the successful outcome to the tireless efforts of rescue volunteers and the Cog Railway\u2019s continued support in emergency efforts.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"The weather was not great and the conditions were potentially life-threatening,\" a department said, \"but each group responded to the call for assistance and endured less-than-hospitable weather conditions to save the life of this hiker.\""
