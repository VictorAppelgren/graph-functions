Use a concise arrow diagram in prose (e.g., “Verdict → ↑ legal‑risk premium → ↓ Tesla → ↓ Nasdaq”).  \n3. **Quantify Key Levels** – State precise support/resistance: “Tesla at $346; break below $340 likely triggers a 0.5–1 % Nasdaq slide.”  \n4. **Define Horizon & Catalysts** – Clearly mark the 0–3 week window: “Immediate catalyst: verdict on 29 Aug; secondary catalyst: Fed’s 25‑bp cut signal on 16–17 Sep.”  \n5. **State Invalidation Triggers** – “If appeal overturns award or NHTSA lifts scrutiny, Tesla could rebound 1–2 %.”  \n6. **Highlight Monitoring Points** – “Watch appellate decision (29 Aug–1 Sep), NHTSA updates (ongoing), and Fed policy path (16–17 Sep).”  \n7. **Remove Non‑Tesla Content** – Trim references to broader indices unless they serve as a transmission channel; keep focus tight on Tesla.  \n8. **Avoid Generic Language** – Replace “market sentiment has already reflected that risk” with specific index moves and percentage changes.  \n\nImplement these edits to meet the “Truth > verbosity” rule, ensure every claim is evidence‑backed, and keep the analysis concise, actionable, and fully aligned with the 0–3 week horizon.",
