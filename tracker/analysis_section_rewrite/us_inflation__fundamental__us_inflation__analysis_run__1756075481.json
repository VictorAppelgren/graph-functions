      "feedback": "The piece would be substantially stronger if you (a) formalize a four-regime, multi-year macro framework anchored in first principles (productivity from AI, policy reaction functions, real-rate differentials, and potential BoP/net external position effects) and then map each regime to regime-specific transmission channels to market pricing; define explicit regime triggers (e.g., productivity surprises, policy announcements on UBI or support, EV profitability milestones, wage/inflation surprises) and clearly state what would invalidate the base case (NL5YYTLF2, 22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW); (b) attach every empirical claim to a source ID and use precise numbers from the sources to bound the analysis (e.g., 25% of US employment at high automation risk; Finland’s UBI outcome; O’Leary’s 15% savings and Chanel-suit durability; Ford’s 17% YTD gain, ~5.2% dividend yield, 4.3% EBIT margin, and EV losses); (c) tighten the causal chain from AI-driven productivity to household balance sheets and asset pricing: AI-driven productivity uplift affects capex and profits, which feeds equity/risk premia and durable-goods demand, which in turn affects household savings, balance-sheet composition, and valuation multiples; explicitly spell out how policy design (UBI vs employment incentives) shifts labor supply, consumption, and risk premia; (d) expand the horizon treatment to include invariant anchors (real-rate differentials, terms-of-trade, productivity, ROIC/WACC discipline, current account trajectories) and show how they translate into asset prices under each regime, not just narrative assertions; (e) recast the Ford example as a cross-section test of the regime framework (Ford’s 17% 2025 gain; 5.18% dividend yield; EV losses; EV ramp timing) and reconcile it with the broader outlook (22PL3Q360); (f) improve consistency across sources by noting any conflicts (e.g., Robinhood/retail-ownership vs macro downside risks) and presenting a reconciled view with explicit probabilities or confidence bands; (g) enhance the structure for clarity while preserving a compact format: a base case, explicit regime definitions with transition conditions, the transmission logic, key catalysts and invalidate signals, and a concise watchlist with numeric thresholds (cite IDs after each factual assertion: NL5YYTLF2 for automation risk and UBI psychology; 1GVYF2V8O and 2QRLB974F for O’Leary’s rules; NL5YYTLF2 and 22PL3Q360 for productivity/policy links; W2622L6WW and 22PL3Q360 for Ford specifics); (h) avoid overreliance on single anecdotes; balance with cross-source checks to ensure coverage of the critical sources you listed. In practice, implement these edits by inserting a regime table-like flow within the paragraph (without formatting) that uses precise numbers from NL5YYTLF2, 1GVYF2V8O, 2QRLB974F, 22PL3Q360, and W2622L6WW to define base-case drivers, triggers, and invalidation cases, then conclude with a crisp “base case, key risks, what to watch, confidence” synthesis; and explicitly tag each assertion with the appropriate source IDs to meet the citation-density requirement.",
