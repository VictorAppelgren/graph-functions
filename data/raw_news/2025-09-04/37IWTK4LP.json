Yomiuri Giants star Kazuma Okamoto, another big-hitting third baseman/first baseman who\u2019s comped to Seiya Suzuki, and Seibu Lions pitching star Tatsuya Imai, who has a 1.50 ERA and throws 98 mph with a plus slider, are being posted, too, sources say.\n\nMets president of baseball operations David Stearns scouted in Japan, and some rivals are speculating the Mets may play for Murakami if they can\u2019t re-sign Pete Alonso. Stearns saw Imai, a 27-year-old right-hander, and Okamoto, as well.\n\nThe latest best guess heard for Aaron Judge\u2019s return to right field is this home stand, maybe early next week. (But of course, many guesses have been made already.)\n\nThe Judge-Cal Raleigh MVP debate is great, but if the Mariners continue flopping (and four teams are within three games for the final wild-card spot), his first-place case goes away.",

We\u2019ve been inconsistent,\u201d Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said before the latest debacle vs. the Marlins, a 5-1 defeat, in what qualifies as a fair if somewhat understated summary of a season that could go either way and at any moment."

      "text": "The Astros are said to be considering a run at Pete Alonso as a surprise suitor in free agency. The all-time Mets home run champion has talked about how he\u2019d love to stay a Met, but his free agency should go better this time around \u2014 not only because he\u2019s ineligible to receive a qualifying offer, but also because he\u2019s having a much better season this year than last.\nAlonso, who\u2019ll surely opt out of the $24 million remaining for 2026, should draw much more interest this time around considering his improved clutch and overall hitting (29 HR, 106 RBI, .265) in a year when he\u2019s said to be \u201cconcentrating on contact.\u201d\nThe Astros would be a surprise because they signed Christian Walker to a three-year, $60M deal last winter, but they continue to show their willingness to spend to win, with the trade for Carlos Correa the latest example. The Mets will try to bring back Alonso, who could draw interest from Texas, Boston, Seattle, the Yankees and others.\nDon\u2019t look now, but the favored Dodgers have their whole rotation back together, and it\u2019s thriving. They won the 2024 World Series with a makeshift, three-man rotation of Yoshinobu Yamamoto, a surgically-repaired Walker Buehler and short-timer Jack Flaherty. But now Yamamoto, Blake Snell, Tyler Glasnow, Shohei Ohtani and a rejuvenated Clayton Kershaw (5-0, 1.88 ERA in August) are all healthy and pitching well. Roki Sasaki is still rehabbing in the minors, but he\u2019s back throwing 99 mph."

The Mets are considering acquiring Murakami to fill a potential gap left by Pete Alonso if they cannot re-sign him. Meanwhile, Alonso\u2019s free\u2011agency prospects are attracting interest from teams like the Astros, who may pursue him after a strong season.
