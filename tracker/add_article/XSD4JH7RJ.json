      "summary": "Romania is home to the largest population of brown bears in Europe outside Russia, with estimates between 10,000 and 13,000. However, a hunting moratorium since 2016 has led to rising bear populations and increased human-bear conflicts, resulting in 20 fatalities since then. Rukmini Callimachi, a reporter for The New York Times, explores this complex relationship in her recent article, highlighting the cultural significance of bears in Romania and the challenges posed by their growing numbers.",
