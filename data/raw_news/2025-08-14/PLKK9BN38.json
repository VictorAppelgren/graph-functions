  "content": "Department of Homeland Security agents joined Metropolitan Police Department officers as they conducted traffic checks at a checkpoint in Washington on Wednesday. The chief of the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington issued an order on Thursday permitting officers to share information about people not in custody, such as those detained during traffic stops, and to provide transportation to federal immigration authorities and their detainees. The directive from Chief Pamela A. Smith, which was reviewed by The New York Times, came as the Trump administration asserted temporary control of the police force, and as a top federal official proclaimed the end of Washington\u2019s status as a sanctuary city. The change effectively serves as a limited carve-out to how the department enforces a broader ban that prohibits the local police from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. Chief Smith\u2019s order on Thursday emphasized that the law remained in place, noting that members of the police department still cannot arrest people solely on immigration charges or hold them in custody at the request of federal officials, if they would have otherwise been released. The order comes as the local police conduct joint patrols with federal agents as part of President Trump\u2019s takeover of law enforcement in the nation\u2019s capital. The president\u2019s border czar said this week that the deployment of federal law enforcement across Washington would effectively negate local laws that limit cooperation with deportation efforts. \u201cD.C. under federal control is not going to be a sanctuary city,\u201d the official, Tom Homan, said on \u201cFox News\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re working with the police hand in hand: When we encounter a criminal illegal alien, they\u2019ll be turned over to ICE, and that\u2019s the way it should be,\u201d he added, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Kash Patel, the F.B.I. director, said on social media on Thursday that federal law enforcement agencies had made 45 arrests during their stepped-up overnight patrols in the city. Of those, 29 were \u201cimmigration-related,\u201d he said. The F.B.I. did not immediately respond to a request to clarify the status of the 29 people, and what \u201cimmigration-related\u201d arrests entailed. The Metropolitan Police Department also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington declined to comment on what had prompted Chief Smith\u2019s order, and on its implications for the city. Under Washington\u2019s sanctuary city law, known as the Sanctuary Values Amendment Act of 2020, local police officers are not permitted to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement authorities by handing over anyone in their custody or by giving them access to detention spaces, except when a federal criminal charge is involved. The law does not explicitly mention transportation or vehicles, which Chief Smith\u2019s order indicated could now be used for federal officials and detainees. The executive order also states that local police officers are permitted to share information only about people who have not been taken into custody. The rest of the order focuses on what the police are not permitted to do, restating many of the provisions in the sanctuary city law. Officers are not allowed to search databases solely for information about a person\u2019s immigration status, or ask about their status for the purpose of helping with a deportation. They are also not allowed to arrest people solely because of a federal immigration warrant against them. And they cannot give federal officials identifying information or the ability to question those in local police custody. D.C. officers are not allowed to hold a person in custody at the request of a federal official, the order stated. Yet the concessions in the order reflected the increasing pressure on city officials from Mr. Trump as he tries to broaden his immigration crackdown. Earlier this year, the House also voted to repeal Washington\u2019s sanctuary city law and force full cooperation with federal authorities. The Senate has not yet taken up the legislation.\n\nThe Kremlin is seeking to weave trade and arms control into the Trump-Putin talks. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in a photo released by Russian state media on Thursday. He told officials that he hoped to discuss \u201cstrategic offensive arms control.\u201d A day ahead of the meeting between President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the Kremlin on Thursday signaled that apart from Ukraine, it was also interested in discussing other subjects, like economic links and nuclear arms. Remarks by Mr. Putin and his foreign policy aide highlighted how, when dealing with Washington, Moscow has tried to dilute discussions about ending the fighting in Ukraine by packaging them together with other bilateral issues. In particular, Russia has focused on the prospect of discussing arms control and restoring economic ties with the United States. On Thursday, Mr. Putin convened top officials at the Kremlin to brief them about the next day\u2019s meeting. In his opening remarks, Mr. Putin said he believed that the United States was making \u201cquite energetic efforts to stop the fighting, end the crisis, and reach agreements of interest to all parties involved in this conflict.\u201d He added that an agreement on Ukraine \u201cwould create long-term conditions of peace between our countries, in Europe, and in the world as a whole, if we reach agreements in the next stages in the field of strategic offensive arms control.\u201d Because of increased hostility between the two countries and the power disparity after the Soviet collapse, the arms-control regime that anchored relations between Moscow and Washington during the Cold War has significantly weakened. At the beginning of August, Russia said that it would no longer abide by a defunct treaty prohibiting the deployment of intermediate-range missiles. The nuclear arms reduction treaty, signed in 2011 during a brief thaw between the two countries, is set to expire next February. Earlier on Thursday, Yuri Ushakov, Mr. Putin\u2019s foreign policy aide, briefed reporters about Russia\u2019s preparations for the meeting. He said it was \u201cobvious to everyone that the central topic will be the settlement of the Ukraine crisis.\u201d \u201cBuf, of course broader issues of ensuring peace and security, as well as current and most pressing international and regional issues, will also be touched upon,\u201d Mr. Ushakov said. \u201cAn exchange of views is expected on the further development of bilateral cooperation, including in the trade and economic sphere,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI would like to note that this cooperation has a huge and, unfortunately, untapped potential.\u201d Trade between Russia and Ukraine has never been significant for the two countries\u2019 economies and has been reduced to minuscule numbers over the past years. But the countries have cooperated in sensitive fields like oil extraction and the aerospace industry. Mr. Ushakov also announced which Russian officials would be part of the delegation at the meeting. The list included Mr. Ushakov himself, alongside Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, but also the finance minister, Anton Siluanov; Kirill Dmitriev, Mr. Putin\u2019s envoy on foreign investment and economic cooperation; and the defense minister, Andrei Belousov. The inclusion of Mr. Belousov and Mr. Dmitriev in the Russian delegation was another indication that the Kremlin hoped to discuss economic matters at the summit. Over the past months, the Kremlin has been highlighting the different Russian and U.S. approaches to ending the fighting in Ukraine. In June, Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, said that Russia wanted to discuss relations with the United States separately from efforts to end the war in Ukraine, but that the Americans wanted to discuss the situation in Ukraine first. As talks linger, Russia and Ukraine continue to exchange drone strikes. On Thursday, Ukrainian drones hit two Russian cities, injuring at least 17 people, according to local officials. A drone struck apartment buildings in Rostov-on-Don, injuring 13 people, the acting regional governor said. At least four civilians were injured in the Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine, according to the local governor.\n\nAhead of Putin meeting, Trump shrugs off Russian threats in U.S. and abroad. A residential building in Kyiv destroyed by a Russian missile last month. Oksana Parafeniuk for The New York Times President Trump on Wednesday suggested that he was powerless to control President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ahead of a planned meeting on Friday in Alaska, saying he could not convince the Russians to stop killing Ukrainian civilians or hacking American court records. Mr. Trump did warn of \u201csevere consequences\u201d if Mr. Putin did not agree to abandon his grueling invasion of Ukraine during their discussion, scheduled to be held at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage. But Mr. Trump was dismissive when asked to address matters of national security and the horrors of war, raising questions about whether he has the leverage or the will to convince Mr. Putin to end the invasion. Asked whether he could convince Mr. Putin to stop targeting civilians, Mr. Trump said that it was a discussion he had already had with Mr. Putin. Russian forces have pounded Ukrainians with drones and missiles, sending civilians scrambling for shelter. Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin have spoken at least five times since Mr. Trump was sworn in for a second term in January, and Russian forces have pushed forward all the while. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of good conversations with him,\u201d Mr. Trump told a reporter during an appearance at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington \u2014 one that was originally about announcing this year\u2019s class of Kennedy Center honorees. \u201cThen I go home and I see that a rocket hit a nursing home, or a rocket hit an apartment building and people are laying dead in the street. So I guess the answer to that is no, because I\u2019ve had this conversation.\u201d Mr. Trump struck a similar tone when asked if he had seen reporting in The New York Times on Tuesday that Russia was behind a widespread breach of federal court systems. The system that was exposed holds highly sensitive records with information that could reveal sources and people charged with national security crimes. \u201cAre you surprised? You know?\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they do. They\u2019re good at it. We\u2019re good at it. We\u2019re actually better at it.\u201d He was also asked if he planned to bring up the reporting with Mr. Putin, but did not answer. Mr. Trump has long bragged about his ability to make deals and use tough talk to get his way, but his relative softness toward Mr. Putin has long perplexed analysts. Some view the latest meeting as a haphazardly planned get-together that risks damaging American interests and blunting the power of the presidency, if Mr. Trump returns to Washington empty-handed. \u201cHis rhetorical posture is completely acquiescent,\u201d said Michael A. McFaul, a former ambassador to Russia under President Barack Obama. \u201cThe risk is that it makes the leader of the United States of America, the most powerful person in the world, look weak.\u201d When he has spoken of helping end the war, Mr. Trump has so far repeated proposals floated by the Russians, such as a swap of territory that could include the entire eastern region known as the Donbas, an idea already flatly rejected by President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he had held a call with European leaders, including Mr. Zelensky, and that the Ukrainian president would be included in a quick follow-up meeting if everything went well. But even on that point, Mr. Trump doubled back. \u201cNow there may be no second meeting,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBecause if I feel that it\u2019s not appropriate to have it, because I didn\u2019t get the answers that we have to have, then we\u2019re not going to have a second meeting.\u201d Fiona Hill, who served as senior director for European and Russian affairs in the National Security Council during Mr. Trump\u2019s first term, said that Mr. Trump was not the only leader taking a risk by taking the meeting. Mr. Putin\u2019s campaign against Ukraine has extended far longer than he anticipated, a miscalculation that has chipped away at the idea that he is a grand strategist, Ms. Hill said. There is the risk, she added, that Mr. Trump again loses patience with the peacemaking process, as he has in recent weeks. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re getting there, where that view of Putin is going to shift,\u201d Ms. Hill said of Mr. Trump. \u201cAnd that is dangerous for Putin.\u201d Still, without Mr. Zelensky present, the conditions of the coming meeting favor Mr. Putin, who had issued the invitation to Mr. Trump to meet. Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessor, Joseph R. Biden Jr., viewed Mr. Putin a \u201cwar criminal,\u201d issuing sanctions meant to cripple the finances of the Russian leader and those around him. But on Friday, Mr. Trump will fly across the country to welcome Mr. Putin to an American military base to see what he has in mind. That laid-back approach \u2014 Mr. Trump earlier this week described it as a \u201cfeel-out meeting\u201d \u2014 seemed to conflict with his threat that Mr. Putin may actually face consequences if he does not agree to end the war. Since Mr. Trump took office, many of the U.S. sanctions levied against Russia have weakened, and Mr. Trump did not say on Wednesday if he would strengthen them or come up with something else. Asked if there would be consequences if Mr. Putin did not take steps to end the war, Mr. Trump answered: \u201cThere will be consequences. I don\u2019t have to say. There will be very severe consequences.\u201d Much of the leverage Mr. Trump could have used with Mr. Putin might have come in the weeks leading up to the meeting, said Steven Pifer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton. Mr. Trump had expressed public frustration over Mr. Putin\u2019s ignoring his calls to halt his offensive against the Ukrainians. But so far, none of the threats have materialized into the kind of punishments that could force Mr. Putin to change course. Mr. Trump could have chosen to divert some $300 billion of frozen Russian central bank assets to Ukraine, Mr. Pifer said, or could have prioritized the production and shipment of American weapons purchased by the Europeans to maximize quick assistance to Kyiv. Mr. Trump has done none of those things, instead wondering aloud if \u201ctariffs and stuff\u201d might be the solution. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get Putin to change course until he concludes he cannot achieve his goals on the battlefield,\u201d Mr. Pifer said. \u201cHad Trump wisely used that leverage and persuaded Putin that this would start happening, he would have dealt himself some cards.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s who Trump picked for the Kennedy Center Honors. Sylvester Stallone, one of the five Kennedy Center honorees announced by President Trump on Wednesday, during a gala at Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., in November. Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times The five Kennedy Center honorees announced by President Trump on Wednesday hail from a typically broad spectrum of the arts: popular musical genres, the Broadway stage and blockbuster Hollywood films. President Trump\u2019s list of recipients included the country music artist George Strait, the disco queen Gloria Gaynor and the rock band Kiss as his musical honorees. He rounded out his list with two actors: Michael Crawford, an Englishman decorated for his stage performances in musicals like \u201cPhantom of the Opera,\u201d and Sylvester Stallone, the American action actor best known for portraying the boxer Rocky Balboa in a series of eponymous films and the mercenary warrior John Rambo in another box-office franchise. Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement, which he made from the Kennedy Center, is his first since he purged the renowned concert venue of its Biden-appointed board members, fired the center\u2019s president and made himself chairman. It revealed his growing influence over the center and its programs as well as his veto power over the list of honorees. He had personally approved each of the recipients, he said, and rejected several other suggested artists because they were \u201cwokesters.\u201d But while some of this year\u2019s recipients have expressed support for Mr. Trump, the list doesn\u2019t read like a blatantly political roster. Mr. Strait, who was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2006, is credited with helping to bring country music back to a more traditional sound, at a time when the genre was gravitating toward pop influence. Mr. Strait, a Texan, looks as well as sounds the part of a country music legend, having preferred a signature urban cowboy style since his first breakout hits in the 1980s. In the decades since, he has enjoyed remarkable success, racking up 60 No. 1 hit songs on the country charts \u2014 the most of any artist in any genre. Ms. Gaynor, who was inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame in 2005, is one of the most recognizable voices of the disco movement that peaked in the United States during the 1970s. Her popularity, however, has far outlasted that era, thanks to the lasting commercial success of her biggest hit, \u201cI Will Survive\u201d \u2014 which also seems to be a personal favorite of Mr. Trump\u2019s. \u201cUnbelievable song,\u201d Mr. Trump quipped during his announcement, adding that \u201cit\u2019s one of those few that get better every time you hear it.\u201d The song is so recognizable and popular that it has occasionally been repurposed as an anti-Trump anthem, including in 2017, when celebrities recorded themselves singing it in anticipation of Mr. Trump\u2019s first inauguration. Kiss, known beyond its fan base for its members\u2019 face paint, elaborate costumes and stage performances that feature theatrics and pyrotechnics, has had its style alternatively described as hard rock, heavy metal, glam rock and glam metal. Regardless of classification, the group, which formed in the 1970s, had a huge influence on bands that followed, helping to popularize grandiose live performances. Kiss, which continues to enjoy significant commercial success and crossover appeal, was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014. Mr. Crawford might not be a household name in the United States, but the decorated British stage actor has originated and popularized a series of iconic roles in musical theater. He was the original Phantom in Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d when it premiered in London, and won a Tony Award for the role after it moved to Broadway. Long before that, he sang the role of Cornelius Hackl in the 1969 film version of \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d starring Barbra Streisand. \u201cI think he\u2019s one of the greatest talents I\u2019ve ever actually seen,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Crawford on Wednesday. For many moviegoers, Mr. Stallone\u2019s visage is synonymous with title roles he popularized in two franchises that produced multiple films and more than $1 billion in revenue: Rocky, about a hapless Philadelphia boxer who becomes the heavyweight champion, and Rambo, about an Army special forces veteran of the Vietnam War who fights bad guys, including corrupt cops. In addition to his film credentials, Mr. Stallone is a stalwart supporter of Mr. Trump, whom he called \u201cthe second George Washington\u201d shortly after his election in November. Mr. Trump has also designated Mr. Stallone one of three \u201cspecial ambassadors\u201d to Hollywood, tasked with bringing film production that has been taking place overseas to the United States.",

  "summary": "The chief of the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, Pamela A. Smith, has issued an order allowing officers to share information about people not in custody and provide transportation to federal immigration authorities and detainees. This move comes as the Trump administration takes temporary control of the police force and declares the end of Washington's status as a sanctuary city. The order effectively provides a limited carve-out to the department's broader ban on cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. However, it remains clear that the sanctuary city law remains in place. The F.B.I. director, Kash Patel, reported that federal law enforcement agencies had made 45 arrests during their stepped-up overnight patrols in the city, 29 of which were \"immigration-related\". The order also stated that local police officers are not allowed to search databases solely for information about a person\u2019s immigration status, or ask about their status for the purpose of helping with a deportation.",
  "shortSummary": "The Trump administration's temporary control of Washington's police force ends Washington's sanctuary city status, allowing officers to share information and transportation information with federal immigration officials.",

I covered President Trump's first term and President Biden\u2019s term.\nI am drawn to stories that give readers a better understanding of the inner lives of presidents and the people around them \u2014 how a key event, a shared history or a past failure can inform the decisions of the most powerful people in the world. That curiosity has driven my coverage across a range of stories, from foreign policy to the complicated dynamics of first families.\nMy Background\nI joined The Times in 2014 as a reporter covering breaking news. Before that, I worked at The Guardian, The Washington Post and at my hometown paper in Elkhart, Ind. I graduated from Loyola University Chicago and have a master\u2019s degree from Northwestern.\nI am the author of \u201cAmerican Woman: The Transformation of the Modern First Lady, from Hillary Clinton to Jill Biden.\u201d\nJournalistic Ethics\nMaintaining journalistic independence is important for every journalist at The Times, which has an extensive ethics policy.\nI want all of my work to be accurate and fair, and I make every effort to understand a story from multiple viewpoints. I protect my sources and work hard to build and keep their trust.\nI do not accept gifts, money or favors from anyone who might figure into my reporting. I do not participate in politics, nor do I make political donations. When I am working, I always identify myself as a reporter for The Times.\nContact Me"

I report on breaking news and other developments inside the Trump administration \u2014 appointments, policy announcements and presidential proclamations on social media. I also help with live coverage of major news events, such as the inauguration and the State of the Union address.\nMy Background\nI joined The Times in 2019, starting as a news assistant in Washington. As a jack-of-all-trades reporting assistant, I helped cover almost every major story in the capital for nearly five years \u2014 beginning with the government shutdown in January 2019 and ending with the ouster of Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House. I traveled to Berlin in 2022 for an international reporting fellowship covering the war in Ukraine, as well as German-Chinese relations.\nI then moved to the Politics desk to report on the 2024 election season. I covered the presidential primaries, focusing on the campaigns of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Donald J. Trump. I spent nearly four months following JD Vance on the campaign trail after he was selected as Trump\u2019s vice-presidential running mate. I moved back to Washington after Trump\u2019s win in November.\nBefore joining The Times, I worked for The Wall Street Journal in 2019 as an international reporting fellow in Hong Kong, covering the videogame industry in Asia.\nI\u2019m a native of Antigua & Barbuda and a graduate of the School of Journalism at Stony Brook University. I became a naturalized American in 2019 and was sworn in by Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, now a justice of the United States Supreme Court.\nJournalistic Ethics\nEvery journalist at The Times keeps to the same standards of fairness and accuracy outlined in our Ethical Journalism Handbook. I do not make political donations, nor do I campaign for causes or take part in political activity like rallies or petitions.\nTransparency is important to success in this job. I always identify myself when reporting, including at events, and I explain the reporting process to anyone unfamiliar with it. When I travel to cover a candidate, The Times pays for my travel. I am open to criticism in good faith. If I make a mistake, I acknowledge and correct it in accordance with Times policy.\nCity officials and advocates spent much of the day trying to clear the city\u2019s dozens of homeless camps, urging people to go to shelters ahead of expected federal raids.\nThe Trump administration had been withholding $239 million in congressionally appropriated funding from the National Endowment for Democracy when the group sued in March.\nThe president has railed against crime in urban, largely liberal cities for decades, but Monday\u2019s announcement was an extraordinary exertion of federal power over an American city.\nThe deployment follows President Trump\u2019s effort to portray the nation\u2019s capital as rife with violent crime, despite data showing crime rates dropping significantly.\nA famously liberal circuit court ruled in President Trump\u2019s favor, authorizing a component of his sweeping effort to assert more control over the federal bureaucracy."

      "text": "Trump once again threatens DC 'takeover' after signing order to crack down on homelessness\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is touting a new executive order as he says his administration\u2019s got a better way to handle homelessness across the country.\nOn Friday, he made an example of D.C. to try to make his point.\nWhat he's saying:\nTrump told reporters that he\u2019s sick and tired of seeing tents full of people in front of the White House.\nHe believes his new executive order will help homeless people get the care they need and also make city streets safer.\nBefore Trump for Scotland Friday, he once again threatened to take over D.C.\nRELATED: DC's Mayor responds to Trump's takeover comments\n\"We\u2019ve got to get the mayor to run this city properly,\" he said. \"This city has to be run. I have the right to take it over.\"\nThe president\u2013this time\u2013was musing a federal takeover of the District because of how it handles homelessness.\nTrump said he\u2019d remove encampments by the White House and complained to reporters about their optics.\n\"When leaders come to see me to make a trade deal for billions and billions and trillions of dollars and they come in and they see tents, we can\u2019t have that. It doesn't sound nice, but can't have that,\" he said.\nBig picture view:\nTrump\u2019s remarks come just one day after he signed an executive order to make it easier for cities and states across the country to remove homeless people off the streets and put them into institutional treatment centers in certain instances, encouraging the use of involuntary civil commitment.\n\"We can\u2019t do that--especially in Washington D.C. I talk to the mayor about it all the time. I say, \u2018you\u2019ve got to get rid of the tents, we can\u2019t have it,\u2019\" Trump said.\nThe White House said its new approach will restore public order. It directs federal support to programs focused on rehab and treatment and prioritizes giving grant money to cities and states that crack down on camping, loitering and squatting.\nLocal activists, however, say this order won\u2019t help the homeless at all.\nWhat they're saying:\n\"I cannot emphasize enough how damaging this order is,\" said Jesse Rabinowitz, who works for the D.C.-based National Homelessness Law Center.\nHe said institutionalization does not work.\n\"Ethically and effectively, forced treatment doesn\u2019t work,\" Rabinowitz said. \"This executive order doesn\u2019t do any of that. All it does is make it easier to punish people and institutionalize people who have nowhere else to go.\"\nHomelessness is solved instead, Rabinowitz said, by providing folks with housing, support systems and healthcare.\n\"This executive order doesn\u2019t help anybody and it\u2019s shameful, it\u2019s government overreach and it will take homelessness worse,\" said Rabinowitz.\nFOX 5 did reach out to the mayor\u2019s office for a statement in response to Trump but they didn\u2019t provide one."

My ambition is to unpack this very complex region for our readers. To do that, I am committed to covering all aspects of life in Russia and beyond, including its rapid economic and cultural transformation and how it\u2019s impacting Russian society. I am especially interested in stories that can humanize our reader\u2019s understanding of what life is like in these countries.\nI have been covering Russia and the region as a journalist since 2013, when I started working for The Moscow Times and several independent Russian news outlets.

      "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 740 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act (Public Law 93-198), as amended (section 740 of the Home Rule Act), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Crime is out of control in the District of Columbia. Washington, District of Columbia, is our Nation\u2019s capital and home to the central institutions of American governance. Yet rising violence in the capital now urgently endangers public servants, citizens, and tourists, disrupts safe and secure transportation and the proper functioning of the Federal Government, and forces the diversion of critical public resources toward emergency response and security measures. The city government\u2019s failure to maintain public order and safety has had a dire impact on the Federal Government\u2019s ability to operate efficiently to address the Nation\u2019s broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence.\nThe increase in violent crime in the heart of our Republic has consequences beyond the individual tragedies that have dominated media coverage. Such lawlessness also poses intolerable risks to the vital Federal functions that take place in the District of Columbia. Violence and crime hamper the recruitment and retention of essential Federal employees, undermine critical functions of Government and thus the well-being of the entire Nation, and erode confidence in the strength of the United States. These conditions are disgraceful anywhere, but particularly in the capital of our Nation and the seat of the Federal Government. Citizens, tourists, and Federal workers deserve peace and security, not fear and violence. The smooth functioning of executive departments and agencies, courts, diplomatic missions, and the Federal Government demands an effective law-enforcement mechanism capable of halting the precipitous rise in violent crime, not one that permits Government workers to be violently attacked by mobs or fatally shot close to the Federal buildings where they work.\nThe magnitude of the violent crime crisis places the District of Columbia among the most violent jurisdictions in the United States. In 2024, the District of Columbia averaged one of the highest robbery and murder rates of large cities nationwide. Indeed, the District of Columbia now has a higher violent crime, murder, and robbery rate than all 50 States, recording a homicide rate in 2024 of 27.54 per 100,000 residents. It also experienced the Nation\u2019s highest vehicle theft rate with 842.4 thefts per 100,000 residents \u2014 over three times the national average of 250.2 thefts per 100,000 residents. The District of Columbia is, by some measures, among the top 20 percent of the most dangerous cities in the world.\nAs President, I have a solemn duty to take care that our laws are faithfully executed, and a sacred responsibility to protect the safety and security of United States citizens who live in and visit our Nation\u2019s capital, including Federal workers who live or commute into the District of Columbia. These conditions cannot persist. We will make the District of Columbia one of the safest cities in the world, not the most dangerous.\nSec. 2. Services of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia. I determine that special conditions of an emergency nature exist that require the use of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (Metropolitan Police force) for Federal purposes, including maintaining law and order in the Nation\u2019s seat of Government; protecting Federal buildings, national monuments, and other Federal property; and ensuring conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the Federal Government. Effective immediately, the Mayor of the District of Columbia (Mayor) shall provide the services of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act.\nSec. 3. Operational Control of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia. (a) The authority of the President conferred by section 740(a) of the Home Rule Act to direct the Mayor with respect to the current special conditions of an emergency nature is delegated to the Attorney General.\n(b) In accordance with section 740(a) of the Home Rule Act, the Mayor shall provide such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the Attorney General may deem necessary and appropriate.\nSec. 4. Monitoring and Recommendations. (a) The Attorney General shall monitor and regularly consult with any senior official the Attorney General deems appropriate on the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of Columbia that require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes.\n(b) The Attorney General shall regularly update me on the status of the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of Columbia that require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes.\n(c) The Attorney General shall inform me of any circumstances that, in the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President or that the action in this order is no longer necessary.\nSec. 5. Severability.

      "text": "Related Content\nPress Release\nPress Release\nWASHINGTON - Total violent crime for 2024 in the District of Columbia is down 35% from 2023 and is the lowest it has been in over 30 years, according to data collected by the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and announced by United States Attorney Matthew M. Graves. A breakdown of the data is available here.\nIn addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides are down 32%; robberies are down 39%; armed carjackings are down 53%; assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 27% when compared with 2023 levels, with the District reporting the fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.\n\u201cThe strategy this Office began to employ shortly after I came into this role has been to work with our law enforcement partners to focus on the drivers of violence - those gangs or crews of people who are dealing drugs, protecting turf, committing carjackings and other robberies, all while armed,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Graves. \u201cIt takes time to develop these investigations and prosecutions, but this is the fruit of that labor - a reduction in the violent crime - that D.C. is now seeing.\u201d\nA central component of this strategy has been targeting those crews who have preyed upon certain neighborhoods in our community, often operating drug trafficking networks in these neighborhoods. These proactive investigations and prosecutions have yielded immediate reductions in violence that have had lasting impact. For instance, an MPD analysis of crime trends in the area around MLK Mellon before and after a crew operating a drug market in that area was arrested revealed that there was a 66% reduction in violent crime in the area when comparing the six months prior to the arrests to the six months after the arrests. Even two years after these arrests, there was a 56% reduction in the number of homicides that occurred after the arrests when compared to the two years before.\nAnother key component of this proactive approach was implementing in April 2022, Project Safe Neighborhood - a daily review by the Office and our law enforcement partners of every firearms arrest in the District to determine, using objective criteria about the person arrested and the firearm recovered, whether the case should be charged in U.S. District Court or D.C. Superior Court. Since April 2022, the Office has accepted for prosecution in U.S. District Court more than 150 gun offenders under this initiative.\nFinally, the Office has continued to do all that it can to hold accountable those who commit violent crimes with firearms and those who illegally possess firearms. And the Office has committed to provide on a quarterly basis data related to these efforts - data that can be found here. This data reflects that in the first half of 2024, the Office was able to charge at the time of arrest more than 90% of arrests for violent crimes committed with guns and nearly 70% of gun possession arrests. The Office continues to investigate many of these arrests even if it does not charge on the day of arrest. Also in the first half of 2024, the Office obtained convictions in approximately 75% of these gun-related cases.\nThese numbers related to firearms offenses are critical and stand in stark contrast to the overall day-of-arrest charging rate for every arrest in the District of Columbia, which is a significantly less informative metric. The vast majority of arrests in the District of Columbia are for misdemeanor offenses that are often non-violent in nature. For such offenses, the Office has had a longstanding practice of giving great weight to victims\u2019 wishes about whether they want charges brought. For a variety of reasons, a substantial number of victims do not want criminal charges brought for these relatively minor offenses.\nIn Fiscal Year 2019, the Office expanded into a new section the number of prosecutors devoted to reviewing arrests and examining body-worn camera (BWC) footage - Fiscal Year 2018 was the first Fiscal Year where BWC had been fully deployed for the entire year - to determine whether the BWC footage reflected issues that would later require the Office to dismiss a prosecution or if there were otherwise fatal flaws with the case. This section is called the Early Case Assessment Section (ECAS). The combination of BWC footage and ECAS\u2019s early detection of arrests that, if charged, would later need to be dismissed led to relatively modest decreases in cases charged at the time of arrest in Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019.\nThe overall day-of-arrest charging rate dropped dramatically in Fiscal Years 2020, 2021, and 2022, as the global pandemic brought the criminal justice system to a halt and the D.C. Department of Forensic Sciences lost its accreditation in 2021.\nOur Office, along with our local partners, worked to overcome these challenges and the overall day-of-arrest charging rate in Fiscal Year 2024 of 57% is virtually identical to the 54% day-of-arrest charging rate that the Office reported in Fiscal Year 2019 after forming ECAS. More significantly, though, the Office dismissed far fewer of the cases it charged in Fiscal Year 2024 than it did in Fiscal Year 2018, so more arrests resulted in a prosecutorial outcome in Fiscal Year 2024 than in Fiscal Year 2018. For felonies, in particular, the percentage of cases with a prosecutorial outcome rose from 66% in Fiscal Year 2018 to 85% in Fiscal Year 2024.\nThere is value in addressing the issues, such as the lack of drug testing, that were preventing our Office from charging, at the time-of-arrest, non-violent misdemeanor offenses. While charging more non-violent offenses can benefit the community and offenders are often sentenced to periods of probation with services that hopefully aid in rehabilitation, these cases typically do not identify and remove violent offenders from the community. As is universally recognized, targeting the relatively limited number of individuals responsible for driving gun violence is the most impactful thing that prosecutors can do to contribute to the kinds of sharp declines in violent crime the District saw in 2024. To that end, multiple proactive investigations are already underway that should further reduce violent crime in 2025.\n##\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube\nOr at https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc"

      "text": "Story highlights\nTrump in 1989: \"Maybe hate is what we need if we're gonna get something done.\"\nTrump on Friday stood by his controversial role in the case in a statement to CNN.\nDonald Trump this week stood by his controversial role in pushing for the death penalty following New York City\u2019s infamous 1989 \u201cCentral Park Five\u201d case, telling CNN\u2019s Miguel Marquez, \u201cThey admitted they were guilty.\u201d\nIn an interview with Larry King in 1989 unearthed from CNN\u2019s archives, Trump laid out his position, telling King, \u201cmaybe hate is what we need if we\u2019re gonna get something done.\u201d Delivering a similar message to one he takes on the campaign trail today, Trump also advocated for more protections for police.\nThe case involved five teenage boys of color, who were wrongly accused and convicted of beating and raping a woman in Central Park. Trump purchased full-page ads that ran in several New York City newspapers that read,\u201dBring Back The Death Penalty. Bring Back Our Police!\u201d\nIn the interview with King, Trump defended the ads.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything inciteful, I am strongly in favor of the death penalty,\u201d Trump told King. \u201cI am also in favor bringing back police forces that can do something instead of turning their back because every quality lawyer that represents people that are trouble, the first thing they do is start shouting police brutality, etc.\u201d\n\u201cI have never done anything that\u2019s caused a more positive stir. I\u2019ve had 15,000 \u2014 15,000 \u2014 letters in the last week and a half,\u201d continued Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t know of more than two or three that were negative out of 15,000. The ad\u2019s basically very strong and vocal, they are saying bring back law and order. And I\u2019m not just referring to New York, I\u2019m referring to everything.\u201d\nThe men were later exonerated in 2002, when another man confessed to the crime and DNA backed up his confession. Trump wrote an op-ed in the New York Daily News in 2014, calling New York City\u2019s $41 million settlement with the five men \u201ca disgrace.\u2019\nSpeaking with King in 1989, Trump said he had the support of 90% of the public, adding that 40% of newspaper columnists agreed.\n\u201cI had some women the other day stick a microphone in my face from one of the major networks, \u2018but don\u2019t you have compassion for these young men? That raped and beat and mugged and everything else this wonderful women,\u2019\u201d said Trump. \u201cDo I have hatred for them?\u201d\n\u201cAnd I said, look this women was raped, mugged, and thrown off a building \u2013 thrown off a building on top of everything else,\u201d continued Trump. \u201cShe\u2019s got some major problems to put it mildly. I said, \u2018of course I hate these people and let\u2019s all hate these people because maybe hate is what we need if we\u2019re gonna get something done.\u2019\u201d\nTrump told King his newspaper ads were not \u201cpre-judging\u201d the five teens, but rather advocating for their execution if they were to be found guilty. Trump also explained his ad didn\u2019t apply to minors, but said minors convicted of crimes should be locked up for a long time in the prison system.\nTrump said police were afraid of being charged with police brutality and the criminal justice system provided too many rights to alleged criminals.\n\u201cThe problem we have is we don\u2019t have any protection for the policeman. The problem with our society is the victim has absolutely no rights and the criminal has unbelievable rights \u2013 unbelievable rights. And I say it has to stop, and that\u2019s why I took the ad and I have to tell you, that ad, I have never done anything that\u2019s been so positively received. People are tired, sick and tired of what\u2019s happening.\u201d"

      "text": "The rock band Kiss is about to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and fans of the group have been hoping for a full-scale in-costume reunion of the four players who started the band 40 years ago \u2013 Gene Simmons, bass; Paul Stanley, rhythm guitar; Ace Frehley, lead guitar; and Peter Criss, drums. Mr. Frehley and Mr. Criss left and returned several times, and last performed with Kiss a decade ago. But Kiss has continued with other players, including its current guitarist, Tommy Thayer, and drummer, Eric Singer.\nBut over the weekend, the musicians made it clear that no reunion \u2013 in fact, no Kiss performance at all \u2013 would take place at the induction on April 10 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. In an appearance on the Eddie Trunk Rocks show on the New York radio station Q104.3, on Friday evening, Mr. Frehley (whose remarks are quoted extensively on Blabbermouth.com) complained bitterly that Mr. Simmons and Mr. Stanley had \u201cshot down doing any type of reunion\u201d with him and Mr. Criss, with or without makeup, and were planning to perform at the induction with the current lineup only.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something the fans wanted, it\u2019s something the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame asked of all four of us,\u201d Mr. Frehley said. \u201cThey shot it down. It is what it is. I don\u2019t completely understand it, but those guys do a lot of things that don\u2019t make sense to me. It\u2019s unfortunate for the fans. We\u2019re being inducted because of the fans. And I feel like the fans are being let down. And I\u2019m upset about it; I\u2019ve gotta be honest with you.\u201d\nMr. Criss was upset, too. Over the weekend, he posted a message on his website that reads: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to have to say to you, the fans, that as of today, Ace and I have been denied a performance with Gene and Paul for our Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.\u201d Noting that tickets for the induction go on sale on Monday, he added: \u201cThis is disgraceful and I feel bad for the fans who were looking forward to the four of us being inducted together.\u201d\nNot so fast, Mr. Stanley and Mr. Simmons said, by way of a note on Kiss\u2019s website, posted in response to Mr. Frehley\u2019s and Mr. Criss\u2019s comments.\n\u201cOur intention was to celebrate the entire history of Kiss and give credit to all members including longtime present members Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer, and additionally Bruce Kulick and Eric Carr, all who have made this band what it is, regardless of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\u2019s point of view,\u201d the unsigned statement says.\n\u201cThis is understandably an emotional situation where there is no way to please everyone. To bring this to a quick end, we have decided not to play in any lineup and we will focus our attention on celebrating our induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\u201d"

Several of the figures Trump has tapped to be cabinet members in his administration, such as Matt Gaetz, were also in attendance. During the event, it was announced that North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum had been selected to be submitted to serve as interior secretary.\n\u201cWe are in the presence of a really mythical character. I love mythology,\u201d Stallone said in his speech, after opening with a lengthy comparison drawing connections between Jesus Christ, his boxing character Rocky Balboa and Trump himself. \u201cNobody in the world could\u2019ve pulled off what he pulled off.
