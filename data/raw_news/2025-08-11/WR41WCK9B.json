  "title": "A Ron Howard thriller is one of the underrated movies you need to watch in August 2025",
  "description": "If you're looking for underrated movies in August, try watching a Ron Howard thriller, a Spike Lee drama, and an emotional music documentary.",
  "content": "The August release calendar for movies is rather light this year. Summer movie season should last for four months (first weekend in May to Labor Day), but most studios punt on the final weeks of August.\n\nHowever, The Naked Gun, The Bad Guys 2, Weapons, and Freakier Friday have proven audiences still crave big projects in August. Because real cinephiles want even more selection, you\u2019ll find three underrated movies this month. Two Oscar-winning filmmakers \u2014 Spike Lee and Ron Howard \u2014 have new movies, while a sensational documentarian covers a tragic musician.\n\nWe also have guides to the best new movies to stream, the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, and the best movies on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nIn 1994, a 27-year-old Jeff Buckley released his first studio album, Grace. The album received universal acclaim, and his haunting cover of Leonard Cohen\u2019s Hallelujah is considered one of the greatest albums of all time. That would be the only album Buckley ever released, as his life came to a tragic ending in 1997. Amy Berg\u2019s It\u2019s Never Over, Jeff Buckley explores the life of Cohen, from his complicated upbringing to his emergence as one of music\u2019s finest artists.\n\nThe documentary features never-before-seen footage of Buckley and interviews with those who knew Buckley best, including his mother and girlfriends. It\u2019s a touching tribute to an artist taken from the world entirely too soon.\n\nIt\u2019s Never Over, Jeff Buckley opens in theaters on August 8.\n\nThe collaboration between Spike Lee and Denzel Washington on their fifth movie, Highest 2 Lowest, should be one of the biggest stories in Hollywood. However, there has been little mainstream promotion in the weeks leading up to the theatrical release. Speaking of theaters, Highest 2 Lowest will only be in theaters for three weeks before it heads to its streaming home at Apple TV+, so don\u2019t expect high box office returns.\n\nWashington plays David King, a music mogul who faces a grave dilemma involving a ransom. Ilfenesh Hadera, Jeffrey Wright, ASAP Rocky, and Ice Spice also star. Complaints aside, cherish the fact that Lee and Washington are working together on a reinterpretation of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s 1963 Japanese film, High and Low. Having an undermarketed Lee movie in our lives is better than having no film at all from the Oscar-winning filmmaker.\n\nHighest 2 Lowest opens in theaters on August 15. It will be available to stream on Apple TV+ starting September 5.\n\nFor the better part of a year, the biggest story surrounding Eden was its lack of domestic distribution. After premiering at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival, Eden went months without a U.S. distributor, which pushed back its impending release. Finally, Vertical acquired the U.S. rights and will put the movie into theaters later this month.\n\nYou would think a Ron Howard movie starring Jude Law, Ana de Armas, Vanessa Kirby, and Sydney Sweeney would be an enticing proposition for a studio. The movie follows a husband and wife duo (Law and Kirby) who move to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands to live a life of solitude. The peace is soon interrupted by another couple (Sweeney and Daniel Br\u00fchl) and a baroness (de Armas). It\u2019s a classic thriller trope where you\u2019d think the dangers of the island would threaten them, but it turns out that people are their own worst enemies.",

The duo realizes their inner circles have been compromised.

Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nJustice has found a funny new face in Liam Neeson\u2019s comedy film, The Naked Gun. Directed by the Lonely Island\u2019s Akiva Schaffer and produced by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, this reboot puts Neeson in the role of Frank Drebin Jr., a Police Squad lieutenant and the son of Leslie Nielsen\u2019s iconic character from the original Naked Gun movies.\nThe Naked Gun has some huge shoes to fill after the revolutionary first film from Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker. Even with two prestigious comedy names behind the film, this Naked Gun reboot could\u2019ve been a hit or miss. Fortunately, Schaffer and MacFarlane\u2019s film honors the franchise\u2019s significant legacy while confidently establishing its own identity through its hilarious humor and strong performances.\nA familiar but unique story\nJust as the film brought the Naked Gun franchise back from the dead, this meta-comedy reboot sees Frank Drebin Jr. try to solve a murder that threatens to put an end to Police Squad once and for all. Frank uncovers the world-ending plot orchestrated by tech mogul billionaire Richard Cane (Danny Huston), who frames him for a murder.\nTo catch up with the times, this reboot modernizes the Naked Gun narrative with references to self-driving electric cars, online pop-up ads, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Sex and the City. However, the movie still features several familiar quirks and characters of the Naked Gun franchise that should satisfy long-time fans. These include the hard-boiled detective doing comedic voice-overs, the attractive and ditzy femme fatale, and the evil, wealthy genius trying to turn innocent people into murderers.\nWhile the movie features several franchise tropes, The Naked Gun doesn\u2019t try to be a carbon copy of the original. In fact, this reboot instantly shows its self-awareness as Frank expresses his desire to be like his dad but different. The villain\u2019s goal for recreating the human race can even be interpreted as a metaphor for wanting to go back to the good old days with men like Frank and his father at the forefront.\nComedy\u2019s next big stars are here\nFrank Drebin Jr. truly is his father\u2019s son. Neeson has already shown potential as a comedic actor many times with his appearances in Family Guy, Ted 2, and A Million Ways to Die in the West. However, The Naked Gun proved that he was the only one worthy of inheriting the name of Frank Drebin from Leslie Nielsen.\nAs Drebin Jr., Neeson brings out plenty of laughs with his buffoonish antics, deadpan joke delivery, and impeccable comedic timing. Neeson\u2019s performance is on par with Nielsen\u2019s work. Neeson adds a unique layer to his character by satirizing his own angry action hero persona with ultraviolent fight scenes and a revenge-fueled monologue. It\u2019s a breath of fresh air for his acting career that may even pave the way for more comedic roles.\nAt the same time, Pamela Anderson invokes the spirit of her predecessor, Priscilla Presley, with her new character, Beth Davenport. Her chemistry with Neeson is electric, and her straight-faced delivery makes her an equally hilarious presence, especially with her ridiculous jazz performance.\nAn onslaught of creative comedy\nLike the original film, The Naked Gun is a machine gun firing barrels of laughs every second. Given how MacFarlane has paid brilliant homage to The Naked Gun franchise numerous times on Family Guy, it\u2019s no surprise that he was able to get its brand of humor right for the new film.\nAs a modern reboot, The Naked Gun adds some social commentary with its jokes about Police Squad\u2019s problematic actions \u2014 Frank not wanting to use body cams and him having shot at very few white criminals. However, the film never gets heavy-handed with pushing a progressive narrative. Its clear priority is to be as silly and hilarious as possible, and it succeeds.\n2025\u2019s The Naked Gun features all the wacky ridiculousness that one can expect from the franchise. One can see Schaffer drawing from his experiences with the Lonely Island with these cartoonish, over-the-top moments. Most notably, Schaffer\u2019s film shows Frank disguising himself as a little schoolgirl to take down a gang of bank robbers and him and Beth having a threesome with a Satanic snowman.\nAlso, in MacFarlane\u2019s own fashion, The Naked Gun takes everyday chats and foibles and turns them into comedy gold, from Frank declaring his love for the Black Eyed Peas to him mourning the loss of his Buffy episodes on TiVo. There are even some traces of Austin Powers in the film\u2019s comedic DNA, specifically with that supposedly sexual thermal vision scene. The movie even executes a hysterical parody of another classic spy movie, Mission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout, with its layered, fake hospital scene.\nIs The Naked Gun worth a watch?\nTo be frank, yes. This Naked Gun movie may not be as good as the original, but it is still pretty damn good. The movie revives Naked Gun\u2019s distinctive brand of humor with its blend of clever wordplay and slapstick gags, bringing plenty of wit and wackiness to the story. While there are several different comedic styles at play, The Naked Gun blends them together to create an outrageous comedy extravaganza.\nNot only does this movie revive the Naked Gun franchise, but it also reignites hope for parody films and shows as a whole. Spoofs like The Naked Gun prove the genre can still succeed today and deliver great laughs when done right. And with it joining the ranks of History of the World: Part II and the upcoming Spaceballs sequel, The Naked Gun seems part of a much-welcome parody genre revival.\nThe Naked Gun is now playing in theaters."

      "text": "Prime Video\u2019s audience loves their favorite accountant. Ben Affleck reprised his role as the brilliant Christian Wolff earlier this year in The Accountant 2. After the action thriller\u2019s theatrical run, The Accountant premiered on Prime Video in early June. The movie nearly reached 80 million worldwide viewers on Prime Video, making it Amazon MGM Studios\u2019 second most-watched film of all time.\nLike many streaming services, Prime Video has a top 10 for the most popular films on the service. One of the selections, Wicked, is an excellent movie to watch this month. Read this guide for recommendations on what to stream on Prime Video.\nWe also have guides to the best new movies to stream, the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, the best movies on Amazon Prime Video, the best movies on HBO Max, and the best movies on Disney+.\n-\nThe Fire InsidePG-13 2024\n-\nHomefrontR 2013\n-\nMission: Impossible - Dead ReckoningPG-13 2023\nThe Accountant 2 (2025)\nOne of the world\u2019s most brilliant minds, who moonlights as a vigilante, returns for a sequel in The Accountant 2. Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is an accountant for some of the world\u2019s most nefarious criminals. When the body of Raymond King (J.K. Simmons) is found with \u201cfind the accountant\u201d on his arm, U.S. Treasury Deputy Director Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) asks Christian to help find the killer.\nKing was trying to track down a Salvadoran family and went to an assassin for help. Christian can\u2019t do this job alone, so he recruits his mercenary brother Brax (Jon Bernthal) as backup. The ensuing investigation leads to an organization of killers who will do anything to keep their secrets buried. Unfortunately for this criminal ring, they are going up against two highly skilled soldiers in Christian and Brax.\nWicked (2024)\nThe Tony Award-winning stage musical finally received its long-awaited feature film adaptation. Directed by Jon M. Chu, Wicked follows the lives of Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), a green-skinned introvert, and Galinda (Ariana Grande), the bubbly social butterfly. These two opposites form an unlikely friendship at Shiz University in the Land of Oz.\nAfter a tumultuous meeting with the Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum), the two women go down different paths, as Elphaba becomes the Wicked Witch of the West and Galinda assumes the mantle of Glinda the Good. Wicked is the first of a two-part adaptation. Part two, Wicked: For Good, premieres later in 2025.\nMoneyball (2011)\nHow can you not be romantic about baseball? In a career-defining performance, Brad Pitt plays a general manager looking to shake things up in Moneyball. Oakland A\u2019s general manager Billy Beane (Pitt) faces an uncertain offseason. His three best players are set to depart in free agency, and the team\u2019s owner does not want to overspend for players. Forced to sign players on a tight budget, Billy transforms his entire philosophy as a baseball evaluator.\nWith the help of the Ivy League-educated Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), Bill starts searching for underutilized and undervalued players to build his roster for the 2002 season. This sabermetric approach revolutionized the game of baseball. Who knew a bunch of guys talking in a room about baseball could be so riveting?\nThe Fire Inside (2024)\nThe Fire Inside is based on the true story of Olympic gold medalist, Claressa \u201cT-Rex\u201d Shields (Ryan Destiny), the first American woman to do so in boxing\u2026 twice. That\u2019s not a spoiler for the movie, because Claressa\u2019s Olympic triumph isn\u2019t the ultimate destination, it\u2019s just a stop along the way. The film movingly conveys Claressa\u2019s connection with her coach, Jason Crutchfield (Bryan Tyree Henry), and there\u2019s an understated bond between them. As much as Claressa has to fight her battles in the ring, she\u2019s got a lot of struggles in her daily life as well. Winning Olympic gold hasn\u2019t given Claressa the access to endorsements or lucrative deals that could pull her up to another level. All she ultimately has is her faith in herself and the support of the people closest to her.\nHomefront (2013)\nJason Statham doesn\u2019t always get surrounded by a strong supporting cast in his action flicks, but he\u2019s got a good lineup of colleagues with him in Homefront. Statham plays Phil Broker, a former DEA agent who has retired to raise his daughter, Maddy Broker (Izabela Vidovic), in peace.\nThat peace doesn\u2019t last long as Phil runs afoul of Cassie Bodine (Kate Bosworth), the mother of one of Maddy\u2019s classmates. Cassie enlist her brother, Morgan \u201cGator\u201d Bodine (James Franco), to get Phil out of the way. And through Gator, Phil\u2019s location is leaked to some of the most dangerous men he put away in the DEA.\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (2023)\nEthan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and Grace (Hayley Atwell) have a meet-cute in Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning that\u2019s worthy of any rom-com. They might have even had a romantic spark if she wasn\u2019t trying to steal something he needs to save the world. Regardless, Ethan and Grace spend a lot of time joined at the wrist \u2014 sometimes literally \u2014 because Ethan\u2019s racing against time to stop an AI known as The Entity.\nThis time, even the U.S. government doesn\u2019t want Ethan and his team to succeed, because if America can control The Entity then it will control the future. All of the other countries have the same mentality, but The Entity is the one really in control. And its reach extends to the real world, where it forces Ethan to make life-and-death decisions. He knows The Entity needs to be destroyed, but it may already be too late for that.\nThe Peanut Butter Falcon (2019)\nShia LaBeouf has one of his most moving performances in The Peanut Butter Falcon, which casts him as a crab catcher named Tyler. After literally burning his bridges with his former colleagues, Tyler hides out in the wilderness for their retribution. That\u2019s where he meets Zak (Zack Gottsagen), a young man with Down syndrome who is also on the run after escaping a facility.\nZak and Tyler emotionally bond, and they decide to stick together to help the former achieve his dream of learning how to wrestle under the legendary Salt Water Redneck (Thomas Haden Church). Eleanor (Dakota Johnson), the woman in charge of Zak\u2019s medical care, pursues the duo because she truly cares about Zak\u2019s well-being. And when she sees how well Zak and Tyler are together, she has to question whether bringing Zak home is the right move.\nAnother Simple Favor (2025)\nAfter the events of A Simple Favor, Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick) would have to be crazy to have anything to do with Emily Nelson (Blake Lively) ever again. Crazy or desperate. Stephanie\u2019s blip of fame since sending Emily to prison is largely burned out in Another Simple Favor. When Emily is released from prison and invites Stephanie to her destination wedding in Italy, she reluctantly accepts.\nStephanie isn\u2019t the only one from Emily\u2019s old life invited to the wedding. Emily\u2019s ex-husband, Sean Townsend (Henry Golding), and her mother, Margaret McLanden (Elizabeth Perkins), also made the trip. Regardless, Stephanie is expecting a double cross from Emily. And she\u2019s right to be suspicious, but the dangerous twist won\u2019t necessarily come the way she expects.\nConclave (2024)\nThe pope is dead in Conclave, meaning his successor must be chosen. Cardinal Thomas Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes), the dean of the College of Cardinals, will oversee the election of the next pope. And it\u2019s more than just a choice between the four major candidates. Whoever is chosen will shape the future of the Catholic Church itself.\nThe election may take place behind closed doors in Vatican City, but the secrets that emerge could end the careers of some and potentially spark more scandal in the church. There\u2019s a surprising amount of intrigue in the selection process, and the film also boasts a stellar supporting cast that includes Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, and Isabella Rossellini.\nGladiator II (2024)\nIt only took 24 years for a sequel to Gladiator to reach theaters. Russell Crowe\u2019s character remains dead, but Lucius Verus Aurelius (Paul Mescal) carries on the tradition of losing his family and being sold into slavery in Gladiator II. Connie Nielsen reprises her role as Lucilla from the first film, and she was the one who sent Lucius away for his own safety.\nIn Lucius\u2019 absence, Rome is ruled by not one but two mad emperors: Geta (Joseph Quinn) and Caracalla (Fred Hechinger). As Lucius climbs the ranks of the gladiators, a former slave named Macrinus (Denzel Washington) wants to use him to get the emperors out of the way. But Lucius is his own man, like his father before him.\nG20 (2025)\nAction hero Presidents aren\u2019t a new thing, but Viola Davis\u2019 character in G20 might be the first female action hero president. As far as President Danielle Sutton (Davis) knew, this year\u2019s G20 summit in South Africa was supposed to be an ordinary meeting of leaders from across the globe.\nThe Boys\u2018 Antony Starr co-stars in the film as Rutledge, the leader of the terrorists who take the security team by surprise and capture the world leaders. President Sutton manages to get free. And if she wants to save her family and her fellow leaders, then she\u2019ll need to get her hands dirty and do it herself.\nVal (2021)\nEven years before Val Kilmer became a star in Hollywood, he kept home movies from his childhood to his teens and beyond. It was the story of Kilmer\u2019s life that no one had seen until directors Ting Poo and Leo Scott put it all together as Val.\nThis documentary is also a family affair for Kilmer, his ex-wife Joanne Whalley, and their children, Mercedes and Jack. Since Kilmer had lost his voice during his battle with throat cancer, Jack Kilmer stepped in to read the words written by his father as he looked back at everything he went through to become the man he wanted to be.\nHolland (2025)\nWhat\u2019s eating Nancy Vandergroot (Nicole Kidman) in Holland? She\u2019s got a great thing going in this small town with overtly Dutch roots. Nancy\u2019s got a fine husband, Fred Vandergroot (Matthew Macfadyen), and their son, Harry (Jude Hill), is unusually well-behaved.\nIt\u2019s so perfect that the slightest imperfection alerts Nancy that maybe things aren\u2019t so rosy after all. For an optometrist, Fred sure takes a lot of out-of-town trips. Nancy\u2019s pretty sure that means Fred\u2019s having an affair, and she turns to her new friend, Dave Delgado (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal), to help her prove it. What they find isn\u2019t what Nancy expected, which turns her world upside down.\nTransformers One (2024)\nTransformers One is the origin story of the franchise\u2019s leading hero and villain: Optimus Prime and Megatron. At this point in their history, Optimus is known as Orion Pax (Chris Hemsworth), while the future Megatron is D-16 (Brian Tyree Henry). Both are miners on Cybertron, and good friends as well.\nAfter befriending B-127 (Keegan-Michael Key) and their former boss, Elita-1 (Scarlett Johansson), Orion and D-16 discover that Cybertron\u2019s ruler, Sentinal Prime (Jon Hamm), has betrayed the planet to their enemies. Orion and D-16 are both outraged by this revelation, but they aren\u2019t on the same page about how to handle it. That leads to the beginning of a rift between them that will have dire consequences for the future.\nTwisters (2024)\nThe new Superman, David Corenswet, has a small role in Twisters, which may be significant years down the line. But he\u2019s not the prime attraction here, and neither are Daisy Edgar-Jones or Glen Powell, the two topline stars who have top billing. Instead, it\u2019s the tornadoes themselves that are the stars of Twisters, especially when the film veers into cartoonish levels of destruction.\nYears ago, storm chaser Kate Carter (Edgar-Jones) had a radical idea that tornadoes could be potentially weakened through her experimental method. When the experiment fails, Kate and Javi (Anthony Ramos) are the only survivors from their team. In the present, Javi lures Kate out of retirement to retry her experiment. While back in the field, Kate encounters a YouTube storm chaser, Tyler Owens (Powell), whom she initially dislikes. When the chips are down and the winds are blowing, Kate will be glad to have Tyler on her side.\nThe Accountant (2016)\nThe Accountant 2 is coming very soon, so it\u2019s worth revisiting the original film ahead of time. Ben Affleck plays the unnamed title character in The Accountant, and he\u2019s the best criminal accountant that the underworld can buy. The Accountant\u2019s autism helps his mind crunch numbers and detect fraud inside criminal organizations. In other words, he can sniff out a rat who\u2019s stealing money from his fellow crooks.\nHis latest client is Living Robotics, after an internal client, Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick), uncovers startling irregularities in the company\u2019s records. Co-owner Rita Blackburn (Jean Smart) hired the Accountant to sort things out, but what he discovers is a deadly conspiracy that won\u2019t only target him. Dana will also become a target because she knows too much about the fraud.\nSmile 2 (2024)\nSmile 2 is an unusual sequel in that the events of the first film aren\u2019t really necessary to understand what\u2019s happening in this one. Skye Riley (Naomi Scott) has no idea who Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) is or what happened to her in Smile, and the person who unintentionally connects them is a police officer named Joel (Kyle Gallner). Before long, Skye finds herself plagued by the same curse that afflicted Rose and Joel, and she doesn\u2019t know what to make of all of the creepy smiles she sees on everyone\u2019s faces.\nSkye isn\u2019t just some random woman; she\u2019s a pop star on the verge of even greater stardom. But the curse has a way of getting under its victims\u2019 skin and driving them insane. Skye is no exception, and as the curse stalks her wherever she goes, she rapidly loses the ability to tell what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t.\nPicture This (2025)\nBridgerton\u2018s Simone Ashley leads the cast of Picture This as Pia, a young woman struggling to keep her photography business afloat as her family prepares for the month-long build-up to the wedding of her younger sister, Sonal (Anoushka Chadha).\nDuring one of the wedding events, a spiritual advisor tells Pia that she will find the love and career success that she has always wanted somewhere in the next five dates that she goes on. Pia doesn\u2019t necessarily believe in that prediction, but the thought of it hangs over her head with every romantic encounter that she has. She also has to deal with her ex-boyfriend, Charlie (Hero Fiennes Tiffin), who is part of the wedding party on the groom\u2019s side. Seeing Charlie again makes Pia reexamine their relationship, and it\u2019s hard not to wonder if the prediction about her love life was wrong.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie was such a massive hit both in theaters and on streaming that it\u2019s kind of redeemed everything that happened after the first Super Mario Bros. movie. Animation was clearly the way to go for this adaptation, as Mario (Chris Pratt), Luigi (Charlie Day), and Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) look like they stepped out of a Nintendo Switch and into a breathtaking video game world.\nThe story serves as an origin for the Mario brothers, as they accidentally find themselves transported to the Mushroom Kingdom just as it\u2019s under attack by Bowser (Jack Black) and his army of Koopa Troopas. When Luigi gets captured by Bowser, Mario has to discover his inner hero alongside Peach and Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) as they search for allies in their struggle.\nBlink Twice (2024)\nAlthough she doesn\u2019t have an on-screen role in Blink Twice, Zoe Kravitz made her directorial debut with this movie. Naomi Ackie headlines the cast as Frida, a young woman who scores an exclusive invitation from billionaire Slater King (Channing Tatum) to visit his private island alongside her best friend, Jess (Alia Shawkat).\nFrida and Jess are lavished with gifts and attention alongside the other female guests on the island. However, Frida notices that she\u2019s experiencing gaps in her memories. When Jess goes missing, Frida is the only one left who remembers her friend. There\u2019s something sinister going on, and this may not be Frida\u2019s first time on Slater\u2019s private island.\nIn the Land of Saints and Sinners (2023)\nLiam Neeson\u2019s action thrillers are kind of a dime a dozen, but In the Land of Saints and Sinners is one of his best. Neeson plays Finbar Murphy, a World War II veteran living in Ireland during \u201cthe Troubles\u201d in the \u201970s. To support himself, Finbar has started working for a crime boss, Robert McQue (Colm Meaney), as an assassin.\nFinbar also befriends a younger contract killer named Kevin (Game of Thrones\u2018 Jack Gleeson), but one of their mutual targets is the brother of Doireann McCann (Kerry Condon), a formidable woman who won\u2019t back down from her revenge. Doireann is determined to avenge her brother, no matter who she has to kill to do it.\nThe Fall Guy (2024)\nStunt man Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling) is burned out on Hollywood in The Fall Guy. It\u2019s hard to blame him after witnessing the injuries he suffers early in this movie. Unfortunately, Colt ruined his relationship with Jody Moreno (Emily Blunt) while he was torching his bridges to the entertainment industry. Nearly two years later, Colt reenters Jody\u2019s life when she\u2019s gotten the chance to direct her own movie.\nJody isn\u2019t exactly happy to see her ex again, but she needs her help. Her star, Tom Ryder (Kraven the Hunter\u2018s Aaron Taylor-Johnson), has gone missing, and this is more than just an actor on an extended bender. Without Tom, there is no movie to be made, and Jody\u2019s career will be over before it starts. Thus, Colt is drawn into a bigger mystery as he tries to locate Tom and make amends with Jody.\nA Quiet Place: Day One (2024)\nTypically, alien invasion movies involve humanity putting up a fight. But in A Quiet Place: Day One, the battle is over before it even begins, as humans can\u2019t withstand an attack by sightless alien hunters. Sam (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) witnessed the carnage herself while on a day out with her cat in the city.\nSam quickly realizes that her survival hinges on her ability to be quiet. Another survivor, Eric (The Fantastic Four: First Steps\u2018 Joseph Quinn), might be the last friend she ever makes. Sam and Eric must stick together if they want to escape New York City and evade the hunters now roaming the Earth.\nThe Bikeriders (2024)\nThe Bikeriders is loosely based upon the experiences of author Danny Lyon, a character portrayed by Mike Faist in this adaptation. But the film is largely reworked into an original story that focuses on three characters: Kathy (Jodie Comer), her lover, Benny (Austin Butler), and the leader of the Vandals Motorcycle Club, Johnny (Tom Hardy).\nJohnny had high-minded ideals when he founded the club in the 1960s. Over the course of the next decade, Johnny and his friends are almost unrecognizable in what they\u2019re willing to do for the club. Despite Benny\u2019s love for Kathy, he keeps getting drawn back into Johnny\u2019s vision for the club, even when it may destroy him.\nKnives Out (2019)\nDaniel Craig sheds his James Bond persona like a separate skin in Knives Out. Craig steps into the role of Southern sleuth Benoit Blanc, a man whose accent is just shy of Foghorn Leghorn territory. However, the voice somehow works for this comedic murder mystery. Ana de Armas has a standout turn as Marta Cabrera, the loyal housekeeper of a wealthy author, Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer).\nAfter Harlan dies, his spoiled extended family is stunned to discover that his entire fortune has been left to Marta. The family does not know that Harlan was murdered. Plus, Marta is horrified to discover that the evidence points back to her just as Blanc begins his investigation.\nAbigail (2024)\nScream\u2018s Melissa Barrera reunites with directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett for Abigail, a film that is very much unlike her previous genre movies. Barrera plays Joey, a military veteran who has hit hard times. That\u2019s why she agreed to work with Frank (Dan Stevens) and a group of other criminals to kidnap a young girl named Abigail (Alisha Weir).\nJoey tries to form a connection with Abigail to assure the young girl that she will remain safe before learning that the latter is the daughter of a dangerous crime lord, Kristof Lazaar (Matthew Goode). However, the greatest threat to the kidnappers is Abigail herself, because she\u2019s more than she appears to be. When Abigail strikes, it\u2019s lethal.\nCanary Black (2024)\nYou can tell that Canary Black has been on the shelf for a while since it has the late Ray Stevenson in one of his final roles. But it\u2019s also a showcase for Kate Beckinsale to get back into her action heroine mode, which she\u2019s been doing for about two decades now. Beckinsale plays Avery Graves, a CIA operative who has kept her husband, David Brooks (Rupert Friend), in the dark about who she really is and what her job entails.\nWhen terrorists kidnap David, they blackmail Avery into retrieving a file called Canary Black that could lead to an attack on her country. Stevenson plays Avery\u2019s mentor and boss, Jarvis Hedlund, and even he\u2019s not sure he can trust her when she goes rogue. But if Avery can\u2019t find a way out from under the terrorists\u2019 control, she may lose everything she holds dear.\nMonkey Man (2024)\nDev Patel made his directorial debut with Monkey Man, a film in which he also stars as the main character. And despite the title, Patel\u2019s character doesn\u2019t actually transform into a monkey or even go by that name. The audience only knows him as Kid, a man who will do anything to get his revenge on Rana Singh (Sikandar Kher), the corrupt police chief who murdered his mother.\nKid does wear a monkey mask when he\u2019s in the ring for an underground fighting circuit. However, his real disguise is pretending to be an ordinary waiter at a high-end brothel so he can rise through the ranks and get close enough to assassinate Rana no matter what his vengeance costs him.\nTerrifier 2 (2022)\nArt the Clown (David Howard Thornton) is back for another round of terror in Terrifier 2. Some evil entity has resurrected Art yet again, and he goes on another rampage. A teenager named Sienna Shaw (Lauren LaVera) is haunted by dreams of Art and she\u2019s convinced that her late father knew how to stop the clown once and for all.\nArt must sense the same thing, since he kidnaps Sienna\u2019s brother, Jonathan (Elliott Fullam), and terrorizes their family. Now, Sienna has to save her brother, but first, she must live through her encounter with Art.\nChallengers (2024)\nYou may have to pay close attention to Challengers, because the story doesn\u2019t take place in chronological order. Zendaya stars as Tashi Duncan, a rising tennis star romantically drawn to two other players on the pro tour: Patrick Zweig (Josh O\u2019Connor) and Art Donaldson (Mike Faist).\nBoth young men want Tashi for themselves, but only one of them is willing to play dirty to get her. Even when one of them wins Tashi\u2019s heart, it doesn\u2019t end the romantic entanglement between this trio as their lives unfold and intersect over several years. Ultimately, the battle between these two men is going to come back to the place where it all began: on the tennis court.\nPuss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022)\nIn the long wait between Shrek movies, Antonio Banderas\u2019 Puss in Boots has been keeping the franchise alive. But in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, time is almost up for the title character. Puss relies on his nine lives to survive the epic adventures. And now that Puss is on his very last life, he\u2019s truly scared about his potential fate \u2014 so much so that he abandons his identity and tries to live as a normal cat.\nHowever, Puss learns that there may be a way to restore his lost lives if he can find a magical wishing star. Puss isn\u2019t the only one looking for the star, nor the only one who desperately needs what it can offer him. This quest reunites Puss with his ex-fianc\u00e9e, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault), and forces him to reevaluate what he really wants.\nSnack Shack (2024)\nSnack Shack is a coming-of-age comedy set in 1991. A.J. Carter (Conor Sherry) and his friend, Moose Miller (Gabriel LaBelle), are 14-year-olds whose schemes to get money almost always backfire on them. At least until they hit upon the idea of running the local Snack Shack for the summer.\nTheir bond of friendship is tested when A.J. meets Brooke, his attractive new neighbor. Because Moose makes the first move on Brooke, this creates tension between him and A.J., who isn\u2019t willing to simply back off. As Brooke begins to reciprocate A.J.\u2019s feelings, his friendship and lucrative partnership with Moose may come crashing down.\nBob Marley: One Love (2024)\nBob Marley: One Love is a music biopic that takes place late in the life of reggae superstar Bob Marley (Kingsley Ben-Adir). After Bob and his wife, Rita Marley (The Marvels actress Lashana Lynch), narrowly survive an assassination attempt in his native Jamaica, it sends him into a creative tailspin that threatens to derail his dreams.\nBefore Bob can resume his message of peace, he has to face his own inner demons and work out his issues with Rita. Bob Marley didn\u2019t have a lot of time in this world, but the film shows that he made the most of what he had and left a lasting legacy of music behind.\nAmerican Fiction (2023)\nAmerican Fiction casts The Batman Part Two\u2019s Jeffrey Wright as Dr. Thelonious \u201cMonk\u201d Ellison, a college professor and a novelist whose books sell very poorly. Monk is also upset that another writer, Sinatra Golden (Issa Rae), has found massive success while seemingly pandering to Black stereotypes. So Monk writes his own novel as a satire of Golden\u2019s books before submitting it for publication.\nMuch to Monk\u2019s surprise and horror, his satire is embraced by the publisher and the general public. The satire of the piece goes unnoticed, as the book becomes so popular that it starts taking over Monk\u2019s life, even though he made sure that his real name wasn\u2019t listed as the author. But once the book is out and Hollywood comes knocking, it may be too late.\nThe Idea of You (2024)\nThe irony of the premise of The Idea of You is that the romantic entanglement of Sol\u00e8ne Marchand (Eileen\u2018s Anne Hathaway) with boy band lead singer Hayes Campbell (Nicholas Galitzine) would probably be more of a fantasy for Sol\u00e8ne\u2019s daughter, Izzy (Ella Rubin), than for Sol\u00e8ne herself. But one unplanned encounter between Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes soon leads to several others.\nThere is an age gap between Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes that does come up in the film, but the bigger issue between them is the celebrity gap. As long as Hayes is a world-famous musician, he and Sol\u00e8ne may never be able to enjoy a normal romance without being hounded by the press.\nRoad House (2024)\nIn this remake of the popular 1989 movie starring Patrick Swayze, Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Elwood Dalton as a former UFC fighter who has fallen on some hard times. Road House gives Elwood a chance for redemption when Frankie (Jessica Williams) recruits him to be the bouncer at her bar, which shares its name with the title of the film.\nElwood\u2019s fighting skills go a long way towards keeping order at The Road House, much to the anger of a local mobster, Ben Brandt (Billy Magnussen). Elwood took care of Brandt\u2019s regular goons with ease, but he\u2019ll have a much harder time handling Knox, an enforcer for Brandt who is played by an actual UFC fighter, Conor McGregor.\nThe Other Zoey (2023)\nThe Other Zoey is not a remake of the Sandra Bullock rom-com While You Were Sleeping. But romantic comedy fans may notice some similarities between the two. Josephine Langford stars as Zoey Miller, a high school student who is definitely not the girlfriend of soccer star Zach MacLaren (Drew Starkey), whose girlfriend is also named Zoey (Maggie Thurmon).\nWhen Zach suffers a head injury that gives him partial amnesia, he mistakes Zoey for his girlfriend, and his doctors warn her not to upset him with the truth. So Zoey carries on the deception and gets closer to Zach on a lavish vacation. At the same time, Zoey also feels attracted to Zach\u2019s cousin, Miles Maclaren (Archie Renaux), who shares many of her views about love and life. So, which guy does Zoey really want? You\u2019ll have to watch the film to find out.\nRole Play (2023)\nEmma (The Flight Attendant\u2018s Kaley Cuoco) and Dave Brackett (David Oyelowo) are just about as happy as a couple could be in Prime Video\u2019s Role Play. The Bracketts have two children and a beautiful home in a New Jersey suburb. What they\u2019re lacking is the passion in the bedroom that they used to have before starting a family.\nFor their anniversary, Dave and Emma take a trip to New York and indulge in some role play. That turns out to be a mistake when Bob Kellerman (Bill Nighy) blows Emma\u2019s cover and exposes her as an international assassin. Now, Emma has to use her skills to protect her family and keep her marriage to Dave intact.\nTotally Killer (2023)\nAmazon Studios\u2019 Totally Killer seems to welcome comparisons to Back to the Future, and it\u2019s one of the more unique blends of sci-fi, comedy, and horror. The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\u2019s Kiernan Shipka stars as Jamie, a teenager who is very familiar with the story about how her mom, Pam (Julie Bowen), survived the Sweet Sixteen Killer 35 years ago. It\u2019s something that Jamie has heard about many times in her life.\nWhen the Sweet Sixteen Killer returns in the present, Jamie finds herself transported back in time to 1987, when her much younger mother (Olivia Holt) was apparently one of the mean girls in school. Yet if Jamie can\u2019t protect Pam in the past then she may not have a future to go home to."

      "text": "Having started as a young actor on productions like The Andy Griffith Show, Happy Days, and American Graffiti, Ron Howard jumped to the director\u2019s chair and helmed some of the most beloved narrative films and documentaries in modern history. He may not have delivered many hit films in his later years, but Howard continues to direct, with his next A-list thriller, Eden, expected to release later this year. For now, here are the rankings for Howard\u2019s best movies.\n10. The Beatles: Eight Days a Week (2016)\nOne of the multiple documentaries directed by Howard, Eight Days A Week traces the rise and evolution of The Beatles as they toured the globe, analyzing how the band changed the world and touched the lives of so many people, and vice versa.\nHoward succeeds in bringing the Beatles to life with archival photos and videos, conveying the humble origins and childlike bond between the four friends. It also succeeds in re-invoking the musical chaos unleashed by fans as they screamed their heads off at the height of Beatlemania.\n9. Splash (1984)\nThis rom-com follows a lonely man (Tom Hanks) who falls in love with a mermaid (Daryl Hannah) who is hunted by a bumbling scientist (Eugene Levy). Please keep in mind that this film came out long before The Little Mermaid.\nSplash may not have broken any new ground. Yet Howard presents a hysterical and heartfelt love story elevated by the chemistry between Hanks and Hannah and the cast\u2019s performances.\n8. Jim Henson Idea Man (2024)\nThis heartfelt Disney+ documentary analyzes the extraordinary life of Jim Henson, the beloved creator of The Muppets, Fraggle Rock, Labyrinth, and The Dark Crystal, as well as the relationship he had with his wife Jane and his partner in puppetry, Frank Oz.\nThe film\u2019s vibrant visuals and editing reflect Henson\u2019s wild imagination and energetic personality. But as the film explores Henson\u2019s creative mind and his passion for entertainment, audiences are reminded of what made him so special and the impact he and his creations had on the world.\n7. Parenthood (1989)\nReminiscent of Modern Family and Arrested Development, this family comedy follows four adult siblings struggling to raise their kids. Featuring stars like Steve Martin, Tom Hulce, Rick Moranis, and Dianne Wiest, Parenthood displays many wacky but relatable visions of parenthood in the modern age, exploring the ups and downs of having a family in a hilarious and tender manner.\nThis film even spawned a six-season series on NBC years later, proving the timelessness of a topic like parenthood.\n6. Backdraft (1991)\nIn this version of Top Gun with firefighters, Backdraft follows two brothers (Kurt Russell and William Baldwin) as they try to stop a string of flames started by a serial arsonist. The story may not be all it\u2019s cracked up to be, but it is still a humorous and heartful classic with its tale of brotherly love persevering as they try to contain these destructive flames.\nThe film also boasts a slew of incredible cast performances and stunning visual effects used to bring its blazing action to life. Unsurprisingly, Backdraft was nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Sound, Best Sound Effects Editing, and Best Visual Effects, making it amongst Howard\u2019s most recognized pictures.\n5. Frost/Nixon (2008)\nNominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, Frost/Nixon chronicles the making of the television interviews between journalist David Frost (Michael Sheen) and Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) after the infamous Watergate scandal and Nixon\u2019s resignation as U.S. President. Despite the creative liberties taken, Frost/Nixon presents an incredible verbal jousting match as Frost tries to extract the truth from the former president.\nNot only does Frost/Nixon analyze one of the biggest scandals in American history, but it presents an intriguing study of two men and the lengths they go to for what they think is right.\n4. The Paper (1994)\nThis film follows the day in the lives of a tabloid newspaper as its members investigate the mysterious murder of two businessmen pinned on two Black teenagers. Helmed by an incredible performance by Michael Keaton, this satirical, fast-paced film captures the spiraling chaos frequently found in the media.\nThough the film was released thirty years ago, and the newspaper industry has all but faded, The Paper remains relevant with its grounded character drama and depiction of heightened racial tensions.\n3. Cinderella Man (2005)\nCinderella Man depicts the true story of boxing champ James Braddock (Russell Crowe), who literally fights for his life as he struggles to financially support his family in the wake of the Great Depression. As its title implies, this film presents a riveting Cinderella story embodying the American dream.\nBraddock starts from the bottom and rises to become champion in and out of the ring. And with heavy-hitting performances from Crowe, Renee Zellweger, and Paul Giamatti, the film ranks among classic boxing movies like Rocky and Raging Bull.\n2. A Beautiful Mind (2001)\nThis dazzling and layered film adapts the true story of John Nash (Russell Crowe), the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician who becomes a cryptographer for the U.S. government, only to begin questioning his reality as he confronts a grand conspiracy and his declining mental health. While it may have dropped the ball in depicting Nash\u2019s schizophrenia, A Beautiful Mind still presents a compelling and heart-wrenching portrayal of a brilliant man struggling to connect with the people around him.\nIt is also worth recognizing Jennifer Connelly\u2019s spellbinding performance as Nash\u2019s supportive but struggling wife, Alisha. And having won Howard the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director, A Beautiful Mind remains one of his most successful films.\n1. Apollo 13 (1995)\n\u201cHouston, we have a problem.\u201d This biopic presents the lives of the astronauts who embarked on the titular journey and their struggle to return to Earth alive. The way the movie simulates the weightlessness of space alone makes it a realistic and innovative picture.\nBut Apollo 13 and the gripping performances of its cast bring viewers to the edge of their seats through this immersive and heart-pounding depiction of one of the biggest crises in the history of space travel. And with nine Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Apollo 13 arguably remains Howard\u2019s greatest contribution to cinema."

      "text": "This month on Netflix, we\u2019re spotlighting the action comedy. What\u2019s better than mixing in a few laughs with some fight scenes and explosions? Our first movie features an actor \u2014 the funniest man alive \u2014 reprising a legendary role in Beverly Hills.\nOur second pick is a buddy cop movie from the \u201990s featuring an indelible duo. Finally, we\u2019re taking you back to 1980 to experience some blues music. All three action movies are now streaming on Netflix.\nWe also have guides to the best new movies to stream, the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, and the best movies on Amazon Prime Video.\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F (2024)\nMore often than not, legacy sequels fail to recapture the magic of their predecessor. Look no further than Space Jam: A New Legacy, Zoolander 2, The Exorcist: Believer, and Jaws: The Revenge as examples. Luckily for the Beverly Hills Cop franchise, it has Eddie Murphy, who reprised his iconic role as Axel Foley in the surprisingly effective fourth outing, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F.\nWhen Axel Foley (Murphy) heads back to Los Angeles, it\u2019s personal. He\u2019s looking to reconnect with his daughter, Jane Saunders (Taylour Paige), a defense attorney. When a criminal organization zeroes in on Jane, Axel teams with her ex-boyfriend (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and his two old friends, Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Ashton), to protect his daughter. You can\u2019t fake charisma, and when Murphy slips back into Axel\u2019s fast-talking ways, the movie soars.\nStream Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F on Netflix.\nRush Hour (1998)\nI\u2019m unaware of the national consensus on Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker as a buddy cop duo. For me, they\u2019re top draft picks. The martial arts star and the comedic lightning rod joined forces in 1998\u2019s Rush Hour. After the kidnapping of a Chinese diplomat\u2019s daughter, Hong Kong Detective Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) travels to America to work the case. However, the FBI does not want Lee to be involved, so they assign him to be the LAPD\u2019s problem.\nEnter Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker), the obnoxious and smooth-talking cop tasked with babysitting Lee. Lee and Carter initially hate each other. However, the duo realizes that their best chance of saving the little girl is to work together. From Chan\u2019s extravagant fight choreography to Carter\u2019s crisp one-liners, Rush Hour is a classic \u201990s comedy that remains a gold standard for chemistry between co-stars.\nStream Rush Hour on Netflix.\nThe Blues Brothers (1980)\nWith elaborate car chases and thunderous explosions, The Blues Brothers is most definitely an action comedy. John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd star as Jake and Elwood, the Blues Brothers, based on their excellent sketch from Saturday Night Live. After being released from jail, Jake reunites with Elwood and checks in on the Catholic orphanage that raised them. Unfortunately, the orphanage will close unless they pay $5,000 in property taxes.\nAfter an epiphany, Jake and Elwood decide to reform their band, the Blues Brothers, and organize a concert to raise money. Along the way, the Blues Brothers are chased by Neo-Nazis, rival bands, police, and a sadistic woman. The music is great, the chases are exciting, and the laughs are nonstop. What more could you want?\nStream Blues Brothers on Netflix."

      "text": "Thanks to Disney\u2019s acquisition of Fox, Hulu is the home for movies under the latter\u2019s umbrella, including Fox Searchlight Pictures and 20th Century Studios. Speaking of 20th Century Studios, one of the company\u2019s 2025 releases, The Amateur, is now on Hulu. The revenge thriller channels the spirit of the \u201990s action movies that we came to love.\nA pair of underrated movies from the 2000s \u2014 Sunshine and (500) Days of Summer \u2014 should be next up on your watchlist. Explore the list of the best movies on Hulu right now below.\nWe also have guides to the best new movies to stream, the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, the best movies on Amazon Prime Video, the best movies on HBO Max, and the best movies on Disney+.\nThe Amateur (2025)\nRami Malek is a CIA analyst out for revenge in The Amateur. Charlie Heller (Malek) is a cryptographer who prefers to work behind a desk. Charlie\u2019s world comes crashing down after his wife (Rachel Brosnahan) is killed in a terrorist attack. Conducting his own investigation, Charlie identifies the four suspects who played a part in his wife\u2019s death. When Charlie brings this information to his superiors, they refuse to take action.\nMotivated by revenge, the introverted Charlie heads into the field and hunts down his wife\u2019s killers. The CIA eventually realizes that it made a mistake to underestimate Charlie, who becomes a ruthless vigilante that the agency cannot control.\nSunshine (2007)\nBefore directing the Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire, Danny Boyle helmed the vastly underrated sci-fi thriller, Sunshine. In the future, Earth begins freezing due to the Sun\u2019s deterioration. The human race will cease to exist if the Sun dies. Eight astronauts \u2014 including Robert Capa (Cillian Murphy), James Mace (Chris Evans), and Cassie (Rose Byrne) \u2014 aboard the Icarus II are tasked with detonating a stellar bomb inside the Sun in hopes of reigniting it.\nLike all explorations to outer space, everything that can go wrong will go wrong. Each problem results in another tragedy. These astronauts thought they could make it home. As they approach the Sun, they quickly realize that completing the mission is all that matters.\n(500) Days of Summer (2009)\nExplore the highs and lows of a relationship in (500) Days of Summer. Greeting-card writer Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) instantly falls hard for the company\u2019s new employee, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel). Tom and Summer seems like a perfect match due to their compatible personalities and similar interests. Summer wants to keep things casual, while Tom wants a serious commitment. Despite their views on love, they embark on a passionate relationship.\nBecause the film is presented in a nonlinear narrative, you immediately find out that Summer breaks up with Tom. As the film jumps back and forth between timelines, you learn what went wrong for Tom and what he must do to move on. (500) Days of Summer is a unique take on the rom-com genre, backed by charming performances and a hopeful message."

      "text": "\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nWriter-director Zach Cregger (Barbarian) has delivered another frightening masterpiece with his new blockbuster, Weapons. This ensemble horror epic follows the residents of Maybrook after 17 children from the same classroom all walk out of their homes and disappear at 2:17 a.m., unleashing a wave of terror and confusion on everyone.\nCregger made a spectacular step forward as a horror filmmaker with Weapons, proving that his success with Barbarian wasn\u2019t a fluke. Like directors Jordan Peele and John Krasinski, Cregger succeeds in branching out from his comedy roots and establishing himself as one of the brightest, most distinctive horror directors working today with his winding, layered story of an ordinary town that descends into Hell.\nUnique, unbridled, unpredictable\nWeapons presents a nonlinear narrative from multiple characters\u2019 perspectives. Specifically, it follows Justine (Julia Garner), father Archer Graff (Josh Brolin), police officer Paul Morgan (Alden Ehrenreich), principal Andrew Marcus (Benedict Wong), homeless drug addict Anthony (Austin Abrams), and Justine\u2019s remaining student Alex Lilly (Cary Christopher).\nThis story sends the audience on a terrifying odyssey through Maybrook and unravels the film\u2019s layered mystery from several points of view. Though this narrative could\u2019ve been hard to follow, the movie neatly organizes all its different storylines and has them converge in many surprising ways.\nHarkening back to Stephen King\u2019s It, the setting of Maybrook itself becomes a character as it reveals the personal demons haunting its various townspeople through an explicit supernatural lens. After the kids from Justine\u2019s class disappear, the parents of the missing kids direct all their fear, sorrow, and hatred toward Justine as they blame her for this baffling tragedy and demand answers.\nHowever, Weapons presents a rich mosaic of human misery with its expansive narrative, which showcases its characters living through grief, drug addiction, alcoholism, police brutality, school bullying, and familial abuse. Like many great horror movies, Weapons shows that the true monsters aren\u2019t witches and zombies but the ones living deep inside ourselves and our neighbors.\nA rich cast of conflicted characters\nAs a dark, harrowing portrait of small-town America, Weapons and its cast bring many flawed and realistic characters to life. Julia Garner gives a layered performance as the well-meaning but misunderstood Justine. While the character\u2019s relationship with Paul could\u2019ve been fleshed out more, Garner\u2019s dysfunctional romantic chemistry with co-star Alden Ehrenreich makes these two lovers seem especially real.\nMeanwhile, Josh Brolin generates rage and sympathy as the grieving and confused Archer, particularly with his tear-jerking nightmare about his son. Though Archer\u2019s character clashes with Justine, the line-crossing actions they take to get to the truth make them strong reflections of each other.\nAustin Abrams delivers swift comic relief playing the twitchy, crack-addicted James, whose short-lived subplot makes for a wild ride. Meanwhile, the young Cary Christopher stands out with his performance as Alex, realistically conveying the terror, torment, and confusion felt by a child being held hostage by his own family.\nWhile her character didn\u2019t get her own segment, Amy Madigan steals the show as Aunt Gladys. Without giving away too much, Madigan cements her character as an instant horror icon\nWeapons unloads great terror and suspense\nLike with Barbarian, Cregger proves he is a master of invoking extreme terror and building tension with Weapons. The horror is well-rounded with a terrifying blend of nail-biting suspense and genuinely surprising jump scares. The scare factor is only elevated by Scarlett Sher\u2019s unsettling narration, Larkin Seiple\u2019s eerie cinematography, and a chilling musical score created through Cregger\u2019s collaboration with Ryan and Hays Holladay.\nThough Weapons is a slow burn, its moments of horror are intense and unforgettable. With a bug-eyed Benedict Wong chasing after Justine and Aunt Gladys popping up in people\u2019s dreams, the film turns a seemingly ordinary Maybrook into a town filled with terrors. It all crescendos with the film\u2019s suspenseful, frightening final act, which features one of the wildest, most cathartic kills ever seen in a horror movie.\nThe film blends its ultra-horrifying moments with bits of dark humor that will leave audiences screaming and laughing. With Archer repeatedly punching a brainwashed man to Gladys fleeing from a mob across the neighborhood like Ferris Bueller, Weapons shows Cregger flexing his comedic chops to send audiences on an emotional roller coaster.\nIs Weapons worth a watch?\nWeapons is hands-down one of the most bizarre and terrifying horror movies of the decade. It\u2019s a must-see for fans of the genre. Cregger continues to share a fresh voice as a filmmaker thanks to his movie\u2019s unconventional narrative with realistic characters and incredible terror. If Cregger continues to make terrifying blockbusters after Weapons, then the world of cinema is better off for it.\nWeapons is now playing in theaters."

When the mayor refuses to close the beaches, it leads to several deaths and causes widespread panic.\nPolice Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) finally receives approval to hunt the shark. Along with oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and boat captain Quint (Robert Shaw), Brody heads out to sea to kill the shark. The three men quickly learn that in the battle of man versus beast, the beast takes no prisoners.\nMad Max: Fury Road (2015)\n30 years after Beyond Thunderdome, George Miller helmed his magnum opus, Mad Max: Fury Road. While traveling across the Wasteland, Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) is captured by Immortan Joe\u2019s War Boys and brought to his fortress, the Citadel. Meanwhile, Joe\u2019s top lieutenant, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), escapes in an armored truck, the War Rig, with Joe\u2019s five wives.\nDuring the confusion, Max escapes the Citadel and eventually links up with Furiosa. The road warrior cuts a deal with Furiosa and agrees to help the women escape to freedom. The ensuing chaos is some of the most thrilling and captivating chase sequences captured in cinema.\nNonnas (2025)\nFood is love, and that phrase provides the heartbeat for Nonnas, a family dramedy helmed by Stephen Chbosky. Brooklyn native Joe Scaravella (Vince Vaughn) finds himself at a crossroads in life after the death of his mother. After receiving his mother\u2019s life insurance money, Joe opens an Italian restaurant in Staten Island.\nDespite having no culinary experience, Joe believes the secret to a restaurant\u2019s success lies with the chefs. Joe hires four grandmothers (Lorraine Bracco, Talia Shire, Brenda Vaccaro, and Susan Sarandon), or \u201cNonnas,\u201d to cook his mother\u2019s recipes.
