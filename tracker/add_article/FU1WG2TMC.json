      "summary": "First‑generation family offices often launch informally, over‑concentrate in familiar assets, and neglect proper tax and governance structures, leading to long‑term risk. Key mistakes include relying on generalist CPAs, hiring too fast or not at all, and storing spreadsheets in inboxes, which obscure liquidity and performance. The article recommends a formal charter, diversified core allocation, dedicated tax counsel within 90 days, phased hiring, a secure technology stack, and an investment committee with clear voting and distribution policies. It also stresses educating heirs, maintaining a 12‑ to 24‑month liquidity runway, and establishing mediation processes to preserve capital and ensure smooth succession.",
