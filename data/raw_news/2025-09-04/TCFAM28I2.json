  "title": "Synectics plc (LON:SNX) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong: Should Prospective Shareholders Make The Leap?",
  "description": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Synectics' (LON:SNX) recent performance, when its stock has declined 5.4...",
  "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Synectics' (LON:SNX) recent performance, when its stock has declined 5.4% over the past three months. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Specifically, we decided to study Synectics' ROE in this article. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early. So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Synectics is: 10% = UK\u00a34.4m \u00f7 UK\u00a344m (Based on the trailing twelve months to May 2025). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every \u00a31 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated \u00a30.10 in profit. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes. On the face of it, Synectics' ROE is not much to talk about. However, the fact that the company's ROE is higher than the average industry ROE of 4.8%, is definitely interesting. Even more so after seeing Synectics' exceptional 71% net income growth over the past five years. That being said, the company does have a slightly low ROE to begin with, just that it is higher than the industry average. So, there might well be other reasons for the earnings to grow. E.g the company has a low payout ratio or could belong to a high growth industry. Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Synectics' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 8.6% in the same period, which is great to see.\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Synectics''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry. Synectics has a three-year median payout ratio of 27% (where it is retaining 73% of its income) which is not too low or not too high. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the high growth we discussed above, it looks like Synectics is reinvesting its earnings efficiently. Moreover, Synectics is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of nine years of paying a dividend. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 30%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 10%. On the whole, we feel that Synectics' performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company has seen significant growth in its earnings backed by a respectable ROE and a high reinvestment rate. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals? Click here to be taken to our analyst's forecasts page for the company.

  "summary": "Synectics plc (LON:SNX) has seen a 5.4% drop in its stock over the past three months, but its financials suggest that the stock could see an increase in value in the long-term. The company's Return on Equity (ROE) is an important factor to consider for shareholders as it indicates how effectively their capital is being reinvested. The ROE is an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. However, Synectics' low ROE, which is higher than the average industry ROE of 4.8%, is considered an interesting factor as seen by investors who see 71% net income growth over past five years. The firm has a three-year median payout ratio of 27%, indicating it is reinvesting its earnings efficiently. However the future payout ratio is expected to be approximately 30%.",
  "shortSummary": "Synectics plc's strong financials, including strong ROE and high earnings growth, should investors take a look at its long-term value potential despite recent setbacks.",
