      "summary": "U.S. Senator Markwayne Mullin stated in a Fox News interview that he does not wear a seatbelt while driving in Washington, D.C. due to fears of being carjacked, a claim that contrasts with statistics showing a significant decrease in carjacking rates in the city. While carjackings peaked at 20.6 per 100,000 residents in June 2023, they fell to 5.1 per 100,000 by June 2025. In comparison, Tulsa, Oklahoma, where Mullin resides, had a much higher vehicle theft rate, raising questions about his seatbelt usage there.",
