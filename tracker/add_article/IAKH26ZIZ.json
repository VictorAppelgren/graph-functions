      "summary": "Florida announced it will phase out all childhood vaccine mandates, becoming the first U.S. state to do so, sparking criticism from health experts who warn that declining vaccination rates could lead to outbreaks of measles, polio and other preventable diseases. The move follows a national trend of increasing non‑medical exemptions, with CDC data showing kindergarteners’ exemption rates rising to 3.6% in 2024‑25. Public health officials argue that school mandates are essential for maintaining herd immunity and preventing costly outbreaks, while Florida’s new “Make America Healthy Again” commission seeks to promote medical freedom and reduce government involvement in vaccination policy.",
