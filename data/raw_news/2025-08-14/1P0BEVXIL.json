      "text": "President Donald Trump called in federal agents to help crack down on crime in Washington, D.C., but CNN's Harry Enten said new polling explains the real reason he has taken the extraordinary step.\nThe president called in the National Guard to help with law enforcement in the nation's capital after a DOGE staffer was carjacked and beaten, and even though violent crime has declined in Washington over the last two years. Enten said that Trump was cracking down because that was still one issue where he enjoys public support.\n\"I think that Democrats have to get it around their heads that Americans are far more hawkish on crime than they think that they are,\" Enten said. \"What are we talking about? Trump's net approval, handling crime, where was he last year? He was way underwater at minus-13 points, views of term Number One. But look at where he is now. He's on the positive side of the ledger, he's on the positive side at plus-one point. Americans view Trump far more favorably now on crime than they did a year ago, and while this polling doesn't take into account what's exactly happening in D.C. right now, it does take into account what happened in Los Angeles, what's happened earlier this year, and Americans, for the most part, actually view Trump favorably.\"\n\"Crime is one of Trump's best issues,\" he added. \"It's one of the reasons why he wants to talk about crime, because it favors him.\"\nTrump has blamed crime in Washington, D.C., on his predecessor Joe Biden, and Enten said polling shows the public generally agrees.\n\"I think this sort of gives the game away here because Donald Trump is like 'Air Jordan' towering over Joe Biden when it comes to their handling of crime,\" Enten said. \"Look, in 2024, look where Biden's net approval was on crime \u2013 way underwater. They're at minus-26 points. It was one of Biden's worst issues. Granted, pretty much every issue was one of Biden's worst issues, and again, look at where Donald Trump is: way, way, way above Joe Biden. What is that? That's 27 points, so Americans vastly prefer Donald Trump's approach to crime than they did to Joe Biden's, and again, I think it gets back to the point that Americans are far more hawkish on crime than a lot of Democrats want to admit.\"\nWatch the clip below or at this link.\n- YouTube youtu.be"

      "text": "'Out of the blue': Trump resorts to cold-calling to stump for Nobel Prize\nPresident Donald Trump randomly told the Norwegian minister of finance on a phone call that he wants a Nobel Peace Prize, The Guardian reported on Thursday.\n\"The Norwegian outlet Dagens N\u00e6ringsliv, citing unnamed sources, reported: 'Out of the blue, while finance minister Jens Stoltenberg was walking down the street in Oslo, Donald Trump called \u2026 He wanted the Nobel prize \u2013 and to discuss tariffs,'\" reported Maya Yang. \"The outlet added that it was not the first time that Trump had raised the question of a Nobel peace prize nomination to Stoltenberg.\"\nStoltenberg didn't weigh in on the matter publicly, telling reporters, \u201cI will not go into further detail about the content of the conversation,\u201d and saying that the call also included his U.S. counterpart, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, as well as U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer.\"\nThe president has for months promised to make a series of \"deals\" that will improve trade for the United States, using the potential reduction of his extreme \"reciprocal tariffs\" as a bargaining chip.\nThis also comes as Trump has ramped up his public comments on how much he thinks he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize \u2014 something that former President Barack Obama won shortly after taking office.\n\"They would never give me a Peace Prize. They only give it to liberals,\" Trump said during a news conference last month, while talking about the work he did in his first term to broker an economic deal between Serbia and Kosovo.\nA handful of politicians have nominated Trump for the prize over the years, but there has been no indication that such nominations have ever been under serious consideration by the Nobel Committee in Sweden. Trump's hopes suffered a setback earlier this year when a Ukrainian lawmaker who had nominated him rescinded the nomination, citing a loss of confidence in Trump's ability to end Russia's invasion of the country."

      "text": "Elon Musk is probably chuckling as Trump flails \u2014 the firestorm around the Epstein documents arguably started when the Tesla and SpaceX owner tweeted that Trump was in the files. Which has led to some significant changes in the Trump/media/politics/deep-state landscape that it\u2019s important to review. They include questions about the future of Trump, his cult followers, a possible power struggle between Trump and Rupert Murdoch, and JD Vance\u2019s presidential ambitions.\nTo begin: if you want everything around the Epstein furor to make sense, all you have to understand is that Donald Trump has been leading a cult.\nLike Jim Jones did. Like Charles Manson did. Like Rajneesh did here in Oregon. Unlike Manson, but more like Rajneesh and Jim Jones, however, Trump\u2019s cult is fairly large and preexisted his appearance on the scene. And that\u2019s part of his problem.\nIt\u2019s large enough to have in it three kinds of people.\nThe first kind of person is the \u201ctrue believer.\u201d They make up most of the Trump cult members, what we call MAGA. They\u2019re usually pretty much willing to overlook anything Dear Leader does, much like the devoted followers of Rajneesh and Jim Jones.\nAnd then there are the \u201cfacilitators.\u201d These are cynical people who don\u2019t believe the cult leader\u2019s BS, but go along with it \u2014 and even promote it \u2014 because it works to their benefit. They are typically parasitic. They usually make their money from the members of the cult, or get power from them (votes in this case), and often use their position in the cult to gain other benefits like sexual favors or fame.\nIn this case the facilitators are the Republican politicians who are begging money from their followers and voters, and then vote to screw those followers on behalf of the cult leader \u2014 Trump \u2014 and his billionaire friends. The morbidly rich keep the cult facilitators in line by funding their elections and, in the case of Republican Supreme Court justices, their lavish lifestyles.\nWhen you understand that it\u2019s a cult and that some of the people who seem high-up in it are true believers and not facilitators, suddenly Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s behavior makes sense when she seems to attack Trump: she\u2019s a true believer. She\u2019s completely bought into the conspiracy nuttery that brought him to office twice.\nYou also begin to understand why Chuck Grassley ran that Senate judiciary committee the way he did to push through Emil Bove over the objections of the Democrats and literally hundreds of former lawyers, judges, and Department of Justice officials: Grassley is a cynical facilitator.\nAnd you understand why the Republican congressman from Kentucky, Thomas Massey, has joined with Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna to demand release of the Epstein documents and essentially turned on Trump.\nMassey represents the third kind of person in a cult, who only shows up typically toward the early stages of the collapse of the cult, and then presents a real danger to the cult leader.\nThis third category are \u201cthe true believers who have suddenly seen a crack in reality,\u201d the false reality that the cult leader has created around them. You could call them \u201cformer true believers.\u201d Once they saw the light through that crack \u2014 saw the real world \u2014 they realized that they were being lied to.\nWhen a cult is on the verge of collapse, these kinds of people become more and more numerous as more and more people begin to wake up from the cult leader\u2019s trance.\nAt that point, they turn on the cult leader the way a spurned lover turns on the previous object of their affection. They become angry and vengeful. They demand answers. They want to know how they got sucked in and why: \u201cWho did this to me? And to whose benefit?\u201d\nThis is how Donald Trump\u2019s world is disintegrating right now, and the danger is that, like Jim Jones, Charles Manson, and Rajneesh, he may destroy a lot of lives when he goes down.\nHe may not kill them like Jim Jones did \u2014 although he already arguably killed a half-million of his cult followers with the malicious, incompetent way he handled COVID \u2014 but he will destroy many of the people and institutions around him. This is what narcissists do when they begin to psychologically collapse.\nAs I noted two weeks ago, my late friend Armin Lehmann was there when he gave Hitler the information that the war was lost. He stood outside Hitler\u2019s door when he shot himself. He wrote a book about it, and told me that Hitler wanted Germany destroyed by the Allies because the German people, he believed, had \u201clet him down.\u201d\nThis is \u201cnarcissistic collapse,\u201d which I\u2019ve written about several times over the past dozen or so years. Donald Trump is almost certainly going to hit this state of mind (he\u2019s already close), and many of his \u201ctrue believer\u201d followers are in the midst of their own personal narcissistic collapses right now.\nAnd that is what makes this a very dangerous moment for America.\nSuing Murdoch, for example, was an extraordinarily reckless and dangerous thing for Trump to do. Newscorp isn\u2019t going to roll over and pay Trump a bribe, in all probability, because he needs them more than they need him.\nMurdoch, after all, is the guy who created the cult that Trump has come to dominate: they\u2019re called \u201cFox News viewers.\u201d He created it long before Trump came along: he and Roger Ailes simply let Trump into it back in 2015 because he was good for ratings and thus increased profits.\nSo, once Murdoch decided that Trump could benefit his cult and make money for his television network (and even lower his taxes), he let Donald believe that he was the leader of the cult. And for many people in that Fox \u201cNews\u201d Viewer cult, Trump actually did become the leader.\nBut the real guy who controls the cult is Rupert Murdoch. It\u2019s not Donald Trump. Trump is just today\u2019s figurehead. Sort of like with the Catholic Church, Trump is the pope right now. But when the pope goes, he gets replaced.\nThe institution lives on, and you can bet your bottom dollar the Murdoch family is not going to let the cult that they\u2019ve built with Fox \u201cNews,\u201d the cult that has made them billions of dollars and given them the power to influence governments on three continents, dissolve.\nThey\u2019ll jettison Trump long before they\u2019ll let go of that kind of power.\nThe way Murdoch\u2019s father, Sir Keith Murdoch, first created this cult back in the 1940s was by feeding the readers of his newspapers in Australia a steady diet of racist outrage, fear, and anger. As historian John C. McManus writes in his definitive book Fire and Fortitude: The US Army in the Pacific War, 1941-1943:\n\u201cAs American soldiers began arriving in numbers during the early months of 1942, they were greeted with tremendous enthusiasm by the Australians, many of whom couldn\u2019t hide their immense relief at the soothing presence of the GIs. \u2026 Appreciative crowds gathered at piers and station platforms to greet incoming ships and troop trains. Waving and cheering, they studied the newcomers with great curiosity.\u201d\nBut Sir Keith Murdoch thought he could make a pile of money by turning Australians against Americans. Inflaming nationalist and xenophobic sentiments would sell papers, goose advertising, and make him rich.\nThus, as McManus documents:\n\u201cA chain of newspapers owned by Sir Keith Murdoch, father of latter-year media magnate Rupert Murdoch, earned a reputation among the yanks as relentlessly anti-American. Truth, a particularly brassy Melbourne tabloid, often published lurid tales of GI rapes of innocent Australian girls and seduction of married women.\n\u201cOn occasion, Australian soldiers vented their frustration over such tales with violence. Small groups of Diggers roamed around some of the cities, beating up any American soldiers whom they saw dating local girls. \u2026 An American soldier was even shot and killed one morning as he emerged from the house of a married woman.\u201d\nEventually, the hate against Americans that Murdoch had stirred up blossomed into full-fledged riots in multiple Australian cities, creating a real problem for the war effort but boosting Murdoch\u2019s newspaper sales (and, presumably, profits) into the stratosphere as his papers developed their own cult following in Oz.\nKeith then passed the cult and the media outlets that had created it along to Rupert, who then took his brand of cult-forming \u201cjournalism\u201d (Fox called it \u201centertainment\u201d when they were sued by Dominion Voting Systems) to England and then, ironically, to America.\nBy definition, people who live in a cult live in an unreality. A fictitious world. That\u2019s the key to how the cult and its leaders control them: they convince the cult members that they\u2019re the only ones who truly understand how the world works, that they have \u201csecret knowledge,\u201d and that everyone outside the cult is either blind, evil, or both.\nThis creates an us-versus-them narrative so powerful it replaces facts, isolates them from reality, and makes loyalty to the cult and its perceived leader more important than truth itself.\nPeople who watch Fox \u201cNews,\u201d for example, believe that what they hear on NPR is \u201cliberal propaganda,\u201d which is why they support defunding public broadcasting. What they actually hear on public broadcasting, however, is just the news. It reflects reality. Actual reality. But they think it\u2019s liberal propaganda because their cult told them so.\nIn much the same way Jim Jones\u2019 followers and Charles Manson\u2019s followers didn\u2019t listen to their friends when they tried to share reality with them or point out how they had been indoctrinated, brainwashed, and lied to, the people in the Fox \u201cNews\u201d cult don\u2019t want to listen to reality. They want the comfortable lies and the excuses for hate and outrage that they have wrapped themselves in for years.\nMurdoch now has to make a tough decision. He\u2019s already gotten most of what he needed from Trump \u2014 a massive tax break for himself and his family, and deregulation of the broadcast and internet space \u2014 so he only needs Trump now because Donald makes for good television.\nBut \u201cgood television\u201d can work two ways for a public official, for or against them. If Trump has sufficiently pissed off Murdoch, or he thinks that Trump\u2019s beginning to harm the GOP and thus the cult that the Murdoch family and their well-paid talent largely control, he could give Trump the old heave-ho.\nSo if Trump gets thrown out of the Fox \u201cNews\u201d Viewer cult \u2014 essentially gets fired as the cult leader \u2014 the cult will continue. It would simply lose a very small percentage of its hard-core true believers who\u2019d completely surrendered their personalities to Trump, and even those folks are probably retrievable.\nThe problem for Murdoch and other facilitators of the Fox \u201cNews\u201d Viewer cult that Trump now leads is who will fill the vacuum that\u2019ll be created when Trump is gone, whether it\u2019s from natural causes or an impeachment or 25th Amendment action that Murdoch and Fox could provoke. Who will continue to defend the interests of the morbidly rich and the monopolistic parts of corporate America and become the next leader of the GOP?\nJD Vance is unlikely to be able to fill Trump\u2019s shoes, which has to be giving Murdoch heartburn. Vance has virtually no hold at all on the Fox \u201cNews\u201d Viewer cult that Trump today dominates.\nHe is not beloved by the cult; if anything they think of him as weak and effeminate. He supposedly uses eyeliner. He married a brown-skinned woman and has brown-skin children. His wife refuses to adopt Christianity.\n\u201cHe must be weak,\u201d is the consensus across much of the white racist base that constitutes the MAGA-sphere.\nNonetheless, Vance himself apparently thinks he can take over for Donald. He\u2019s deluding himself, of course, but he appears to believe it. Just look at how he just publicly demanded that Trump\u2019s \u201cartwork\u201d be released by the Wall Street Journal or the FBI.\nHe knows a release of more damaging evidence of Trump\u2019s long-term relationship with Epstein \u2014 and thus, in the minds of the cult followers, participation in the deep state conspiracy that exploits children while it runs the world \u2014 could inflict incredible damage on Trump, and even make Vance president.\nWhat man who believes destiny and God want him to become president wouldn\u2019t jump at something like that? Remember, JD Vance said the following about Donald Trump:\n\u201cI go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon \u2026 or that he\u2019s America\u2019s Hitler.\u201d\n\u201c[Trump is] a disaster and a bad man. A morally reprehensible human being.\u201d\n\u201cFellow Christians, everyone is watching us when we apologize for this man.\u201d\nVance understood the cult even before he cynically pretended he was part of it when he saw Trump was prevailing: like most other Republican politicians and the billionaires who fund them, he\u2019s an exploiter, a cult \u201cfacilitator.\u201d\nIt\u2019s extremely unlikely, however, that he\u2019ll ever become the leader of the Fox Viewer cult; it\u2019s unlikely, in fact, that the subset of the Fox cult that has formed around Trump will survive as Trump followers.\nAs John Hobbes famously said, \u201cMen heap together the mistakes of their lives and create a monster they call destiny.\u201d With the Epstein revelations turning into a torrent, that\u2019s now the story of Donald John Trump.\nWhen Trump is gone \u2014 and that day will eventually come \u2014 his corner of the Fox \u201cNews\u201d Viewer cult will most likely shatter back into dozens of smaller organizations, many of which will simply be returning to their roots: Proud Boys, Three Percenters, anti-abortion freaks, rightwing preachers hustling their congregations, etc.\nAfter all, as Maureen Dowd points out, Trump has now become the deep state he once decried. He\u2019s creating the very \u201cFEMA Camps\u201d that had Republicans and Fox \u201cNews\u201d Viewer cult members hysterical when Obama was president.\nHe\u2019s developing a masked, anonymous, unaccountable nationwide secret police force and is compiling massive amounts of intelligence on everyday Americans. Between his spy agencies and data brokers, he has access to anybody\u2019s social media posts, emails, and medical and travel records. He\u2019s given ICE full and unfettered access to everybody\u2019s Medicaid and other government records.\nIf rightwingers keep protesting him or demanding more information about Jeffrey Epstein, they will be next in his crosshairs and that could begin the final stage of his participation in the Fox \u201cNews\u201d Viewer cult. He\u2019s already called them stupid, hysterical, and told them they\u2019re dupes for the Democrats, claiming he no longer wants their support.\nThus, we stand very close to what may be a true crossroads moment for America.\nIf Trump survives this politically, he\u2019ll most likely begin a serious crackdown modeled after the June, 1934 Night of the Long Knives (albeit probably less bloody), purging his opposition within his own ranks much like Putin did a decade ago in Russia and Orb\u00e1n is doing now in Hungary. It\u2019ll further damage American democracy and make it much harder for us to recover our previous New Deal and Great Society political and economic systems.\nOn the other hand, if Trump goes down in flames and Vance, Mike Johnson, Ted Cruz, or somebody equally weak tries to step in and take over the cult, it could spell doom for the GOP for a generation.\nSo get out the popcorn, but maybe you should also have something a little more defensive than that. Get ready. It\u2019s gonna be a rough ride, but in all probability we\u2019ll make it through without the kind of damage that Germany or the people at Jonestown suffered.\nWish us all luck. We need it \u2014 and citizen activism \u2014 now more than ever before."

      "text": "This week, when border czar Tom Homan threatened to arrest California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, Donald Trump goaded him on, telling reporters, \u201cI would do it if I were Tom. I think it's great!\u201d and adding, \u201cGavin likes the publicity but I think it would be a great thing.\u201d\nWhile Trump brays about having a Democratic governor arrested and Kristi Noem had a Democratic U.S. senator tackled for asking questions, someone should tell them that two can play that game. In the State of California, inciting public violence is a crime. Commonly known as inciting a riot, under California Penal Code (PC) 404.6 it is a crime to deliberately exacerbate violence by encouraging peaceful protesters to engage in violence. PC 404.6 states:\nAnyone who with the intent to cause a riot does an act or engages in conduct urging a riot, or urges others to commit acts of force or violence, or the burning or destroying of property, and at a time and place and under circumstances that produce a clear and present and immediate danger of acts of violence or destroying of property, is guilty of incitement to riot.\nEvery law enforcement agency in the U.S., including the FBI, knows and teaches that an excessive show of force will turn peaceful protesters into violent rioters, almost instantaneously. Recommended de-escalation methods are even published on Trump\u2019s Department of Justice website.\nNationwide police and FBI anti-escalation standards coupled with Newsom\u2019s objections to the military\u2019s presence lead to one conclusion: Trump sending troops into LA based on the fiction of an \u201cinvasion\u201d is deliberate provocation. Trump is trying to incite violence to serve his own political goals of declaring martial law, in violation of California\u2019s Penal Code, and should be arrested for same.\nNothing radicalizes citizens faster than being brutalized by state force\nWhomever is advising Trump in LA knows the quickest and surest way to radicalize any population is to use or display disproportionate force against unarmed people. A disproportionate government response to civic unrest predictably triggers anti-government sentiment, and causes violence that feels like self-defense. Military advisors know this, every police chief in the nation knows this, counterinsurgency experts know this.\nEvery law enforcement organization in the US trains its officers to de-escalate \u2014 to diffuse violence rather than exacerbate it. The FBI acknowledges, through its Crisis Negotiation Unit, that de-escalation is \u201ccrucial in keeping police officers out of harm\u2019s way \u2026 anecdotal and impressionistic evidence clearly reflects that this methodical approach to managing crisis events has saved thousands.\u201d\nThe FBI has provided de-escalation training to law enforcement agencies across the U.S. for the past 50 years, so it\u2019s impossible that Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Kash Patel, Trump\u2019s FBI director, are unaware of it. Trump may have deliberately chosen unqualified clowns for his cabinet, but every one of them has attended enough rubber chicken conferences to know the importance of de-escalation.\nBy sending the military into LA for what started out as largely peaceful protests, Trump is doing the opposite of what his own police intelligence counsels. Newsom is hip to what Trump is doing, and has made clear that Trump is putting the LA public, the police, and military members in harm\u2019s way. As he and the mayor of LA keep telling Trump, who knew it already, heavy-handed violence from the government never pacifies dissent, it causes violence to explode exponentially, which is Trump\u2019s plan.\nTrump\u2019s police state\nTrump has made no secret of his plan to recall thousands of American troops from overseas to station them instead on American soil. His goal, modeled after his fascist idol in Hungary, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, is to impose a police state under which the media, judges, and political opponents are silenced, imprisoned, or worse, for criticizing him. With tanks in the streets and Fox News propaganda running 24/7, Trump will be able to remain in office until he appoints Don Jr. his successor. Trump\u2019s objective is to remain in power, which he has admitted, to insulate himself from legal accountability until he dies.\nTo that end, he has done everything in his power since returning to office to instigate violence on the streets, and not just in LA. So far he\u2019s tried to incite riots by arresting a Black mayor, arresting a Black member of Congress, arresting a sitting judge, kidnapping brown people on their way into work, and sending migrants to foreign gulags without due process, all while filming and televising the cruelty as widely as possible.\nRepublicans are scared s\u2013\u2013\u2013less or they\u2019d stop this madman. Their cowardice is on display before the rest of the world.\nWatch what a member of Canada\u2019s parliament, Charlie Angus, just said in a formal statement about Trump\u2019s conduct in LA. Offering solidarity and prayers for the people of California, Angus delivers a full-throated indictment of Trump\u2019s police state, noting, \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about creeping fascism here. This is full-on police state tyranny from gangster president Donald Trump.\u201d\nIn a fiery (and delicious) 10-minute speech from the Canadian Parliament, Angus rages that a convicted felon and sexual predator dares to threaten Canada\u2019s sovereignty. Angus urges his fellow Canadian lawmakers to block Trump from entry into Canada and to bar Trump\u2019s scheduled attendance at the upcoming G7 conference.\nWithhold federal funds \u2014 and arrest Trump\nNewsom is correct to consider withholding federal taxes from a fascist president determined to defund states, universities, and organizations he doesn\u2019t like.\nA state withholding federal taxes is unprecedented, except for a brief period during the Whiskey Rebellion when farmers in Pennsylvania refused to pay the whiskey tax. It\u2019s also logistically complex because federal taxes are paid by employers and state residents directly. But what Trump is doing to destroy the nation is also unprecedented; 95% of his executive orders exceed his constitutional authority.\nThe state of California is the nation\u2019s biggest \u201cdonor state,\u201d meaning it pays $83 billion more to the federal government every year than it receives \u2014 nearly three times as much as the next biggest donor state. In addition, California taxpayers contribute more than any other state to total federal taxes, according to Internal Revenue Service data. In FY 2023-24, California\u2019s \u201ctotal federal taxes were $806 billion \u2014 nearly twice as much as Texas, which contributed $417 billion, and more than twice the $384 billion New York contributed.\u201d So whatever damage our toddler-in-chief hopes to inflict on California\u2019s governor and state economy will assuredly ripple throughout the national economy.\nAcknowledging that what Trump is doing to California is \u201cpure theater,\u201d Newsom should take his own advice. He can start with serious talk about how to withhold funds from Washington (because two can play that game too), and consider having Trump arrested. Even though a sitting president can\u2019t be prosecuted while in office, they are not immune from arrest or criminal charges or prosecution after leaving office. There\u2019s at least one precedent \u2014 President Ulysses S. Grant was brought into custody for speeding.\nThe point isn\u2019t sending Trump to prison, where he\u2019d be today if not for the Federalists he installed on the Supreme Court. The point is fighting Trump\u2019s theater fire with theater fire. Trump has cast himself as the strongman star of his own fascist reality show, but he\u2019s not the only official with the power to have people arrested for breaking the law.\n- Sabrina Haake is a 25+ year federal trial attorney specializing in 1st and 14th A defense.

      "text": "More than 100 protesters gathered late Wednesday at a checkpoint set up by a combination of local and federal officers on a popular street in Washington, D.C., where U.S. President Donald Trump has taken over the police force and deployed around 800 National Guard members as part of what he hopes will be a long-term occupation of the country's capital\u2014and potentially other major cities.\nThe officers at the Wednesday night checkpoint reportedly included agents from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which is also taking part in immigration raids in the city. Some agents were wearing face coverings to conceal their identities.\nAfter law enforcement agents established the checkpoint on 14th Street, protesters gathered and jeered the officers, chanting \"get off our streets\" and \"go home fascists.\" Some demonstrators yelled at the agents standing at the checkpoint, while others warned oncoming drivers to turn to avoid the police installation.\nThere was no officially stated purpose for the checkpoint, but it came amid the Trump administration's lawless mass deportation campaign and its broader threats to deploy U.S. troops on the streets of American cities to crush dissent.\nAt least one person, a Black woman, was arrested at Wednesday's checkpoint. One D.C. resident posted to Reddit that agents were \"pulling people out of cars who are 'suspicious' or if they don't like the answers to their questions.\" The Washington Post reported that a \"mix of local and federal authorities pulled over drivers for seat belt violations or broken taillights.\"\nThe National Guard troops activated by Trump this week were not seen at the checkpoint, which shut down before midnight.\nWednesday night's protests are expected to be just the start as public anger mounts over Trump's authoritarian actions in the nation's capital\u2014where violent crime fell to a 30-year low last year\u2014and across the country.\nRadley Balko, a journalist who has documented the growing militarization of U.S. police, wrote earlier this week that \"the motivation for Donald Trump's plan to 'federalize' Washington, D.C., is same as his motivation for sending active-duty troops into Los Angeles, deporting people to the CECOT torture prison in El Salvador, his politicization of the Department of Justice, and nearly every other authoritarian overreach of the last six months: He is testing the limits of his power\u2014and, by extension, of our democracy.\"\n\"He's feeling out what the Supreme Court, Congress, and the public will let him get away with. And so far, he's been able to do what he pleases,\" Balko wrote. \"We are now past the point of crisis. Trump has long dreamed of presiding over a police state. He has openly admired and been reluctant to criticize foreign leaders who helm one. He has now appointed people who have expressed their willingness to help him achieve one to the very positions with the power to make one happen. And both he and his highest-ranking advisers have both openly spoken about and written out their plans to implement one.\"\n\"It's time to believe them,\" Balko added."

      "text": "'Could not be bigger': Reporter warns Trump admin just handed Newsom a massive 'gift'\nThere was a huge show of force outside of a political event in Los Angeles on Thursday, prompting questions about the politicization of Customs and Border Patrol and immigration agents.\nJust a few weeks ago, Democrats were hesitant about redistricting California to eliminate GOP seats, while Texas was attempting to eliminate Democratic seats. That appears to have changed, as local, state, and federal officials, along with labor leaders and activists, stood behind Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) as he issued a shot across the bow of the gerrymandering battle.\nThe masked agents were nabbing people with zip-ties as the governor issued his smackdown to President Donald Trump, calling him \"weak\" and \"broken.\"\nSpeaking about it, Politico reporter Melanie Mason was asked about the update on the agents outside of the venue.\n\"Why were they there?\" asked MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace.\n\"I have to say that this could not be a bigger gift for Gov. Newsom,\" Mason said. \"Because, let's be honest, Newsom and fellow Democrats want to make what's going on now a conversation about Trump. And so by Trump sending, if that is what happened, border patrol or ICE to this press conference, it absolutely makes that dichotomy very clear.\"\nShe noted that the current debate goes beyond gerrymandering and makes it part of a larger issue about good governance and cheating.\n\"I think Democrats actually have a tough slog,\" Mason confessed, saying that they put a poll in the field Thursday morning, and thus far, the vast majority of both Democrats and Republicans want independent redistricting panels.\n\"But if this turns into a partisan fight, if this turns into a referendum on the Trump administration \u2014 and this type of ICE raid, exactly sort of, stirs up those partisan passions here in California, that's a fight that I think that Democrats feel very confident that they can win,\" she closed.\nSee the clip below or at the link here.\n- YouTube youtu.be"

      "text": "California is center stage on Thursday in the national battle over congressional redistricting ahead of next year's midterm elections.\nTwo-term Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom teamed up with congressional Democrats and legislative leaders in the heavily blue state at an event in Los Angeles.\nThat's where they unveiled their game plan to counter the push by President Donald Trump and Republicans to create up to five GOP-friendly congressional districts in Texas at the expense of currently Democrat-controlled seats.\n\"Today is liberation day in the state of California,\" Newsom said. \"Donald Trump, you have poked the bear and we will punch back.\"\nNEWSOM VOWS TO FIGHT \u2018FIRE WITH FIRE\u2019 IN CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING BATTLE\nAnd Newsom vowed to \"meet fire with fire\" with his push for rare\u2014but not unheard of\u2014mid-decade redistricting.\nNewsom says Trump missed a deadline to stand down on his push to redistrict in Texas.\n\"DONALD \u2018TACO\u2019 TRUMP, AS MANY CALL HIM, \u2018MISSED\u2019 THE DEADLINE!!! CALIFORNIA WILL NOW DRAW NEW, MORE \u2018BEAUTIFUL MAPS,\u2019 THEY WILL BE HISTORIC AS THEY WILL END THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY (DEMS TAKE BACK THE HOUSE!),\" Newsom wrote earlier this week in a social media post posted by his press office, which was meant to mock how Trump writes his own social media posts.\n\"BIG PRESS CONFERENCE THIS WEEK WITH POWERFUL DEMS AND GAVIN NEWSOM \u2014 YOUR FAVORITE GOVERNOR \u2014 THAT WILL BE DEVASTATING FOR \u2018MAGA.\u2019 THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER! \u2014 GN,\" he added.\nThe Republican push in Texas, which comes at Trump's urging, is part of a broader effort by the GOP across the country to pad their razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.\nNEWSOM DEMANDS TRUMP GIVE UP TEXAS REDISTRICTING PUSH\nTrump and his political team are aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House, when Democrats stormed back to grab the House majority in the 2018 midterms.\nBut while the Republican push in Texas to upend the current congressional maps doesn't face constitutional constraints, Newsom's path in California is much more complicated.\nIn GOP-dominated Texas, Republicans plan to enact the new maps they drew up once enough state Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to prevent the legislature from passing the measure return to Texas.\nThe governor is moving to hold a special election this year, to obtain voter approval to undo the constitutional amendments that created the non-partisan redistricting commission. A two-thirds majority vote in the Democrat-dominated California legislature would be needed to hold the referendum.\nDemocratic Party leaders are confident they'll have the votes to push the constitutional amendment and the new proposed congressional maps through the legislature.\n\"Here we are in open and plain sight before one vote is cast in the 2026 midterm election and here [Trump] is once again trying to rig the system,\" Newsom charged.\nNewsom said his plan is \"not complicated. We\u2019re doing this in reaction to a President of the United States that called a sitting governor in the state of Texas and said \u2018find me five seats.\u2019 We\u2019re doing it in reaction to that act.\"\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) charged that \"Newsom\u2019s made it clear: he\u2019ll shred California\u2019s Constitution and trample over democracy - running a cynical, self-serving playbook where Californians are an afterthought and power is the only priority.\"\nBut Newsom defended his actions, saying \"we\u2019re working through a very transparent, temporary and public process. We\u2019re putting the maps on the ballot and putting the power to the people.\"\nThursday's appearance by Newsom, who is considered a likely contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, will also serve as a fundraising kickoff to raise massive amounts of campaign cash needed to sell the redistricting push statewide in California.\nSCHWARZENEGGER'S NEW STARING ROLE: PUSHING BACK AGAINST NEWSOM'S REDISTRICTING DRIVE\nThe non-partisan redistricting commission, created over 15 years ago, remains popular with most Californians, according to public opinion polling.\nThat's why Newsom and California Democratic lawmakers are promising not to scrap the commission entirely, but rather replace it temporarily by the legislature for the next three election cycles.\n\"We will affirm our commitment to the state independent redistricting after the 2030 census, but we asking the voters for their consent to do midterm redistricting,\" Newsom said.\nBut their efforts are opposed by a number of coalition of figures supportive of the non-partisan commission.\nAmong the most visible members is former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the last Republican elected governor in Democrat-dominated California.\nSchwarzenegger, during his tenure as governor, had a starring role in the passage of constitutional amendments in California in 2008 and 2010 that took the power to draw state legislative and congressional districts away from politicians and place it in the hands of an independent commission.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Most people don't really think about an independent commission much, one way or another. And that's both an opportunity and a challenge for Newsom,\" Jack Pitney, an American politics professor at California's Claremont McKenna College, told Fox News.\nBut he added that \"it's going to take a lot of effort and money to energize Democrats and motivate them to show up at the polls\" and that Newsom's effort \"is all about motivating people who don't like Trump.\""

  "argos_summary": "California Governor Gavin Newsom is leading a redistricting initiative in response to Texas Republicans' efforts to disenfranchise Democratic voters, framing it as a necessary pushback against President Trump's actions. Amidst this political backdrop, Trump has deployed federal agents in Los Angeles, prompting accusations of inciting violence and authoritarianism. Polling suggests that Trump's handling of crime has gained him public support, contrasting sharply with President Biden's declining approval ratings on the issue. As tensions rise, Newsom's strategy aims to galvanize Democratic voters and challenge the GOP's redistricting efforts.",
