  "content": "Moving a car to a new location can be an overwhelming task, especially if this is your first rodeo. However, by keeping a few factors in mind, such as your budget, company reviews and specific services you\u2019ll need from a Delaware car shipping company, you can make the best decision for you.\n\nOne of the leading factors that can make a difference to both your overall experience and cost is the type of carrier you choose: open or enclosed. There are benefits and drawbacks to both, so the right selection will depend on individual needs.\n\nOpen transports are the most used ways to transport vehicles. When comparing options, the main thing you\u2019ll notice about choosing open-air trailers is that they are far less expensive than enclosed carriers. It\u2019s also generally easier to schedule service as there are more open transporters in use. The trade-off is that your vehicle is exposed to the elements during shipping.\n\nDespite higher costs, enclosed carriers are often preferred by customers who want more protection for their vehicle, particularly for antique or high-end vehicles. Fewer cars are loaded onto an enclosed carrier, and they remain covered while en route. Some companies offer higher insurance protection for enclosed carriers.\n\nCustomer feedback can be incredibly revealing if you know what to look for. To get the most accurate snapshot of a company\u2019s service, start with up-to-date ratings from customers in Delaware or nearby. Car shippers (especially brokers) may deliver very different experiences depending on location and partner carriers.\n\nDon\u2019t just scan five-star praise or one-star rants; the middle-of-the-road comments often offer the most honest insight. Pay attention to how companies handle public feedback. A fast, courteous reply, especially to complaints, can speak volumes about how they treat customers when things don\u2019t go perfectly.\n\nBefore confirming with any provider, make sure to carefully review the terms and conditions to avoid being caught off guard later.\n\nOne of the first things to check is the company\u2019s cancellation policy. Some providers require a nonrefundable deposit at booking, while others offer a free cancellation period. It\u2019s also important to understand what happens between pickup and delivery. Some companies offer guarantees that protect you in case of delays or other issues. Additional perks, like a free car wash voucher, may not carry major financial weight but can reflect the company\u2019s dedication to customer service.\n\nAll car shipping companies in the U.S. are mandated by law to carry liability and cargo insurance. However, the scope of coverage can vary widely. Depending on your specific needs, you may want to purchase extra coverage either through the company or your own insurer for added peace of mind.\n\nMost modern car shipping transport providers offer some level of GPS tracking, but not all systems are created equal. Some give you real-time pings, while others stick to broader general status updates at scheduled intervals. Before you book, ask how tracking works and whether updates come via text or if you\u2019ll need to check manually.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth finding out how you\u2019ll stay in the loop once the car is moving. Will the driver reach out directly? Should you call customer service if you have a question? It helps to know who to call and when.\n\nAs for timing, most companies can\u2019t promise an ironclad delivery window, but they should offer a general timeline. Ask how delays are handled and what your options are if the car arrives significantly off-schedule.\n\nWhile your car is being transported, unexpected setbacks can arise, making it crucial to check its condition both when it\u2019s collected and upon delivery. You\u2019re placing a certain degree of trust and responsibility on the carrier, but you also hold a key role: carefully examining your vehicle before transport and capturing its condition with clear photographic images.\n\nChoose companies that conduct thorough evaluations before loading and after unloading your vehicle. Many providers will ask you to sign off on their condition reports at pickup and delivery, often supplemented by visuals. It\u2019s wise to maintain your own documentation or request receipts for your reference.\n\nTypically, car shipping companies serving Delaware have the same requirements as those in any other state, since car shipping typically happens between states. Nationally, car shippers are required to have a USDOT number and a Motor Carrier number from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). You can ask for these to verify your car shipping company is on the up and up and to look into its safety record.\n\nA reliable car shipping company will understand the challenges and unique aspects of transporting vehicles in Delaware and your city. Don\u2019t hesitate to inquire about how the company vets its employees to confirm that they have enough experience to handle the many quirks of long-distance and regional shipping.\n\nSince car transporters cover extensive routes, the top companies employ drivers familiar with the demands of driving in Delaware and beyond. As a local expert, you know the conditions best\u2014so if you have issues concerning weather or other obstacles, it\u2019s a good idea to ask about how these hiccups are managed before scheduling your shipment.\n\nCar shipping companies either operate as brokers or carriers, which can affect your experience. With brokers, the company won\u2019t transport your car directly but will work with another company that will take your car from point A to point B. Carriers, however, will handle your shipment from beginning to end.\n\nHiring a broker isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, but it can mean varying experiences based on the company that ships your car. We recommend vetting any company involved in the process before moving forward.",
