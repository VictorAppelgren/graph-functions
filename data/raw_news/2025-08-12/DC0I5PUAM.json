      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock. It\u2019s not riding on hope.\nIt\u2019s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.\nThis is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!\nThe Reveal: Our Top Short-Term Stock Pick for 2025\nThis is the moment when most newsletters put up a paywall and ask you to spend $99.99 to find out the name of the stock.\nBut we\u2019re not doing that today.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nAt Insider Monkey, we believe in earning your trust first\u2014by delivering real value, upfront.

      "text": "In this article, we look at the Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks.\nStockpicking hedge funds are making a strong comeback in a market marked by volatility and uncertainty. Few embody this resurgence better than Bill Ackman. The billionaire hedge fund manager, founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, is known for his concentrated, high-conviction investing style. Ackman usually takes bold positions in just a handful of companies. While many funds follow the broader market, Ackman sets his strategy in a way that generates market-beating returns. He does so by betting big on companies he believes in.\nThere\u2019s renewed investor enthusiasm for active stockpickers, as equity long-short funds experienced $10 billion in inflows in just the first half of the year, according to data from Hedge Fund Research. Previously, the sector suffered more than $120 billion in withdrawals since 2016. Zlata Gleason, partner and head of client advisory at Indus Capital, commented:\n\u201cThe stock picker\u2019s market is back. If you look at the volatility underneath, it\u2019s like a rollercoaster. And that\u2019s where stockpickers can really benefit.\u201d\nWith this backdrop in mind, let\u2019s move on to our list: Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks.\nOur Methodology\nTo curate our list of the Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks, we scanned the stock portfolio of Pershing Square using its 13F filings for the first quarter of 2025. We ranked the stocks based on the value of the investment firm\u2019s holdings in each stock as of the quarter\u2019s end. Furthermore, we considered the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock, using Insider Monkey\u2019s hedge fund database, which tracks over 1,000 hedge funds. The list of the Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks is presented in ascending order based on Bill Ackman\u2019s stake.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:HTZ) secures a spot on our list of the Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks.\nHertz Global Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:HTZ) announced that it will release its Q2 2025 earnings on August 7, 2025. The analysts anticipate a year-over-year improvement in its earnings, along with a revenue dip. Meanwhile, Zacks projects a quarterly loss of $0.44 per share, a 69.4% YoY improvement. However, it expects revenue to decline to $2.17 billion, a 7.6% decrease.\nImportantly, the EPS prediction has increased by 4.72% over the past month among the analysts. At the same time, Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:HTZ)\u2019s historical record indicates caution as the company has missed the consensus EPS estimate for the four previous quarters. This includes a negative 3.7% surprise in Q1, where Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:HTZ) reported a loss of $1.12 per share.\nThus, the upcoming Q2 earnings release is highly anticipated with hopes of a positive earnings surprise from Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:HTZ), despite softening revenue trends.\nHertz Global Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:HTZ) offers vehicle rental services across the U.S. and international markets. Bill Ackman has bought 15 million shares of Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:HTZ) as of Q1 2025.\n9. Seaport Entertainment Group Inc.

(NYSE:SEG)\u2019s shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on June 30, 2025. The company\u2019s management expressed excitement as the move positions it to reach a wider investor base and drive long-term shareholder value.\nThis follows Seaport Entertainment Group Inc. (NYSE:SEG)\u2019s Q1 2025 earnings call, where the company\u2019s management laid out its future strategic roadmap. SEG expects to hit breakeven by 2026, profitability in 2027, and asset stabilization by 2028. This future growth is attributed to drivers such as the enhancement of the Tin Building experience with Jean-Georges, the activation of vacancies across the Seaport district, monetization of underperforming assets like 205 Water Street, and expansion of event utilization at the Las Vegas Ballpark.\nTherefore, Seaport Entertainment Group Inc. (NYSE:SEG)\u2019s NYSE debut signals both recognition of its past growth and confidence in its future outlook.\nSeaport Entertainment Group Inc. (NYSE:SEG), a leading entertainment and hospitality company, develops and operates integrated real estate destinations. Bill Ackman has bought 5.02 million shares of Seaport Entertainment Group Inc. (NYSE:SEG) as of Q1 2025."
