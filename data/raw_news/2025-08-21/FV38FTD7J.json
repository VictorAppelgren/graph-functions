      "text": "In this article, we discuss the 11 Best Gold Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds (and Precious Metals Stocks).\nOn August 13, 2025, the gold price rose amid a weaker U.S. dollar and falling Treasury yields. Softer inflation data boosted expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, along with an additional easing later in the year. As a result, spot gold climbed 0.4% to $3,357.59 per ounce and U.S. gold futures for December delivery rose 0.3% to $3,408.50.\nGold turned more attractive for overseas buyers, thanks to the dollar index slipping to its two-week low, alongside a decline in benchmark 10-year yields. With these developments taking place, markets are now seeing a 97% chance of a September rate cut following July\u2019s mild CPI figures and weak job data, which reinforced the Fed\u2019s dovish outlook.\nAt the same time, geopolitical factors remain a concern amid the upcoming high-level talks between U.S., European, and Ukrainian leaders ahead of a meeting with Russia\u2019s president. At the same time, the U.S. and China have extended their tariff deadline by another 90 days. Markets rallied following President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement. Analysts believe that gold prices surging beyond $3,400 would be driven by geopolitical developments more than economic data. Meanwhile, silver climbed 1.6% to $38.48, platinum eased 0.1% to $1,335.19, and palladium rose 0.1% to $1,129.89.\nWith this backdrop, let\u2019s shed light on our list of the 11 Best Gold Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds (and Precious Metals Stocks).\nOur Methodology\nTo curate our list of the 11 Best Gold Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds (and Precious Metals Stocks), we used the Finviz screener to extract a list of gold companies trading with a share price under $5. Next, we ranked these stocks in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock as of Q1 2025. We assessed the hedge fund sentiment using Insider Monkey\u2019s hedge fund database, which tracks over 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

      "text": "In this article, we discuss the 11 Best Rebound Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\nFollowing ongoing market uncertainty over tariffs and inflation, U.S. equities climbed to record highs on August 12, 2025, injecting a dose of optimism. A cooler-than-expected inflation report came out, reigniting hopes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate cut, which is expected to occur as soon as September. This sets the stage for a potential rebound in stocks that have suffered in 2025 so far.\nAn increase of 1.13% was noted for the S&P 500, which closed at 6,445.76. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.39% to close at 21,681.90. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 483 points, with small-cap stocks, which are the biggest beneficiaries of lower borrowing costs, leading the charge. Interestingly, the Russell 2000 nearly tripled the S&P\u2019s gains. While core CPI increased by 3.1% year-over-year, slightly exceeding expectations, investors remained focused on the overall CPI, which remained softer. Furthermore, the absence of major tariff-related price spikes fueled the optimism.\nAccording to CME FedWatch data, the probability of rate cuts in September now stands at 94%. Looking beyond September, investors are now expecting cuts later in the year as well.\nThus, the improving macroeconomic dynamics could potentially act as a catalyst for quality rebound stocks, helping them recover losses and potentially deliver significant gains. With this backdrop in mind, let\u2019s move on to our list of the 11 Best Rebound Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\nOur Methodology\nTo curate our list of the 11 Best Rebound Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we used the Finviz screener to extract a list of companies that are down on a year-to-date basis.

The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)\u2019s underlying sales growth guidance of 2.5%-4.5%, alongside EPS growth of 5%-7%, fueled the analyst\u2019s optimism. This update comes despite a post-earnings pullback driven by one-time pressures, which include a Mexico joint venture exit and normalized incentive compensation.\nLooking ahead, the analyst keeps its bullish stance due to improving U.S. local case volumes and long-term growth potential through sales force expansion, AI 360 CRM, pricing agility, and Perks 2.0. Meanwhile, on the same day, Truist Financial also maintained its \u2018Buy\u2019 rating on The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).

The cautious stance is attributed to broader macroeconomic concerns. Uncertainty stems from under-pressure sectors such as paper and pulp, where North American volumes slid 6% excluding a Georgetown mill closure.\nThe investment firm believes the global economic uncertainties could impact energy demand, alongside other cyclical industries. At the same time, Goldman Sachs remains confident in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\u2019s fundamentals, recognizing its scale and resilience.\nOperating through its Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products segments, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is engaged in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas globally.

Similar to the \u201cproductivity paradox\u201d of the PC era, billions are being poured into generative AI by companies. However, meaningful returns are yet to be seen. According to a McKinsey report, roughly 80% of companies are leveraging generative AI with no significant bottom-line impact. Despite the surge in abandoned pilot projects reported by S&P Global, IDC projects a 94% growth in AI spending, taking the total to a whopping $62 billion.\nHowever, this gap between promise and return is common, as new technologies often suffer from a \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d before taking off, as we saw during the emergence of PCs, the internet, and cloud computing.\nMeanwhile, within the technology industry, AI is helping companies achieve 30-40% delivery efficiency gains, potentially doubling over time. Looking ahead, the question \u201cwhich companies will lead the next era of productivity\u201d entirely depends on whether AI supplements existing models or reshapes them entirely.\nFrom an investor\u2019s point of view, these uncertain times hold opportunities to pick AI-focused companies that are oversold in the market despite long-term potential.

      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock.
