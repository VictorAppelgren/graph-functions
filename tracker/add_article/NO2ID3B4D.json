      "summary": "Boeing reported a significant improvement in its Q2 2025 results, posting a core loss per share of $1.24 and delivering 150 commercial jets—the highest second‑quarter figure since 2018—while its backlog rose to $522 billion. Production rates for the 737 and 787 were stabilized at 38 and 7 aircraft per month, respectively, and the company expects free cash flow of roughly $3 billion for the year. Boeing also secured a $2.8 billion Space Force contract and highlighted recent tariff‑reduction agreements with the EU, UK, and Japan that should lower input costs. Management emphasized ongoing production ramp plans, supply‑chain improvements, and a focus on maintaining high‑quality deliveries to support its long‑term margin recovery and $10 billion free‑cash‑flow target.",
