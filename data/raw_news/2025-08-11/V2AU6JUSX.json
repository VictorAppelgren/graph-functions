  "title": "Instagram's new Map feature is a massive privacy disaster",
  "description": "If anyone even notices they're using it in the first place.",
  "content": "The product designers in the Snapchat ideation room are rolling their eyes again. Last week, Instagram rolled out reposting capabilities, a Friends tab in reels, and -- a drumroll for controversy, please -- a familiar-looking map that shares a user's location.\n\nEssentially a 'take two' on its since-discontinued 2012 Photo Maps feature, Instagram created its own version of the Snap Map that lets you share your location with friends, family members, or particular followers. Despite the feature being \"off by default,\" it's allegedly showing up as automatic for some users. Besides privacy concerns, Instagram's pivot back to a location-centered feature isn't just a bad idea, it's completely irrelevant.\n\nBack in 2016, while everyone was scrolling Vine and making their own Caveman Spongebob memes, Instagram was making a getaway with Snapchat's secret formula: Stories. Just like Snapchat's feature, Instagram Stories disappeared 24 hours after posting. In a baffling move, the feed-based social media platform didn't even try to brand the feature with a different name. While the stolen goods didn't stick the landing right away, Instagram Stories did pick up its own identity eventually and slowly became one of the app's core attributes.\n\nFast-forward almost a decade, and Instagram performed the exact same heist (and lack of a unique name scheme) with its new Instagram Map feature. Perhaps it may take time for the location appeal to pick up like it did with Stories, but we already saw the 2012 Photo Maps flop after four long years back in the 2010s. Besides, stealing one feature was bad, and it isn't a good look for Meta to rip-off Snapchat a second time.\n\nYou're drifting out of your lane\n\nInstagram is the platform where users go to consume content at a lower engagement rate. You typically scroll your post timeline, get caught in an endless trail of Reels, and send and receive media (posted by other accounts) between friends and family. Occasionally, you'll make a post yourself or be featured in a post by someone else -- the same goes for Stories. The emphasis is on community, aesthetics, and viral content from people you might not even know. People tend to follow acquaintances, influencers, or even someone they met at a party in 2017 just once -- it's a much more diverse and casual platform that feels more 'shout into the void' than talk across the kitchen table.\n\nIn contrast, Snapchat is much more intimate. It's primarily used for more private, real-time communication with a specific person or group, and the app has always been more of a direct communication tool than a social media platform. In fact, I would actually argue that the Story feature does better on Instagram nowadays than Snapchat. However, I'll stand by when I say this: the Map feature should remain a Snapchat exclusive. Why?\n\nThe Snap Map complements Snapchat's conversational core -- if you're already in direct conversation with someone and want to know where they are, it's become intuitive to slide over to see where their Bitmoji is on the map. It's comparable to clicking on someone's contact in iMessage to see their location on Find my Friends in iOS.\n\nSnapchat is basically texting (with photos and videos) and maintaining close-knit or consistent connections. The Snap Map reinforces such connections. But location features aren't relevant to Instagram's model and definitely do not complement its timeline-based feed. In fact, the feature is relatively hidden and doesn't scream 'use me' at the top of the screen like Stories did during its debut.\n\nI have a feeling most of the people who use Instagram Map won't even know it's on -- especially if rumors of it automatically being enabled are grounded in truth.\n\nFirst things first, Instagram Map is an opt-in feature, so it's not supposed to be \"on\" by default. However, some users have reported that their location is actually being shared without opting in, and are sounding the alarm via Threads. The head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri, replied to posts flagging the issue and tried to reassure some users that his team was \"double checking everything\" and that people are \"confused\" about how the Map works. As counter-replies flood in, it appears to be some of that confusion on both sides.\n\nIf you open the Map feature, the first prompt you'll see will ask who you want to share your location with. You can choose between Friends, Close Friends, Only these Friends, or No One. Anyone with privacy concerns will typically choose No One. I think it's important that all users should double-check their preferences -- just in case it is an issue on the backend.\n\nShould this issue be on the back end, one of my major concerns (echoed by others across social media) is if this feature is enabled without someone knowing, simply going on the app can update and share their location on Instagram. Because Instagram is a more casual platform where mutuals sometimes follow each other without being close acquaintances, some users might have just had their location put on blast and leaked to people they didn't approve of having it -- even their home address. And since the feature drop was somewhat quiet, many less tech-savvy users may not even know that it's being shared.\n\nThis is actually dangerous for so many different reasons, but if someone is a victim of stalking or other dangerous behavior, it quite literally puts out a ping on where they are. It gives malicious parties not just information, but an opportunity to 'run into' someone in the wild. It's not safe, and if it's true that some users see it already enabled rather than defaulted to be off, Meta will have more than a major problem on its hands.",

      "text": "Summary\n- Proton Calendar emphasizes security, offering end-to-end encryption and zero-knowledge encryption.\n- It protects events with advanced security features, is independently audited, and is based in Switzerland.\n- The app integrates multiple email accounts, but offers even more features with a paid Proton Mail account.\nKeeping your schedule organized is important for everyone. You can't remember everything by scribbling it on your hand or jotting it down in a notebook. If you want to stay on top of things, take advantage of the free tools available, like Google Calendar or Proton Calendar.\nYour email provider might influence your preference one way or the other. Both suites offer a variety of apps -- Google Mail or Proton Mail, Google Drive or Proton Drive, and more. You can use either for writing documents or storing credit cards virtually, but both are great for keeping your events organized and easy to follow.\nSeeing as Gmail is the most popular email provider in the world, it's reasonable to assume many people use Google Calendar as well. There are some reasons why you might want to consider using Proton Calendar over Google Calendar, though. As is the case with all Proton applications, it starts with security.\n-\nProton Calendar\nProton Calendar is the calendar application used by Proton's suite of apps. It is an open-source application that takes privacy seriously.\n-\nGoogle Calendar\n- OS\n- iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux\n- App\n- Free\nGoogle Calendar is a scheduling tool that helps you organize events, set reminders, and sync across devices for efficient time management.\n1 The protections are built in\nThe Swiss privacy laws help big time\nOver 70 million people are registered for Proton Calendar while over 500 million are registered for Google Calendar.\nProton is lauded for its security features because of its open source coding. This means that you can go in yourself and make sure that things are working as they should, and you can see who has access to your information. Proton provides end-to-end encryption of everything that goes on inside its Proton apps, which also includes Proton Calendar. If you're logging a meeting or creating an appointment on your calendar, only you and the people that you share your calendar with will know that it exists.\nEvents are protected as soon as you input them into your calendar, as Proton has zero-knowledge encryption. Proton is also headquartered in Switzerland, which has strict Swiss privacy laws. It also has Swiss neutrality laws, meaning that what is protected by the privacy laws is not the government's concern.\n2 It has even more advanced security features than Google\nOnce you actually use them, the result is impressive\nProton's open-source coding is independently audited, which means that the company itself isn't the one checking what's saved in your calendars. Instead, a third-party auditor makes sure the program runs as it should. None of your data is stored on Proton's servers, unlike Google, which keeps calendar events on its servers and can access the data if needed -- which definitely isn't private.\nIf you invite or share an event with another person who has a Proton account, this won't even be known to Proton. This information stays between you and the person on the invite. If you want to use a shared Proton calendar, you can do so using a secure protocol. It will verify the person's identity through a cryptographic verification process, so both parties involved know who sent the invite and that it's legitimate.\n3 Integrate multiple email accounts\nThis doesn't only work with Proton Mail\nGet the most out of your email accounts by incorporating multiple into Proton Calendar. You might think it only works with Proton Mail, but you can integrate other email accounts, too, and make it your all-in-one calendar. It's an easy way to make sure all of your personal and professional events are in one place.\nYou can choose Google, Outlook, or Yahoo accounts to sync up with your Proton Calendar. So, you can actually link your Google Calendar to your Proton Calendar, allowing you to combine the two. To do this, you need to:\n- Open up the browser version of Proton Calendar.\n- At the top right of the calendar, click on Settings.\n- Click on All Settings at the top.\n- On the left-hand menu, click Import via Easy Switch.\n- Choose a service to import messages from.\n- You can choose to import calendars, emails, or contacts. You can only do one of these at a time.\nYou'll then be asked to log into your other accounts to okay the importation.\nNothing about your data is stored on Proton's servers.\n4 You get a free email address with Proton Calendar\nYou don't need to sign up with an email\nGoogle Calendar does offer you a lot of great features, such as overlaying multiple calendars, sharing calendars, and adding attachments to calendar invites. You can sign up with any email and use it as is, but many features work best with a Gmail account -- just like Proton Calendar pairs well with Proton Mail. The difference? When you create a Proton Calendar account, you automatically get a Proton Mail account, too.\nYou don't need to sign up for Proton Mail separately -- creating a Proton Calendar account automatically gives you one. This lets you send invites, updates, and meeting requests from a legitimate email address. Plus, you can easily add events to Proton Calendar directly from your Proton Mail inbox.\n5 Control what level of access others have\nThe sharing makes it easier to coordinate\nYou can add events easily with Proton Calendar by just clicking into the calendar and filling out the form that pops up. This will input your information and make the appointment known on the calendar. If you want to share your calendar with someone else, you can do so, but you can also limit what that person sees in your calendar -- you don't have to share your entire calendar with them.\nIf you want to share a work calendar with someone at work, but you also have your personal calendar integrated with yours, you can opt to only share your work calendar with that person. A step even further is that, if you only want to share a few meetings with that person, you can block portions of your calendar from their view. It lets you get more granular and provides people with just a brief overview of your day.\nYou can do a lot more with a paid Proton Mail account -- the free version gives you just 1GB of storage and limits you to one user, while a paid plan offers more storage and the ability to add multiple calendars. If you're sticking with the free account, you can only add one additional calendar. But even if you don't need to juggle multiple overlapping schedules, Proton Calendar could still be a great fit."

      "text": "Summary\n- Snapchat features disappearing photos and videos, but they are now introducing a Friend Solar System through paid subscriptions.\n- The Friend Solar System on Snapchat is organized with you as the Sun and your friends as planets, but Pluto isn't included.\n- You cannot see someone else's entire Friend Solar System, but you can track your friendship status with others.\nSnapchat is one of the most popular social media apps and has been since it debuted in 2011. The app allows you to send photos and videos to friends, and they typically cannot or do not save the files. That means that you can send quick photos and videos, and they disappear after the person opens them. While there are other features that allow you to quickly replay them, the novelty of \"see it, and then it's gone\" is what drives Snapchat.\nThe app lets users make Snapchat storieswhere you post videos and pictures to your profile for certain people to see, giving an up-to-date perspective on what you're doing, where you are, and who you're with. As with most social media apps, you can tag friends, customize your images with filters or emojis, and more. Snapchat has introduced video calling, group messaging, customized mapping, and other features since it came out, and one of the latest features is the Friend Solar System.\nThe Friends Solar System lets you order your friends in terms of how close you are with them and how much you communicate with them. It's an easy way to organize your closest friends at the top of your list when you're getting ready to send a snap. Here's more on the Friend Solar System and how to access it.\n- Developer\n- Snap, Inc.\n- Subscription cost\n- Optional Snapchat + available\nSnapchat is a social media messaging app that allows users to send photos and videos to one another. With features like video calling and Snap Map, it lets users stay in touch more easily.\nWhat is the Snapchat Friend Solar System?\nKeep your best friends organized together\nThe Snapchat Friend Solar System is a paid feature that is available only through Snapchat+ subscriptions. If you're a subscriber, you'll see the Friend Solar System as an option with your eight \"best\" friends, meaning they are the eight people that you send snaps and chats to the most. Because this is a paid feature, you also get to see where you stand in their Friend Solar System as well, providing you with intel on who they snap and chat with the most as well, sort of a throwback to the original \"Best Friends\" list from the earliest days of Snapchat.\nThe order of your Snapchat Friend Solar System is similar to our solar system, with you being the Sun in this scenario.\nTo toggle on the Friend Solar System setting, you need to have a Snapchat+ subscription.\n- Sign up for Snapchat+.\n- Once you've done that, click on your Bitmoji at the top of the home page.\n- Click on the Settings menu at the top right.\n- Scroll down to Snapchat+, and click on it.\n- This brings you to the Snapchat+ feature management page. Click on Friend Solar System to turn it on.\nSnapchat+ costs $2 per month for the first two months and then $4 per month after that.\nHow to understand the Friend Solar System\nIt does take some knowledge of our solar system to fully grasp it\nIf you have the Friend Solar System toggled on (it's not automatically toggled on when you first get Snapchat+), go into someone's profile that you are close friends with. If someone is one of your best friends on Snapchat, an icon will show up in their profile that states \"Best Friend\" with a gold ring around it. That means that they are in your Friend Solar System as well.\nThe order of your Snapchat Friend Solar System is similar to our solar system, with you being the Sun in this scenario. Your friends are given a planet that they coincide with in terms of how close they are to the Sun. For example, your closest friend is Mercury. Your next closest friend is Venus. Your third-closest friend is Earth, and so on all the way to Neptune.\nPluto is not recognized as a planet in the Snapchat Friend Solar System, so there are only eight planets available.\nThe Snapchat Friend Solar System is designed around your Bitmoji being the Sun and your friend's Bitmoji on top of their respective planet. The colors and feel of the planet coincide with what the planet actually looks like. Your friends are not permamently associated on their planet, as you can snap or chat with someone more to change their place.\nHow to see other people's Solar Systems\nYou can't fully see someone else's, but there's a caveat\nThere isn't a way for you to see someone else's entire Snapchat Friend Solar System. But you can see your friendship with someone else and see if you are listed in their Solar System at all. It's helpful to keep track -- you probably want to keep people in your Solar System whose Solar System you are in.\nIf you click on a friend's profile, you can tap on the Best Friends badge or the Friends badge. Having a Best Friends badge in someone else's profile means that you are in their Solar System, and they're also in yours. A regular Friends badge means that you're in their Solar System, but they aren't in yours. Clicking on either of these badges shows you your place in their Solar System."

      "text": "Summary\n- Safety is a top reason for sharing location with friends and family to ensure they know where you are.\n- Convenience is also key, making it easier to meet up or locate friends in crowded places.\n- Peace of mind is attained as loved ones can know your whereabouts, providing reassurance.\nThere are many reasons why you would share your location with family and friends. Safety might be the top priority -- whether you're going on a first date and want your friends to have your location or you're driving to a place you've never been before and want someone to keep an eye on you, it makes sense for loved ones to be able to follow you.\nConvenience is another. If you're going to a football game, and you're trying to meet up with friends at a tailgate, trying to describe the street signs or people's flags on their cars nearby can be more than difficult. Sharing your location can provide your friends with an easier way to track you down so you can reunite. Peace of mind is a third -- if you've ever had a parent who constantly wants to know what you're up to, even if you haven't lived at home in years, sharing your location is a smart way to quell their worries without answering a million texts.\nSharing your location has been a feature that's been available on many smartphones and in many apps. You can share your location on iPhone, Android, or while using apps like Snapchat, thanks to the Snap Map feature. Now, you can share your location with friends on Instagram as well, after Meta announced the unveiling of the feature. It does take some preliminary steps to be able to do so though. Here's how to share your location on Instagram.\nInstagram is a social media app owned by Meta that allows users to follow friends and popular accounts to keep up with what's going on around them. The newest feature is being able to share your location with others.\nWhat are the newest features on Instagram?\nSharing your location isn't the only new update\nMeta announced earlier this week that there would be several new updates to Instagram, including some new features. Sharing your location is only one of the new ones -- you can now add even more flair to your DMs with the announcement of 17 new sticker packs, which tag on more than 300 more stickers to your keyboard. Using stickers will be easier now, as you can 'favorite' the ones you use most frequently to keep them more accessible to you.\nYou can share your location, as well as a pinned location or a location you found using search, in DMs.\nDo you have a friend whose Instagram handle or name is incredibly long or complex? Maybe, there are a bunch of underscores in it or numbers that you never remember. Now you can change how their profiles show up in your DMs with the nicknames feature. In the chat between you or in a group chat, you can add a nickname for friends. This will only show up in chats and won't change how your username is shown to others on Instagram. You have the power to change your own handle to a nickname or give your friends nicknames.\nHow to share locations on Instagram\nThe feature is still being rolled out\nThe newest Instagram feature is being rolled out in specific countries around the world. It's been in beta testing for some time now, and Instagram felt it was ready to launch in some major markets.\nYou need to check your own Instagram settings to see if it is available to you, as it is not available to everyone, even in the US.\nYou can share your location, as well as a pinned location or a location you found using search, in DMs. You aren't able to share your location with anyone through an Instagram post, except for adding the location of where your post took place (which has always been an available feature on Instagram.) To do so in DMs, you need to set up location services on your phone.\nFor iPhone:\n- Go to your Settings.\n- Tap Privacy & Security.\n- Tap Location Services.\n- Scroll down to Instagram and tap on it.\n- Select While Using the App to be able to share locations.\nFor Android:\n- Go to your Settings.\n- Tap Location.\n- Tap Location Services.\n- Scroll down to Instagram and tap on it.\n- Tap App info.\n- Tap Location.\n- Ensure Don't allow is not selected.\nNow you can go back to Instagram and share your location. What you'll need to do first is click into a DM with a friend.\n- Open up a chat message.\n- Click on the + button at the bottom right of the conversation.\n- Tap Location.\nFrom there, you can do three things:\n- You can share your live location by tapping Share your location at the bottom.\n- You can share a pinned location by tapping the pin icon which drops it on your current location. You can then move the pin to another spot to drop it before hitting Send pinned location.\n- Finally, you can tap Find a place at the top (after you tap Location.) Tap Search and type in a location. Tap on the location and then tap Send Location at the bottom.\nSome important notes about sharing locations are that live locations are only available for one hour, and anybody who has been added to a chat after a location has been shared will not be able to see that location. Minors are only able to share locations with other teens or with adults they follow. When a location is sent, it triggers a push notification to be sent to those in the chat. After you've sent a location, you can stop sharing it by clicking Stop sharing location at the bottom of the message."
