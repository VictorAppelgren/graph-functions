  "description": "The 24-year-old was hospitalized in stable condition late Friday after being attended to for about 20 minutes by medical personnel at Mercedes-Benz Stadium during a preseason game against the Falco\u2026",
  "content": "ALLEN PARK, Mich. \u2014 Detroit Lions safety Morice Norris, who was taken off the field in an ambulance late in a preseason game last week, is in concussion protocol and doing well, coach Dan Campbell said Monday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take it nice and easy here to make sure he\u2019s good over the next 10 to 14 days and reassess,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThat\u2019s good news.\u201d\n\nAfter spending Friday night in an Atlanta hospital following the exhibition game against the Falcons that ended early, Norris flew back to Detroit on Saturday and returned to the Lions\u2019 facility on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt was great, everybody was fired up to see him. It\u2019s a breath of fresh air,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when something like that happens and you don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t tell you the number of times I\u2019ve seen guys with concussions knocked out \u2014 I\u2019ve had them myself \u2014 but when you have these and then you don\u2019t know. You know they\u2019re breathing, but you don\u2019t know anything else. And they\u2019re gone. It\u2019s just different, it\u2019s a little different because you\u2019re trying to block that out, but it\u2019s still there.\u201d\n\nNorris said in a social post Saturday that he was OK and thanked people for their support. He was hospitalized in stable condition late Friday after being attended to for about 20 minutes by medical personnel at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.\n\nThe 24-year-old Norris was hurt with 14:50 left in the game after hitting Falcons running back Nathan Carter. He hit Carter with his facemask facing the running back\u2019s midsection, and his head snapped back after assisting on the tackle.\n\nIn a show of concern and unity, members of both teams held hands in a circle on the field after the injury.\n\nCampbell and Atlanta coach Raheem Morris made the decision to not finish the game.\n\n\u201cWe talked to (official) Shawn Hochuli (and he) let us know that the game is still on. We communicated with each other, we told Shawn we\u2019ll be taking knees,\u201d Campbell said Monday. \u201cHe said, \u2018I understand.\u2019 And that\u2019s the way it went. Then the game was called.\u201d\n\nNorris, a former Fresno State standout, played in two regular-season games and one in the playoffs as a rookie in 2024 after earning a spot on the team as an undrafted free agent. He is competing for a safety roster spot with Lauren Strickland and Ian Kennelly, behind All-Pro Kerby Joseph and Pro Bowler Brian Branch.\n\nThe Lions and Dolphins face off in training camp on Wednesday and Thursday before meeting in a preseason game Saturday at Ford Field.",

She looked amazing, everybody was talking about her in great light, and on top of that the day went perfect for the Chiefs,\u201d Travis said at the time.\nSwift would go on to make several appearances at Chiefs games that season, including Kansas City\u2019s overtime Super Bowl win against the 49ers in February 2024.\nAlthough the Chiefs reached the Super Bowl in February for the third straight year, they were throttled by the Eagles in New Orleans, 40-22.\nTravis, who was all but invisible with 39 yards and four receptions, stated at training camp last week that he\u2019s \u201cthrown that thing in the trash.\u201d\nThe Chiefs open the 2025 NFL season against the Chargers in Brazil.
