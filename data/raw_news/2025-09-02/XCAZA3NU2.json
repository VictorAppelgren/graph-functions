  "content": "The 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles are three years away, but competition is already heating up for the city\u2019s mega-mansion rentals.\n\nVacancies in the city\u2019s tight supply of luxury home stays are on the decline for 2028, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nSuperstar athletes, oligarchs and entire company C-suites are coming to town, and they need better than an Airbnb.\n\nThe ultra-luxury vacation rental company LuxJB told the LA Times that three of their 14 Los Angeles mansions are already secured for the Olympic Games \u2014 and for several months surrounding the games.\n\nThe ritziest offering in the company\u2019s portfolio, a 39,000-square-foot mansion, is reportedly rented out from January to August 2028 for a total of $2.4 million \u2014 pre-paid.\n\nLuxJB\u2019s founder, Hank Stark, said his office is receiving multiple calls a week from renters eyeing properties in Beverly Hills, the Hollywood Hills and West Hollywood for their Olympic stays. The company\u2019s portfolio ranges from $1,900-a-night five-bedroom villas to $150,000-a-night mansions.\n\nWell-heeled spectators aren\u2019t the only ones demanding a dozen bedrooms, private chefs and views of the Hollywood hills.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an Olympic federation from a specific country, you\u2019ll be here all year training athletes before the Games begin,\u201d Stark said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a major sports brand, you\u2019ll want a presence in LA before and after July.\u201d\n\nThese renters are also competing with the athletes themselves. It\u2019s difficult to imagine some world-renowned athletes wanting to stay on the infamous cardboard beds of the Olympic Village.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t put [Cristiano] Ronaldo in a hotel room surrounded by strangers. He\u2019s the most valuable player in the world,\u201d Stark told the LA Times. \u201cPlus, our place has a $6,000 zero-gravity massage chair.\u201d\n\nNightfall Group, another luxury rental company that offers extensive concierge services, told the outlet that it has secured a $160,000 booking for the 2028 games. The 10,000-square-foot rental in the Hollywood Hills typically rents for $110,000, but booking early comes at a premium.\n\nLuxury rentals in La La Land are no stranger to early bookings \u2014 the city\u2019s rigorous awards season demands it. Renting three years out, however, is a rarity. For most hotels and short-term rentals, booking more than one or two years is an impossibility.\n\nThe short-term luxury market in Los Angeles is already tight, the LA Times reported. A swath mega-mansion rentals, already a rare commodity, were leased out following the January wildfires. Increasing restrictions on the region\u2019s short-term rental industry aren\u2019t helping, either.\n\nNightfall Group\u2019s founder Mokhtar Jabli told the outlet that rental prices are already 40% higher for the 2028 Olympic Games. He expects that number to climb.",

      "text": "Unexpected NYC neighborhood sets housing record with 3,700-plus units built in 2025 \u2014 and there are thousands more to come\nNew development in Downtown Brooklyn has reached a fever pitch.\nThe formerly 9-to-5 neighborhood is enjoying its biggest housing year ever. A record-breaking 3,700-plus units were completed there in the first six months of 2025, according to the most recent quarterly report from the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership\u2019s real estate team.\nThe recent report, first covered by Crain\u2019s New York, depict the neighborhood as a residential powerhouse more than two decades in the making. The 3,703 new housing units completed in the first half of the year \u2014 including 1,048 affordable units \u2014 shattered the previous record.\nThe last time Downtown Brooklyn built this much housing was three years ago, when 2,925 units were built in all of 2022.\nAppraiser Jonathan Miller, of Miller Samuel, said the area\u2019s evolution benefited both the neighborhood and the real estate market.\n\u201cIn many ways, this is a repeat of the Financial District in Manhattan, where the sidewalks rolled up at 5 o\u2019clock at night,\u201d Miller told The Post. \u201cDowntown Brooklyn is going through the same phenomenon, converting from a commercial district with residential on the side to a significant residential neighborhood.\u201d\nRecently completed projects include the 1,098-unit Rocklyn at 20 Rockwell Place and the 569-unit Everly at 180 Ashland Place. Thanks to the unit boost, the neighborhood now ranks No. 1 in the borough for housing availability on Apartments.com, surpassing Park Slope and Williamsburg.\nWhile the inventory boost is a blessing for Brooklyn\u2019s especially limited housing stock, Miller added that the significant uptick in new development \u2014 generally more expensive than existing units \u2014 will end up pushing housing costs higher.\nBut as the saying goes, if you build it, they will come. Residential foot traffic skyrocketed this year, according data from Placer.ai, which revealed a nearly 97% boost above pre-pandemic levels.\nCommercial development progressed at a healthy tick, too. A Nike store arrived at Atlantic Center and a Lidl location joined the ranks of the neighborhood\u2019s ample stock of large chain grocery stores.\nThe well-connected corridor has plenty to attract newcomers, like 12 subway lines, easy access to the Atlantic Terminal and a short walk to postcard-like city views from the Brooklyn Promenade.\nIt\u2019s full steam ahead for Downtown Brooklyn \u2014 an additional 1,183 units slated to wrap up before 2026, according to the report, and there are thousands more to come next year.\nIt appears that Downtown Brooklyn\u2019s most aggressive building boom took place between April and the end of June. The 3,000-plus new units built this spring account for a whopping 12% of all 26,853 apartments added since the commercial neighborhood was rezoned in 2004.\nThe 2004 rezoning effort sought to attract more office buildings, academic facilities and residential units with ground-floor retail to the area. Daily commuters to the borough\u2019s civic center became full-time residents, and restaurants and retail rushed in to join them. The neighborhood even got its very own controversial supertall, and another second massive tower is currently in the works."

      "text": "Katy Perry\u2019s legal fight is a warning for those selling or inheriting a family home\nKaty Perry\u2019s $15 million Montecito, CA, mansion purchase has turned into a yearslong legal standoff with the family of 84-year-old seller Carl Westcott.\nWhile it may seem like a saga reserved only for the rich and famous, at its core, the conflict is one that many families are facing or may soon face in the decades to come: What happens when an aging parent makes major decisions while potentially incapacitated?\nAs of 2022, baby boomers own 41% of all U.S. homes, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. As this generation ages, and their risk of age-related illnesses increases, more families may find themselves navigating high-stakes property decisions without a clear legal path.\nThat\u2019s why taking early action is so important, says Aimee Arce, an associate in the Trust & Estate practice at Fox Rothschild LLP.\n\u201cHaving the proper estate planning documents in place with the appropriate fiduciaries is crucial,\u201d she explains. \u201cWithout these important documents, your loved one may need to be deemed incapacitated by the court under these circumstances before you have the power to make decisions on his or her behalf.\u201d\nIf you stand to inherit or sell a family home, here\u2019s what you need to know.\nWhat happened in the Perry-Westcott deal\nAlthough a judge ruled in late 2023 that Perry\u2019s business manager lawfully purchased the $15 million Montecito mansion from Westcott, the case isn\u2019t closed. Perry\u2019s team is now seeking over $5 million in damages, primarily for lost rental income during the yearslong court battle and for alleged repairs needed to restore the property.\nWestcott\u2019s family, however, says the lawsuit should never have happened in the first place. They argue that the 1-800-Flowers founder\u2014who had been diagnosed with Huntington\u2019s disease and was recovering from major surgery and taking pain medication at the time of the sale\u2014lacked the mental capacity to understand what he was agreeing to.\n\u201cAn apology would be nice,\u201d said his son, Chart Westcott, in an interview. \u201c[I\u2019m] not expecting it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in her nature to take responsibility for anything.\u201d\nThe optics remain uncomfortable: a pop star demanding millions in damages from a \u201cdying man\u201d by his son\u2019s description, who tried to reverse a sale he may not have understood.\nIt\u2019s a reminder that even airtight contracts can come under scrutiny\u2014and that without clear estate planning, high-stakes property disputes can escalate when loved ones are most vulnerable.\nWhy the case resonates with everyday families\nThe Perry-Westcott story is more than just tabloid fodder. Millions of Americans are navigating aging, cognitive decline, and real estate decisions at the same time.\n\u201cThe legal troubles of Katy Perry reflect what I often see in ordinary residential real estate deals,\u201d says Kristen Herhold, director of public relations at Clever Real Estate. \u201cThe most expensive thing about selling the family home isn\u2019t the list price; it\u2019s the risk of a battle.\u201d\n\u201cOne contested signature or misconstrued agreement can lead to years of litigation,\u201d adds Jacob Naig, a real estate investor. \u201cEven though the stakes may not be $15 million, the losses\u2014such as missed time, strained relationships, and destroyed inheritances\u2014can be just as devastating for regular families.\u201d\nHe recommends acting as if you are before a judge when making any decisions.\n\u201cThat mindset results in cooperation, documentation, and clarity,\u201d which he says are the best defense in any dispute.\nHerhold agrees: \u201cThere is no telling how fast a dream transaction can turn into a nightmare when it is not at all clear who is really in charge of approving a decision, or whether that person can even make one.\nThere\u2019s also the matter of mental capacity\u2014whether the seller understood the nature and consequences of the transaction. Crucially, a diagnosis alone does not automatically mean a person lacks capacity.\nCourts weigh specific evidence, such as the timing of a diagnosis relative to the deal, testimony about the individual\u2019s clarity or confusion during negotiations, and whether outside medical or legal professionals evaluated the person at the time.\nFor ordinary families, the lesson is clear: Capacity disputes can turn a sale into years of litigation. Without documentation, independent assessments, or estate planning tools in place, even a routine home sale can devolve into a fight as bitter\u2014and expensive\u2014as the one now playing out in Montecito.\nHow to avoid the Perry problem\nYou don\u2019t need a $15 million mansion to end up in a real estate nightmare. If you own a home or expect to inherit one, every expert we spoke to had the same advice: Put a will or trust in place as early as possible.\nBut don\u2019t just \u201cset and forget\u201d them. \u201cIt is also important to regularly review and update your estate planning documents as circumstances change,\u201d advises Arce.\nDesignating a power of attorney or setting up a revocable trust allows someone you trust to step in when a loved one\u2019s ability to manage their affairs begins to decline\u2014whether due to age, illness, or medication. Without that legal authority in place, Arce warns, you may need to go to court to have them declared incapacitated just to make basic decisions on their behalf.\n\u201cElder financial abuse is an issue,\u201d she adds. \u201cYou need to be vigilant to protect your loved ones.\u201d\nIf someone is already struggling, don\u2019t delay, Arce says.\n\u201cIt is important to act at that time by having the proper estate planning documents put in place, if possible, based on your loved one\u2019s mental state, or by initiating guardianship proceedings,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou should also maintain thorough records and documentation, and consider mediation if disputes seem likely.\u201d\nBut the most important lesson, Ryan Dossey, co-founder of SoldFast.com, says, is never sign a document you don\u2019t understand or have counsel on.\n\u201cPurchase and sale agreements are binding, and a buyer could sue for specific performance, forcing you to sell a home you\u2019ve had a change of heart on selling,\u201d he says.\nMore wealth, more conflicts\nFor most aging Americans, their home is their single biggest source of wealth. As property values have climbed, so too has the financial incentive\u2014and the emotional weight\u2014attached to decisions about selling, inheriting, or holding on to a family house. Combine that with the reality of aging-related cognitive decline, and it\u2019s easy to see how disputes like the Perry-Westcott case can happen.\nWhat makes the saga resonate isn\u2019t the celebrity drama but the deeper reality it exposes: When families delay hard conversations about estate planning, the result can be years of costly, painful conflict.\nWithout clear documentation, open communication, and early planning, even an ordinary sale can spiral into a bitter legal fight. The Montecito mansion dispute may involve millions, but the cautionary lesson applies everywhere.\nAllaire Conte is a senior advice writer covering real estate and personal finance trends.

      "text": "The \u201cYellowstone effect\u201d is inspiring deep-pocketed buyers to seek out sprawling American ranches, and family disagreements are pushing owners to sell.\nLarge American ranching families are increasingly choosing to offload legacy properties that have been in their families for decades or even generations, CNBC reported. Ranch brokerage Live Water Properties claimed a 250% surge in its listing inventory over the past year.\nOne major Wyoming property, the massive and historic Pathfinder Ranchers, made headlines earlier this month when it listed for $79.5 million for the first time since it was assembled. The 916,076-acre grazing empire is larger than the state of Rhode Island, and occupies more than 1% of Wyoming\u2019s total acreage.\nAmong Live Water\u2019s other listings is the 40,000-acre Antlers Ranch in Meeteetse, Wyoming, available for the first time in five generations for $85 million.\n\u201cThe land is perpetual, but the ownership is not,\u201d Live Water broker Latham Jenkins told CNBC.\nThe Wyoming-based brokerage, which deals in multi-million dollar properties across America, saw its listing inventory skyrocket from under $200 million in May 2024 to $700 million currently.\nThe recent wave of sell-offs has been hastened along by the \u201cYellowstone effect\u201d \u2014 used to describe a notable boost in economic activity in the American West following the 2018 premiere of the hit Paramount series. The pandemic compounded that demand, as wealthy buyers sought wide-open spaces beyond their comparatively cramped penthouses.\nAmple supply of newly listed ranches is reportedly meeting that wave of interest.\nMultigenerational ranch families across the American West are facing a dramatic inflection point, CNBC reported, as the ranching industry continues its decline and growing family trees branch out far and wide.\nDeanna Davis, whose family owns the 7,600-acre Reynolds Ranch in California, told the outlet that disagreement among heirs over Reynolds\u2019 fate led to its $30.7 million listing. Given the property\u2019s 90-minute commute to San Jose and ample room for a landing strip, Davis said she expects a Silicon Valley buyer to come calling soon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult, the concept of losing the place, but on the other hand, it\u2019s going to make the next family very happy,\u201d Davis told CNBC.\nMultigenerational properties aren\u2019t the only ranches hitting the market. Bill McDavid, a broker at Hall and Hall, told CNBC that there\u2019s been an uptick in families offloading ranches they acquired only two or three decades ago.\nSome of these short-lived ranch owners made their fortunes in the dot-com boom or financial markets, McDavid said. In some cases, the sale is a matter of disinterested children who aren\u2019t following in their parents\u2019 footsteps.\nOther times it\u2019s simply a matter of capital \u2014 managing a ranch is a huge investment. Despite their grand curb appeal, legacy ranches require a lot of buy-in. Some wealthy buyers expect turn-key homes and convenient commutes, McDavid said, and they are sometimes met with outdated homes and hours-long drives to the nearest airport.\nBut the perks of owning a legacy ranch are undeniable. Rambling properties in rural states like Montana, Wyoming and Colorado offer classic Western vistas, daily proximity to wildlife, and unparalleled privacy. They\u2019re often surrounded by public lands, too, so isolation is all but guaranteed.\nSo, if you have $10 or $70 million to spare, now is a great time to dust off those cowboy boots."

      "text": "$2.4 million for a rental: Rich tourists are already booking mega-mansions for the Olympics\n- Share via\nThree years from now, millions of tourists will pour into L.A. for the 2028 Olympics. For most of them, a hotel room or Airbnb will suffice.\nSome require a more extravagant stay.\nTen bedrooms. Twenty bathrooms. A private movie theater and infinity pool overlooking the city. A battalion of chefs, butlers and drivers catering to the smallest of whims.\nThe Earth\u2019s elite \u2014 not just the athletes, but the royals, oligarchs and uber-wealthy families coming to watch them \u2014 won\u2019t be here for three summers. And the market for mega-mansion rentals is already getting competitive.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting five to 10 inquiries per week,\u201d said Hank Stark, founder of ultra-luxury vacation rental company LuxJB. \u201cThere are only so many homes of this size in L.A., and people want to secure their spot as early as possible.\u201d\nLuxJB owns 14 mansions around L.A., including in Beverly Hills, the Hollywood Hills and West Hollywood. Three of them have already been secured for the Olympics \u2014 not just for the last two weeks of July while the Games are taking place, but for most of the year.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an Olympic federation from a specific country, you\u2019ll be here all year training athletes before the Games begin,\u201d Stark said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a major sports brand, you\u2019ll want a presence in L.A. before and after July.\u201d\nThe crown jewel of LuxJB\u2019s collection is a 39,000-square-foot behemoth complete with nine bedrooms, four kitchens, a gym, spa, movie theater, pickleball court, basketball court and a team of three maids. A client just rented it out from January to August 2028 for $300,000 per month.\nThat\u2019s $2.4 million total. Pre-paid.\nIt\u2019s an eye-popping price, but there\u2019s a bit of savings to be found since LuxJB covers utilities. They run about $25,000 per month once you factor in heating the pool.\nThe home is on the pricier end of LuxJB\u2019s offerings, which start at $1,900 per night for smaller five-bedroom villas and $150,000 per month for larger mansions.\nStark said the rentals make sense for many. For example, a superstar athlete who travels with an entourage and wants some privacy.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t put [Cristiano] Ronaldo in a hotel room surrounded by strangers. He\u2019s the most valuable player in the world,\u201d Stark said. \u201cPlus, our place has a $6,000 zero-gravity massage chair.\u201d\nLuxJB is currently fielding interest from two Olympic committees looking for a large enough place to hold news conferences and host media outlets, as well as U.S. companies wanting to book houses for their top brass.\nStark said it\u2019s common for companies to rent their mansions for months at a time, and far in advance. Studios rent them for red carpet season during the fall and spring to host celebrities nominated for Emmys, Grammys and Oscars. Nine of LuxJB\u2019s 14 homes are already booked for next summer, when the 2026 World Cup brings a handful of major matches to L.A.\nBut bookings three years out?\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare,\u201d Stark said. \u201cBut rentals are disappearing, especially after the [January] fires, when so many were leased to house victims long-term. So I don\u2019t think demand will slow down any time soon.\u201d\nThe main reason why the market isn\u2019t hotter is because there aren\u2019t that many rooms or houses available yet. Most hotels don\u2019t accept reservations more than a year in advance, and rental companies such as Airbnb and VRBO typically don\u2019t accept bookings more than two years out.\nThere\u2019s a reason for such policies: A lot can change in three years. Homeowners can sell their homes, take them off the market, or die.\nStark doesn\u2019t have to worry about major changes, since LuxJB owns its homes. But other luxury rental companies, such as the Nightfall Group, rent out homes on behalf of owners, so three years out can be a bit too soon for some.\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped the calls from coming, though.\nNightfall founder Mokhtar Jabli said he has received a steady stream of inquiries since the company created a 2028 Olympics landing page on its site highlighting available rentals. They\u2019ve already booked one: a 10,000-square-foot home with six bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, a movie theater and infinity pool in the Hollywood Hills.\nFor the month of July 2028, the guest paid $160,000.\n\u201cThat house rents for around $110,000 during a typical year, but they paid a premium to book it so far in advance,\u201d Jabli said.\nIt came from a longtime client who knew which house they wanted and locked it in before it was blocked by a long-term lease. The owner typically doesn\u2019t take bookings so far out but was willing to make an exception \u2014 as long as the guest was willing to pay more.\nJabli said prices for Olympic bookings are around 40% higher than usual, but he expects that number will go up as the Games get closer.\nNightfall has rentals in luxury markets across the globe, and around 100 in Los Angeles. Its homes typically start at $50,000 per month, but the company also offers concierge services, so the house is only the start. Jabli said some clients pay $500,000 per month for swanky add-ons such as private jets, yacht rentals, security guards, drivers, chefs and housekeepers.\nThe company regularly hosts international athletes: soccer stars Ibrahima Konate from France and Amine Adli from Morocco, most recently. Jabli expects wealthy Olympic athletes in more lucrative sports, such as basketball or soccer, to book homes to share with their families rather than staying in the Olympic Village on UCLA\u2019s campus.\nAnother factor in the Olympic rental market is Southern California\u2019s uneven, sporadic enforcement of short-term rental regulations. Rules change from year to year and city to city, and a legal booking today could be outlawed by 2028.\nFor example, on Aug. 5, Beverly Hills banned short-term rentals entirely, requiring initial leases to be at least 12 months. Los Angeles beefed up its Home-Sharing Ordinance in March, calling for increased fines and more staff to monitor violations. But the city\u2019s scaled-back budget has put many of those enforcement plans on pause.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether exceptions will be made for the Olympics, when millions of visitors will descend on a region already starved for housing.\nEither way, the glut of deep-pocketed tourists should serve as a shot in the arm to a luxury market that has been waning since the COVID-19 pandemic. Homes will rent for thousands per day. Millions per year.\n\u201cL.A. is going through a crisis, both in the high-end luxury rental business and beyond,\u201d Jabli said. \u201cHopefully, 2028 brings it back to the L.A. we know.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "The 2028 Los Angeles Olympics are already driving demand for ultra\u2011luxury rentals, with firms like LuxJB and Nightfall Group securing multi\u2011month bookings for high\u2011profile athletes, teams, and corporate clients. Prices are up 40% over normal rates, and some properties are pre\u2011paid for months ahead, reflecting a tight supply of mega\u2011mansions and the city\u2019s restrictive short\u2011term rental rules. The market\u2019s early activity signals a rebound for LA\u2019s luxury rental sector, which has struggled since the pandemic and wildfire\u2011related disruptions.",
