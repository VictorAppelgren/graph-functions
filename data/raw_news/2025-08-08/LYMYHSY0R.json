  "title": "Is Wearable Tech Making Us Healthier\u2014Or More Neurotic?",
  "description": "In the age of the \u2018quantified self,\u2019 a growing number of people use health-tracking devices, for better or worse. Or both.",
  "content": "According to a statistical analysis by Market.us Scoop, a platform that compiles and evaluates technology market data, industry trends, and survey research, 32 percent of people in the U.S. are currently using wearable devices, such as a smartwatch, smart ring, or fitness tracker. It\u2019s higher among certain age groups (nearly 69 percent of those aged 25 to 34 use one). A survey analysis published in the journal NPJ Digital Medicine found that the demographics most likely to use a wearable identify as female and/or are Gen-Z.\n\nMost smart-device wearers use them to count daily steps, track other fitness data, or access health-monitoring features like heart rate, blood pressure, body composition, or sleep quality. Roughly 32 percent of users from the Market.us Scoop analysis reported a desire to keep up with the latest tech trends as a driving motivator.\n\nLike pretty much any technology\u2014or health endeavor, for that matter\u2014it\u2019s possible to take it too far. Over-reliance on wearable tech can mean placing too much faith in what it\u2019s telling you versus how you\u2019re actually feeling.\n\nOne problem is that a majority of wearables aren\u2019t official medical devices. Plus, they aren\u2019t always accurate, so receiving inaccurate data or misinterpreting what it\u2019s telling you could create unnecessary anxiety.\n\nIn a 2024 study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAMA), researchers looked at 172 patients with atrial fibrillation. They found that those who wore health trackers were more preoccupied with their medical condition than those who didn\u2019t. Twenty percent of wearable users in the study \u201cexperienced anxiety and always contacted their doctors in response to irregular rhythm notifications,\u201d which may not always be necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, another study published in JAMA found that patients who have cardiovascular disease or are at risk for the condition (who, according to the researchers, could benefit most from a heart-rate tracker) are significantly less likely to use a wearable device than other demographic groups. (Of course, the lower usage among cardiovascular patients might be age-related\u2014nearly half are age 65 or older.)\n\nAn additional study from 2024 looked at 509 smartwatch users who used their devices to track fitness and physiological markers. The researchers found that \u201cusers became anxious when their physiological data were abnormal and experienced dependence when tracking sleep status, heart rate, and exercise.\u201d (In some cases, \u201ctracking anxiety\u201d left some participants wanting to stop wearing a smartwatch altogether.)\n\nMore research is needed on the mental health impact of wearable tech devices, experts say. But there\u2019s growing evidence on the impact of smartphone addiction, with some research connecting smartphone overuse with higher neuroticism\u2014and there are some parallels to be drawn.\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re not using a smartwatch for health purposes but just as a more accessible component of your smartphone\u2014that is, one literally attached to your body. Research has shown that push notifications for calls and texts can be hugely distracting and make it harder to complete tasks\u2014not exactly breaking news, but worth noting. Wearables may just be exacerbating these effects.\n\nI previously had an Apple Watch, for example, and could feel my heart rate going up when I\u2019d get text notifications first to my wrist, then to my phone, then once more to my MacBook.\n\nI don\u2019t really like texting\u2014does anyone anymore?\u2014but I do find it a necessary tool, socially and logistically. Minimizing my daily texting minutes (by time-blocking responses to the group chats and muting alerts from everyone except my husband and our children\u2019s schools during work hours) makes me feel more focused, less uneasy, and more accomplished at the end of the day.\n\nOn the other hand, I love my Fitbit. My daily average for 2025 is 10,349 steps. Is the 10,000-step-a-day goal arbitrary? Yes! Still, does it help me stay active and offer a sense of triumph when I hit the mark? Also yes. That said, I despise notifications, so I\u2019ve set my Fitbit to function only as a clock and pedometer.\n\nI have an Eight Sleep, the smart mattress cover that delivers automatic temperature regulation through a water-based system. It\u2019s incredible for keeping me asleep, though I\u2019m not very interested in the metrics provided in its mobile app. Occasionally, I\u2019ll check how many minutes of deep sleep I got, but I don\u2019t need it to tell me when I slept well or poorly. I know when I\u2019m tired, thank you very much.\n\nFor some people, there are benefits to be found with sleep trackers: \u201cThere are a significant number of people who think they are sleeping \u2018better\u2019 or at least fine who then find ways to improve quantity or quality after tracking,\u201d Ed O\u2019Malley, an integrative sleep medicine practitioner and dynamical neurofeedback specialist based in Massachusetts, told The Daily Beast.\n\nBut O\u2019Malley added that many others obsessively track their sleep, fixating on every metric rather than tuning into how they\u2019re actually feeling. He pointed to a newer phenomenon called orthosomnia, when someone has \u201can excessive concern with trying to improve their sleep data, despite having no observable daytime consequence of their current sleep regimen.\u201d\n\nSo, what can we take away from all of this? Is wearable technology making us healthier, more motivated, or more rested? Or does it make people feel anxious when they see less-than-optimal numbers or get double the push notifications they\u2019d get with just a smartphone? The answer, of course, is highly personal.\n\nFor some (perhaps even most) smart-device wearers, the health and convenience benefits may outweigh any drawbacks. It\u2019s important to remember, too, that we\u2019re in control of how our devices feed us information. We can adjust settings, mute alerts, and forgo distracting features.",

      "text": "What if I told you there was a pill you could take every day that would lower your risk of heart disease, prevent multiple types of cancer, and even reduce your odds of an early death? That pill doesn\u2019t exist (yet), but in one of the largest studies to date, Cambridge University researchers found the next-best thing: 11 minutes of daily physical activity.\nYou read that correctly. Just over 10 minutes of walking, jogging, playing sports, exercising, or otherwise being active\u2014basically anything other than sitting or lying down\u2014reduced the risk of cancer by 10 percent, heart disease by 19 percent, and death by any cause by 23 percent, compared to no activity. These results came from a meta-analysis of studies that looked at more than 30 million people in total and was published on Feb. 28 in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.\n\u201cWe know that physical activity, such as walking or cycling, is good for you, especially if you feel it raises your heart rate,\u201d study co-author and Cambridge University public health modeling researcher James Woodcock said in a press release. \u201cBut what we\u2019ve found is there are substantial benefits to heart health and reducing your risk of cancer even if you can only manage 10 minutes every day.\u201d\nThe World Health Organization recommends that adults do at least 150 to 300 minutes of physical activity per week, corresponding to 21 to 43 minutes daily. But in the researchers\u2019 analysis, the authors found a dose-response relationship between activity and heart disease, cancer, and death\u2014meaning the more activity, the better. However, they found that even exercise below the recommended amount could have significant benefits. Activity that met the WHO\u2019s recommendations, meanwhile, was associated with a 15 percent reduction in cancer risk, 29 percent reduction in cardiovascular disease, and a 31 percent reduction in death compared to no activity.\n\u201cIf you are someone who finds the idea of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a week a bit daunting, then our findings should be good news,\u201d Cambridge University physical activity epidemiologist and study co-author Soren Brage said in the press release.\nTwo years ago, another meta-analysis from a group in Norway looked at how both activity and sedentary time affected the risk of death in studies with a combined total of over 44,000 people. Being sedentary for long periods of time increased participants\u2019 risk of death, though high levels of physical activity could counteract some of these negative effects, the researchers found.\nIf this all sounds unbelievable, know that there are reasons to be cautious about the findings. First off, the risk reductions presented by the authors might seem high because they\u2019re compared to the very uncommon (if not altogether implausible) situation of a person getting absolutely zero physical activity per week. Still, there were meaningful comparisons to draw between more relevant groups of people: For instance, a person who is active for 21 minutes a day had an 8 percent lower risk for death, compared to one who is active for 11 minutes.\nBoth this meta-analysis and the 2020 one rely on observational study data, meaning participants are not being asked to change their habits. Due to this, the researchers cannot be certain they have controlled for potential inherent differences between more and less active people.\nIn the study, the researchers attribute at least a portion of the stark findings to a phenomenon called reverse causality. What this means is that the outcomes they studied\u2014and specifically, cancer diagnoses\u2014could cause a person to be less physically active, rather than the other way around. For example, cancer is likely to make a person less physically active because of the \u201coften-prolonged trajectory toward disability and illness,\u201d according to the authors of a JAMA Oncology comment. Cancer, in turn, also increases a person\u2019s risk of death.\nAdditionally, some studies they analyzed excluded people with underlying conditions, while others did not; the authors reported that studies that did not exclude people based on pre-existing conditions tended to see stronger associations between physical activity and death, heart disease, or cancer, bolstering the evidence for reverse causality.\nEven so, it is likely that physical activity plays a role in preventing cancer, heart disease, cancer, and ultimately death. Exercise can improve heart health by slowing a person\u2019s heart rate, lowering their blood pressure, and increasing levels of \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol. And according to the National Cancer Institute, physical activity can lower certain hormones and signaling molecules, reduce inflammation, and improve the immune system\u2014all of which may decrease the risk of cancer and its progression.\nOr, as Brage put it: \u201cDoing some physical activity is better than doing none.\u201d"

What you\u2019re probably less aware of is the fact that the walking goal meant to encourage you to be more active throughout the day actually originated as a marketing ploy in the 1960s by a Japanese pedometer manufacturer.\nThe truth is you don\u2019t need 10,000 steps a day to stay healthy\u2014and the actual number of steps is actually far lower.\nA comprehensive analysis published Tuesday in the journal European Journal of Preventive Cardiology found that walking at least 3,967 steps a day reduced the risk of dying from any cause. The authors also found that as little as 2,337 steps a day reduced the risk of dying from cardiovascular diseases.\nHowever, they also found that overall health improved the more you walked each day as well\u2014with fitness benefits improving even if you walked as much as 20,000 steps each day. The findings apply across genders, age, and regions of the world you live in.\n\u201cOur study confirms that the more you walk, the better,\u201d lead author Maciej Banach, a cardiology professor at the Medical University of Lodz, Poland, said in a statement. He added that the study \u201cindicates that as little as 4,000 steps a day are needed to significantly reduce deaths from any cause, and even fewer to reduce deaths from cardiovascular disease.\u201d\nThe paper looked at 17 studies across the globe that included nearly 227,000 participants. The researchers discovered that the risk of dying from any cause dropped dramatically with every 500 to 1000 extra steps a person walks. Every 500 steps was linked to a 7 percent reduced risk of dying from cardiovascular diseases while 1000 steps was linked to a 15 percent reduced risk of dying from any cause.\nAdditionally, researchers have yet to discover a ceiling for the health benefits. However, the authors did caution that there was limited data available for step counts up to 20,000 steps a day. More research will be needed in order to find out the most optimal amount of steps to take each day in order to get the most health benefits.\nWhile the paper said that there are benefits regardless of gender, age, and location of participants, it did note that people younger than 60 years old saw a much larger reduced risk in death. Adults older than 60 showed a 42 percent reduction in death risk when walking between 6,000 and 10,000 steps a day. However, younger adults had a 49 percent reduction in death risk when walking between 7,000 and 13,000 steps a day.\nThere were a few limitations to keep in mind though. For one, it\u2019s just an observational study so it hasn\u2019t proved conclusively that walking more and increasing your step count will decrease your risk of death. The study\u2019s participants were also healthy when the studies were conducted, so it didn\u2019t account for disease and illnesses. The paper also didn\u2019t factor in race and socioeconomic status of the participants\u2014two factors that have been shown to be linked to adverse health events.\nHowever, the paper underscores the importance and outsized impact that living a slightly more active lifestyle could have on human health. It also adds to the body of research showing the harms of a sedentary lifestyle. For example, a 2020 paper in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that more sedentary time was linked to increased risk of death.\n\u201cWe still need good studies to investigate whether these benefits may exist for intensive types of exertion, such as marathon running and iron man challenges, and in different populations of different ages, and with different associated health problems,\u201d Banach said. \u201cHowever, it seems that, as with pharmacological treatments, we should always think about personalizing lifestyle changes.\u201d"

      "text": "Remember the 1990s, when mood rings were having a moment? Well, what\u2019s old is new again, except with a high-tech twist: Instead of color-changing stones to indicate shifting emotions, today\u2019s \u201cmodern mood rings\u201d use physiological data to flag moments of stress, excitement, despair, and more.\nYou might even be wearing one right now: They may be literal rings, like the upcoming Happy Ring, watches like the Fitbit Sense 2 or Upmood, or wristbands like Feel. Their goal isn\u2019t just to get you moving, like most wearables people have become familiar with, but to integrate emotional assessment and stress management into daily life. While those insights can help users be more aware of their mental health, experts warn they\u2019re no panacea\u2014even if some brands might attempt to convince you otherwise.\n\u201cPsychologists have been using this type of biofeedback since at least the 1950s,\u201d psychophysiologist Nicole Prause told The Daily Beast. \u201cThe technology in many ways hasn\u2019t changed, but the ability to send signals, record signals, and display those signals in pretty ways has gotten much better.\u201d\nMost of these devices track a wearer\u2019s electrodermal activity (EDA)\u2014or how the electrical properties of the skin change due to sweat gland activity, Prause explained. Sweat level is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, which are the network of nerves that activate your body\u2019s fight or flight response. Real-time changes in sweat can indicate how your body is responding to stress.\nIt\u2019s similar to how your heartbeat speeds up when you\u2019re excited or anxious, and slows when you\u2019re relaxed. That\u2019s why other devices use your heart rate to track stress responses. \u201cNumerous studies have reported a strong correlation between stress and heart rate variability, making it a well-established metric for mental health assessment,\u201d machine learning engineer Ruixuan (Corey) Dai, co-author of a recent study on detecting mental disorders with wearables, told The Daily Beast.\nFor example, the Happy Ring feeds EDA data into an algorithm that helps identify a user\u2019s emotional state, while the wristband Feel translates EDA, heart rate variability, and skin temperature data to quantify users\u2019 emotional status; and Upmood, a wearable available as either a band or watch, tracks biometric patterns of the heart, then interprets it into emotional states.\nHowever, the accuracy of the devices is still up for debate. A 2022 paper published in the journal JMIR Formative Research found that machine learning models identified depression with around 80 percent accuracy from how people interacted with their smartphone and their app usage. Dai suggested that \u201cthe accuracy of wearable devices in providing feedback on emotional and mental health is likely to be higher\u201d because they\u2019re worn continuously and use more sensors that provide more comprehensive physiological data.\n\u201cThis abundance of data enables more effective monitoring and assessment of mental health,\u201d Dai explained.\nHowever, it\u2019s not that simple\u2014as most human emotions tend to be. \u201cEmotion is defined along two axes: how pleasant the emotion is, from unpleasant to very pleasant; and how intense the emotion is, from not at all intense to very intense,\u201d Prause explained. \u201cThese devices do absolutely nothing on the first axis, but they\u2019ve got lots of game on the second axis.\u201d\nSo while wearables can detect moments of physiological stress, they can\u2019t tell you if that\u2019s positive or negative. That\u2019s up to you.\nThe Fitbit Sense 2 smartwatch\u2019s algorithm, for example, combines heart rate, heart rate variability (changes in time interval between beats), skin temperature, and EDA\u2014but the wearer has to fill out an assessment and \u201crate\u201d their mood via one of the preset choices, ranging from very calm to very stressed in the partner app to assign the associated emotions.\nOn the Apple Watch\u2014which doesn\u2019t automatically track mood, but does track 24/7 heart rate and heart rate variability\u2014you can use the digital crown to scroll through a range of emotions in order to log how you feel; and you can also add notes about why you feel that way.\n\u201cContext is absolutely essential to interpreting anything you get from an emotion-tracking wearable\u2014they will not tell you anything about what emotion you\u2019re having,\u201d Prause said. \u201cThat\u2019s up to you to interpret and understand.\u201d\nCase in point: If you start making out with your partner, that\u2019s going to spike your heart rate in the same way an onset of anxiety would before making a presentation at work. One is a good stress response, the other not so good.\nBut that doesn\u2019t make emotion-tracking devices any less valuable as a mental health tool. In fact, Dai\u2019s research, presented at the International Conference on Internet-of-Things Design and Implementation in May 2023, touted \"the feasibility and promise of using wearables to detect mental disorders.\u201d\n\u201cBy harnessing data from these devices, individuals can closely monitor changes in their lifestyle and identify deviations that may indicate potential mental health concerns,\u201d Dai said. Plus, \u201cdoctors can leverage the wealth of data collected by wearables as a diagnostic resource for identifying and characterizing mental disorders, which can inform personalized mental health treatment strategies, thus improving the efficiency of the treatment.\u201d\nWhat these modern mood rings really do is increase self-awareness around mental status, identify triggers, and promote action. Over time, they can help you identify patterns that allow you to anticipate potential stress and plan ahead, and take action in ways that can mitigate future stress responses.\nSay you notice you have a habit of ruminating, or dwelling on negative feelings, before you interact with a certain family member; once you\u2019ve identified that pattern, you can learn how to decrease it. For example, Fitbit provides guided breathing and meditation sessions and Upmood generates actionable insights to help wearer\u2019s boost their mood, or you can use interventions suggested by your own therapist\u2014and see how your body reacts in real-time.\nJust keep in mind that no piece of tech is a replacement for therapy or other mental health interventions. Just like buying a sleep tracker won\u2019t guarantee a better night\u2019s sleep, a wearable that tracks emotions won\u2019t guarantee better emotions. It\u2019s just a tool at the end of the day.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no empirically supported treatment that includes these devices,\u201d Prause said. \u201cBut anything that\u2019s going to help you engage in a practice that is known to be helpful is going to be useful.\u201d"

      "text": "- 1Department of Molecular Psychology, Institute of Psychology and Education, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany\n- 2Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia\nMounting evidence suggests that smartphone overuse/smartphone use disorder (SmUD) is associated with negative affectivity. Given a large number of smartphone users worldwide (currently about 4.7 billion) and the fact that many individuals carry their smartphones around 24/7, it is of high importance to better understand the phenomenon of smartphone overuse. Based on the interaction of person-affect-cognition-execution (I-PACE) model, we investigated the links between SmUD and the personality traits, neuroticism and conscientiousness, which represent two vulnerability factors robustly linked to SmUD according to a recent meta-analysis. Beyond that, we tested the effects of mind-wandering (MW) and fear of missing out (FoMO) in the relation between individual differences in personality and tendencies towards SmUD. The effective sample comprised 414 study participants (151 men and 263 women, age M = 33.6, SD = 13.5). By applying a structural equation modeling (SEM) technique, we observed that the associations of higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness with higher levels of SmUD were mediated by higher scores in mind-wandering. These novel findings can help to understand the associations between personality and SmUD in more detail.\nIntroduction\nSmartphone Use and Smartphone Use Disorder\nCurrently, there are 4.7 billion smartphone users worldwide (Statista, 2021), and this technology may spread around the globe faster than any other we have seen so far (DeGusta, 2012). Without doubt, this mobile device provides a variety of advantages, such as the opportunity to stay in touch with beloved ones via far distances. It can also increase productivity (Bertschek and Niebel, 2016; Lee et al., 2017), for instance, by allowing for more efficient navigation in unknown territory. On the other hand, mounting evidence suggests that smartphone use can also be harmful, which is currently being intensely investigated and debated among researchers. One of the downsides of the increasing incorporation of smartphones in everyday life is the phenomenon of smartphone overuse. A broader literature overview on the detrimental effects including social, psychological and physical problems, next to comorbidities as well as mental health issues (such as stress, depression, and anxiety) examined in the realm of smartphone overuse is provided in the works of Guti\u00e9rrez et al. (2016) and Elhai et al. (2019).\nCommonly used measurement tools for smartphone overuse originate from traditional substance-abuse criteria [for a description of different tools, see Billieux (2012)], as we did in this study, for reasons of comparability (Kwon et al., 2013). This is why smartphone overuse is often denoted as \u201csmartphone addiction\u201d (Ting and Chen, 2020). However, researchers still lack consensus on a conceptual definition of smartphone overuse (Billieux et al., 2015; Panova and Carbonell, 2018). This is also reflected by the variety of existing terms in the literature to capture this phenomenon arising from the field of \u201ccyber addictions\u201d (Suissa, 2014) or \u201ctechnological addictions\u201d (Griffiths, 1995; Carbonell et al., 2016; Kuss and Billieux, 2017). Some adjectives used to describe smartphone overuse include \u201ccompulsive,\u201d \u201cpathological,\u201d \u201cexcessive,\u201d \u201cdysfunctional,\u201d and \u201cproblematic\u201d (Billieux, 2012; Elhai et al., 2017; van Velthoven et al., 2018). For consistency, we will use the term smartphone use disorder (SmUD), as discussed in Montag et al. (2021).\nA recent taxonomy introduced in the review article just mentioned stresses the relevance to distinguish between non-mobile and mobile versions of Internet-use disorder (IUD); SmUD can be characterized as a mobile version of IUD (Montag et al., 2021). By being constantly connected to the Internet, the smartphone provides users with ubiquitous access to the online world as long as there is reception. According to current conceptualizations, there are generalized (non-specific) and specific IUDs. Generalized (non-specific) IUD deals with the general overuse of the Internet (e.g., browsing or aimlessly surfing the Internet). Specific IUDs deal with the overuse of specific online activities comprising communication, pornography, buying-shopping, gaming, and gambling via a device of choice [for empirical studies, see also Montag et al. (2015a), M\u00fcller et al. (2017)]. Importantly, neither generalized IUD, nor SmUD or most of the specific IUDs are currently included in official diagnostic manuals. Only gaming and gambling disorders (both predominantly online and offline) have been recognized as mental health disorders in the 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2021). Of importance for the present work, these two recently accepted disorders belong to the category of addictive behaviors in ICD-11, a currently discussed and intensely studied area that also touches the overuse of the smartphone (or some of its apps/contents). Although not an official diagnosis, SmUD tendencies are being investigated by many researchers around the world.\nTheoretical Conceptualization of the Emergence and Maintenance of Smartphone Use Disorder\nThe theoretical framework to conceptualize the current study is called the I-PACE (interaction of person-affect-cognition-execution) model by Brand et al. (2016). It was initially established to explain the emergence of specific IUDs, but is commonly used in research focusing on SmUD and its interplay with psychological and behavioral factors [e.g., see works by Elhai et al. (2020c), Elhai et al. (2019)].\nAccording to the I-PACE model, interactions (I) of a person's (P) core characteristics (e.g., personality traits, genetics, psychopathology, social cognition) and behavior-specific predisposing factors (e.g., needs, motives and values for going online) influence one's perception of external and internal (mood modification) triggers, and, in turn, the reaction in personal stressful or critical situations. Individual coping styles and reward expectancies may lead to affective (A) and cognitive (C) responses, such as salience that can induce a desire or strong need to use certain Internet activities (e.g., social media or online gaming apps). In other words, increased attention to stimuli as well as longing for a particular action may result in succumbing to the craving due to impairments in executive functioning (E), such as inhibitory control and decision making (Brand et al., 2016), to receive the desired gratification (Blumler, 1979; Sundar and Limperos, 2013). Based on the I-PACE model, stable personality traits (P) can be seen as predisposing variables contributing to both the emergence and the maintenance of SmUD. Similarly, and in line with this model, FoMO and mind-wandering (MW) might be seen as affective (A) and cognitive (C) variables mediating the relation between personality and SmUD (Brand et al., 2016, 2019).\nAnother important theory to be named in the context of our work explicitly targets the smartphone. Billieux's model (2012) specifically highlights the role of personality to better understand smartphone overuse and foresees neuroticism as a prominent risk factor. This assumption has been backed up in a recent meta-analysis showing robust links between higher neuroticism/lower conscientiousness and SmUD (Marengo et al., 2020).\nPersonality Predispositions of SmUD\nGiven the results from the aforementioned meta-analysis by Marengo et al. (2020), the associations of both higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness with higher levels of SmUD can be considered robust. However, it is less clear which cognitive and affective processes meditate the links between personal characteristics and SmUD. Therefore, the present work aims not only to replicate the above associations between personality traits and SmUD, but also to investigate the potential underlying mechanisms by including FoMO and MW as mediating variables. Both are of great interest, because they have been associated with other key variables of the present work: SmUD, neuroticism, and conscientiousness (see in the following sections \u201cFoMO as Mediating Variable in the Relations Between the Big Five and SmUD\u201d and \u201cMind-Wandering as a Mediator in the Big Five-SmUD Association\u201d for a more detailed elaboration).\nFoMO as Mediating Variable in the Relations Between the Big Five and SmUD\nFoMO describes the permanent concern that others (e.g., one's friends) have fulfilling experiences excluding oneself and the wish to stay connected with peers. The role of social media's design in triggering FoMO is at least theoretically well-established (Alutaybi et al., 2019; Montag et al., 2019), and research has shown that FoMO is robustly linked to SmUD (Chotpitayasunondh and Douglas, 2016; Elhai et al., 2016, 2018, 2020b,c,d; Fuster et al., 2017; Kuss and Griffiths, 2017; Oberst et al., 2017; Gezgin, 2018; Liu and Ma, 2018; Wolniewicz et al., 2018; Sha et al., 2019).\nMoreover, FoMO shows associations with personality variables. In particular, it is negatively linked to conscientiousness and positively to neuroticism (Stead and Bibby, 2017; Rozgonjuk et al., 2021). In parallel with the strong connection of FoMO and neuroticism, its association with negative affectivity (Elhai et al., 2018, 2020a) underscores that FoMO can be conceptualized as an affective and cognitive response in light of the I-PACE model. Against this background, FoMO is also understood as a specific cognition process (Balta et al., 2020) that represents a maladaptive cognitive coping strategy (Elhai et al., 2019) or a cognitive bias (Wegmann et al., 2017; Elhai et al., 2020c) mediating the relationship between individual's core characteristics, such as neuroticism, and SmUD (Balta et al., 2020). In addition to FoMO's negative associations with emotional stability (inverse of neuroticism) and conscientiousness, Stead and Bibby (2017) verified a profound positive link between FoMO and problematic internet use\u2014focusing on social media use. In the present study, FoMO is modeled as a mediator in the link between personality traits (neuroticism and conscientiousness) and SmUD.\nMind-Wandering as a Mediator in the Big Five-SmUD Association\nNext to FoMO, mind-wandering is of importance for the present study. It can broadly be defined as thought leaps not related to the currently executed task (Mrazek et al., 2013b). MW, thus, is closely related to inattention. This is also reflected in the items of the instrument used in the present study to measure levels of mind-wandering, the Mind-Wandering Questionnaire (MWQ) by Mrazek et al. (2013b). Despite the relatedness of mind-wandering and inattention, the naming of the applied questionnaire (MWQ), and for the sake of clarity, we decided to use the term \u201cmind-wandering\u201d throughout the whole study. With the MWQ, trait levels of the regular occurrence of mind-wandering can be investigated as done by Mrazek et al. (2013b).\nLinks between mind-wandering and personality traits, including low conscientiousness and high neuroticism, have been demonstrated using different instruments1 (Giambra, 1980; Carciofo et al., 2016). Further works, also applying various measures, underpin the link of mind-wandering with the Big Five (neuroticism and conscientiousness) (Jackson and Balota, 20122; Robison et al., 20173; Vannucci and Chiorri, 20184). In a related field of research, Nigg et al. (2002) discovered that higher attention problems (domain of the Wender-Stein ADHD Scales) were linked to lower conscientiousness and moderately correlated with higher neuroticism. The diversity of mind-wandering measures once again shows how intertwined the construct is with related scientific disciplines, especially the field of attention/inattention.\nVery little about the direct connections between mind-wandering itself and SmUD can be found in the literature. However, we identified a few studies pointing at a putative link between both aforementioned constructs: Mind-wandering on a daily basis (measured by four different instruments5) was positively associated with general smartphone use (sending and receiving texts, using social media, reading news, etc.) and above all with absent-minded smartphone use. The latter clearly dominates the connection with mind-wandering (Marty-Dugas et al., 2018). Furthermore, a significant relationship between inattentive behavior6 and SmUD has been discovered in the related research area mentioned above (Kim et al., 2020).\nFoMO and Mind-Wandering\nLittle research has investigated FoMO's link with mind-wandering. While the primary focus has been on examining the impact of smartphone notifications (Fitz et al., 2019)7, no study has assessed the direct association between FoMO and mind-wandering. FoMO has been linked to disrupted activities due to interruptive notifications (Rozgonjuk et al., 2019). Moreover, switching off notifications was found to trigger anxiety (Kushlev et al., 2016) and, people were afraid to miss out important messages on their mobile phones (Pielot and Rello, 2015). With regard to mind-wandering, Kushlev et al. (2016) found a positive association of push-notifications with inattention (which is conceptionally similar to mind-wandering; see section \u201cMind-Wandering as a Mediator in the Big Five-SmUD Association\u201d). However, no literature has been found that investigated the direct link between the two constructs.\nAims and Hypotheses of the Present Study\nIn this work, we want to shed more light on the hypothesized mechanisms underlying the associations between personality (P) and SmUD using a structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. Based on Billieux's relationship maintenance pathway and the I-PACE framework, we expect FoMO and mind-wandering\u2014representing affective (A) and cognitive (C) processes\u2014to mediate the relationship between personality, specifically neuroticism and conscientiousness, towards SmUD. Given the scarce literature on associations between FoMO and mind-wandering, we did not pose a hypothesis, and the investigation of this link was rather explorative.\nAlthough, the bivariate associations between personality, FoMO, mind-wandering, and SmUD have found substantial support in previous works. Research bringing all these variables together in a coherent model, to our knowledge, is non-existent. This makes the present study a novel contribution to the field of research on the underlying mechanisms of SmUD.\nOur model is visualized in Figure 1. Based on the body of literature cited above, we test the following hypotheses:\nH1: Higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness are associated with higher SmUD.\nH2: Higher neuroticism is associated with higher FoMO and higher mind-wandering levels.\nH3: Lower conscientiousness is associated with higher FoMO and higher mind-wandering levels.\nH4: The associations of neuroticism and conscientiousness with SmUD are mediated by FoMO and mind-wandering.\nFigure 1. Graphical representation of the theoretical research model. It shows the assembly of the latent constructs, depicted as circles (NR, CO, FoMO, MW, SmUD) and measured covariates (age, gender) displayed as rectangles (manifest variables). For reasons of clarity, items of latent variables are not presented here, however, they were used in calculating the model. Paths illustrated with one arrow tip signify a regression effect on the construct they point at, and two arrow tips indicate a covariance between two constructs. CO, Conscientiousness; NR, Neuroticism; MW, Mind-Wandering; FoMO, Fear of Missing Out; SmUD, Smartphone Use Disorder. We also note that the covariates age/gender have often been associated with several of the investigated variables (for reasons of brevity not discussed in this work) and, therefore, need to be controlled for.\nMaterials and Methods\nProcedure\nAnyone, who (i) was at least 12 years old, (ii) had Internet access, and (iii) understood the questions asked in German was allowed to participate. Prior to taking part in the study, all participants were informed about the procedures, and they gave their electronic consent for participation. If the participants were underaged (at least 12, but under 18 years old), parental or legal guardian electronic informed consent needed to be provided. Data of the convenience sample were collected from January to August 2020 from German-speaking smartphone users [on the Surveycoder platform, developed by Kannen (2018)]. The study was advertised on German television, in print media, and on the Internet. To attract people to take part, the participants received immediate feedback about their personality, smartphone and social media use after completing the survey. The entire online study was administered in German language. We collected data on basic sociodemographic variables, such as age, gender, country of residence, and the highest level of education in addition to the questionnaire data (as explained below). Because the current study was a part of a larger research project, other measures were also included in the survey. Therefore, the present sample also partially overlaps with samples of other publications (Sindermann et al., 2020, 2021a,b; Rozgonjuk et al., 2021).\nThe online study was approved by the local institutional ethics committee of Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.\nSample\nA total of 421 individuals took part in the study. However, n = 4 were excluded because they reported not owning a smartphone; hence, the questionnaire for measuring levels of SmUD was not presented to them. Two additional participants replied with the same response option across all items in all main questionnaires (described in the following section \u201cMeasures\u201d); finally, one participant had to be excluded because of not being eligible for the study (under 12 years old). Among the remaining participants, there were no missing data. The final sample comprised N = 414 (age range = 12\u201377, M = 33.64, SD = 13.49) participants. 151 (36.5%) were men and 263 (63.5%) were women. The vast majority of participants were from Germany (348; 84.1%), 53 participants (12.8%) were from Austria, and 13 individuals (3.1%) were from Switzerland. Almost half (192) of the participants (46.4%) held a higher educational degree, i.e., n = 147, over one-third (35.5%), had a University degree (Hochschulabschluss) and n = 45 (10.9%) a University of applied sciences degree (Fachhochschule). Approximately, one-quarter (24.4%), or n = 101 participants, had passed the A-levels (Abitur); n = 24 (5.8%) had a vocational diploma (Fachabitur). N = 73 (17.6%) participants had a secondary school leaving certificate (Mittlere Reife), n = 17 (4.1%) had a streamed secondary school degree (Volks-/Hauptschulabschluss), and n = 7 (1.7%) had not graduated.\nMeasures\nShort Version of the Smartphone Addiction Scale\nWe used the German translation [deutsche Kurzversion der Smartphonesuchtskala: d-KV-SSS as in Montag (2018)] of the short version of the Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS-SV) by Kwon et al. (2013). It reflects the degree of smartphone use disorder (SmUD) tendencies, including social and health impairment, and preoccupation. On this 10-item questionnaire, in which items are answered on a 6-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 6 = strongly agree), higher values in the range from 10 to 60 indicate a higher propensity towards SmUD. Example items comprise \u201cThe people around me tell me that I use my Smartphone too much,\u201d \u201cI have my Smartphone in my mind even when I am not using it,\u201d and \u201cI use my Smartphone longer than I had intended.\u201d Internal consistency represented by Cronbach's \u03b1 was 0.85 in the present sample.\nThe Big Five Inventory\nParticipants completed the German version of the Big Five Inventory (BFI; Rammstedt and Danner, 2017) consisting of 45 items answered on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = very inapplicable to 5 = very applicable). For the sake of completeness, we report internal consistencies and descriptive statistics of all Big Five variables, although, in our main analyses of the hypotheses, we only investigate the two personality traits, neuroticism (NR) and conscientiousness (CO). Cronbach's alphas for NR and CO were \u03b1(NR) = 0.85 and \u03b1(CO) = 0.85. For extraversion (EX), openness (OP), and agreeableness (AG), Cronbach's alphas were \u03b1(EX) = 0.88, \u03b1(OP) = 0.80, and \u03b1(AG) = 0.74.\nFear of Missing Out Scale\nWe assessed the degree of FoMO with the German version of the 10-item questionnaire of Przybylski et al. (2013) as provided in Spitzer (2015). This questionnaire uses a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not at all true of me to 5 = extremely true of me). Example items include \u201cI fear others have more rewarding experiences than me,\u201d \u201cI get anxious when I don't know what my friends are up to,\u201d and \u201cIt bothers me when I miss an opportunity to meet up with friends.\u201d Internal consistency assessed by Cronbach's \u03b1 was 0.75.\nMind-Wandering Questionnaire\nWe used the MWQ by Mrazek et al. (2013b) in this study. It measures trait levels of mind-wandering\u2014including aspects of inattention (specified by its items)\u2014representing a person's characteristics rather than a momentary state or snapshot of thought drifting, e.g., task-unrelated thoughts during a laboratory test. The five-item questionnaire (using a six-point response scale, 1 = almost never to 6 = almost always) includes the items \u201cI have difficulty maintaining focus on simple or repetitive work\u201d and \u201cI do things without paying full attention.\u201d The German version of the questionnaire was translated by the authors' research team by means of independent forward and backward translations, including subsequent discussions as well as adjustments if necessary (please find the German translation in the Supplementary Table 1). Cronbach's \u03b1 was 0.85.\nStatistical Analyses\nThe following analyses were conducted with SPSS (MAC-Version 26.0.0.0, IBM Corp, 2019): internal consistency analyses (Cronbach's alphas), descriptive statistics, and mean-value comparisons with t-tests (Welch's t-tests were applied whenever necessary) to examine gender differences, Pearson's zero-order correlations, and Pearson's partial correlation analyses for measuring associations between variables in the focus of the present study.\nMoreover, we conducted confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) to test the fit of the proposed factorial structure for each questionnaire using the cfa() function of the lavaan package (Rosseel, 2012). After controlling the model fit of each questionnaire, we computed a structural regression model (SRM) as depicted in Figure 1, including all items using the sem() function of the lavaan package. For both CFA and SRM, we used the diagonally weighted least square (DWLS)- and the weighted least squares mean and variance (WLSMV)-adjusted estimators as they deliver more accurate parameter estimates and a more robust model fit to the type of variables and non-normality compared to the maximum-likelihood (ML) methodology (M\u00eendril\u0103, 2010).\nIn the structural regression model depicted in Figure 1, we controlled for gender in the personality traits (NR and CO) and for age in all key variables (NR, CO, FoMO, MWQ, SAS-SV). FoMO and mind-wandering were specified to mediate the relationships between the two personality variables (NR and CO) and SmUD (the outcome variable). Moreover, both the personality traits (NR, CO) and the mediators (FoMO, MW) were each allowed to correlate with each other, to be exploratively estimated by SRM (i.e., a covariance estimate of zero would also be permissible). All constructs were modeled as latent variables.\nModel fit for each CFA and the SRM was evaluated with the standard indices considering their recommended thresholds for a good fit (Hu and Bentler, 1999; Hooper et al., 2008). For each construct, we report the following absolute fit indices: chi-square value including p-value and degrees of freedom (df), the root mean square error of approximation (good model fit assumed at RMSEA < 0.06) favoring models with fewer parameters, and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR < 0.08) suitable for constructs in one model that differ in the length of the Likert-scale ranges of the items. Incremental fit indices are also stated, such as the Tucker\u2013Lewis Index (TLI \u2265 0.95), preferring simpler models and being sensitive to small sample sizes, and the comparative fit index (CFI \u2265 0.95) well known for being less affected by sample size. The cfa() and sem() analyses were conducted using the statistical software R (R Core Team, 2020), version 4.0.2, with the graphical user interface RStudio (by RStudio Team, 2020), version 1.3.959.\nTo estimate an adequate sample size for SRM, we had a look at other studies that conducted similarly complex SEMs and executed several kinds of power analysis for SEM [e.g., semPOWER8 from Moshagen and Erdfelder (2016)]. With a hypothetical RMSEA value of 0.029 (indicating an excellent fit; Hooper et al., 2008), and the following parameters of a desired power of 0.99, an alpha of 0.01, df = 800 with 44 manifest variables, a sample size of N = 309 participants would be required. It has been suggested that using SEM, a sample size of at least N = 200 is recommended (Haenlein and Kaplan, 2004). In a similarly complex study with five latent variables, the sample analyzed contained approximately 400 participants (Balta et al., 2020); therefore, the sample size used in the current study is sufficient.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics and Gender Differences\nIn Table 1, we report descriptive statistics for all key variables. In addition to the total sample, we included the mean and standard deviations for both male and female subsamples. Supplementary Table 2 shows the mean-value comparisons of the variables (Age, SAS-SV, FoMO, MWQ, BFI-NR, BFI-CO) between men and women. Only for the Big Five variables, including NR [t(412) = \u22122.56, p = 0.011) and CO [t(412) = \u22123.13, p = 0.002], gender differences occurred on a significant level, which is why gender is included in the SRM to influence NR and CO.\nCorrelations Between Primary Variables\nTable 2 shows zero-order bivariate Pearson's correlation coefficients for key variables (BFI-NR, BFI-CO, FoMO, MWQ, SAS-SV) of this study as well as associations with age and partial Pearson's correlations controlling for age. The significance of all zero-order bivariate correlations between the key variables compared to partial Pearson's correlations remained robust, i.e., were roughly of similar size and similarly significant. SmUD (SAS-SV) showed the strongest association with MWQ: r = 0.611, p < 0.001, rp(controlled for age) = 0.577, p < 0.001. As can be seen in Table 2, BFI-NR, FoMO, MWQ, and SAS-SV were positively linked.\nTable 2. Zero-order bivariate Pearson's and partial Pearson's correlation coefficients representing associations between age and primary study variables among each other (N = 414).\nAge and BFI-CO correlated positively. Both are negatively associated with the remaining key variables: BFI-NR, FoMO, MWQ, and SAS-SV. Correlations computed by gender (presented in Supplementary Tables 3, 4) support these findings, except for the partial Pearson's correlation between BFI-CO and FoMO in the male subsample (rp = \u22120.086, p = 0.295), which is negative, but not significant. This suggests that the association of FoMO with BFI-CO in the whole sample (Table 2) is driven by the female subsample (rp = \u22120.280, p < 0.001). Based on these results, we included the covariate age for all latent key constructs (BFI-NR, BFI-CO, FoMO, MWQ, SAS-SV) in the SRM (Figure 1).\nConfirmatory Factor Analyses and Structural Regression Model\nFirst, we investigated the model fit of measurement models for each questionnaire with a series of CFAs. The results and the model fit improvement procedure of the FoMO construct are described in Supplementary Table 5.\nTable 3 shows the computed standardized path coefficients of the SRM (second last column), and partial Pearson's correlation coefficients (last column) for the total sample (N = 414). The effects of the two observed variables, age and gender, remained stable in the structural regression model compared with their corresponding bivariate correlations with all constructs of interest: NR, CO, FoMO, MWQ, and SmUD. Conscientiousness increases with age, whereas younger individuals have higher neuroticism. Both personality traits (neuroticism and conscientiousness) were predominantly found higher in women compared to men. Higher levels of FoMO, mind-wandering, and SmUD were more pronounced in younger people. The direct path coefficients computed in the structural regression model (Table 3) provided coherent results compared to bivariate correlation coefficients (Tables 2, 3). SmUD was positively linked to neuroticism (c1) and mind-wandering (b2). FoMO and mind-wandering were positively correlated with neuroticism (a1 and a2) and negatively linked to conscientiousness (a3 and a4). However, the direct effects of conscientiousness (c2) and FoMO (b1) on SmUD (gray shaded in Table 3 and displayed as dashed lines in Figure 2) were non-significant in the structural regression model. These links were completely mediated by mind-wandering: CO-MW-SmUD (a4\u00b7b2; illustrated as bold lines in Figure 2) and possibly also via the indirect path CO-FoMO-MW-SmUD, derived from the association between NR and CO. The direct effects of neuroticism (c1) and mind-wandering (b2) on SmUD were significant. This said, the effect size of c1-path (NR-SmUD) was reduced to one-third (pSmUD,NR = 0.107, p = 0.037) compared to the corresponding bivariate partial correlation coefficient (r = 0.350, p < 0.001). Thus, the direct association between neuroticism (c1) and SmUD is partially mediated by the indirect pathway, including mind-wandering: NR-MW-SmUD (a2\u00b7b2) illustrated as bold lines in Figure 2. Please note that the present work is of correlational nature; wording implies no causality.\nTable 3. Standardized path coefficients of the structural regression model compared to the bivariate correlation coefficients.\nFigure 2. Results of the structural regression model displaying the standardized path coefficients. The graphical representation of the model displays latent constructs as circles (NR, CO, FoMO, MW, SmUD) and measured covariates (age, gender) as rectangles (manifest variables). Paths illustrated with one arrow tip signify a regression on the construct they point at, and two arrow tips indicate a covariance between two constructs. For reasons of clarity, items of the latent variables are not presented here, but were used to calculate the model.

Dashed lines mark non-significant paths, and bold lines illustrate the dominating mediation pathways. Gray lines allow a better focus on the main associations investigated.\nDiscussion and Conclusions\nIn the present study, we investigated the indirect effects of FoMO and mind-wandering in the relations between SmUD and the personality traits, NR and CO.\nAs theoretical basis, we combined Billieux's pathways model (2012) and the I-PACE model of Brand et al. (2016, 2019) in the context of the taxonomy model from Montag et al. (2021). According to the I-PACE model, SmUD might be highly influenced by personal characteristics as well as other factors interacting with these variables. In the current work, personality traits (specifically, neuroticism and conscientiousness) can be understood as personal characteristics according to the I-PACE model, while mind-wandering and FoMO could be affective and cognitive variables. Our aim was to better understand relevant processes underlying the still novel phenomenon of SmUD. We investigated if neuroticism and conscientiousness predict SmUD, and whether mind-wandering and FoMO would mediate the link between personality and SmUD.\nImportantly, by using an SEM approach, we also addressed the limitations raised by Brand et al. (2016), namely, that isolated research of a few variables simplifies the nature of complex constructs, such as SmUD, to a large extent.\nFirst, we hypothesized that \u201cHigher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness are associated with higher SmUD\u201d (H1); \u201cHigher neuroticism is associated with higher FoMO and higher mind-wandering levels\u201d (H2); and \u201cLower conscientiousness is associated with higher FoMO and higher mind-wandering levels\u201d (H3). These hypotheses found support from the data in bivariate analyses. The results of Pearson's correlation analyses, both with and without controlling for age, showed that higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness were linked to higher levels of SmUD, consistent with previous findings (Marengo et al., 2020). In a multivariate structural regression model (results presented in Table 3), neuroticism was still positively linked to SmUD, but the direct CO-SmUD link was not significant; instead, it was fully mediated by mind-wandering.\nAll pathways of the SRM depicted in Figure 1 were significant in bivariate correlation analyses, aligning with findings in previous studies. Mind-wandering showed the strongest significant associations with all other key variables. Hence, it is not surprising that it was a significant factor in both mediation pathways (in line with hypothesis H4: \u201cThe associations of neuroticism and conscientiousness with SmUD are mediated by FoMO and mind-wandering\u201d). To our knowledge, this is the first study exploring a link between the two Big Five personality traits (neuroticism and conscientiousness) as well as mind-wandering and SmUD in a multivariate model. A person with high neuroticism, who is more worrisome, temperamental, and moody, may be more inclined to being inattentive. Moreover, self-disciplined, efficient, and conscientious individuals probably may be less prone to drift away with their thoughts as they are attributed to be focused (McCrae and John, 1992). These interrelations are reflected by our data in both bi- and multivariate analyses. The positive association between mind-wandering and SmUD was replicated compared to previous research (Zheng et al., 2014; Hadar et al., 2017; Marty-Dugas et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2020). Additionally, the links of higher FoMO between both higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness were also reproved (Stead and Bibby, 2017). Higher levels of FoMO, though, only denote a strong significant correlation with higher SmUD levels in the isolated bivariate analyses, which is in line with the literature (Chotpitayasunondh and Douglas, 2016; Elhai et al., 2016, 2018, 2020c; Oberst et al., 2017; Gezgin, 2018; Wolniewicz et al., 2018). However, the results of the SRM showed that this direct relationship (FoMO-SmUD) was not significant in the multivariate analysis (SRM). This finding suggests that the fourth hypothesis (H4) of the present study only finds partial support from the data, as mediation between personality traits and SmUD both times involves mind-wandering as a mainstay.\nThe results showed that mind-wandering may be a central factor in the personality\u2013SmUD association. This is in line with the I-PACE model, according to which mind-wandering might function as an affective and/or cognitive variable mediating the relation between personality traits and SmUD. Interestingly, FoMO's potential effects were low in the presence of mind-wandering. This might have its origin in the related nature of both constructs, reflected also in the significant covariance of FoMO and mind-wandering (Table 3). People with a scattered frequently drifting mind (mind-wandering) might be more familiar with the idea of what their peers are doing in the meantime (FoMO), and vice versa. However, both pairs\u2014neuroticism and FoMO, and mind-wandering and conscientiousness\u2014show stronger associations towards the other mediation candidate [Figure 2: NR-FoMO (stronger) vs. NR-MW (weaker) and CO-MW (stronger) vs. CO-FoMO (weaker)], respectively. This might account for the overlap of the concepts, FoMO and mind-wandering. For construct overlaps on item level, see page 5 of the Supplementary Material.\nThe Two-Fold Nature of Mind-Wandering Triggered by Smartphone Notifications\nNext to its stable tendency (trait), state levels of mind-wandering can also be measured by capturing momentary task-unrelated thoughts. As such, smartphone-induced prompts can stimulate a mind to wander, which might ultimately lead to an increased overall frequency of mind-wandering episodes. Especially, individuals with higher tendencies towards SmUD might be more vulnerable to such smartphone-induced stimuli. In this context, state mind-wandering describes interruptions by thoughts unrelated to the task on which one is currently focusing (Smallwood and Schooler, 2006). On the contrary, state mind-wandering might also influence smartphone use: When your mind wanders, you might to think more about your smartphone and, finally has a look at it, which may ultimately lead to SmUD. Therefore, inattentive behavior (state mind-wandering) and problematic smartphone use (Nixon, 2017) might be mutually dependent, described as follows.\nResearch from related fields shows that push notifications announced by acoustic and/or visual alerts on the smartphone lead to numerous daily interruptions resulting in performance drain (Stothart et al., 2015). Even the sole presence of a smartphone interferes negatively with cognitive capacity (Ward et al., 2017). A study with a 2-week longitudinal design (self-reports accompanied by experiments) underpins that interruptions caused by smartphone notifications increase state mind-wandering in form of inattention9 (Kushlev et al., 2016). Owning a mobile phone or the duration of consuming entertainment on a mobile phone has been discovered to be significantly linked to inattention in a sample of Chinese adolescents (Zheng et al., 2014). Moreover, in a Hebrew population, heavy smartphone use, in particular, the frequency of smartphone usage, predicted the degree of impaired attention (Hadar et al., 2017).\nThese studies indicate that mind-wandering might also be triggered by the use or the sole presence of the smartphone in form of frequent disturbances, which reduce attention, thus hindering the performance of ongoing tasks. Experiments in these settings indicate that people compensate those externally induced interruptions and, contrary to expectations, complete the task they are focused on even quicker and with the same quality (Zijlstra et al., 1999; Mark et al., 2008). However, the downside of this is disrupted emotion regulation, which may lead to decreased well-being (for instance, higher levels of stress, feelings of frustration and exhaustion). The evolving unpleasant feelings from the latter in turn create an urge for instant gratification and/or compensation, allowing maladaptive coping mechanisms to kick in. These may result in further active smartphone use, forming a vicious circle (Kushlev et al., 2016) between a \u201cwandering mind\u201d and smartphone-induced interruptions (Figure 3: b2). Wilmer et al. (2017) gave an overview about the connection between habitual smartphone use and cognition focusing on effects on memory, gratification, and attention in their review. Related to this, Liebherr et al. (2020) build a first hypothetical model about immediate- and long-term effects of smartphone use on the triad of attention, working memory, and inhibition. Due to the close direct connection of mind-wandering and SmUD, the assumption is obvious that individuals with an innately wandering mind (trait) may be even more prone to become trapped in the mutually reinforcing interrelationship of mind-wandering and SmUD.\nFigure 3. Illustration of the significant associations between the key variables calculated by SRM including the interrelation (b2) between MW and SmUD, reinforcing each other; CO, Conscientiousness; NR, Neuroticism; MW, Mind-Wandering; FoMO, Fear of Missing Out; SmUD, Smartphone Use Disorder.\nThis said, a wandering mind can also be seen in a positive light. For instance, the right dose of mind-wandering might foster creativity (Baird et al., 2012); however, it should be noted that the kind of mind-wandering in Baird et al. (2012) was not assessed in the present study. Rather, the focus was on the dark side of mind-wandering, such as drifting thoughts or inattention (again, more in the sense of a trait).\nInterventions Targeting Dysfunctional Mind-Wandering\nThe central role of mind-wandering between the predominant personality factors and SmUD is more clearly illustrated in Figure 3. The results of the present study suggest that mind-wandering might be a promising target to reduce SmUD and break the \u201cvicious cycle\u201d described in the section \u201cThe Two-Fold Nature of Mind-Wandering Triggered by Smartphone Notifications\u201d. Mindfulness training has been identified to lower the occurrence of mind-wandering: A two-week course (Mrazek et al., 2013a) or eight minutes of mindful breathing (Mrazek et al., 2012) showed effect in reducing mind-wandering-related behaviors. Another helping intervention to decrease levels of mind-wandering and gain back concentration to work in flow is to batch smartphone notifications (Fitz et al., 2019).\nFollowing the quote \u201cConcentration of consciousness, and concentration of movements, diffusion of ideas and diffusion of movements go together.\u201d from Ribot (1890, p. 24), Carriere et al. (2013) investigated mind-wandering and fidgeting as this specific form of body movement that turned out to be linked to attention. In individuals whose minds spontaneously wander, a hand or other parts of the body tend to wander or move as well. An example of a tool that was designed especially for people who frequently fidget is the \u201cfidget cube\u201d10. Further investigation of intervention effects on mind-wandering could encompass to what extent the aforementioned game device or similar tools improve the attention capacity. The two mutually reinforcing variables and the therapeutic effect of reducing mind-wandering on SmUD should be explored in depth in future studies. This could increase productivity and mental well-being of people who are prone to mind-wandering, i.e. who are also easily distracted by digital devices.\nLimitations\nThe following shortcomings of the present study are to be mentioned. First, the focus on the smartphone device itself in many works (including this one) may need a refocus, because users attach to applications running on the smartphone but not necessarily to the smartphone itself (Pontes et al., 2015). Several recent empirical works showed a moderate to strong overlap between the overuse of smartphones and social media applications, which might induce social network-use disorders (SNUDs). Among others, excessive smartphone and WhatsApp use overlap very strongly [Sha et al., 2019; for shared variance with other platforms, see also Rozgonjuk et al. (2020)].\nSecond, the data were cross-sectional and although the structural regression model included directed pathways, the causal links stem from theory (assuming that personality is relatively stable over time and affects behavior) rather than an experimental study. Therefore, the causality should be interpreted with care.\nThird, our study did not include objectively measured smartphone use. Although SmUD cannot be equated with the frequency and duration of smartphone use as posited in the I-PACE model (Brand et al., 2019), the inclusion of objectively measured data on smartphone use could provide further insight into the relationships between psychological variables and smartphone use. Recently, a novel field of research, Psychoinformatics, has emerged that could contribute additional insights to self-administered questionnaires, including how and when the device is used for what (Montag et al., 2014, 2015b). Furthermore, it is still under investigation whether FoMO (Wegmann et al., 2017; Balta et al., 2020) and mind-wandering are state or trait variables; however, states and traits are connected (please note that in Wegmann et al., 2017, trait- and state-FoMO are operationalized differently, i.e., state-FoMO stands for online FoMO). At least for the mind-wandering construct, trait/state-effects seem to validate each other (Seli et al., 2016). However, deliberate and spontaneous mind-wandering might need to be disentangled (Carriere et al., 2013; Seli et al., 2015, 2016; Vannucci and Chiorri, 2018). Moreover, even different forms of smartphone use (general and absent-minded11) have been considered by Marty-Dugas et al. (2018) in this context.\nPlease note that mind-wandering was assessed in the sense of a disposition towards inattentive states in the present study. Therefore, a wandering mind being even associated with creativity (e.g., Baird et al., 2012; Leszczynski et al., 2017) has not been covered in this work (but this might be an interesting lead for future studies in the context of smartphone use). Finally, due to the nature of our sample, as described in the section \u201cSample\u201d, our results may only be partially generalizable to other populations.\nConclusion\nIn sum, this is the first study that investigated the effects of personality, FoMO, and mind-wandering on SmUD. Most interestingly, mind-wandering, a variable barely examined in the context of SmUD so far, turned out to be an interesting new construct to explain SmUD. Based on that, new treatment opportunities for SmUD can arise. Future research should investigate the associations between mind-wandering and SmUD more in depth by implementing an experimental study design supported by psychoinformatic methodologies to examine causal relations. Overall, the findings from our study provide a starting point to work on interventions related to mind-wandering, such as mindfulness trainings, to reduce or even treat SmUD. This can significantly improve well-being and quality of life for many people.\nData Availability Statement\nThe data will be made available upon scholarly request via the first author.\nEthics Statement\nThe online study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of Ulm University, Helmholtzstra\u00dfe 20 (Oberer Eselsberg), 89081 Ulm, Germany, https://www.uni-ulm.de/en/einrichtungen/ethikkommission-der-universitaet-ulm/.\nAuthor Contributions\nMM and CM planned the present study.

      "text": "Could wearable devices adversely affect health?\n- Date:\n- July 24, 2024\n- Source:\n- University of North Carolina Health Care\n- Summary:\n- For patients with Afib, using a wearable device can lead to higher rates of anxiety about their Afib symptoms and treatment, doctor visits, and use of informal healthcare resources, according to a new study.\n- Share:\nUsing a wearable device, such as a smart watch, to track health data and symptoms, is supposed to help people monitor their health and address symptoms as quickly as possible to spur positive health outcomes. But for people with atrial fibrillation, also known as Afib, using a wearable device to monitor the heart rate and to alert wearers of an irregular heartbeat might not be as helpful as wearers think.\nA new study in the Journal of the American Heart Association, led by Lindsay Rosman, PhD,assistant professor of medicine in the division of cardiology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, is the first to show that wearable devices, such as smart watches, can significantly amplify anxiety and increase healthcare use in patients with Afib.\nThe study included 172 patients from UNC Health with a prior diagnosis of Afib who completed a survey and had their information linked to electronic health records. About half of the study sample had a wearable device and their data was compared to individuals without a wearable device. Rosman and her team found that patients with Afib who use wearables are more likely to be preoccupied with their heart symptoms, report concerns about their AFib treatment, and use healthcare resources compared to Afib patients without these devices. Providers and healthcare clinics were also impacted, as wearable users were more likely to call the clinic and send messages to their healthcare providers than individuals who did not have a device.\nAlso, 1 in 5 AFib patients who used wearables in this study experienced intense fear and anxiety in response to irregular rhythm notifications from their device. And a similar proportion (20%) routinely contacted their doctors when ECG results were abnormal or indicative of possible AFib. But it's unclear if they actually needed to see a doctor, due to the alerts from their devices. It's also unclear if the reported anxiety contributed to the worsening of symptoms, although anxiety has been a well-documented contributing factor to various conditions, including AFib.\n\"Given the significant increase in use of wearable devices in this patient group (and the population in general),\" said Rosman, \"we believe prospective studies and randomized trials are needed to understand the net effects of wearables -- including their alerts -- on patients' healthcare use and psychological well-being, as well as the downstream effects on providers, hospitals, and health systems.\"\nStory Source:\nMaterials provided by University of North Carolina Health Care.

  "argos_summary": "A statistical analysis by Market.us Scoop reveals that 32% of U.S. adults use wearable devices, with higher usage among younger demographics, particularly Gen-Z and women. While these devices help track fitness and health metrics, studies indicate that they can also lead to increased anxiety, particularly among patients with atrial fibrillation, who may become overly preoccupied with health data. Experts emphasize the need for further research on the mental health impacts of wearables, as well as the importance of managing notifications and settings to mitigate potential anxiety.",
