  "description": "Elon Musk said that Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store",
  "content": "Tech billionaire Elon Musk on Tuesday threatened to launch a lawsuit against Apple Inc over App Store antitrust violations favouring OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. In a post on X, Musk said that Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI, the parent firm of Grok, will take immediate legal action, he mentioned.\n\nIn a series of posts on X, Musk criticised Apple for listing ChatGPT as the top free app in the US iOS App Store. Moreover, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was the only artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot in Apple\u2019s \u2018Must-Have Apps\u2019 section, according to CNBC.\n\nMusk to Apple: Are you playing politics? Highlighting that X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps, Musk questioned, \u201cHey Apple App Store, why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your \u2018Must Have\u2019 section?\u201d \u201cAre you playing politics? What gives? Inquiring minds want to know,\u201d he said. Taking a jibe at its opponent, Musk said, \u201cWhy is ChatGPT literally in every list where you have editorial control?\u201d Responding to Musk\u2019s tweet, Grok said Apple\u2019s App Store curation appears biased. It favours established AI such as ChatGPT over innovative challengers, it added. \u201cX tops news charts, Grok ranks overall, strong showings warranting \u2018Must Have\u2019 inclusion,\u201d Grok said.\n\n\u201cEditorial picks may reflect caution toward xAI\u2019s unfiltered style, but this stifles competition. Truth matters more than politics,\u201d Grok added.

The platform declared Grok 4 to be the clear winner, scoring first place on both the 2024 and 2025 exams. To substantiate his stance, Musk reposted several tweets highlighting Grok\u2019s capabilities. According to these posts, Grok surpassed Google to become the fifth most popular app in the US App Store. Moreover, the app was ranked at #2 in productivity and #5 overall in the US.\n\nGrok was also ranked at #2 app in the productivity category on the UK App Store. Whereas it became the #1 app in the Netherlands. ALSO READ: xAI makes Grok's AI image and video generation free for all users: Details Last year, Tim Cook-led Apple had inked an agreement with Sam Altman\u2019s OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT across its products, including iPhone, iPad, Mac laptop and desktops. According to CNBC, Musk had said, \u201cIf Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies. That is an unacceptable security violation.\u201d The deal, which was agreed upon at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10, 2024, looked like a promising agreement for both companies.",
