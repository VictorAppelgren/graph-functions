      "summary": "Former CIA director and retired Army general David Petraeus warned that President Putin has no intention of ending the war in Ukraine unless he is granted additional territory, calling for stronger U.S. aid, sanctions and the release of frozen Russian reserves. He also criticized the Pentagon’s restrictions on long‑range weapons and urged a review of U.S. policy toward Ukraine. In other news, the Supreme Court is being asked to overturn the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges same‑sex marriage ruling, while Hurricane Erin remains a Category 1 storm threatening coastal flooding and high surf along the East Coast. A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to withhold HUD grant money from sanctuary cities for lack of cooperation with immigration enforcement. ",
