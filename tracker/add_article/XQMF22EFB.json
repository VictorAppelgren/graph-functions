      "summary": "The article discusses the U.S. Commerce Department’s plan to publish GDP data on nine public blockchains starting July 2025, highlighting the government’s focus on verifiability over speed. It examines the broader trend of blockchain adoption in business, noting that while public chains offer tamper‑proof records, their cost and latency make them suitable mainly for multi‑party trust scenarios rather than everyday enterprise databases. The piece also covers recent tokenization initiatives by JP Morgan, Kraken, and Robinhood, the regulatory uncertainty surrounding tokenized securities, and the challenges of stablecoin fragmentation for corporate treasury. Finally, it touches on Google Cloud’s Universal Ledger and GoodWares’ AI‑powered blockchain platform as examples of industry efforts to integrate blockchain and AI into financial and supply‑chain operations.",
