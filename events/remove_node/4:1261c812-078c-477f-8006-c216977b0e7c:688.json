    "reason": "A local mayoral race in New York City is unlikely to have a direct, actionable impact on macro‑financial markets or provide a clear trading signal. It does not influence global or national policy, currency, commodity, or asset pricing, and thus does not meet the criteria for any of the importance levels. Therefore it should be removed from the macro‑market analysis.",
