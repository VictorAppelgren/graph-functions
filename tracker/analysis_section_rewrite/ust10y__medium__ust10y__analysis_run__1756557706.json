      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits (compact paragraph)**  \nYour draft is on the right track but needs tighter alignment with the *Section Focus* (USD‑DXY, 3‑6‑month horizon) and Argos’ stringent formatting rules. 1) **Map every claim to a canonical handle** – explicitly state “DXY” or “ust10y” with a sign and magnitude (e.g., “DXY down 2 % in August (≈ –200 bp)”). 2) **Add a clear causal chain** – start with the political narrative (Trump‑Fed interference → loss of Fed independence → market‑perceived dovishness → short‑term yield easing → DXY weakness). 3) **Include precise catalyst windows** – e.g., “Fed rate‑cut odds rise as the September 5 payrolls report is released (week 1‑2 of September)”; “Cook lawsuit verdict expected 2025‑10‑15”. 4) **Quantify risks and alternatives** – “Fed hike in September would lift DXY by +150‑250 bp; political stabilization could reverse the 2 % monthly decline to +0.5 %”. 5) **Add watch‑list signals** – “Fed minutes (Sept 5), PCE (Sept 15), Cook lawsuit outcome (Oct 15)”. 6) **Remove generic platitudes** – e.g., “persistent inflation keeps the Fed’s mandate in the back of the market’s mind” → replace with “July core PCE at 2.9 % (≈ +0.3 % YoY) signals continued inflationary pressure, supporting rate‑cut expectations”. 7) **Cite IDs inline** – e.g., “(Z7O1DCHS7)”, “(FAN5RYW6T)”. 8) **End with a concise confidence rating** – “Confidence: moderate‑high (based on converging political, yield‑curve, and inflation evidence)”. 9) **Avoid any mention of unrelated assets** (e.g., equities, commodities) unless they directly transmit to DXY. 10) **Ensure every paragraph starts with a clear, actionable statement** (e.g., “DXY is projected to fall 2 % in August, driven by …”). Implement these edits to meet the 1–2‑alt, risk, watch‑list, and confidence structure Argos requires.",
