  "title": "Can A DeWalt Battery Be Reset?",
  "description": "There are ways to jump a dead DeWalt battery, or to reset the circuitry inside, but it's safer to buy a new one or get your old one replaced under warranty.",
  "content": "No matter the brand, tool batteries will eventually deteriorate. They may fail to hold a charge, giving you less use time, or even not charge at all, making them essentially a lost cause \u2014 just two of the biggest problems and disadvantages of lithium-based batteries. Fortunately, if you're working with a brand as large as DeWalt, finding a retailer that sells new batteries is about as easy as discerning real DeWalt batteries from knock-offs. However, before buying a new battery, one might wonder if there's something they can do to revive their current faulty one. One solution that may seem like a good idea is to reset it. There are a few ways to do this, as evidenced by the many tutorials online. For example, YouTuber Matthew Peech reset a bad battery by connecting its positive and negative terminals to those on a functioning one. After a few seconds of doing so, the dying battery had just enough energy to start charging again. Meanwhile, Home Battery Bank presented the idea of opening up a bad DeWalt battery to test the individual cells inside, explaining that bad ones can either be reset or replaced. Overall, these appear to be smart solutions for stubborn, dying DeWalt batteries. In truth, though, resetting a DeWalt unit isn't a great idea for multiple reasons.\n\nResetting DeWalt batteries can be risky. The energy transfer method, where you connect a good battery to a bad one, can be painful if you're not careful. Dealing with electricity and partially exposed wiring can lead to electrical shock or even damage to the batteries themselves if the wires aren't attached correctly. Also, there's a risk of overheating the batteries if you leave them connected for too long. Opening a DeWalt battery is even more dangerous. Lithium-ion batteries are full of flammable and otherwise volatile materials that could cause serious harm. Mishandling can allow oxygen and moisture to oxidize the lithium within, possibly causing the cells to catch fire or explode due to thermal runaway. On top of all this, there are other repercussions to resetting a DeWalt battery yourself. It's almost certainly going to void the 3-year limited warranty attached to it. DeWalt's warranty terms explicitly state that the company only covers damages that don't result from regular wear and tear or some form of abuse. It goes without saying that jumping a dying battery with a fresher one or opening the battery's casing to mess with the internal components could both be considered abuse. So, while it's possible, resetting a DeWalt battery isn't recommended. Instead, there are safer ways to get a fully functioning battery for your DeWalt tools.\n\nIf you think your DeWalt battery needs a reset to get it working again, you should know by now that it isn't really worth it. Instead, you can go a few different routes. The most obvious is to dispose of the old battery properly \u2014 not by tossing it in the trash, mind you, but taking it somewhere that specializes in lithium-ion battery recycling \u2013 and purchase a new one. Unfortunately, DeWalt batteries aren't cheap, but if you need one that badly, it's better than paying for fire-related damages, or worse, hospital bills from a botched repair. If you're lucky enough, though, you might not have to buy a new battery at all. As mentioned, DeWalt's batteries come with a three-year warranty that may allow you to get a new or repaired battery at no cost. Of course, the malfunction has to fall within the warranty's terms; if DeWalt judges that you've abused it or if it's failed due to regular wear and tear, you're out of luck. At the very least, you can get in contact with the folks at DeWalt over the phone or via its support website to explore your options. As viable an option as resetting a DeWalt battery may seem, the risks behind it very much outweigh the reward. Exploring safer alternatives to get your tools powered up is undoubtedly the way to go.",

      "text": "The Biggest Problems And Disadvantages Of Lithium Batteries\nWhen the battery was first invented in the 1800s, its energy storage capabilities unlocked innovation in unimaginable ways. From discs of copper and zinc held together by old-school electrolytes, the battery has evolved to the point wherein it's an essential part of everyday life. Since its inception, several types of batteries have been released into the market, such as alkaline, nickel metal hydride (NiMH), and lithium.\nAmong these, the most commonly used type of battery found in our homes, offices, schools, and everything in between is the lithium-ion battery. According to the Clean Energy Institute, lithium-ion batteries are the top choices for portable devices, due to their high energy density and relatively long lifespans. They are also believed to hold the highest potential for electric transportation methods, such as electric vehicles and electric airplanes. Apple, which uses lithium-ion batteries in most of its devices, notes that they tend to charge faster, last longer, and have higher power density than traditional batteries.\nHowever, lithium-ion batteries are not without their fair share of problems and disadvantages. Here are some of them.\nDegradation\nIn an Air Quality News article, Faraday Institution Ph.D. researcher Beatrice Browning shares that battery lifetime can be reduced when its electrode structure is damaged, which occurs when lithium-ion cycles in and out of the electrodes. In a study by the Royal Society of Chemistry, three main external stress factors influenced degradation: temperature, state of charge (SoC), and load profile. With a limited number of lifecycles, lithium-ion batteries naturally lose capacity with time. Although Battery University claims that counting cycles are inconclusive because a discharge may vary in depth, and there is no specific standard for what constitutes a cycle.\nIn addition, some uses for lithium-ion batteries, such as EVs, have external factors, such as charging rates, weather conditions, and charging practices, that affect their overall lifespan. Newark Electronics confirms that it's even possible for lithium-ion batteries to age, even without any use, due to continuous discharge. Lithium batteries can also degrade to issues beyond your control, such as due to manufacturing defects, which could lead to deadly consequences.\nBattery swelling\nTypically, battery swelling is a symptom of a variety of problems. For example, this could be due to something as simple as usage, such as overcharging or using the wrong voltage. Or, the bloating could be due to something beyond your control, such as manufacturing defects like damaged membranes. Aside from the obvious cosmetic issues this brings, such as bulging cases, it can also be potentially dangerous.\nNew Jersey residents filed a class-action suit against Apple in 2019 due to a battery swelling problem with the Apple Watch. Considered a safety hazard, the plaintiffs claimed that the battery swelling problem was said to physically pop off or break the Apple Watch screen.\nIn 2021, another class action lawsuit filed in California claimed every model produced lacked any \"thermal or other solution to prevent and/or mitigate the danger of a detached, shattered, or cracked Watch screen resulting from the insufficient space allocated within the device for the rectangular shaped, electromagnetically charged lithium cobalt oxide battery.\"\nAlthough Court House News shares that parts of this case were dismissed, it doesn't negate the risk of personal injury that was confirmed. Aside from Apple, many other electronics companies which use lithium-ion batteries suffer from the same issue.\nFire hazards\nBecause of their energy efficiency and lightweight nature, lithium-ion batteries are the top choice for many of today's electric vehicle manufacturers. Although they're relatively less prone to overheating, lithium-ion batteries can still catch fire, most commonly due to thermal runaway or uncontrollable heating. In fact, over 240 lithium-ion battery fires broke out across 64 municipal waste facilities from 2013 to 2020 in the United States (via the Environmental Protection Agency).\nIn 2016, Samsung permanently discontinued its Galaxy Note 7 line due to a design flaw that caused units to not just overheat but quite literally explode. This came after several users reported their Galaxy Note 7 devices exploding, including the replacement models. A few months after production was stopped, CNBC shared that Samsung pointed to issues with welding defects and short-circuiting lithium-ion batteries. Since then, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recall has covered 1.9 million Galaxy Note 7 phones in the United States.\nPoor battery disposal practices\nAlthough we've already established that all lithium-ion batteries will, at some point, be unusable, it's important to understand that there are still limited methods for disposing of them.\nWhile some people get away with throwing AA batteries in the trash, the EPA recommends that lithium-ion batteries should never be included in household garbage or ordinary recycling bins. Because lithium-ion batteries are prone to fire, they can cause trouble from the transport process, such as in the trucks, to the actual landfill.\nTherefore, it's vital to bring your unusable lithium-ion batteries to the appropriate waste collection and recycling facilities. In addition, the EPA also recommends taping terminals and keeping them in plastic bags. However, it cautions that it's best to check specific battery manufacturers for the appropriate disposal practices.\nAlthough there has been a newly discovered method for recycling lithium, the reality is the proper disposal of household battery items takes a lot of effort. Not everyone has the time and energy to go to certified electronics recyclers.\nExpensive to manufacture\nAccording to EPEC, lithium batteries clock in as the most expensive out of all the types of battery chemistries, with prices for lithium batteries ranging around $132 per kWh in 2021. However, because they're more efficient, the cost is often justified by how long they are used.\nWhile lithium-ion batteries are still the top choice for many types of electronics, our changing needs as a society require more efficient battery components in the future. Not to mention, there's hope that it becomes more affordable due to falling lithium prices.\nIn addition, we're developing new types of battery technology, like aluminum-ion batteries, that can charge significantly faster than lithium-based batteries. That said, they typically don't have the same density as lithium-ion batteries. With fast charging being a critical issue for electric vehicle owners, this could potentially lessen the barriers to EV transition, even if it means less range per charge."

      "text": "How To Tell If Your DeWalt Batteries Are Real Or Knock-Offs\nWhen it comes to cordless power tools, batteries are the core technology that make them possible. Previously, we've talked before about how you can actually use DeWalt batteries with non-DeWalt tools, like Cerycose Cordless Oscillating Tool, RexLeLXB Cordless Hot Glue Gun, and Livowalny Tire Inflator and Compressor. Although, this isn't really ideal, since most power tool manufacturers only recommend using their products with those in their ecosystem. Otherwise, you might risk some compatibility issues in the future, especially if the internal components are damaged. However, one of the reasons why your power tool batteries might not be acting right could also be that they're actually fake products. And unfortunately, counterfeit batteries carry risks, like catching fire, exploding, or just simply not powering things the way that they should.\nIf you suspect that yours might not be real, there are some typical signs that you should watch out for, such as fitting poorly into your DeWalt power tools. After all, they should lock in perfectly like puzzle pieces, since they were optimized to work together. Alternatively, you can also test whether the battery life matches what is expected with the specific tool. But take note, even authentic batteries do tend to degrade with time. So, if you're buying secondhand this might not be the best indicator. But if you don't even want to plug a possible fake battery into your DeWalt power tool, here are some ways to check for yourself based on just how it looks.\nHow to check your DeWalt batteries are real based on appearance\nIn general, companies like DeWalt invest heavily in maintaining their reputation, so their products have gone through quality testing, leading to a consistent appearance. Because of this, how a battery looks can be a good clue of whether or not it's authentic. Should you be replacing a similar battery that you previously owned, you can also use it to compare authenticity. Among the things that you should watch out for includes the shade of color of the battery, as well as the fonts and stickers. But take note, it's possible that second-hand batteries will have colors that fade after some time. DeWalt also notes that how the screws look is a probable indicator, specifically in its color (it's supposed to be silver) and dome-shaped top. Lastly, it's highly unlikely that DeWalt would let something as simple as a spelling error get mass produced in its official factories.\nThat said, it's important to note that it's entirely possible that a battery can look real from the outside, but its internal components are not. In this case, you'll have to look at other factors, such as the serial code. For the average person, it's likely you're not well-versed in the naming codes of power tool brands like DeWalt. But, if you're not sure if the DeWalt code on your battery or charger is legit, the power tool manufacturer asks customers to contact support.\nHow to prevent yourself from buying fake DeWalt batteries\nWhile being able to tell whether your batteries are fake or not is a good skill to have, it's best to avoid having to check entirely and just playing it safe from the get-go. Apart from not buying second-hand from unknown sellers, you should buy from only authorized retailers or trusted sources in the future. If possible, don't forget to ask for official receipts, which can be useful when trying to prove your DeWalt battery warranty coverage. The company's batteries are usually covered under its three-year warranty policy, but other factors affect this, such as if you're the original owner and if it's from an authorized seller. Plus, it also matters if there are signs that the battery has been abused or used incorrectly. Either way, you should also take a photo of the guaranteed original packaging. You can use it as a point of reference for future purchases.\nBut, if you do find yourself with fake power tool batteries, it's important to take the necessary precautions to get rid of them safely. Apart from taking them out of your tools, you should also send them to the right electronics processing facilities, so they do not become a hazard to other people, whether it's the trash collectors or unsuspecting buyers at garage sales. It's important to report the incident for further investigation, such as to your credit card company, the online retailer, and official government websites, like STOPfakes.gov and IPRCenter.gov."

      "text": "Recycling Lithium-Ion Batteries Explained: The 2 Methods\nRecycling electronics is a delicate process in terms of the actual procedure and how difficult it can be for the average consumer to find a facility to dispose of the items properly. The lithium-ion batteries that power many of today's electronic devices just complicate the matter, as their energy density and flammable insides make them volatile enough that federal regulations govern how they can be transported. When it comes to recycling the elements of the batteries, scientists have arrived at two different techniques: Pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy, which must be performed to extract everything even if the batteries have already gone through a mechanical recycling process.\nAs the name suggests, pyrometallurgy uses heat to extract materials from a battery, generally using an electric arc or a shaft furnace. One benefit is that it can recycle batteries of various chemistries, like nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal hydride, not just lithium-ion. It's not perfect, though. \"[T]he process has high-capital requirements and is also energy intensive while requiring off-gas cleaning,\" IDTechEx technology analyst Conrad Nichols told Assembly Magazine. \"Pyrometallurgy produces a mixed metal alloy, as well as a slag stream, containing lithium, manganese, and aluminum. Therefore, this would still require further hydrometallurgical processing if all valuable metals were to be re-obtained at battery grade.\"\nHydrometallurgical recycling has benefits that go hand-in-hand with pyrometallurgical\nHydrometallurgical recycling, meanwhile, uses water-based solvents to recycle \"black mass\" \u2014 the industry term for ground-up batteries \u2014 or to refine the metals extracted from batteries using pyrometallurgy. \"The key benefits of hydrometallurgical recycling are that more of the valuable metals can be recovered, and it is less energy intensive than pyrometallurgical recycling,\" IDTechEx's Nichols continued. \"The costs of reagents and high volumes of water consumption also pose some downsides. However, some recyclers [claim] that they are able to cycle water multiple times through the recycling process to maximize its efficiency.\"\nNichols added that while most of the hydrometallurgical recycling facilities are located in the Asia-Pacific region, some Western facilities understand how both recycling methods benefit the other and are adding hydrometallurgical capacity to their existing pyrometallurgical facilities. Hopefully, we'll see a future where additional energy doesn't have to be expended to ship battery materials halfway around the world to allow them to be fully recycled."
