  "content": "Apple Cinemas is being sued by Apple. Image source: Apple\n\nA statement filed by Apple Cinemas in response to Apple's trademark lawsuit points to its naming origins as a justification for the chain's compliance with trademark laws.\n\nThe Apple name has had its host of lawsuits over the decades. Whether it was Apple losing a case losing a case over the Apple Music name, or making peace after thirty years of legal battles with The Beatles Apple Corps, it's a brand Apple fights fiercely to protect.\n\nApple filed a lawsuit against the expanding Apple Cinemas on August 2, and the theater chain has filed its official response. According to the press release, Apple Cinemas is going to defend its brand and its right to operate as Apple Cinemas.\n\n\"For over a decade, Apple Cinemas has proudly delivered a best-in-class moviegoing experience to audiences across our growing network of theaters. Our name reflects our roots, beginning with our first planned location at the Apple Valley Mall in New England\u2014 a project that inspired the launch of the Apple Cinemas brand and set the foundation for our expansion... ...We are committed to defending our brand, our history, and our continued right to operate as Apple Cinemas\u2014 an identity that is and has always been clearly distinct and fully compliant with all applicable trademark laws. Apple Cinemas is a long-established independent theater chain with no connection to Apple Inc. Our name reflects our geographic roots and has never been intended to suggest, or used to imply, any affiliation with their brand.\"\n\nThis is just the first response in what will likely be a long legal battle. Apple claims that Apple Cinemas can cause customer confusion thanks to its name, its promotion of using modern technology, and its expansion into markets that are close to Apple Stores.\n\nApple Cinemas asserts that it is committed to providing exceptional in-person entertainment experiences. Its partnership with IMAX and ScreenX makes it a great place to see Apple's F1 movie, which may be part of Apple's issue here.\n\nToo bad the theater industry isn't what it used to be, as it would have benefited Apple at one point to own the distribution vertical for its Apple TV+ films. While this lawsuit will likely not end in an acquisition, it will be a test of how Apple views its push into film as part of its brand.",

      "text": "An independent musician has beaten Apple over the company's attempts to trademark the term \"Apple Music,\" which he claimed would lead to confusion with his own \"Apple Jazz\" term.\nMusician Charlie Bertini opposed Apple's application for a federal trademark for \"Apple Music\" when that streaming service was launched. In 2021, the US Trademark Office ruled in favor of Apple, specifically because Apple claimed that it had a prior claim.\nThat claim was to do with how Apple acquired sound recordings, and a 1968 \"Apple\" trademark, when it acquired The Beatles' firm Apple Corps in 2007. Bertini had been using his \"Apple Jazz\" term since 1985, but did not register it as a trademark for entertainment services until 1991.\nHowever, a Federal Circuit panel then unanimously reversed the first decision. It ruled that Apple could not tack its prior use of Apple Corps trademark onto its more recent streaming service.\nApple subsequently requested a rehearing of the case, specifically asking for the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) to narrow down the categories in the trademark application.\nAs part of its request, Apple claimed this case required \"an answer to a precedent-setting question of exceptional importance.\"\nApple's request for a rehearing would have the TTAB no longer consider Apple Music in services such as \"[a]rranging, organizing, conducting, and presenting concerts [and] live musical performances.\" Apple believed that would distance Apple Music from Apple Jazz, and so its trademark could then be possible.\nHowever, IP Watchdog reports that the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) has now denied Apple a rehearing."
