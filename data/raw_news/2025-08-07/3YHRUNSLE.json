  "content": "Maersk said second quarter container volumes were 4.2% higher from the same period a year ago, and raised its forecast for full-year earnings.\n\nA.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, parent company of the world\u2019s second-largest shipping line, reported revenue grew 2.8% in the quarter ended June 30 to $13.1 billion from $12.8 billion a year ago. Operating earnings (EBIT) fell to $845 million from $963 million.\n\nOcean revenue rose to $8.57 billion from $8.37 billion. EBITDA was $1.44 billion from $1.41, and EBIT came in at $229 million, down from $470 million.\n\nCopenhagen-based Maersk (OTC: AMKBY) cited geopolitical uncertainty and continued rate pressure for weaker profit, but noted continued strong results in marine terminals, volume growth in ocean shipping, and increased profitability in logistics & services. It said all segments were benefiting from continued operational improvements and lower costs.\n\nResilient market demand outside of North America led Maersk to raise its full-year 2025 financial guidance for pre-tax earnings (EBITDA) to $8 billion to $9.5 billion from $6 billion to $9 billion, and EBIT to $2 billion to $3.5 billion from unchanged to $3 billion. It left capital expenditures for 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 unchanged at $10 billion to $11 billion.\n\nGlobal container volume has been revised to between 2% and 4% from -1% and 4%. Disruptions in the Red Sea from renewed threats against shipping Houthi militia is expected to last through 2025.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have had a strong first half of the year, driven by consistent follow-through on our operational improvement plans and the successful launch of the Gemini Cooperation [with Hapag-Lloyd],\u201d said Maersk Chief Executive Vincent Clerc, in the release \u201cOur new east-west network is raising the bar on reliability and setting new industry standards. It has been a key driver of increased volumes and solid delivery of our ocean business. Even with market volatility and historical uncertainty in global trade, demand remained resilient.\u201d\n\nOcean shipping saw volumes grew 4.2% from a year ago, mainly driven by exports out of Asia. Freight rates improved in the quarter, while still being under pressure both sequentially and compared to 2024. The Gemini tie-up that began in June saw schedule reliability above the 90% target.\n\nFind more articles by Stuart Chirls here.\n\nShipbuilder sued by owner, operator of ship in deadly Baltimore bridge collapse\n\nThe post Maersk raises guidance on higher Q2 volumes appeared first on FreightWaves.",
