      "feedback": "Solid diagnostic base, but to reach world‑class you need a regime‑based, first‑principles, multi‑year scaffold that makes the causal links explicit, quantifiable, and testable. Edit toward: (1) invariant anchors and a regime map. Ground the analysis in core first principles for a macro‑financial regime (policy rule anchored to a 2% inflation target with a data‑dependent reaction function; real rate/discount‑rate dynamics; and a framework for how liquidity, risk premia, and long‑duration assets price in a world of potentially shifting inflation and growth; cite the Powell/Jackson Hole material and the five‑year policy framework review from OGK8WLL69). Add a multi‑year regime structure: Regime A baseline (inflation anchored, gradual easing possible, discount rate declining and risk assets supported); Regime B surprise inflation or policy tightening (risk assets stall or re‑price lower); Regime C AI/UBI‑driven labor dislocation with policy questions (possible secular demand shifts toward non‑career assets). (2) explicit triggers and invalidations. Define transition triggers with concrete tests: a formal Fed cut signal or unexpected hawkish shift; inflation surprise (up or down) that shifts policy stance; ETF/crypto flows turning negative; regulatory pivots (Project Crypto, GENIUS Act) materially altering institutional access; AI/UBI shocks changing labor income dynamics (NL5YYTLF2). Specify invalidations: if ETH/BTC fail to hold key levels (ETH sub‑$4k floor; BTC sub‑$100k) or if rate‑cut expectations collapse, the upside path is re‑rated lower. (3) causal chain and transmission clarity. Spell out the chain from Powell’s dovish Jackson Hole framing and the five‑year review into lower discount rates, higher valuations for long‑duration assets, and crypto via ETF inflows, corporate treasuries and staking. Tie to concrete crypto‑specific drivers: ETH ETFs inflows; institutional demand; staking share ~one‑third of supply; stablecoins driving ~40% of blockchain fees; Bitmine Immersion’s $45m purchase (OGK8WLL69). (4) robust numerical anchoring. Quote the concrete numbers from the sources rather than vague language: ETH near 4,955 and BTC touching record levels; ETH staking share ~33%; stablecoins account for 40% of blockchain fees; Bitmine’s $45m purchase; Fed funds target 4.25–4.50% with possible cuts; 2‑year yields around 3.71% around Jackson Hole environment (OGK8WLL69). (5) cross‑source consistency and conflicts. Acknowledge minor tensions (e.g., hotter July inflation data vs. expected easing) but anchor the base case to a data‑dependent, ok‑to‑drift easing path, while treating AI/UBI as a separate structural risk channel (NL5YYTLF2). (6) deliverable structure and pace. Reframe the write‑up with a clean base‑case, 2–3 transition risks, a crisp watch list, and a concise probability/volatility framing for the multi‑year horizon, while attaching each regime, trigger, and invariant to the source IDs after the relevant sentence. (7) presentation constraints. Keep it to a compact, single‑paragraph analytic frame that can be expanded into a short slide deck, with explicit place‑holders for the numbers above. This will produce a higher‑signal, discipline‑consistent piece that aligns with the horizon, strengthens the causal chain, quantifies inputs, cites the right sources, and provides clear invalidation rules and watch‑points.",
