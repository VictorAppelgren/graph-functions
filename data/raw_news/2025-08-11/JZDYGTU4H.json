  "title": "President Overplayed His Hand With China: Treyz",
  "description": "Henrietta Treyz, managing partner and director of economic policy at Veda Partners, says a 90-day tariff pause is necessary. She explains that President Trump overplayed his hand with China by imposing tariffs that are too high. She speaks with Romaine Bostick and Vonnie Quinn on \u201cThe Close,\u201d emphasizing that the constitutionality of the tariffs remains in question. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "How much thought was put into this 90 day extension, Henrietta? Is it just that the president is quite busy right now, what with Vladimir Putin coming to Alaska and so on? You know, this 90 day pause had to happen back when the U.S. and China met in Stockholm and in London. The president overplayed his hands. He put on a 145% tariff that is way too high to continue trade. And China responded very flatly, upending the entire automobile manufacturing space and defense with their magnets and rare earths export restrictions. So the president of the United States was not in a position to continue hammering China, let alone escalating the tariff rates back to 80%, which would spike inflation. And now that all eyes are on inflation data coming out tomorrow. This is not an opportunity that the president can afford to have. Tariff rates spike on $550 billion worth of goods coming in from China. So this had to occur, in my opinion. The president didn't have another play. He had to delay. Where are we on negotiations with China? I mean, the president keeps teasing that there will be a meeting with the Chinese premier at some point, but we're not really getting that many updates when it comes to the rules of the road here when it comes to tariffs. Yeah, the president's definitely hungry for a meeting. You could say that pretty clearly. Or the kids would say he's thirsty for it. That's something that they're trying to get in October. We'll see if President Xi will actually engage in that meeting. They've been promising something along those lines since the beginning of this year. I think the most important thing for the president to telegraph right now is that the Chinese will start purchasing soy and agriculture exports again from the United States. As you know, in the last six months, China has stopped 50% of its purchases of agriculture from $11.6 billion to five and a half billion dollars. So we're going to need a round of farmers bail outs and they're going to need to pick up their ag sales. The president is talking about quadrupling it, which would effectively be in getting back to states and then hopefully adding another 5 billion on top of that. The farmers need to be addressed immediately. And that's going to be anything that occurs in October would be around an agricultural component at this point. Well, eventually, to see if they can get to that and it gets to this idea, Henry, out of some of the challenges out there. And I do just want to go back to the end video, the news that we learned with regard to the 15% excise tax, if you will, on any chip sales to China. I mean, set aside the fact that the Constitution doesn't actually allow for that type of export tax, but it raises the question as to how much faith can we put into the idea that these levies, taxes, whatever you want to call in these policies, will even be around. So for investors sort of trying to make a decision as to what the impact will be. Do you have any sense that maybe these legal challenges might remove some of that clout if they're successful? It remains this is the question of the second half of 2025. It's going to be this 15% tax on Nvidia hold. Is it obviously not constitutional under the Article one, Section nine, the EPA tariffs in and of themselves are likely to be found unconstitutional by the appeals court sometime in the next few weeks, maybe a month or so out. And then you have the question of does he have to rebate and refund every single importer in the United States from whom we've collected $150 billion thus far this year? That's the outstanding question right now in the president's entire trade agenda hinges on those questions of constitutionality. Already, the Court of International Trade found unanimously that the president does not have the authority to impose tariffs under labor. I listened to the court case a week or so ago when the oral arguments were heard, and it was pretty clear that the Federal Circuit Court, the Court of Appeals, doesn't think that they have the bandwidth or the latitude constitutionally to do it. And the question then will become, what does the Supreme Court say? And we're taking this all the way to the top, I guess, is the takeaway. Yeah. And if they rule against the administration on these issues, it could actually create a little bit more volatility and chaos out there. But there's also another question, Henry, out about our trading partners. A lot of at least moved on early. Start trying to move on. And I know it's impossible to completely decouple from the world's largest economy, but the idea that they're even thinking about altering that relationship on their end, that's not something, you know, court case or not, that's necessarily going to go back to where it was pre administration. I think Canada is the clearest example of that. They're going right around the United States and negotiating directly with Mexico right now. And you're seeing that internationally with China and Africa, with south east Southeast Asian nations and China with the EU and other Southeast Asian nations. Everyone's response function has been sort of like a drop of oil in water. They've all dispersed and they're going elsewhere. And I think the Canada Mexico example is that the nearest and dearest to my heart and obviously physically closest, but those are our biggest trading partners and they can no longer have tariff free trade with the United States. 35% tariffs on Canada escalated just on Friday over lumber and they're. Still more Section 232 tariffs to come. So that's creating a, you know, a whole new group of friends internationally for everyone else, but not for us.",
