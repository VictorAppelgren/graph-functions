  "title": "Eagers Automotive Limited's (ASX:APE) biggest owners are retail investors who got richer after stock soared 3.6% last week",
  "description": "Key Insights The considerable ownership by retail investors in Eagers Automotive indicates that they collectively have...",
  "content": "\u2022 The considerable ownership by retail investors in Eagers Automotive indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy\n\u2022 A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 49% ownership\n\u2022 14% of Eagers Automotive is held by Institutions This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality. If you want to know who really controls Eagers Automotive Limited (ASX:APE), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 50% stake, retail investors possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. As a result, retail investors collectively scored the highest last week as the company hit AU$5.7b market cap following a 3.6% gain in the stock. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Eagers Automotive. Check out our latest analysis for Eagers Automotive What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Eagers Automotive? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Eagers Automotive. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Eagers Automotive's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Eagers Automotive is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is WFM Motors Pty Ltd, with ownership of 27%. With 4.0% and 2.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Argo Investments Limited are the second and third largest shareholders. In addition, we found that Keith Thornton, the CEO has 0.5% of the shares allocated to their name. Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. We can see that insiders own shares in Eagers Automotive Limited. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth AU$207m. Most would see this as a real positive. Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 50% stake in Eagers Automotive. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. Our data indicates that Private Companies hold 31%, of the company's shares. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Eagers Automotive better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that Eagers Automotive is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those shouldn't be ignored...

  "argos_summary": "Eagers Automotive Limited (ASX:APE) is largely owned by retail investors, who hold about 50% of the shares, giving them significant influence over management, while institutions own 14% and private companies 31%. The company\u2019s top shareholders include WFM Motors Pty Ltd (27%), Vanguard Group (4%) and Argo Investments (2.5%), with insiders holding a modest 3.65% stake and recent insider trades showing limited buying activity. Financially, APE has a market cap of AU$5.68\u202fbillion, revenue of AU$11.20\u202fbillion, and a modest net profit margin of 1.83%, but a high debt\u2011equity ratio of 186%. Analysts project earnings growth of 9.4% and revenue growth of 5.7% per year, with a forecast return on equity of 20.7% over three years, while the company has increased its dividend to AU$0.42 per share. Despite strong recent share price performance (over 100% YTD), the firm faces warning signs related to debt levels and limited insider buying, suggesting cautious investment consideration.",
