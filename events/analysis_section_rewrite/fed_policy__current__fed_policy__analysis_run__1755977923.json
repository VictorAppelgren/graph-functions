      "feedback": "**Actionable feedback (compact paragraph)**  \nYour draft captures the headline events but falls short on the *depth, clarity, and actionable detail* required for a 0–3‑week horizon analysis. 1) **Causal chain & market transmission**: For BOJ, explicitly link Ueda’s wage‑tightening comment to the *expected* 0.5% rate hike in January (K0WFSW29E) and the *immediate* impact on the yen (¥150‑¥155) and risk‑premium compression (cite the 0.5% hike and the 0.5‑0.7% yen move). 2) **Key levels & invalidation**: Replace vague “52‑week high” with precise price thresholds: Joby $20.95 (resistance), $18.00 (support); Opendoor $5.08 (resistance), $4.50 (support); Lucid $2.03 (resistance), $1.93 (support). 3) **Catalysts & triggers**: For Joby, note the FAA‑controlled flight on Aug 15 (TXVQ5ZQ0N) and the ANA partnership announcement on Aug 12 (TXVQ5ZQ0N). For Opendoor, highlight the new interim president on Aug 22 (H9WSBYP3D) and the Cash Plus launch on Aug 20 (H9WSBYP3D). For Lucid, mention the reverse‑split approval on Aug 23 (5JQEA5Z1T) and the 6.88% drop on Aug 23 (5JQEA5Z1T). 4) **Quantification & numbers**: Include the 192.6% annual return for Joby (TXVQ5ZQ0N), 636% Q‑over‑Q for Opendoor (H9WSBYP3D), and the 41% forecast revenue growth for Lucid (5JQEA5Z1T). 5) **Citation density**: Add inline citations after each key figure (e.g., “$20.95 (TXVQ5ZQ0N)”). 6) **First‑principles grounding**: For fundamentals, explicitly state that Joby’s 14.2× P/B (TXVQ5ZQ0N) and 0/6 valuation score (TXVQ5ZQ0N) signal overvaluation; Opendoor’s 2.92 beta (H9WSBYP3D) indicates high risk. 7) **Scenario structure**: Present a *base*, *bull*, and *bear* scenario for each stock, with clear trigger events and expected price moves. 8) **Monitoring next**: Suggest watching the BOJ policy meeting on Aug 30, the FAA certification decision on Aug 31, and the U.S. inflation report on Sep 4. 9) **Alignment with section focus**: Re‑frame the narrative to a concise 0–3‑week outlook, removing extraneous historical context (e.g., long‑term revenue growth for Lucid). 10) **Coverage of all critical sources**: Ensure every key data point is sourced (e.g., Joby’s 192.6% return from TXVQ5ZQ0N, Opendoor’s 636% Q‑over‑Q from H9WSBYP3D). 11) **Reconcile conflicts**: If any source contradicts (e.g., Joby’s valuation vs. analyst target), explicitly note the discrepancy and its implication. 12) **Avoid generic platitudes**: Replace “potential upside” with specific price targets (e.g., “Joby could test $22.00 if FAA certification is cleared”). 13) **Structure**: Use bullet points for each stock, then a short paragraph on macro drivers, then a risk/monitoring section. 14) **Tone**: Maintain a neutral, data‑driven tone; avoid subjective adjectives like “speculative rally” unless backed by a specific catalyst. 15) **Formatting**: Use consistent citation style (ID only) and avoid mixing URLs with IDs. Implement these edits to elevate the analysis to world‑class quality.",
