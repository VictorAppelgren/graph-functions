  "description": "For some high-net-worth investors, Social Security checks amount to a rounding error. But the very wealthy can still maximize the benefit.",
  "content": "For some high-net-worth investors with tens of millions of dollars, monthly Social Security checks amount to a rounding error. But it's still a mistake for these people not to optimize their benefit.\n\nSome very wealthy people figure that an extra $4,000 to $10,000 per month won't move the needle in their financial plan. But these well-to-do couples are missing the fact that their total benefit over two decades could total $2 million if both spouses wait till age 70 to take benefits. And that seven-figure sum is real money no matter if your net worth is $2 million, $20 million or $200 million.\n\nMany wealthy people don't see the value in their Social Security benefit. Nor do they grasp how they can optimize this retirement income stream and further improve their finances, says Ash Ahluwalia, head of Social Security planning at OneTeam Financial. Even if you don't need the income to pay bills, though, you can use the benefit creatively to boost your estate.\n\n\"Just because you don't need it, doesn't mean you shouldn't take it and be smart with it,\" said Ahluwalia, who specializes in optimizing Social Security benefits. \"Social Security is often off their radar. In their mind, they (think) it's not worth that much. Why bother?\"\n\nThat's a misguided approach, says Ahluwalia. Social Security benefits should be viewed strategically, just like any other financial asset.\n\nIf they do take Social Security, high-net-worth couples often defer to CPAs or conventional wisdom that says since they don't need the money, they should defer taking benefits until age 70 to maximize their return.\n\nAhluwalia takes a more strategic view. He says wealthy retirees should do just the opposite. Don't wait until age 70. Take Social Security earlier and use the income to bolster your finances.\n\nYou may take Social Security earlier, say at full retirement age. You can then use the income you earn in the first year to lock in all that $2 million lifetime benefit in a tax-efficient way with an irrevocable life insurance policy.\n\nIncome from Social Security checks can also fund potentially big bills like long-term care. It can also be used as a tax-saving tool by gifting Social Security income to charity or leaving money to heirs. \"The policy proceeds could be used to pay estate taxes or to leave a legacy to children, grandchildren or charity,\" said Steve Azoury, owner of Azoury Financial.\n\nThere are multiple ways to turn Social Security into a tax-saving estate tax tool for the wealthy, says Ahluwalia. First, you can use life insurance to lock in a \"lifetime\" of Social Security benefits.\n\nConsider this simple back-of-the-envelope example. Let's say the higher-earning spouse gets $4,000 in monthly benefits at full retirement age. The other spouse (who didn't work or worked for less than 10 years and, therefore, doesn't qualify for benefits) takes the $2,000 maximum spousal benefit, which is 50% of the higher-earning spouse's benefit at full retirement age. That's a total benefit of $6,000 a month, or $72,000 a year.\n\nThe typical advice for people who don't need the money is to defer taking Social Security until age 70 to maximize their benefit and avoid paying taxes on the benefit for three more years. IRS rules say 85% of Social Security income is taxable for married couples filing jointly with income above $44,000.\n\nWhat's the risk of doing it this way? All that extra dough will go into your estate and cost you more in personal taxes. \"But the biggest issue if you're worth $100 million isn't income taxes, it's estate taxes,\" said Ahluwalia.\n\nThe estate tax is 40%. So, that's how much tax you will pay for every dollar of income that's over the federal estate tax exemption. In 2025 the exemption is $27.98 million for married couples. So, if both spouses live 20 years in retirement, they'll get $2 million in benefits, and they'll pay income taxes along the way and potentially higher estate taxes when they pass.\n\nA bigger risk is if the couple gets hit by a bus and pass away before they collect a single check at age 70. \"Social Security keeps the two million bucks,\" said Ahluwalia.\n\nThis is where high-net-worth folks need to strategize ways to make better use of their Social Security benefits.\n\nAhluwalia advises wealthy clients to take benefits at full retirement age and use the proceeds to buy an irrevocable life insurance trust, which holds the policy outside of their taxable estate. After state and federal taxes, the $72,000 benefit at full retirement age will be closer to $45,000, or the rough amount needed to fund a pair of $1 million, 20-year term life policies.\n\nSo, the wealthy couple can use the after-tax proceeds of one year of their Social Security benefits to lock in the full estimated $2 million in benefits they would earn if they both live 20 more years beyond age 67.\n\n\"It's estate tax free,\" said Ahluwalia. \"They've converted a 'potential' $2 million income stream and turned it into a 'guaranteed' $2 million income-and estate-tax free asset. We're helping them solve an estate tax issue.\"\n\nAhluwalia says he has a client, a New York surgeon, who wanted to leave $2 million to his grandkids. \"So I said, 'Great, let's get Social Security to pay for it.'\" This strategy turns a potential income stream into a 100% tax-free asset, says Ahluwalia.\n\nThe missing link in many people's financial plans is money to cover the cost of long-term care later in life if it's needed. A 65-year-old retiring in 2025 can expect to spend an average of $172,500 on health care and medical expenses throughout retirement, says Fidelity Investments' 2025 Retiree Health Care Cost Estimate. And these costs can run much higher for elderly folks diagnosed with dementia and other cognitive impairments who require more expensive memory care services.\n\nSo, how can Social Security help defray the cost of long-term care, which regular health insurance or Medicare don't cover?\n\nOne option is to self-fund. But a more tax-efficient way is to add a long-term-care (LTC) rider on a traditional life insurance policy, says Ahluwalia. The premium is more expensive, but there are advantages.\n\nLet's go back to the tax-advantaged $2 million life insurance policy placed into trust discussed above. That traditional policy only pays a death benefit. But a hybrid life policy with the LTC rider creates two uses for the policy.\n\nIf a long-term-care event triggers a benefit, the beneficiary can now tap a portion or the entire death benefit to pay for LTC expenses. If you have a qualifying event, the insurance company will pay you either a lump sum or a percentage of your policy's death benefit each month, according to Progressive, an insurance company. Monthly allowed amounts vary but could range from 1% to 4% of the death benefit.\n\nConsider An Example\n\nLet's say each spouse has a $1 million policy. A 2% draw each month provides $20,000 per month tax-free to pay for LTC costs, taking a large bill off the table. Payouts you get for long-term care are subtracted from your final death benefit.\n\n\"So, what you're doing is you're spending your death benefit down while you're still alive to pay for long-term care costs,\" Ahluwalia said.\n\nThe benefit of a hybrid policy vs. a straight-up long-term care policy is a standard LTC policy is \"use it or lose it.\" In other words, if you buy an LTC policy and you never need coverage, all those premiums are wasted. In the hybrid approach, you know you will get the total death benefit either when you die, or through a combination of LTC payouts when you're alive and a partial death benefit when you pass.\n\n\"If you never use the LTC benefit in a hybrid policy, it pays the full death benefit,\" Ahluwalia said. \"Now you have two uses for your life insurance.\"\n\nAnother benefit: The policy is placed in the trust. It's outside your estate and not subject to taxes. In contrast, if you pull money out of a traditional IRA or 401(k) to pay LTC expenses, you'll have to pay taxes on the amount you withdraw.\n\n\"This type of policy would prevent high-net worth individuals from possibly having to take out taxable distributions to pay for this care in the future,\" Azoury said.\n\nWhen it comes to giving, you can use Social Security in two ways, says Ahluwalia. You can use your post-tax benefit checks to make tax-deductible charitable contributions. Or you can leverage your benefit by gifting a life insurance policy to a charity, paving the way for a much larger charitable contribution when you die.\n\nIn the latter case, you could place the insurance policy in an irrevocable trust and use Social Security benefits to pay for the premiums. The policy beneficiary would be a single charity or multiple charities.\n\nYou could also use benefit checks to give gifts to anyone, says Azoury. In 2025, individuals can gift up to $19,000 without any tax consequences and lower their estate value in the process.\n\n\"All in all, even though the income isn't vital to a high-net-worth individual's lifestyle, it can be a nice bonus to their overall financial situation,\" said Azoury.",

      "text": "Even headed into a tumultuous year for the S&P 500, millionaires were surprisingly steady with where they put their money.\nHigh-net-worth investors (HNWI) barely changed their asset allocation coming into 2025, says a new report from Capgemini Research Institute. Of the five major asset classes millionaires invest in, two were completely unchanged entering 2025 as compared with their levels coming into 2024.\nAnd of the three asset classes that did change, the modifications were tiny. Wealthy investors took down their allocation to bonds by just 2% to 18%. And they shifted half of that small amount of freed-up capital to inch up exposure to cash and the rest to stock.\n\"Cash holdings remained a vital asset class for HNWI investors as market volatility and fears of geopolitical tensions prompted a flight to safety,\" said the report.\nBut overall, wealthy investors appear to be mostly staying the course.\nMillionaires Remain Somewhat Bullish\nWealthy investors are willing to scurry into cash when they're nervous. But that's not the case now.\nIn fact, with just 26% of their portfolios in cash, that's considerably less than the panicked 34% allocation to cash in 2023. Cash is getting tougher to ignore. The yield on the JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income ETF (JPST) is up to an attractive 4.9%. Safe assets like cash get more attractive at or around the 5% level.\nBut rich investors are not just exiting the stock market, either. Millionaire investors also added to their exposure to stocks to 22%. That's their second-largest position, following cash. And so far, it's paying off despite the volatility in April. The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) is up nearly 13% in a year's time.\nIf there's any change, it's that wealthy investors don't see as much opportunity in bonds. They trimmed their exposure to 18%. It's easy to see why. With the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND) yielding just 3.7%, investors simply aren't getting paid for the risk they're taking. Meanwhile, millionaire investors held their positions steady in real estate and alternatives at 19% and 15% weightings, respectively.\nWhere Are Millionaires Coming From?\nNorth America continues to be the hot spot for millionaires. The wealth of millionaires grew the fastest, 8.9%, in North America. The number of millionaires, too, grew the most in the region: by 7.3%.\nIn contrast, the wealth of millionaires only grew 4.8% in Asia and 0.7% in Europe.\nBut overall, the ranks of the wealthy continue to grow. Global high-net-worth wealth rose 4.2% in 2024.\n\"To leverage market momentum and tackle volatility, HNWIs are rebalancing their portfolios by pairing capital protection and return potential, resulting in a relatively stable asset allocation, very similar to that seen during 2024,\" the report said.\nMillionaires' Portfolios Mostly Unchanged For 2025\n| Asset class | 2025 allocation | '25 allocation change | Representative ETF | Symbol | 1-year change | Yield |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Cash and equivalents | 26% | 1% | JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income | JPST | 0.4% | 4.9% |\n| Stock | 22% | 1% | Vanguard Total Stock Market | VTI | 12.6% | 1.3 |\n| Fixed income | 18% | -2% | Vanguard Total Bond Market | BND | 0.7% | 3.7 |\n| Real estate | 19% | 0% | Vanguard Real Estate | VNQ | 7.5% | 3.8 |\n| Alternatives | 15% | 0% | NYLI Hedge Multi-Strategy Tracker | QAI | 3.0% | 2.2 |"

      "text": "President Joe Biden's proposal to nearly double the capital gains tax rate to 39.6% is unnerving investors. But there's a legal way to delay \u2014 if not dodge \u2014 the tax hit: ETFs.\nExchange traded funds' unique structure largely shields them from capital gains taxes on annual distributions. Thanks to how ETFs buy and sell securities inside of tradable baskets, there's almost never taxable capital gains distributions during the year. Mutual funds routinely pay investors capital gains distributions late in the year, which are immediately taxable when held in taxable accounts.\nProposed hikes in capital gains aren't likely to affect most people. Taxpayers with annual incomes over $1 million are the target. And if you sell an ETF, as with any stock, the gain is still a taxable event. But the threat of rising capital gain tax rates is putting ETFs' tax efficiency over mutual funds top of mind.\n\"Rightly or wrongly, investors and their advisors will become more tax-conscious,\" said Lara Crigger, managing editor of ETFTrends.com. \"This will encourage investors to take a closer look at ETFs, which are far more tax efficient than mutual funds for most contexts.\"\nETF Tax Efficiency Shines With Capital Gains Tax\nETFs are usually more tax efficient than mutual funds, says Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA.\nWhy? ETFs' unique \"in-kind mechanism\" allows them to avoid incurring capital gains during the year. ETFs don't usually trigger a capital gains tax event for those who still own the ETF shares. Additionally, most stock ETFs are based on indexes, which do not buy or sell securities very often. Rosenbluth found that large U.S. stock ETFs usually trade just 4% of their positions annually.\nThat means only three out of nearly 600 stock ETFs from Blackrock's iShares, Invesco, Charles Schwab, State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard passed along any capital gains to shareholders in 2020, Rosenbluth found.\nIn contrast, mutual funds routinely shuffle 20% of their positions or more annually. That can generate taxable capital gains that must be passed on to the funds' owners each year. And more important, mutual funds facing redemptions must sell positions to cash out investors who redeem. This can gin up taxable capital gains distributions for the remaining mutual fund holders.\nRosenbluth found 37 of T. Rowe Price's 39 domestic stock mutual funds passed along a capital gain to investors in 2020. That includes T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX), which distributed 9.2% of its net asset value to investors. The highest capital gains distribution among ETFs was iShares Evolved U.S. Innovative Healthcare (IEIH), at just 1.7% of its value.\nYou don't pay a capital gains tax on individual stocks until you sell like ETFs, either. But it's easier to hold on to a diversified ETF for a long time than an individual stock.\nETFs Don't Avoid All Capital Gains Tax\nBut it's important to note that ETFs aren't completely immune from capital gains taxes, Crigger says. If you sell winning ETFs, you'll still likely owe capital gains tax on the gain. You decide the timing of when you incur ETF capital gains, though. With mutual funds, you don't control annual distributions.\nETFs have another edge here, too. If you never sell ETFs and donate them at death to your family or charity, you can avoid capital gains taxes altogether, says Dave Nadig, director of research at ETFTrends.com. That's because the cost basis of the ETF is \"stepped up\" to the value upon your death. So when the beneficiary sells the ETF, there's no taxable event.\nBiden, though, is proposing to do away with this stepped-up basis rule for any gains over $1 million for individuals and $2.5 million per couple with real estate exemptions.\nCapital Gains Tax: Reality Vs. Fear\nThe threat of higher capital gains tax rates is only heating up a shift to ETFs that's been going on for years. Do you know how to find top ETFs?\nMoney flowed into stock ETFs in 20 of the past 25 months through the end of January, Nadig says. Money flowed out of stock mutual funds in 24 of those 25 months. And this year through April 14, $117 billion flowed out of stock mutual funds, Rosenbluth says. At the same time, more than $229 billion in new ETF issuance has taken place.\nIt's true that most mutual funds are held in tax-deferred retirement accounts. And dividends on both ETFs and mutual funds are taxable when paid. But ETFs' tax edge is appealing, whether investors wind up paying the higher capital gains tax or not, Rosenbluth says.\nBiden's proposal for a capital gains tax rate hike \"will likely impact a small universe of investors,\" Rosenbluth said. But Crigger adds: \"Biden's tax proposal, in whatever form it takes, even if it never comes to fruition at all, will be a net gain for ETF assets. When people are motivated to take a closer look at the tax impact of their investments, they almost always gravitate toward ETFs.\"\nETFs' Tax Shield\nNone of the largest ETFs paid capital gains distributions in 2020\n| ETF | Symbol | Expense ratio | Assets in billions | 2020 capital gains distribution |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust | (SPY) | 0.09% | $359.9 | $0 |\n| iShares Core S&P 500 | (IVV) | 0.03% | 277.9 | $0 |\n| Vanguard Total Stock Market | (VTI) | 0.03% | 240.5 | $0 |\n| Vanguard S&P 500 | (VOO) | 0.03% | 220.5 | $0 |\n| Invesco QQQ Trust | (QQQ) | 0.20% | 163.9 | $0 |\nSources: IBD, ETF.com, company reports\nFollow Matt Krantz on Twitter @mattkrantz\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nBank of America Names Top 11 Stock Picks For 2021\n8 Top Stocks Will Soar Again In 2021, Analysts Say\nMarketSmith: Research, Charts, Data And Coaching All In One Place"

      "text": "Retirement planning involves lots of guesswork. You need to estimate how long you'll live, your rate of return on your nest egg and how inflation might erode its value. Then there's this big question: Will you need long-term care and, if so, how much will long-term care insurance cost?\nProjecting how much you and your spouse might spend on long-term care is not easy. The answer can range from zero to an annual nursing home bill that exceeds $100,000.\n- View Full Special Report: Supercharge Your Retirement\n- Retirement Preparation Is In Crisis Mode: How Can Americans Repair It\n- How To Calculate If Retirement Is On Track\n- 8 Ways To Save That Do Not Include 401(k)s\nWhile about one-third of today's 65-year-olds may never need long-term care, roughly 20% will require it for longer than five years.\nCalculate The Price Tag For Long-Term Care\nMedicare does not pay for most long-term care, so the choice for many pre-retirees is whether to self-insure or buy long-term-care insurance. And buying insurance presents its own risks.\nLong-term-care insurance has a rocky history since its rollout in the 1980s. Once it caught on with consumers, it gained popularity until many insurers realized they mispriced the policies and paid out more in benefits than they projected. So they eventually gave up.\n\"Many insurers stopped selling long-term-care insurance because they were bad at it,\" said Scott Olson, co-owner of insurance broker LTCShop.com. \"They didn't know how to do it.\"\nIs Insurance The Right Solution?\nOnly about a dozen insurers currently sell long-term-care policies, compared to more than 100 in the 1990s. Some carriers tried to stay in the game in the 2000s by imposing steep premium hikes. Policyholders could avoid big price increases by choosing more restrictive terms including a longer waiting period before benefits start and a reduced daily benefit.\nWhile premiums vary widely based on age, health and other factors, a 55-year-old man might pay about $1,700 a year on average, according to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance. Women tend to pay more because they usually need care longer than men do.\nLike many experts, Olson urges people to buy long-term-care insurance in their 50s. If you wait too long, you not only risk higher premiums but also might become uninsurable due to health problems.\nChanges in medical underwriting can affect whether you qualify for coverage. Insurers constantly adjust their standards to reflect new data on treating health conditions.\nLong-Term Care Insurance Costs Soar\n\"Five years ago, long-term-care insurance companies weren't concerned with sleep apnea,\" Olson said. \"Today, they are cracking down. If you have sleep apnea, you better be really compliant in using your CPAP [machine]. And if you had insulin-dependent diabetes five years ago, you'd be automatically declined.\" That's no longer the case.\nSome products combine life insurance with a long-term-care rider. These hybrid policies may offer a percentage of the death benefit to pay for long-term care.\nHybrids are generally more expensive because you're getting two types of insurance rolled into one. Some insurers charge a one-time upfront premium that can exceed $100,000. Before buying, shoppers should ask about \"guaranteed cash value\" on the life insurance part of the policy so that they're assured of earning a set interest rate even if the market declines.\nOther strategies to fund long-term care don't involve insurance at all. Homeowners age 62 and over can get a reverse mortgage to convert home equity into cash to cover long-term care. And if you have a health savings account, you can withdraw the money tax-free as long as you spend it on qualified expenses, which can include long-term care.\nPlan To Live Where You Will Get Support\nPlanning for long-term care isn't just a matter of finding enough money to cover it. You also want to control other variables to minimize your risk.\nAsk yourself questions such as, \"Will friends and family, especially younger ones, be around to help if I need long-term care?\" and \"Do I live in a home where I can age in place and/or in a community where I can get support?\" said Susan Reinhard, senior vice president at AARP Public Policy Institute.\nAge-friendly communities are more accessible to people with disabilities and promote socialization. It's possible to delay the onset of costly long-term care if you can tap wide-ranging support networks.\nThrough the Village to Village Network, for example, hundreds of villages have sprung up across the U.S. where seniors benefit from neighbors who help get their groceries, drive them to medical appointments and offer other assistance.\nWhere Can You Spend Less On Long-Term Care Insurance Costs?\nHigher-income adults who worry about long-term care may consider moving to a continuing care retirement community. If they don't want to leave their current home, a related option called \"continuing care at home\" is sprouting up in some parts of the country.\nUnder this model, you purchase a contract that combines long-term care insurance with home-care support services (such as aides who help with activities of daily living) and care management benefits. While the structure of these contracts varies, they often require a high upfront fee along with monthly or annual payments.\nState government is playing a role as well, Reinhard adds. Many states are exploring ways to allow residents to remain in their home and hire aides as needed, rather than move into a nursing home.\nIn 2019, Washington became the first state to set up a public long-term-care benefit. Under the Long Term Care Trust Act, workers will pay 0.58% of their wages into the program and can eventually claim a lifetime maximum of $36,500 per person in benefits for services like skilled nursing care, meal preparation and home health services if they couldn't perform at least three tasks of daily life.\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nSee IBD Stock Lists & Get Pass/Fail Ratings For All Your Stocks With IBD Digital\nYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income\nCheck Out IBD's New IBD Live Panel Discussion\nBuild Your Retirement Portfolio With These Best Mutual Funds\nWhich Stocks Are Breaking Out Or Near A Pivot Point?

      "text": "What do two of the world's richest billionaires have in common? They both own huge stakes in the same S&P 500 stock: Tesla (TSLA).\nBoth Elon Musk and Larry Ellison are now among the top four richest people in the world, says the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index. Musk is No. 1 and Ellison is No. 4. And both can largely thank their Tesla stock for that. Musk is the largest owner of Tesla stock. And Ellison, founder of Oracle (ORCL), is the seventh largest Tesla owner ahead of even mutual fund giant Fidelity.\nAnyone riding Tesla stock's powerful 120% gain this year is profiting handsomely. But these S&P 500 company founders are living testaments to the power of placing big bets on top-performing stocks.\nStock Market Forecast For Next 6 Months: Here's What Experts Say\n\"To date Tesla's stock has been valued as a disruptive technology player that is transforming (electric vehicle) adoption globally in this green tidal wave,\" said Wedbush's Dan Ives. \"However, Musk & Co. have built an EV castle with its supercharger network, battery technology ... and software ecosystem that is unmatched globally compared to any other auto player in our opinion.\"\nBig Bets On Tesla Stock Pay Off Big\nIt's not surprising to see Musk such a large holder of Tesla stock. He's considered the person to make the company what it is now. What is notable, though, is the size of the position he's maintained over the 20 years since its founding.\nMusk still owns more than 411 million shares of Tesla. That amounts to nearly 13% of the company \u2014 more than anyone else, says an Investor's Business Daily analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence and MarketSmith. And that's paying off handsomely this year. The value of Musk's stake has risen $60.6 billion just this year.\nThe massive size of Musk's remaining ownership stake is noteworthy, including in comparison to other high-tech founders who have lightened up.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates, via the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, only owns 0.5% of that company now. And even Jeff Bezos' stake in Amazon.com (AMZN) has whittled down to just 9.7% (he's still the No. 1 holder of the stock). And Alphabet (GOOGL) co-founder Larry Page is only the No. 3 largest holder with 6.1% of the Google parent's stock.\nEllison's Big Bets Pay Off\nEllison, though, seems to understand not only the power of Tesla, but also concentrated positions.\nHis 45 million shares of Tesla added $6.6 billion in wealth to his portfolio this year alone. Ellison's position is more than 700% larger than that of Cathie Wood's ARK Invest, although her name is more closely linked to Tesla than his is.\nAnd Tesla isn't even the very top reason Ellison is back in the top five richest people in the world. For that, he can thank his holding onto a staggering 42% of Oracle, the tech company he founded nearly five decades ago.\nThe value of his 1.15 billion Oracle shares has risen more than $46 billion this year. Shares of Oracle are up nearly 50% this year on the company's inroads in AI software and services. No investor comes anywhere near his ownership position in the company. Even ETF giant Vanguard only owns 5% of the company and is a distant second to Ellison.\nDiversification can certainly help cushion portfolios in tough markets. But as Musk and Ellison prove, when an S&P 500 stock is rocking, you want to own as much as possible.\nTesla Titans\nLargest owners of Tesla shares\n| Holder | Shares held (millions) | % Of Co. |\n|---|---|---|\n| Elon Musk | 411.1 | 12.9% |\n| Vanguard Group | 220.6 | 6.9 |\n| BlackRock | 178.7 | 5.6 |\n| State Street Global Advisors | 99.7 | 3.1 |\n| Capital Research and Management | 53.1 | 1.6 |\n| Geode Capital Management | 50.0 | 1.5 |\n| Lawrence J. Ellison | 45.0 | 1.4 |\n| FMR | 29.4 | 0.9 |\n| Norges Bank Investment Management | 28.1 | 0.8 |\n| Northern Trust Global Investments | 27.1 | 0.8 |\nSources: IBD, S&P Global Market Intelligence\nFollow Matt Krantz on Twitter @mattkrantz\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:"

      "text": "The latest update on Social Security's shaky finances was a tad more bearish than last year.\nAnd that raises the question: Do potential benefit cuts starting in 2034 mean Americans should rethink when they start taking Social Security?\nFirst the bad news: More money is coming out of the Social Security fund than is coming in. As a result, the latest projection from the Social Security Board of Trustees is that it won't be able to pay 100% of benefits for the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance trust fund starting in 2034. That's a year earlier than projected last year.\nIf Congress doesn't act to shore up the entitlement program, which currently pays benefits to 70 million beneficiaries, there will only be enough revenue to pay 77% of benefits starting in 2034. That equates to a 23% pay cut for Social Security beneficiaries.\nShould You Speed Up Your Social Security Claim?\nThe latest update will no doubt cause many Americans to fear the worst. Many may opt to take their benefit checks as early as age 62. But despite the latest numbers, savers shouldn't make decisions based on speculative headlines or financial outcomes that might not happen.\nMore than 50% of people over age 65 depend on Social Security for more than half of their income, according to the Social Security Administration, or SSA. Congress will likely move to fix the funding problem, says Lindsay Theodore, a certified financial planner at T. Rowe Price (TROW).\n\"A lot of retired people would be very upset,\" said Theodore. \"We don't think it's likely that everyone's benefits are going to be dropped by 23%. And we don't think that people should change their (Social Security and retirement) planning in anticipation of that.\"\nStill, there's much uncertainty surrounding Social Security. That includes its long-term financing gap and recent government cuts to staffing and field offices. Many individuals claimed benefits earlier than planned as a result, says Martha Shedden, president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts. NARSSA is an organization that helps people optimize their Social Security claiming decisions.\nSome 10% of pre-retirees say they claimed Social Security earlier than planned due to skepticism about Social Security benefits, according to a T. Rowe Price retirement and savings study published in March.\nThe Cost Of Claiming Social Security Early\nBut taking Social Security early is costly. Taking benefits at age 62 means your benefit would be about 30% lower than taking benefits at the full retirement age. The full retirement age for people born after 1960 is 67, says the SSA. Each extra year you wait to take benefits, the higher your lifetime benefit.\nAnd if you wait until 70 to take benefits, the government will add 8% to your benefit for each full year you delay taking benefits after your full retirement date.\nCraig Ferrantino, president of Craig James Financial Services, says the uncertainty surrounding Social Security's solvency hasn't changed the advice he offers clients about when and why to take benefits.\n\"Nothing's changed in what we normally tell people,\" said Ferrantino. If you can wait to take benefits and get a larger benefit, that's a good thing, he says. Taking Social Security early results in people with low-dollar benefit amounts that make it harder to sustain their lifestyle in retirement.\nAge and longevity \u2014 not Social Security solvency concerns \u2014 still matter most when making Social Security claiming decisions. \"I want to know if a client's parents are still alive. What age did they pass? If they have siblings, how's their health? If you feel your health isn't good, that to me is the best justification to take Social Security as soon as you can.\"\nOutpace The 20% Cut?\nDoes the possibility of getting a Social Security check that's roughly 20% smaller starting in 2034 mean you should take benefits early? Is there a different claiming analysis to do? Is it time to redo the math?\n\"There is a bit more cause for alarm than last year, but it's not a significant change,\" said Shedden. \"However, people should not make their claiming decisions based on (the Social Security fund's potential depletion), something that has been talked about for the last 15 years.\"\nWhat's more, the way benefits are funded or paid is unchanged, Shedden says. Most of the confusion surrounding Social Security has to do with lower staffing levels. That sparks the issue of the inconvenience of applying for benefits and getting questions answered, Shedden adds.\nWill Congress Bail Out Social Security?\nCongress has a few options to shore up Social Security. Some potential revenue generating fixes, according to the \"Social Security at 90\" report, include eliminating the payroll tax cap (currently at $176,100) for those making more than $400,000 and gradually raising the payroll tax from 6.2% to 7.2%. Of course, there is also the option of raising the full retirement age or increasing taxes to cover the cost of Social Security.\nThere's no guarantee that Congress won't make the necessary fixes to shore up Social Security and keep full benefit payments coming, says Shedden. \"It's highly unlikely that nothing is done,\" said Shedden.\nClaiming early will cost you money. Taking benefits early at 62 locks in roughly 30% less Social Security pay. So, panicking and succumbing to fear that Social Security will pay smaller benefits in the future could penalize you financially.\nShedden offers a back-of-the-envelope analysis to highlight why taking benefits early could backfire.\n\"Going forward as a new retiree, would you not rather have a higher benefit that would be cut by 20% than a lower benefit?\" said Shedden.\nDo The Math With Social Security\nHere's a hypothetical example. Let's say the SSA estimates taking Social Security at 62 will net $2,561 a month. Starting benefits at 67 results in a check of $3,494. And waiting until 70 swells the monthly benefit to $4,332 per month. Now, let's shave off 20%. Your take-home check each month if you take Social Security at 62 shrinks to $2,049. But after a 20% cut, you'll still receive a benefit of $2,795 at full retirement age and $3,465 if you wait until age 70 to take benefits.\n\"Why would you claim early? That's doing a disservice to yourself,\" said Shedden.\nSome Social Security experts say this key retirement funding source is too big too fail. Social Security is the foundation of economic security for most Americans. In fact, monthly benefit checks for low earners who take Social Security at full retirement age replace an estimated 78% of preretirement income, according to the SSA. Social Security benefits replace 42% of income for medium earners and 28% of high earners' income.\nDelaying Social Security can also help make retirees' retirement account balances last longer, according to a T. Rowe Price study.\n\"When clients postpone taking Social Security, they may initially rely more heavily on their investment portfolios to meet income needs,\" according to T. Rowe Price. \"However, once Social Security benefits kick in at age 70, the increased value of those benefits significantly reduces the size of withdrawals needed from their retirement portfolio. By reducing annual drawdown amounts, the retirement portfolio can last longer.\"\nWeigh Your Situation When Claim Social Security\nThe goal is to optimize your Social Security benefits by making prudent claiming decisions that are the right fit for your personal circumstances.\nFor folks who are single and who never married, the claiming decision is more straightforward as there's no need, for example, to factor in spousal benefits or survivor benefits as married couples must do. \"There are so many rules that apply to benefits that you need to do a very precise analysis,\" said Shedden.\nFor those nervous savers who think Social Security benefits will eventually be cut, there are moves you can make now to make up for the income gap that benefit cuts may cause, says Theodore of T. Rowe Price.\n\"If you still have the time, save more,\" said Theodore. Investing in a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA, which offer tax-free withdrawals, is a good strategy. Why? You'll need to withdraw less dollars to fund your retirement than you would taking withdrawals from a traditional 401(k), which are taxed as ordinary income.\nAnother way to offset a lower income stream from Social Security is to begin to trim your expenses ahead of retirement, Theodore advises. \"So, if you're in a position where you could pay down the mortgage a little earlier, put more money towards that,\" said Theodore.\nYou could also take a sum of retirement savings and buy an annuity that generates the amount of monthly income that you could lose if benefits are reduced, adds Ferrantino. \"Take charge of your own pension,\" said Ferrantino.\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nNvidia Slides As AI Giant Touts Blackwell Momentum, But Margin Worries Hit Stock\nTesla Stock Keeps Falling.

      "text": "As you near retirement, you face a key decision: when to take your Social Security benefit.\nThe prevailing wisdom is to wait until age 70 if possible. That's because even though most people can start receiving benefits as early as age 62, it pays to delay.\nWaiting until 70 enables you to get the largest benefit possible \u2014 for the rest of your life. Financial pros often recommend that you delay claiming benefits until age 70. That is, as long as you have sufficient assets to cover your living expenses through your 60s. And, as long as you expect to live into your mid-80s and beyond.\nBut for savvy investors, bucking the conventional wisdom can sometimes pay off.\nReasons To Take Social Security Benefits Early\n\"Most analyses of this question (of when to apply for Social Security) neglect to include the investment benefit of taking the benefit early,\" said Howard Erman, a certified financial planner in Seal Beach, Calif.\nLike many financial advisors, Erman uses software to run projections that compare annual benefit amounts based on various assumptions. The goal is to help clients determine when they might come out ahead under different scenarios.\nArmed with your break-even age \u2014 when cumulative Social Security benefits even out \u2014 you can decide the best timing.\nErman often highlights the advantages of taking Social Security at full retirement age (between 66 and 67 for many people). As long as people invest all or most of the benefits in a prudent, diversified manner \u2014 and let it grow for years to come \u2014 they can build a bigger nest egg than if they waited until 70 to start receiving benefits.\n\"It usually takes 12 to 20 years to get even,\" Erman said. If they already have sufficient retirement assets, \"by taking benefits at an earlier age, they can use the additional income to travel or enjoy whatever that money can buy.\"\nBalancing Longevity And Inheritance Goals\nHealthy retirees may hope to live into their 90s. But Erman warns that if health issues arise, those who waited until 70 to maximize their benefit will collect that money at an advanced age when they are infirm and least able to savor it.\n\"Unless maximizing the inheritance is the primary goal, which is true only for a minority of clients, then the benefit should be taken early, well before age 70,\" he said.\nRead More In Our IBD 2024 Retirement Special Report. Plus, Find New Ways To Boost Retirement Income, And See Cures For Retirees' 5 Biggest Health Care Fears.\nFor married couples where one spouse is much younger, delaying until 70 can make sense, Erman adds. If the older spouse, who is also the higher-earner, dies first, the surviving spouse could receive a higher benefit for life.\nTaking your Social Security benefit well before 70 \u2014 and investing it \u2014 carries risk. The strategy worked for many retirees during the past 15 years, when markets rose. But there's no guarantee the next decade or two will produce average or above-average returns.\n\"If you're bullish on the market and give up the delayed credits, you can try to outgrow the difference you'd receive by waiting,\" said Michael Carbone, a certified financial planner in Chelmsford, Mass. \"But if you start taking benefits early when a recession is about to start and subsequent investment returns don't work out how you expect,\" bad timing can sabotage your strategy.\nPros And Cons Of When To Take Social Security Early\nFor Carbone, the current climate heightens the risk. Given high stock valuations and geopolitical turmoil, the odds of market volatility increase.\nSome investors deem themselves smarter than their peers. They are sure they can beat the 8% added benefit for each full year they delay Social Security beyond their full retirement age.\nFrom IBD, Risk Management In The Stock Market: How Much Money To Invest Now\n\"It's possible to do better,\" said Sita Slavov, professor of public policy at George Mason University. \"It's also possible to do a lot worse.\"\nFear that Social Security could run out of money is the No. 1 reason for claiming early, according to a 2023 survey from Schroders, an asset management firm.\nAbout 44% of respondents said their doubts about the system's solvency drove them to take Social Security benefits sooner.\nMany experts downplay such worries. While some structural reforms are likely over the long haul, the youngest baby boomers are probably safe.\n\"For those 55 and over, no changes in benefits will occur,\" Slavov said. \"If you're under 55, there may be changes.\"\nWill Social Security COLA Keep Up With Inflation?\nSocial Security benefits are designed to keep pace with inflation thanks to cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). Benefits increased by 3.2% for 2024. Slavov calls Social Security \"an inflation-indexed life annuity.\"\n\"Part of what makes delaying so compelling is the higher base for future COLAs,\" Carbone said. \"One of the proposals put forth by the (Social Security) trustees is to reduce future COLAs. Although I don't feel this is a highly compelling argument, it's worth thinking about when weighing the decision.\"\nAnother questionable case for taking Social Security early is the belief \"I've been paying in my whole working life and I want to get it for as long as I can,\" says Mitch Anthony, author of \"The New Retirementality.\" While it's understandable to want to get your hands on the money as soon as possible, that alone isn't a reason to act.\nWaiting to retire until your full retirement age \u2014 even if you don't wait for your 70th birthday \u2014 can add tens of thousands of dollars a year to your income. As people live longer and healthier lives, this additional money can expand your lifestyle choices into your 90s.\nOn the other hand, you may have chronic health conditions or multiple risk factors that lead you to think you won't live to a ripe old age. If so, it's tempting to use that rationale to take your Social Security benefit early and spend it while you can.\nMore: Learn How To Save On Fees With DIY Ideas. And Read What Empower CEO Ed Murphy Says About Using AI For Retirement Planning.\nPrognosis For You And Your Money\nBut predicting your life expectancy is a tricky business.\n\"You might live longer than you think,\" said Martha Shedden, co-founder and president of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts. \"You might not die on time. A lot of people are really surprised\" at how they outlast their expected expiration date.\nRather than deciding when to apply for Social Security benefits based on a hunch of when you'll die, seek input from each of your medical providers. Enlist your primary-care physician as well as your cardiologist, pulmonologist and other specialists.\n\"In a candid discussion with your doctor, ask, 'What's my prognosis for life expectancy?'\" said Mark J. Orr, a certified financial planner in Alpharetta, Ga. \"That's better than saying, 'My parents died young from cancer. I will too.' Don't rely on that.\"\nIf you're eager to take your Social Security benefit at 62 and start investing the funds right away, think twice if you're still working. You can collect Social Security while you work, but you'll pay a price.\n\"If you're still working, your benefit might be lower because you're subject to the earnings test,\" said Orr, author of \"Social Security Income Planning.\" That's because people who are younger than full retirement age and earn more than the annual earnings limit receive a reduced benefit.\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nMoney Making You Miserable?

The strategy also allows funds to cover long\u2011term care, make charitable gifts, or provide a tax\u2011free legacy. While conventional wisdom recommends deferring to age 70 to maximize payouts, the article highlights that early claims can be advantageous if the retiree has sufficient assets and expects to live into their 80s, and that market returns and personal health should guide the decision.
