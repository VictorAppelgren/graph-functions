      "summary": "Trump’s 2025 executive orders to accelerate fossil‑fuel infrastructure are expected to boost midstream oil and gas companies, with pipeline operators such as Williams, Kinder Morgan, and others poised to benefit from streamlined NEPA reviews and a national energy emergency designation. The article lists 22 midstream firms that could see higher demand for transportation and storage services as upstream production ramps up, especially in Alaska and reopened offshore drilling areas. In contrast, Sports Entertainment Group Limited in Australia reported a worsening loss of AU$0.018 per share for FY 2025, a decline in earnings growth, and a 28% share‑price rise in July amid mixed investor sentiment. The company’s financials show negative earnings, modest debt, and a high beta, indicating volatility relative to the broader media market.",
