  "description": "The world of tool ownership is rife with loyalty to certain brands, yet in a globalized world it can be difficult to know exactly who owns your favorite.",
  "content": "Here's Who Really Owns All Of The Major Tool Brands\n\nThe power tool market is crowded with a plethora of brands claiming to offer the best performance or value for money, and sometimes choosing between them can be a matter of simply picking your favorite brand. Most regular tool users have one or more brands they favor and others they prefer to avoid, but many are unsure which corporation benefits when they purchase tools from a specific brand. While in some cases, tool brands are independent companies with decades of history, in other cases, what seem to be familiar names are in fact owned by international conglomerates that you might never have heard of. Several of the biggest American toolmaking brands are no longer owned by American companies, having been the subject of acquisitions or mergers. Some are recent, while others have been foreign-owned for decades, and it can be hard to keep track of who owns what. These major tool brands all have decades of history and are well-known names in the American tool market, but who owns the name may surprise you.\n\nSkil recently celebrated its 100th anniversary, having been founded in 1924. The brand was the result of a collaboration between Joseph W. Sullivan and Edmond Michel, with the latter inventing an electric handsaw after watching workers cut sugar cane at a plantation. The tool was the first of its kind and was intended to help those workers cut through cane faster and easier, but it eventually became popular for a much wider variety of uses. Saws remain a key part of the brand's tool lineup today, but it has also expanded its range to offer a broad variety of products spanning everything from lawnmowers to measuring tools. In 1996, Skil was bought by the German Bosch Group, and remained under the group's ownership for more than two decades. During much of that time, Chinese toolmaker Chervon Group acted as a supplier for Bosch and eventually entered into a partnership in the Chinese market. By 2016, Chervon had announced its intention to buy the Skil brand outright from Bosch, and in 2017, that acquisition was completed. Since then, Skil has been a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chervon Group and is one of several familiar tool brands that the Chinese company owns.\n\nWhile it is far from the oldest toolmaking brand on the market, Ryobi can trace its roots back further than many enthusiasts might realize. The brand was first founded in Japan in 1943 as Ryobi Seisakusho Co., Ltd. in Fuchu, a city in Hiroshima Prefecture. It initially made die-cast parts for the Japanese military, but by the late 1940s, it had pivoted towards making parts for Japan's automobile industry. Over the next decade or so, the company grew significantly, and by the 1960s, Ryobi had expanded into the production of printing presses, cameras (sold under the Minolta brand), and power tools. In 1985, Ryobi launched its first manufacturing base in the U.S., but the end of the Japanese economic bubble during the 1990s saw many of its production divisions become unprofitable. To keep itself afloat as a company, Ryobi was forced to sell off a number of those divisions, including its North American power tools business. The power tools operation was acquired in 2000 by Techtronic Industries (TTI) and remains owned by the same company today. Much like Chervon, China-based TTI owns multiple other brands that will be recognizable to American buyers, including Homelite and Hoover.\n\nThe TTI portfolio includes the likes of Ryobi and Homelite, but arguably the most well-regarded brand under its ownership is Milwaukee. Techtronic acquired Milwaukee in 2005, but the brand was first founded back in 1924. Its earliest success came when Henry Ford asked the company to develop a new power drill to help speed up his automobile production lines. In response, Milwaukee's founder developed the Hole Shooter, a \u00bc-inch one-handed drill that fit Ford's brief perfectly. The company brought out new tools over the following years, with 1949 proving to be a particularly important year for the company. That year, Milwaukee launched a sander/grinder and a \u00bd-inch right-angle drill, which both proved highly popular. The Sawzall was launched in 1951 and ended up being an even bigger sales hit. Various other influential tools were launched over the next three decades, but one of the most significant changes arrived when TTI acquired the company in the mid-'00s. Shortly after the acquisition, the brand launched its first cordless tool range with interchangeable batteries, a technology that has become a huge part of the brand's appeal in the years since.\n\nNot every tool brand is under the umbrella of another company. Japanese brand Makita remains independent after more than 100 years of operation, and still operates out of the same head office location in Anjo that it has occupied since 1945. The brand itself is even older, being initially founded in 1915. It has always specialized in electrical equipment, but initially built transformers and lighting equipment, as well as motors. Its 1958 electric planer was a first for a Japanese toolmaker, and its success saw Makita rebranded as primarily an electric power tool company the following year. The same year, its first power tool exports began. Initially, Makita exported its tools to Australia, but it slowly expanded its international reach. The American division of Makita was formed in 1970, with new ventures in Europe also established over the next few years. The brand's first battery-powered tool, the 6010D drill, arrived in 1978, and in less than a decade, Makita had also launched its first battery-powered outdoor tool, the UH3000D hedge trimmer. The company has further expanded in Europe and Asia in more recent decades, and now makes its power tools in a variety of locations around the world. It produced its last combustion-powered tool in 2022, and since then, its entire global power tool lineup has consisted of electric tools.\n\nOne of the longest-lived names in the American tool industry is DeWalt, which, like its rival Milwaukee, was first founded in 1924. The brand's yellow and black tools can be found on jobsites across America. Unlike Milwaukee, the brand is still owned by an American company. DeWalt was first founded by Raymond DeWalt, who developed a unique adjustable radial arm saw. Despite bearing his name, the DeWalt company wasn't owned by Raymond for long. Shortly after founding it, he sold it to two investors, Isaac Rutt and Paul Gardner, who were responsible for developing the company during its early years. In 1960, Black & Decker acquired DeWalt. From then, it would be over three decades until the next pivotal moment in the company's history. That moment was the launch of DeWalt's first portable electric power tool range in 1992, which was rapidly expanded to include new products across the mid-'90s. It took until 2010 for the brand to launch its 12V Max line of interchangeable battery-powered electric tools, the same year its parent company merged with Stanley to form Stanley Black & Decker. It remains under the ownership of this merged company today.\n\nIn addition to owning DeWalt, Stanley Black & Decker also owns a range of other tool brands. One of the biggest is Craftsman, which first launched in 1927. It was originally created by Sears as an in-house tool brand, and by 1929, it had introduced its first electric power tools. Its lawnmower range wasn't far behind, hitting the Sears catalog in 1934, although riding mowers were not introduced until 1953. Other outdoor tools like the WeedWacker played a key part in broadening its appeal throughout the middle of the century, with Craftsman selling over a million WeedWackers by 1978. Stanley Black & Decker acquired Craftsman in 2017 as one of several additions to its stable of brands that year. The same company also purchased the Irwin brand in 2017, which is even older than DeWalt or Craftsman, having been founded in 1885. Lenox was also acquired by Stanley Black & Decker the same year. In addition, automotive tool brand Mac Tools is also under the same corporate umbrella, and unlike many of its rivals, it still makes some of its tools in America.\n\nThe first Ridgid product, a heavy-duty pipe wrench, left the factory in 1923. The company was founded in Elyria, Ohio, and made a variety of tools, including pipe cutters and threading machines, in its early years. In 1966, it was acquired by Emerson Electric, with the brand remaining under the same ownership today. However, the orange Ridgid power tools you might recognize from Home Depot are actually licensed by the Chinese toolmaking giant TTI, and are made in various locations around the world. Ridgid is just one of more than a dozen tool and appliance brands that TTI owns or licenses. It also owns Stiletto, Hart, Imperial Blades, and Empire Level, alongside previously mentioned major brands such as Milwaukee and Ryobi. That makes TTI arguably one of the most influential toolmaking corporations in the American market, even if there's a good chance that many of their most loyal customers might not recognize the TTI brand itself.\n\nIt's safe to assume that the vast majority of people couldn't point to Liechtenstein on a map. It is both one of the smallest countries in the world and a very wealthy one. The median salary in Liechtenstein is around $8,700 per month, according to 2024 data (equivalent to around $104,400 annually). This tiny, prosperous nation is also the birthplace of Hilti tools, which was founded by Eugen and Martin Hilti in 1941. The brand's first power-actuated nailer was launched in 1953, but was fundamentally redesigned in 1957 to make it safer to use. This redesigned tool would turn out to be Hilti's first hit product, and the company quickly expanded to overseas markets to capitalize on its popularity. Despite expanding its tool range and launching in a wide variety of markets over the decades, at its core, Hilti remains a family-run business today. In the last decade, the brand has completed several acquisitions in Europe to expand its business into everything from fire suppression systems to cable manufacturing. Still, its power tool lineup continues to be the most recognizable part of its range.\n\nGerman power tool manufacturer Stihl is another brand that has remained independent throughout its history. It's still owned by the Stihl family, with family members currently splitting ownership of the firm. Stihl has been in business since 1926, and is probably best known for its chainsaw range. It developed the first automatic bar and chain oiling system, a unique centrifugal clutch, and a tool-free chain adjuster, among many other innovations. Today, the company offers a lot more than just chainsaws. Alongside its conventional range of outdoor-focused power tools, it also offers a range of Kombi attachments that can be used interchangeably with a single power head. While certain other tool brands have moved away from manufacturing gas-powered tools and transitioned to an all-electric range, Stihl still offers a comprehensive range of both gas and electric tools. Many of its American-market products are also made in America at the brand's facility in Virginia Beach, VA.\n\nA German brand with a century of history, Festool was originally formed as Fezer & Stoll in 1925. In its fledgling days, it primarily made saws of various kinds, with its SB126 circular saw being among its earliest successes. During the '30s, the company would expand its range to include more tools and first use the Festo name. After the Second World War, the toolmaker got a significant boost as new tools were needed to help rebuild Germany's tattered infrastructure. As well as continuing to sell its core line of tools, Festo continued the development of new ones, with the Rutscher sander being one of its most notable products. In the late '70s, Festo continued its run of innovation with the launch of the Rotex sander. By 1992, its owners had decided that it was time for the brand to receive a marketing makeover, and that included a slightly different name: Festo Tooltechnic. The name didn't last long, and in 2000, it was renamed Festool. A further reshuffle saw Festool become a subsidiary brand of TTS Tooltechnic Systems, alongside its parent company's recent acquisitions, SawStop and Shaper. Throughout the name changes, TTS/Festool/Festo has remained owned by the same family, and is still headquartered in the same region of Germany in which it was founded a century ago.",

      "text": "Who Makes Kobalt Power Tools, And Are They Any Good?\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nIn the world of power tools, there are so many options available on the market it can make one's head spin. From affordable brands to the most elite, top-tier offerings, choosing the right company can be tricky. Kobalt tools are a reliable and trusted power tool brand from Lowe's and what most would consider a mid to high-range cordless power tool option with some affordable offerings.\nHowever, price isn't everything, and this is especially true when it comes to big-ticket purchases like power tools. With a wide roster of different tools, the question of whether Kobalt is a good power tool brand requires a close examination of the competition. When most people consider the quality of a power tool, they often ask pertinent questions, like where it was manufactured and how the performance compares to similar products in its price range.\nWhile Kobalt tools are not the highest-end power tools that you can purchase, it is a reliable mid-range option that's bolstered by its status as an official option at Lowe's, which offers fairly flexible return policies if the product is damaged or malfunctions in any way.\nWho owns Kobalt tools?\nThe answer to who owns and makes Kobalt tools is surprisingly more complex than one would think. Founded in 1998 via a partnership between Lowe's and J.H. Williams Tool Group, the company started so that the home improvement company could compete with Sears and The Home Depot in the tool market. J.H. Williams is better known for creating reliable hand tools since the 1880s.\nIn 1882, James Williams and Mathew Diamond founded Williams & Diamond in Flushing Queens. The company would later go on to change its name to J.H. Williams and would mass-produce some of the country's first drop-forged hand tools. This would eventually lead to the partnership with Lowe's over 100 years later, which would go on to produce Kobalt tools.\nHowever, having ownership over the brand and making the tools are two different things. From the start, Lowes worked with overseas organizations to help manufacture parts for its tools, including countries like China and Taiwan. While some of the tools may be assembled in the United States, it's currently unclear which tools are. Instead, a variety of different manufacturers help bring Kobalt tools to market.\nWho makes Kobalt tools, and where are they made?\nFrom 2003 to 2011, Kobalt Tools were manufactured mainly by the Danaher Corporation, the same company that manufactures tools for Craftsman, Lufkin, and Belzer. However, in 2011, Lowe's changed this and started working with a variety of manufacturers, leading different companies to play a part in Kobalt tool manufacturing.\nAt one point, the Las Vegas, Nevada-based JS Products, a company that produces hand tools for STEELMAN and other products for DeWalt, produced hand tools for Kobalt, but today, many of their hand tools, like screwdrivers, are produced by Great Neck. Kobalt power tools are mainly manufactured outside of the United States by Chervon, the same company that also produces products for popular tool brands like EGO, Flex, and Skil. The company also used to manufacture tools for Craftsman, but that brand was purchased by Stanley Black & Decker in 2017. Notably, Black & Decker is a company that puts a greater emphasis on having tools manufactured in the United States.\nChervon is a global company with factories located mainly in China and Germany and makes a wide range of different power tools, from cordless drivers, drills, and saws, to landscaping equipment like chainsaws and hedge trimmers. Flex, a German-based tool company founded in 1922, joined Chervon in 2013 to bolster its manufacturing capabilities.\nAre Kobalt tools good?\nKobalt tools are a mid to high-range option that has innovated mainly on its 24V Max model for cordless handheld power tools. Affordable and generally reliable, they are a slight step above other store brands like The Home Depot's Ryobi tools or Walmart's HART line. At fairly similar price points, Kobalt tools offer a more powerful 24V battery on their cordless drill/driver, compared to Ryobi's 18V and HART's 20V.\nThe battery on the Kobalt enables it to exert more as well, as the cordless drill achieves 2000 in-lb of torque and 3800 IPM, which exceeds competitors. Notably, Ryobi and HART tools have 515 and 550 in-lbs. of torque, respectively. Other tools in the Kobalt line, however, have received lower reviews, even in their 24V Max line. Specifically, their cordless polisher and sander received middling reviews, with some complaining about power, in addition to some of their larger saw models also receiving average reviews online.\nKobalt tools price comparison\nWhile larger table power tools will run a similar cost to Ryobi and HART, the 24V Max line of cordless handheld tools will be a bit more expensive and more similar in cost to higher-end brands like Milwaukee and DeWalt. For instance, the Kobalt XTR 24V Max 1/2-in. cordless drill costs $169 at Lowe's, with the Milwaukee M18 Fuel 18V 1/2-in. cordless drill selling for $189 at The Home Depot and DeWalt 20V Max XR 1/2-in driver costing $274 at Lowe's.\nCompared to more affordable drills, like Ryobi ONE 18V, which can be purchased for only $77.32 on Amazon, users will pay extra for the premium battery. Of the complaints about Kobalt tools, users have said that the battery makes them bulky or awkward to use. As mentioned previously, some of their larger pieces of equipment have also received some average reviews from users.\nUltimately, Kobalt tools are a slight step above the mid-range tools found online. While they are a bit better than other home improvement store brands for their cordless handheld line, they have received mixed results for larger power tools. Kobalt tools are fairly comparable to other big box brands, and their new battery technology is a cut above the rest regarding hand-held power tools."

      "text": "10 Of The Most Useful Stihl Kombi Attachments\nStihl makes many of its tools in the U.S., with its other factories dotted across the world, from the Philippines to Brazil. The brand is best known in the U.S. and abroad for its professional tools, in particular its chainsaws. However, the company also makes a wide range of other tools, including many that might be particularly useful for keen home landscapers.\nBuyers looking to stock up on multiple Stihl tools might want to consider the brand's Kombi system, which allows users to swap multiple attachments between the same power head. The brand offers a broad range of attachments that cover most common home landscaping needs, from trimming grass to blowing leaves from pathways and, unsurprisingly, a pruning chainsaw. Stihl's lineup is always changing, but for now, we think these 10 top picks are among the most useful of the bunch for home landscapers looking to whip their yards into shape.\nStihl BG-KM Blower\nOne of the most reliable ways to get an idea of how useful any tool is going to be is to see what buyers who actually purchased the tool have to say about it. Buyers of Stihl's leaf blower range are largely positive about it, with some of the most common complaints reserved for the brand's gas-powered range. That extra reassurance from existing owners will no doubt be welcome for many buyers, since the brand's tools aren't an insignificant investment. However, the Kombi-compatible BG-KM Blower is one of the cheaper attachments in the range, with a retail price of $149.99.\nIts exact specs vary depending on the Kombi power head that it's used with, but Stihl advises that it should offer a peak air speed of anywhere between 121 and 157 mph. That's a little short of the most powerful electric leaf blowers on the market, but it's still enough to deal with all but the most stubborn piles of debris. Since it only weighs 4 pounds, it should remain comfortable to carry around for longer periods, too.\nStihl FCS-KM Straight Lawn Edger\nMany of Stihl's tools are appealing because they're capable but straightforward, and the FCS-KM Straight Lawn Edger is no different. It retails for $199.99 and is designed to make edging a lawn as painless a task as possible, with an open guard that stops debris from clogging up the blade's path. Like all Kombi attachments, it can be used with all compatible Stihl Kombi power heads. However, Stihl does not advertise it as being universal-attachment capable, so it's not advisable to use it with power heads from other brands.\nThe Stihl Edger might not be the cheapest tool in its class, but it's comparably priced to similar tools from other top-rated brands like DeWalt. Like all the attachments here, the most cost-effective way of switching to the Kombi ecosystem is to buy multiple attachments with a single power head. If you're considering buying an individual tool and don't already have a Kombi power head, you'll need to buy one separately. Power heads vary in price between models, but at a minimum, you'll be adding several hundred dollars to your final bill.\nStihl BF-KM Mini Cultivator\nThere are some yard work tasks that always end up being more enjoyable than others. Even if you're otherwise a keen home landscaper and enjoy most other tasks, it's likely that soil preparation ranks towards the bottom of your preference list. Nonetheless, if a flower bed needs cultivating, or you're looking to spruce up a previously forgotten corner of your yard, you might not have much choice. The Stihl BF-KM Mini Cultivator is a reliable way to make soil preparation less of a chore, with dual tines and a durable guard to protect you from debris.\nIt retails for $209.99, and can be bought both from Stihl's website and from select national retailers like Ace Hardware. When paired with other attachments such as the brand's brushcutter, it should make creating and maintaining new flower beds or planting areas much less strenuous than using old-school manual tools. Since the tool's gearbox is sealed, there's no need to worry about lubricating the tool either, with the only necessary maintenance being replacing the tines when they wear out.\nStihl FSS-KM String Trimmer\nIn our ranking of every major grass trimmer brand, we placed Stihl at the number one spot. The brand scored highly for its wide range of products targeting both professionals seeking the most capable tools and home landscapers looking for a balance of price and power. The FSS-KM String Trimmer falls into the latter category, being less powerful than the brand's toughest trimmers but also notably more affordable, with a retail price of $119.99. That's low enough to make it one of the cheapest priced Kombi attachments on the market. Yet, if you've got awkwardly shaped corners in your yard that a mower struggles to reach, it might just be one of the most useful.\nThe trimmer offers a 17.7-inch cutting swath, but it only weighs 6 pounds. That makes it not only capable of slicing through larger patches of overgrowth in one go, but also light enough to remain comfortable to use for long periods. The only downside is that some potential buyers have noted on Stihl's website that the trimmer isn't available at all Stihl authorized outlets, so it's worth checking the stock of your retailer of choice online before you go.\nStihl FS-KM Brushcutter\nEven if you already have a string trimmer, a brushcutter might be a useful addition to your arsenal of tools. A brushcutter can tackle tougher, more overgrown areas of a yard, and comes in particularly useful if you're trying to clear a large area quickly. For home landscapers with pristine, perfectly manicured yards, it won't be necessary, but if you're looking to overhaul an overgrown yard, it may well be worth the investment. Stihl's Kombi-compatible version of the tool is called the FS-KM Brushcutter, and it costs under $120.\nIt packs a blade with four cutting teeth that can be replaced as needed if they wear out. For most home landscapers, though, even those who have particularly overgrown yards, it won't get used often enough to wear out. It might be one of the less commonly used tools here, at least for most buyers, but as anyone who's cleared even a small overgrown patch of yard with manual tools will know, it can be back-breaking work. Having a brushcutter to slice through overgrowth, even if it's just occasionally, is arguably worth shelling out for.\nStihl KW-KM PowerSweep\nIt might be one of the priciest Kombi attachments, at a retail price of over $350, but the Stihl KW-KM PowerSweep may be a worthwhile purchase for some home landscapers. It's designed to remove debris of all kinds from pathways without scratching the paving surface, and can tackle small stones and water as well as the usual mud and mulch. Stihl says it can also be used to tackle light snowfall, removing it from driveways and paths without the need to bring out the shovel.\nIt's also capable of removing sand from turf, and can be put to work cleaning liquid spills if necessary. It's a versatile tool, then, even if it is still a pricey one. If you're knee-deep in Stihl tools and want to add another attachment to your arsenal, it's well worth considering, but if you're new to the brand and looking for the essentials only, it can probably be left off your shopping list for now.\nStihl HT-KM Pole Pruner\nDespite being well-known as a chainsaw brand, Stihl didn't fare too well overall in our ranking of the best pole saw brands on the market. It was beaten by rivals, including Makita, Milwaukee, and DeWalt, and lost points because of its limited availability in leading hardware stores compared to the top-rated brands. However, if you're already a Stihl fan, or already shop somewhere where the brand's products are sold, that won't matter.\nWhat will matter is that the brand's HT-KM Pole Pruner offers all the same capability as its other saw products, and it's compatible with the Kombi power head system. It retails for between $199 and $249, depending on whether you prefer a 12-inch blade or a 10-inch blade. Useful features include a side-access chain tensioner and an Oilomatic chain, the latter being a name that should be familiar to owners of the brand's chainsaws. It's designed to prioritize the lubrication of high-wear areas of the chain, with the intention of giving it a longer life than other, rival saws.\nStihl KB-KM Bristle Brush\nAlongside the PowerSweep, another Stihl tool designed to keep pathways clear is the KB-KM Bristle Brush. It features nylon bristles and spins rapidly to disperse dirt and debris much faster than a manual broom could ever hope to. The sweeping head can cover up to 24 inches of pathway at once, making it a useful companion for clearing large stretches in a hurry. It can also clean artificial lawns, although Stihl notes that using it on a real lawn will damage the grass.\nMuch like the PowerSweep, the Bristle Brush isn't a cheap attachment, retailing for over $300. That's an order of magnitude pricier than a simple manual brush, and also far pricier than Ryobi's similar Expand-It sweeper attachment. Whether it's worth the money is down to personal preference, but if you're willing to spend the cash and are already committed to the Stihl Kombi ecosystem, the bristle brush should come in handy all year round.\nStihl RG-KM Reciprocator\nPowering through foliage with a brushcutter might be satisfying, but it will leave behind a trail of debris. You might even end up covered in some of that debris, but for areas where precision is needed more than pure power, it might be worth considering the Stihl RG-KM Reciprocator instead. It allows for precise cutting with minimal debris spray, making it a good option for areas that need neat edges but feature tougher foliage than a trimmer would effectively be able to tackle.\nThe edges of ponds, areas near trees, or banks near paths are just a few areas that might be easier to keep neat with the reciprocator, although its price tag means it will only be a worthwhile purchase for the most dedicated landscapers. At a retail price of $429.99, the reciprocator is the priciest attachment here, and despite it being a potentially very useful addition to many home landscapers' collections, it's too pricey to be a worthwhile purchase for many.\nStihl HL-KM 145 Degree Adjustable Hedge Trimmer\nA wide variety of brands offer hedge trimmers, from big-name, professional-grade tools down to entry-level trimmers that are best suited to occasional users. The HL-KM 145 Degree Adjustable Hedge Trimmer will suit even the most demanding home landscapers, with its adjustable head making it a more versatile option than the brand's Kombi-compatible fixed hedge trimmer. Trimming hedges of all shapes and sizes is easier with an adjustable hedge trimmer, and the Stihl trimmer is particularly light too, so it's less strenuous to use over longer periods.\nThe 20-inch trimmer retails for more than $280, and a 24-inch trimmer is listed as out of stock on the Stihl USA website. Add in the price of a Kombi power head, and this isn't a cheap tool \u2014 but then again, none of Stihl's tools are. Buyers pay for the capability and quality associated with the name. With the Kombi attachments, they also pay for the added versatility that comes with having a wide variety of attachments at their disposal."

      "text": "Where Are Makita's Power Tools Made, And Who Owns The Company Today?\nThere are a lot of major power tool brands lining the shelves of our local hardware stores, but few have so long and storied a history as Makita. The company is over 100 years old, dating all the way back to 1915 when it was founded by Masoburo Makita as an electric motor sales and repair company based in Nagoya City. It wasn't until 1958 that Makita turned toward power tools, becoming the first manufacturer in Japan to produce a portable electric planer. It was this successful launch that led the company to focus its attention on tool production until it eventually became one of the most well-known power tool manufacturers in the world, with a distribution network that now spans over 40 countries across the globe.\nA lot can change in a century, however, and it isn't uncommon for brands to evolve, relocate, and even change ownership over decades. Power tool brands are no exception. With that in mind, fans of Makita's products might be curious to learn a bit more about how the company operates today. They may want to know a bit more about where the Makita power tools that we find in stores are being manufactured and who currently owns the company.\nWhere are Makita's power tools made today?\nMakita's power tools are currently manufactured in plants located in eight different countries: Japan, China, Romania, Thailand, the United Kingdom, Brazil, the United States, and Germany.\nThe company has branch offices in 21 cities in Japan and 129 sales offices, but it's the Okazaki Mother Plant that has been the single biggest source of domestic manufacturing for the company since it was established in 1970. In fact, it continues to be Makita's biggest plant in Japan, despite the fact that it now only accounts for roughly 10% of the company's global product manufacturing. Its production focus has largely shifted toward advanced robotics, precision manufacturing, research, and development. So, while only a small portion of Makita's tools are physically made and assembled in Okazaki, it's safe to say that a large portion of Makita's designs and proprietary technologies were conceived here.\nThat said, the majority of Makita's products that are built today (approximately 60%) are made in the Jiangsu Mother Plant in China, which has been in operation since 1995. This facility is primarily focused on efficient mass production of parts, so you'll likely find that a large portion of Makita's products are made here and that even those that are assembled at other plants include components that were first prepared in this facility.\nThe other ~30% of production takes place in the other countries listed above. The facility in Hamburg, Germany, specializes in making outdoor power equipment, but most of the other facilities aren't targeted at a specific type of product. Those in the U.S., U.K., Brazil, Thailand, and Romania are all dedicated to general production for local markets. This helps Makita minimize its transportation and import costs.\nWho currently owns Makita power tools?\nA lot of power tool manufacturers are owned by parent companies. Ryobi and Milwaukee are both owned by Techtronic Industries, DeWalt and Craftsman are owned by Stanley Black and Decker, and Dremel is owned by Bosch. But you might be surprised to learn that Makita is one of the few companies that is not part of a larger corporate umbrella.\nThe company's original name was Makita Electric Works, Inc., back when it was privately owned, but the trade name was officially changed to Makita Electric Works, Ltd. in May 1962, just three months before the company went public and was listed in the second section of the Nagoya Stock Exchange. In 1968, it was also listed in the second section of the Tokyo and Osaka Stock Exchanges and then bumped up to the first section in all three in 1970. Several subsidiary entities have popped up in the years since. Makita U.S.A. Inc. was established in the U.S. in 1970, Makita S.A. was established in France in 1971, and Makita Electric (U.K.) Ltd. was established in 1972, as well as other corporate entities in Australia, the Netherlands, Canada, Germany and dozens of other countries, but all of these are owned by Makita. The company once again changed its name to Makita Corporation in 1991, but has remained and continues to remain a publicly traded entity."

      "text": "Who Owns Mac Tools & Where Are Its Products Made?\nLooking over the numerous tool brands currently on the market, the bulk of them are quite versatile. The likes of DeWalt and Milwaukee have built their reputations on having the power and hand tools to tackle virtually any job. Meanwhile, others boast dense catalogues that shift the focus onto one discipline.\nMac Tools is one such brand, having focused on specifically automotive labor tools and gadgets throughout its history. As a result, it has earned its place among the brands that mechanics and auto shop owners love to have around \u2013 even if they haven't delved much into the company itself. Mac Tools started with its founding all the way back in 1938, when it was known as the Mechanics Tool and Forge Company. Mac Tools was acquired by Stanley Black and Decker in 1980, and it has remained under that parent company's umbrella for over four decades. Today, the company makes its products in a variety of locations.\nMac Tools' products are made in multiple locations\nAs a brand born in the United States, it's no surprise that Mac Tools endures as one of the few tool brands that still make tools in the US, with manufacturing plants in Dallas, Texas and Georgetown, Ohio. If you're curious if your product was made at one of the US plants, just check the Mac Tools website. There, you can utilize the \"Made in America\" filter to show you only items manufactured in the US.\nWith that said, Mac Tools is a worldwide brand, despite its history in the country and its parent company, Stanley Black and Decker, having a physical presence in 20 states. They've crossed oceans to reach hardware store shelves, with some tools being made in the likes of China and Japan. If you're curious about where your Mac Tools were made, it's not uncommon for the country of origin to be stamped somewhere on the tool itself or for the packaging to list the country of origin.\nMac Tools sells its wares around the world, too\nIn becoming a massive name in the automotive tool world, Mac Tools has undergone significant expansion and began franchising locations in 2011. There are currently over 700 Mac Tools franchise locations in operation in the United States alone. With that said, much like its manufacturing, Mac Tools' franchise expansion hasn't been limited to the US.\nIn addition to locations in Canada, Mac Tools has a heavy presence in Japan, which makes sense considering the brand has been a manufacturing fixture there for some time. Meanwhile, in Europe \u2014 the home of tool brands that rival Makita and other American staples \u2014 Mac Tools has expanded into the likes of England and Northern Ireland. This brings the franchise total to around 1,000. Considering how widespread Mac Tools products have become since franchising began in 2011, it stands to reason that it will become more common in other regions sooner rather than later.\nMac Tools is already an automotive favorite, but it's not resting on its laurels. The brand \u2014 and the folks behind it at Stanley Black and Decker \u2014 will likely continue to grow the label in terms of manufacturing and distribution well into the future."

      "text": "The Ryobi Timeline: A Closer Look At The History Of Ryobi Tools\nFor eight decades, the Ryobi brand has produced countless innovations across industries. Despite its humble Japanese origins, it's no wonder that it is now a global household name in more ways than one. Although not necessarily regarded to be as durable as other brands, Ryobi power tools have been known for mostly favorable reviews. Because of their performance and price range, Ryobi power tools are loved by pros and novices alike.\nFrom its cordless drills to soldering pens to air compressors, Ryobi offers products that generally work for straightforward, everyday tasks. Whether you are working on vehicles, kitchen remodeling, or landscaping, there's likely a Ryobi power tool that will help with the job.\nHowever, Ryobi didn't actually start out selling power tools. Here's a look at its history, various owners, and where it might be headed in the years to come.\nThe origins of Ryobi (1940s)\nIn September 1943, the manager of Mitsubishi Electric's Fukuyama Works in Hiroshima, Japan, proposed the possibility of die casting to Yutaka Urakami. At the time, Yutaka was operating a small trading company and knew nothing about it. However, within a week of this conversation, Yutaka rose to the challenge.\nDie casting, according to Ryobi, \"is a metal casting process that involves feeding molten nonferrous alloys into dies under high pressure and at high speed to rapidly create molded products.\" In December 1943, Ryobi, then called \"Ryobi Seisakusho Co., Ltd.\" was established in Hiroshima, Japan. After two months, Ryobi held an opening ceremony for the company, wherein it began manufacturing these products in a retro-fitted soy sauce warehouse and selling them.\nHere, Ryobi was able to mass produce thin, complex products, which created smooth casting surfaces that required less machining after being molded.\nAmong its most popular products, were Ryobi-made automobile industry components. Some of its examples of die casts for cars include cylinder blocks, transmission cases, and shock towers. Ryobi claims that the die casts it produce contribute to the overall weight reduction of vehicles, which is a key aspect that helps improve overall fuel efficiency. After a decade of creating metal die cast products, Ryobi began manufacturing plastic die cast products in 1954.\nRyobi enters the power tools market (1970s)\nIn 1961, Ryobi became a publicly traded company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. That same year, it also began manufacturing offset printing presses and later merged with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Machinery Systems, Ltd. It became RYOBI MHI Graphic Technology Ltd. in 2014. Afterward, it expanded its operations across a variety of industries, such as builder's hardware, fishing tackles, and an insurance agency. To make its name simpler and easier to remember, Ryobi Seisakusho was renamed to Ryobi Limited.\nIn 1968, Ryobi unlocked one category that helped make it a household name worldwide: power tools. From budget-friendly to expensive products made for heavy-duty work, Ryobi amassed a huge portfolio of power tools for both casual and professional users. In 1996, Ryobi launched the cordless lithium-ion technology, the RYOBI 18V ONE+ System, which is still being used until today and features over 280 innovative compatible products.\nUnfortunately, as Japan experienced economic decline in the 1990s, the power tools business came under fire. To keep the company afloat, Ryobi announced its Sound Management Plan, a policy that helped reform unprofitable businesses and focus its resources on areas of strength. To do this, Ryobi planned to reduce its workforce, axe its golfing goods, and fishing tackle businesses, as well as sell most of its overseas power tool business.\nRyobi's changing ownership\nBy 2018, Ryobi decided to execute a company split, which established the Kyocera Corporation, a new company specifically aimed at its power tools business in Japan, Asia, and Africa. Aside from transferring 80% of its shares, Ryobi also turned over all operations related to it, including a manufacturing plant in China and 48 sales office in Japan.\nIn North America, Techtronic Industries Co., Ltd. (TTI), a Hong Kong-based company, has handled the manufacturing and distribution of Ryobi products since August 2000. By 2002, TTI acquired Ryobi's power tools business in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand as well. TTI's brand portfolio also includes other powerhouse brands like Milwaukee, AEG, Empire, Hoover and more. In 2022, TTI claimed to have generated $13.3 billion in annual sales across its portfolio.\nIn 2023, Home Depot named TTI's two brands, Milwaukee Tool and Ryobi, as Partner of the Year under three different categories. In a press release, it also shares that Ryobi Outdoor Power Equipment was one of the finalists of the 2023 Innovation Award. It was the first time in the award's history that a supplier has won three Partner of the Year awards in a single year.\nThe state of Ryobi power tools today\nIn 2023, Yipit Data claims that Ryobi has led the outdoor power equipment industry with a 20% market share for the past two years. In the United States, Yipit Data also notes that Ryobi's power tool brand share for Home Depot made up 35% of its total sales in Q4 2022.\nWith this, it's no wonder that the World Tool Awards hailed the Ryobi cordless nailer R15GN18 as the winner of its Premium class of Cordless Nailers category in 2022. A year later, Ryobi also snagged 9 wins at the 2023 Pro Tool Innovation Awards, including cordless power tools: the Ryobi 18V ONE+ 1800W Power Station RYi818BG for inverters over 1000w and the 18V ONE+ HP Mud Mixer PBLMM01B mixer.\nAnd, it looks like Ryobi has no intention of slowing down. In 2023 alone, Ryobi introduced 17 new products to its line up, which include compact cutting tools, cordless blowers, and hedge trimmers. It also unveiled the new Ryobi 80V Power Source, which works in tandem with existing Ryobi 80V batteries and can provide up to 1000 watts of power on the go."

      "text": "Who Owns Ridgid Tools And Where Are They Made?\nAs one of the better choices among the major power tools brands, Ridgid Tools is a staple of garages, workshops, and job sites everywhere. Folks from various trades have looked to the brand for high quality power and hand tools, allowing it to become such a well-established name over the years. Of course, all of this success didn't occur overnight. Ridgid has had a presence on the tool scene for over 100 years, finding its start in 1923 with the creation of the modern pipe wrench. Back then, the company was led and owned by its founder, Carl Ingwer Sr.\nFast forward a century, and to no surprise, the ownership structure of Ridgid looks a bit different than it did during the 1920s. Ingwer Sr. has since passed away, and the tenured tool manufacturer is now led by Craig Sumner, who took on the position of president in 2021. As far as Ridgid's parent company, that title has belonged to Emerson Electric since 1966. Emerson has also taken ownership of the likes of Klauke and Greenlee, expanding its reach into different sectors of the labor force.\nRidgid tools are made all over the world\nAt its core, Ridgid Tools is an American company. Back when it was established in 1923, it called Elyria, Ohio, home, and just past its 100th birthday, it still holds a place there. Its headquarters there has undertaken everything from tool manufacturing to training to corporate matters since the building opened its doors in 1943. At the same time, Ridgid could've never reached the heights it has without some measure of expansion. For its pipe wrenches in particular, the Erie, Pennsylvania Urick Foundry is where the iron wrench handles are created. Yet, the facts of Ridgid's manufacturing don't end here.\nAs anyone who has spent any time in the tool aisle knows, there's far more to Ridgid than its iconic pipe wrench. The brand has no shortage of power tools to offer, too \u2014 which you should register once you get them \u2014 and this expanded catalog means moving to other parts of the world. Some Ridgid tools are made by the Hong Kong, China-based Techtronic Industries, the company behind a host of other well-known power tool brands like Milwaukee and Ryobi. TTI is responsible for the AEG line of tools, which are branded as Ridgid, specifically within the United States.\nHow are Ridgid and Home Depot related?\nHome Depot is a one-stop shop for all things carpentry, plumbing, DIY, and more, with tools and supplies galore. As such, the massive hardware chain features a wide selection of power tools from a range of brands. Still, even though there are several big-name brands on display at each store, Ridgid Tools, in particular, has become synonymous with Home Depot. This, coupled with the two brands sharing an orange color scheme, creates the illusion that Home Depot either owns or oversees the manufacturing of Ridgid tools. As established, this is not at all the case.\nSo, what exactly is the working relationship between these two entities? While not owned by Home Depot, Ridgid is a brand exclusive to the store and one of the top tools brands exclusive to one hardware store. Ridgid has been a staple of Home Depot since its massive launch at the store in 2003, with sale exclusivity being the extent of their relationship up to this point. Ridgid joins Ryobi and Milwaukee as Home Depot's three exclusive cordless power tool brands.\nThough Ridgid Tools might look like it's entirely Home Depot's responsibility, as it turns out, its distribution deal there is where their overlap begins and ends. Evidently, there's far more to the story when it comes to the manufacturing and ownership of Ridgid that lies beneath the surface."

      "text": "13 Popular Tool & Appliance Brands Owned By China's Techtronic Industries (TTI)\nTechtonic Industries, or TTI, is a name that plenty of tool users will be familiar with. Consumers won't readily see these three letters on the power tool or appliance box they've just taken home, but rest assured, the brand behind the abbreviation is standing behind the name you know and love in many instances. Techtronic Industries is a Chinese/Hong Kong-based conglomerate entity that owns and manufactures a surprisingly large range of major tool brands and appliance offerings.\nThe company got its start in 1985 and soon after began operating as a supplier, distributing power tools to U.S. brands. In 1988, the company's first manufacturing facility opened in Dongguan, China, and it became a publicly listed company in 1990 on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Perhaps the company's first major acquisition, TTI became the owner of Vax in 1999, and it's been a story of growth and expansion from there. The early 2000s were a time of immense change within TTI's halls, and numerous big-name brands that it still owns today were purchased at this time (interestingly enough, positioned between the major stock market meltdowns of the dot-com bubble and the housing market collapse). TTI has continued its growth into the present market, and there's a good chance that you use TTI products in your everyday life or DIY tasks on a routine basis. TTI owns and builds a number of store-exclusive products, as well as widespread brands that are sold in abundance. These are some of the most popular brands in the company's portfolio.\nMilwaukee\nMilwaukee is potentially TTI's most prominent brand name. Milwaukee equipment has a storied past, with a century of operation under its belt. The brand is a fixture on jobsites all around the world, and the easily recognizable red and black color scheme of Milwaukee gear makes it stand out in a big way. Acquired by TTI in 2004, Milwaukee has become a gigantic name in the world of power tools (as well as providing a range of hand tool offerings). Milwaukee gear is fast, powerful, and trusted by professionals and DIYers alike. On the financial side of things, Milwaukee's total revenue in 2024 was nearly $10 billion, making it a huge earner for TTI with no signs of slowing down.\nThe brand offers all sorts of equipment that can improve your workflow and life. Plenty of Milwaukee products can make things easier at home (like non-marring knee pads or level 1 insulated work gloves). Milwaukee even makes insulated lunch boxes and other accessory equipment like speaker systems to help support your efforts out and about. Heading into the future, Milwaukee has filed patents for new and exciting equipment like a line launcher, a log splitter, and a new robot lawn mower.\nHoover\nHoover is another classic brand that many tool users might not have known is owned by TTI. The vacuum innovator has been in business for over a century and, in that time, has frequently found itself at the forefront of cleaning solution innovation. Hoover is synonymous with suction tools, and in many places, people call vacuums Hoovers in much the same way a circular saw user might refer to the cutting tool as a Skilsaw.\nTTI announced the deal to acquire the Hoover brand in late 2006, paying $107 million for the company alongside an agreement to take on some existing obligations. Prior to its acquisition by TTI, Hoover had been owned by Whirlpool. Now it occupies a position within the conglomerate brand's TTI Floor Care North America division, and is headquartered in Charlotte. Hoover units have long been a key vacuuming resource for homeowners and renters, and modern tools within its catalog focus on cordless power as well as alternative cleaning implements that break the mold of the classic upright vacuum cleaner. These include spot cleaners, hand vacuums, and specialized hard floor cleaner tools, among others.\nRyobi\nRyobi is a brand that many know and love. The lime green power tool producer dabbles in virtually every sort of implement you might need for a home improvement project. The catalog is so deep that even haters of the brand can get behind numerous offerings. Ryobi is a toolmaker with an interesting and transformative history (beginning as a die casting outfit in 1943), and TTI plays an important role in that story. Starting at the turn of the century, TTI began acquiring components of the Ryobi brand. In August 2000, TTI took ownership of the American Ryobi power tools operation, and a year later, it added the European wing to its holdings. In March 2002, TTI purchased the Ryobi business interests in Australia and New Zealand for a price tag of 5.9 million AUD.\nThe Ryobi brand is an accessible option for renovators and trade professionals everywhere. The company has faced criticism from pros in the past, but there's no denying the blend of cost-effectiveness and performance chops that Ryobi gear brings to the table. A revenue of 293.31 billion JPY ($1.95 billion) in 2024 speaks volumes about the brand's staying power and value to users. Everything from crafting tools to heavy construction equipment can be found stamped in Ryobi lime, making it a brand to turn to for all manner of users.\nHart\nHart began its journey into the marketplace as a niche hand tool brand. The company made framing hammers designed and built for the people who rely on them the most. Hart innovated purpose-built head shapes and handle designs to make the framing hammer a better tool for framers. The inclusion of progressive angled faces and carefully balanced weight ratios made them more efficient and less fatiguing to use. Hart was established in 1983, and it didn't take long for the brand to expand its offerings. Other hand tools like axes, mauls, chisels, and mattocks joined the catalog, and the modern lineup also includes consumer power tools and outdoor equipment like chainsaws and lawnmowers.\nHart was acquired by TTI in 2007. Hart added crucial hand tool coverage to TTI's portfolio, bolstering an already significant power tool and accessory presence in names like Milwaukee and Ryobi. In 2019, Hart partnered with Walmart to make it an exclusive line for the everything store. The Hart brand offers competitively priced options capable of getting the job done on a budget. Some of the design choices are a little clunky or not fully realized, but this is to be expected in a tool brand focusing on price reductions while keeping power and performance front and center.\nStiletto\nStiletto is a hand tool brand that's among the legendary names in the American trades. The hammer maker got its start during the California Gold Rush, launching as the in-house tool brand for Baker, Hamilton & Pacific Co. in 1849. The brand has made pristine striking tools and other hand tool equipment ever since, delivering durable, quality gear to some of the most labor-intensive industries in existence. Today, Stiletto's primary claim to fame comes from the fact that the manufacturer is perhaps the preeminent builder of titanium hammers, axes, and prybars. Stiletto's titanium designs offer a nearly 50% reduction in the weight of a tool while providing an unchanged striking or pulling force. Putting that into context, a framer can essentially perform almost twice the amount of work with a titanium tool in their hand compared to a steel alternative while expending the same amount of energy. Since the workday doesn't become twice as long when you upgrade tools, the practical result is a hammer user who is far less physically spent at the end of a long day filled with driving nails.\nTTI acquired Stiletto in 2007, although the arrangement technically places Stiletto as a part of the Milwaukee tool company rather than a direct subsidiary of TTI itself. It's worth noting that this distinction isn't made on TTI's branding website, however. Stiletto is a brand that will set you back more than a few bucks, but users often report that they will keep and use their hammers and other Stiletto gear for decades.\nDirt Devil\nAnother big name in the cleaning world, TTI acquired Dirt Devil and its parent company, Royal Appliance, in 2002. The vacuum company was already a significant player in the North American marketplace, and TTI opted to roll it into its TTI Floor Care North America subsidiary. Headquartered alongside other vacuum and household appliance names under the TTI banner in Charlotte, Dirt Devil has continued to thrive as a major player within the TTI portfolio.\nDirt Devil vacuums include both standing, classic vacuum cleaner designs and numerous alternative builds. These feature as handheld solutions, spot cleaners, and scrubbers that offer portability and maneuverable cleaning power. The company also makes air purifiers and heavy-duty carpet cleaning tools to round out the floor cleaning and environmental improvement capabilities of the home. Combined with its other big-name holdings, Dirt Devil is an acquisition that TTI brass is likely very happy with all these years later.\nRidgid\nRidgid is an interesting case. Unlike most of TTI's holdings, Ridgid is actually owned by Emerson Electric, but the brand is licensed to TTI, and production of Ridgid equipment is something of a crossover rebranding. TTI makes both Ridgid and AEG equipment, branding the tools with one badge (Ridgid) in the United States and the other (AEG) in Europe. Ridgid is a company with over a century of history. It was founded in Ohio, where it maintains a presence to this day, and first created iron wrench handles to support the brand's iconic pipe wrenches in Erie, Pennsylvania.\nTTI is responsible, particularly, for Ridgid's cordless power tools. The licensing agreement came into effect in 2003, and TTI has built the brand's power tools ever since. Even so, Emerson maintains actual ownership over the company (since purchasing it in 1966) and builds its other tool offerings in-house rather than through a licensing arrangement. It's also worth noting that the orange skin adorning Ridgid tools is a clear-cut symbol of the brand behind the example's manufacturing. Orange Ridgid gear was produced by TTI, while red alternatives come from its parent company, Emerson.\nAEG\nThe other side of TTI's Ridgid coin, AEG, is a brand that TTI bought in 2005. AEG was founded as DEG in 1883 but changed its moniker in 1887 to Allgemeine Elektricit\u00e4ts-Gesellschaft (General Electric Company). In 1898, the brand delivered the first transportable drilling machines to the market, and the landscape of power tools and heavy workplace demands was forever altered. The company was also an early player in the development of Germany's use of the assembly line.\nAhead of TTI's acquisition, AEG had been trending toward use primarily within the DIY marketplace. However, the change of ownership ushered in a number of new directions of focus, including an expansion beyond the brand's home region. In 2006, TTI introduced AEG products to the Middle East and South Africa, and sought to expand its presence in Eastern Europe, as well. New tools hit the market, and in 2009, the company's catalog was reimagined to include an orange colorway on all of its power tool solutions. The result is a streamlined crossover between TTI's production of orange-themed Ridgid tools and its AEG lineup.\nHomelite\nAn agreement to purchase Homelite from Deere & Co. Group was announced at the end of 2001. The next year, TTI took over the outdoor power tool brand in an effort to push its boundaries and introduce a new segment to the tool offerings held within the company's interests.\nHomelite produces string and hedge trimmers, chainsaws, and leaf blowers. Its products form a major segment of the outdoor power tool marketplace that homeowners everywhere rely on. The brand was founded in 1921 and originally served as an electricity production option for rural farmers who weren't yet covered by expanding electricity grids. Initially formed as the Home Electric Lighting Company, Homelite generators were instrumental in powering essential new technological developments in the agrarian countryside. Later, the brand's generators would serve a central role in keeping American troops switched on, so to speak, as they traversed the global battlefields of World War II.\nVax\nCleaning solutions have long been at the heart of the TTI mission. Early on in its journey, TTI acquired the Vax brand, bringing powered floorcare tools into its portfolio in 1999, before engaging with staples like Ryobi, Homelite, or Milwaukee. Vax isn't a brand that many Americans might be familiar with. The company was founded in Britain in 1977 and offered the first commercial carpet washing solution that homeowners could bring into their cleaning arsenal. The 3-in-1 machine was compact and potent, offering a stable starting point for a brand that would grow into a significant U.K. floor care business.\nModern Vax solutions include the classic carpet washing options, with spot cleaning tools and a stand-up model that's easy to use over a widespread area \u2014 such as an entire room or home. The brand also makes cordless vacuums and hard-floor cleaning solutions. Vax has continued to enjoy a significant status among British users, even with the Dyson craze coming into the picture later on. Vax isn't a big name in the American market, considering all the other competitive options to choose from, but its global presence is genuinely notable.\nOreck\nAnother vacuum brand, Oreck rounds out the primary cleaning segment of the TTI portfolio. Oreck makes all manner of industrial and consumer floor cleaning tools, as well as air purifiers and accessory cleaning solutions and replacement products (belts, filters, vacuum bags, and the like). Oreck offers cordless and portable vacuum tools, too, placing it in the same conversation as both industrial cleaning brands and consumer options all at once.\nTTI brought Oreck into its holdings in 2013, and specifically notes that the company holds a special place in the hearts of many American users. Oreck was founded in 1963 and quickly grew into what TTI refers to as \"one of America's most beloved vacuum brands, with a fiercely loyal base of customers.\" Oreck is one of TTI's most recent purchases, but it's certainly not one that marks a change of pace for the voracious conglomerate brand. This vacuum company is another that was folded into the TTI Floor Care North America umbrella, along with Hoover and Dirt Devil.\nImperial Blades\nImperial Blades is an American accessory manufacturer founded in 2008. The company lays claim to inventing the universal anchor in 2009, a design feature that has come to underpin multitool blade attachment across virtually the entire spectrum of brands (over 40 tool manufacturers utilize compatibility with the anchor design). The company also introduced titanium coatings to its multitool blades, marking a significant technological leap in 2010. Adding titanium into the mix helps keep the heat on the cutting surface lower, while naturally lubricating cuts to extend the life of the accessory and slow the effects of wear and tear on the teeth. Imperial Blades would also introduce titanium-coated carbide blades into its lineup in 2016, paving the way for additional cutting coverage in hard materials that go beyond just lumber.\nAfter a rapid succession of new innovations and tool accessory improvements, Imperial Blades was acquired by TTI in 2018. The purchase was made through TTI's Milwaukee brand, so the accessory builder is technically organized as part of Milwaukee rather than TTI directly. This is fitting since both businesses are based in Wisconsin, delivering a regional flavor and shared heritage that isn't typically found in corporate ownership changes.\nEmpire Level\nAnother acquisition that features a common regional heritage, in 2014, TTI acquired Empire Level through its Milwaukee subsidiary, bringing another Wisconsin-based tool manufacturer into the fold. Empire has been serving the construction industry since 1919, providing levels, squares, tape tools, and layout solutions. The modern product catalog also includes laser tools, precision measurement equipment such as calipers and measurement gauges, and even accessory equipment like safety tape to mark off areas and hazards.\nEmpire brings a core functionality component to the TTI brand catalog, and it's an area that often flies under the radar among users outside of the professional sphere. Even so, the company delivers on an essential segment of the construction and renovation industries. Empire isn't shy when it comes to innovation, either. Users can get hold of auto-calibrated, digital level tools as well as the classic vial options. The squares from Empire feature permanent marking and are exceedingly accurate, giving users a level of confidence that goes a step above."
