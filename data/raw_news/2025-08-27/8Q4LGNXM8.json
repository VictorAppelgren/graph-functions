  "title": "Sonos Is Clearing Out Its Move 2 Stock on Amazon, Our Top Pick for Portable Speakers",
  "description": "The Sonos Move 2 is among the best portable Bluetooth speakers for sound quality.",
  "content": "Getting a discount on Sonos products often amounts to winning the jackpot. Other than during major events like Prime Day or Black Friday, discounts are scarce. But this Labor Day, Amazon has everyone in surprise with an all-time low price for the Sonos Move 2 portable speaker.\n\nThe Sonos Move 2 has been redesigned internally and externally, and it delivers one of the best portable speaker experiences out there. At the current price of $349, down 22 percent from its regular $449 price, it\u2019s definitely something to consider if seriously great sound while mobile is something you need. You receive a surround sound audio experience either close to the speaker or a couple feet away.\n\nThanks to its sophisticated design, the Move 2 provides rich, clean bass driven by a precision-tuned mid-woofer and improved digital signal processing. The sound stays crisp and balanced at every volume level without distortion, so your music sounds just the way the artist intended it. Sonos has also built in automatic Trueplay tuning which adjusts the speaker\u2019s output to your environment using built-in mics. I.e., if you are sitting on a patio or room that has unique acoustics, the Move 2 will automatically adjust the sound to give you the best listening experience possible.\n\nAnother advantage of this speaker is its battery life of 24 hours on a single charge which is double that of the Move\u2019s original battery. To charge it, simply set the Move 2 on the built-in wireless charging base, redesigned for quicker and simpler placement with a smaller, detachable adapter. The speaker\u2019s IP56 rating protects it from dust, water spray, and even drops, so it\u2019s safe for outdoor activities or simply everyday use without worry.\n\nThe Sonos Move 2 supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 which means you can stream your music directly from your phone or laptop. You can also use Apple AirPlay 2 and voice assistants like Alexa or Sonos Voice Control to navigate your playlists hands-free. What\u2019s more, the speaker features touch controls on top for quick play, pause, volume adjustment, and skip options.\n\nDon\u2019t miss your chance to grab this speaker at its lowest price.",
