      "summary": "Rising postage rates and delivery delays are making paper checks increasingly costly and risky for B2B payments, with 63% of firms reporting fraud and operational setbacks. Digital alternatives such as dynamic discounting, automated cash flow management, and virtual cards offer faster settlement, fraud protection, and visibility, turning payments into a strategic advantage. Despite the entrenched use of checks, the economic and operational pressures are accelerating a shift toward fully digital, automated payment systems.",
