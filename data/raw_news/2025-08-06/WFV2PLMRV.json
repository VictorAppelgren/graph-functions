  "content": "States will lose out on their share of a $42 billion broadband fund if they attempt to dictate rates that internet services providers (ISPs) charge low-income customers, according to a new FAQ from the Trump administration seen by Ars Technica. That means ISPs \u2014 which are subsidized by the government in order to provide low-cost plans \u2014 will be able to set such rates under the BEAD (Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment) program.\n\nThe new language appeared in a BEAD Restructuring Policy Notice (RPN) from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in June. \"Per the RPN, states may not apply state laws to reimpose LSCO (low-cost service option) requirements removed by the RPN... violation would result in rejection of the final proposal [for states to receive funds].\" It added that the the NTIA would only approve plans with low-cost rates set by ISPs.\n\nThe new language would hand ISPs a major win if it holds up. New York state, for one, requires ISPs with more than 20,000 customers to offer $15 broadband plans with minimum 25Mbps download speeds, or $20 plans with 200Mbps speeds, to low-income customers. That law, the Affordable Broadband Act, has held up despite attempts by providers to strike it down in court.\n\nOther states are reconsidering similar laws now. California recently withdrew a bill requiring $15 broadband plans after the NTIA said it could lose out on BEAD funds worth up to $1.86 billion. That decision was excoriated by consumer groups who pointed out that the Supreme Court itself declined to overturn New York's law.\n\nAs he's done many times now, Trump is using federal funds as a cudgel to keep states in line \u2014 despite the fact that states' rights are usually supported by US courts. New York assemblymember Amy Paulin, who spearheaded the state's $15 broadband law, said that she believes the NTIA rule only applies to the other 49 states that don't have price mandates. \"It's our understanding that any [ISP] BEAD awardee would have to comply with the Affordable Broadband Act regardless of federal subsidy,\" she told Ars Technica.",

      "text": "ISPs are fighting to raise the price of low-income broadband\nThey want government money, but argue $30 broadband is impossible.\nA new government program is trying to encourage Internet service providers (ISPs) to offer lower rates for lower income customers by distributing federal funds through states. The only problem is the ISPs don\u2019t want to offer the proposed rates.\nArs Technica obtained a letter sent to US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo signed by more than 30 broadband industry trade groups like ACA Connects and the Fiber Broadband Association as well as several state based organizations. The letter raises \u201cboth a sense of alarm and urgency\u201d about their ability to participate in the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) program. The newly formed BEAD program provides over $42 billion in federal funds to \u201cexpand high-speed internet access by funding planning, infrastructure, deployment and adoption programs\u201d in states across the country, according to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).\nThe money first goes to the NTIA and then it\u2019s distributed to states after they obtain approval from the NTIA by presenting a low-cost broadband Internet option. The ISP industries\u2019 letter claims a fixed rate of $30 per month for high speed Internet access is \u201ccompletely unmoored from the economic realities of deploying and operating networks in the highest-cost, hardest-to-reach areas.\u201d\nThe letter urges the NTIA to revise the low-cost service option rate proposed or approved so far. Twenty-six states have completed all of the BEAD program\u2019s phases.\nAmericans pay an average of $89 a month for Internet access. New Jersey has the highest average bill at $126 per month, according to a survey conducted by U.S. News and World Report. A 2021 study from the Pew Research Center found that 57 percent of households with an annual salary of $30,000 or less have a broadband connection."

      "text": "The Trump administration is telling states they will be shut out of a $42 billion broadband deployment fund if they set the rates that Internet service providers receiving subsidies are allowed to charge people with low incomes.\nThe latest version of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) FAQ on the grant program, released today, is a challenge to states considering laws that would force Internet providers to offer cheap plans to people who meet income eligibility guidelines. One state already has such a law: New York requires ISPs with over 20,000 customers in the state to offer $15 broadband plans with download speeds of at least 25Mbps, or $20-per-month service with 200Mbps speeds.\nOther states have been considering similar laws and were initially emboldened by New York winning a yearslong court battle against ISPs that tried to invalidate the state law. But states may now be dissuaded by the Trump administration's stance against price mandates being applied to the grant program.\nAs we wrote in a July 22 article, California Assemblymember Tasha Boerner told Ars that she pulled a bill requiring $15 broadband plans after NTIA officials informed her that it could jeopardize the state's access to broadband grants. The NTIA's new FAQ makes the agency's stance against state laws even clearer.\nISPs get to choose price of low-cost plan\nThe NTIA rules concern the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, which is distributing $42.45 billion to states for grants that would be given to ISPs that expand broadband access. Although the US law that created BEAD requires Internet providers receiving federal funds to offer at least one \"low-cost broadband service option for eligible subscribers,\" it also says the NTIA may not \"regulate the rates charged for broadband service.\""

      "text": "The Biden administration\u2019s $42 billion broadband program is finally getting underway\nThe president is set to reveal how the funding will be allocated.\nPresident Joe Biden today announced how $42 billion in funding to bolster broadband internet access will be allocated. The investment, which was funded by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, aims to give all Americans access to high-speed internet by 2030.\nTexas is getting the largest slice of funding with $3.3 billion. Eighteen other states are receiving over $1 billion, including Alabama, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington. Every state is getting at least $107 million. Several US territories are included in the program, with $27 million allocated to the US Virgin Islands receiving and $334 million earmarked for Puerto Rico.\n\"With these allocations and other Biden administration investments, all 50 states, DC and the territories now have the resources to connect every resident and small business to reliable, affordable high-speed internet by 2030,\" the White House said in a statement.\nLast year, the White House announced an initiative that would allocate at least $100 million to each state through the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) Program. The remainder of the funding was on hold until the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) drew up a more detailed coverage map showing which homes and businesses lacked high-speed internet access. The funding will be allocated based on the map.\nThe FCC released its first draft of the overhauled map, which incorporates more granular data, in November. Still, politicians on both sides of the aisle were concerned it left out millions of businesses and homes and urged the White House to delay the broadband funding efforts until issues were resolved.\nAfter taking feedback from the public and states, the FCC unveiled an updated version in May. According to The Washington Post, the updated map addressed around 4 million mistakes, resulting in approximately half a million more homes, businesses and other locations without any internet access being identified. In all, the FCC determined that more than 8.3 million homes and businesses lack access to high-speed internet.\nStates will first focus on bringing broadband to locations that have no access at all. If they have any funding left over, they can use it to improve internet access for those with slow speeds.\nIt could take up to two years for the government to dole out all the funding. States, Washington DC and other territories will have until the end of the year to submit their initial proposals for how to run their grant programs. Once the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Telecommunications and Information Administration approves the initial plans, states will be able to request access to at least 20 percent of their allocation. However, they might not obtain access to all of their funds until the plans are finalized, which may take until 2025, according to Reuters.\nMany of the locations that lack broadband access are in rural areas. By and large, major providers have shied away from rolling out broadband in these locales due to their smaller populations and the high cost of installing infrastructure.\nUpdate 6/26 12:06PM ET: Added details about the funding"

  "argos_summary": "States risk losing access to a $42 billion broadband fund if they impose rate regulations on internet service providers (ISPs) for low-income customers, as outlined by the Trump administration's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). The new guidelines prevent states from enforcing laws like New York's Affordable Broadband Act, which mandates low-cost plans, leading to concerns among consumer advocates. ISPs argue that proposed low rates are economically unfeasible, prompting states like California to withdraw similar legislation to avoid jeopardizing their funding.",
