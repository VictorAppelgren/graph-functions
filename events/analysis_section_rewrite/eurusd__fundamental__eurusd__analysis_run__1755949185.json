      "feedback": "Your draft is a good starting point but falls short of a world‑class, multi‑year structural analysis. It reads like a high‑level summary rather than a rigorous, first‑principles model. To upgrade it, 1) anchor every claim in the source IDs (e.g., cite 5S9GJV2O3 for Pixel 9 Pro XL’s $1,099 price, UVEQ2SJ0W for Dayforce’s $70‑per‑share sale, ISXY49HGS for the boric‑acid incident, HWGNUP2XG for the $35.99 K‑Cup price). 2) Replace vague “premium segment” with concrete market shares (e.g., 15 % of global smartphone revenue in 2025, 30 % of U.S. premium‑price phones). 3) Build a clear causal chain: AI‑enabled chips → higher device margins → semiconductor earnings → tech index lift; corporate‑governance risk → higher cost of capital → valuation compression; security incident → increased commodity & logistics risk → input‑cost inflation. 4) Quantify risks: e.g., a 10 % rise in semiconductor costs could compress gross margins by 2 pp; a $70‑per‑share sale could trigger a 5 % market‑wide sell‑off in tech. 5) Cite all critical sources (IDs 5S9GJV2O3, UVEQ2SJ0W, ISXY49HGS, HWGNUP2XG) and reconcile any conflicting data (e.g., if another article reports a different price for the Pixel 9 Pro XL). 6) Explicitly state the invariant anchors (real‑rate differentials, terms‑of‑trade, productivity) and transition conditions (e.g., when AI chip demand outpaces supply, when regulatory scrutiny intensifies). 7) Conclude with a base‑case forecast, key risks, watch signals, and confidence level, all backed by numbers and citations. In short, replace generic statements with quantified, source‑backed arguments, structure the causal chain logically, and ensure every claim is traceable to an ID.",
