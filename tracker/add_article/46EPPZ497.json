      "summary": "President Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to reinstate the presidential fitness test for schoolchildren, a move criticized by health experts and activists as a nostalgic, punitive measure that could undermine public health initiatives. Amanda Marcotte argues the test is rooted in unscientific notions of fitness and serves to justify cuts to healthcare and food assistance, while highlighting the broader ‘Make America Healthy Again’ agenda that favors the wealthy and marginalizes vulnerable populations. The proposal has sparked backlash from educators, public health advocates, and lawmakers who warn that the test could exacerbate health disparities and distract from essential services such as Medicaid and nutrition programs.",
