Bessent said the central bank needs a review because it engaged in \u201cfearmongering over tariffs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that what we need to do is examine the entire Federal Reserve institution and whether they have been successful,\u201d Bessent said. \u201cIf this were the [Federal Aviation Administration] and we were having this many mistakes, we would go back and look at why. Why has this happened?\u201d",

      "text": "Interviewed by CNBC Monday (July 21), Scott Bessent declined to comment on reports that he had advised President Donald Trump not to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, saying it would be the president\u2019s decision.\nHowever, he added that the central bank needed a review, arguing it had engaged in \u201cfear-mongering over tariffs.\u201d\n\u201cI think that what we need to do is examine the entire Federal Reserve institution and whether they have been successful,\u201d Bessent said.\n\u201cIf this were the (Federal Aviation Administration) and we were having this many mistakes, we would go back and look at why. Why has this happened?\u201d he said. \u201cAll these PhDs over there, I don\u2019t know what they do.\u201d\nThe report noted that Trump has called on Powell to step down due to the Fed\u2019s hesitancy to lower interest rates. The president has also targeted a $2.5 billion renovation at the Fed\u2019s Washington headquarters that has gone over budget, indicating there could be fraud involved and it might be a reason to fire Powell.\nPowell has said the project was a large one, encompassing several safety upgrades and hazardous materials removals, hence the larger budget.\nAccording to the report, Bessent declined comment on predictions that U.S. financial markets could plunge if Powell was removed from his job. The chairman\u2019s term ends in May of next year, though he will stay on as a Fed governor through January of 2028, the report added.\nTestifying before the House Financial Services Committee last month, Powell said that increased tariffs were likely to \u201cweigh on economic activity\u201d and push up prices.\n\u201cThe effects on inflation could be short-lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level. It is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent,\u201d Powell said. \u201cFor the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.\u201d\nMeanwhile, consumers remain concerned about the quickening pace of inflation, as PYMNTS wrote last week. While consumer sentiment crept up in July, it remains below historical averages, according to preliminary results from the University of Michigan\u2019s Surveys of Consumers.\n\u201cConsumers are unlikely to regain their confidence in the economy unless they feel assured that inflation is unlikely to worsen, for example if trade policy stabilizes for the foreseeable future,\u201d Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu wrote in the report."

      "text": "(Corrects to add dropped word 'who' in paragraph 2)\nBy Jasper Ward\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he will nominate Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran to serve out the final few months of a newly vacant seat at the Federal Reserve while the White House seeks a permanent addition to the central bank's governing board and continues its search for a new Fed chair.\nMiran, who has called for a complete overhaul of the Fed's governance, will take over from Fed Governor Adriana Kugler following her surprise resignation last week, as she returns to her tenured professorship at Georgetown University.\nThe term expires January 31, 2026 and is subject to approval by the Senate.\nTrump said the White House continues to search for someone to serve in the 14-year Fed Board seat that opens February 1. Trump is also weighing options for a successor to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends May 15, 2026.\nTrump has unsuccessfully pressured Fed policymakers -- who include Powell, his six fellow Board members and the 12 Fed bank presidents - to lower interest rates. Appointing Miran to the central bank, even in a placeholder role, gives the president a potentially more direct route to pursue his desire for easier monetary policy and sway over the world's most influential central bank.\n\"Near term, an interim Fed governor Miran gives Trump the best of both worlds: immediate policy influence without surrendering Fed Chair optionality and leverage,\" LHMeyer analyst Derek Tang wrote. \"Disruption from within is a bonus.\"\nMiran, in a paper he co-authored last year for the Manhattan Institute, laid out a case for increasing presidential control of the Fed Board, including by shortening their terms. He also wants to end the \"revolving door\" between the executive branch and the Fed, and nationalize the Fed's 12 regional banks.\nIt is unclear how much time he would have at the Fed to try to deploy such far-reaching reforms, most of which would require Congressional action, or even to vote on interest rates.\nTOUGH QUESTIONS\nAll Fed nominees require Senate confirmation, a process that includes a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, a vote from that panel advancing the nomination and a series of floor votes before the full Senate, where Democrats have been slowing the pace of approval for Trump appointments.\n\"I look forward to quickly considering his nomination in the Senate Banking Committee and hearing more about his plans to increase transparency and accountability at the Federal Reserve to ensure the agency prioritizes its mandate and avoids politics,\" Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott said."
