      "feedback": "This draft has solid anchors (Costa sale around £2.0b after a £3.9b 2018 purchase; 2024 Costa sales ~£1.22b; Nvidia-led AI cycle with the AI 30 roster shift; a data-center electricity demand forecast of about 945 TWh by 2030; KO’s dividend yield/valuation cues from the market data) but it fails to deliver a world‑class pull‑through: the causal chain from AI capex to asset and equity outcomes is underdeveloped, the 3–6 month scenario map is not explicit, and the base case reads as a generic stance rather than a tightened, numbers‑driven forecast with defined triggers, invalidations, and timing windows. To upgrade, (1) restructure into a formal 3–6 month scenario map with four distinct catalysts and explicit triggers and invalidations: Costa sale progress (trigger: bid dynamics and indicative price around £2.0b; invalidation: no credible bidders or price fails to sustain ~£1.8b within 6–8 weeks), Nvidia/AI capex momentum (trigger: data-center demand prints or capex announcements; invalidation: two consecutive quarter QoQ deceleration), Disney park-perk reweighting (trigger: January 5, 2026 policy change and early‑entry uptake data; invalidation: minimal near‑term attendance/pricing impact), and ETF/sector tilt signals (trigger: IUSV/XLV risk‑adjusted exposures move in line with value/quality shifts); (2) add explicit timing windows and path dependency: Costa sale chatter resolves in the near term (weeks to a few quarters); AI‑cycle momentum visible within 2–4 quarters; Disney readthrough by late 2025 into early 2026; (3) tighten the end states with a crisp base case plus 1–2 alts anchored in numbers: base case — defensives IUSV/XLV with KO as ballast and limited near‑term equity risk; alt 1 — higher conviction AI/infra beta with TXN/NVDA–led exposure and a Costa‑positive bid outcome; alt 2 — a stress scenario where Costa divestment pressures KO growth and prompts a more pronounced defensive rotation; (4) quantify inputs and sensitivities using the sources’ numbers: Costa price range £1.8–£2.2b, 2024 Costa sales near £1.22b, AI data-center demand gravity from 945 TWh by 2030 as a backdrop for capex inertia, KO trailing/forward metrics (P/E ~25x, forward ~23.7x, yield ~2.9%) drawn from 2YP1X9B4T; (5) sharpen the transmission logic: AI capex supports compute/semis and AI infrastructure plays (TXN/NVDA‑type exposure) with potential press on cyclics if demand cools, while Costa’s sale acts as a capital‑allocation test for Coca‑Cola’s growth drift and portfolio discipline; (6) reconcile conflicts and tighten sourcing: keep Costa/KO/Disney as separate, clearly delimited catalysts and avoid over‑relying on any single source; (7) increase citation density by attaching each catalyst/claim to STBVARD8F, U3ZK13ZQI, 4661GWFP7, and 2YP1X9B4T as appropriate, and explicitly note where data are forward-looking; (8) trim extraneous context (e.g., broader AI lists from Motley Fool material) to maintain focus on the horizon and map; (9) present a concise watchlist: Costa sale bid dynamics, Nvidia data‑center demand signals, IUSV/XLV factor rotations, KO dividend‑coverage metrics, and Disney attendance/price momentum; and (10) adjust tone/structure to a tight narrative with a base case and 1–2 alternative paths, finishing with a clear confidence level.",
