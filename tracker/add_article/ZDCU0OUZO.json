      "summary": "Apple is slated to unveil the iPhone 17 in September, with rumors pointing to an all‑aluminum chassis for the Pro models and a slimmer iPhone 17 Air that may use titanium. The company is expected to raise prices by about $50 to offset rising component costs and U.S. tariffs, while the event will also showcase iOS 26 with new AI features and a redesigned camera layout. A September 9 event is likely, followed by a launch on September 19, and the lineup will include the standard, Pro, Pro Max, and Air variants with updated storage and battery specs.",
