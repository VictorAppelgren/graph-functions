  "description": "Here's how to bypass age verification and unblock porn sites in the UK. Follow the simple trick and access adult content in the UK.",
  "content": "Bypassing age verification on porn sites in the United Kingdom is a pretty hot subject. The UK government passed the Online Safety Act on July 25th and since then, all adult websites must implement age verification to operate in the country. The law is relatively benign: it protects children from pornography.\n\nHowever, the dark side of the coin is its nature. Visitors must provide a government-issued ID or face scan to verify their age. This violates their privacy and exposes their identity. Fortunately, bypassing age verification on adult sites in the UK is relatively simple.\n\nHow to Bypass Porn Age Verification in the UK?\n\nUsing a VPN to access adult sites has become typical in recent years. High-quality VPNs, such as NordVPN, which is often recommended, ensure prompt access to any porn site in the UK without age verification. VPNs work by altering the user\u2019s online location through an IP change.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the United Kingdom, you need an IP from abroad to bypass porn age verification. To do this, you\u2019ll get NordVPN, install it, and connect to a server abroad.\n\nWith a single click, you\u2019re another person online with a non-UK IP address (you can use a French, German, US IP address for instance, the content shown on these sites will be in English). When you go to Pornhub, YouPorn, or any other adult site, you\u2019ll be able to access all content without any restrictions.\n\nIt will be operable without any form of age verification!\n\nNordVPN is a premium VPN with many perks. It offers unlimited bandwidth, excellent speeds for watching porn, unbeatable privacy, strong security, and more. Above all, it has a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nThis ensures you can watch porn in the UK and bypass age verification for free with a refund at the end. If you like what you see, you can keep using NordVPN and enjoy a world of porn videos at your fingertips.\n\nWe share some tips on watching porn anonymously here, so check them out.\n\nIt\u2019s an all-encompassing law applying to all adult platforms. Our recent guide explains how to access Pornhub in Texas. We essentially provided an identical solution to an identical problem: age verification.\n\nTexas residents know that the majority of websites are unavailable or blocked by age verification. In the UK, at the time of writing, two affected websites are Pornhub and YouPorn.\n\nThese websites require age verification, which you can bypass with the VPN. As a result, non-compliant websites are blocked. Still, they\u2019re also unblockable with NordVPN and other top VPNs like Surfshark, as demonstrated in this guide about Xvideos.\n\nFuture of Pornography in the United Kingdom\n\nThe Online Safety Act is here to stay in the UK, and we don\u2019t reckon it\u2019ll go anywhere anytime soon. Besides, the law\u2019s background is completely benign. Protecting our valuable children should be our priority, after all.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, 8% of children aged 8 to 14 have visited online pornography websites in a month-long period. While it may not sound much, when multiplied by millions, it quickly starts to sound disturbing.\n\nAge verification is a foolproof design that should work flawlessly. However, as an adult, it\u2019s understandable that you want to keep your privacy intact when watching porn. In this case, it\u2019s fine to resort to a workaround.\n\nBypassing age verification as a minor, including by using a VPN, is prohibited.\n\nWhat are the alternatives to VPNs?\n\nIn the UK, a VPN is the most reliable tool for bypassing age verification on porn sites and keeping browsing private. However, it\u2019s not the only option.\n\nHere are a few alternatives people sometimes use:\n\u2022 Proxy servers: While they can hide your IP to access blocked sites, proxies don\u2019t encrypt your traffic. This means your ISP, hackers, or even the proxy owner could still see what you\u2019re doing. They\u2019re also notoriously unreliable and often too slow for streaming adult content.\n\u2022 Tor browser: Tor offers strong anonymity by bouncing your traffic through multiple relays, but the trade-off is speed. Pages load slowly, and video streaming is usually frustrating or nearly impossible. It\u2019s better for private browsing than for watching high-bandwidth content.\n\u2022 Smart DNS services: These can bypass geo-blocks effectively, but they provide no encryption at all. Your ISP can still track your activity, and they offer no real privacy protection, just location spoofing.\n\nWhy is age verification required to watch adult content in the UK?\n\nThe UK government introduced age verification laws to restrict access to adult content for minors and ensure safer online experiences. Websites must verify users\u2019 ages before granting access.\n\nCan I skip age verification in the United Kingdom?\n\nNot directly. UK law now requires ID checks on adult sites. However, you can bypass them using a VPN like NordVPN.\n\nJust install the app, connect to a VPN server in a country without age verification (Ireland or Switzerland for example), and your IP address will change, removing the age check prompts.\n\nIs porn illegal in the UK?\n\nNo, porn is not illegal in the United Kingdom. Adult content is legal but regulated to protect minors. The law requires websites to verify users\u2019 ages to prevent access by anyone under 18.\n\nIn which countries is age verification not required to watch porn?\n\nA lot of countries don\u2019t mandate age verification for adult websites. Common VPN server locations without these requirements include the Netherlands, Ireland, Canada, Switzerland, and Belgium. Using a VPN server in one of these countries often allows access to porn sites without submitting ID or undergoing strict age checks.\n\nCan I use a free VPN to watch porn without age verification in the UK?\n\nWhile a free VPN might help mask your location and bypass some regional restrictions, it is generally not recommended for accessing adult content safely. Free VPNs often have limited speed, weaker security, and may log or sell your data. Additionally, many adult sites use advanced age verification methods that a VPN alone cannot bypass. For better privacy and reliability, paid VPN services with strong encryption and no-logs policies are a safer choice.\n\nAnd if you really don\u2019t want to pay anything, know that most paid VPNs usually offer a free trial lasting several weeks.",

      "text": "With tens of millions of unique visitors monthly, Xvideos is easily one of the most popular adult sites worldwide. That said, that figure would probably be much higher if the website and its spicy content weren\u2019t blocked or otherwise restricted in some porn-averse for religious or moral reasons.\nBlanket ban aside, there are other restrictions to be wary of. For instance, several US states have ID verification laws that require submitting a government-issued ID to use the site. If you\u2019re a fan of the Xvideos in such a location, don\u2019t fret because there\u2019s a way out that involves changing your IP address. The most reliable way to do this is by using a virtual private network (VPN).\nWe\u2019ll run through the problems and their solutions in this article. By the time you\u2019re done reading, you\u2019ll know how to access Xvideos as well as the best VPN providers to use in 2025.\nWhy Do You Need to Use a VPN to Access Xvideos?\nMost people have never considered watching porn with a VPN.\nWhy do you need one, then?\nThe most common reason is that erotic videos and sites are blocked where you are. That\u2019s the case in dozens of countries worldwide, so you\u2019re not alone. Even in the United States, which produces a ton of porn content every day, as many as 19 states have an ID verification law in place to limit access.\nWhile the primary motive is to prevent exposure of kids to potentially harmful content, that barrier ends up keeping many adult watchers away because of the privacy implications of handing over sensitive information to porn sites and third parties.\nWhat\u2019s more, ultra-privacy-focused users also use a VPN to prevent Xvideos and other adult sites from tracking their browsing habits and preferences and collecting their data. They understand that accidental data leaks can happen at any time and that the site can be hacked and their data stolen.\nIn addition, you can use a VPN to hide your indulgence from your ISP. Of course, nobody is going to show up at your door (as long as your preferences are legal), but it can definitely make you feel\u2026 naked knowing all those details are out there. A VPN makes you feel more comfortable knowing your online activities are private. It also prevents your ISP from throttling your connection in the middle of a porn binge.\nHow does a VPN work, you wonder? When you connect to a VPN server (located somewhere without a porn restriction), your internet traffic is encrypted and routed through a secure tunnel to this server and then onto the website.\nIn the process, it masks and changes your IP address, making it appear like you\u2019re visiting the website from somewhere else. Xvideos detects your new IP address and lets you access your favorite content and models.\nThe benefits are two-fold. For one, you can access Xvideos and other porn sites anywhere \u2014 as long as you use a quality VPN service. More on that in a bit. In addition, the VPN\u2019s encrypting and masking process provides a layer of privacy and security over your traffic and data, keeping malicious actors from intercepting it or stealing sensitive information.\nThe Best VPN for Xvideos \u2014 Our 3 Picks for 2025\nAs hinted earlier, you want a superior VPN service to bypass XVideo blocks. Your chosen provider must also be reputable in the privacy and security aspects and have performance covered. We put dozens of VPNs through the wringer, and the providers below are the creme of the crop.\nThey are all premium VPNs. We\u2019ll explain the various reasons why that beats using a free VPN for Xvideos later on.\n7492 servers\n118 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n10 simultaneous connections\n9.4 /10\n3000 servers\n105 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n8 simultaneous connections\n9.1 /10\n27000 servers\n91 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\nUnlimited connections\n9 /10\n1. NordVPN\nThe dependable NordVPN is the best VPN for freely accessing porn websites like Xvideos. NordVPN offers an impressive collection of more than 6,400 servers across 111 locations, including many in porn-friendly countries.\nFurthermore, it breezes past porn blocks that prevent you from accessing Xvideos wherever you are. During our in-house tests, we could easily watch porn in Texas despite the ID verification law in the state.\nBecause there are no data caps or bandwidth limits, you never have to worry about random interruptions to your video streams. Or buffering, for that matter, as NordvPN delivers lightning-fast connection speeds. We enjoyed the best performance from using its custom NordLynx protocol.\nNordVPN is the best VPN choice for the ultra-paranoid. Privacy-wise, it operates a strict no-logs policy that multiple third-party experts have checked. Besides, it\u2019s based in the privacy-friendly Panama.\nAs for security, it employs AES 256-bit encryption to scramble your data, so not even your ISP knows what you\u2019re doing online. The provider\u2019s toolkit includes several other advanced and extra features, including a kill switch and Double VPN.\nWith NordVPN installed, you can access Xvideos on your computer, mobile phone, tablet, streaming device, or smart TV, even with up to 10 devices connected at the same time.\nFor all that, you won\u2019t spend much on a subscription fee, especially if you take advantage of a generous 70% discount on its 2-year plan. There\u2019s also a 30-day money-back guarantee that gives you more than enough time to test the VPN risk-free.\n2. ExpressVPN\nExpressVPN is another great VPN for accessing Xvideos, but it is pricier than NordVPN. With that one drawback aside, here\u2019s what you get in this powerful yet lightweight package.\nFor one, it has a massive network of over 3,000 servers in 105 countries. The VPN is fully optimized to break past geo-restrictions and network blocks and does so with Xvideos hassle-free, regardless of your location. You can also count on it to unblock Chaturbate and other popular adult sites.\nThe hint is in the name \u2014 ExpressVPN is one of the fastest VPNs around. You can expect buttery-smooth streaming, even in 4K resolution. We like the VPN\u2019s proprietary Lightway protocol because of its optimal combination of speed and security.\nIs ExppressVPN safe? You bet it is. And your data is, as well. The provider doesn\u2019t store activity logs, so there\u2019s no chance your private habits ever leak.\nIt\u2019s also loaded with security tools, like bank-level encryption, a kill switch and DNS leak protection. All ExpressVPN\u2019s servers are obfuscated, so your ISP can\u2019t throttle your data due to VPN use or streaming.\nExpressVPN is also widely compatible and has native apps for most popular operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. One active subscription covers up to eight devices at once.\nGranted, ExpressVPN is on the high-end in terms of pricing, but by clicking the button below, you can get a chunk off with its whopping 49% discount on the annual plan. You\u2019ll also receive a 30-day money-back guarantee with the promise of a full refund if you\u2019re unimpressed.\n3. Private Internet Access\nSecurity-focused PIA wraps up our list of the best VPNs for Xvideos in 2025. The provider stands out immediately with its massive server network (by far the most expansive on this list). It has more than 30,000 servers across 91 countries. Consequently, you\u2019ll never run out of connection options to unblock Xvideos.\nSpeaking of which, the VPN beats any blocks on the porn site instantly. We tried it against several other similar sites, and it unblocked Pornhub, xHamster, and various others. It\u2019s an effective solution for the ID verification issue in US states like Utah, Texas, and Nebraska.\nThanks to 10 Gbps servers and the inclusion of WireGuard, choppy streaming isn\u2019t a thing with PIA, especially when you connect to a nearby server.\nDespite its headquarters in the United States, you can trust the VPN to keep you under the radar. Private Internet Access has undertaken multiple independent audits of its no-logs policy and posts quarterly transparency reports. What\u2019s more, all its apps are open-source.\nPIA offers security features like military-grade encryption and an advanced multi-level kill switch to prevent IP leaks. What\u2019s more, with MACE, it provides protection against malware and malicious ads on porn sites.\nPrivate Internet Access comes at a pretty affordable price. On top of that, it offers unlimited simultaneous connections on one subscription. You can get it below with a 30-day money-back guarantee attached.\nHow to Access Xvideos Anywhere With a VPN\nIt\u2019s pretty straightforward. All you need is a subscription to one of the VPNs above. We prefer NordVPN and will demonstrate the steps to follow with that VPN in order to watch content freely on Xvideos.\n- Subscribe to a VPN service with a reputable service like NordVPN. Choose a plan and complete the payment to register an account.\n- Install the VPN app. Download and install the VPN app for your device from the official site or mobile app store.\n- Connect to a server. Log in to the VPN app and select a server where there\u2019s no porn ban or block. Wait until the VPN establishes the connection.\n- Enjoy Xvideos unrestricted. You\u2019re free to enjoy your steamy sessions without worrying about blocks or privacy issues.\nCan a free VPN unblock Xvideos?\nThat\u2019s not a good idea. To begin with, most free VPNs will struggle to consistently unblock Xvideos and other adult sites in countries with porn bans.\nThere are also performance issues to worry about. Most VPN services only allow free users access to a handful of servers. As you can imagine, those servers are usually congested during peak internet periods, leading to snail-slow connection speeds, which can be quite frustrating.\nEven worse, they can expose your privacy, which defeats the primary purpose of using a VPN in the first place.\nTake our word for it and use a premium service instead. The benefits are well worth the cost.\nConclusion\nThere\u2019s nothing fun about finding access to your favorite adult site blocked. However, if that\u2019s the situation you find yourself in, you can instantly overcome it with a quality VPN for Xvideos. The best part? It will be just as effective for other porn sites, wherever you are.\nBased on extensive testing, NordVPN is the best VPN for Xvideos. Below, you can grab a subscription to its two-year plan for 70% off, along with a 30-day refund window."

      "text": "Your online presence is defined by a crucial parameter called an IP address. Many ponder how to change their IP address because of many perks such as privacy and bypassing certain online restrictions.\nAfter all, an IP address is associated with your location, amongst other things. When someone knows this address, that person also knows where you are. The same rings true for the websites you frequently visit, which is how they track you online and bombard you with targeted ads.\nGiven the IP\u2019s association with the user\u2019s location, we can conclude it\u2019s fixed. Or can you hide your IP address somehow? Of course! There are plentiful methods, some easier, some harder, some more effective, some less.\nToday, we\u2019ll examine 5 of them and showcase their advantages and shortcomings.\nHow to Change Your IP Address \u2013 5 Simple Methods\nIf you\u2019re short on time, you\u2019ll want to know how to change your IP immediately. Our team of experts tested numerous workarounds, concluding that these 5 are the most effective:\n- Using a VPN Service (Our Recommendation: NordVPN)\n- Connecting to a Proxy\n- Using the Tor Browser\n- Changing Your IP Address Manually\n- Rebooting Your Router\nSatisfied? No? In that case, refer to our comprehensive guides on changing your IP address below.\nWe explain every method in depth to help you fully grasp the concept of altering your IP across all your devices.\n1. Using a VPN Service\nAdvantages\n- Encrypted connection\n- No ISP or third-party tracking\n- Ability to unblock streaming sites\n- Lots of locations to pick from (100+)\n- It works on all devices (including routers and smart TVs)\n- Top-tier performance\nShortcomings\n- Great VPNs cost money (usually not much)\n- Not all VPNs are safe\n- Free providers can be slow\nThe first, most effective and safest way to change your IP address is by using a VPN. In our list of the top 10 VPNs, we highlighted their humongous abilities.\nSuch a service can not only alter your IP but also provide you with additional security and privacy.\nBetter yet, a VPN allows you to get over geo-blocks, download torrents anonymously, and even save money on online purchases by changing your online location. Speaking of online locations, VPNs offer hundreds of them and a prime example is NordVPN \u2013 our #1 pick.\nHide your IP Address with NordVPN\nNordVPN even offers a no-logs policy and uses 256-bit encryption to protect your traffic from prying eyes. With 6,400+ servers in 111 countries, users can easily get another IP address from a specific location and reap all the benefits.\nThe only downside is that NordVPN isn\u2019t free. Neither is any quality VPN service. However, if you stick with us, we\u2019ll explain how to change your IP address with NordVPN and enjoy the service for free for up to 30 days.\nHow to Change Your IP With a VPN?\nNordVPN, or any other reputable VPN service, offers apps for all devices. This means the solution can be applied not only to your computer but also to your phone, tablet, laptop, Smart TV, and so on.\nThe steps below are the same for all of these devices too, making the solution the most effective. Here they are:\n- Subscribe to a VPN service. We recommend NordVPN whose 2-year plan is discounted by more than 60% at the moment. In addition, all plans come with a no-question money-back guarantee, which can be taken advantage of (Step 5)\n- Download and install the VPN to your device.\n- Open the VPN app and sign in with your credentials. You provided them in Step 1.\n- Connect to a server in the country whose IP you want to get. We used the USA.\n- (Optional) Get a refund from NordVPN in the first 30 days if you no longer need it. This way, you\u2019ll hide your IP address for free, as no money is lost. You can do this by contacting its support team and requesting a refund.\nOther VPNs We Recommend for Changing Your IP Address\nWhile NordVPN is our favorite pick for this case, we think other providers will do just fine, especially if they offer a wealth of locations to pick from.\nOur favorite options apart from NordVPN include:\n- ExpressVPN. A safe provider with servers in 105 countries and more than 160 cities. It\u2019s one of the fastest services with unlimited traffic, a no-log policy, and advanced security features for blocking ads and trackers.\n- Private Internet Access. An amazing service with 30,000 servers in nearly 100 countries. We love it for its incredible privacy and add-ons like the SOCKS5 proxy and Shadowsocks for added obfuscation. Read more about it in our Private Internet Access review.\n- Surfshark. It\u2019s an inexpensive service with over 3,200 servers in 100 countries. Packing unlimited connections, stable speeds, split tunneling, and MultiHop, it\u2019s one of the most advanced providers to use for your IP address change.\n- CyberGhost. With more than 12,000 servers in 100 countries and affordable prices, it\u2019s surely an attractive option. This VPN offers Dedicated IPs and features like WireGuard, P2P servers, Perfect Forward Secrecy, and many others. It\u2019s the only VPN with a 45-day refund policy as well!\n2. Connecting to a Proxy\nAdvantages\n- You can find plenty of free proxies\n- Like VPNs, proxies work on all devices\n- They\u2019re easy to use for the most part\nShortcomings\n- No connection encryption\n- Free proxies usually collect your sensitive info\n- Paid proxies are very complicated to set up for beginners\n- Slow speeds and instabilities\n- Not many locations to pick from\n- No P2P/Streaming optimization\nAnother method of hiding your IP address is using a proxy and it works on all devices. To make it clear, we don\u2019t recommend this option because of several reasons. Proxies aren\u2019t as safe as VPNs, especially when talking about free proxies.\nPaid proxies, however, are quite different.\nThese proxies cost quite a bit of money but from our experience, they still rarely provide fast speeds compared to VPNs and often come with a heap of connection problems. Check out Oxylabs, Bright Data, or NetNut, the best proxy providers, and see how opulent they can be.\nIf you want to quickly alter your IP address, you can go for a simple free proxy like Hide.me Proxy, which you can find online.\nIn our test, this proxy was barely fast enough for basic browsing and occasional YouTube streaming. Hide.me Proxy offers three locations \u2013 the Netherlands, Germany, and Finland.\nSo right from the start, you\u2019re getting way less than with NordVPN or ExpressVPN, for instance.\nTo use this proxy, simply enter the domain address select the country you want, and click Go. You\u2019ll now visit the site using an IP address of the proxy server rather than your own.\nFree proxies, however, mask your IP address only for the site you\u2019re visiting, while all other traffic originates from your original IP address.\nWhile Hide.me Proxy is safe, most free proxies collect and likely sell your sensitive data.\nThey\u2019re slow, don\u2019t offer any encryption, and won\u2019t unblock streaming services. Not to mention they\u2019re a poor option for torrenting as well unless we\u2019re talking about the SOCKS5 proxy, which, sadly, you won\u2019t find for free.\n3. Using the Tor Browser\nAdvantages\n- Tor is free to download\n- Excellent anonymity (but not better than a VPN)\n- Tor provides access to \u201c.onion\u201d sites\nShortcomings\n- Extremely slow connections\n- Non-encrypted entry node\n- Not working on iOS\n- It doesn\u2019t let you choose the location\n- Tor nodes can be compromised\nTor Browser is often associated with exploring the dark web in privacy. Sure, it\u2019s one of its uses. However, Tor\u2019s main appeal is the ability to hide your IP address and anonymize your traffic. Tor relies on the so-called nodes to fully anonymize and encrypt the connection.\nWhen connected to Tor, the traffic bonuses across a myriad of Tor nodes where it becomes encrypted. The traffic is then decrypted before reaching the final destination i.e. the website you\u2019re trying to visit. As you can see, Tor is quite secure at first.\nHow to Use Tor?\nTor is a Firefox-based web browser, so it functions the same:\n- Download Tor from the official site. It\u2019s available for Android, Windows, and macOS.\n- Install Tor on your device.\n- Open Tor and visit any site you want. From the moment you press Enter to visit the site, your in-browser connection will be encrypted.\nExamining Tor more closely we can already see some issues. First, your ISP (Internet Service Provider) can see that you\u2019re using Tor and suspect that you\u2019re performing illicit activities on the dark web. The entry node in Tor is NOT encrypted, leaving you exposed to the public eye.\nSecond, Tor nodes aren\u2019t always very secure and can sometimes be compromised. As a result, your sensitive data may still leak. From the perspective of changing your IP address, Tor isn\u2019t great because it doesn\u2019t let you select a location like NordVPN or another VPN.\nThis solution is great for, let\u2019s say, hiding your IP address, rather than changing it to a desired location. This spawns a flock of problems, such as the inability to bypass geo-blocks or download torrents privately. Tor is also very slow due to all the encryption going on.\nYou\u2019ll notice that connecting to a site can take up to 30 seconds and sometimes more. This is a price to pay for added security that you don\u2019t need to pay with a VPN while still getting stronger security and privacy. At the very least, Tor is free, so that\u2019s something.\n4. Changing Your IP Address Manually\nAdvantages\n- Simple to perform on desktop/mobile devices\n- It costs nothing\nShortcomings\n- No security benefits\n- You\u2019re still using an IP from your Internet Provider\n- Isn\u2019t suitable for safe torrenting or streaming\nSome users won\u2019t want to use a VPN, Tor, proxies, and so on. How to change your IP address in that case? Well, there\u2019s the option to alter your IP manually but this doesn\u2019t have any specific benefits, to be frank \u2013 at least not \u201cdramatic\u201d ones.\nSure, you\u2019ll be able to bypass an IP address ban if you\u2019re a gamer, for example. But you\u2019ll still not change your online location, gain additional privacy, and so on. Therefore, your ISP will still see your online activities and be able to impose restrictions.\nIf you\u2019re okay with this, we\u2019ll explain how to change your IP address manually on Windows, macOS, Android, and iPhone (iOS).\nWindows 11/10 Manual IP Address Change\n- Make sure you\u2019re signed in with your administrator account.\n- Open Control Panel.\n- Click on \u201cNetwork and Internet.\u201d\n- Select \u201cNetwork and Sharing Center.\u201d\n- On the left side, locate \u201cChange Adapter Settings\u201d and select it.\n- In the new window, find your connection and right-click on it.\n- Select \u201cProperties.\u201d\n- Find \u201cInternet Protocol 4 (TCP/IPv4)\u201d or \u201cInternet Protocol 6 (TCP/IPv6)\u201d depending on which type of IP address you\u2019re using.\n- Select the appropriate option and click \u201cProperties.\u201d\n- Tick the box next to \u201cUse the Following IP Address.\u201d\n- Enter the desired IP address and press OK.\nmacOS Manual IP Address Change\n- Open \u201cSystem Settings\u201d and select \u201cNetwork.\u201d\n- Click on \u201cWi-Fi\u201d and then press \u201cDetails\u2026\u201d\n- From here, click on \u201cTCP/IP\u201d on the left side.\n- On the right, you\u2019ll see \u201cConfigure IPv4\u201d or \u201cConfigure IPv6.\u201d Select one based on your IP type and make sure it\u2019s set to \u201cManually.\u201d\n- Next to \u201cIPv4 Address\u201d or \u201cIPv6 Address\u201d, type in the new IP you want to use and click OK.\nChange Your IP Address Manually on Android\nFor this guide, we\u2019ll use our Samsung phone but the same trick applies to all other brands.\n- Open Settings.\n- Find your WiFi settings \u2013 it\u2019s titled \u201cConnections\u201d on Samsung. Tap on it.\n- Select your WiFi network and open its settings.\n- Open advanced WiFi settings for that network. On Samsung, it\u2019s the \u201cView More\u201d button that opens additional options.\n- Under \u201cIP Settings\u201d, select \u201cStatic\u201d instead of \u201cDHCP.\u201d\n- Now enter your IP address and press Save.\nChange Your IP address Manually on iOS (iPhone and iPad)\n- Open Settings.\n- Select \u201cWi-Fi\u201d and tap on the network you\u2019re using.\n- Find the \u201cIPv4 Address\u201d menu and select \u201cConfigure IP.\u201d\n- Tap on \u201cManual\u201d and enter the new IP address.\n- Press Save and you\u2019re done.\n5. Rebooting Your Router\nAdvantages\n- It\u2019s easy to restart your router\n- Zero costs\nShortcomings\n- An IP change isn\u2019t guaranteed\n- You often need to wait for a long period before your IP changes\n- It offers no additional privacy\n- Doesn\u2019t work if your ISP doesn\u2019t use Dynamic IP addresses\nWhen you\u2019re without an internet connection, the first thing that comes to mind is restarting the router. Little did you know that rebooting the router can change your IP address. At least in some cases. You see, most ISPs in the world use dynamic IP addresses.\nThis means you\u2019re not using a single IP address to go online. Instead, ISPs shuffle different IP addresses between their users. One day, your IP can be \u201c175.62.32.21\u201d, for example, while another day, for whatever reason, your ISP can assign an IP address like \u201c175.62.32.28\u201d.\nHowever, both IP addresses belong to your Internet Service Provider and they serve the same purpose. The trick to alter your IP address lies in unplugging your router for a while. Some recommend a few minutes while more extreme experts suggest waiting for 24 hours.\nOur experience showed that around 10-15 minutes is enough before you can plug the router back in. After that, you should be assigned a new IP address that, again, belongs to your ISP. Our team of experts deems this solution rather undependable.\nFor one, you won\u2019t always get a new IP address, which can be true if your ISP doesn\u2019t use dynamic IP addresses. Two, it\u2019s not safe compared to using an affordable premium VPN like NordVPN. You\u2019re still under your ISP\u2019s watchful eye, without encryption and other advantages.\nThird, some users reported that this solution required a lot more than a few hours to take effect. We\u2019ve heard of some people waiting for a DAY. In today\u2019s day and age, spending a day without an internet connection is quite unnerving if your job is internet-dependent.\nWhy Should You Change Your IP Address?\nWe\u2019ve thoroughly covered the 5 most effective methods to mask your IP address and use a new one. Doing so brings with itself undeniable benefits that people who switch their IPs look forward to. Beware that most of these advantages are tied to VPNs.\nAmplified Privacy and Security\nA VPN or even Tor will positively impact your privacy and security. Using another IP to go online hides your original one, allowing you to pose as another person on the internet. This is very true when using NordVPN, for instance, whose security is unbeatable.\nWith features like 256-bit encryption, no one can track you online \u2013 not even your ISP. NordVPN, along with ExpressVPN and CyberGhost, offers a kill switch that protects your identity even if the connection breaks. We then have a no-logs policy.\nThis feature is present in all top-tier providers. It means the VPN doesn\u2019t keep any sensitive information on its servers. Such information includes your browsing history, IP address, DNS requests, connection data, and so on. These advantages are present in Tor and VPN only.\nHowever, if you use a paid proxy service, you\u2019ll find plenty of security features as well. As said, they\u2019re rarely worth the price except if you\u2019re into scraping and other \u201cnon-typical\u201d stuff that such services offer.\nUnblocking Restricted Websites\nUnblocking sites is a key benefit of your IP address change. Again, this will be valid with a VPN (and some proxies). By selecting another online location and country, you can appear as if you were browsing from that country. This is how people unblock streaming portals.\nThe same goes for other restricted sites such as online bookies and casinos. Changing your IP to the UK means you can access Betfair, bet365, and other prevalent online betting sites. Changing your IP address with a VPN opens up limitless possibilities.\nThink of any restricted website and you\u2019ll likely be able to access it.\nAnonymous Torrenting\nTorrenting is all but safe and anonymous. With your IP address visible to other \u201cPeers\u201d in the P2P network, your privacy is exposed at all times. Let\u2019s not forget about torrent sites and their logging practices that go against your privacy by storing your download history.\nThis is frequently reported to ISPs and authorities to prosecute and fine torrent users. A simple IP address change with a VPN can remedy this issue. Once the connection is encrypted, every bit of traffic will originate from another address of the VPN server in another country.\nThe torrent site will now see the new IP and collect the download history based on this IP address. Even if this data ends up in someone\u2019s hands, that entity will see that the download history belongs to a VPN IP and do nothing. This is nearly impossible with the other four methods!\nSaving Money on Online Purchases\nYou\u2019ll discover that the prices of online goodies will differ from country to country. This applies to apps, games, and even physical goodies. People frequently travel cheaper with a VPN, as flight tickets and hotel/parking rentals can be more affordable in some countries.\nIf you change your IP address to a less developed country, you\u2019ll start to see different prices, as websites will think that you\u2019re in the country you\u2019ve chosen. As a result, they\u2019ll display prices for that specific country. We recommend experimenting a bit and see what you can find.\nOur team managed to save upwards of hundreds of dollars annually on business flights and vacations.\nCircumventing Firewalls\nIf you\u2019re in a censored country like China or Russia, your internet space will be limited. Using a VPN to change your IP address to another country can be beneficial. VPNs offer obfuscation that masks your VPN connection, making look like an \u201cordinary\u201d connection instead.\nYou can use this to still be able to visit social media and VoIP apps in regions that forbid it. We tested the other four methods and they don\u2019t work, however. Albeit, some types of proxies are made for firewall restrictions, such as a Shadowsocks proxy.\nPaid proxies \u2013 better ones \u2013 can also sometimes bypass the Great Firewall of China and firewalls in other countries. But for this case, it\u2019s smarter to use obfuscation from NordVPN or ExpressVPN. You can find out more about the top-rated VPNs for China here.\nSeveral Types of IP Addresses\nLet\u2019s briefly explain the types of IP addresses. This is important to know to fully understand which IP you\u2019re changing when you apply any of the 5 workarounds we presented.\n- Public IP address: Speaking of IP address changing, this is the affected IP address. It\u2019s the one visible to others and the one that your ISP assigns to the home network (router). Every device connected to this network has the same public IP address that you can hide with a VPN, proxy, Tor, etc\u2026\n- Private IP address: Every device connected to the network has the same public but a different (unique) private IP address assigned by the router. It can\u2019t be seen outside the network and serves only as a means of easier communication between the devices. This IP address can\u2019t be changed by a VPN or other methods we explained.\n- Static IP address: As the name implies, this IP address is fixed. It\u2019s usually used by multiple users, likely through a Virtual Private Network service. This type of IP can be blocked because of hundreds of requests sent via the same IP address that some sites can register as spam.\n- Dynamic IP address: This one is the opposite of the static variant. As explained, the dynamic IP address will change when you disconnect and connect again. We think this address is better for privacy but isn\u2019t great for banking apps/sites that will register an IP address change and potentially block your access or require additional verification.\n- Dedicated IP address: Finally, there\u2019s a dedicated IP address. It\u2019s similar to the static counterpart, as it\u2019s always the same but is used by one person only. Privacy isn\u2019t its strength but it can bypass CAPTCHA puzzles and prevent IP address blacklisting that happens with static IPs. It\u2019s not free and can be bought from a VPN service (NordVPN, PIA, Surfshark, \u2026)\nIs Changing My IP Address Legal?\nDoing this isn\u2019t anything revolutionary and millions of internet users do this daily. Whether you\u2019re using a VPN, Tor, proxy, or other methods, you can do this safely and legally. The problem lies in what you\u2019re doing with the IP, which can be legal or illegal.\nIf you\u2019re looking to:\n- Preserve your online privacy\n- Unblock geo-restricted content\n- Download non-copyrighted torrents\n- Avoid ISP throttling, and so on\u2026\nUsing another IP address is completely FINE. However, if the purpose of an IP address change is to:\n- Distribute copyrighted material\n- Indulge in death threats and online harassment\n- Buy/sell drugs and weapons, and so on\u2026\nAltering your online identity is ILLEGAL. We assume that most of our readers are on the righteous side of the law. Henceforth, it\u2019s perfectly fine and legal to use a VPN or any other service and method we presented for this purpose.\nHow to Change My IP Address for Free?\nYou can do that with the five methods we discussed. If you\u2019re thinking about using free VPNs or proxies, you know our unfavorable opinion about that. Free VPNs and free proxies deliberately slow down your connection and limit your \u201cabilities\u201d, so to speak.\nThese services don\u2019t work for torrenting, they\u2019re incapable of streaming and provide weak security. Both are notorious for data collection, as well, which can be pretty dangerous. While free proxies usually don\u2019t allow you to select the location, neither do some free VPNs.\nProton VPN, one of the most reliable free VPNs, offers only ONE location. Hide.me, another worthy option, offers 8, while NordVPN offers 110+. Enough said. From the perspective of changing your IP address safely, free proxies and VPNs don\u2019t make much sense.\nWe\u2019ll remind you of a 30-day money-back guarantee from providers like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and PIA. Such providers can be used for free for 30 days with a refund at the end. Our team deems this the #1 solution to hide your IP with the most benefits.\nThe Bottom Line\nWith everything said in this comprehensive guide, we\u2019re confident you know how to change your IP address on all devices. The best and most reliable route is the VPN. It works on all systems and allows you to modify your IP address in virtually 2-3 seconds.\nProxy is also viable but with a lot more compromises and shortcomings. Hide.me Proxy is the only free option we recommend. We then have Tor whose anonymity and privacy are decent but with no ability to select a specific country, making it great only to hide your IP.\nThe remaining two methods are the least attractive. While easy, they provide no other benefits, such as security, privacy, website unblocking, and so forth."

      "text": "Calling a VPN service best-rated is easier said than done for us. Yet, when you read a typical review of NordVPN, people who tested it first-hand frequently refer to it exactly like that. Every NordVPN test yields excellent results, seemingly making it the #1 VPN service to use. NordVPN is a pretty familiar service. It\u2019s a product of Nord Security \u2014 a well-known company. This provider built its strong reputation around three concrete pillars; security, privacy, and performance. However, the service is much more than this.\nThink of a 360-degree app for online protection, which is an accurate representation of this software. It\u2019s clear as day that we\u2019re discussing a powerful VPN service with plenty of experience in the industry. After all, you don\u2019t need this NordVPN test to know what it is.\nHowever, if you\u2019ve never used it, this in-depth NordVPN analysis will come in handy. Our team has been using it since its inception and is living through its various stages of improvement. We noticed vast improvements to the formula, especially in the past few years.\nThis implies a surge of advantages that the majority of users will enjoy. However, no VPN is perfect and this one still has a few shortcomings. Before you shell out your money on it, read our exhaustive NordVPN review to see what our experienced team of experts thinks of it.\nNordVPN\nAfter testing several dozen VPNs, we can say that NordVPN is the best VPN of [year]. With excellent speeds, a user-friendly app, and many advanced features, you won't lack anything by opting for their service. Moreover, it won't even cost you much.\nPros\n- Multiple third-party audits\n- AES-256 bank-grade encryption\n- Robust apps for all platforms\n- Double VPN servers for added security\n- 115+ server locations to pick from\n- Affordable and generous 2-year plans\n- Faster than any VPN we tested\nCons\n- No website split tunneling\n- Occasional connection problems on Windows & macOS\nNordVPN Features: A Quick Rundown\n| \ud83d\udcb8 Starting price | $3.09 a month for 24 months |\n| \ud83d\udd16 Money-back guarantee | 30 days |\n| \ud83c\udf10 Protocols | OpenVPN, NordWhisper, NordLynx, IKEv2 |\n| \ud83e\udd78 No-log policy | Yes |\n| \ud83d\udcbe Servers | 7,600+ in 118 countries |\n| \u23f8\ufe0f Double VPN | Yes |\n| \ud83e\udda0 Malware/ad/tracker protection | Yes (in the Plus plan and above) |\n| \ud83d\udcfa Streaming and P2P | Allowed |\n| \ud83d\udcaf Third-party audits | Yes (Deloitte and PwC) |\n| \ud83d\udcbb Supported platforms | Windows, iOS, Android, macOS, Linux, and more |\n| #\ufe0f\u20e3 Simultaneous connections | 10 |\n| \u260e\ufe0f Customer support | 24/7 live chat, email, help center |\nNordVPN Pricing: How Much Does It Cost?\nBefore trying out NordVPN and discussing our test results, let us talk about its prices.\nWe know many of you are wondering about the NordVPN cost and whether it\u2019s expensive. We\u2019ll say only one word \u2014 no. Bear in mind that the provider doesn\u2019t have a \u201cfixed\u201d price.\nThis means it frequently offers different discounts and deals, often including several free months. Speaking of that, at the moment of crafting this in-depth NordVPN review, this service offers 3 free months for its 2-year plans.\nWe can see that the service exudes unbelievably low prices close to $3 a month. The Basic plan is a good starting point. However, the best value deal on this service is the Plus plan with a price of around $4 a month.\nWhy?\nBecause it offers malware protection, tracker/ad blocker, and a few other features we tested in this review. We appreciate NordVPN for being an all-around cybersecurity suite. With a VPN and malware protection, at this price, you\u2019re not getting better software anywhere.\nThe Complete plan comes with Nord Security\u2019s reliable NordLocker encrypted cloud storage. You\u2019re getting 1 TB, which should be ample. At under $5 at the time of writing, this plan is on par, price-wise, with ExpressVPN\u2019s least expensive 2-year deal. Should we add that it\u2019s better, too?\nMoney-Back Guarantee and Free Trial\nWhen it comes to a money-back guarantee, the Panamanian giant is more than generous. All plans are subject to a 30-day refund policy. This allows you to enjoy the provider for 30 days, or not enjoy it if you dislike it, and call it quits, being reimbursed at the end.\nIn our years-long NordVPN use, we always appreciated this feature. You can get a refund no matter the reason. Even if you just don\u2019t need the service anymore. Contact the support team through live chat, explain the problem, and voila!\nThe provider doesn\u2019t offer a full-fledged free trial, though. This refund policy is sort of a free trial if you plan to get a refund. However, Android users who sign up on their phones get a 7-day trial, which we ended up appreciating in our NordVPN review.\nPayment Methods\nIf you\u2019ve already read our test of NordVPN, or at least the gist of it above, you might want to purchase it. In that case, you\u2019re looking at four payment methods:\n- Credit/debit cards\n- Google Pay\n- PayPal\n- Cryptocurrencies\nPick one, snag a discount on NordVPN\u2019s 2-year plan, and enjoy.\nEase of Use & Compatibility\nTo be frank, we love NordVPN\u2019s apps. They\u2019re modern. Cutting-edge in a way. However, beginners might find them slightly intimidating with all of the unknown features at first. Rest assured, the provider\u2019s apps are some of the simplest around.\nOnce you\u2019re on the server list, it takes one click to connect to a server. NordVPN\u2019s hastiness lets you connect in 1-2 seconds and conceal your IP address from the prying eyes. The mobile app, as you see, looks the same, at least aesthetics-wise.\nWe love that mobile users get almost the same features, even including Threat Protection Lite. In our experience, both iOS and Android apps are optimized well. Both sides have access to all of NordVPN\u2019s protocols which we\u2019ll discuss in this NordVPN review for 2025.\nOn the compatibility side, the provider doesn\u2019t disappoint.\nOne curiosity is that it allows for 10 simultaneous connections, which is more than ExpressVPN and CyberGhost. Being a highly appreciated service by millions of users, the provider\u2019s supported devices/systems include:\n- Windows, macOS, and Linux computers and laptops\n- iOS and Android smartphones and tablets\n- Fire TV, tvOS, and Android TV systems (including Nvidia Shield TV)\n- Routers (Asus, pfSense, Tomato, DD-WRT, Netduma, \u2026)\n- Gaming consoles like Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox\n- Firefox, Brave, Edge, and Chrome extensions\nWe\u2019ll briefly touch on NordVPN\u2019s extensions which are some of the best around. They offer full WebRTC protection and VPN-like capabilities for streaming, torrenting, and safe browsing (location spoofing, for example). Now that we\u2019re at it, explore our favorite Chrome VPN extensions here.\nSecurity Features of NordVPN\nOne of the reasons you\u2019re reading this NordVPN review and test is that you want to know whether it\u2019s safe and secure. More than 10 years ago when we started to use it, we wondered the same. Yet, even then, we quickly concluded that its safety is undeniable.\nWe tested and evaluated all of its security features. The list is mile-long, so let\u2019s make haste.\nBasic VPN Features\nNordVPN\u2019s basic features are mandatory and include:\n- 256-bit GCM encryption. It\u2019s the strongest encryption in the world, unbreakable even by NSA-level hackers.\n- Perfect Forward Secrecy. The provider utilizes PFS, generating unique encryption keys for every connection. As a result, it\u2019s impossible to trace the connection and read its contents. Even if this happens, when the user disables the VPN, the encryption key is useless, as it won\u2019t be assigned to either of the forthcoming connections.\n- Kill Switch. A standard feature in every VPN. In our NordVPN test, it worked well with a few connection problems we encountered. It shuts down your internet traffic to prevent IP leaks if the VPN connection breaks. NordVPN even offers an app-level kill switch to apply the same effect to chosen apps. We explained how the kill switch works in a separate guide.\n- Split tunneling. It\u2019s here to route specific apps through the encrypted tunnel or prevent them from using a VPN. In return, you can encrypt only the traffic from the apps that would benefit from additional security or location change. No website split tunneling can be found, which our team isn\u2019t so happy about.\n- DNS Filtering. Once you enable it, NordVPN will block malicious sites and ads, as long as you\u2019re connected to the VPN server. However, we don\u2019t like that NordVPN doesn\u2019t list the blocked threats to inform you about whether it truly works. In our test, we couldn\u2019t tell whether it truly works for the most part.\nAdvanced Security Features\nOur NordVPN analysis is empty without advanced security features that the provider is so proud of. Keep in mind we tested the service using the Plus plan, which includes all of the core and bonus functions.\nSpecialty Servers\nA quality server network isn\u2019t all about numbers. Sometimes, it\u2019s the specialty servers that significantly boost the experience. The provider includes the following servers:\n- Double VPN. This is by far our favorite feature of NordVPN. We use these servers pretty much daily. They route your traffic through two servers in different countries for double the encryption. NordVPN offers pre-built Double VPN locations for easier access, including the US-Canada, Netherlands-Switzerland, and so on. Our experience shows that Double VPN servers are slower because of stronger encryption but they\u2019re still capable of streaming and high-speed downloads.\n- Obfuscated Servers. They use OpenVPN TCP and obfuscation to get over firewalls. We used these servers in China and other censored regions. They work well to bypass DPI and enjoy free internet in the harshest conditions. Read our NordVPN review further to see how efficient these servers were in practice.\n- P2P Servers. As implied by the name, these are made for safe and secure torrent downloads. They\u2019re also optimized for speed and stability and can take full advantage of NordLynx to squeeze out every drop of performance.\n- Onion Over VPN Servers. These servers are in the Netherlands and Switzerland. They\u2019re used for Tor Over VPN connections when you want to ensure additional anonymity and privacy. You can use them for going on the dark web safely, for example.\nThreat Protection Pro\nUsers will be interested in trying out Threat Protection Pro. Well, our experience yet again shows that this nifty little feature works extremely well. On iOS and Android, it\u2019s titled \u201cThreat Protection Lite\u201d but is almost the same feature. The best experience is on macOS/Windows.\nIn this scenario, you\u2019ll get three protection levels:\n- Anti-malware\n- Advanced browsing protection\n- Ad and tracker blocker\nThe first is our favorite, as it protects you against malware thanks to real-time scanning. Even better, NordVPN will display blocked threats to showcase its efficiency. We liked the option to exclude certain domains because some sites won\u2019t function with tracking disabled.\nOur team appreciates the URL Cleaner function too. It\u2019s a unique part of Threat Protection Pro that trims web addresses and removes tracking parameters for added privacy. File Protection prevents malicious downloads similarly to Windows Defender.\nIf you don\u2019t prefer Windows Defender and Microsoft\u2019s tracking policies, this is a better alternative in our book. Lastly, Vulnerability Protection (part of anti-malware) detects vulnerable apps on your device by scanning them multiple times a day.\nAs you can see, it detected one during our extensive testing procedure, which we promptly updated afterward.\nNordLynx & NordWhisper VPN Protocols\nThe reason we put NordLynx in this section is because it\u2019s an advanced security protocol you\u2019ll find nowhere else. A proprietary solution like this takes WireGuard as a base and expands upon it to create a superior protocol.\nNordLynx is WireGuard\u2019s improvement in security, privacy, and performance done by NordVPN. This makes the protocol extremely fast and responsive, allowing for second-long connection times for a snappy experience. One of the trademark features, mind you!\nAs you\u2019ll see in our speed test results later on, NordLynx is impressive performance-wise.\nNevertheless, apart from this protocol, the provider includes three more, such as:\n- NordWhisper\n- OpenVPN TCP/UDP\n- IKEv2 (manual setup)\nNordWhisper is the newest protocol made by NordVPN for overcoming network filtering. During our extensive NordVPN review, we found it pretty efficient after testing it on a few censored networks. The protocol selection isn\u2019t the widest but it\u2019s still excellent.\nOpenVPN and IKEv2 are ideal for security while being slower than NordLynx. However, OpenVPN TCP is used by Obfuscated servers to bypass censorship, so it\u2019s pretty handy in many scenarios.\nYou can find more info about NordLynx on NordVPN\u2019s site if you want to explore this reliable protocol.\nDark Web Monitor\nThe Dark Web Monitor tool is another worthy addition. We tested this feature simply by enabling it, and oh boy, we had a few interesting findings. This tool alerts you to public exposure of your data online. By that, we mean data linked to your email and passwords.\nThe app immediately showed us three websites where our data was compromised. For privacy reasons, we can\u2019t show them but we saw info such as our usernames, IP addresses, and passwords. After this NordVPN review, we resolved these issues thanks to this feature.\nMeshnet\nYou do not often find a VPN feature worthy of a separate article. Meshnet is one of them. To be clear, it\u2019s not a security feature but nonetheless, we found it incredibly useful in our NordVPN review. This feature is excellent for file sharing and remote access.\nUsers can link up to 10 personal devices and up to 50 other users\u2019 devices. In doing so, a safe and secure device network can be weaved, where you can share files, remote-control devices, and so on. We like the option to use another device\u2019s IP address.\nLet\u2019s say you want to unblock a restricted site. You can connect to a friend in another country who also uses NordVPN. Once he enables Meshnet, connect to their device and route your traffic through the device\u2019s IP address.\nNow, you can access the site that works in his country but not yours. Meshnet allows for remote access, as said, so that you can fetch a file from another computer or phone too. Oh, one more thing. Meshnet works on ALL supported systems, including iOS and Android.\nThis enables the remote control/access to phones or tablets. Pretty handy if you, let\u2019s say, forget your phone/tablet at home where you have important business files. Our team used Meshnet in this case to transfer these files and have them at our fingertips.\nRAM-Only Servers\nRandom Access Memory, also known as RAM, is a staple of every high-quality provider. Our rich experience showed that RAM-only servers are far better than those based on traditional HDDs. Performance, security, and privacy are elevated significantly.\nNordVPN bases all of its servers on RAM \u2013 quite amazing news! RAM servers wipe their data with each reboot, ensuring nothing is left. We found the provider\u2019s profound understanding of the importance of privacy baffling, which explains why it\u2019s so popular.\nCoupled with a no-log policy, RAM servers are another vital measure that prevents even NordVPN from keeping your private data around.\nPrivate DNS\nThe provider also uses Private DNS servers. Instead of using third-party DNS providers, the provider opts for a proprietary DNS server that adheres to the no-log policy. It means your DNS queries won\u2019t be monitored and stored on the server.\nLet\u2019s compare this to third-party options. Free DNS providers are notorious for storing your DNS requests, so when a VPN uses any of them, it negates its privacy features. Once you connect to NordVPN\u2019s server, your every step online is shrouded in a 100% secure VPN connection.\nNordProtect\nWe left this feature for the end before testing for IP/DNS leaks for a reason. It\u2019s available only in the Prime plan for users in the EU, the UK, the US, Canada, and Switzerland. It\u2019s a third-party tool for removing your private data from brokers\u2019 databases.\nUsers can buy it separately, but we recommend it as part of the Prime plan at under $7/mo for the 24-month plan. NordProtect can remove your private data from 170+ data brokers but this number will increase in the future.\nIf you care deeply about your privacy, it can be handy to wipe out your online footprints more thoroughly.\nIP/DNS Leak Test: No Leaks Detected\nIt couldn\u2019t be clearer that this is one of the top services for overall security. Our NordVPN test also showed the absence of IP and DNS leaks. We connected to a random US server and tested the service using two websites \u2013 ipleak.net and browserleaks.com.\nThe results above show the first website, where the provider completely concealed our original IP/DNS addresses and replaced them with the US counterparts.\nAgain, the second website showcases the same excellent results. Just to be clear, we tested all 118+ countries and had ZERO leaks with NordVPN. However, for the sake of simplicity of this review and test, we included a few screenshots.\nDoes NordVPN Keep Logs?\nDo you want a short or long answer? Here\u2019s the short one \u2013 NO. The provider is based in one of the most privacy-friendly jurisdictions: Panama. We all know Panama as an off-shore location whose privacy laws are way different than those in the US or the UK.\nIt\u2019s a country far away from the 5 Eyes, as well. Nord Security is a reputable company too, unlike Gaditek which owns PureVPN. Judging only by these factors, the provider isn\u2019t forced into storing logs and tracking your online footsteps.\nBut is this truly the case? Let\u2019s review the privacy policy of NordVPN.\nNordVPN\u2019s Privacy Policy Review\nOn its site, the provider claims not to keep any logs. This rings true in the privacy policy too. When it comes to the information that isn\u2019t kept, it includes:\n- IP address\n- DNS requests\n- Browsing history\n- Used bandwidth\n- Traffic logs\nThis is enough to conclude and confirm its no-logs practices. Of course, every provider must store at least something to function properly. When you use NordVPN, it will store your username and a timestamp of the last session status. Justifiably so.\nThis information helps the provider enforce its simultaneous connection limit and is wiped 15 minutes after the connection has stopped. Other stored information includes server load, and anonymized data, such as device information, active subscriptions, and so on.\nNow, using other non-VPN features is another story \u2014 the one we must clarify in this NordVPN review. Threat Protection Pro, for example, must scan visited URLs and apps on your device if you\u2019re using Vulnerability Protection or File Protection.\nThe good news is that the provider doesn\u2019t directly store this information. Instead, it\u2019s either briefly on the server in an anonymized form or isn\u2019t stored at all and is quickly wiped. How can we confirm this, you might be wondering.\nThird-Party Audits\nWith a third-party security audit! NordVPN currently has a few of them, coming from PwC and Deloitte. At the time of testing the service for this NordVPN review, the service counts four of them in 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2023 \u2014 there will likely be more.\nIndependent audits like these are important for trustworthiness. In this case, PwC and Deloitte audited not only a no-log policy but various security features, infrastructure, and so on. With pristine results on its hands, NordVPN is a paramount VPN for overall privacy.\nNordVPN Review: Server Locations\nPeople usually associate the provider\u2019s size with quality. While this isn\u2019t always the case, NordVPN\u2019s larger server fleet indeed brims with reliability and sublime performance. With over 7,600+ servers in 118 countries, it\u2019s hard not to be impressed.\nThe provider uses RAM servers, as explained, but Dedicated IPs are there too. It\u2019s good to have Smart DNS addresses as well. They\u2019re nifty for streaming and let you unblock streaming portals without installing the VPN.\nNordVPN\u2019s server selection is stellar because it covers all continents. For example, you\u2019ll find VPN servers in the UAE, which aren\u2019t present in ExpressVPN. We like the addition of Indian servers, which weren\u2019t there just a few years ago.\nHowever, the provider introduced a handful of virtual servers to ensure it covers \u201cinconvenient\u201d VPN locations. All of this means you\u2019ll never find yourself searching for a VPN location and not finding it. That\u2019s how you make a ubiquitous, worldwide server network.\nSpeed Tests: NordVPN\u2019s Performance Evaluation\nThe user experience with a VPN mostly depends on its performance. Our in-depth NordVPN review contains several speed test results we want to share with you, as we think they\u2019re some of the most brilliant.\nBefore we move on, let us show you our native internet speed in Southeastern Europe (Belgrade):\nOur team tested NordVPN across multiple locations \u2014 near and distant. We also repeated these tests 3 times a day, for 3 days in a row. For convenience, we tested 3 popular locations in Europe (the UK), the US, and Asia (Japan) \u2014 the results are below:\nUK Speed Test Results:\nUS Speed Test Results:\nJapan Speed Test Results:\nAll tests were done using the \u201cAuto\u201d option for protocol selection. We don\u2019t need to analyze the speed test results that much. NordVPN is faster than other providers we tested, displaying an imposing level of performance and low latency across all three locations.\n| UK Server | US Server | Japan Server | |\n| \ud83d\udd3d Download Speed Loss | 5.35% | 14.5% | 34.8% |\n| \ud83d\udd3c Upload Speed Loss | 5% | 6.8% | 9.1% |\nFor convenience, we added a small table that displays NordVPN\u2019s speed losses for each server location in percentages. You can notice just how little the provider loses, even on very distant servers.\nTake Japan as an example \u2014 it\u2019s more than 13,000 kilometers (8,000+ miles) away from our location!\nStreaming & Torrenting With NordVPN\nNordVPN exemplifies a provider whose streaming and torrenting abilities should be top-tier. During our 10-plus-year use, we rarely had any problems in this regard. To ensure this is the case, our team\u2019s NordVPN review meant that we would test it once again for you.\nAs expected, the results were amazing. We managed to access at least 30 Netflix libraries, such as those from the US, the UK, Canada, Japan, and many European catalogs. Platforms like BBC iPlayer and Hotstar also work flawlessly and without buffering.\nStream Content Freely With NordVPN\nThis applies to obfuscated servers too, whose VPN connection masking provides total anonymity necessary to get over certain geo-blocks. We must say it\u2019s superior to CyberGhost and its dedicated streaming servers that can \u201cglitch\u201d and not work occasionally.\nNordVPN sings the same catchy tune in P2P situations. Torrenting is extremely easy. Connect to a P2P server, open your Torrent client, and you\u2019re set. The provider is fast, reliable, and easily configurable so that torrenting is uninterrupted.\nWe need to mention that NordVPN can be bound directly to torrent clients with a SOCKS5 proxy, as explained in this guide. So overall, it\u2019s capable of delivering entertainment to your doorstep with a click of a mouse.\nIf your idea of entertainment is exploring the dark web, you can use its Onion Over VPN servers too. However, even \u201cnormal\u201d servers will work for all your activities.\nUsing NordVPN for Bypassing Censorship\nPeople are quickly deterred from visiting the Great Wall or the Bund because of the Great Firewall. The latter isn\u2019t a popular Chinese monument but rather an annoyance that blocks websites and imposes censorship on the country\u2019s online space.\nPeople use VPNs in this country but to no avail, as most don\u2019t work. Thanks to our numerous testers in China, our team discovered that NordVPN works in 2025. Its Obfuscated servers are powerful enough to bypass deep-packet inspection and provide unlimited internet access.\nBetter yet, NordVPN\u2019s speeds in China are stable and fast. Another point for NordVPN is its ability to work in other censored regions. After trying out this provider in the UAE, Turkey, Qatar, Russia, and other countries, we found that it works without a hitch.\nBrowse the Internet Freely With NordVPN\nCustomer Support\nDid you know that NordVPN is the largest VPN company right now? Well, a part of its gargantuan budget is devoted to staggering customer service, which we must praise in this NordVPN review for 2025. What can you expect? 24/7 live chat support, for example!\nIt\u2019s there for you at any moment, showcasing helpfulness and user-friendliness. Email support is another option and might we add, it\u2019s VERY quick to respond. The company is ever-present on YouTube and other social networks for added accessibility.\nIf you\u2019re shy and avoid communication like a proper introvert, don\u2019t panic. FAQs and guides are on the site, explaining everything you\u2019ll want to know. We especially like its setup tutorials for every device under the big yellow ball called Sun.\nYou\u2019ll learn how to install a VPN on your iPhone, router, PlayStation, and so on. With multiple support channels across different platforms, NordVPN will gladly and swiftly solve any problems you might have as a newcomer.\nNordVPN Review: The Final Verdict\nWith this in-depth review of NordVPN coming to an end, we\u2019ll gladly digress on the analysis we performed. This is a great all-around service whose improvements never cease to amaze new and existing users. Recent improvements, in particular, made it much better.\nNordVPN\u2019s status as the most powerful provider is justifiable. It offers top-tier performance, unbeatable privacy and security, excellent compatibility, plenty of server locations, and state-of-the-art streaming/torrenting abilities.\nWhat are its shortcomings?\nTo be 100% honest, there aren\u2019t many. We dislike the lack of website split tunneling, for instance. New users complain about NordVPN\u2019s complexity, which can be the case for first-time users who find the feature-filled apps a tad overwhelming.\nSome users reported occasional connection issues on Windows and macOS. For us, that was rarely the case. Curiosity was also a security breach in 2018 on one server, which the provider patched promptly without consequences, receiving multiple third-party audits shortly after.\nSo, after this comprehensive review of NordVPN, only one question remains.\nShould you buy and use NordVPN? Our team confidently says yes."

      "text": "You\u2019ve come here to find out how to watch Pornhub in Texas for obvious reasons. Like most users, you are infuriated by the Texas Pornhub ban that started in March of 2024. The new age verification law prevents underage users in this state from watching multiple porn sites, including xHamster, Spankbang, and even YouPorn.\nHowever, it\u2019s not only about underage people. While age verification can protect children from adultery, it also negatively influences privacy because it requires sensitive information. Pornhub doesn\u2019t like this and because age verification requires additional effort on its side to implement, it decided to remove its presence from Texas.\nTo be clear, you CAN\u2019T watch Pornhub in Texas even as an adult. We believe this news struck you like a 10-ton truck but you should be happy to be here. We\u2019ll guide you through the steps required to access Pornhub in Texas and consequently watch every other porn site.\nHow to watch porn (and Pornhub) in Texas with a VPN: quick summary\nIn a hurry and don\u2019t want to read the entire article to learn how to bypass the porn ban and access sites like Pornhub in Texas? Here\u2019s a quick step-by-step summary:\n- Select and purchase a VPN with servers in multiple US states and countries around the world. Our recommendation is NordVPN, which is very reliable. Note that there is currently a discount on all its 2-year plans (and a 30-day money-back guarantee).\n- Download and install the VPN app on the device of your choice.\n- Open the app and enable VPN protection by connecting to a server outside of Texas (the closer, the better).\n- Watch Pornhub or any other porn site freely in Texas. Say goodbye to age verification or informational messages preventing you from accessing them.\nWhy Is Pornhub Banned in Texas?\nBefore we explain how to watch Pornhub in Texas, we need to discuss the reason for its ban. Specifically, the USA is known for its free internet and minimal censorship, which means porn and adult content in general are legal.\nSo what\u2019s the problem?\nThe problem lies in the age verification law whose implementation started in 2023. This state passed House Bill 1181, which consequently made it one of the American states that require age verification to access porn sites.\nIn short, all people who want to watch pornography or any form of explicit and obscene content must verify that they\u2019re 18 or above.\nTo do that, they need to provide a government-issued ID. In addition, all porn sites that want to operate in Texas MUST implement this age verification part, otherwise, they could be charged millions of dollars if they allow underage people to access their content.\nPornhub reacted to this with a self-ban. Because age verification requires a large piece of your sensitive data (government-issued ID) and Pornhub nourishes users\u2019 anonymity and privacy, the platform decided to call it quits and block access to users in Texas.\nThe entire \u201cbattle\u201d between Texas authorities and Pornhub lasted for pretty much a year until Pornhub\u2019s final stand in March 2024. Since then, users can\u2019t watch Pornhub in Texas, which has infuriated many who can\u2019t access it, as well as many other porn sites.\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to understand Pornhub\u2019s way of thinking. The platform\u2019s ban was ultimately down to users\u2019 privacy and respect for its wide audience. Thankfully, this tragic story has a good end because you can still unblock Pornhub in Texas with the trick below.\nHow to Watch Pornhub in Texas (Works in 2025)\nWebsite blocks function fairly simply:\n- First, you try to visit the website.\n- The website reads your IP address.\n- If the IP address is in the country/state where it won\u2019t work, you can\u2019t access it. If the IP address is from the country where the website works, you CAN access it.\nThe same applies to Pornhub. Users in Texas who visit this website will receive the error message displayed above that highlights everything we said. By explaining this problem, we also explained how to watch Pornhub in Texas and unblock this porn site.\nBy changing your IP address to another state or country \u2013 voila!\nTo alter your IP address and ensure you can unblock Pornhub in seconds, you\u2019ll need a VPN service. VPNs are optimized for streaming and unblocking content because they offer thousands of servers in hundreds of worldwide countries. Moreover, they\u2019re built for privacy and safety.\nThis means accessing Pornhub in Texas will be under strong encryption and the VPN\u2019s no-log policy. Both ensure you can\u2019t be tracked online, which prevents ISPs and authorities from spying on you and seeing you\u2019re enjoying your time watching some adult action.\nOur experience shows that NordVPN is a perfect pick for this purpose. It offers ample servers, unlimited bandwidth, fast speeds, and an audited no-logs policy. Essentially, you have everything you need to unblock porn sites in Texas and watch Pornhub in seconds.\nSubscribing to a VPN\nWe\u2019ll use NordVPN for this guide, but you can use any other provider with the same level of quality (ExpressVPN and Private Internet Access come to mind). They are all reliable VPNs for Pornhub.\nThe first step \u2013 and there are only two \u2013 is to set up a VPN. Simply click the button below to go to NordVPN\u2019s site and subscribe. Not sure how?\nSelect the plan (preferably a 2-year deal with a 70% discount), enter your email address, and pay for the thing. Now go to your email client, confirm your account, and make a secure password. Congrats. It\u2019s time to download NordVPN to your device \u2013 PC, tablet, smartphone, or Smart TV \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter, the VPN works on all of them.\nOnce you open the application, log in with the provided email and password from a minute ago and the dashboard will open. Isn\u2019t it splendid?\nUnblocking Pornhub in Texas\nIt\u2019s time to watch Pornhub in Texas but first, you need to connect to a VPN server outside of this state. Beware that other states in the USA also struggle with access to Pornhub, such as Virginia, Nebraska, Utah, and so on. That said, we don\u2019t recommend using US VPN servers at all.\nInstead, go for European servers. Countries like Spain, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and others have no issues watching Pornhub. The screenshot below shows exactly what we said \u2013 the Dutch server working with this porn site exquisitely.\nOnce you connect to it, you can access Pornhub in Texas without age verification and other fluff.\nCan I Access Pornhub in Texas for Free?\nThe reason we used NordVPN is because it\u2019s an all-around VPN for streaming, security, and other good stuff. If you want to access Pornhub in Texas for free, and by that, we mean with a free VPN, you\u2019ll perhaps succeed but not fully. Free VPNs have a few limitations we must point out.\nThey don\u2019t have many servers to begin with. Smaller server parks often mean overcrowding, which results in slower connections and instabilities. Some free VPNs can\u2019t unblock Pornhub at all because they\u2019re limited only to a few US servers \u2013 Hotspot Shield is a prime example.\nOur ranking of solid free VPNs also covered various bandwidth limits. Hotspot Shield limits you to 500 MB daily, which won\u2019t be enough for 2-3 minutes of porn in Full HD. While Windscribe\u2019s 10 GB monthly is better, it\u2019s far from enough for even the least demanding user.\nSome free providers like Hola, Urban VPN, and a few more also resort to storing logs and not caring a bit about your privacy. This is quite dangerous because these logs often end up in data brokers\u2019 hands who can sell them to the US government and make a huge profit.\nWhile they profit, you\u2019re bound to pay a fine for watching Pornhub in Texas or, let\u2019s say, accidentally downloading a copyrighted torrent file. If you want to watch Pornhub in Texas for free, the best way to go about it is NordVPN and its free trial or money-back guarantee.\nThe provider has a 7-day free trial and if you pay for it, you get 30 days to request a refund if you don\u2019t want to use it anymore. Combined, they offer up to 37 days of free Pornhub watching in Texas once you get a refund. Relying on free VPNs gets you nowhere.\nPorn Sites Allowed in Texas in 2025\nPornhub is just a small drop in the sea of porn site blocks in Texas. Unfortunately, the age verification law impacted access to other adult websites that are either completely blocked or require age verification.\nHere\u2019s a table that tells you more about the porn sites allowed in Texas at the moment:\n| Allowed in Texas? | Age Verification | |\n| Pornhub | \u274c | \u274c |\n| Xvideos | \u2705 | \u274c |\n| XNXX | \u2705 | \u274c |\n| xHamster | \u2705 | \u2705 |\n| RedTube | \u274c | \u274c |\n| Brazzers | \u274c | \u274c |\n| YouPorn | \u274c | \u274c |\n| SpankBang | \u2705 | \u274c |\n| Chaturbate | \u2705 | \u2705 |\n| Stripchat | \u2705 | \u2705 |\nAs you can see, most porn sites are allowed in Texas but they require age verification to work. The only sites we found that works without it are XNXX and Xvideos. You can simply press \u201cYes\u201d when asked if you\u2019re over 18 and you\u2019re good to go. We don\u2019t know if this will change.\nxHamster, for example, also works, but you must verify your age using a government-issued ID. Chaturbate\u2019s age verification is less strict but still must be completed to access the website. If you don\u2019t want to use a VPN or verify your age, Xvideos and XNXX are currently the best options to consider.\nIf you want to access Pornhub, RedTube, Brazzers, and others, using NordVPN or any other eligible VPN will be necessary. This way, you can unblock porn sites in Texas AND avoid age verification, striking two flies with one hit.\nIs It Legal to Watch Porn in Texas?\nMuslim countries are notorious for anti-porn laws that prohibit watching and distributing such material. Fortunately for the USA and people in Texas, porn IS legal and you won\u2019t face any problems if you watch this content. Now, there\u2019s a catch \u2013 it\u2019s legal for people over 18.\nThis is why the age verification law has become prevalent in recent years. To be clear, our team doesn\u2019t condone watching pornography if you\u2019re underage. It\u2019s not the best thing to do and definitely not legal in Texas and many other countries. This applies to watching Pornhub in Texas with a VPN.\nIf you\u2019re underage, it\u2019s technically illegal to watch porn in Texas, even while using a VPN service. Just because no one sees you unblocking Pornhub, XNXX, or any other site, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s fully justified and legal. The new age verification law has another clause, which we found interesting.\nNamely, porn sites that operate in Texas can be fined if they violate age verification and allow underage people to access their content. There\u2019s a civil penalty of around $10,000 for this violation and if a minor gets on the site unauthorized, the site will have to pay $2,500.\nPornhub Thinks I\u2019m in Texas: What Can I Do?\nUsers who try to watch Pornhub outside this state frequently report that the site sees them as if they were in Texas. We\u2019ve heard reports of this problem ample times and it usually comes from people in the United States, with an American IP address from a neighboring state.\nTake Arkansas and Louisiana as examples. These states are very close to Texas so your ISP might\u2019ve assigned you an IP address associated with these states. This happens many times in other countries. For instance, if you live in Berlin, checking your IP address online might reveal a different location \u2013 another nearby city, let\u2019s say.\nAnother reason this problem appears is using a VPN that instantly connects to Texas. Some providers \u2013 mainly free \u2013 don\u2019t have many servers and they might be using Texas when you connect to the United States. You can remedy this by using another provider that covers more American states and allows for a greater degree of freedom.\nPrivate Internet Access covers all 51 states and is great for watching Pornhub in Texas. It\u2019s simultaneously suitable for Netflix access and watching the US library.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we don\u2019t think the new age verification law will subside soon. It\u2019s a \u201cfresh\u201d thing, exacerbated by the fact that new American states are affected by it daily. Texas, Arkansas, Utah, and many others suffer the same fate, so you\u2019re not alone.\nThe best and the only thing you can do right now is unblock and watch Pornhub in Texas with a VPN service. By switching your IP to a completely different location, you can get rid of restrictions and revel in porn sites without verifying your age and other inconveniences.\nNordVPN seems to be the best overall but our team advises trying ExpressVPN or Private Internet Access if you don\u2019t like our go-to option. Now go ahead, give it a shot, and you\u2019ll likely be impressed with the outcome of being able to watch Pornhub in Texas in seconds!"

      "text": "If you\u2019re struggling with geo-blocks or firewall restrictions, you might be wondering how to unblock websites. Let\u2019s face it. We all deal with website blocks. They\u2019re annoying, discouraging, and downright unsolvable. At least at first. Luckily, no problem is unsolvable.\nYou see, you can unblock websites and access them no matter the circumstance. Sometimes, a website is blocked because of a geo-restriction. In other cases, a website block can be a result of law compliance, censorship, workplace/school policy, or something else entirely.\nThe best option to unblock websites in 2025 is with a VPN. However, this guide will review many other options that might be helpful. Let\u2019s go through them and see how they can help you overcome restrictions and have any site at your fingertips.\nUnblock Websites With a VPN: The Best Overall Solution\nHaving tried multiple methods (explained below), our team determined that using a VPN works the best. Not sure how a VPN works? Check out this guide. In short, this service lets you connect to an intermediary server located in another country.\nAs a result, your traffic is routed to that server, where you\u2019re assigned its IP address. With your IP address now changed, any website you visit will see that IP instead of the original one. This, in turn, lets you bypass geo-blocks and unblock websites promptly.\nWhile website blocks have different reasons explained later in the guide, most if not ALL of them can be resolved with an IP address change. This is why VPNs work so well. They can not only change your IP address but also provide additional security to prevent your IP address from leaking.\nThis is how many people access restricted gambling sites, Netflix catalogs, adult platforms, and much more. As this is the #1 method to unblock websites effectively, we\u2019ll explain how to use a VPN first, and then, we\u2019ll discuss alternative but less effective methods.\nBear in mind that VPNs work on all platforms and devices. The following guide won\u2019t apply only to PC users but also to those on iOS/Android phones, tablets, laptops, and even Smart TVs. This is, again, why VPNs work so well if you\u2019re struggling with site blocks.\nHow to Use a VPN to Unblock Sites?\nIn theory, all VPNs work the same but in practice, it\u2019s far from that. While all VPNs can unblock some sites, not all of them can unblock a whole lot. NordVPN seems to be the absolute best option in our experience.\nWhy? Well, it offers servers in 111 countries.\nIt\u2019s also a worthy site unblocker with special optimization for this purpose. It\u2019s no wonder many use it to binge on Netflix and BBC iPlayer and alleviate censorship. Coupled with top-tier security, strong privacy, unlimited bandwidth, and the fastest speeds, it\u2019s an amazing choice.\nHere\u2019s how to unblock a website you want with a VPN.\n1. Set Up a VPN Service\nSetting up a VPN is a major step. You\u2019ll need a subscription which you can get below. Click the button and you\u2019ll be taken straight to NordVPN\u2019s site. You can now pick a discounted 2-year plan at just over $3 a month or select any other deal you find suitable.\nClick the plan you want, enter your email, and pay using one of many payment methods. From here, you\u2019ll need to verify your account through the provided email, make a password, and download the VPN. Once that is done, install the VPN on your device.\nAfter signing in with your email and password, the VPN\u2019s dashboard will open.\n2. Connect to a Server\nYou\u2019ll need to connect to a server to unblock a website. For this scenario, we\u2019ll use the Australian TV channel called 10play. We\u2019re in Europe but 10play works exclusively in Australia. The same could be said about 9Now and other Australian TV channels.\nNevertheless, we\u2019ll need an IP adress from this country to access the channel. To get it, simply connect to the VPN server in Australia. Open the server list, find the country, click or tap once on it, and you\u2019re set. NordVPN\u2019s \u201cConnected\u201d message will appear up top.\n3. Visit the Website You Wanted\nAfter the connection is established, you can try to visit the inaccessible website and see if it now works. In our case, 10play worked like a charm, which can be seen in the screenshot below. We not only unblocked it but also watched many of its content.\nHowever, this is just one example of a foreign TV channel. You can use NordVPN to unblock websites with different content or even completely different types of websites. From gambling and betting to porn, streaming, and gaming platforms \u2013 you can access them all.\nIn many cases, connecting to a server in your own country will suffice. In fact, simply encrypting your internet traffic with a VPN allows you to unblock sites that are restricted by firewalls (whether in your school, office, etc.).\nOther Methods to Unblock a Website in 2025\nEverything comes at a cost, so if you don\u2019t want to pay for a VPN, does it mean you won\u2019t be able to unblock the site you want? Not necessarily. As explained, a VPN will work wonderfully but it costs money, although not a lot compared to paid proxy services.\nIf you can\u2019t pay for this service or you simply refuse to, we\u2019ll explore other solutions to access a blocked website.\nUsing a Proxy Service\nA popular method of unblocking a site is using a proxy. By this, we don\u2019t mean paid proxies like Bright Data, Oxylabs, and others. These are way too expensive and made for different purposes, one of which is scraping. We think mostly about open proxies like this:\nThis is Hide.me Proxy, a 100% free option that you can use without installation. Simply go to the website, select one of the three proxy locations, and input the domain address you want to visit. Click on Go and see if you can unblock the website you want.\nProxies are far different than VPNs, however. They don\u2019t have encryption and don\u2019t use tunneling like VPNs. Even worse, they\u2019re unoptimized for, let\u2019s say, unblocking streaming sites, and will only work in mild cases of censorship and school/workplace restrictions.\nBear in mind that schools and workplaces will often block proxy sites, making them unusable. In addition, proxies lack security features and free options (not Hide.me) tend to track your online activities and collect sensitive information about you.\nProxies can be extremely slow, displaying just a bare minimum of performance. Don\u2019t get your hopes up. Proxies can\u2019t always unblock websites, so in many instances, they simply won\u2019t work, making VPNs a superior option overall.\nAccess websites freely with NordVPN\nRouting Your Traffic Through Tor\nTor is a great and pretty much the only way to access the dark web. We explained how to go on the dark web in privacy and Tor Browser is an integral part. However, it can also be used as a website unblocked if the reason for blocking lies in IP blacklisting.\nTor functions by routing your connection through its many nodes or servers handled by volunteers worldwide. In this process, your IP address is hidden and the connection becomes encrypted. The entry node encrypts the connection and it is decrypted at the exit node.\nIf your IP address has been banned from the site, Tor will hide it and make the request to visit the website look like it originates from another machine. Tor, however, doesn\u2019t let you select the location like VPNs, so it\u2019s a poor option for geo-restrictions. It doesn\u2019t end there.\nThis browser is VERY slow because of the level of encryption and \u201cbouncing\u201d your traffic through multiple nodes. Not to mention it\u2019s not as \u201canonymous\u201d as it claims to be because its nodes can be compromised, in which case, you can be exposed.\nUsing an IP Address Instead of a Website URL\nHow to unblock websites without special software? Well, you can go for the very old trick and try to get on the site through its IP rather than the URL. Schools, workplaces, and other institutions can block only specific URLs but leave out IP addresses.\nThis is rather stupid on their side but it will let you capitalize on it by using the IP of the website. To clarify things, every website has its IP address, which is a unique sequence of numbers assigned to each website. The problem is how to find the IP address.\nWell, it\u2019s simple:\n- Open the Command Prompt on your computer (as an administrator)\n- Type in \u201cping\u201d and then enter the name of the website (example of a command \u201cping facebook.com\u201c).\n- Press Enter and the IP address of the website will appear.\nWith this IP address in your hands, copy and paste it into the browser window and see if you can unblock the site. There are other ways to detect an IP of the domain. macOS users will need to use the Terminal and the \u201ctraceroute\u201d command, for instance.\nLinux users can use the \u201cdig websitename.com\u201d command instead.\nClearing the Website Data (Works on Chrome)\nSome people want to know how to unblock websites on Chrome. The trick that they can perform is to clear the website data, which consequently works on Brave and other Chromium browsers. How does this help? It returns the site to its original state.\nThis, in turn, makes it as if you were visiting the site for the first time, wiping all cookies, cache, and other data accumulated in your device. To unblock a website on Chrome, you\u2019ll need to follow these few steps:\n- Open Google Chrome.\n- Go to Settings.\n- Click on \u201cPrivacy and Security\u201d and select \u201cSite Settings.\u201c\n- Go to \u201cView permissions and data stored across sites.\u201c\n- Find the website you want to unblock and click on the Trash icon next to it.\n- When the prompt appears, click \u201cDelete\u201d to remove all permissions and site data.\n- Go to the website now and see if it works.\nUnblocking websites on Chrome also works on its mobile versions, so you can follow this guide even if you aren\u2019t a PC user. We want to quickly mention that you can use a VPN for Chrome and not have to perform this solution. VPNs have their browser extensions.\nThey can be installed directly on the browser and help you unblock websites easily. NordVPN and ExpressVPN, in particular, have the best extensions that work like full-on VPNs and unblock websites the same way, helping you bypass even geo-restrictions.\nClearing the website data, unfortunately, works only on non-geo-blocked websites.\nTry Using Cached Versions of Websites\nIf you\u2019re trying to access a restricted domain without success, we suggest going for its cached version. This domain version is stored on Google\u2019s temporary storage. The solution is simple. Before you enter the URL, type in \u201ccached:\u201d and you\u2019re good to go.\nHere\u2019s an example; cached:www.facebook.com.\nAfter you enter the domain address this way, press Enter and it should work. As this is a cached version of the site, it might not work as the current version, so don\u2019t be shocked if it\u2019s slower, looks altered, or is missing some of its crucial elements.\nVisiting a Website Through Google Translate\nGoogle Translate is handy if you\u2019re having trouble with foreign languages but that\u2019s not all! This capable translator can help you unblock websites, which, at first, sounds silly. In practice, this solution works relatively well unless we\u2019re talking about, of course, geo-blocks.\nOpen Google Translate and type in the domain of the website in the left text box. In the Translation box, which is on the right, will appear the hyperlink of the domain. Click on it and you should be able to visit the website. It\u2019s far from perfect, though.\nThe website quality will be poor and you won\u2019t get the experience you want. We noticed that some websites display only text instead of their full page. Pages can be in disarray and missing elements, so links and buttons will not work.\nWe think this method of unblocking websites is useful only if you need to extract information from them. In some cases, seeing only text is enough to fetch the information you need and move on. If not\u2026 well, we go back to our VPN recommendation from before.\nWhy Are Websites Blocked?\nNothing happens without a good reason. This clever phrase can be applied to website blocks and restrictions that we frequently encounter. Let\u2019s explain the most typical reasons for not being able to access the website.\nGeo-Restrictions\nNot being able to use Netflix, BBC, Hotstar, and other streaming services comes as a result of geo-blocks. As the name implies, this means the website is restricted only to specific regions or one region, while the rest are not allowed to access it.\nHere\u2019s an example:\nThis happens because of licenses and copyright agreements that allow the site to operate only in specific regions. Netflix is a good example. It doesn\u2019t own all of its content and most belong to copyright holders. These companies decide where the content will be accessible.\nFor example, if a movie is owned by a company that doesn\u2019t want it broadcast to Germany, people in this country won\u2019t be able to watch it on Netflix. Netflix has its own \u201cOriginals\u201d that represent titles owned by the company and they\u2019re available worldwide.\nYou won\u2019t have to change your Netflix region to watch them. Geo-restrictions can ONLY be overcome with a VPN \u2013 no other solution works. They allow you to switch your IP to another location, pretend that you\u2019re there, and unblock websites that are region-locked.\nISP Blocking\nISPs have total control over your internet experience. They can use bandwidth throttling to deter you from gaming, torrenting, streaming, and so forth. In the same fashion, they can block websites to prevent bandwidth congestion and enforce their proprietary apps.\nFor example, ISPs offer their apps for streaming that you need to pay for. If you use Netflix, your money doesn\u2019t fill their pockets and they\u2019ll intentionally throttle all bandwidth spent on Netflix, making the streaming experience choppy and laggy.\nIn some cases, they can completely block websites and VoIP services. People use VPNs in the UAE to enjoy Skype, WhatsApp, Viber, and other free messaging apps for this reason.\nCensorship & Legal Reasons\nCensorship and legal reasons are often combined in many countries. China, Turkey, Russia, Belarus, and many other countries block websites that counter their political or religious beliefs. Censorship is a serious issue in 2025 and makes the internet extremely limited.\nChina blocks all Google services, social media, YouTube, and all mainstream sites, leaving you with nothing but crumbs. Some countries block porn, while others restrict access to anti-religious content found on some platforms. The same can happen in reverse.\nWebsites can use self-blocking in specific countries to adhere to legislation. That was the case with PornHub, which self-restricted access to its site to people in Texas. If you are in a country or state where the site is inaccessible, we recommend reading our selection of the best VPNs for Pornhub.\nSchool & Workplace Policies\nUnblocking websites at school and the workplace is often a primary interest for internet users. However, we understand that restricting certain sites is sensible. After all, you\u2019re at school to learn, not to juggle between Facebook and TikTok.\nConversely, your workplace should be a place to work and earn your keep and not have fun all the time. This is why gaming sites, social media platforms, and adult portals aren\u2019t allowed in these places. Schools and companies don\u2019t want you to be distracted \u2013 understandably.\nIf you ever need to access a site blocked by your school, feel free to check out our list of the best VPNs for school.\nIs It Legal to Unblock Websites?\nWhile a VPN and other tricks can help you access restricted sites, some wonder if this is the right call. We discussed the VPN legality in a separate guide where we explained that this service is usually legal in most countries. By most, we mean more than 90%.\nHowever, the legality of this service is valid unless you use it to perform illicit online activities. Downloading copyrighted torrents, despite the VPN\u2019s ability to conceal this activity, is still illegal. It\u2019s like murdering someone and not getting caught.\nThis still means you\u2019ve performed something you shouldn\u2019t. Unblocking websites at school, bypassing geo-blocks, and circumventing censorship are benign and usually won\u2019t get you in trouble. It will, however, go against certain policies and rules.\nNetflix has an anti-VPN policy that forbids the use of IP-changing tools to access its region-locked content. However, no one landed in jail for watching Netflix with a VPN. One thing to worry about is your country\u2019s legislation, which might differ if the country is more \u201cstrict.\u201d\nFor example, many countries deem gambling illegal, so if you unblock a website like Betfair or a random online casino, it\u2019s against the law. Many Muslim countries don\u2019t allow pornography, so again, watching PornHub there will be law-unfriendly.\nBefore you unblock a website of a sensitive nature (excluding Netflix and most streaming sites), inform yourself about your country\u2019s laws and legislation. If the site is illegal in your country, don\u2019t do it and fully respect the laws put in place. They\u2019re there for a reason!\nFinal Words\nDespite the type of website block, a VPN remains the most dependable option to get over it. This especially applies to geo-restrictions that can only be circumvented with a Virtual Private Network. Other restrictions can sometimes be remedied with alternatives.\nProxies can help you unblock websites at school, while Tor gives access to otherwise restricted Onion domains. Other methods might work for you as well but they\u2019re way less effective and aren\u2019t guaranteed to always work.\nAs for the VPN, we also gave you a few choices. NordVPN tops the list as the best overall option, but ExpressVPN and even Private Internet Access should fit the bill. Their large server networks can help you change your IP and unblock websites in seconds."

We cherry-picked the providers that performed the best in our tests and took their risk-free offers that you can try right away. Let\u2019s see why they\u2019re so popular and why you should give them a go.\n1. NordVPN\nPros\n- Affordable subscription plans\n- Over 6,400 worldwide servers\n- Double VPN adds another encryption layer\n- Obfuscation to avoid censorship\n- Unlimited bandwidth\n- Audited no-logs policy\nCons\n- You need an Android device to sign up for a free trial\n- Credit card information is required\nThe list is kicked off by NordVPN as the best free trial VPN deal you can get. Above all, this is our favorite provider that excels in every category, from speed to security and privacy.\nNordVPN\u2019s deal is simple. You can obtain its 7-day free trial if you sign up on your Android phone or tablet. Does this mean you can use the VPN only on Android? No!\nOnce you sign up for a trial, you can use it on ALL other devices and connect up to 10 of them simultaneously! NordVPN lets you access its premium features and enjoy unlimited bandwidth for streaming, torrenting, gaming, or browsing the internet indefinitely.\nIf you decide to pay for it, there\u2019s another great benefit \u2013 a 30-day money-back guarantee. This is the refund period that you can use to be reimbursed and still not lose a penny. NordVPN comes with over 6,400 servers, the fastest speeds, and a credible no-log policy.\nThis provider\u2019s Double VPN servers are famous for top-tier security, while its obfuscation allows it to be used in China. Threat Protection is enjoyed by many for its prowess in removing malware, ads, and trackers, ensuring a clean and enjoyable internet experience on all devices.\nIf that\u2019s not enough, your NordVPN free trial gets you hundreds of P2P servers for unlimited torrenting. Even better, NordVPN includes Meshnet to aid file sharing and remote access to up to sixty other devices. This is an all-around VPN that doesn\u2019t skimp on any features.\nYou can use it even on Firestick, routers, gaming consoles, or any other internet-capable device. If you decide to use it in the long run, which is smart, you\u2019ll find its 2-year plan with a 70% price reduction attractive. It makes NordVPN cost just over $3 a month.\n2. ExpressVPN\nPros\n- Free trial + money-back guarantee for all plans\n- Advanced Protection blocks ads and trackers\n- Network Lock (kill switch)\n- Smart DNS (MediaStreamer) support\n- Great for bypassing geo-restrictions\n- Dozens of third-party security audits\nCons\n- Not the cheapest premium plans\n- It doesn\u2019t offer a free plan\nSo, ExpressVPN is known for its slightly higher prices but that\u2019s why you have this VPN free trial. It\u2019s even simpler in this case. Again, you\u2019re getting a 7-day trial if you register not only on Android but iOS as well. iPhone VPN users can effortlessly obtain a trial and enjoy.\nIf they don\u2019t want to cancel it, ExpressVPN will charge them but there\u2019s an insurance \u2013 a 30-day money-back guarantee. That\u2019s right, you can again enjoy this premium provider and be refunded in a month. ExpressVPN is similar in terms of security, performance, and privacy.\nThe provider uses RAM servers and Private DNS, keeping all your sensitive data shrouded. With over 18 third-party audits, it\u2019s not strange that millions trust it. ExpressVPN covers all devices with its native, good-looking apps capable of great things. Streaming is one of them.\nOur tests have shown its ability to unblock Netflix and sports-streaming channels. For instance, it\u2019s often a choice to watch F1 races online. In addition, ExpressVPN\u2019s inclusion of the Network Lock (its kill switch) is handy to keep IP leaks at bay and works like a charm.\nThe Lightway protocol boosts the performance and ensures much-needed connection stability. As one of the best VPN free trials in 2025, ExpressVPN offers advanced tools such as Advanced Protection for tracker removal and Parental Control for blocking porn sites.\nExpressVPN\u2019s pricing model isn\u2019t the definition of flexibility. If you\u2019re thinking about the premium route, NordVPN\u2019s price is much more approachable. But if you really like this free VPN trial, consider its annual plan with a 49% discount thanks to 3 free months.\n3. Private Internet Access\nPros\n- 256-bit GCM encryption\n- Dedicated IP addresses\n- MultiHop connection support\n- No-logging policy proven in court\n- WireGuard VPN protocol\nCons\n- It could be a bit faster\n- Not impressive to unblock Netflix catalogs\nPIA is already very affordable at $2 or so a month, making this VPN-free trial even greater. You can obtain this provider\u2019s 7-day by registering on iOS or Android the same way you did with ExpressVPN. A 30-day refund policy is there too, allowing for reimbursements down the line if you want to use it for longer than 7 days.\nPrivate Internet Access has a wealth of features you\u2019ll like to explore. One of them is MultiHop paired with Shadowsocks which adds obfuscation. These two provide ample security, along with 256-bit GCM encryption that works in the background, keeping things private.\nMany users love PIA for offering servers in all 51 American states. This makes it ideal to watch Netflix US and access ample American content anywhere. On top of that, the provider\u2019s performance is decent, and while certainly not groundbreaking, its speeds will surely scratch your itch.\nThis provider is no stranger to privacy, as it\u2019s one of the safest VPNs whose no-log policy has been verified in court plenty of times. We found its PIA MACE feature to work well as an anti-tracker tool and the VPN packs reliable protocols like WireGuard and OpenVPN.\nPrivate Internet Access has a few optional extras we like. For example, you can get an antivirus for just $1 a month \u2013 cheaper than your breakfast. Then, there\u2019s a selection of dedicated IP addresses to aid in bypassing the captcha and preventing IP blacklisting.\nPrivate Internet Access is an amazing VPN free trial offer thanks to unlimited concurrent connections. This goes ideally with its apps for all devices, 24/7 live chat support, and stellar streaming abilities for Netflix and BBC iPlayer. Asking for more would be ungrateful.\n4. Proton VPN\nPros\n- Unlimited torrenting\n- It offers a free plan with unlimited bandwidth\n- IPv6 and DNS leak protection\n- Secure Core servers\n- Split Tunneling\nCons\n- Stealth VPN on macOS only\n- Expensive overall\n- No Smart DNS\nProton VPN built its reputation brick by brick as the most reliable European VPN. Based in Swiss, Proton VPN governs a robust server fleet and Secure Core servers that represent the peak of VPN technology. But what about its free trial? It doesn\u2019t have one \u2013 there\u2019s something better instead. A free plan.\nYes, users can sign up for a free plan and enjoy unlimited bandwidth, a couple of server locations, and rock-solid security. This is far from its premium plan but still a nice way to test the service before buying it. Best of all, it doesn\u2019t require payment information.\nProton VPN\u2019s premium plan is far ahead and luckily, has a 30-day refund policy if you\u2019re getting it. The provider\u2019s security is characterized by WireGuard, IPv6 leak protection, and RAM-based servers in about 100 countries. Proton VPN doesn\u2019t keep logs either.\nIts minimal logging practices pushed it far above its competitors and among the top options for overall privacy. Proton VPN\u2019s apps span all systems, with 10 simultaneous connections. Its apps are also optimized for P2P, streaming, and Tor connections for dark web access.\nThe lack of a free trial doesn\u2019t hurt the experience you\u2019ll get. After all, Proton\u2019s intelligently crafted apps include everything you need. From split tunneling and kill switch to Stealth VPN on macOS and VPN Accelerator to give the performance a slight push to the back.\nDespite not having a proper free trial, Proton VPN\u2019s 30-day refund policy is great if you want a glimpse of its premium features. Keep in mind its slightly higher price even for long-term plans that many users refuse to pay. Well, you can be the exception.\n5. Surfshark\nPros\n- Unlimited concurrent connections\n- IP Rotation feature\n- Reliable Netflix unblocking\n- NoBorders helps to avoid censorship in China\nCons\n- No discounts on its monthly plans\n- Based in the Netherlands (a 9 Eyes country)\n- The cheapest plan lacks antivirus\nSurfshark offers a phenomenal free trial deal that you\u2019ll surely want to test. This already affordable provider has 7 days for testing that can be claimed on iOS, Android, and macOS devices. Of course, you get your 30-day money-back guarantee if you decide to pay afterward.\nWe love this provider because of its overall excellent security, strong privacy, and versatility. For instance, it\u2019s very effective at unblocking Netflix catalogs, which is why many use it for streaming. Another benefit is speed, which is drastically improved with the inclusion of WireGuard.\nThis provider isn\u2019t a slouch in terms of features. In particular, its MultiHop support is a selling point but you can also enjoy IP Rotation, a kill switch, a CleanWeb ad blocker, and NoBorders to successfully overcome censorship in China. Now, this provider is stationed in the Netherlands, which is disliked by many.\nThe good news is that it\u2019s still a revered no-log service. Surfshark showcased impressive privacy in our test, as it\u2019s also audited multiple times by big security firms. This free trial VPN offers unlimited concurrent connections and can be installed on any device \u2013 you name it.\nIts One+ plan includes bonuses like an antivirus and even Search \u2013 an incognito browser for anonymous online adventures. It\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s a tad slower than NordVPN and its kill switch had some issues in the past. Thankfully, that\u2019s rectified in 2025.\nBesides, it\u2019s one of the most useful providers because of its many features. We haven\u2019t mentioned dedicated/static IPs, Smart DNS, a dark web monitor, and many others. Get a free trial on this VPN, test it, and see if you like it. We\u2019re confident you will.\n6. CyberGhost\nPros\n- 24-hour free trial on Windows/Mac (no credit card)\n- The 45-day refund policy is longer than average\n- Dedicated servers for streaming and torrenting\n- Decent performance when using WireGuard\nCons\n- OpenVPN speeds can be underwhelming\n- Only 7 simultaneous connections\n- It doesn\u2019t offer VPN connection masking (obfuscation)\nCyberGhost has the best free trial VPN offers you\u2019ll find on this list. It\u2019s not necessarily the most impressive provider but its incentives are far too attractive to reject. Here\u2019s the deal. You can get a 24-hour VPN free trial without a credit card on your Windows or Mac computer.\nSimply download the app, sign up for free, and use it for a day. Other than that, there\u2019s a 3-day Android trial plus a 7-day iOS trial. What\u2019s more, CyberGhost also has the longest money-back guarantee of 45 days, which gives you ample time to test it thoroughly.\nThis provider does many things right, including dedicated torrenting and streaming servers, amazing performance with WireGuard, and unlimited bandwidth. Our experience with this service has always been great, especially when we wanted added security and privacy.\nCyberGhost\u2019s NoSpy servers are great for this because they\u2019re owned by this company. Let\u2019s also mention its IPv6 leak protection and RAM-exclusive servers, both of which are the building blocks of your privacy. We can add its no-log policy to that as well.\nCyberGhost holds nothing back when it comes to other non-VPN-related options. Like PIA, it has this antivirus offer for $1 a month but with the addition of Security Updater, which updates all your computer\u2019s apps and keeps vulnerabilities at bay. A neat little addition.\nWe found this provider slightly underwhelming because it lacks obfuscation and protects only 7 devices simultaneously, hence its place. However, as a free VPN trial offer, it\u2019s hard to beat CyberGhost in the number of amazing incentives available for all platforms.\nMoney-Back Guarantee vs VPN Free Trial: Which to Use?\nIn this guide, we cycled back and forth between these terms; free trial & money-back guarantee. The first one is exactly what it sounds like. It\u2019s a trial period that allows you to test the service WITHOUT paying. However, a VPN free trial doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you don\u2019t need to provide a credit card. It only means you won\u2019t be charged right away.\nThen, we have the money-back guarantee. It\u2019s important to differentiate this and a refund policy. The latter comes with specific conditions that must be fulfilled to be reimbursed. A money-back guarantee is by definition something non-conditional. If you end up disliking the service you\u2019ve got, you\u2019re GUARANTEED to get your money back!\nIt\u2019s good to know that all 6 VPN with free trials also have real money-back guarantees, so they\u2019ll refund you in 30 or 45 days depending on the selected service. For a money-back guarantee, you have to pay first and subscribe to the service before you can be refunded \u2013 logical.\nHowever, it has the advantage of being longer. While free trial VPN offers don\u2019t go over 7 days, a money-back guarantee is from 30 to 45 days. We can\u2019t tell you which is better because it will depend on your preferences. Our opinion is that a money-back guarantee is better because you can use the VPN for longer but have to pay initially.\nIn the end, both have equal outcomes \u2013 you\u2019re not losing money.\nHow to Get a VPN Free Trial Without a Credit Card?\nThere are a few VPN providers that offer a free trial without requiring payment info, but we found most to be subpar. Our list consists exclusively of top-rated services that you can trust, although almost none of them allow for a trial without at least some payment info.\nCyberGhost is an exception and it lets you test the VPN on Mac and Windows for 24 hours just by registering and downloading the app. We can, in a way, put Proton VPN here. It doesn\u2019t have a free trial but rather a free plan that requires nothing more than an email.\nWe think that providing payment information for a trial shouldn\u2019t pose a problem if you\u2019re canceling it. Many people forget to do that and get charged but again, that can be solved if you request a refund in 30 days. If you\u2019re all about privacy and don\u2019t want to provide this information, we get it.\nThe only remaining solution is to use cryptocurrencies. Bear in mind this leaves you with a money-back guarantee option because all free trial VPNs require either your credit card or PayPal during the registration process on your iOS or Android phone.\nIs a VPN Free Trial Better Than a Free VPN?\nYes, we honestly think it is. Free providers have one glaring advantage and that\u2019s the option to use them forever without paying. Proton VPN is one such provider whose free plan is unlimited and requires no money. However, it also has many disadvantages.\nSuch a provider blocks P2P traffic, it\u2019s poor for streaming and is pretty slow. Bear in mind that Proton VPN is likely the best overall non-paid option.\nIf we take other free providers, such as:\n- TunnelBear\n- Betternet\n- Hola VPN\n- Hotspot Shield\n- Hide.me\n- Windscribe\n- PrivadoVPN, and more\u2026\nYou\u2019ll notice a few persistent problems. First, most are bandwidth-limited, so you\u2019re getting from 2 GB to 10 GB monthly. Second, neither can unblock Netflix. Third, at least half of them store logs \u2013 we\u2019re looking primarily at you Hola! These providers have all kinds of issues.\nWe don\u2019t say you won\u2019t like some of them but you surely won\u2019t be as satisfied as you would if you were using some of the best free trials on VPNs. After all, these are premium providers with no limits, zero logging, full streaming/P2P support, and other notable advantages.\nThe only downside is that your free trial period is limited to a maximum of 45 days. But the experience you\u2019ll get is vastly different with paid providers; in a good way, of course. If you still prefer free providers, you can pick some of the best from our list but don\u2019t expect much.\nAre There Any 30-day Free Trial VPNs?\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s hard to find a provider with a free trial that lasts for 30 days. All providers with excellent reputations on our list are capped at 7 days and very few providers offer more than that. You can always use a money-back guarantee if you want 30 days of risk-free use.\nBut as explained, a money-back guarantee works differently and you\u2019ll have to pay before you can get a refund in a month or so. You can try to combine the offers from our list. For example, use NordVPN for free for 7 days. After that\u2019s over, move to ExpressVPN and so on.\nEnjoy NordVPN\u2019s 30-day Free Trial\nIf you combine all of the best-rated VPN free trials, you can get up to 42 days of risk-free use. That\u2019s the only way to get 30 or more days of use without spending a dollar.\nHow to Cancel My VPN Free Trial?\nThere are a few ways to do it but by far the simplest is to go to your account and disable automatic renewal. This will ensure that when the trial ends, the VPN subscription terminates and you\u2019re not charged. Another method is to contact the service directly.\nAll of them have live chat support, so it\u2019s easy to visit the site and ask the support team to end your VPN free trial and not charge you again. If you\u2019ve paid after the trial and want a refund, the process is the same. Contact the support and request your money back.\nOne thing to note is that if you\u2019ve bought the VPN through a third-party site (Google Play, Amazon, Apple App Store, \u2026), you\u2019ll likely have to get a refund through that platform.\nSummary\nTo digress, the best free trial VPNs of 2025 are NordVPN, ExpressVPN, PIA, Proton VPN, Surfshark, and CyberGhost. We suggest using NordVPN for the best overall experience, with ExpressVPN being a close second in terms of overall reliability and performance.\nPIA is very affordable, so it even makes sense to buy it after the trial period if you can spend over $2 a month. We then have Proton VPN whose forever-free plan is attractive and serves as an introduction to the service before and if you decide to buy it. What about Surfshark?\nAnother splendid option with unlimited connections and top-notch streaming prowess! Finally, we have CyberGhost with the most impressive VPN free trials and a 45-day money-back guarantee. We hope this list was helpful enough and that your decision is set in stone at this point.\nDon\u2019t wait \u2013 get a VPN and enhance your internet experience, if only for 7 or 30 days."

      "text": "It\u2019s one of the easiest things on the internet to get your hands on. Well, at least it used to be. Truth is, pornographic content is becoming increasingly restricted, even in countries like the United States. Good thing that with a quality VPN for porn, you can bypass the hindrances to all the adult sites and NSFW content you\u2019re interested in.\nIt also comes in handy because, if you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019d much rather remain anonymous while watching porn. Incognito Mode doesn\u2019t quite cut it, and you\u2019re exposing yourself to tracking without a VPN.\nVPNs encrypt your traffic and conceal your IP address, allowing you to bypass various forms of content blocking and restrictions. However, you can\u2019t just depend on any provider. This article unveils the best VPNs for accessing porn and keeping you under the radar.\nThe Best VPN for Porn \u2014 The Top 5 Options\nWe selected the providers below because they offer the best speed, unblocking, network, privacy, and security combinations. They are also user-friendly VPNs. We\u2019ll explore the factors we considered later in the article.\nWell, then, let\u2019s take a closer look at each VPN.\n7492 servers\n118 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n10 simultaneous connections\n9.4 /10\n3000 servers\n105 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n8 simultaneous connections\n9.1 /10\n27000 servers\n91 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\nUnlimited connections\n9 /10\n6500 servers\n112 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n10 simultaneous connections\n8.8 /10\n3000 servers\n100 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\nUnlimited connections\n8.7 /10\n1. NordVPN\nNordVPN is undoubtedly the best VPN for porn on the market. It easily circumvents blocks in countries that frown on pornographic content and is the best choice for bypassing the age verification liability laws sweeping across the United States in states like Texas.\nDoes it help that NordVPN has a network with over 7,000 servers spread across 118 countries? Sure, it does. Of that pool, almost 2,000 servers are in the United States. That massive spread means you can easily connect to a nearby option to beat porn restrictions in your state or country.\nNordVPN claims to update its servers regularly to ensure you get the fastest speeds. Considering the consistently stable connections we encounter every time we give it a spin, it\u2019s easy to believe that boast. You can expect to stream your porn videos without deflating buffering and interruptions ruining the experience.\nThe provider\u2019s NordLynx protocol is built around WireGuard and delivers even better speeds than OpenVPN without compromising security.\nNordVPN operates out of data privacy-friendly Panama. On top of that, it has a strict no-logs policy that has gone under scrutiny multiple times.\nIt\u2019s also loaded with features. On the security side, the VPN encrypts your data with the virtually uncrackable AES 256-bit algorithm and includes a kill switch and DNS leak protection. Apart from its Threat Protection Pro being great for getting rid of intrusive ads, we like that it protects you from malicious porn sites.\nYou can also find features like split tunneling useful when you want to unblock Pornhub while keeping your other devices on a regular network.\nWatch porn on any device with the VPN activated because it\u2019s widely compatible. Plus, one subscription covers up to ten devices simultaneously.\nFor all its top-notch functionality, you don\u2019t have to empty your pockets to enjoy NordVPN\u2019s top-notch features. A 30-day money-back guarantee adds to the provider\u2019s excellent value for money.\n2. ExpressVPN\nExpressVPN is another excellent option for accessing adult sites securely, whether they\u2019re blocked in your location or not. It does so effortlessly. For instance, we spoofed our location by connecting to its servers outside the state, and the provider instantly beat the Pornhub block in Nebraska.\nOther attempts were just as successful, much of which is down to its widespread network. With over 3,000 servers in 105 countries across six continents, you\u2019re bound to find nearby connection options wherever you are.\nThe provider uses 10 Gbps servers that deliver fast connection speeds. We got a UK IP address, headed to Xhamster, and set a video\u2019s resolution to 1080p, the highest quality. Impressively, in spite of our distance from the server, the VPN managed to maintain seamless playback with no buffering. Like NordVPN, Express also has a custom protocol built with performance in mind.\nYou never have to worry about your streaming tastes getting exposed. For one, ExpressVPN\u2019s headquarters is in the British Virgin Islands, away from meddlesome jurisdictions. What\u2019s more, it uses RAM-only servers that wipe clean when reset. On top of that, the provider has a no-logs policy that\u2019s been tested multiple times.\nExpressVPN\u2019s Threat Manager blocks the pesky ads and trackers that are rampant on porn sites. We also like that you can set the VPN to automatically activate when you connect to an unsecured Wi-Fi network. That way, a spontaneous Pornhub binge in your hotel room doesn\u2019t have embarrassing (or much worse) consequences.\nYou don\u2019t need to be tech-savvy to use ExpressVPN\u2019s widely available apps. When you purchase a plan, it covers up to eight simultaneous connections at the same time, which is enough for most people.\nExpressVPN\u2019s pricing isn\u2019t exactly dirt cheap. That said, a 30-day money-back guarantee gives you ample time to see if it\u2019s worth it.\n3. Private Internet Access\nAlmost 20 US states now have a form of verification requirement for porn sites, and they are potential privacy nightmares. Don\u2019t worry, though; with Private Internet Access, you can skip those states and still get an American IP address because it has servers in every American state. That way, you\u2019ll maintain your smut access without the slower connection of a distant server. For example, this makes PIA VPN a top choice when it comes to watching content on Pornhub while in Florida.\nThe provider doesn\u2019t just have a vast collection in the US. In fact, its network leaves competitors in the dust, with more than 30,000 servers distributed across 91 countries.\nYou won\u2019t have to struggle through choppy porn streaming sessions. PIA\u2019s servers all have 10 Gbps ports, for one. Coupled with the wealth of connection options and the speed-friendly WireGuard, you can expect the smooth, uninterrupted streaming we experienced during testing.\nWe don\u2019t say this often, but there\u2019s no need to be concerned about PIA\u2019s United States jurisdiction. The provider has a policy of never keeping connection or activity logs. And that\u2019s not just an empty claim \u2014 it\u2019s been tested multiple times in court and by third-party auditors.\nSecurity-wise, it implements AES 128-bit encryption out of the box to scramble your traffic and prevent snoops from getting to your data. While that algorithm has a slight performance advantage, Private Internet Access also allows you to switch to the more secure AES 256-bit.\nMany small-scale porn sites host malicious ads loaded with malware, but PIA\u2019s MACE is pretty effective at blocking them so you can have safer streaming sessions. And a split tunneling feature lets you watch porn via the VPN connection while leaving your other apps without the VPN\u2019s mask.\nBecause PIA is so customizable, it\u2019s an excellent choice for those who like to tinker. It supports unlimited simultaneous connections, which means a single subscription covers all your household devices. That subscription also comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n4. Proton VPN\nUp next is the VPN from the company behind acclaimed security-focused products like Proton Mail. It\u2019s the only provider on this list with an absolutely free version, but while that\u2019s arguably the best free VPN plan around, we recommend sticking to its paid version for your steamy videos.\nWhy? Because the VPN says it \u201conly guarantees\u201d streaming if you have a Plus or Unlimited plan. We tested the free option anyway and encountered some buffering while streaming in high-quality video resolutions while connected to distant servers. Switching to Plus instantly unblocked Pornhub in North Carolina and bypassed the XHamster age verification process.\nProton VPN\u2019s proprietary Stealth protocol is especially great at beating content blocks. Those on adult sites are a piece of cake.\nBest of all, you can enjoy all the adult-themed content you want without running into annoying buffering, thanks to the VPN\u2019s 10 Gbps servers. Its VPN Accelerator feature promises to boost speeds by up to 400% \u2014 and it\u2019s not just a gimmick. Even over less reliable internet conditions, we could stream relatively smoothly.\nProton VPN\u2019s reputation for privacy and security is well-grounded. You can be confident that your browsing history never sees the light of day because the VPN enforces a strict no-logs policy that independent security experts have verified. It doesn\u2019t hurt that it\u2019s based in Switzerland, where laws protect VPN use and users.\nOn top of that, Proton VPN uses only the strongest encryption to protect your network traffic, so not even your ISP can see what you\u2019re doing. NetShield, its ad-blocker, blocks ads and prevents trackers from following you on the adult sites you visit.\nProton VPN is compatible with all the major operating systems and, like NordVPN, allows up to ten simultaneous connections. All plans come with a 30-day money-back guarantee. We especially like that subscriptions renew at the same price (unlike most competitors).\n5. Surfshark\nSurfshark\u2019s Alternative ID is a novel feature that can come in handy for accessing exclusive porn sites that require signing up. It lets you generate a brand-new identity (an online name and email) to mask yours on websites you don\u2019t trust, minimizing the chances of your personal information falling into the wrong hands. For an extra fee, you can even generate a phone number.\nAs for unblocking, it\u2019s easy to see how Surfshark is one of the best VPNs for Pornhub. We were impressed by its capabilities when it unblocked the adult site in states like Virginia while providing unrestricted access to other porn websites.\nIt\u2019s also quite fast, thanks to high-bandwidth servers and performance-friendly protocols like WireGuard. Surfshark has over 3,200 servers in all. Granted, that\u2019s not the deepest collection, but it does count that they are spread across 100 countries, so chances are that you have options nearby.\nFor its affordable pricing (when you consider long-term plans), Surfshark doesn\u2019t compromise privacy. While it\u2019s based in the Netherlands, a 9 Eyes member country, the VPN sticks to a strict no-logs policy, as confirmed by multiple third-party audits.\nBecause it uses bank-level AES 256-bit encryption, neither your ISP nor malicious actors can access your data. Its Nexus technology hides your digital footprint even more than a regular VPN. It comes with an IP Rotator feature that periodically changes your IP address, making it all the harder to trace you.\nNo need to pick and choose what devices to enjoy your erotic entertainment on because Surfshark allows unlimited simultaneous connections. Plus, it supports a wide range of them.\nIf you\u2019re interested in giving this VPN a go, we recommend checking out its budget-friendly, longer-term plans. Because there\u2019s a 30-day money-back guarantee attached, you have enough time to decide on committing.\nWhy You Need a VPN for Porn\nFor something that\u2019s all over the internet, you\u2019d be surprised at how many people can\u2019t actually access porn. Many countries limit access to pornographic content, whether by placing restrictions or outright bans. And when we say \u201cmany,\u201d we mean dozens of them.\nIf you\u2019re visiting one of those countries, you\u2019d have to wait to get back home before getting your fix of spicy content. Or you could circumvent those restrictions with a VPN.\nThere\u2019s no complete ban on porn in the United States, but considering the hoops you have to jump through in some states, there may as well be. These states have placed restrictions in the form of verification liability laws. They first popped up in Louisiana and have now swept across the country.\nCurrently, these US states require age verification before accessing porn content:\n- Louisiana\n- Utah\n- Mississippi\n- Virginia\n- Nebraska\n- Arkansas\n- Texas\n- Montana\n- North Carolina\n- Indiana\n- South Carolina\n- Idaho\n- Kansas\n- Kentucky\n- Florida\n- Oklahoma\n- Alabama\n- Tennessee\n- Georgia\nOn the one hand, the directives aim at protecting minors from viewing \u201charmful content.\u201d That said, they require grown-up porn fans to provide sensitive data, potentially putting their privacy at risk. Besides, the laws have led to Pornhub blocking access to its content in the affected states.\nThat aside, some adult sites are hotbeds for internet nasties. They may be riddled with pop-ups or malware that can do more than just annoy you.\nThankfully, a VPN presents an effective workaround for these issues. When you connect to a VPN server in a different location (without a porn restriction), the provider encrypts your network and reroutes it through a secure tunnel to that server. There, it masks and temporarily replaces your IP address, essentially spoofing your location.\nSimply put, a good VPN tricks websites with restrictions into thinking you\u2019re in the same location as that server, and you have free access to all your NSFW content. What\u2019s more, the extra layer of security provided keeps any lurking cyber threats at bay.\nHow We Chose the Best VPNs for Porn\nWith so many VPNs out there promising the world, it\u2019s easy to get lost in the sea of options. Some claim to be the fastest, while others boast about ironclad privacy. But not all of them deliver on these promises.\nYou don\u2019t want to waste money on a VPN that can\u2019t even keep your secrets safe, right? That\u2019s why we rolled up our sleeves and tested over 40 VPNs to separate the real gems from the duds. Here\u2019s what we looked for when putting together this list:\n- Bypassing Restrictions: If you\u2019ve ever faced the frustration of seeing pornstar Cherie DeVille and her video message when visiting Pornhub, you know how annoying restrictions can be. We looked for VPNs that jump over porn blocks and ID verification systems effortlessly. They can also sneak you past internet restrictions in countries that censor adult content.\n- Server Availability and Speed: Nobody likes that pesky buffering icon when you\u2019re in the middle of something. That\u2019s why we focused on VPNs with a ton of servers all over the globe. More servers usually mean less congestion and faster speeds, letting you stream your favorite high-quality videos smoothly, no matter where you are.\n- Privacy and Security: You don\u2019t want prying eyes on your secret browsing habits. The best porn VPNs have top-notch security features like tough encryption (think military-grade), a strict no-logs policy, and safety nets like kill switches and DNS leak protection.\n- Extra Features: Top providers typically have useful extras that can come in handy for accessing or watching porn, so we had that in mind. They include ad and malware blockers, split tunneling, as well as nifty tools like Surfshark\u2019s Alternative ID.\n- Ease of Use: The last thing you need is to wrestle with a complicated interface when all you want is a secure connection. We get that. So, we picked VPNs with straightforward, user-friendly apps that make connecting to a server a breeze, whether you\u2019re on your phone, tablet, or computer.\n- Compatibility: We only chose VPNs that support various platforms and operating systems like Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. That way, you\u2019re covered no matter what device you use.\n- Money-Back Guarantee: Your money doesn\u2019t have to go down the drain if you\u2019re not impressed. Each VPN for porn we selected gives you a refund window to claim your subscription fee if you find the provider doesn\u2019t work for you.\nCan You Use a Free VPN for Porn?\nBad idea. While there are a handful of free VPNs we like, we don\u2019t recommend using a free VPN for adult content.\nFor one, the vast majority of free VPNs only have limited server options. Usually, that translates into slow connection speeds and lagging, both of which can ruin your streaming experience. Besides, their small collection means fewer connection options in other locations where the content you\u2019re interested in is accessible.\nMore importantly, VPN services have to make money somehow. If you\u2019re not paying a subscription, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re paying in other ways. Some free providers make a habit of logging your data and selling it to third parties. That\u2019s a pretty scary thought when privacy is your main concern.\nAnother thing to consider is security. Many free VPNs don\u2019t have the robust security features you\u2019ll find in premium services. This lack of protection can leave you vulnerable to cyber threats and data leaks. And that\u2019s the opposite of what you want when you\u2019re trying to maintain anonymity.\nIn short, while free VPNs might seem appealing at first glance, they come with too many risks and limitations. You\u2019re much better off using the trusted and tested services discussed above.\nFinal Thoughts\nA quality provider allows you to enjoy your smut sessions without worrying about censorship blocks, verification processes, and privacy concerns. It encrypts your traffic, securing your personal data and obscuring your location.\nWe\u2019ve highlighted and discussed the best porn VPNs in this article. Our favorite VPN for porn is NordVPN, thanks to its high-level privacy and security arsenal, lightning-fast connection speeds, and reliability. Each NordVPN plan comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can see what it\u2019s about completely risk-free.\nFAQs\nAny extra questions about using a VPN for porn? You may find the answers you need below.\nWhy can\u2019t I view adult content?\nMany countries have strict laws that block access to adult websites, so if you\u2019re in one of those places, you might find that a lot of content is simply off-limits.\nAnother possibility is that your internet service provider (ISP) is putting up roadblocks. Some ISPs actively block or throttle access to certain websites, including adult content, as part of their service policies.\nAlternatively, if you\u2019re using your school or office Wi-Fi, it may restrict your connection.\nLastly, parental controls or content filers on your web browser may be in the way. Whatever your case is, a VPN\u2019s help will come in handy and destroy all the obstacles standing between you and your daily dose of pornography.\nHow do I unblock an adult site?\nUsing a VPN is the most reliable way to unblock an adult site. Quality services like NordVPN encrypt your online traffic and reroute it to a remote server, allowing you to bypass various restrictions on content, including blocks on porn content.\nSome people mention Tor and various web proxies as alternative solutions. In our experience, they\u2019re incomparable to VPNs whose IP-changing prowess, security, and privacy are superior. VPNs are built for unblocking sites; Tor and proxies aren\u2019t.\nCan I watch porn in incognito or private mode?\nYes, but while incognito mode can hide your browsing history from other people using the same device, it doesn\u2019t offer complete privacy. The sites you visit and your ISP can still track your activity, and your IP address remains visible.\nIf you\u2019re looking to enjoy porn videos privately, a VPN is a much better option.\nWhat is the best VPN to watch porn privately?\nNordVPN is the best VPN provider for porn. It delivers top-notch protection for your data, unblocks sites like Pornhub, and offers fast connection speeds ideal for overcoming porn bans in Florida or any other state/country."

      "text": "Even birds know that everything you do online is monitored by your ISP. Sometimes, you want a bit of privacy, which also includes watching porn anonymously. Most people think that their \u201cIncognito\u201d mode will keep snoopers away. Sadly, this plan always goes awry.\nThe Incognito mode doesn\u2019t prevent your ISP from snooping. It also doesn\u2019t prevent the porn site you\u2019re on to collect your IP address and track your activities. Instead, it only prevents your porn binge-watching from making it to your browsing history.\nOur cybersecurity experts you should settle for much more and let no intruders follow in your online footsteps. Follow us, as we demonstrate how to watch porn anonymously and give you many insightful tips.\nPro Tip: Use a VPN to Watch Porn Privately\nLet\u2019s give you the most valuable tip right away. It comes in the form of a VPN or Virtual Private Network. This tool provides a few benefits, such as:\n- Changing your IP address for a new one,\n- Encrypting your traffic so that it becomes unreadable,\n- Covering your online footsteps by not keeping any logs.\nThere are more VPN benefits but these three are especially important for watching porn anonymously. Once you connect to this service, your original IP is swapped for another one, which can be in another country. This means you\u2019ll pose as a different person.\nDuring this process, VPNs apply encryption (256-bit a.k.a military-grade), preventing your connection from being readable. This means the ISP will see a garbled mess of letters and symbols each time it tries to track you. Conversely, porn sites will collect browsing data associated with the VPN\u2019s IP and not yours.\nFinally, top VPNs on the market have RAM-only servers and don\u2019t store any logs. Whatever you do online is YOUR privacy and they will keep no tabs on you. This is by far the #1 tip to see porn anonymously and ensure only you know what you\u2019re up to.\nHow to Watch Porn Anonymously With a VPN?\nDon\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not acquainted with this service. We\u2019ll recommend NordVPN as the simplest, yet most effective one. It comes with all the benefits from above, with added unlimited bandwidth, fast speed, and cheap prices that start at a speck over $3/mo.\nAccess Porn Privately With NordVPN\nThe button above will lead you straight to NordVPN\u2019s site where you can subscribe to it. Don\u2019t fret \u2013 it has a 30-day money-back guarantee if you make up your mind. Once subscribed, make sure you download NordVPN to your device. It has free VPN clients that you can download and use on 10 different devices at a time.\nNow, open the application and sign in with your email and password. From here, just connect to any server and you\u2019re set. You can now go to Pornhub, XNXX, YouPorn, Xhamster, or any other site and use it without anyone\u2019s notice. Age verification can also be bypassed!\nIf you\u2019re in Texas where Pornhub won\u2019t work, using NordVPN can alleviate the issue. Also, we picked this VPN because of its added security/privacy features we\u2019ll address in other tips for watching pornography anonymously.\nOther Tips for Watching Pornhub Anonymously\nThe VPN is the base of using the internet privately. However, using this service doesn\u2019t guarantee 100% anonymity. The way you use the internet dictates how \u201cprivate\u201d you\u2019ll be online, so don\u2019t look at VPNs as end-all-be-all solutions. Here are a few helpful tips.\nUse Your Browser\u2019s Incognito Mode\nWe said the incognito mode isn\u2019t great for privacy and that still stands. However, if you use a shared device, like a family computer, it\u2019s handy to use your Incognito mode for this purpose. Remember that the Incognito mode doesn\u2019t store your web history.\nThis means whatever you do or watch inside won\u2019t be visible to other users. Before using the Incognito mode, enable a VPN for added privacy and you\u2019ll be safe from your ISP and other snoopers AND people around you (family members, colleagues, \u2026).\nEnable Malware Protection\nMalware protection is handy when visiting porn sites. We advocate using VPNs when watching pornography to ensure privacy and anonymity, but a VPN alone won\u2019t usually protect you against malware. Yet, malware is typical for adult sites that frequently distribute it via ads and pop-ups.\nWhile more popular sites rely on this tactic less, those on the opposite spectrum still do. They\u2019ll \u201cinject\u201d malware if you click on the pop-up without you even realizing it. The good news is that NordVPN has Threat Protection that prevents ads and trackers.\nYou don\u2019t need to buy Malwarebytes or any other program. Your NordVPN client contains Threat Protection, which, when enabled, sways off malicious sites, malware, ads, and trackers. Its real-time detection is also useful, as it prevents threats from entering your device.\nOf course, you can go for dedicated software if you want. Companies like Avast, Avira, Norton, and Kaspersky offer their virus protection and anti-malware. Be aware that these companies also tend to store logs and aren\u2019t very privacy-oriented.\nGain Additional Protection With NordVPN\nAvoid Making Accounts on Porn Sites\nNo, don\u2019t do this even if you\u2019re a huge fan of a specific website. ALL adult sites collect user data, so forget about watching porn anonymously this way. Look at the privacy policies of YouPorn, Pornhub, RedTube, and others, and you\u2019ll find just how much they know.\nThey store data like billing information, gender, birthday, sexual preferences, and so on. Luckily, you don\u2019t need an account to enjoy this content. You can watch porn anonymously without giving a speck of your data to these websites, so don\u2019t push your luck.\nUse VPN Browser Extensions\nEvery site, and by extension a porn site, stores cookies, and trackers on your device. Even Gizmodo relies on cookies. However, you don\u2019t want an adult site to store cookies and trackers on your device if you don\u2019t want to see adult ads on your devices. Gross!\nThat\u2019s why you can think about using a VPN browser extension. The one from NordVPN is particularly good, as it prevents tracking and eliminates ads and pop-ups. ExpressVPN also has a great VPN for Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and other supported browsers.\nTry NordVPN\u2019s Browser VPN Risk-Free\nSuch add-ons are effective at enabling anonymous porn watching. They can also unblock various foreign TV channels, streaming services, and online bookies.\nCan I See Pornography Anonymously With a Free VPN?\nYou can, as long as you take the necessary precautions. While we\u2019re not fond of free providers, some of them are pretty safe. Proton VPN and Hide.me often come to mind with their unlimited bandwidth, somewhat stellar performance, and apps for all devices.\nThese VPNs can be used to watch porn sites privately with a few caveats. They don\u2019t support simultaneous connections and lack some premium security features. For instance, neither of them has ad/tracker/malware protection, which is necessary when using adult sites.\nRemember that these sites can and will track you, which you can\u2019t totally prevent without a capable ad-blocker. Some free providers limit your bandwidth too, so options like Windscribe, PrivadoVPN, and TunnelBear might not be for everyone despite their safety.\nIn short, you can watch porn privately with a free VPN but only if you pick the right one. Picking the wrong one will produce the opposite effect. Remember that NordVPN is free for 30 days, so you already have a much better option, even though it\u2019s temporary.\nThe Final Verdict\nYou don\u2019t have to be a cybersecurity PhD to watch porn anonymously. Our experts recommend using a VPN as the backbone of your privacy.\nWe advise NordVPN, however, if you want more choices, consider ExpressVPN and Private Internet Access as alternatives.\nThese two offer the same great features, including an ad blocker and tracker protection, amplifying your anonymity while binge-watching pornography.\nWhen the VPN is in place, follow the other steps we mentioned to enhance your privacy and avoid online threats. Know that with these VPNs, you won\u2019t have any trouble bypassing the Pornhub blockage in Florida as well as in other states and countries."
