  "title": "Savings rates drop as Bank of England cuts interest rates",
  "description": "Check the best savings accounts to find a top-rated deal that works for you",
  "content": "UK households are always looking for ways to make their money go further amid the cost of living crisis, and savings accounts can help. Savings accounts this week took a hit as the Bank of England (BoE) cut interest rates to 4%, with most lenders dropping their best deals in tandem with Threadneedle Street's reduction. However, consumers can still find UK savings accounts offering rates above inflation. Experts urge savers to shop around for the best deals and review their accounts regularly, as many may still be sitting on products that fail to beat inflation. The primary inflation measure, the consumer price index (CPI), stood at 3.6% in the 12 months to June, well above the BoE's 2% target. Emma Sterland, chief financial planning officer at wealth management firm Evelyn Partners, said: \"This probably signals the end of the road for many savings accounts that currently beat inflation, running at 3.6% in June. We can expect to see savings rates reduced in the coming days and weeks, leaving returns on even the best accounts only marginally positive in real terms \u2013 especially after tax. \"That can leave families who want to hold cash in a real quandary.\" Matthew Allen, lecturer in eeconomics at the University of Salford, added: \"While the interest rate cut is a positive development, it\u2019s far from a clean bill of health for the economy. Inflation remains stubborn in key sectors such as services and food, and households are still grappling with the aftershock of prolonged price rises. \"For savers, falling rates also mean lower returns on deposits, potentially eroding household wealth over time.\" The main factor to consider when choosing a savings account is the difference between easy-access and fixed-term accounts. Read more: Bank of England cuts interest rate to two-year low Easy-access accounts allow you to access your money when you need it. Fixed-term means you can\u2019t access your cash for the duration of the deal. They usually offer better rates, but you must be comfortable not touching your savings for an extended period, usually between one and five years. What are the best high-interest, fixed-rate accounts? Just last week savers could get a market-leading 5% for three months but now the best on the table is 4.45% from LHV. You need at least \u00a31,000 to open the account and can invest up to one million. Vanquis has an one-year deal paying 4.44% where you can invest from \u00a31000 to \u00a3250,000, with interest paid monthly or at maturity. Atom Bank pays 4.42% for an one-year that only requires \u00a350 to open.\n\nOnline banks typically offer higher rates than traditional bricks-and-mortar branches, which translate into better returns, giving you a more efficient way to save and reach financial goals. If you prefer to go with a familiar name, the high-street lenders have slightly lower offers, but are still above inflation. Tesco (TSCO.L) Bank offers the highest rate among high-street lenders, with a one-year fixed-rate savings account that pays 3.8%, with the minimum balance required being \u00a32,000. However, you can invest up to \u00a35m. NatWest (NWG.L) has a fixed-term savings account offering 3.8% for one year. The minimum deposit is just \u00a31 and interest will be paid first business day of every month and on the maturity date. Unlike easy-access products, where interest rates can vary, fixed-rate accounts earn a set rate of interest for the period you choose, whether that's six months or several years. Those are the most common deals, but some offers go up to 10 years and over. Read more: Best credit cards for holidays and travelling You must leave your initial deposit for a fixed period without making withdrawals. If you touch your money, you forfeit any interest. What are the best easy-access savings accounts? Easy-access savings accounts let you withdraw your money without notice. With that ease of access come lower interest rates, but they are a good option for those who think they might need their money in a hurry. Be aware that rates on these accounts are variable, which means they can go up or down. You will be notified of any change ahead of time. Chase offers a 5% deal that you can access with only \u00a31. New customers can open its linked easy-access saver within 31 days of opening the account, which gives 5% (2.75% variable plus 2.25% fixed month bonus). Cahoot pays 4.55% but with only \u00a31 minimum to access. You can invest up to \u00a32,000,000 but they will only pay interest on balances up to \u00a3500,000. The WestBrom BS also pays 4.55% with only \u00a31 minimum to access. The interest rate will go down to 1.90% gross p.a./AER if you take money out more than four times per year. There are even higher-paying easy-access accounts, but they are not for new customers. Santander's (BNC.L) Edge Saver, for instance, offers 6%, but is only available to current account holders. What are the best notice savings accounts? Can\u2019t decide on whether you want to put your money away and not touch it for a long time or keep it accessible at all times? Maybe you should consider a notice savings account. Notice savings accounts require you to give notice to your savings provider before you can withdraw your funds. These are ideal for those who know when they might need their cash but don\u2019t want to face the temptation of dipping into it at any time. Read more: How you can still make money from flipping property You need to give the bank or building society a set advance warning before you can withdraw your money \u2014 usually between 30 and 120 days, though this can be longer. RCI Bank has a 95-day product that pays 4.7%. You\u2019ll need at least \u00a31,000 to open it and can deposit up to \u00a31m. The Stafford BS pays 4.65% on a 120-day deal, and you can invest anything from \u00a31,000 to \u00a3500,000. Interest is paid monthly into the account. GB Bank has a 120-day product that pays 4.58% for which you'll need \u00a31,000 to access. Interest rates with notice accounts are variable, which means they could go up or down over time. What are the best regular savings accounts? For those looking to make the most of their cash savings, regular savings accounts offer almost 8% returns. Most regular savings accounts require you to put money away each month with interest paid yearly. It is not uncommon for the offer to be available only to current customers. Principality offers 7.5% in a six-month regular saver account, after dropping its 8% deal. You open an account and pay in up to \u00a3200 each month. Interest is calculated on the money in the account each day and paid six months after opening.

Account holders also receive 2% AER interest on all balances and 2% cashback on bill payments. The Co-operative Bank has a 7% deal for existing customers. Fixed for one year, you can save up to \u00a3250 per month and can skip months without penalties. Every deal mentioned here is covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, so you are protected up to \u00a385,000 or double that if it\u2019s a joint account.

      "text": "In the Nineties and Noughties, a significant number of property investors \u2014 and ordinary owner-occupiers \u2014 were making large amounts of money from buying properties in need of refurbishment, doing them up quickly and selling them on at a profit, aka flipping. But, 20 years on, this practice is much less common.\nAccording to recent figures from Hamptons Research, in the first quarter of 2025, the proportion of homes bought and then re-sold within a year (ie flipped) fell to 2.3% across England and Wales, down from 3.6% in Q1 2024. This equated to 7,301 flipped homes in Q1 2025, 27% below the 10-year Q1 average.\nThe average profit of these Q1 2025 flips was \u00a322,000 and Hamptons found that while 80% of flipped homes were sold for a higher price in Q1 2025, only 66% made a profit.\nSo, how can you still make money from flipping? We spoke to several experts to find out.\nWhy has flipping property become less profitable?\nWhile there are several factors eating into flippers\u2019 profits, the main one is stamp duty. Not only have rates increased over the last 20 years, but property price inflation means that more properties are liable for this tax, while investors with multiple properties have to pay stamp duty at an additional rate.\n\u201cBigger stamp duty bills are wiping out a lot of profit from flipping. The 5% surcharge for investors, coupled with a reduction in the point at which buyers start paying stamp duty, means it\u2019s harder than ever to make the sums stack up,\u201d says Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons.\nThe average stamp duty bill which was once around 10% of a flipper\u2019s gross profit, now swallows up around 30%.\n\u201cAs recently as 20 years ago the highest rate of stamp duty was 2%. Now it is 12%, plus an extra 2% if you are an overseas buyer and an additional 3% if you own a property anywhere else in the world. So, you could be paying as much as 15% of the value in tax,\u201d flags Marc Schneiderman, director, Arlington Residential.\nRenovating a property has also become more expensive, meaning investors need to pay out increasing amounts initially.\n\u201cRenovation costs have also risen, while inflation in both labour and materials, along with new compliance requirements such as energy efficiency standards, has increased upfront investment and overall project risk,\u201d says Caroline Marshall-Roberts, CEO and founder of BuyAssociation.\nSarah Walker, owner of Walker Hall Estate Agent, gives the example of a kitchen refurb. \u201cA kitchen that might have been \u00a38,000 just a few years ago can easily come in at \u00a315,000 or more once you factor in appliances, fitting and VAT.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more, the reduction of the capital gains allowance and stricter rules on what can be claimed on this make tax-efficient renovations difficult. \u201cCombine this with uncertain market timing and tighter lending conditions, and today\u2019s property investors looking to flip properties are dealing with thinner margins and greater exposure to downturns,\u201d adds Marshall-Roberts.\nWhich areas of the UK are still profitable when it comes to flipping?\nThere are still areas of the country where you can flip and make a profit. According to Hamptons Research, the North East is the only region where flipping has become more common over the last decade. This is predominantly due to the prevalence of homes costing less than \u00a340,000, well below the stamp duty threshold of \u00a3125,000.\n\u201cWe still see some success in parts of the North West, in particular in certain areas of the Wirral, where property prices are lower and demand is steady,\u201d says Liam Gretton, Bespoke Estate Agent. \u201cBuyers are also looking in areas with planned regeneration, where prices are starting to rise.\u201d\nWhile there are general regional patterns of flip profitability, Walker believes it\u2019s more likely that a good hyper-local knowledge will help you find a suitable property.\n\u201cYou need to understand which streets, which styles of homes, and which improvements genuinely add value in your patch. Forget national \u2018hotspots.\u2019 Success comes from knowing your area inside out and running the numbers with zero room for guesswork.\u201d\nWhat types of houses are good for flipping?\nIn terms of what makes a successful flip property, many of the age-old rules still hold true. \u201cProbate sales, long-held family homes or rentals that haven\u2019t been touched in decades are the sweet spot. Dated kitchens, pink bathrooms, swirly carpets, all perfect,\u201d suggests Walker.\nWith the cost of renovations high, you\u2019re looking for properties that have good bones, are structurally sound and just need cosmetic modifications.\nWith the age of first-time buyers increasing, larger, family homes are increasingly in demand and, therefore, have more flip potential.\n\u201cInvestors looking to flip property should focus on three- or four-bedroom semi-detached houses. These homes tend to appeal to families and young professionals, increasing the likelihood of a quicker sale and a stronger return,\u201d says Marshall-Roberts. \u201cTerraced houses and standard flats in residential blocks can also make good flip candidates.\u201d\nIn contrast, luxury homes with large stamp duty bills come with higher stakes attached.\n\u201cHigh-end homes or unusual properties are harder to flip quickly and carry more risk,\u201d says Gretton.\nWhile flipping can be seen as a way of making a fast buck, Gretton flags that there are hidden benefits and that it has its place in the property market. \u201cIt brings older or neglected homes back to life, creating more modern, liveable spaces that are ready for today\u2019s buyers or renters. It also helps maintain and support local property values especially in areas where tired housing stock might otherwise drag the market down.\u201d"

      "text": "The Bank of England (BoE) has cut interest rates to 4%, the fifth cut in a year, as the UK economy struggles amid high inflation and a stagnant jobs market.\nThe monetary policy committee (MPC) voted by a majority of 5\u20134 to reduce the Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%, rather than maintaining it at 4.25%.\nAndrew Bailey, BoE governor, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve cut interest rates today, but it was a finely balanced decision. Interest rates are still on a downward path, but any future rate cuts will need to be made gradually and carefully.\u201d\nThe unprecedented split saw governor Bailey force the MPC to vote twice after a deadlocked initial vote. It was the first time in MPC history that the committee had to hold two rate votes.\nFive members of its rate-setting committee \u2013 Bailey, deputy governor Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, deputy governor Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor \u2013 voted to reduce interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%.\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: Stocks rise as Trump tariffs take effect and Bank of England cuts rates\nTaylor wanted a deeper cut of half a percentage point, which would have cut rates to 3.75%.\nMegan Greene, deputy governor Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and chief economist Huw Pill voted to maintain interest rates at 4.25%.\nThe 25 basis point reduction is expected to ease pressure on mortgage holders and homebuyers, potentially unlocking more affordable borrowing options.\nThis move brings borrowing costs back to levels not seen since March 2023, the lowest in two years.\nFinancial markets had largely anticipated the cut, with analysts forecasting at least one more reduction later this year, likely in November.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said: \u201cThis fifth interest rate cut since the election is welcome news, helping bring down the cost of mortgages and loans for families and businesses.\n\u201cThe stability we have brought to the public finances through our Plan for Change has helped make this possible and helped us become the fastest growing economy in the G7 in the first quarter of this year. We\u2019re locking in this growth in the long run by investing over \u00a3113bn in infrastructure, securing three major trade deals and embracing the technologies of the future \u2013 to drive up wages and improve living standards across the UK.\"\nOfficial data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed that UK unemployment had increased to 4.7% for the three months to May, its highest level in four years. Meanwhile, average earnings growth, excluding bonuses, slowed to 5%, the weakest growth in almost three years.\nThe jobless rate was slightly higher, wage growth has weakened, and redundancies have been elevated, he said.\nBoE governor Andrew Bailey last month said the Bank would be ready to cut rates further if the labour market showed signs of continued weakening.\nThe UK economy also contracted in April and May, adding pressure on policymakers to continue easing borrowing costs.\nSanjay Raja, senior UK economist for Deutsche Bank, said the economy has been \u201cweaker than the MPC anticipated\u201d since it last published a Monetary Policy Report in May.\nRead more: UK house prices rise by over \u00a31,000 in July\nThe BoE expects prices to continue to rise with inflation expected to peak in September even as it agreed to cut interest rates to 4%.\nThe BoE said inflation had increased in recent months owing to rising energy and food prices and high wage growth and was expected to reach a high point next month.\nThe Committee said: \u201cCPI inflation is forecast to increase slightly further to peak at 4% in September. Inflation is expected to fall back thereafter towards the 2% target, although the Committee remains alert to the risk that this temporary increase in inflation could put additional upward pressure on the wage and price-setting process.\n\u201cOverall, the MPC judges that the upside risks around medium-term inflationary pressures have moved slightly higher since May.\u201d\nVictor Trokoudes, founder and CEO of smart money app Plum, said: \u201cToday\u2019s decision by the BoE to cut the base rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4% had been broadly expected. The previous vote had seen a 6-3 split, so there was already significant demand among the committee for a rate reduction.\u201d\nTrokoudes added: \u201cThis decision may come as a surprise to some, since the latest inflation reading was 3.6%, well ahead of the central bank\u2019s target of 2%, as well as the Bank\u2019s focus on a \u2018gradual and careful approach\u2019 to decreasing rates. What will have concerned the central bank most about the inflation reading was food prices being a key driver of the rise.\n\u201cThere are still large levels of concern about how much impact US tariffs will have on the global economy, even though the UK appears to be among the countries better positioned to navigate this.\"\nFor borrowers, the BoE's rate cut is a welcome development, especially for those with variable-rate mortgages or tracker loans. A lower base rate means reduced repayments for those looking to borrow. However, many re-mortgagers will likely face new, higher rates than those they were previously on, despite the reduction in the base rate.\nAccording to Rightmove (RMV.L), the typical first-time buyer's mortgage payment is now nearly \u00a3100 less per month compared to a year ago. Yet, despite this, the reduction in mortgage rates has largely stalled in recent months, with the quoted interest rate on a two-year fixed mortgage (LTV 75%) rising from 4.19% in May to 4.32% in June.\nAlice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest by Evelyn Partners, said: \u201cFirst-time buyers, homeowners with large mortgages due for refinancing, and heavily indebted borrowers are likely to feel the greatest relief from easing borrowing costs. Savers, on the other hand, may be disappointed by the prospect of lower returns on their savings.\n\u201cWhile the worst of the cost of living crisis is now behind us, consumers have been hit by a barrage of bill hikes in recent months. The BoE suggests the recent jump in prices is temporary with inflation expected to peak at 4% in September before easing back again \u2013 but consumers should not breathe a sigh of relief just yet. US President Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing tariff war and simmering geopolitical tensions continue to pose risks to global growth and price stability.\"\nRead more: This bank has the cheapest mortgage rate for first-time buyers this week\nMark Hicks, head of active savings at Hargreaves Lansdown, advised savers to look for the best rates, which are often offered by smaller banks, building societies, and fintechs.\nHe said: \u201cAt the moment, unusually, the most competitive fixed terms currently have lower headline rates than the most competitive easy-access deals\u2026 We think easy-access rates could fall towards 4%. Fixed-rate deals, however, could remain relatively stable, eventually offering higher rates than easy-access products.\u201d\nFor those with savings, Hicks recommended locking in higher rates for a longer term if they don\u2019t need immediate access to their funds.\nLooking ahead, markets expect the base rate to fall further, with projections suggesting a drop to 3.5% by spring 2026. Further cuts could come in November and February.\nLaith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell, said: \u201cIf it plays out this way, it would surely go down as the tidiest rate-cutting cycle on record, especially in light of what\u2019s going on in the world outside of Threadneedle Street.\u201d\nHowever, Khalaf cautioned that the outlook remains uncertain. \u201cThe effects of tariffs on the global economy, the unpredictable prospects for energy prices, and a tricky autumn budget in the UK are just three factors that will weigh on the direction of interest rates from here.\u201d\nRead more: IMF wants Bank of England to ease interest rates 'gradually'\nIn the US, the Federal Reserve has defied calls from Trump for an interest rate cut by leaving it unchanged.\nThe decision, which was widely expected, left the Fed's key lending rate between 4.25% and 4.5%, where it has stood since December.\nIn Europe, the European Central Bank (ECB) has held its benchmark interest rate steady at 2%.\nThe decision came as no surprise after ECB president Christine Lagarde indicated last month that the central bank had \u201cnearly concluded\u201d its latest rate-cutting cycle.\nCentral banks typically lower interest rates when the economy is struggling and raises them if the pace of price rises starts increasing too quickly.\nThe Bank of England's next meeting will take place on 18 September.\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

Over the past decade, the average return for stocks and shares has been around 9%.\nThe Treasury\u2019s figures suggest that a \u00a32,000 investment today could grow to \u00a312,000 over 20 years, compared to just \u00a32,700 if it remained in a cash account offering 1.5% interest. This highlights a potential \u00a39,000 difference for savers willing to switch.\nFor savers who are cautious about tax, the government allows up to \u00a320,000 a year in tax-free savings and investments within an individual savings account (ISA). The Treasury is pushing to incentivise further investing by making it more accessible and promoting higher returns for savers.\nHowever, with higher returns come higher risks. Historically, many savers have been reluctant to invest due to concerns over the fluctuating value of investments. In response, the Treasury has suggested that specific risk warnings on investment products might be revised. It said there would be a \"review of risk warnings on investment products to make sure they help people to accurately judge risk levels\".\nAn industry-led advertising campaign will explain the benefits of investing. From April 2026, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will introduce Targeted Support, enabling banks to alert customers about specific investment opportunities. This will help shift money from low-return current accounts to higher-performing stocks and shares investments.\nRead more: First-time buyers on \u00a330k salary now able to apply for mortgage"

      "text": "The annual inflation rate in the UK unexpectedly rose to 3.6% in June from 3.4% in May on higher transport prices, particularly fuel, in a troubling sign for policymakers at the Bank of England.\nThe consumer price index (CPI) has now reached its highest level in 18 months. It had been expected to remain unchanged from 3.4%, where it had stood for the previous two months.\nThe core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, was also higher than expected, climbing to 3.7% from 3.5%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nThe rising cost of motor fuels was the most significant contributor to the jump in CPI. Food inflation has increased for a third month in a row to its highest level in more than a year at 4.5%, the ONS said.\nONS acting chief economist Richard Heys said: \u201cInflation ticked up in June, driven mainly by motor fuel prices, which fell only slightly, compared with a much larger decrease at this time last year.\n\u201cFood price inflation has increased for the third consecutive month to its highest annual rate since February of last year. However, it remains well below the peak seen in early 2023.\u201d\nRead more: Bank of England governor warns tariff hikes risk 'fragmenting the world economy'\nBread, cereals, and cake, along with meat, and milk, cheese and eggs (mainly cheddar cheese) went up in price. These were partially offset by small downward effects from chocolate products, as well as fruit juice.\nThe Bank of England expects inflation, which has accelerated since April due to higher energy prices, to peak at 3.7% before falling back to its 2% target.\nThe Monetary Policy Committee has cut interest rates twice this year, from 4.75% to 4.25%. Markets are betting on another quarter-point cut next month.\nRichard Flax, chief investment officer at MoneyFarm, said of the ONS data: \"This puts the BoE in a difficult spot. On one hand, the persistence of services inflation and strong wage growth argue against premature easing. On the other, weakening growth and a softening labour market make the case for caution against holding rates too high for too long.\nMarkets still expect the BoE to begin cutting rates later this year, but the path ahead is far from straightforward. Today\u2019s data reinforces that while inflation isn't reaccelerating, the drag from tight policy is becoming harder to ignore. The question is \u2014 when do concerns over weakening job market and anaemic growth trump inflation?\u201d\nGovernor Andrew Bailey had indicated this week that policymakers might look past inflation data when he said the Bank would lower borrowing costs if they begin to see signs of weakness in the jobs market."

      "text": "The UK inflation rate fell to 2.8% in the year to February, in a boost to chancellor Rachel Reeves as she prepares to deliver a high-stakes spring statement.\nThe latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) come as Reeves is set to outline more than \u00a310 billion of spending cuts in an attempt to repair a hole in the public finances caused by anaemic growth and higher borrowing costs.\nEconomists had expected inflation to remain unchanged, having jumped from 2.5% in December to 3% in January.\nIt remains above the 2% target set by the Bank of England, which expects inflation to hit 3.7% in the third quarter of this year.\nONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said: \"Inflation eased in February. Clothing prices, particularly for women\u2019s clothes, were the biggest driver for this month\u2019s fall. This was only partially offset by small increases, for example, from alcoholic drinks.\"\nOverall prices for clothing and footwear fell by 0.6% in the 12 months to February, compared with a rise of 1.8% in the year to January.\nRead more: How to protect your money from rising bills and taxes from April\nFebruary\u2019s figure was the first negative annual rate since October 2021, as retailers offered more discounts as they tried to shift stock.\nAhead of the spring statement, Rachel Reeves has pledged that her mission is \u201csecurity for working people and renewal for our country\u201d.\nCore inflation, which excludes food, alcohol and tobacco, also fell in February, easing to 3.5% from 3.7% in January. But services inflation, a key indicator of domestic price pressures, was unchanged at 5%.\nDarren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"Our number one mission is kick-starting growth to raise living standards for working people, that is why we are protecting working people\u2019s payslips from higher taxes.\n\"In a changing world, we\u2019re focused on delivering economic stability to secure people\u2019s finances \u2014 freezing fuel duty, protecting the triple lock and increasing the national living wage by \u00a31,400 a year for full-time workers, while going further and faster to drive growth through our Plan for Change.\"\nReeves is due to deliver her spring statement today at around 12.30pm. The chancellor has been focused on bringing down the cost of living and growing the UK economy, but the latest data has shown the economy has actually shrunk."

Despite this, some savings accounts still offer rates above inflation, prompting experts to advise consumers to shop around for better deals. Additionally, the government plans to encourage investment in stocks and shares to help savers achieve higher returns, as many currently hold cash in low-interest accounts.",
