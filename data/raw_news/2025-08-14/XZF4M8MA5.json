  "content": "A Staten Island man and his mother are facing a slew of charges, including aggravated manslaughter and hindering apprehension, after authorities say he caused a deadly crash in Plainsboro, New Jersey during a dangerous BMW street race.\n\nAlvi Limani, 20, is charged with aggravated manslaughter, vehicular homicide, multiple counts of reckless assault by auto, endangering others, obstruction, tampering with records, leaving the scene of a fatal crash, and causing death or serious injury while driving with a revoked license.\n\nHis mother, Vilma Vneshta, 42, is charged with hindering in the third degree. Both are being held at the Middlesex County Adult Correctional Center without bail.\n\nNew Jersey State Police (NJSP) responded to Garden State Parkway south just after 7 p.m. on June 29 and found Albion Hysenaj, 20, of Staten Island, and another 20-year-old Staten Island resident, who were ejected from their car.\n\nHysenaj and the 20-year-old were taken to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, but Hysenaj was later pronounced dead, according to NJSP. The 20-year-old suffered serious injuries.\n\nThe Middlesex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office determined two BMW cars were racing on the Garden State Parkway when the crash happened.\n\nLimani was allegedly driving one of the BMWs recklessly and racing on the Garden State Parkway when his car hit two other cars and rolled over multiple times, according to arrest warrants. Limani is accused of weaving through traffic and driving 112 miles per hour in a 55 miles per hour speed zone.\n\nPolice said the rollover caused two of Limani's occupants, Hysenaj and the 20-year-old, to be ejected.\n\nFollowing the crash, officials accused Limani and his girlfriend, Emily Harrington, 19, of Staten Island, of leaving the scene.\n\nFORMER COP MOM SLAMS POLICIES THAT LET ILLEGAL ALIEN ALLEGEDLY STRIKE SON IN HIT-AND-RUN: \u2018A LOT OF PROBLEMS\u2019\n\nHarrington, who was in the passenger seat, is charged with hindering, obstruction and conspiracy to endanger another person.\n\nThe other alleged BMW street-racer, Jeter Ogando, 23, of Perth Amboy, is charged with second-degree vehicular homicide, endangering another person and assault by auto.\n\nDays after the crash, detectives realized Limani fled to Miami in an attempt to leave the country with his mother, Vneshta.\n\nThe pair were arrested on July 17 near Miami, Florida, and detectives noted they purchased both a Florida ID, same-day passport, and plane tickets to Tirana, Albania.\n\nVideo footage showed Limani and Vneshta being cuffed on the tarmac.\n\nAccording to jail records, both Limani and Vneshta are listed as non-citizens.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Vneshta is Albanian and [is] believed to still have roots there,\" detectives wrote in an affidavit.\n\nThe mother-son duo are currently being held at the Middlesex County Department of Corrections, according to jail records.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office did not immediately respond to inquiries from Fox News Digital.",

      "text": "A Michigan mother is heartbroken again after the teenager who killed her son in a 2023 car crash was spared prison time during his sentencing last week.\nGrosse Pointe police initially responded to the single-vehicle crash on Nov. 17, 2023, and located the defendant, Kiernan Tague, belted into the driver's seat, and the 18-year-old victim, Flynn MacKrell, unresponsive and belted into the passenger seat.\nProsecutors accused Tague of driving about 100 mph in a 25-mph zone around 9 p.m. when he crashed the vehicle into a telephone pole.\nThe defendant was initially charged with second-degree murder but later pleaded guilty to manslaughter with a motor vehicle with an adult designation in February 2025 and was given a \"blended sentence\" last week due to his age at the time of the crash: 16.\nTague, now 18, was sentenced to serve probation at a Level two placement facility, as FOX 2 Detroit reported. Fox News Digital reached out to Tague's attorney for comment.\n\"The evidence in this case will show that the defendant was driving in a residential neighborhood at speeds that rival speeding on Michigan freeways,\" Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said in a June 13 statement. \"Sadly, Mr. MacKrell lost his life as a result. We know that the rules of the road exist for a reason, speed kills. Driving 25 in a residential neighborhood is mandated, not a mere suggestion.\"\nMacKrell's mother, Anne Vanker, of Grosse Pointe, expressed her disappointment with the sentencing results in a June 13 Facebook post.\nMALIBU MAN TO STAND TRIAL FOR MURDER IN HIGH-SPEED CRASH THAT LEFT 4 PEPPERDINE STUDENTS DEAD\n\"Today, instead of being held accountable, Kiernan Tague was once again shielded from facing the full consequences of his violent and criminal actions. He killed my son, Flynn MacKrell, through repeated reckless and destructive behavior, and yet, even after 18 months, the justice system has failed to hold him fully responsible,\" Vanker wrote.\n\"This is not justice.\"\nVanker added that \"[d]espite clear recommendations from two pre-sentencing reports calling for adult sentencing, overwhelming evidence, and the applicable Michigan Court Rules that allow the court to consider the full scope of Kiernan\u2019s behavior, the court chose leniency over accountability.\"\n\"This decision results in a continued injustice for Flynn, our family, and every community that expects real consequences for fatal, preventable actions,\" Vanker said, adding that her family \"will never stop fighting for Flynn\" and \"will continue to advocate for stronger laws.\"\nTEENS' NIGHT OF ROCK THROWING LEADS TO MURDER CONVICTION FOR MAN, NOW 20\n\"My son, my Flynn, was my life, my heart. No words can capture the silence, the rage, and the sorrow that fill every corner of my world. This statement cannot express the hell I live every day since Flynn's death, but Flynn's voice was stolen, now mine must speak for him.\"\nShe also read a victim impact statement in court last week during the sentencing hearing. In her statement, Vanker remembered her son, who had just started studying at the University of Dayton before the crash, as \"a cherished child of God\" and \"a true gift.\"\nShe also described Tague's \"escalating violent behavior\" and \"willful disregard for his mother's authority, the law, and basic human life.\" Vanker added that Tague has never acknowledged \"the gravity of the crime\" and has never expressed \"remorse\" for Flynn's death.\n\"Kiernan Tague has been involved in 20 police incidents since 2018. Most of these police interactions were triggered by Kiernan's mother calling 911 because of his uncontrollable outbursts,\" she wrote.\nTague's driving history in the months before the crash included hitting speeds of 102 mph, 127 mph, 143 mph, 150 mph and 155 mph, the Detroit Free Press reported, citing police reports, cellphone exchanges and Life360 records.\nVanker also noted that Tague's family used the Life 360 app to keep tabs on their son's location, as many parents do, and a search warrant for data from the app showed Tague's reckless driving tendencies. Police reports, Life360 records and other documents showed\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"From November 1 to November 17, Kiernan made 94 trips in his car,\" Vanker wrote. \"Of those 94 trips, 10% were over 120 [mph], 18% were over 110 [mph], 26% were over 100 [mph], and 45% were over 90 [mph]. The top speed was recorded on November 1, 2023, when Kiernan Tague traveled at or above 153.7 mph for 20.5 miles.\"\nTague also spoke at his sentencing and at times became choked up when talking about Flynn, whom he described as his best friend, according to FOX 2.\n\"My heart is profoundly heavy with grief, regret and remorse,\" Tague said on June 13, as FOX 2 reported. \"What pains me most is that I know that any pain that I've experienced is nothing compared to what Flynn's loved ones, especially his parents, sister, brother, and family have experienced.\""

      "text": "A former police officer is pleading for the illegal immigrant who nearly killed her son in a hit-and-run on his 21st birthday to stop hiding and own up to his crime.\n\"I keep saying it doesn't go back to if you're legal or illegal or any of that stuff. It's not a race thing. It is not any of that. It's called being a decent human being,\" Sheena Carach, the mother of Zach Carach, who is still hospitalized, told Fox News Digital.\n\"It's about right and wrong. And if you hit someone, you stop. I mean, that's just what you do. It's inhumane not to stop. I don't care who you are. That makes you a monster.\"\nSheena Carach's life was altered May 19 while she and her family were visiting Nashville from Florida to celebrate her son's 21st birthday. After brunch and touring Music City, she said her son was struck by a speeding car while he was attempting to cross a street, and the driver sped away.\nMANHUNT UNDERWAY FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WANTED IN SERIOUS NASHVILLE HIT-AND-RUN\n\"I can say in that moment, my heart left my body,\" Carach recalled. \"I mean, I can clearly see myself running in the video. I know that happened. I was there, but I don't know how I was even breathing because I immediately thought I had just saw my child be killed. I thought I had lost my child. I ran to him, and I just started praying.\"\nWeeks after his near-death encounter, Nashville police announced the suspect wanted in the case was Tony Lopez-Infante, 32, an illegal immigrant from Venezuela who remains at large.\nWATCH: Video shows hit-and-run crash involving illegal suspect in Nashville\nA spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) confirmed that Lopez-Infante entered the U.S. illegally in August 2023 and \"has a final order of removal.\"\nAlong with the hit-and-run, police noted that Lopez-Infante has several outstanding warrants, including one in Williamson County for a probation violation for a theft arrest.\nPolice said the vehicle involved in the accident, a Mitsubishi Mirage, was returned by Lopez-Infante, with front-end damage, to a rental business in Mt. Juliet May 19.\nHomeland Security shared a post on X, stating, \"The Biden Administration released this illegal alien into our country in 2023.\n\"This crime was preventable and is the direct result of open border policies that prioritized illegal aliens over the safety of American citizens.\"\n\"Officers located the car there the next day, on May 20. Investigation resulted in Lopez-Infante of Venezuela being identified as the hit-and-run driver,\" police said.\nCarach said her son would \"never have gotten hit\" if Lopez-Infante would \"not have been allowed to rent a vehicle illegally.\"\n\"He rented a car in February of this year that he had until he hit my son with no driver's license, with no insurance, without a major credit card on file. I mean, I wouldn't be able to walk into a business and do that,\" she said, after she ran her own investigation into her son's near-fatal crash.\n\"I have to be 25. I have to have a license. I have to have insurance. I have to have a major card to rent a vehicle, but he just did it. And he paid cash every week, $200 every single week to rent this car. So, knowingly driving without a license, knowingly driving without insurance and he was just allowed to do this. There's a lot of problems with that.\"\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANT HELD WITHOUT BAIL IN DEATH OF UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA STUDENT\nCarach added that what was even more frustrating was Lopez-Infante showed no concern about hitting her son.\n\"You know what you did, and you don't care at all? And you haven't come forward. To even try to \u2026 not that you could make it right at this point, but to even say like, 'Hey, I'm sorry for what I did.' He has no remorse in my eyes. He's a monster,\" she said.\nCarach said that her son will be using a wheelchair the next two months and is hopeful there is no permanent damage.\n\"I will say it was a hard one for me when this first happened, and I didn't feel like things were going as they should go. And I will say \u2026 that I won't put that on the police department. I'll put that on the mayor and everything that's been brought to my attention,\" Carach explained.\nShe was referring to the backlash Nashville Mayor Freddie O\u2019Connell, a Democrat, has received.\nU.S. Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., said O'Connell \"condemned ICE\u2019s good work, promoted a fund to provide support dollars for illegal immigrants and their families in Nashville and even updated an executive order to fast-track the collection of all Nashville government employees\u2019 interactions with ICE.\"\n\"It is indefensible that blue city mayors like Mayor O\u2019Connell in Nashville have violated their oath of office by prioritizing illegal aliens over the law-abiding citizens they were elected to serve,\" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., told Fox News Digital.\n\"The illegal alien wanted for a hit-and-run in Nashville that left a 21-year-old man wheelchair-bound is exactly the type of person the mayor is protecting. Mayors across the country have a choice: help get these people off our streets or jeopardize the safety of their residents.\"\nO'Connell declined to comment to Fox News Digital.\nLaw enforcement officials said that federal partners, including Homeland Security Investigations, are helping in the ongoing efforts to locate Lopez-Infante.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"For us, this has just been an ongoing nightmare. To know that this guy, that we've seen his face, we know who he is, he's out there walking around free and then every single day we're sitting by our son's hospital bed,\" Carach said. \"So, for us, it's kind of a little bit freeing, I guess, that you know they have now finally released his face to the public, and we can have that extra help in finding him.\"\nStepheny Price is a writer for Fox News Digital and Fox Business.
