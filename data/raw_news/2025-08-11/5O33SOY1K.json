  "title": "Google's cancelled Pixel Tablet Pen mysteriously appears on Amazon",
  "description": "The Pixel Tablet Pen was never officially released, but that hasn't stopped it from recently appearing on several online marketplaces.",
  "content": "Google never officially announced the Pixel Tablet Pen, but several reliable rumors back in 2023 pointed to its existence. However, it never received an official release and was reportedly canceled by the tech giant.\n\nFast-forward a few years, and out of nowhere, you can now buy the Pixel Tablet Pen on Amazon (via 9to5Google). The pen features a low-key off-white design with gray accents, alongside a physical button, a USB-C charging port, and the model number \"GM0KF.\"\n\nWhile it's still unclear, it looks like the unreleased accessory hit some level of official production, though its odd Google allowed the stylus to get in the hands of third-party sellers given its very clear branding on the pen.\n\nAs far as styluses go, the Pixel Tablet Pen is supposed to be pretty good\n\nIt's definitely a Google Product if its branding is any indication\n\nAlong with Amazon (where the pen is currently listed as unavailable), 9to5Google says the Pixel Pen has also appeared on China-based platform \"Goofish\" and a few other online marketplaces for roughly $25. The Pixel Pen rarely has its official name attached to it, and instead, features a listing that describes it as a generic USI 2.0 stylus. That said, listing pictures show a \"Designed for Google\" logo on the pen and its packaging (for a closer look at the Pixel Pen, check out 9to5Google's story).\n\nThe publication says the Pixel Pen it purchased is responsive, fluid, and functions just as you would expect a stylus to. It also responds to inputs when you hover over on-screen buttons. Unfortunately, the button on the side of the Pixel Tablet Pen doesn't seem to do anything.\n\nGoogle's Pixel Tablet released back in 2023 for $400 for the 128GB version. Rumors point to the Pixel Tablet 2 being cancelled by Google, with hints that a third-generation version might still arrive in 2027. It's unclear why the Pixel Tablet Pen never saw the light of day, but it could be due to the tablet reportedly not selling well.",

      "text": "For those waiting for a Pixel Tablet 2, it's been a frustrating few weeks. First, we heard reports that the third-gen Pixel Tablet \u2014 a device in the works for 2027 \u2014 was dead in the water, with the second-gen model serving as a lame duck conclusion to the lineup. Just hours later, we learned that the Pixel Tablet 3 had not been killed, but the Pixel Tablet 2 was dead, leaving Google's most recent slate to flounder for several years to come.\nAlthough we'd previously heard about keyboard accessories for the Pixel Tablet 2 \u2014 something woefully missing on the first-gen model \u2014 today's report from Android Authority paints a much clearer picture on what this device was supposed to be. It's a big pivot away from the smart home-centric first-gen model, and in my eyes, a total misunderstanding of what made the original Pixel Tablet special. If Google ever wants to reinvest in the tablet space again (or, you know, the laptop space), I'm hoping it learns some valuable lessons from this cancelation.\nThese leaked Pixel Tablet 2 specs paint a confusing picture\nWhat was Google trying to accomplish here?\nAP's Google Editor Taylor Kerns already did a remarkable job summarizing what the Pixel Tablet 2 was likely to be before its (admittedly still rumored) untimely death, but if you missed the news, here's the quick jist. According to Kamila Wojciechowska at Android Authority, Google's next slate was supposed to include a slightly brighter, 120Hz display, improved camera sensors, 5G support, and DisplayPort connectivity, all packed inside a familiar form factor and powered by the Pixel 9's Tensor G4. All this, plus a Thread radio for direct control of supported smart home gadgets.\nTo the enthusiast community, these upgrades read like a checklist of what the original Pixel Tablet was lacking. A 120Hz display would've brought the Pixel Tablet 2 closer to its Samsung-branded competition (and exceed what Apple offers in all but its most expensive devices). Google's Tensor G4 is a much better chipset than the first-gen slate's Tensor G2, even if some die-hard Android fans are stuck waiting for the rumored TSMC-made Tensor G5. And additions like DisplayPort connectivity and optional 5G support suggest the Pixel Tablet 2 would've been the productivity machine its predecessor was not.\nI'm sure some of you are saying out loud that, yes, these are exactly the sort of changes you'd expect in a sequel. Yet, for all of Google's potential hardware improvements, the Pixel Tablet 2's core identity seems as half-baked as its predecessor. Is this a tablet designed to compete with the iPad, or is this the future of the Nest Hub lineage, as the first-gen Pixel Tablet suggested? Google's inability to decide in either direction is likely why the product's dead in the first place.\nSeriously, look at this list. Aside from the addition of a Thread radio, what here helps to achieve the original Pixel Tablet's pitch? 5G, display output, and keyboard accessories effectively accomplish nothing towards building a hybrid tablet-smart display. Neither does a faster refresh rate or improved camera sensors, even if the former seems like a no-brainer. This entire list ignores what the Pixel Tablet was designed to be from the jump: a new, more flexible take on 2019's Nest Hub Max, while simultaneously being too scared to cut away from its smart home origins altogether.\nInstead, it seems like Google was gearing up to launch a much less interesting product as a result, while simultaneously keeping the dated, bulky design from last year's model. No one would've been taking this thing to a cafe or on a plane as their main productivity device, especially when its 11-inch display is practically tiny in a world full of 12-to-15-inch tablets.\nGoogle should've leaned into smart home with the Pixel Tablet 2\nThat might be why it got canceled in the first place\nThread support would be a nice improvement, but when I think of what the Pixel Tablet 2 needed to achieve, practically everything on my personal list was ignored. First, I think Google needed to chase a lower price point, and these leaked specs suggest anything but. A 120Hz display and optional 5G support would've just drove the price up, at a time when we've seen the tenth-gen iPad as low as $250. Google needed to find a way to compete with Apple's entry-level hardware, and this doesn't sound like it.\nNext, the speaker. It's not mentioned anywhere in Android Authority's report, which suggests a downplaying \u2014 or, potentially, a full removal \u2014 of the main factor that set the original Pixel Tablet apart from its competition. While I think Google made the right decision in releasing a cheaper, dockless version of its slate to retailers, it's just as frustrating to hear nothing about the Pixel Tablet 2's speaker. After all, its problems were with the execution, not the concept.\nImproving its speaker quality, reinforcing its magnetic connection with the tablet, and adding native cast support to the dock itself would've made for a killer accessory, something to really help the Pixel Tablet 2 stand out among the crowd. Meanwhile, Hub Mode is begging for improvements, especially in a Gemini-focused landscape where Nest displays are aging like milk in front of our eyes. If we aren't going to get a Nest Hub Max 2, this is where Google should be focusing its efforts.\nIt's not that Google's initial approach to a second-gen tablet was bad, but this report just shows a lack of vision on the company's part. Was this supposed to be a productivity device, something akin to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Tab S10+ or the iPad Pro? Was it meant to live in the kitchen or living room as a smart home hub, replacing a Nest Hub while doubling as an easy way to browse through TikTok? This list of proposed changes suggests Google didn't really know, and that should scare any fan of the company's products.\nHere's hoping Google has a future with tablets\nOne a little more well thought out\nNo matter why Google decided to kill the Pixel Tablet 2, it's probably for the best. If Google does decide to stick it out in the tablet market with what would have been the Pixel Tablet 3, it needs to think long and hard about what this hardware is trying to accomplish before pouring resources into development. Considering the impact the Pixel 9 is having on the smartphone space, now is not the time for bold experimentation and wacky, untested ideas. More than ever, Google needs a cohesive vision, and considering all we've heard on the Pixel Tablet 2, that's simply not what was bound to end up on store shelves."

      "text": "The Pixel Tablet, unlike the bulk of other tablets on the market today, was never given an ecosystem of accessories to improve the experience, but that doesn\u2019t mean Google never tried. It was clear through a series of leaks that Google was working on a \u201cPixel Tablet Pen,\u201d but it never saw a proper release. Despite that, though, you can just go buy one on Amazon today.\nLate last year a \u201cPen for Pixel Tablet\u201d surfaced as an official stylus option for the Google Pixel Tablet. The stylus carried the model number GM0KF and had a subdued design featuring off-white and grey colors, as well as a physical button that could interact with the software. The stylus was expected to work over USI 2.0, which the Pixel Tablet has supported from the beginning.\nGoogle never ended up releasing the stylus, but it\u2019s now clear that there was some level of production, because units are just about everywhere.\nThe \u201cPixel Tablet Pen\u201d has been quietly finding its way to the market, just not via Google. We were alerted to the \u201cPixel Tablet Pen\u201d appearing on the Chinese marketplace \u201cGoofish.\u201d There, a listing for the stylus not only shows it in the flesh, but even shows a Google-branded box that confirms it was to be called the \u201cPixel Tablet Pen,\u201d not the \u201cPen for Pixel Tablet\u201d as had previously been hinted at.\nBeyond that marketplace, the Pixel Tablet Pen is just on sale all over the web, most readily on Amazon.\nThere are several different sellers offering the Pixel Tablet Pen not by its actual name, but as a generic USI 2.0 stylus carrying Google\u2019s GM0KF model number. Yet, these styluses (or styli) are actually ones that appear to have come from Google\u2019s own production run. Not only do they carry the model number, but also a \u201cDesigned for Google\u201d badge and Google\u2019s own logo on the button.\nWe purchased this Pixel Tablet Pen in particular for about $25, but there are around a dozen listings in the same price bracket. It\u2019s a pretty good deal for a USI 2.0 stylus already, but even more so when you consider this was probably destined to be a much more expensive first-party Google accessory.\nSo, how does it work?\nThe short version is that it works exactly as you\u2019d expect it to.\nThe stylus has a USB-C charging port with a status light, and charges up pretty quickly. As soon as it\u2019s got some juice, you can bring it up to your Pixel Tablet\u2019s display it immediately functions. Input is responsive and fluid, the software responds to when you hover over buttons, and there are no headaches anywhere.\n\u201cIt just works.\u201d\nTop comment by Huy Tran\nThis is pretty wild indeed. You expect to see unreleased prototypes floating around and perhaps even on sale but to see full retail boxes that could've been on store shelves?\nStrange move to pull the plug on it if it went all the way through testing and production, packaging etc. At least give them to employees/development teams as freebies (maybe they did... and they still had leftovers).\nThe button, sadly, doesn\u2019t seem to do anything, but it\u2019s a nice fidget toy at bare minimum with a satisfying little click.\nWhat\u2019s the deal with this stylus, though? It\u2019s one thing for Google to have a few units of an unreleased product floating around \u2013 if anything it\u2019s a time-honored tradition at this point \u2013 but you can just go over to Amazon and buy a Pixel Tablet Pen from random sellers. JR Raphael over at ComputerWorld also got his hands on one of these recently (presumably in the same manner, though he didn\u2019t mention) and asked Google about the product, but the company didn\u2019t offer any comment on the product\u2019s existence.\nI doubt we\u2019ll ever get clear answers on the story of this stylus, especially as the Pixel Tablet\u2019s future is in limbo, but I\u2019m pretty glad to have my hands on this weird little piece of Google history. You can head over to Amazon to find one for yourself, but I\u2019m not sure how many are out there, so act sooner than later.\nMore on Google Pixel:\n- Some Pixel Tablet accessories we can\u2019t live without [Video]\n- I want the next Pixel Tablet to revisit the past \u2013 what do you want in a sequel?\n- The Pixel Tablet\u2019s future is murky, but I hope sequels don\u2019t lose the charm\nFollow Ben: Twitter/X, Threads, Bluesky, and Instagram\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "In a move just slightly atypical of an IP-protective company like Google, an accessory it never officially released is now showing up across online retailers \u2014 unannounced, unsupported, and actually kind of awesome. Say hello (again) to the Pixel Tablet Pen, the stylus that was supposed to launch alongside the Pixel Tablet but got quietly scrapped before hitting store shelves. Or so we thought (Source: 9to5Google).\nThe Pixel Tablet Pen is dead. Long live the Pixel Tablet Pen\nYou can buy one right now\nReunited and it feels so good. Stylus images courtesy of Ben Schoon at 9to5Google.\nDespite Google never formally announcing or shipping this accessory, the Pixel Tablet Pen has started appearing for sale across Amazon, Goofish (a Chinese marketplace), and other sketchy-but-functional corners of the web. The kicker? These aren\u2019t knockoffs. These are seemingly legit units from Google\u2019s own production run.\nIt certainly appears to be authentic Google hardware.\nBack in late 2023, a \u201cPen for Pixel Tablet\u201d with model number GM0KF surfaced in regulatory filings and leaks. Designed to work over USI 2.0, which the Pixel Tablet supports natively, the pen had an understated, off-white design, a side-mounted button, and a USB-C port for charging. Pretty standard stuff for a first-party accessory. But then, radio silence. Google never mentioned it publicly again.\nNow it\u2019s 2025, and you can grab one of these unreleased styluses for about $25 on Amazon. Listings typically describe it as a generic USI 2.0 stylus, but the hardware tells a different story. Units still carry the GM0KF model number, Google\u2019s logo on the button, and a \u201cDesigned for Google\u201d label on the box. This isn\u2019t some third-party clone. This was Google's actual pen, made in actual factories, just never sold through actual channels.\nI'm honestly a little surprised Google shipped these out to the open third-party market with all that clear branding.\nIn testing, the stylus does exactly what you\u2019d expect. Input is smooth and accurate, hover detection works, and setup is instant\u2014no pairing necessary. It even charges over USB-C with a status light to let you know when it\u2019s juiced up. The one bummer? The physical button doesn\u2019t appear to do anything. Maybe it was meant for app shortcuts or input toggles, but right now it\u2019s just a clicky fidget switch.\nSo, why did Google kill it? Who knows? Google\u2019s accessory support for the Pixel Tablet has been weak since day one, and the stylus probably got the axe during one of the company\u2019s frequent hardware strategy reshuffles. No official word has come from Mountain View, and at this point, none is expected.\n- SoC\n- Google Tensor G2\n- Display type\n- IPS LCD, 60Hz\nPart tablet, part Nest Hub Max, Google's Pixel Tablet is still the company's flagship large-screen Android offering.

  "argos_summary": "The Pixel Tablet Pen, an accessory that Google never officially released, has unexpectedly surfaced for sale on various online platforms, including Amazon and Goofish. Despite its cancellation, the pen, which features a low-key design and is compatible with USI 2.0, appears to be authentic Google hardware from a production run. While it functions well as a stylus, the side button lacks any functionality, raising questions about why Google allowed its distribution without a formal launch.",
