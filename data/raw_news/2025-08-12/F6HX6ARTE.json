He\u2019s making it hard for me,\u201d Washington said about Jones on Tuesday. \u201cNot to be a fan, because I\u2019m still a Cowboys fan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still going to have the star on the side of the hat, but he ain\u2019t thinking about us. He\u2019s thinking about his pocket.\u201d",

      "text": "Travis Kelce\u2026 Browns tight end?\nWell, if he had it his way over a decade ago, that\u2019s how his career might have shaken out.\nIn the lead-up to the 2013 NFL Draft, Kelce met with the Browns and the team\u2019s then-head coach, Rob Chudzinski, and made clear he wanted one thing \u2014 to be a Cleveland Brown.\nKelce, who went to Cleveland Heights High School and attended the University of Cincinnati, made an emotional plea to try to play for his hometown squad.\n\u201cI cried in [Chudzinski\u2019s] office and said, \u2018I will f\u2013king die for this city!\u2019\u201d Kelce told GQ. \u201cI literally was in tears. I said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m getting emotional. I grew up down the street. I would f\u2013king do anything to play for the Cleveland Browns.\u2019 He looked at me like I was insane. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever had somebody just pour out their emotions.\u201d\nKelce was instead taken in the third round by the Chiefs, the team he has played with for his entire NFL career.\nHe has racked up 10 Pro Bowl and four All-Pro nods and won three Super Bowls as one of the game\u2019s greatest tight ends of all time.\nAs for the Browns, they took linebacker Barkevious Mingo and cornerback Leon McFadden, neither of whom earned a Pro Bowl appearance in their respective careers, though Mingo did win a Super Bowl with the 2016 Patriots.\nKelce, entering his 13th NFL season, recently said he has moved past Super Bowl 2025\u2019s blowout loss to the Eagles.\n\u201cI\u2019ve thrown that thing in the trash,\u201d Kelce told reporters last week.\n\u201cI\u2019ve moved on. It happened sooner than you can imagine. I was pretty focused on this year in the offseason.\u201d"

      "text": "OXNARD, Calif. \u2013 Back in April, DaRon Bland and his representation hadn't started contract extension talks with the Cowboys and instead, he was focused on the season.\nOn Tuesday, Bland said that he and the Cowboys have had \"some talks\" about an extension and hopes to get something done before Dallas opens the season on September 4.\n\"I do, but I'm not here to talk about it really too much,\" Bland said when asked if he wants to get a deal done before the season. \"But yea, hopefully.\"\nThe Cowboys have another decision to make with Bland aside from his extension: where he'll play on the field.\nWith so many injuries at the cornerback position, Bland has spent time on the outside and in the slot. The outside is where Bland was an All-Pro in 2023, but he's growing comfortable in his ability to play in either role.\n\"I feel like I'm pretty adjusted into it now\u2026\" Bland said. \"It's really just gelling everything together both inside and outside and showing I can do both.\"\nWhile Bland moving to the slot corner position would only slide him a few yards from his outside spot, it's still a very different area of the field and comes with it's own set of challenges that he's had to adapt to.\n\"I would say a little bit because there's some different things you've got to watch on the inside versus the outside,\" Bland said. \"The o-line and you tune into the pass at the same time.\"\nThankfully, Bland has had his fair share of reps against high quality opponents in practice. Brian Schottenheimer has lined up CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens all over the field, and Bland getting to work against them keeps him on his toes every rep.\n\"It never lets you get complacent,\" Bland said. \"It always gives you something to work on, because every day there's something to work on. So going against guys like that, you can never sit back.\"\nEven with Bland being the likely option at slot corner especially when Trevon Diggs and Shavon Revel return, there are rookies and young players alike that are vying for snaps at that role. Kemon Hall and Zion Childress are just two names at that position, although other rookies like Shemar James and Ajani Cornelius have stood out to Bland as well.\nAcross the board, his message to the younger players on the roster remains the same.\n\"Keep going,\" Bland said. \"I was the guy that didn't have too many offers out of high school, I had one offer so I went to Sac State, played three years, and then went to Fresno [State] and didn't start until four games into the season. Just stuff like that, just keep going, you'll never know when your opportunity is going to come.\"\nThe opportunity that Bland hopes to come many more times in 2025 than it has in the past is sharing the field with Trevon Diggs, as injuries have limited the number of games both have been on the field.\n\"Always hopeful for both of us to be healthy first of all, and for both of us to show out on the field together. Can't wait until it happens.\" Bland said.\nThe Cowboys are certainly hoping that they can reunite on the field sooner rather than later."

      "text": "ESPN\u2019s Tony Grossi is telling his side of the awkward exchange with Shedeur Sanders after Friday night\u2019s Brown-Panthers preseason game.\nGrossi was confronted by the Browns\u2019 rookie quarterback after the latter impressed during his debut with Cleveland.\n\u201cTony, I be hoping you have something positive to say about me,\u201d Sanders told Grossi in a video posted to Deion Sanders Jr.\u2019s YouTube account. \u201cYou only say negative stuff about me. And I\u2019m like, \u2018I ain\u2019t do nothing to you.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI ain\u2019t hear nothing positive you\u2019ve ever said,\u201d Sanders said with a smile.\n\u201cWhat I do to you, Tony?\u201d Sanders said with a laugh as he walked away.\nOn Monday, the reporter addressed the situation on his self-titled \u201cThe Daily Grossi\u201d show on ESPN Cleveland, saying that he was surprised by Sanders\u2019 comments, although the conversation was \u201cgood-natured.\u201d\n\u201cOne thing to note was that I initiated the conversation,\u201d Grossi said, via Awful Announcing. \u201cHe left the podium to walk to the locker room and I called his name to ask him another question. And that\u2019s when he discussed what was on his mind. I was a little surprised he went into that because as I said, it was inaudible but I said, \u2018Hey, this is your night man. This is a big night for you, have fun.\u2019 But I appreciated the fact that he did not say what was on his mind from the podium, which other quarterbacks have done with me, which is very uncomfortable.\u201d\nThe YouTube video of the back-and-forth being posted by Sanders\u2019 half-brother also took Grossi by surprise.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t appreciate the fact that this interaction was filmed without my knowledge,\u201d Grossi said. \u201cIt turns out, it was his brother, who is documenting everything from his rookie season. That\u2019s fine, just now that I\u2019m aware of it, I\u2019ll be a little more careful and everything. But everybody that saw the video, it was good-natured. I don\u2019t know what caused us to laugh, I really can\u2019t recall that conversation precisely. But we went on good terms.\n\u201cWe had a couple [of] other words in the locker room, too. But I was a little surprised that, on his big night, and it was a big night for him with all of the circumstances, that he would raise this. That\u2019s why I thought he was joking. It shouldn\u2019t have been that big of a deal on his mind after his big night. Anyways, all is good. We saw each other today at practice, and we move on.\u201d\nThe exchange came just minutes after Sanders\u2019 press conference following a 138 passing yard, two-touchdown performance in a 30-10 win over the Panthers.\nAfter the game, Grossi offered the first-year signal-caller the praise he asked for.\n\u201cI thought Shedeur was outstanding,\u201d he said during an appearance on ESPN Cleveland afterwards.\nHe later wrote: \u201cMy bottom line on Shedeur Sanders\u2019 impressive debut: He put the pressure on QB2 Kenny Pickett and QB3 Dillon Gabriel to get healthy and perform next week.\u201d"

Ain\u2019t been to the show, you wouldn\u2019t know\u2026 what it is to win.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I love the Cowboys!\u201d Washington added. \u201cI love the Cowboys.
