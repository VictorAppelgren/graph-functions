  "title": "Demi Lovato Scores Her Debut Top 10 Hit On A Billboard Chart",
  "description": "Demi Lovato debuts at No. 8 on the Hot Dance/Pop Songs chart with \u201cFast,\u201d her first appearance on the recently-introduced ranking.",
  "content": "Demi Lovato has returned to her pop roots after venturing into rock music for a while. The singer is preparing a new album, and she fronts the campaign with a just-released single titled \u201cFast.\u201d Appropriately, the cut becomes a quick win on a handful of Billboard\u2019s genre-specific tallies, and it even helps the Grammy-nominated singer earn her first smash on one recently-introduced ranking.\n\n\u201cFast\u201d launches at No. 8 on the current edition of the Hot Dance/Pop Songs chart. That roster was introduced by Billboard early in 2025, so many famous musicians who have worked and succeeded in the field \u2014 which blends both dance and pop elements \u2014 are playing catch-up, when compared to current stars. Lovato earns her first appearance on the roster as \u201cFast\u201d opens at No. 8.\n\nLovato revs her engines and starts \u201cFast\u201d on four Billboard charts, and it enters the top 10 on exactly half of them. In addition to the Hot Dance/Pop Songs tally, \u201cFast\u201d comes in at No. 4 on the Dance Digital Song Sales list.\n\nThe cut just misses out on the highest tier on the Dance Streaming Songs roster, where it begins its time at No. 11. Lovato also makes it to the Bubbling Under Hot 100, which acts as a 25-spot extension of the main ranking of the most consumed songs in America, where her latest debuts at No. 15.\n\n\u201cOK Not to Be OK,\u201d \u201cSolo\u201d and \u201cNo Promises\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cFast\u201d may be Lovato\u2019s first top 10 on the Hot Dance/Pop Songs chart, its arrival marks her fourth trip to the highest tier on the Dance Digital Song Sales ranking. She has already cracked that lofty tier with \u201cOK Not to Be OK\u201d with Marshmello, \u201cSolo\u201d with Clean Bandit, and \u201cNo Promises\u201d alongside Cheat Codes. The first of those titles is still her sole No. 1, while the other two missed out on ruling by one space.",
