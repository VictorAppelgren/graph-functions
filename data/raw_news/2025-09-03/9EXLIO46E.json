  "title": "Cook Hearing Ends Without Ruling on Fed Governor's Status",
  "description": "Natasha Sarin, president and co-founder of the Yale Budget Lab, said the legal battle over president's bid to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook could pose a risks to keeping the central bank free of political influence. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "You know, it's such a bigger issue than anything about Lisa Cook or anything about mortgages in that you're in a situation where one of the fundamental institutions and sort of causes of American economic strength is the fact that we have an independent central bank that makes monetary policy decisions absent from political influence based only on how it thinks about inflation and how it thinks about the labor market. And what you're seeing here play out is really sort of potentially quite damaging conversation around whether that type of institution should actually be free from political influence. And the reason why I know it's pretty damaging is because we've actually done it before in the United States. We've had a politicized Federal Reserve in the Nixon administration that made great decisions, sort of according to how they would best be suited to help President Nixon win a presidential campaign. The result of that was that we saw the worst stagflation in this country in recent history and inflation rise from 3 to 13%. So we're running some pretty real risks here, and they're quite substantial, and they're much bigger than any one particular individual or any one particular case. So what's the Fed's going to look like six months from now? I hope that the answer to that is not that different than it looks like today. And part of what gives me a little bit of hope is that you're watching this all play out in legal proceedings throughout the judiciary that ultimately will get to the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court went out of its way in a removal case that had nothing to do with the Federal Reserve to signal the importance of the Federal Reserve as an institution and its unique quasi private. It called it role in this economy such that in that particular case, there were real limits on the President's ability to remove at will members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, and particularly the chair of the Federal Reserve. And so I think in some sense, they're laying I hope maybe I'm sort of hoping that they're laying the groundwork for being very explicit here, that this is not a case in which you're going to allow the executive to have unfettered capacity to remove and install political operatives in these roles. But instead, this is a case where the unique exigencies of the Federal Reserve demand that we remain an independent monetary policy institution. Well, I don't know if that's actually. You think that Stephen Myron is going to make the next meeting. There are questions about that. He's got his confirmation hearing next week. Looks like that, in fact, could happen. But Christopher Waller today is again calling for lower rates. He sees a quarter point in September and then more additional cuts over the next 3 to 6 months. The pace driven, of course, by incoming data. You can weigh in on the the rate cut if you want. But there are worries that if President Trump goes through with this and Lisa Cook is, in fact, fired for cause, that you're going to see a big drop in short term interest rates because of a Trump friendly Fed, but that longer term rates are going to keep rising for fear of a greater inflationary trend. How do you see it? You know, it's really interesting. I actually think there is substantial room for debate and you're seeing it among the members of the Federal Reserve Board right now with respect to how to navigate this particular economic moment, because on the one hand, you have the most inflationary policies that we've seen in our lifetimes with respect to tariffs that are at a 18 plus percent effective rate in the economy. And on the other hand, you have a labor market that's starting to cool. And so what you've seen Governor Walker say is he's in the direction of being concerned about the labor market. I will note that even this sort of dissent on the Federal Reserve Board at the moment is about whether you hold rates steady or you cut rates by 25 basis points. That's nowhere near the rate cuts that the president and the administration have called for. And so I think there is room for debate about whether the Fed waits or whether the Fed continues or starts to lower rates. But I actually don't think you're anywhere close or should be anywhere close to some of what the administration has been pushing. But the thing that's really important that you said there, Joe, is sort of the flip side of this, which is like what happens? Let's assume that you're in a world in which the Federal Reserve Board decides tomorrow that we're going to lower interest rates to the 1%, the Fed funds rate to the 1% that President Trump has called for. Well, that's actually not going to do. It's like pretty counterproductive. It's not going to do to mortgage rates what the president might like to see precisely because you might be changing the short term rate at which banks borrow from one another, which is the Fed funds rate that the Fed controls. But you're not actually able to effectuate what mortgage rates or other rates we care about. Small business loan rates are in this economy because that matters a lot with respect to what the market perceives as longer term trends in interest rates and what the market's going to perceive is that, yeah, we did this politicized thing, but the result of that is we're going to be like we were in the Nixon administration facing a very substantial inflationary outlook and forced to raise rates in the future. And long term rates are going to be high as a result of that understanding. So in some sense, this is all incredibly damaging to the Fed as an institution and incredibly counterproductive to the goal of lowering interest rates in the economy. And if the administration would like to see that happen, I have a very easy solution for them, something over which they have direct control, which is roll back these excessively high tariffs. We spent a lot of time talking about what could go wrong here. And I realize that there's now apparently a third mortgage application that may not help Lisa Cook's case, at least according to what we're hearing from the administration. But when we think about things that could go right as well, if this is going to be a precedent setting ruling one way or the other. And Lisa Cook keeps her job based on, say, a Supreme Court ruling, what would that mean for Fed independence going forward? I hope what it means is that we entrench in this country the sort of legal respect for the incredible importance institutionally of the Federal Reserve and the incredible importance to our country's not just economic security, but sort of place in the global world order with respect to the independence of this institution. And why it's so critical is that it's taken, you know, generations, decades to be able to be the type of country that enjoys the safe harbor premium that is allowed to borrow at lower rates precisely because we're like a stable ship in kind of turbulent waters at times. And what happens if you are no longer that? And in some sense, that sort of credibility that took decades and generations to build it can evaporate very, very quickly. And when you are no longer that, that translates into real economic costs. It translates into an environment that's not friendly for business investment. It translates to higher mortgage rates for households and for borrowers in this country. So I am hopeful that what we're going to see is we're going to see entrenched respect for something that is so pivotal to our economic strength. With all of this, said Natasha, and I'm out of time. I only have a couple of seconds. Did the Fed do the right thing by not weighing in today in court? I think that the Federal Reserve is doing exactly what it needs to and should do in this case. And as you know, they're named as a suit, as a party in this suit. So it's a complicated sort of judicial dance for it to be doing. But they're doing exactly what they should be, and they have great lawyers there, as does a legal mandate.",
