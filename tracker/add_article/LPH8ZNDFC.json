Recent government efforts have reduced crime and improved the city’s image, encouraging tourists to explore beyond the Amalfi Coast. The author’s 48‑hour trip highlighted the energetic atmosphere of local pizzerias like Sorbillo, the authenticity of AVPN‑approved ingredients, and the rich pastry culture exemplified by Sfogliatelle. Despite warnings, the experience showcased Naples as a dynamic gem worth visiting, blending culinary excellence with cultural vibrancy.",
