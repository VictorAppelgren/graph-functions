  "title": "Social Security stronger under Trump, critics pushing \u2018false\u2019 narrative, commissioner says",
  "description": "Frank Bisignano responds to concerns about Trump social security reforms, highlighting a number of operational statistics he says proves the program is doing better under Trump.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump's pick to head the nation's Social Security apparatus, Commissioner Frank Bisignano, told Fox News Digital that criticisms of the Trump administration's approach to Social Security are politically motivated and misleading.\n\nDemocrats have expressed a wide range of concerns about Social Security under the current administration, including claims the Trump administration is making it more difficult for seniors and people with disabilities to access their benefits. The Trump administration's critics have also expressed concern that the president is seeking to privatize the program and is exaggerating fraud concerns to justify sweeping reforms. Democrats in Congress have gone as far as launching a \"Social Security War Room\" to coordinate their efforts to fight back.\n\n\"I don't know what they're having a war about,\" Bisignano said. \"I personally think they're really scared that it's going to be great, and that ruins their silly little narrative.\"\n\nEXCLUSIVE: TRUMP TOUTS 'ZERO TAX' BENEFITS FOR MAJORITY OF SENIORS ON SOCIAL SECURITY\u2019S 90TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nBisignano took head-on the accusation that forced staffing cuts at the Social Security Administration will significantly impact beneficiaries and program efficiency. He argued not only that the reports of staff cuts were misleading, but also that the idea of program efficiency being correlated to the ratio of beneficiaries to staff members is a false narrative being pushed by the media and Trump's critics.\n\n\"Somebody would say, 'In 1960 we had one employee for every 480 beneficiaries, and today it's one for every 1,500. They can't have enough staff.' Well, we weren't doing 1.5 million transactions on the web then. We didn't have phone technology then, and, by the way, we delivered everybody a check, and now less than 1% of people are getting checks. So it's a completely different world.\"\n\nThursday marks the 90th anniversary of Social Security, and over the decades the program has shifted from being one that primarily processed and delivered checks to beneficiaries, but now, as Bisignano points out, the nation's social security program does a lot more than just that. As a result, social security efficiency is about more than just manpower, Bisignano points out.\n\n\"What people don't ever say is we are the largest input to retirement planning for America,\" Bisignano said. \"We are making it better every hour by enabling people to operate on the web, on the phones, through technology.\"\n\nThe commissioner pointed to a variety of operating statistics, which he said challenge the narrative from the left that Trump is crippling social security and hurting beneficiaries.\n\nSingle-digit wait times for beneficiaries seeking assistance from the administration was one major statistic Bisignano touted, saying that it was as high as nearly 30-minutes just a year ago. Meanwhile, the program is serving roughly twice as many customers per day in the current fiscal year than it did in the previous one. Part of the success has been due to the administration's embrace of artificial intelligence tools and a move towards better tech.\n\n\"Less people come into our field offices because we're delivering better phone service and better service on the web than we ever had before,\" the commissioner said, pointing out the Social Security Administration has begun conducting about 300,000 more online transactions a day than previously.\n\nBisignano also touted the program's move in eliminating 29 hours a week of scheduled website maintenance for the program's online portal that would force the site to shut down, and highlighted the backlog of disability claims that have been cleared under the new administration.\n\nAccording to the commissioner, outstanding disability claims have been reduced from around 1.2 million to around 930,00.\n\n\"That doesn't happen by doing a sh---y job,\" the commissioner insisted, adding that \"it would be the biggest rout in the history of mankind\" if he were to compare operating statistics from his first 100 days, which he called \"the best ever produced in the agency,\" to the statistics from former President Joe Biden's first 100 days.\n\n\"You got a president that's made a commitment to protect and preserve, and a commissioner fixing the foundation of [social security] that was destroyed over the past four years by sending people home, by taking out workforce management tools, and now you have a commissioner getting it back on track,\" Bisignano said. \"And by the way, the Social Security Administration, for the three years before May \u2026 has hit the lowest morale rating of any agency in government. That will change right now.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBisignano suggested that the reason for all the criticism aimed at the administration's approach to Social Security, was strategically being pushed because it is a program that every American cares about.\n\n\"When people don't really have anything to offer, they like to offer that Social Security is going to not work, because they know every American cares about Social Security,\" the commissioner surmised.",

      "text": "Donald Trump will issue a presidential proclamation Thursday honoring the 90th anniversary of the Social Security Act, which will tout his administration's achievements in improving the program, including legislative provisions that will help the vast majority of seniors pay \"zero tax\" on their social security benefits.\nThe Social Security Act was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935, during the Great Depression. The bill was aimed at creating a federal safety net to help Americans with unemployment, illness, disability, death and old-age.\nThe president's Thursday proclamation, obtained and reviewed in advance by Fox News Digital, proclaimed the Act as \"a monumental legislative achievement.\"\nSOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION PHISHING SCAM TARGETS RETIREES\n\"To this day, Social Security is rooted in a simple promise: those who gave their careers to building our Nation will always have the support, stability, and relief they deserve,\" the proclamation states. \"Thanks to my Administration\u2019s efforts, Social Security now stands stronger and more resilient than ever before.\"\nDuring Trump's second term, Democrats have slammed his approach to helping improve the program, arguing cuts to the Social Security Administration's workforce and provisions in the Republican's One Big Beautiful Bill Act will negatively impact the critical program. However, the administration is fighting back at those notions, pointing to technological improvements, lower customer service wait times, and disability claim backlogs that have been cleared.\n\"While Democrats flail and peddle lies about Social Security, President Trump is demonstrating his unbreakable commitment to protecting and strengthening this vital program for the nearly 72 million Americans who benefit from it,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston said.\n\"By massively improving the customer service experience through technological improvements, preventing illegal aliens from accessing benefits, and delivering no taxes on Social Security through the One Big Beautiful Bill \u2013 President Trump has Made Social Security Great Again.\"\nTrump's critics have suggested he is damaging the program, but according to the administration, things have drastically improved. A source in the administration told Fox News Digital that the administration completed over 3.1 million payments ahead of schedule thus far, totaling $17 billion, to eligible beneficiaries.\nAdditionally, the wait time for social security's service delivery has been dramatically reduced under Trump, with the average telephone response time reduced from 30-minutes last year, to six minutes as it stands currently. That amounts to an 80% reduction in wait times.\nTOP DEM DEMANDS ANSWERS FROM SOCIAL SECURITY, CLAIMING WAIT TIMES SPIKED DURING DOGE CUTS\nMeanwhile, the president touts in his proclamation that provisions in the Republican spending package, signed into law last month, will allow \"the vast majority of seniors who receive social security\" to pay absolutely nothing in taxes on their benefits.\n\"The largest tax break for seniors in the history of our country,\" as the president described it in his proclamation.\nTrump also expressed that his administration is actively working to root out fraud, waste and abuse in the system, including the longstanding issue of improper and fraudulent payments to deceased individuals.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"On this 90th Anniversary of the Social Security Act, we recognize the countless contributions of every American senior who has invested their time, talent, and resources into our Nation\u2019s future,\" Trump writes in his proclamation.\n\"On this momentous milestone, we recommit to strengthening our retirement system, protecting programs like Social Security and Medicare against fraud and abuse, and ensuring that every future generation of American citizens has the income security they need and earned.\""

      "text": "The Social Security Administration (SSA) just announced a major update. Starting this summer, Americans with a \"My Social Security\" account will be able to access their digital Social Security number (SSN) online. The goal is to simplify access, reduce paper card replacements and improve data protection.\nBut with convenience comes new cybersecurity concerns. Here\u2019s how the digital SSN works, why it\u2019s being introduced now and the steps you should take to protect your SSN from identity theft both online and offline.\nWhat is the digital SSN? New Social Security feature explained\nThe SSA is introducing secure digital access to your Social Security number through the \"My Social Security\" portal. If you forget your SSN, misplace your card or need to share your number for non-SSA purposes (such as job applications or financial services), you\u2019ll be able to view your number online from a mobile device.\n\"This enhancement will provide individuals\u2026a simple solution allowing them to securely view their SSN online,\" said the SSA. This update eliminates the need for mail delays or in-person visits to your local SSA office.\nTOP WAYS TO SAFEGUARD YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER\nWhy the SSA is releasing digital SSNs in 2025\nThere are a few big reasons the SSA is rolling this out now:\n- Aging physical cards: The SSA estimates there are 47 different versions of the Social Security card still in circulation. Many of them were issued before 1983 and lack basic security features, making them easier to forge or misuse.\n- Rising identity theft risks: Your SSN is one of the most sensitive identifiers tied to your name. When cards are lost, stolen or handled carelessly, it creates opportunities for identity theft, fraud and account takeovers.\n- Demand for digital access: More Americans now expect to access government services from their phones or computers. Long lines at SSA offices and delays in mail processing have made it harder for people to get help quickly. A digital SSN provides faster, safer and more convenient access to your number when you need it.\nIS YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AT RISK? SIGNS SOMEONE MIGHT BE STEALING IT\nDigital SSN launch date: When you can access it\nThe digital SSN option will be available in early summer 2025. If you already have a \"My Social Security\" account, you\u2019ll be able to access the feature once it rolls out.\nHow to access your digital Social Security number online\nYou\u2019ll need a \"My Social Security\" account to use the digital SSN features. Here\u2019s how to get started:\n1) Visit the SSA\u2019s account portal: Go to ssa.gov/myaccount and click \"Create an Account.\"\n2) Verify your identity: You\u2019ll be asked to provide your name, birthdate, SSN and address. The SSA may use a third-party identity verification service and ask questions based on your credit report.\n3) Choose a username and password: Use a strong, unique password and set up two-factor authentication with your phone number or an authenticator app. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.\n4) Log in and check your dashboard: Once the digital SSN feature launches, you\u2019ll be able to view your number securely from your account on a mobile device or computer.\nIf you're already signed up, double-check your security settings and make sure your contact information is current.\nOUTSMART HACKERS WHO ARE OUT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY\n7 ways to protect your Social Security number from identity theft\nEven with digital access making your SSN more convenient, it\u2019s still one of the most sensitive pieces of personal information you own. If your SSN falls into the wrong hands, it can lead to identity theft, credit fraud and even tax return scams. Here are the best ways to protect it:\n1) Use a strong password for your SSA account: Create a unique, complex password for your \"My Social Security\" account and enable two-factor authentication. This ensures that even if someone guesses your password, they won\u2019t be able to log in without a second verification step. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.\n2) Avoid public Wi-Fi when accessing your SSN: If you're checking your SSA account, avoid doing so over unsecured networks like public Wi-Fi. Use a secure home network or VPN to encrypt your connection and protect your session from hackers. For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.\n3) Be cautious of phishing scams and use strong antivirus software: Scammers often pose as the SSA to trick you into revealing your SSN. Don\u2019t click links in unsolicited emails or texts and never give personal information unless you\u2019re sure the source is legitimate. Always go directly to ssa.gov if in doubt.\nTo block suspicious links and attachments before they reach you, consider using strong antivirus software. The right antivirus can help detect phishing attempts and protect you from malicious downloads. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.\n4) Monitor your credit and bank accounts and use an identity theft service: Staying on top of your financial activity is one of the most effective ways to catch identity theft early. That\u2019s where identity protection services come in. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.\n5) Check your credit reports: Make it a habit to review your credit reports regularly. Look for unfamiliar accounts, unauthorized inquiries or incorrect personal information. If something seems off, contact the credit bureau right away to dispute it.\n6) Request an IRS Identity Protection PIN: Prevent fraudulent tax filings using your SSN by setting up an Identity Protection PIN with the IRS. This six-digit number adds another layer of protection during tax season.\n7) Review your Social Security earnings record: Log in to your \"My Social Security\" account regularly to review your earnings history and benefits. This helps ensure your information hasn\u2019t been altered or compromised.\nKurt\u2019s key takeaways\nStarting this summer, the SSA will let you view your Social Security number online through your \"My Social Security\" account. It\u2019s a secure, convenient update that cuts down on lost cards and office visits. To use it safely, set up strong login credentials and two-factor authentication. And since your SSN remains a top target for identity thieves, now\u2019s the time to protect it with tools like a password manager, VPN, antivirus software and identity theft monitoring.\nDo you trust digital access to your Social Security number?

      "text": "Key facts about former President Joe Biden: What to know\nJoe Biden served as the 46th president of the United States. Prior to his presidency, he served in the U.S. Senate and as vice president in former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. During his own presidency, the Biden-Harris administration prioritized issues such as climate change, Medicaid, infrastructure and LGBTQ+ initiatives.\nDuring the 2024 campaign cycle, Biden ran as the original Democratic nominee. Following his first presidential debate with Donald Trump, Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed his vice president at the time, Kamala Harris, for president. Harris lost the election, with many voters voicing concerns over immigration, border security and the economy as reasons for casting their votes for the Republican presidential candidate, President Donald Trump.\nAfter leaving office, Biden has largely kept to himself but has remained a topic of conversation in politics, mainly regarding his health, which was questioned throughout his presidency. Investigations and allegations of a cover-up regarding the truth of Biden\u2019s physical and mental well-being during his time in the White House have been brought forward.\nBiden\u2019s family has also been in the spotlight over the years, facing both tragedy and controversy. He lost his first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden, and his daughter, Naomi Biden, in a car accident in 1972. He later married Jill Biden in 1977. In 2015, his son Beau Biden died after a battle with brain cancer.\nBiden\u2019s other son, Hunter Biden, has faced personal battles with addiction over the years and has been at the center of numerous legal investigations, including over the contents of his laptop. Before leaving office, Biden pardoned Hunter for crimes he \"has committed or may have committed.\u201d"

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: The top Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee will demand Thursday that the Social Security Administration explain a spike in phone call wait times following the removal of an online tracking tool from its website.\nNew Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan wrote to SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano at agency headquarters in Baltimore with \"serious concerns regarding changes to the performance metrics that the SSA shares through its public dashboard.\"\nHassan also questioned whether DOGE-centric cuts to the federal workforce and other assets of the government played into the situation, citing Washington Post reporting on the removal and/or replacement of publicly-accessible tools and an independent analysis by minority staff on the Joint Economic Committee.\n\"Unlike the previous dashboard, the new version also lacks historical data, as well as general processing times for retirement, survivor, disability, and Medicare benefits,\" Hassan wrote in the letter obtained exclusively by Fox News Digital.\nSOCIAL SECURITY COMMISSIONER BREAKS DOWN PLAN TO SAVE AGENCY FROM INSOLVENCY\n\"These data and other metrics provide critical insight into the performance of your agency and served as guideposts for seniors and other beneficiaries navigating the benefits process,\" she wrote, adding that call and callback times, field-office casework processing times and other data are no longer easily accessible.\nHassan also questioned whether DOGE\u2019s actions had precipitated any of the changes.\n\"Removing this information may also obscure the impact of deep staffing and resource cuts \u2014 driven by the Department of Government Efficiency on SSA\u2019s ability to deliver for seniors,\" Hassan said.\n\"For these reasons, I urge you to immediately restore all previous metrics to the SSA performance dashboard.\"\nEarlier this month, DOGE won a major victory in its efficiency quest, as the Supreme Court issued an unsigned order lifting a Maryland federal court injunction on its efforts to access SSA systems \u2013 which critics argued was untoward because they contain Americans\u2019 sensitive data.\n\"[U]nder the present circumstances, SSA may proceed to afford members of the SSA DOGE Team access to the agency records in question in order for those members to do their work,\" the order read.\nFOR SALE: DOGE MOVES TO SELL OFF ALMOST HALF-BILLION IN FEDERAL REAL ESTATE\nA purported screenshot of the now-removed call-time chart shared with Fox News Digital showed a rise from about 4% to 28% hold time from February to March.\nHowever, SSA has claimed similar information cited in the Washington Post report is \"false.\"\n\"The reality for callers to our 800-number is about 42 percent handle their business through automated, self-service options. And for those who want to speak to a representative, about 75 percent use the callback-assist feature\u2014they do not wait on hold for long periods of time,\" said Stephen McGraw, an SSA spokesman.\n\"Considering the experience of our customers electing to receive a callback, our average speed of answer on the 800 number is now about 19 minutes so far this year. Moreover, the monthly trends are improving and better than the previous two years, as callers waited only about 12 minutes on the phone before speaking to a representative in May compared to 30 minutes in January.\"\nMcGraw said wait times are forecasted to improve for the rest of the year.\n\"As Commissioner Bisignano evaluates the agency, we are updating our performance metrics to reflect the real-life experiences of the people we serve and highlight the fastest ways our customers can get service.\"\n\"It is critical that the agency measures what matters most to improve customer service while providing all Americans the information they need to select the service channel that works best for them,\" McGraw concluded.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBisignano has said increased staffing is not the long-term solution to the agency\u2019s systemic woes.\nHe also appeared to endorse the DOGE idea of upgrading tech systems, saying he wants SSA to be a \"digital-first, technology-led organization that puts the public as our focal point.\"\nBisignano acknowledged SSA\u2019s last-place ranking among government agencies in employee satisfaction, prior to his taking the reins, and said he wants to improve that aspect too.\nIn her letter, Hassan also cited DOGE work eliminating 7,000 jobs at SSA \u2013 about 4,000 of which were voluntary. DOGE also has sought to upgrade and update SSA technology systems, including a coding regimen called \"COBOL\" that goes back to the 1950s.\n\"As a result, beneficiaries have faced service disruptions, error messages, and unprecedented failures in tools to schedule and manage appointments at field offices throughout the country,\" said Hassan, whose state had about 20% of its population on Social Security as of 2023.\nHassan outlined several questions for Bisignano, including a real-time report by 5PM ET on the current callback times, wait times and such for Thursday.\nShe also inquired about any adjustments or deletions to datasets as well as Social Security processing times for retirement, survivor and Medicare benefits, plus specific data for New Hampshire.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
