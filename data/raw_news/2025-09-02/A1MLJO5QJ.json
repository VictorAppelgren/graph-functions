  "title": "Goldman\u2019s Sneader on Asia Business Strategy",
  "description": "Kevin Sneader, Asia Pacific ex-Japan President at Goldman Sachs, discusses the bank\u2019s business strategy in the region and the opportunities ahead. He speaks with Avril Hong from the sidelines of the \u201cGoldman Sachs Asia Leaders Conference\u201d in Hong Kong. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "So, Kevin, let's start with China, because we're seeing in terms of the market performance is really being underpinned by liquidity, even against the backdrop of these macro risks. What are you seeing from global investor flows? Well, certainly, as you say, this is a very interesting time in terms of the rally that's taking place in Chinese equities. This is not an overnight rally. It's worth noting that it was a year ago that we saw the media conferences and the announcement of various measures. And really since then, there have been a few milestones along the way. The first milestone, of course, was in Hong Kong, where we saw the Hong Kong market really move. And now we're seeing the onshore market share rally taking place. And what we're hearing from our clients and investors is sentiment has improved. Foreign investors are showing more interest. But the positioning changes are yet to come. Most of what we're seeing is still domestically oriented. And I think it's worth remembering that a big driver of this rally remains the retail investor in China. And it's that retail investor who's got this excess savings that a lot of people are talking about, the household savings that have built up, and they're looking for other options. And the equity markets are providing some of that focus. But sentiment has improved. The first half in China saw relatively strong GDP growth. The second half is likely to be more challenging. So we should keep a careful, careful attention to the underpinnings here, the fundamentals. China still faces many challenges, but this rally in the equity markets has got some legs. What are your clients saying about what they want to see more of before that positioning comes back? Well, it really depends which clients. If from your question you're asking about the foreign investor. Clarity and consistency are the key words that come to mind, because ultimately there's still a focus on some of the headwinds, the demographic headwinds, deflation and the challenges that we're seeing from a combination of overcapacity and demand limitations. And finally, of course, the backdrop for all of this, the geopolitics remains lingers. So progress in each of these is what underpins confidence to ensure the foreign investor can return and the floors can move. We are seeing some return, though I think it's important to acknowledge that hedge fund positioning has improved, but the long or at least the longer term investor, that's going to take a lot more clarity and a lot more consistency before we see the flows move. So Goldman to know where its bar on investing in China as well as, you know, build on the business that's already here. Well, we've been in China for 40 years. We have a long history here. We are very committed to our business here and we've been maintaining the footprint through tough times and good times. This is a moment when we see certainly opportunity and we continue to look at China with a lens that says there are plenty of places where our clients need services, need the support that we can provide, and we're going to be there for them. And it's with that lens, our client lens, that we are very focused on the opportunities that we have in China. We talked about Hong Kong, China. We're seeing this IPO boom. Is Goldman looking at expansion potentially here? Well, this has been a busy time, 57 so far this year, 200 in the pipeline. There's a lot of activity building in Hong Kong. And in that context, we're hiring. We certainly are hiring. We continue to look at the opportunity to meet the needs of our clients. But we will do it in a thoughtful way, because one of the things which I'm very focused on and my colleagues are very focused on, is making sure that we're there for our clients, but we don't get ahead of ourselves. And so it's a thoughtful approach, but we certainly are heart. Are you hiring in India, where you recently opened a bigger Mumbai office? But this is also coming against the backdrop of fraught US-India relations. I mean, is that going to affect your plans, your footprint in India? Well, we again, we've been in India for a long time, and our expansion and growth in India spans many decades. But this is an important moment. We have indeed, as you said, just opened a new location. It's an expansion of what we had previously. It's a world class facility. We're very proud of it. And in that context, we did so because we do see opportunities in India. The underpinning factors in India, which essentially come down to a combination of demographics, political stability and indeed reform, which is increasing the financial focus and power of the domestic market in India. All of those come together and make us confident about the longer term opportunity. And just as I said, with China and India, we take that longer term view. We want to make sure we're there for our clients. And so we'll look beyond near-term challenges. And that's why we've made this commitment through an expanded location, the relations with the US. So do you not think that that could potentially affect the longer term trajectory of India's growth story? The short term does fall for the long term. Obviously you have to pay careful attention to it. And I think in reality, the India story has been a domestic story to tell. Large degree if just to get quarters to GDP. It came in at 7.8%. And that was largely because of a combination of consumption beginning to improve and also the services economy. So, of course, it doesn't matter what happens in terms of broader geopolitical context, the political relationship, the export, all of that matters. But the Indian story has a large domestic component to it as well. And I hope and believe that over time, these differences, as the world itself transitions to a different set of international relations, the images coming out of Beijing, talk to this. We're in a period of change. Hopefully will settle down over the course of that time. I'm pretty confident we'll find opportunities to help our clients. Talk to me about how you're looking to build the India business. What are the largest revenue generators for government in the country now? Well, in India, we have many different parts of our business that we're already proud of and continue to expand. Our investment banking business there has certainly benefited from this expansion. The ECM side of the business is starting to see the growth and we've made a conscious effort to do that. But it's not just there. We see our equities business continues to develop. So I'm very much of a view that India business will look like the rest of our business across the region over time, and there's plenty of places, therefore we will continue to expand and develop. You talked about hiring idea in rich areas, rich cities, particularly for India. What sort of headcount are you looking at? Our metro presence is in Mumbai from the point of view of the client service business, but we're also present in Hyderabad and Bangalore through our global capability centers. All of those locations will be a focus for hiring in India.",

  "summary": "Gold's Kevin Sneader discusses the ongoing rally in Chinese equities, particularly in Hong Kong, where the Hong Kong market has seen a significant rise. Despite macro risks, this rally is not an overnight, and this is expected to continue, with foreign investors showing more interest. However, he noted that most of this rally remains the retail investor in China, who is looking for other options. Despite these challenges, Goldman believes that this rally has some legs and that the future of this equity market is still uncertain. The firm has been in China for 40 years and is focused on the opportunities it has in the country. Despite this, Sneader noted that the firm is committed to maintaining its footprint through tough times and good times. He also mentioned that Goldman is hiring more in India, where it recently opened a bigger Mumbai office and is looking to expand its business there.",
