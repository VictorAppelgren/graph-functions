  "content": "Did I just father a meme coin? Well, accidentally\u2026 originally appeared on TheStreet.\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll tell you what happened.\n\nLast month, I was writing an article about Pudgy Penguins \u2014 the NFT collection turned Walmart toy success story, known across crypto circles. It was a pretty normal day.\n\nThe piece was supposed to highlight how Pudgy Penguins, against all logic, had outperformed Bitcoin that week in sheer price action.\n\nBut instead of calling it \"Pudgy Penguins\" throughout, I used the phrase \u201cWalmart toy coin.\u201d Why? Because you can literally walk into Walmart, buy a Pudgy Penguin toy, scan a QR code, and unlock an NFT. It felt accurate. It felt fun. It was just one line.\n\nThat was it \u2014 the line that started it all.\n\nApparently, calling something a Walmart toy coin is meme gold. Within hours, an X (formerly Twitter) community popped up. Someone forked a coin. They actually called it \u201cWalmart Toy Coin.\u201d\n\nAnd no \u2014 this isn\u2019t a shill. This is just a first-hand account of what happens when the crypto trenches take a throwaway joke and run with it.\n\nTo be clear: I didn't launch it. I didn't fund it. I didn\u2019t promote it. In fact, we never editorialized that phrase in follow-ups because we knew how wild things can get. But still, it happened. On that day, the newly minted \"Walmart Toy Coin\" was up 50%, data from DEXScreener showed. Market cap hit half a million dollars at its peak. As of writing this, it's back down to $38,000, as most meme coins go. But the community? Still hanging on. Memes are still flying.\n\nSo... did I just father a meme coin?\n\nThis is the kind of weird stuff only crypto can make happen. The speed, the spontaneity, the utter chaos of it all. It\u2019s funny, but also kind of telling. Anything\u2014anything\u2014can become a coin. A passing phrase. A tweet. A typo. If enough people think it\u2019s funny, or relatable, or ironic, they\u2019ll ape in. The coin isn\u2019t the product. The vibe is the product.\n\nWe\u2019re in an age where making a coin is easier than ever. With platforms like Pump.fun you can launch a Solana-based token in a few clicks. No code needed.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, of the nearly 7 million cryptocurrencies listed since 2021, 3.7 million have since stopped trading and are considered failed. It means over 50% of all cryptocurrencies have failed. But a handful spark. And when they do, they take on a life of their own. Communities form. Telegrams explode. Memes multiply. And suddenly you\u2019re staring at a microculture that didn\u2019t exist a day ago.",

But if you\u2019re looking for the real breakout star of the day, it\u2019s a penguin.\nThat\u2019s right. Pudgy Penguins\u2019 token, PENGU, is soaring past nearly everything in sight. While Bitcoin is up 5% in the past 24 hours, PENGU has rocketed nearly 28%, making it one of the day\u2019s biggest gainers among large-cap altcoins.\nSo what exactly is PENGU?\nPENGU is the memecoin tied to the popular Pudgy Penguins NFT brand. You may have seen their cutesy avatars on X or even on shelves at Walmart, where Pudgy Penguins plushies and toys have become a surprising hit. The brand is leaning hard into mainstream culture, and crypto traders are clearly buying the hype\u2014literally.\nThe token's market cap now tops $1.2 billion, putting it ahead of more established names like Fantom and Flow. With over $1 billion in 24-hour trading volume, PENGU is showing signs of momentum.\nIt\u2019s not alone, either. Other memecoins are also on fire today. FARTCOIN is up more than 16%, BONK has jumped nearly 12%, and WIF is riding an 11% gain. Even PEPE is climbing close to 10%.\nBut the penguin is the king today.\nFor context, Ethereum is up 8.3%, and Solana is tacking on around 4.4%. Not bad\u2014but PENGU is lapping them all.\n\u2018Walmart toy coin\u2019 outpaces Bitcoin even as it hits all-time high first appeared on TheStreet on Jul 10, 2025\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jul 10, 2025, where it first appeared."

  "argos_summary": "An author recounts how a single line in a TheStreet article\u2014referring to Pudgy Penguins as a \"Walmart toy coin\"\u2014sparked the creation of a meme coin that briefly outperformed Bitcoin. The newly minted token surged 50% and peaked at a half\u2011million dollar market cap before falling to $38,000, illustrating how quickly a joke can turn into a crypto phenomenon. The piece also highlights the explosive rise of Pudgy Penguins\u2019 own token, PENGU, which has eclipsed major altcoins and attracted massive trading volume. It underscores the ease of launching meme coins today and the high failure rate of cryptocurrencies, yet notes that a few can ignite vibrant communities and cultural impact.",
