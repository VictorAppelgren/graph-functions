  "description": "Former president denies involvement in alleged effort to overturn his loss in the 2022 election.",
  "content": "Former president denies involvement in alleged effort to overturn his loss in the 2022 election.\n\nLawyers have submitted a final statement on behalf of Brazilian ex-President Jair Bolsonaro in a trial focused on his alleged role in a plot to stay in power despite losing the 2022 election.\n\nIn a statement submitted on Wednesday evening, Bolsonaro\u2019s legal representatives denied the charges against him and said that prosecutors had presented no convincing evidence.\n\n\u201cThere is no way to convict Jair Bolsonaro based on the evidence presented in the case, which largely demonstrated that he ordered the transition \u2026 and assured his voters that the world would not end on December 31st,\u201d the document states.\n\nThe right-wing former president faces up to 12 years in prison if convicted of attempting to mount a coup after losing a presidential election to left-wing rival and current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\n\nBolsonaro, who raised alarm in the months leading up to the election by casting doubt on the voting process, has denied involvement in the plot, which allegedly included plans for Lula\u2019s assassination.\n\nThe former leader\u2019s legal representatives say the fact that he authorised the transition contradicts the coup allegations.\n\n\u201cThis is evidence that eliminates the most essential of the accusatory premises,\u201d they said.\n\nProsecutor-General Paulo Gonet submitted final arguments in July, citing handwritten notes, digital files, message exchanges, and spreadsheets that he said show details of a conspiracy to suppress democracy.\n\nFollowing Bolsonaro\u2019s election loss, crowds of his supporters gathered outside of military bases, calling on the armed forces to intervene and prevent Lula from taking office. A group of Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters also stormed federal buildings in the capital of Brasilia on January 8, 2023. Some drew parallels to a military coup in the 1960s that marked the beginning of a decades-long period of dictatorship, for which Bolsonaro himself has long expressed fondness.\n\nBolsonaro and his allies, including United States President Donald Trump, have depicted the trial as a politically motivated \u201cwitch hunt\u201d.\n\nA recent survey conducted by Datafolha, a Brazilian polling institute, found that more than 50 percent of Brazilians agree with the court\u2019s decision to place Bolsonaro under house arrest in August. The survey also found that a majority believe that Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, a frequent target of right-wing ire and central figure in the trial, is following the law.\n\nRespondents also largely disagreed with the claim that Bolsonaro was being persecuted for political reasons, with 39 percent in agreement and 53 percent in disagreement.\n\nSpeaking from the White House on Thursday, Trump said Bolsonaro was an \u201chonest man\u201d and the victim of an attempted \u201cpolitical execution\u201d.\n\nThe Trump administration has mounted a pressure campaign to push the court to drop Bolsonaro\u2019s case, sanctioning De Moraes and announcing severe sanctions on Brazilian exports to the US. That move has met anger in Brazil and been depicted as an attack on Brazilian sovereignty.",

Trump has since softened the blow by excluding key sectors in Brazil, such as aircraft, energy and orange juice, from the heaviest levies.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not facing the worst-case scenario,\u201d Brazilian Treasury Secretary Rogerio Ceron told reporters on Wednesday.\nResponding to the 50-percent tariff in his statement on Wednesday, President Lula criticised Washington\u2019s \u201cunjustifiable\u201d attempts to use \u201cpolitical arguments to validate the trade measures\u201d against his country.\n\u201cThe political motivation behind the measures against Brazil undermines national sovereignty and the historical relationship between the two countries,\u201d he said.\nOn July 18, Brazilian police swooped on Bolsonaro\u2019s home and political headquarters, while de Moraes ordered the former president to wear an ankle bracelet and stop using social media over allegations he courted interference in his trial from Trump.\nHours later, Washington imposed US visa restrictions on de Moraes, his family and other unnamed court officials, escalating tensions with the government of Latin America\u2019s largest economy.\nBolsonaro has denied attempting to overthrow the government, but has acknowledged taking part in meetings aimed at reversing the election\u2019s outcome."

He has recently done the same for another right-wing ally, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\u201cThe judiciary branch of power in Brazil is independent. The president of the republic has no influence whatsoever,\u201d Lula said, stating that Bolsonaro \u201cis not being judged personally\u201d, but \u201cbeing judged by the acts he tried to organise a coup d\u2019etat\u201d.\nThe US has also warned Brazil that it will be penalised with higher tariffs if it continues its work as a leading member of BRICS, a coalition of developing economies that have sought to promote alternatives to the US-backed global financial system.\nTrump has attacked the group for \u201canti-Western priorities\u201d and threatened higher tariffs for any countries involved with the bloc.\nIn Latin America, where the US has a long history of heavy-handed involvement in the domestic affairs of various nations, Trump\u2019s threats and blunt use of US economic leverage have sparked anger.\n\u201cBrazil is to take care of Brazil and take care of the Brazilian people, and to take not to take care of the interests of the others,\u201d Lula said.\n\u201cBrazil will not accept anything imposed on it. We accept negotiation and not imposition.\u201d"

The police also seized his mobile phone. Supporters of the former president soon gathered outside the residential development where he lives to show their support.\nBolsonaro\u2019s lawyers said in a statement that an appeal against the decision would be lodged, arguing that the former president had not violated any court order.\nThe house arrest order was issued by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is facing sanctions by the administration of United States President Donald Trump for overseeing the case against Bolsonaro.\nMoraes said Bolsonaro had violated precautionary measures imposed by the court restricting the former president\u2019s social media use and political messaging.\nThe prosecution accuses Bolsonaro of leading an armed criminal organisation, attempting to stage a coup and attempting a violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, aggravated damage and deterioration of listed heritage.\nA coup conviction carries a sentence of up to 12 years.\nThe former president\u2019s supporters stormed and ransacked the National Congress and other state institutions in January 2023 to reject Lula\u2019s victory. After his defeat weeks earlier, Bolsonaro had declined to publicly concede his loss.\nBolsonaro forcefully rejects the allegations against him, describing his prosecution as a witch-hunt.\nMoraes said in his decision on Monday that the former president was posting content on the social media channels of his three lawmaker sons.\nThe judge added that Bolsonaro has spread messages with \u201ca clear content of encouragement and instigation to attacks against the Supreme Court and a blatant support for foreign intervention in the Brazilian Judiciary\u201d.\nIn July, Moraes froze the assets of Bolsonaro\u2019s son, Eduardo, on suspicion that the funds are being used to lobby the Trump administration against the Brazilian government.\nEduardo lashed out against Moraes, accusing him of acting like a dictator.\n\u201cIf he thinks this will make me stop, I make it clear: I will not be intimidated, and I will not be silenced.

All mobile phones from his home will also be seized.\nThe prosecution of Bolsonaro has caused a deep diplomatic rift between Brazil and the Trump administration.\nLast month, Trump imposed 50 percent tariffs on Brazil, directly tying the tariffs to the trial of his fellow right-wing politician Bolsonaro. Then, last week, the US administration imposed sanctions against Moraes, accusing him of \u201carbitrary detentions that violate human rights\u201d.\nPresident Lula has rebuked the US sanctions as \u201cunacceptable\u201d.\n\u201cThe Brazilian government stands in solidarity with [Moraes], who is the target of sanctions motivated by the actions of Brazilian politicians who betray our country and our people in defence of their own interests,\u201d Lula said, referring to Bolsonaro.\nThe US State Department swiftly condemned the decision to place Bolsonaro under house arrest on Monday.\n\u201cJustice Moraes, now a US-sanctioned human rights abuser, continues to use Brazil\u2019s institutions to silence opposition and threaten democracy,\u201d the department\u2019s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said in a post on X.\n\u201cPutting even more restrictions on Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s ability to defend himself in public is not a public service,\u201d it added."

I never violated democracy or the constitution,\u201d Bolsonaro said on X hours before Gonet submitted his final allegations. He said the trial was a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d, echoing a term used by US President Donald Trump when he came to his South American ally\u2019s defence last week.\nThe prosecution accuses Bolsonaro of leading an armed criminal organisation, attempting to stage a coup and attempting violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, aggravated damage and deterioration of listed heritage.\nThe defence will present its case shortly.

Experts expect that to happen in the second half of the year.\nA coup conviction carries a sentence of up to 12 years. A conviction on that and other charges could bring decades behind bars.\nThe former president has repeatedly denied the allegations and asserted that he is the target of political persecution.\nTrump last week imposed a 50 percent import tax on Brazil, directly tying the tariffs to Bolsonaro\u2019s trial. The US president has described Bolsonaro as a friend.\nTrump said that Brazil \u201cis doing a terrible thing in their treatment\u201d of Bolsonaro.\nGonet formally charged Bolsonaro and 33 others in February in connection with an alleged coup days after President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office.\nThe former president\u2019s supporters stormed and ransacked the National Congress and other state institutions in January 2023 to reject Lula\u2019s victory. After his defeat weeks earlier, Bolsonaro had declined to publicly concede his loss.\nPolice have accused Bolsonaro aides of attempting to disrupt the transfer of power to spark a military coup.\nBefore the election, Bolsonaro had suggested without evidence that the vote could be marred by fraud.\nIn his filing, Gonet said Bolsonaro\u2019s actions \u201cwere not limited to a passive stance of resistance to defeat, but were a conscious effort to create an environment conducive to violence and a coup\u201d.\nHe added that \u201cthe criminal organisation documented almost all of the actions described in the indictment through recordings, handwritten notes, digital files, spreadsheets, and exchanges of electronic messages\u201d.\nThe prosecution is also seeking convictions for several close allies of Bolsonaro, including his running mate during the 2022 election, his former Defense Minister Walter Braga Netto; ex-Justice Minister Anderson Torres; and his aide-de-camp Mauro Cid.\nBrazil\u2019s Supreme Court president, Justice Luis Roberto Barroso, said the US \u201csanctions\u201d \u2014 a reference to Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 are based on \u201can inaccurate understanding\u201d of events.\n\u201cFor those who didn\u2019t live through a dictatorship or don\u2019t remember one, it\u2019s worth remembering: there was a lack of freedom, torture, forced disappearances, the closure of Congress, and the persecution of judges. In today\u2019s Brazil, no one is persecuted,\u201d Barroso said.\nOn Tuesday, Trump reiterated his opposition to the prosecution of Bolsonaro, praising the former Brazilian president as a \u201cgood man\u201d.\n\u201cHe loves the country, and he fought hard for those people, and they want to put him in jail,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cI think that\u2019s a witch hunt.\u201d\nA day earlier, senior US diplomat Darren Beattie accused the Brazilian government of \u201cattacks\u201d on Bolsonaro and freedom of expression.\n\u201cSuch attacks are a disgrace and fall well below the dignity of Brazil\u2019s democratic traditions,\u201d Beattie said in a social media post. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s statements are clear. We will be watching closely.\u201d"

      "text": "Brazil marks the anniversary of the January 8 attack on its capital\nPresident Lula attended the event to denounce the \u2018coup\u2019 against him, led by supporters of his predecessor Jair Bolsonaro.\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has marked the second anniversary of an attack on government buildings with a celebration in the plaza where the violence took place.\nOn Wednesday, Lula \u2013 who underwent surgery last month to treat bleeding in his brain \u2013 appeared in the Three Powers Plaza in the capital Brasilia to denounce the riots of January 8, 2023, which he has likened to a coup against his presidency.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 itemsBrazil\u2019s former defence minister arrested in attempted coup probe\nBrazil\u2019s Lula released from hospital after brain bleed surgery\nHe also used the occasion to project defiance in the wake of the attack, which saw thousands of protesters break into the presidential palace, Supreme Court building and Congress.\n\u201cToday is the day to say loud and clear: We\u2019re still here,\u201d Lula told his supporters.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to say that we are alive and that democracy is alive, contrary to what the January 8, 2023, coup plotters had planned.\u201d\nThe attack on January 8 came just seven days after Lula, a left-wing leader, had been inaugurated for a non-consecutive third term.\nLula was not in the presidential palace at the time, nor was Brazil\u2019s Congress in session. But the attack caused millions of dollars in damage, and dozens of law enforcement officers and protesters were injured.\nMany of the rioters had sought to spur a military uprising against Lula\u2019s presidency.\nLula\u2019s election had been narrow: He entered a run-off race against incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro in October 2022 and emerged victorious by one of the tightest margins in Brazilian history. Just over 2.1 million votes separated the two candidates.\nBut the far-right Bolsonaro had been spreading false claims well before the election that Brazil\u2019s electronic voting system was vulnerable to fraud, and he refused to publicly acknowledge defeat in the wake of the vote.\nThat spurred widespread protest, with Bolsonaro supporters blocking highways and attacking police headquarters in Brasilia. A bomb threat in the capital was even reported in the lead-up to the inauguration.\nBolsonaro left the country for Florida before Lula took power. He has since returned to the country, where he faces numerous legal cases and investigations.\nSome pertain to his role in spreading misinformation about the election, as well as his connection to the attack on January 8, 2023.\nIn June 2023, Brazil\u2019s electoral court ruled that Bolsonaro could not run for office again until 2030, as punishment for using government resources to sow distrust in the voting system.\nAnd in November 2024, federal police officially accused Bolsonaro and 36 allies of plotting to overturn the 2022 election results. Prosecutor-general Paulo Gonet has yet to decide whether to formally charge the former president.\nOther probes have looked into whether Bolsonaro embezzled jewellery from Saudi Arabia while in office, or spread misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nStill, on Wednesday, Bolsonaro asserted on social media that United States President-elect Donald Trump had invited him to Washington, DC, for his inauguration on January 20.\n\u201cMy lawyer, Dr Paulo Bueno, has already forwarded a request to Minister Alexandre de Moraes for me to get my passport back so that I can attend this honourable and important historical event,\u201d Bolsonaro wrote.\nHis passport was confiscated amid the ongoing investigations."

  "argos_summary": "Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is facing trial for allegedly attempting to overturn his 2022 election loss to current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, with prosecutors claiming he incited insurrection and led a coup plot. Bolsonaro's lawyers have denied the charges, asserting that there is insufficient evidence to convict him, and they argue that his actions to authorize a transition contradict the coup allegations. The trial has drawn international attention, particularly due to U.S. President Donald Trump's support for Bolsonaro and the subsequent sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Brazilian officials, which Brazil has condemned as interference in its judicial system.",
