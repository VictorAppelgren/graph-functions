      "feedback": "This draft nails the intuition that tariffs drive a multi‑year regime for inflation and equities, but to reach world‑class quality you should (a) codify a regime map anchored in first‑principles—treat tariffs as an invariant that shifts terms of trade, productivity, and policy reactions; define regimes (e.g., tariffs extended/paused/escalating, tariff relief, and transition to a more normalized regime) with explicit transition conditions (90‑day extensions, new frameworks, and inflation/ payroll data shifts) and spell out the causal chain to market pricing; (b) build a transparent, data‑driven transmission: tariffs raise import costs and pass through to prices with quantified shares (about 22% to consumers, 64% by US firms, 14% by foreign producers per Goldman‑Sachs framing cited in the July inflation view) and current inflation prints (CPI around 2.8% YoY, core ~3%) per 1JX308MCU, DPH5YE0TZ; (c) anchor policy dynamics with explicit numbers: the Fed funds target around 4.3% and a market that priced a September move with mixed signals after Powell’s remarks, i.e., a data‑dependent, cautious path rather than a certainty of easing (DPH5YE0TZ; AP pieces); (d) embed Ford‑specific, source‑backed fundamentals and test sensitivity to regime shifts: Ford’s Q2 adj operating margin of 4.3%, EV losses (~$1.3b in Q2) and a tariff bill of about $0.8b in Q2 imply cyclical exposure and EV transition risk that don’t justify outsized upside without a material margin rebound (22PL3Q360; S7VFTSNFO); (e) replace a single base‑case with a probabilistic, multi‑scenario framework (base, upside, downside) with clear catalysts and invalidation rules (tariff extensions, inflation surprises, labor market shifts, or a sustained policy stance change); (f) tighten the quantitative backbone: cite July inflation, 2.8% CPI, 3% core, yields around 4.3–4.4% (DPH5YE0TZ; AP pieces; S7VFTSNFO), and the Ford/auto‑sector tariff costs to calibrate profit risk; (g) reconcile conflicts by labeling each view with its source and presenting a weighted, alternative outcome rather than a one‑path forecast—this guards against overstating the immediacy of rate cuts or the durability of tariff pass‑through; (h) expand horizon thinking to include SECTION FOCUS invariants (real rate differentials, terms of trade, BoP, productivity, policy reaction functions) and articulate regimes, transition conditions, and surveillance metrics; and (i) ensure every assertion is source‑anchored (IDs like 1JX308MCU, DPH5YE0TZ, S7VFTSNFO, 22PL3Q360) and that you cover critical cross‑sources to avoid cherry‑picking.",
