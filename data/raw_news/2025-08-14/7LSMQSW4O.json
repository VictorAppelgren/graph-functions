  "description": "A New York Times essay written by former National Security Council members lamented how the military is not resisting President Donald Trump\u2019s deployment efforts.",
  "content": "Social media users accused the New York Times of being in favor of a \"military coup\" after publishing a guest essay with the headline \"We Used to Think the Military Would Stand Up to Trump. We Were Wrong.\"\n\nFormer National Security Council members Steven Simon and Jonathan Stevenson wrote the essay on Wednesday in response to President Donald Trump deploying the National Guard to Washington, D.C., in an effort to combat crime. They remarked that this and other recent orders from Trump \"registered no public objection\" from top officers and warned that \"in the context of domestic theaters,\" the military can\u2019t be politically neutral.\n\n\"Unfortunately, though we (and others) had hoped that the military would only respond to calls to action in American cities and states kicking and screaming, we no longer expect resistance from that institution,\" they wrote. \"Once, perhaps, traditionalist officers might have leaned on protocol and refused to heed a lawless order, taking inspiration from the generals \u2014 Mark Milley and James Mattis \u2014 who resisted the uprooting of established military standards in the first Trump term.\"\n\nNY TIMES REPORTER ADMITS TRUMP IS \u2018WAY MORE EFFECTIVE\u2019 IN SECOND TERM\n\nThe essay continued, \"But today, general officers no longer seem to see themselves as guardians of the constitutional order. It now seems clear to us that the military will not rescue Americans from Mr. Trump\u2019s misuse of the nation\u2019s military capabilities.\"\n\nCommentators across X accused Simon and Stevenson and the New York Times of arguing in favor of a military uprising against Trump.\n\n\"The New York Times is pro-military coup against President Trump. What a flaming pile of trash in The Times, written by former Obama NSC officials Steven Simon and Jonathan Stevenson,\" GOP commentator Steve Guest wrote.\n\nGlobal trade analyst Kenneth Rapoza wrote, \"NYT would absolutely support a military coup if the Democrats were in the white House. Spare me otherwise. They'd then berate you in how good and just it was. Their urban educated readers who went to NYU would disown you as friends and family for disagreeing, acting as the usual useful idiots they are in service of the regime.\"\n\n\"By the way, this is the very definition of a coup \u2014 and it\u2019s the exact opposite of the oath every member of the military swears to uphold,\" former Byron Donalds staff member Javon A. Price commented.\n\n\"New York Times is really saying the quiet part out loud, huh?\" EV Partners founder Robert Sterling joked.\n\nPirate Wires editor-in-chief Mike Solana wrote, \"every now and then the media screaming gets to me and I wonder... wait, should I really be worried? and then they do something wild like ask for a military coup in the pages of the new york times and I remember nope, lol, they're everything they say they hate.\"\n\n\"NYT hoping for a military coup in America,\" columnist Karol Markowicz wrote with a screenshot of the headline.\n\nTRUMP DECLARES CASE AGAINST CBS IS A 'WINNER,' HINTS AT ACTION AGAINST NEW YORK TIMES\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, a NYT spokesperson defended the piece, saying it was \"from two seasoned national security experts\" and \"thoroughly fact-checked prior to publication.\"\n\n\"New York Times Opinion regularly publishes guest essays from a wide variety of writers with deep experience in their fields, and from across the political spectrum including the Trump administration,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nSimon also defended the essay, telling Fox News Digital that no one who read it could come to the conclusion that he was in favor of a military coup.\n\n\"As for actions, military leaders should give the president their best professional advice and decide for themselves whether they should resign if their advice is disregarded,\" Simon said.\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly criticized the article, calling it \"dangerous rhetoric.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s highly concerning that the New York Times would print this dangerous rhetoric calling on our military to rise up against the duly-elected Commander in Chief, President Trump. The President was resoundingly elected to restore a focus on readiness and lethality at the DOD, and he is delivering on that promise,\" Kelly told Fox News Digital.\n\nAccording to the Wayback Machine, the article was also titled \"How the Military Became Another Instrument of Trump\u2019s Power.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe New York Times editorial board previously wrote against Trump deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles with regard to the anti-ICE demonstrations in June. They argued that sending the troops was the \"real emergency\" in Los Angeles and creating \"the very chaos it was purportedly designed to prevent.\"",

      "text": "The New York Times editorial board argued on Sunday that the \"real emergency\" with regard to the Los Angeles anti-ICE demonstrations was that President Donald Trump sent troops to quell the unrest.\nThe editorial board wrote that the National Guard was typically called in for natural disasters, civil disturbances or for support during a public health crisis, adding, \"There was no indication that was needed or wanted in Los Angeles this weekend, where local law enforcement had kept protests over federal immigration raids, for the most part, under control.\"\nTrump sent the National Guard to California over the weekend as anti-ICE riots escalated, with participants vandalizing vehicles and buildings and assaulting police officers to protest the ICE raids in LA.\nThe Times editors argued that sending the National Guard in was creating \"the very chaos it was purportedly designed to prevent.\"\nSEN. CORY BOOKER CALLS LOS ANGELES RIOTS \u2018PEACEFUL,\u2019 SLAMS TRUMP FOR DEPLOYING NATIONAL GUARD\n\"Past presidents, from both parties, have rarely deployed troops inside the United States because they worried about using the military domestically and because the legal foundations for doing so are unclear. Congress should turn its attention to such deliberations promptly. If presidents hesitate before using the military to assist in recovery after natural disasters but feel free to send in soldiers after a few cars are set on fire, the law is alarmingly vague,\" the editors wrote.\nThe FBI is searching for a suspect accused of assaulting a federal officer and damaging government property during the anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles.\nOn Saturday, the suspect allegedly threw rocks at law enforcement vehicles on Alondra Blvd. in Paramount, Calif., resulting in injury to a federal officer and damage to government vehicles.\nWhile The New York Times discouraged violence from protesters, it argued that Trump's move to send in the National Guard was not helping.\n\"Mr. Trump\u2019s order establishes neither law nor order. Rather it sends the message that the administration is interested in only overreaction and overreach. The scenes of tear gas in Los Angeles streets on Sunday underscored that point: that Mr. Trump\u2019s idea of law and order is strong-handed, disproportionate intervention that adds chaos, anxiety and risk to already tense situations,\" the editorial board wrote.\nThe Los Angeles Police Department declared an \"unlawful assembly\" Sunday night as protesters failed to disperse in the downtown area.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom also criticized Trump for deploying the National Guard, accusing him of making it worse.\n\"Let\u2019s get this straight: 1) Local law enforcement didn\u2019t need help. 2) Trump sent troops anyway \u2014 to manufacture chaos and violence. 3) Trump succeeded. 4) Now things are destabilized, and we need to send in more law enforcement just to clean up Trump\u2019s mess,\" Newsom wrote on social media.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nDuring a press conference Sunday evening, LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell called the anti-ICE riots happening in the city and violence against law enforcement \"disgusting.\""

Once, perhaps, traditionalist officers might have leaned on protocol and refused to heed a lawless order, taking inspiration from the generals \u2014 Mark Milley and James Mattis \u2014 who resisted the uprooting of established military standards in the first Trump term.\nBut today, general officers no longer seem to see themselves as guardians of the constitutional order.\nIt now seems clear to us that the military will not rescue Americans from Mr. Trump\u2019s misuse of the nation\u2019s military capabilities. Recent changes to the terms of the military\u2019s employment by the Pentagon and its members\u2019 incentives to career advancement will ultimately overcome any constitutional and moral qualms about their conduct.\nDemocratic civilian control and the apolitical professionalism of military officers have long been bulwarks against authoritarianism. This framework proved stable through the 20th century, even when tested by the Vietnam War, in significant part because American presidents and their civilian advisers could be trusted not to imperil the political integrity of the Republic.\nMr. Trump, however, has challenged this civil-military calculus. Since the military resisted his efforts to use active-duty personnel against Black Lives Matter protesters in 2020, liberals have put their faith in the military as a last line of defense against a rogue executive branch.\nRelated Content\nAdvertisement"
