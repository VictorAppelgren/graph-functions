      "feedback": "The draft has a solid instinct to anchor the near‑term auto/EV outlook to tariff policy and GM’s U.S. manufacturing push, but to reach world‑class quality you must tighten the causal chain, sharpen the horizon, and fix sourcing explicitities. First, reconstruct the causal sequence with explicit, testable triggers: 1) tariff cadence and pass‑through dynamics (25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts) and any announced timing (cite WTNT85IPR); 2) near‑term demand response, including pre‑tariff buying in Apr–May and the risk of inflation/price pass‑through, with a concrete 2–3 quarter window for the monetization of tariff costs (cite WTNT85IPR and Deutsche Bank’s view noted therein); 3) GM/U.S. capex progression and capacity signaling (the $4B U.S. investment, the 2M annual U.S. output baseline, and the 10–12B capex through 2027) and how that translates into Elevated Velocity/V‑Series‑tier EV cadence; and 4) policy/debt dynamics and “big beautiful bill” implications for pricing/policy risk and midterm messaging (cite EPJYXB7DX for the RNC/MAGA‑bill framing and debt context). Second, formalize a 3–6 month scenario map with timing windows and path‑dependence: base case should specify milestones like tariff announcements/price updates within 0–8 weeks, a measurable tariff pass‑through or avoidance signal within 2–3 quarters, and GM plant‑level utilization progress tied to published capex spend; include 1–2 explicit alt paths with quantified sensitivities (e.g., alt A: stronger tariff pass‑through and tighter demand; alt B: policy relief or faster domestic EV supply easing pricing pressure) and a clear invalidation rule (e.g., tariff policy reversal, or a sustained drop in GM EV utilization below a threshold). Third, replace generic phrasing with first‑principles grounding: articulate the elasticity of demand to new‑car prices in this tariff regime, the lag between higher input costs and vehicle price realization, and the degree to which GM’s domestic production ramp can absorb costs without eroding margins. Fourth, concretize the numbers and cite them where they drive each link in the chain: ground the base case in the WTNT85IPR figures (25% tariffs; $4B GM investment; 2M US output; $10–12B GM capex through 2027) and the near‑term demand impulse referenced by Deutsche Bank/S&P Mobility context; quantify the watch‑list signals (tariff cadence data, GM production milestones, Cadillac Elevated Velocity launch timing and pricing signals). Fifth, tighten citations to the precise IDs after relevant assertions and reconcile any tensions: e.g., the robust Apr–May demand versus later transmission of costs per WTNT85IPR; the “big beautiful bill” debt/deficit framing versus near‑term auto demand optimism per EPJYXB7DX; and the capacity‑limited offset described by S&P Mobility for GM/Ford/Stellantis. Sixth, prune non‑topical sources (barista FIRE, real‑estate/AI wealth platforms tied to consumer finance rather than auto policy) to avoid dilution of signal, and keep a clean, auto‑economy focused set anchored to WTNT85IPR and EPJYXB7DX. Finally, deliver with a tight structure: base case, 1–2 alts, risks, watch‑list signals, and a calibrated confidence level, each tethered to the cited catalysts and windows (WTNT85IPR; EPJYXB7DX).",
