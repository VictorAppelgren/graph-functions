  "title": "Business owner behind mysterious 'Remember Hiroshima' protest doll at Disneyland\u2019s Small World ride revealed",
  "description": "A mysterious protest doll with a 'Remember Hiroshima' sign appeared at Disneyland over the weekend, later revealed to be part of Ben Cohen's 'Up in Arms' campaign.",
  "content": "Baffled Disneyland visitors at the \"It's a Small World\" attraction were greeted by a protest doll holding a sign reading \"Remember Hiroshima\" over the weekend, sparking questions and speculation online as videos of the doll spread.\n\nVideos began circulating on TikTok and Reddit Monday showing a woman carrying a female doll holding a sign reading \"Remember Hiroshima\" while walking around Disneyland. Another photo online showed the doll within the \"It's a Small World\" exhibit, strategically positioned next to one of the tunnels that the boat ride traffics.\n\nSpeculation mounted as the videos spread and earned hundreds of thousands of views and social media users questioned the meaning of the political stunt, while others questioned how the doll made it through the park's tight security.\n\nBen & Jerry's co-founder Ben Cohen revealed he was behind the stunt Thursday, telling Fox News Digital in a phone interview that he's in the midst of a campaign against the U.S. government's stockpile of powerful weapons as part of his \"Up in Arms\" campaign against the Pentagon's spending budget. Cohen said that while the campaign targets current policies under the Trump administration, the matter of Pentagon spending is \"disgustingly bipartisan\" and stretches long past the current administration.\n\nCALIFORNIA BEACH \u2018RESIST!\u2019 PROTEST PUSHES \u2018KINDNESS\u2019 WHILE CALLING TO \u201886 47\u2019 IN ANTI-TRUMP MESSAGE\n\n\"The whole idea of the Small World exhibit is that it's a small world after all,\" Cohen told Fox News Digital in a phone interview. \"You got all the children from the different countries around the world being together, loving each other. And we put a doll in there that says, \u2018Remember Hiroshima.\u2019I mean, that's what was supposed to happen after the bomb in Hiroshima. We were supposed to remember what we did there and say, \u2018Never again.\u2019 And we've, we've ignored that.\"\n\nThe political protest was launched just ahead of the 80th anniversary of the 1945 Hiroshima bombings Thursday, when an atomic bomb killed more than 100,000 people in the Japanese city during World War II. Cohen specifically took issue with the ongoing war in Gaza, which he called the \"moral issue of our time,\" when speaking with Fox Digital, as well as the Pentagon's nearly $900 billion budget.\n\n\"They've turned us all into murderers, and they're taking our money, buying bombs with it, and giving it to Israel to slaughter people in Gaza,\" he said of the war that has raged since the Biden administration. \"And a whole lot of them are kids, just like that little girl that we placed in Disneyland.\"\n\nCohen said his criticisms of the U.S.' military budget and push to build stockpiles of weapons is \"disgustingly bipartisan,\" stretching back long before the Trump administration.\n\n\"Trump is the current president. He's responsible, but I can tell you that all the presidents before him were responsible as well,\" he said, referring to the U.S.' nuclear weapons program across the decades.\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR BOMB 24 TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN HIROSHIMA'S IS 'SIGNIFICANTLY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE'\n\nTrump repeatedly has championed his \"peace through strength\" vision for the U.S. military, citing that a powerful U.S. military will keep other nations from sparking wars.\n\n\"For at least two decades, political leaders from both parties have dragged our military into missions it was never meant to be,\" Trump, for example, said during his speech to the graduating class at West Point Military Academy in May. \"They sent our warriors on nation-building crusades to nations that wanted nothing to do with us, led by leaders that didn\u2019t have a clue in distant lands, while abusing our soldiers with absurd ideological experiments here and at home.\"\n\nHe added that those days are over via his peace through strength mission for the military, adding at the time, \"My preference will always be to make peace and to seek partnership, even with countries where our differences may be profound.\"\n\nA Disneyland spokesperson told Fox Digital, when asked about the protest doll, that a cast member swiftly removed the doll from the ride attraction when it was first spotted, and reminded the guest of park rules. The activist who placed the doll within the attraction left without incident, according to Disney.\n\nBen & Jerry's, which Cohen and co-founder Jerry Greenfield sold in 2000, has a long history of left-wing politics and social justice activism, including rolling out ice cream flavors such as \"Pecan Resist\" in 2018 to protest the first Trump administration, and \"Change the Whirled\" in 2021 that was crafted with former NFL player Colin Kaepernick, who was the first sports player to popularize kneeling during the national anthem back in 2016.\n\nCohen, specifically, also has not shied away from participating in public protests, including in May when he was detained after interrupting a Senate hearing focused on aid to Gaza.\n\nDISNEY'S 'IT'S A SMALL WORLD' RIDE TO GET NEW SONG LYRICS\n\nCohen said he is just beginning a four-year campaign protesting the U.S.' military budget in an effort to get the funds \"toward the things that people really want.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Americans are compassionate,\" he said. \"We don't want to kill families just like ours in other countries, we just want a good life for ourselves and our kids. People want a decent place to live that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, good schools, affordable childcare, but they say there's not enough money, and what they don't say is that they're spending it all on preparing to kill literally millions of people around the world.\"",

      "text": "The development of a nuclear bomb that would be 24 times more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II is \"significantly ahead of schedule,\" according to U.S. national security officials.\n\"The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) will complete the First Production Unit of the B61-13, a modern variant of the B61 nuclear gravity bomb, this fiscal year and significantly ahead of schedule,\" an NNSA spokesperson told Fox News.\n\"One of seven warhead modernization programs to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the U.S. nuclear stockpile, the B61-13 will provide additional options against certain harder and large-area military targets,\" the spokesperson added. \"NNSA accelerated delivery of the weapon by leveraging manufacturing processes from the related B61-12 program, whose final unit was completed in 2024, and implementing a range of technical innovations to optimize production.\"\nSUPPORTERS DEFEND TRUMP\u2019S PICK TO CONTROL AMERICA\u2019S NUCLEAR ARSENAL BEFORE SENATE GRILLING\nThe process for the newest version began in the Biden administration in 2023, and it is now going into full production seven months ahead of schedule. A Department of Defense fact sheet from 2023 said the B61-13 would \"strengthen deterrence of adversaries,\" referring to the 2022 nuclear posture review that observed U.S. adversaries like China and Russia continue to expand their nuclear forces while \"increasing reliance on nuclear weapons.\"\nThe atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima was about a 15-kiloton bomb. The DoD fact sheet released in October 2023 said the \"B61-13 will have a yield similar to the B61-7, which is higher than that of the B61- 12.\"\nCiting defense officials, the Federation of American Scientists said the B61-7 has a maximum yield of 360 kilotons, making it 24 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The B61-13, therefore, would also be 14 times more powerful than the 25-kiloton bomb dropped on Nagasaki.\nSandia National Laboratories, where the new bomb is being developed, said the B61-13 program \"used innovative program planning that resulted in projected delivery seven months earlier than expected, a more than 25% decrease in overall time to first production unit.\" Their statement cited \"a critical challenge and urgent need\" for the acceleration and said the B61-13 \"team reprioritized qualification activities, planned tests with U.S. Air Force stakeholders and jointly completed requirements with Los Alamos National Laboratory and NNSA.\"\nREPUBLICAN LAWMAKER SAYS ENERGY 'UNDERPINS EVERYTHING WE DO'\n\"Their creativity in system qualification put an aggressive set of plans in motion to meet stakeholder expectations,\" Sandia National Laboratories said.\nThe statement comes a day after President Donald Trump's nominee for NNSA administration, former Rep. Brandon Williams, faced off with senators during his confirmation hearing.\nWilliams notably testified that he would not advise the resumption of nuclear detonation tests last conducted in the United States in 1992. He said the ultimate decision would be \"above my paygrade\" but that he would not recommend tests and instead preferred to rely on \"scientific information,\" such as computer modeling done at NNSA laboratories based on data gathered from nonnuclear detonation tests.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHis response came during a line of questioning by Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., who cited how \"millions of people and acres of land were contaminated by radiation\" during nuclear detonation testing conducted in her home state during the Cold War."

      "text": "Nearly 1,000 people gathered at Main Beach in Santa Cruz, California, on Saturday for a Pride Month protest aimed squarely at President Donald Trump.\nParticipants formed a massive human banner that spelled out \"Resist!\" in rainbow colors as part of a demonstration organized by Indivisible Santa Cruz County.\nThe 220-foot-wide display, with letters reaching 70 feet high, was designed by longtime left-wing activist Brad Newsham.\nOrganizers described the event as a peaceful act of resistance and a show of solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community.\nSEATTLE MAYOR ACCUSED OF LYING AFTER BLAMING CHRISTIAN RALLY FOR PARK VIOLENCE\n\"It\u2019s very important, the more people [who] can show our neighbors, our politicians in the world, that nonviolent resistance is the way to express our dissatisfaction with the way our country\u2019s going,\" said event organizer Becca Moeller to Lookout Santa Cruz.\nBut just above the colorful banner was a very different kind of message: \"86 47,\" a phrase many interpreted as a call to \"get rid of\" the 47th President of the United States.\nIn slang, \"86\" typically means to cancel, eliminate, or even destroy. Combined with \"47,\" the number now associated with President Trump\u2019s second term, the phrase has raised alarms among critics who say it crossed a line.\nEarlier this month, former FBI Chief James Comey posted a similar message in the sand, but instead of kelp, they were shells. He has since removed the post after widespread criticism and action by law enforcement.\n\"We don\u2019t need a king. We want to go back to the way we were. We want to make America kind again,\" said protester Beth Basilius to Lookout Santa Cruz.\nWhile the event promoted \"kindness\" and inclusivity, the imagery told a more conflicted story.\n\"They claim they want to make America \u2018kind\u2019 again, but then they spell out \u201886 47\u2019 in the sand. That\u2019s not kindness \u2014 that\u2019s a coded call to eliminate someone they disagree with. It\u2019s hypocritical,\" said Mike LeLieur, chair of the Santa Cruz County Republican Party to Fox News Digital.\nLeLieur said local conservatives face growing hostility from the political left.\n\"We\u2019ve had vehicles vandalized, tires slashed, and windows broken. I was forced off the road and attacked just for having a Trump sticker. At our State of the Union watch party, we were swarmed by angry protesters. It\u2019s been nonstop hostility \u2014 and these are the same people who call themselves the \u2018Party of Peace.\u2019\"\nJust 8.5% of voters in the city of Santa Cruz are registered Republicans, according to the most recent data from the California Secretary of State.\nSupporters of the protest claimed that \"86 47\" was a symbolic rejection of Trump\u2019s agenda, not a literal threat. But critics say that argument falls flat in a political climate where coded language carries real-world consequences.\n\"In California \u2014 and especially in Santa Cruz County \u2014 the left is creating a political environment of non-acceptance and persecution,\" said Daniel Enriquez, a representative of the California Republican Assembly. \"It\u2019s consistent with the goals of socialist movements throughout history.\"\nJenny Evans, co-leader of Indivisible Santa Cruz County, defended the event.\n\"When a great number of people come out to do something like this, it just is one more thing to show that we\u2019re not all saying, \u2018Fine, fine. We\u2019ll go along with whatever you want,\u2019\" she said to Lookout Santa Cruz.\nThe event was also part of Santa Cruz\u2019s 50th Pride celebration. Participants were instructed to dress in matching rainbow colors, coordinated with fabric laid out across the beach starting at 7 a.m.\nThe protest was peaceful, but critics say calling for kindness while displaying \"86 47\" sent a message that was anything but.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIndivisible Santa Cruz County did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment."
