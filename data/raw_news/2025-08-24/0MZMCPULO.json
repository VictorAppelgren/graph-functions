  "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 Daniil Medvedev's match was delayed more than six minutes between points Sunday night, after a photographer entered the court on match point and the 2021 U.S. Open champion became enraged by the chair umpire's decision to award his opponent a first serve.\n\nThe latest Medvedev meltdown on Louis Armstrong Stadium led to a wild change in the match. The No. 13 seed was a point away from being eliminated by Benjamin Bonzi for the second straight Grand Slam tournament. Instead, he won the next two sets to force a deciding fifth early Monday.\n\nBonzi had just hit his first serve leading 5-4 in the third set after winning the first two. After he missed it, a photographer left his position before the Frenchman could hit his second.\n\nChair umpire Greg Allensworth told the photographer to get off the court, then announced that Bonzi would get another first serve because of the delay \u2014 which is common in tennis. Medvedev then approached the chair to complain about the decision.\n\n\"He wants to go home, guys. He doesn't like to be here. He gets paid by the match, not by the hour,\" Medvedev shouted into the microphones behind the chair.\n\nMedvedev kept encouraging the loud boos on Armstrong, which eventually lasted so long that he then tried to get fans to quiet down so Bonzi could serve. When Bonzi finally did, he double-faulted, and Medvedev won the game and later the set in a tiebreaker to prolong the match.\n\nIt was reminiscent of Medvedev's 2019 match on the same court, when fans booed him for his antics and he later said in his post-match interview that the crowd gave him energy. Medvedev had snatched the towel from a ballperson during the match and was given a code violation by umpire Damien Dumusois. Medvedev then threw his racket in the direction of Dumusois, barked something at him and later flashed his middle finger next to his forehead as he walked past the umpire's chair, actions that led to him being fined $9,000 for that match.\n\nMedvedev reached the final that year, then won the title two years later. But he has struggled this year in the majors and was upset by Bonzi in the first round at Wimbledon.\n\nA U.S. Tennis Association spokesman said the photographer was escorted from the court by U.S. Open security and his credential was revoked.",

      "text": "Medvedev encourages US Open fans to boo, and they respond\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Daniil Medvedev extended his arms toward the crowd, then motioned for the fans to keep raining down the boos.\nIn New York, they don\u2019t wait to be asked.\nThe crowd had been letting him have it since early in his third-round matchup with Feliciano Lopez on Friday night, and the fans who were still there after Medvedev completed the last match of the day at the U.S. Open with a 7-6 (1), 4-6, 7-6 (7), 6-4 victory let loose with whatever voices they still had.\nIn a post-match interview that seemed better suited for WrestleMania than the U.S. Open, Medvedev told fans that he\u2019d won because of their energy.\n\u201cI want all of you to know when you sleep tonight, I won because of you,\u201d Medvedev said.\nAs the jeers grew louder \u2014 and one fan was seen extending his middle finger \u2014 the No. 5 seed added: \u201cThe more you do this, the more I will win for you guys.\u201d\nMedvedev was more contrite later in a brief interview with reporters, adding that he had spoken to Lopez and said his opponent understood.\nThe trouble started in the first set, when a frustrated Medvedev snatched the towel from a ballperson and was given a code violation by umpire Damien Dumusois. Medvedev then threw his racket in the direction of Dumusois, barked something at him and later flashed his middle finger next to his forehead as he walked past the umpire\u2019s chair.\n\u201cI was in the heat of the moment. Started losing the momentum, so I mean, was tough,\u201d Medvedev said. \u201cWas tough and I don\u2019t really remember. I mean, I paid for it the whole match after, because as you saw it wasn\u2019t easy. So I\u2019m just happy to win.\u201d\nThe U.S. Tennis Association said Saturday that Medvedev was fined $5,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct for the towel snatch and toss, and $4,000 for holding his middle finger against the side of his face. He has been docked $19,000 for his actions in his three matches.\nThe Russian came into the final Grand Slam of the year as perhaps the hottest player on tour, winning the Western & Southern Open in the last of three straight tournaments in which he reached the final. He\u2019ll be favored to reach the quarterfinals, as his next match is against 118th-ranked qualifier Dominik Koepfer.\nHe was asked if he\u2019s worried about playing that match and the ones that follow at the U.S. Open with the crowd against him.\n\u201cTough question to answer,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause what I can say is that I\u2019m working on myself and hopefully I will be better next time.\u201d\n___\nFollow Brian Mahoney on Twitter at https://twitter.com/briancmahoney\n___\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
