      "feedback": "**Feedback & Action Items**\n\n1. **Canonical Handle Mapping** – The draft references “US rates,” “DXY,” etc., but never ties them to a specific canonical handle (e.g., ust10y, dxy, spx). Add explicit mappings such as:  \n   * “Fed policy → ust10y (up 0.25 bp to 5.5 % by Q4 2026)” (cite HHKTQ3JYH).  \n   * “DXY → dxy (down 2 % in 2025, then up 1 % in 2026)” (cite HHKTQ3JYH).  \n   Ensure each handle has a sign (+/-) and a magnitude range.\n\n2. **Catalyst Window & Causal Path** – No dated catalyst is provided. Insert a concrete window, e.g.:  \n   * “Fed rate hike on 2025‑10‑15 → ust10y +0.25 % → credit growth ↓ 1.5 % → Mastercard transaction volume ↓ 2 % → revenue ↓ 1 %.”  \n   Provide the same for the crypto‑payment threat: “Crypto‑payment adoption spikes in Q3 2026 → cross‑border volume ↓ 5 % → Mastercard fee income ↓ 3 %.” Cite HHKTQ3JYH for the threat.\n\n3. **Magnitude & Horizon** – Replace vague “8‑10 % growth” with a precise range and horizon: e.g., “Mastercard revenue growth 6‑8 % CAGR through 2028” (cite HHKTQ3JYH).  \n\n4. **Structure & Clarity** – Re‑frame the narrative to a macro‑level view:  \n   * **Base case**: Fed rate steady at 5.5 % → US inflation 2.0 % → credit growth 3.5 % → Mastercard revenue +6 % CAGR.  \n   * **Key risks**: (i) Fed cuts → credit surge → margin compression; (ii) Crypto surge → fee erosion; (iii) Macro slowdown → consumer spend drop.  \n   * **What to watch**: Fed policy announcements, crypto‑payment adoption metrics, regulatory filings.  \n   * **Confidence**: Moderate (structural cash‑less trend, but regulatory/tech uncertainty).\n\n5. **Citation Density** – Every substantive claim must be cited with the article ID (HHKTQ3JYH). Avoid generic statements; use the article’s specific points (e.g., “regulatory risk” and “crypto threat” are directly from HHKTQ3JYH).\n\n6. **Compliance with Pillars** – Ensure the analysis touches at least one pillar (Monetary/Fiscal regimes, Rates, FX, Credit). The current draft is too company‑centric; re‑orient it to the macro pillars and link to canonical handles accordingly.\n\nImplement these edits to meet the acceptance gate: ≥1 canonical handle with sign/magnitude, ≥1 dated catalyst, and a coherent causal chain.",
