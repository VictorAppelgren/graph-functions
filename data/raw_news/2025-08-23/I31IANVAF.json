Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways\n\nPeople are paying more for thrift store finds \u2014 and sometimes for stuff that shouldn't even be there.\n\nA Reddit user posted in r/ThriftGrift, sharing photos from a Goodwill in Chattanooga, Tennessee, that showed two pairs of worn running shoes, both priced at $13.39. One was made by Adidas, the other by New Balance. The wear and tear made the price feel even less fair.\n\nThe photos show scuffed soles, creased fabric, and flattened heels \u2014 not the condition you expect for anything over $10.\n\nOne Redditor said: \"This is every Goodwill now it seems. I used to buy all my jeans from Goodwill but lately I've been going to Ross. They're either cheaper, same price, or slightly higher prices than Goodwill but they're brand new! So sad that the days of thrift shopping are gone for me.\"\n\nThis sparked wider chatter about thrift store pricing. A Yahoo Finance report noted that Goodwill pulls in over $5 billion annually, and critics argue that pricing now mirrors retail more than the low-cost option it once was. That tension plays out in this case: shoppers paying close to retail for items that should've been marked down \u2014 or tossed.\n\nAnother user added: \"Oof, I'm organizing a rummage sale and any shoes that are not in excellent condition are getting tossed! No one wants to buy old and dirty shoes and that price is criminal!\"\n\nStill, thrifting remains a smart and sustainable choice. Some shoppers have found vintage dinnerware at major discounts. Others uncovered authentic Japanese kimonos and name-brand tableware at a fraction of the original cost. The money saved is only part of the upside \u2014 it also helps keep perfectly usable items out of landfills.\n\nAs one user put it, \"Those look like they were consigned for yard work 20 years ago.\"\n\nShoppers want honesty. If donation bins are doubling as return drop-offs for clearance items, they deserve to know. That transparency affects more than just pricing \u2014 it determines trust.\n\n\"If I worked there and I was pricing those would go in the trash,\" one user wrote.\n\nAnother added: \"I sold my practically new barely worn gym shoes for $15 and they're selling dirty old shoes for $13+?? They should be ashamed.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

      "text": "Thrifters have noticed a significant change in recent years when it comes to Goodwill prices. Instead of finding incredible bargains like $2 tops and $0.50 books, they are encountering higher prices, sometimes even surpassing the prices of new items at Walmart or Target.\nAs thrifting and sustainable shopping have gained popularity, particularly among Gen Z, with thrift hauls flooding TikTok, it begs the question: Why is Goodwill becoming more expensive, and are these rising prices justified?\nLet\u2019s delve into the items where Goodwill might cost you more than mainstream retailers, explore the reasons behind the price hike and discover tips for staying thrifty while shopping secondhand.\nGoodwill Items That Could Cost Less at Walmart and Target\nNobody heads to Goodwill intending to spend more on used items than they would on new ones at Walmart or Target. However, many recent shoppers have been taken aback by overpriced items at the thrift store, making them question whether they should stick to their local mainstream retailers.\nGoodwill has been a go-to for those seeking unique, affordable dishes. But when it comes to basic items like jars and coffee mugs, shoppers don\u2019t want to spend extra money when they could easily find them at Walmart or Target.\n\u201cThe other day I saw a freaking spaghetti sauce jar for $2.99. If you bought the actual spaghetti sauce that comes in the same jar? $1.98,\u201d said a Reddit commenter.\nWhile browsing through the funny phrases on old coffee mugs at Goodwill can be amusing, shoppers have noticed that the high prices on these items don\u2019t always align with their value.\n\u201cI can go to Goodwill and buy someone\u2019s old, scratched-up coffee cup for $2.29 or go to Ikea or the dollar store and buy a new one for $1,\u201d another a Reddit user said.\nSoap\nAlthough Goodwill can occasionally offer incredible deals, some of its pricing seems to lack thorough research.\n\u201cSo many things at my Goodwill I can get cheaper new,\u201d a Reddit user said. \u201cAnd some stuff I know they were selling for more than what it cost in the first place. They were trying to sell a normal bottle of soft soap for $3. At Walmart, it is $1.24.\u201d\nClothing\n\u201cI was in Goodwill last week. They had used men\u2019s boxer shorts for $4.99 each. Used! And Hanes, not a fancy designer,\u201d a Reddit commenter said.\nA three-pack of Hanes boxer shorts from Walmart costs only $10.98 (or $3.66 each), making Goodwill\u2019s prices miss the mark for shoppers seeking affordable clothing basics.\n\u201cI could buy threadbare Wrangler or Rustler jeans at Goodwill for $8 a pair or buy the same clothes at Walmart for maybe a few dollars more,\u201d said another Redditor.\nWhy Is Goodwill More Expensive?\nExperienced thrifters who have been loyal to Goodwill for years have noticed the recent price hikes. But what factors are contributing to the increasing costs of items at this once budget-friendly thrift store?\nWhile some Goodwill prices may seem completely unreasonable, there appears to be a general upward trend in prices across all departments.\n\u201cGoodwill\u2019s rising prices can be attributed to several factors,\u201d said Casey Jones, founder and head of marketing and finance at CJ&CO. \u201cFirstly, the cost of operations \u2014 including rent, utilities and wages \u2014 has increased over time. Secondly, the quality and brand of donated items can also influence pricing. High-end brands or items in excellent condition may be priced higher.\n\u201cLastly, the demand for thrifted items has grown, especially among environmentally conscious consumers, which can drive up prices.\u201d\nHow Shoppers Can Stay Thrifty at Thrift Stores\nDespite the increasing popularity and prices of secondhand shops, there are still ways for shoppers to find amazing deals while maintaining a thrifty mindset. Here are some tips.\nKnow the Value\nYou\u2019ll want to avoid being the person who unknowingly buys bottled soap for $3 at Goodwill when it costs only $1.24 at Walmart.\n\u201cUnderstand the retail price of items to ensure you\u2019re getting a good deal,\u201d Jones said.\nShop on Discount Days\nMaximize your savings by shopping on discount days. Visit your local Goodwill to find out which days offer markdowns on specific categories.\n\u201cMany thrift stores, including Goodwill, have discount days where certain items or categories are marked down,\u201d Jones said.\nAdditionally, Goodwill stores often provide military, veteran, student and senior discounts on specific days of the week (discounts vary by store and location).\nExplore Other Thrift Stores\n\u201cPrices can vary greatly between different thrift stores,\u201d Jones said. \u201cLocal, non-chain thrift stores often have lower prices.\u201d\nTake a look at St. Vincent De Paul, The Salvation Army, Savers and other boutiques in your area to compare prices and find a thrift store that fits your secondhand budget.\nSecondhand Alternatives to Goodwill\nIn today\u2019s digital age, thrift stores are no longer limited to brick-and-mortar establishments. Online thrift websites, where anyone can buy and sell clothing, have contributed to the rise of online thrift shopping, offering increasing competition to Goodwill.\n\u201cLocal thrift stores, consignment shops and online platforms like eBay, Poshmark and ThredUP offer a wide variety of secondhand items,\u201d Jones said. \u201cGarage sales and estate sales can also be great sources of low-cost items.\u201d"
