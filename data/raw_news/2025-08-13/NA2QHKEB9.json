  "title": "Taylor Swift Addresses Hate From 'Male Sports Fans' in New Heights Clip",
  "description": "Taylor Swift poked fun on 'New Heights' at the backlash from NFL fans toward her relationship with boyfriend Travis Kelce",
  "content": "Taylor Swift is taking aim at dads, Brads and Chads once again in a new clip from her appearance on boyfriend Travis Kelce\u2019s \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast.\n\nA preview of the Wednesday, August 13, episode featured Travis\u2019 brother and cohost, Jason Kelce, introducing Swift, 35, by listing a multitude of accomplishments, including her recent Eras Tour and the record-breaking release of her album The Tortured Poets Department.\n\n\u201cThank you for screaming for, like, 47 seconds for me. That was so nice. That was so sweet,\u201d Swift told Jason, 37, while sitting next to Travis, 35, in the sneak peek. \u201cThanks for having me on my favorite podcast.\u201d\n\nSwift went on to joke about the mixed reaction from NFL fans about her relationship, adding, \u201cAs we all know, you guys have a lot of male sports fans that listen to your podcast. And I think we all know that if there\u2019s one thing male sports fans want to see in their spaces and on their screens \u2014 it\u2019s more of me.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly two years since Swift became a regular presence at Kansas City Chiefs games \u2014 and helped introduce a new demographic of NFL viewers \u2014 after taking her romance with Travis public in September 2023. The league wasted no time playing into the heightened attention by using Swift\u2019s music for promotional clips and often showing her on screen when she attended Travis\u2019 games.\n\nWhile speaking about her relationship with Travis for the first time, Swift told TIME in December 2023, \u201cI don\u2019t know how they know what suite I\u2019m in. There\u2019s a camera, like, a half-mile away, and you don\u2019t know where it is, and you have no idea when the camera is putting you in the broadcast, so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being shown 17 times or once.\u201d\n\nShe insisted, \u201cI\u2019m just there to support Travis. I have no awareness of if I\u2019m being shown too much and pissing off a few dads, Brads and Chads.\u201d\n\nJason, for his part, previously pointed out that the coverage around Swift happened because the demand is there.\n\n\u201cThe attention\u2019s there because the audience wants to see it,\u201d Jason told ABC affiliate WCPO 9 in February 2024. \u201cI mean, if people didn\u2019t want to see it, they wouldn\u2019t be showing it. I know that. She\u2019s a world star, she\u2019s the quintessential artist right now in the world, singer-songwriter, immensely talented, unbelievable role model for young women across the globe.\u201d\n\nJason said it would be \u201cfoolish\u201d of the NFL \u201cnot to show\u201d Swift cheering for Travis considering the interest around their relationship.\n\nSwift\u2019s appearance on \u201cNew Heights\u201d has been a long time coming \u2014 and coincides with the announcement of her 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl. Fans previously caught a glimpse of Swift\u2019s sweet banter with Travis in a clip shared Monday, August 11.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s such a great color on you,\u201d Swift said in another moment from the upcoming episode, while Travis replied. \u201cYes, I know, it\u2019s the color of your eyes, sweetie, that\u2019s why we match so well.\u201d",

      "text": "Brandon Blackstock\u2019s obituary is revealing details about his private life after his divorce from Kelly Clarkson.\n\u201cAfter more than 20 years in the music business, Brandon found his way back to the mountains and the cowboy way of life he always wanted to live. He found a homestead and a love in Butte, Montana,\u201d the tribute read.\nThe message continued, \u201cBrandon, along with his beautiful and loving partner in life and business, Brittney Marie Jones, started building a life, building companies, and working tirelessly to create Headwaters Livestock Auction and what will live on as his legacy, The Valley View Rodeo in Bozeman, Montana.\u201d\nThe news comes days after Blackstock died at age 48 following a private battle with cancer.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,\u201d a family rep told Us Weekly in a statement. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\nBlackstock\u2019s cause of death was confirmed to be melanoma, a form of skin cancer, by Silver Bow County Coroner Dan Hollis. His manner of death is listed as natural causes. \u201cBrandon Blackstock passed away peacefully at his home in Butte, Montana on August 7th under hospice care surrounded by his family,\u201d Hollis said in a statement to People on Monday, August 11.\nBlackstock is survived by his four children. He shared son Seth and daughter Savannah with ex-wife Ashworth Wells, and daughter River and son Remington with ex-wife Clarkson. (Blackstock and Clarkson were married from 2013 until she filed for divorce in 2020. The pair\u2019s divorce was finalized in 2022.\nWells has since paid tribute to Blackstock in an emotional Instagram post shared on Friday, August 8.\n\u201cBrandon was full of charm, wit, and just an absolute gentleman who happened to wear cowboy boots, wrangler jeans, and a cowboy hat. He was by far, hands down, the best Daddy and Pa. He loved hard and he fought hard,\u201d she wrote.\nShe continued, \u201cThe best thing Brandon has left for his children is they know where he is. I\u2019ve heard it said, \u2018Nothing is lost when you know where it is\u2019 and Brandon is with Jesus his Savior. Savannah, Seth, and our grandchildren are the best parts of who Brandon and I are. Thank you all for your prayers and condolences. \u271d\ufe0f.\u201d\nSeth, for his part, also honored his dad alongside a series of throwback photos with Blackstock. \u201cI lost my hero yesterday, words can\u2019t describe how proud of you I am on raising me and your 3 other kids,\u201d Seth wrote via Instagram on Saturday, August 9. \u201cYou were a father, a son, a brother, and most importantly my best friend.\u201d"

      "text": "Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s former press secretary, Ailsa Anderson, has some thoughts about Prince Harry.\nAnderson worked alongside the late monarch for 12 years, which allowed her to form a close bond with her grandson Harry, 40, as well. The former royal family employee recalled the Duke of Sussex being a \u201cvery warm, engaging and kind person\u201d in the U.K. documentary Prince Harry: My Terrible Year, which aired on Saturday, August 9.\nStill, that doesn\u2019t mean Anderson doesn\u2019t have some arguably harsh words for the Duke of Sussex amid the royal family\u2019s ongoing fallout.\n\u201cStop being the victim and start being the hero of the piece, start writing your own script,\u201d Anderson said in a message to Harry. \u201cI think people are just getting a little bit tired of how Prince Harry thinks the world is against him and how awful his life is.\u201d\nShe claimed that the duke is \u201ctoo impulsive,\u201d which she alluded to being the reason behind some of his recent decisions.\nAnderson appeared to be referring to Harry\u2019s bombshell interview with the BBC from earlier this year, in which the duke publicly revealed details about his continued feud with King Charles III.\n\u201cI think trust is paramount in every walk of life, if you can\u2019t trust your family, who can you trust?\u201d Anderson also said in the documentary.\nHarry has been making headlines for the past few months as the rift between him and his father continues. After losing his appeal for government-funded security in the U.K., Harry sat down for his BBC interview and claimed that Charles, 76, \u201cwon\u2019t speak to me.\u201d (Harry and wife, Meghan Markle, lost security protection in the U.K. after they parted ways with the royal family in 2020 and moved across the pond to Montecito, California.)\nThe duke also shared his wish to reconcile with his family at the time.\n\u201cI would love reconciliation with my family. There\u2019s no point in continuing to fight anymore,\u201d Harry said, in part. \u201cLife is precious. I don\u2019t know how much longer my father has.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThere have been so many disagreements between myself and some of my family.\u201d\nHarry appeared to be referring to Charles\u2019 ongoing cancer battle. (The king was diagnosed with an undisclosed type of cancer last year.)\nThere has been talk about the father and son potentially finding a path towards some type of reconciliation. However, Harry\u2019s relationship with his brother, Prince William, is something totally different.\n\u201cI think that Harry\u2019s relationship with his brother is a different beast than his relationship with his father,\u201d royal expert Kristen Meinzer told Us Weekly exclusively earlier this month. \u201cBut perhaps if Charles warms more to Harry, William will feel compelled to follow his lead.\u201d"

      "text": "Pamela Anderson exudes beauty and grace both on screen and at her stunning home in her native country.\nThe actress prefers her quiet life on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada, to which she moved amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Her journey back to the area was decades in the making.\nAnderson grew up in Canada but relocated to Los Angeles in 1990 to pursue modeling and acting. Ultimately, following a brief stint in France, she was drawn back to Canada around 2020, where she renovated and restored her family\u2019s farm property into the haven that it is today.\n\u201cI bought this place over 30 years ago from my grandmother and she lived out her life here so she could distribute her wealth amongst her kids,\u201d Anderson told CR Fashion Book in March 2024. \u201cAnd then I was just living my wild life out there in L.A. and all over the place. I finally came back during COVID and thought, \u2018Oh, this is the time.\u2019\u201d\nAnderson\u2019s love for gardening, baking, entertaining and embracing nature has grown since moving into her whimsical home.\nKeep scrolling for Anderson\u2019s quotes on her life since moving back to Canada.\nOn Finding Comfort\n\u201cI\u2019d never been on a plane before when I left this island. You know, I left the island, and I went to Vancouver, and then I moved to L.A., and then I went around the world and South of France for a year before I moved home,\u201d Anderson said in November 2022, per The Canadian Press.\nShe continued, \u201cI was restless when I was here. And I had to learn how to be comfortable, just relaxing and enjoying and putting all my creative juices into this project, making this an art project, listening to other people\u2019s ideas.\u201d\nAnderson realized that the solution to some of her problems was simple: she \u201cjust needed some Canadian roots.\u201d\nOn Her Homecoming\nAnderson knew she would one day return home to Canada.\n\u201cI always planned on coming home to renovate this place. And it\u2019s fun,\u201d she told CR Fashion Book. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of memories \u2026 It\u2019s very much like a homecoming. I was very close with my grandfather, and his energy is all around me. He taught me how the trees spoke to him. And so, it\u2019s very mythological, very primitive.\u201d\nOn Finding Herself\nThe Baywatch alum wanted to begin a new chapter in her personal life and career, prompting her move from L.A.\n\u201cI guess a homecoming, you could say, to really kind of look at my life and remember who I was \u2014 not what other people were telling me I was \u2014 and I didn\u2019t want anything that had happened to me define me,\u201d Anderson told Women\u2019s Wear Daily in October 2024. \u201cI wanted what I do to define me \u2026 all these realizations came to me in the rose garden.\u201d\nOn Making a Big Change\nAnderson spoke about a transitional period in her life two years after her divorce from Dan Hayhurst. The pair were married from 2020 to 2022.\n\u201cA few years back, I kind of gave up at some point and needed a change,\u201d the Naked Gun actress told Better Homes & Gardens in August 2024. \u201cI thought, \u2018Well, I guess that\u2019s just what people think of me.\u2019 I was not in a good space when I moved back to Canada. I don\u2019t know what happened over the last few decades, but I feel now so far removed from the image of who I was.\u201d\nShe continued, \u201cI felt very sad and lonely. I didn\u2019t feel just misunderstood, I felt like I had really screwed up, that my whole life was a bundle of mistakes. I was hard on myself, and I thought I put my family through a lot and put my kids through so much.\u201d (Anderson shares kids Brandon and Dylan Lee with ex-husband Tommy Lee.)\n\u201cI came to a point where I decided to move home and disappear and get into my garden,\u201d she concluded. \u201cAnd when I started building the garden, it was really like a metaphor of putting my life back together. I began planting seeds, and the smallest things became really profound.\u201d\nOn Her Love for Gardening\nAnderson\u2019s green thumb is something she inherited from her family.\n\u201cIt comes from my grandfather Herman. He was really interesting and the closest person to me as a child,\u201d she told Better Homes & Gardens. \u201cHe was very much into mythology and fairy tales, and we always spoke about them when I was little. He would put little mirrors around in the garden, and he told me that was a way I could catch a glimpse of fairies and elves.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cI have a little collection of marbles and little toys that I still find in the garden. And I think, \u2018Did I put those there as a child for my future self?\u2019 Believe me, I\u2019ve gone crazy with all this. Do you realize that this place that I bought from my grandmother is the same place my parents brought me home from the hospital when I was born? There were nine cabins, and we lived in cabin six. This is the first place my feet touched the actual soil.\u201d\nOn Her Passion for Baking\nOne thing that has helped Anderson turn her house into a home is baking delicious treats.\n\u201cThis bread thing is such a meditation for me,\u201d she told Better Homes & Gardens. \u201cYou\u2019re always on the search for the best loaf and it never comes. There\u2019s something about it that I compare to giving birth. If all those other people have done it, then so can I. Baking teaches patience. I\u2019ve come to realize there\u2019s so much about cooking that is good for you. If you like to cook, you\u2019re good at lots of things.\u201d"

      "text": "Taylor Swift\nSinger-songwriter Taylor Swift, who was raised on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania, was first introduced to music by her grandmother, a professional opera singer. Swift began competing in karaoke contests at the age of 10 and learned the guitar at 12.\nAfter her family relocated to Tennessee so she could pursue music, Swift was discovered at a cafe and was offered a record deal. Her first single, \u201cTim McGraw,\u201d peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard charts and served as the lead track for her thrice Platinum-selling self-titled debut album, released in 2006.\nSwift gradually shifted her sound from country to pop and released four more albums \u2014 Fearless in 2008, Speak Now in 2010, Red in 2012 and 1989 in 2014. The enormous success of the latter three earned her a world record as the first act to have three million-selling weeks on the Billboard 200 albums chart.\nAfter a brief hiatus from the spotlight, she dropped her Reputation album in 2017. She released Lover two years later, which she followed up with two surprise albums in 2020, Folklore and Evermore. Swift released her 10th studio album, Midnights, in October 2022.\nThrough the years, Swift has won 12 Grammys and was honored in the Songwriters Hall of Fame. She was also the star of her own documentary, Miss Americana, which premiered on Netflix in 2020.\nSwift released her first rerecorded album, Fearless (Taylor\u2019s Version) in April 2021. The project began following a dispute with Scooter Braun over his purchase of the rights to her masters for more than $300 million from Big Machine Records\u2019 Scott Borchetta. She went on to release Red (Taylor\u2019s Version) and Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version) in November 2021 and July 2023, respectively. The latter helped her break the record for the most No. 1 albums by a woman. Swift officially announced 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) at her final Eras Tour concert in Los Angeles in August 2023.\nSwift has been romantically associated with many high-profile men, including Joe Jonas, Taylor Lautner, Jake Gyllenhaal, John Mayer, Harry Styles, Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston, and has often written about her relationships in her songs.\nIn 2017, Swift began dating English actor Joe Alwyn. The pair kept their relationship as private as possible, with Swift revealing in 2020 that her then-boyfriend helped her cowrite songs on both Folklore and Evermore amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Us confirmed their split in April 2023.\nSwift went on to briefly date The 1975\u2019s Matty Healy before being linked to Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce in September 2023."

      "text": "Travis Kelce has opened up about his relationship with Taylor Swift, revealing how she\u2019s been a positive force in his NFL career.\nKelce, 35, gushed about Swift, 35, during an interview on \u201cThe Stephen A. Smith Show,\u201d which aired on Wednesday, January 15.\n\u201cShe\u2019s fully encouraging me to enjoy playing this game,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cShe loves coming to Arrowhead [Stadium] and coming to the games and cheering for me, so I got all the support in the world to keep chasing these dreams.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cI think, personally, the beauty of being in a very strong relationship is that you get that support to be able to come in and focus on your craft, focus on being the best version of you.\u201d\nThe support goes both ways in their relationship. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to be at [her] concerts supporting her and being there for her, making sure she feels comfortable and supported in everything she\u2019s doing in life,\u201d Kelce gushed.\nAt another point in the interview, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end addressed speculation over when he would retire, saying his opinion on the subject \u201cchanges every single day.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll reevaluate it like I always do, and I\u2019ll probably tell myself how much I love this thing, and come back next year,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just something you have to keep in perspective, and I never want to get to the point where I\u2019m not helping this team win or I\u2019m hurting this team more than I\u2019m helping this team.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the first time Kelce has opened up about the prospect of retirement. Speaking to KMBC 9 in June 2024, the football star said he \u201ccan\u2019t put a timeframe on it.\u201d\n\u201cI know there are opportunities outside of football for me,\u201d he said. (Over the past year, Kelce has expanded his horizons beyond the sports world, even trying his hand at acting on FX\u2019s Grotesquerie.)\n\u201cI love coming to work every single day, doing this. I\u2019m going to do it until the wheels fall off and hopefully that doesn\u2019t happen anytime soon,\u201d he added.\nKelce and Swift were first linked in July 2023, when Kelce revealed on his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast that he attempted to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it at The Eras Tour in Kansas City. Though Kelce didn\u2019t get to meet Swift at the time, the pair later connected, and their relationship was made public when Swift attended a Chiefs vs. Chicago Bears game in September 2023.\nSince then, the couple have continued to support each other publicly, with Swift attending multiple Chiefs games \u2014 including the 2024 Super Bowl. Kelce, for his part, has attended several of Swift\u2019s shows and even made an appearance on stage at The Eras Tour in London last summer."

      "text": "Travis Kelce offered a new glimpse into how his connection with Taylor Swift evolved into a serious relationship.\n\u201cWhenever I\u2019m with her, it feels like we\u2019re just regular people,\u201d Kelce, 35, said in his GQ cover story, which was published on Tuesday, August 12. \u201cWhen there is not a camera on us, we\u2019re just two people that are in love.\u201d\nKelce acknowledged the endless speculation about his romance with Swift, 35, adding, \u201cIt can be perceived as something else because of how much it is talked about and how much we are tracked whenever we do go out, but I would say that it\u2019s as normal of \u2026\u201d\nWhile reflecting on the early days in their relationship, Kelce pointed out how nothing felt forced.\n\u201cIt happened very organically even though from a media standpoint it was being tracked,\u201d he noted. \u201cIt still happened very organically.\u201d\nThe Kansas City Chiefs player looked back fondly at how his crush on Swift turned into an official relationship, saying, \u201cNothing I\u2019ve ever done has been a controlled, organized process. When I say it was so organic, we fell in love just based off the people we were sitting in a room together with.\u201d\nKelce went on to explain how he and Swift have sustained their connection.\n\u201cWe are two fun-loving people who have the morals to appreciate everyone for who they are. We share all those values. It kind of just took the f*** off,\u201d he continued. \u201cNowadays, I just want to be respected and loved by the people that I\u2019m surrounded by in my work. I want to leave it better than where it was when I started. And I see her having those same values.\u201d\nAs Swifties know, Kelce initially opened up in July 2023 about trying to make a move during one of Swift\u2019s Eras Tour shows.\n\u201cWell, I was disappointed that she doesn\u2019t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,\u201d Travis told brother Jason Kelce on their \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast at the time. \u201cSo I was a little butthurt, I didn\u2019t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her. She doesn\u2019t meet anybody \u2014 or at least she didn\u2019t want to meet me, so I took it personal. But it was an unbelievable show. Kansas City showed out.\u201d\nTwo months later, Swift took fans by surprise when she showed up to support Travis at a Chiefs game.\n\u201cWe actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I\u2019m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other,\u201d Swift explained of her relationship with Travis in a November 2023 interview with TIME. \u201cBy the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.\u201d\nSwift also defended their frequent public outings as their romance continued to blossom.\n\u201cWhen you say a relationship is public, that means I\u2019m going to see him do what he loves, we\u2019re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don\u2019t care,\u201d she added at the time. \u201cThe opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you\u2019re seeing someone. And we\u2019re just proud of each other.\u201d\nAfter two years of dating, Swift and Travis recently took the next step in their relationship when the singer recorded an episode of his podcast. The highly-anticipated conversation is set to be released on Wednesday, August 13, and pegged to her upcoming new album, The Life of a Showgirl."

      "text": "Travis Kelce has converted Taylor Swift into the ultimate NFL supporter.\n\u201cI sort of made her a football fan,\u201d Kelce, 35, said in a GQ profile, published on Tuesday, August 12. \u201cShe is the most engulfed fan now. She knows what the injury reports look like. She understands what special situations are, third and short \u2014 all these things because she just naturally loves to hear about my job.\u201d\nDespite the clear differences in their careers, Kelce said that he and Swift, 35, actually have a lot in common.\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t experienced somebody in the same shoes as me, having a partner who understands the scrutiny, understands the ups and downs of being in front of millions,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat was very relatable, seeing how exhausted she would get after shows.\u201d\nKelce noted that Swift will \u201cnever\u201d compare herself to an athlete \u2014 but there\u2019s something to be said about the physical toll touring takes.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen what she goes through,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the amount of work that she puts on her body, and it\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201d\nWhile most headlines have been about Swift\u2019s preparation for the behemoth that was the Eras Tour (the singer practiced the entire set while running on the treadmill), Kelce was focused on something else during every show.\n\u201cTo go out on a stage, on a computer, essentially, for three hours,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe [Eras Tour] floor is literally \u2014 I\u2019ve seen underneath that thing. It is a football-field-sized computer.\u201d\nKelce continued, \u201cYou take that into Singapore, where it is scorching hot, and all of a sudden, you\u2019re feeling the fumes from the computer and you\u2019re feeling the fumes from the sun and you\u2019re doing a show for three hours with a lot of energy, bringing it every single song. That is arguably more exhausting than how much I put in on a Sunday, and she\u2019s doing it three, four, five days in a row.\u201d\nKelce was spotted in the crowd during various tour stops on Swift\u2019s Eras Tour, even going as far as to appear on stage with his girlfriend after \u201cI Can Do It With a Broken Heart\u201d in June 2024. (Next month will mark the two-year anniversary of Kelce and Swift taking their relationship public.)\nThe Kansas City Chiefs tight end also revealed what he\u2019s learned from Swift after watching her dominate the stage.\n\u201cPeople gravitate towards how she performs and how she makes it feel like the entire stadium is in this little room with her,\u201d he gushed. \u201cShe is so good at mesmerizing everybody and making everybody feel like it\u2019s an intimate situation. I think that alone \u2014 there is so much calm and coolness. She\u2019s beautiful. She\u2019s up there making everyone feel at ease.\u201d\nFans who are looking for more from Swift and Kelce this week are in luck as she\u2019s set to make her first appearance on his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast on Wednesday, August 13."

      "text": "The official cause of death for Kelly Clarkson\u2019s ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock, has been confirmed.\nSilver Bow County Coroner Dan Hollis told Us Weekly on Monday, August 11, that Blackstock\u2019s cause of death was melanoma, a form of skin cancer, and the manner of his death was natural causes. \u201cBrandon Blackstock passed away peacefully at his home in Butte, Montana on August 7th under hospice care surrounded by his family,\u201d Hollis said in a statement.\nBlackstock died on August 7 after privately battling cancer for three years. He was 48.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,\u201d a family rep told Us in a statement. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\nOne day earlier, Clarkson, 43, alerted fans to Blackstock\u2019s illness when she put her Las Vegas residency on pause, though she didn\u2019t reveal the nature of his condition at the time.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,\u201d she announced via Instagram on August 6. \u201cWhile I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children\u2019s father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them. I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.\u201d\nClarkson and Blackstock wed in October 2013 and went on to welcome daughter River, 11, and son Remington, 9. During their marriage, Blackstock worked as the singer\u2019s manager. Clarkson ultimately filed for divorce in June 2020 after nearly seven years. The pair finalized the proceedings in March 2022 following a messy legal battle.\nPrior to his relationship with Clarkson, Blackstock was married to Melissa Ashworth from 2001 to 2012. The exes shared daughter Savannah, 23, and son Seth, 18.\nIn January 2022, Blackstock became a first-time grandfather when Savannah gave birth to her and now-husband Quentin Lee\u2019s son, Lake. Savannah announced in July that the couple are expecting their second baby.\nOutside of his marriage to Clarkson, Brandon had another Hollywood connection via his father, Narvel Blackstock, who was Clarkson\u2019s manager earlier in her career. Narvel was previously married to Reba McEntire from 1989 to 2015, during which time she was stepmom to Brandon and his two sisters, Chassidy and Shawna. Narvel and McEntire\u2019s son, Shelby, who was born in 1990, was Brandon\u2019s half-brother."

      "text": "Brandon Blackstock\u2018s son Seth and ex-wife Melissa Ashworth Wells have spoken out about the talent manager\u2019s death.\n\u201cI lost my hero yesterday, words can\u2019t describe how proud of you I am on raising me and your 3 other kids,\u201d Seth, 18, wrote via Instagram on Saturday, August 9, alongside a series of throwback photos with his late dad. \u201cYou were a father, a son, a brother, and most importantly my best friend.\u201d\nSeth shared that while his father is no longer with him physically, his spirit will live on in other ways.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to watch me grow up from a Birds Eye view now but that\u2019s OK with me. There\u2019s no one else on this earth that I would want to be my dad because no one can be half the man you were to me,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ll see you everyday when the sun rises and falls. I can confidently say all the deer and elk took a sigh of relief when the best hunter I\u2019ve ever known laid his rifle down for the last time.\u201d\n\u201cI love you so much and can\u2019t wait to throw a line in the water with you again. Love you dad. Be good or good at it -love your son Seth,\u201d he concluded.\nBrandon welcomed Seth with Ashworth Wells in 2007. The exes, who were married from 1999 to 2012, also shared daughter Savannah, 23. Savannah, for her part, shares son Lake with husband Quentin Lee. Following his split from Ashworth Wells, Brandon moved on with Kelly Clarkson. The pair tied the knot in October 2013 and went on to welcome daughter River, 11, and son Remington, 9. Clarkson filed for divorce in 2020 after seven years of marriage.\nOne day before Seth\u2019s tribute, Ashworth Wells shared an emotional post dedicated to Brandon.\n\u201cBrandon was full of charm, wit, and just an absolute gentleman who happened to wear cowboy boots, wrangler jeans, and a cowboy hat. He was by far, hands down, the best Daddy and Pa. He loved hard and he fought hard,\u201d she wrote via Instagram on Friday, August 8. \u201cThe best thing Brandon has left for his children is they know where he is. I\u2019ve heard it said, \u2018Nothing is lost when you know where it is\u2019 and Brandon is with Jesus his Savior. Savannah, Seth, and our grandchildren are the best parts of who Brandon and I are. Thank you all for your prayers and condolences. \u271d\ufe0f.\u201d\nBrandon died on August 7 following a private battle with cancer.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away.
