      "feedback": "The draft is tightly focused on the dollar and stays within the 3‑6 month horizon. All substantive claims are tied to the source IDs (Z7O1DCHS7 for the 2 % monthly drop, Cook lawsuit, Fed‑independence narrative; XTQIQRP5K for the 0.36 % DXY rally, Bowman’s dovish tone, and CPI‑related short‑covering). No drift to unrelated topics occurs. To sharpen the analysis, add the concrete yield‑curve figure (57 bp steepening) and the current DXY level (≈97.9) to ground the magnitude claims. Tighten the prose by removing the brief mention of gold – it is ancillary to the dollar story – and replace “potential inflationary and fiscal concerns” with a specific reference to the 57 bp curve steepening. Finally, re‑phrase “key risks” as a bullet list for clarity. The revised paragraph should read:  \n\n> The U.S. dollar is projected to decline ~2 % in August, with the DXY falling from 97.9 to ~96.0, driven by heightened Fed‑rate‑cut expectations amid political pressure on Fed independence (Z7O1DCHS7). The 57 bp steepening of the 2‑yr/10‑yr curve (Z7O1DCHS7) signals inflationary pressure that supports the dollar’s weakness. A brief 0.36 % DXY rally on short‑covering ahead of the July CPI and Bowman’s dovish stance (XTQIQRP5K) is likely temporary. Base case: Trump’s influence on Fed policy persists, keeping rate‑cut expectations high and the yield curve steep, sustaining dollar weakness through year‑end. Risks: Fed policy reversal, Cook lawsuit resolution, or a stronger‑than‑expected CPI could lift the dollar. Watch signals: Fed statements, Cook lawsuit developments, July CPI release, and any shift in Trump’s tariff stance.",
