  "description": "Announced first patient dosed in the Phase 2b placebo-controlled portion of the EP-104GI RESOLVE trial with topline data expected in H2 2026Announced positive data from Phase 1b/2a RESOLVE supporting the potential of EP-104GI to improve the standard of care for patients with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (\u201cEoE\u201d)Additional data from cohorts 5\u20138 from Phase 1b/2a available in October 2025 VICTORIA, British Columbia, Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eupraxia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (\u201cEupraxia\u201d or the \u201cComp",
  "content": "On May 9, 2025, the Company hosted a virtual key opinion leader (\u201cKOL\u201d) event to discuss the Phase 1b/2a RESOLVE study of EP-104GI for treatment of EoE with Dr. Evan Dellon. To access a replay of the webcast, please click here .\n\nOn July 8, 2025, the Company announced dosing of the first patient in the Phase 2b placebo-controlled portion of EP-104GI RESOLVE trial in EoE. The Company plans to enroll a minimum of 60 patients in the Phase 2b portion of the trial in up to 25 sites globally, assessing tissue health measured by biopsy (EoEHSS and PEC scores), symptom scores (SDI and DSQ), and safety, over a twelve-month period. Topline data from the Phase 2b portion of the RESOLVE study is expected to be available in H2 2026.\n\nAs we continue to survey the treatment landscape for EoE, we are increasingly confident in the potential of EP-104GI to fundamentally transform the therapeutic management of EoE. We are off to a strong start with respect to enrollment in the Phase 2b study and we are looking forward to reporting topline results in the second half of 2026.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe expansion into the placebo-controlled, Phase 2b portion of the RESOLVE trial represents a key clinical milestone for Eupraxia, as we seek to advance EP-104GI for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis,\u201d said Dr. James A. Helliwell, Director and Chief Executive Officer of Eupraxia. \u201cRecent data updates support the potential of EP-104GI as a durable treatment option. In the most recent data update, all three patients demonstrated a sustained or improved treatment outcome after nine months of therapy. We look forward to announcing more results from the Phase 1b/2a portion of the RESOLVE trial in October.\n\nVICTORIA, British Columbia, Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eupraxia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (\u201cEupraxia\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NASDAQ:EPRX) (TSX:EPRX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging its proprietary Diffusphere\u2122 technology designed to optimize local, controlled drug delivery for applications with significant unmet need, today announced its financial results for the second quarter of 2025 and provided a business update. All dollar values are in U.S. dollars unless stated otherwise.\n\u2022 On May 5, 2025, the Company announced positive nine-month data from the open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1b/2a RESOLVE trial, which demonstrated sustained positive treatment outcomes in patients with EoE after nine months of receiving EP-104GI, with no serious adverse events reported.\n\n\n\nThe Company incurred a net loss of $8.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2025, versus a net loss of $6.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in net loss was primarily due to an increase in research and development costs, an increase in general and administrative costs, and an increase in other expenses.\n\nThe Company had cash of $19.8 million as of June 30, 2025, down from $33.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024. These funds are being used to fund clinical trials in EP-104 and the remainder of the funds will be used for general and administrative expenses, working capital needs and other general corporate purposes.\n\nThe Company anticipates that existing cash reserves, and anticipated proceeds from the future exercise of in-the-money warrants, will be sufficient to fund the Company into the third quarter of 2026.\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company had 35,959,568 common shares issued and 8,905,638 preferred shares outstanding.\n\nManagement continues to monitor the North American trade situation stemming from the February 2025 announcement by the U.S. government of proposed tariffs on selected imported Canadian goods, and the subsequent Canadian announcement of planned retaliatory tariffs on selected imported U.S. goods.\n\nEupraxia manufactures its clinical supplies of EP-104IAR and EP-104GI in the U.S. by a third party. The Company expects to continue to access manufactured products from the U.S.\n\nThe Company maintains U.S. dollar balances to pay U.S. dollar expenses and to minimize the impact of short-term fluctuations in exchange rates.\n\nManagement continues to assess the potential direct and indirect impacts of tariffs, counter-tariffs and other trade protection measures on Eupraxia's business and will take those steps it deems necessary to attempt to mitigate any impact as the situation evolves.\n\nThe Company\u2019s management team is scheduled to present and participate at the following upcoming investor conferences:\n\nPlease see the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related MD&A for more details. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, and related MD&A have been reviewed and approved by Eupraxia's Audit Committee and Board of Directors. For a more detailed explanation and analysis, please refer to the MD&A that has been filed under the Company's profile on EDGAR at www.sec.gov and on SEDAR+ at sedarplus.ca and which is also available on the Company's website at www.eupraxiapharma.com.\n\nEupraxia is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of locally delivered, extended-release products that have the potential to address therapeutic areas with high unmet medical need. Diffusphere\u2122, a proprietary, polymer-based micro-sphere technology, is designed to facilitate targeted drug delivery of both existing and novel drugs. The technology is designed to support extended duration of effect and delivery of drugs in a hyper-localized fashion, targeting only the tissues that physicians are wanting to treat. We believe the potential for fewer adverse events may be achieved through the precision targeting and the stable and flat delivery of the active ingredient when using the Diffusphere\u2122 technology, versus the peaks and troughs seen with more traditional drug delivery methods. The precision of Eupraxia's Diffusphere\u2122 technology platform has the potential to augment and transform existing FDA-approved drugs to improve their safety, tolerability, efficacy and duration of effect. The potential uses in therapeutic areas may go beyond pain and inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, where Eupraxia currently is developing advanced treatments, to also be applicable in oncology, infectious disease and other critical disease areas.\n\nEupraxia's EP-104GI is currently in a Phase 1b/2 trial, the RESOLVE trial, for the treatment of EoE. EP-104GI is administered as an injection into the esophageal wall, providing local delivery of drug. This is a unique treatment approach for EoE. Eupraxia also recently completed a Phase 2b clinical trial (SPRINGBOARD) of EP-104IAR for the treatment of pain due to knee osteoarthritis. The trial met its primary endpoint and three of the four secondary endpoints. In addition, Eupraxia is developing a pipeline of later and earlier-stage long-acting formulations. Potential pipeline indications include candidates for other inflammatory joint indications and oncology, each designed to improve on the activity and tolerability of currently approved drugs.
