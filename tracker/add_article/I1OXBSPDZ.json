      "summary": "The federal court hearing over President Trump's attempt to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook concluded without a ruling on her status, leaving the question of Fed independence unresolved. Analysts warned that a politically driven Fed could trigger higher inflation and long‑term rates, eroding the U.S. safe‑harbor premium. The case underscores the importance of judicial safeguards that limit executive power over the central bank. If Cook remains, it could reinforce the Fed’s independence; if removed, it may set a precedent for politicized monetary policy.",
