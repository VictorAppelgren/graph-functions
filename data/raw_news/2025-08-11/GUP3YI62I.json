  "content": "The hackers who attacked St. Paul\u2019s city computer system about two weeks ago dumped their stolen data online Monday after the city refused to pay an unspecified ransom.\n\nOn Monday, the city said the hacking group \u2013 identified as Interlock \u2013 made off with 43 gigabytes of the city\u2019s 153 terabytes of data.\n\nOfficials said they think the value of what was stolen was limited.\n\n\u201cInstead of trying to go and sell the data they had, they released it for free,\u201d Mayor Melvin Carter said, on Monday during a news conference.\n\nNevertheless, Carter said he has directed staff to offer a year of free credit monitoring and identify theft insurance to all city of St. Paul employees.\n\nThe cyberattack was detected on July 25 and led to the shutdown and disruptions of internet service at city libraries and recreation centers as well as online payment systems that handle water and sewer bills no longer working. The city is resetting passwords for all 3,500 St. Paul government employees.\n\nCarter described the hacking group as a sophisticated criminal organization that steals data from corporations, hospitals and city governments with the intention of selling it.\n\nThree days before the attack on St. Paul, the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency posted an advisory warning for business and institutions to protect from Interlock ransomware.",

      "text": "A state of emergency continued Wednesday in St. Paul after officials shut down the city\u2019s digital infrastructure and worked to the stop the spread of a cyberattack that began Friday.\nComputers at city libraries and rec centers were not connected to the internet, and there was no Wi-Fi at City Hall. Online payment systems that handle water and sewer bills also weren\u2019t functional. St. Paul\u2019s 911 and other emergency response systems were still working, Mayor Melvin Carter said, but many other city systems remained shut down in an attempt to contain the attack.\nCity workers were told that they will receive a paycheck during the next pay period on Aug. 8, a city spokeswoman said.\nIt is not yet clear why St. Paul was targeted, officials said, or what data might be at risk.\nCarter declared a state of emergency that allows the city\u2019s departments of Emergency Management and Office of Technology and Communications to mobilize support from local, state and federal officials.\n\u201cThis was a deliberate, coordinated digital attack, carried out by a sophisticated external actor, intentionally and criminally targeting our city\u2019s information infrastructure,\u201d Carter said Tuesday.\nThe mayor said he would not speculate about the motive. He added that he was not aware of any ransom request but said the FBI, not St. Paul, is leading the investigation.\nSt. Paul is also working with the state and two private cybersecurity firms to investigate and to contain the damage."
