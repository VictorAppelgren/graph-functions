  "title": "Creators Just Became TV: How Samsung TV Plus & Tubi Are Selling Scale",
  "description": "Superstar creators including MrBeast, Michelle Khare & Dhar Mann are now on CTV. Samsung TV Plus and Tubi are turning creator shows into TV buys with loyal fans at scale.",
  "content": "YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram have long defined the creator economy. They\u2019re still the backbone of distribution, but a shift is underway: the biggest creators are moving into connected TV (CTV).\n\nFrom Social Feeds to TV Screens: Why Creators Are Moving Into CTV\n\nFor marketers, this is a window of opportunity. Even a creator with 20 million followers depends on algorithms to surface content. In CTV, the top creators appear in channels, a curated environment that looks and feels like television. That makes it easier for audiences to find them and brands to buy in.\n\nCreator shows are beginning to scale like TV programming with sponsorships, integrations, and media packages available, but now with loyal, intentional audiences built in. For forward-thinking marketers, moving early means shaping the playbook while the market still takes form.\n\nSamsung TV Plus: Michelle Khare and Dhar Mann Lead the Charge in FAST TV\n\nAt the IAB NewFronts in June 2025, Samsung TV Plus announced that creators will be a core part of its programming strategy including signing Dhar Mann Studios to produce their first creator original, a 13-episode scripted series.\n\nSarah Nelson, Head of Business Development & Strategic Partnerships for Samsung TV Plus, said the company aims to put creators on equal footing with traditional entertainment. \u201cWe\u2019re creating a space where creators can have dedicated channels alongside traditional TV, which feels like a leap forward in how their content is valued.\u201d She described creators as \u201cthe next generation studios,\u201d producing premium-level content with audiences that are already deeply engaged.\n\nNelson noted, \"For 88 million monthly active users, Samsung TV Plus is their default live TV experience and often the only way cord-cutters access this content.\u201dNelson added, \u201cThere\u2019s a misnomer that FAST is for older viewers. Compared to the broader population, we over-index millennials, Gen Z, and Gen X. We have a very strong 18-to-49 audience.\u201d\n\nThe new slate features Michelle Khare, Mark Rober, Smosh, The Try Guys, The Sorry Girls, and Donut Media, joining existing Samsung TV Plus creator partners such as Mythical (Rhett & Link), MrBeast, and Hot Ones.\n\nOne of the flagship examples is Michelle Khare\u2019s Emmy-balloted long-form series Challenge Accepted. The show blends cinematic storytelling with high-stakes challenges. Her next project, I Tried Tom Cruise\u2019s Deadliest Stunt, is the series\u2019s most significant project. Khare explained, \u201cWe\u2019ve always aimed for our show to be viewed by families in the living room. Our largest viewership device on YouTube is television, so we\u2019re looking forward to making our way into even more living rooms on Samsung TV Plus.\u201d\n\nNelson also highlighted Samsung\u2019s ability to offer brands more than just media placements. \u201cWe control the platform, the service, and the channels. That means we can offer brands everything from integrations within the content to prerolls, shoppable elements, and sponsorships at the platform level.\u201d\n\nSocial platforms typically monetize by selling media adjacent to creator content, which makes scaled integrations difficult. Samsung is charting a different course, building opportunities for brands to integrate directly with creators inside programming\n\nFox-owned AVOD platform, Tubi, is also moving quickly. Its \u201cTubi for Creators\u201d program launched in June 2025 with six YouTube creators and 500 episodes. Just months later, it has grown to more than 50 creators and 5,000 episodes, with creators including MrBeast, Alan\u2019s Universe, Jomboy Media, CelinaSpookyBoo, and Steven He.\n\nAdditionally, Tubi also announced the appointment of former Global Head of Creator Marketing for TikTok, Kudzi Chikumbu, as the company's new VP of Creator Partnerships\n\nRich Bloom, GM of Creator Programs and EVP of Business Development at Tubi, emphasized the platform\u2019s scale and reach: \u201cTubi now has over 100 million monthly users streaming a billion hours a month, with more than a third aged 18\u201334 and nearly half multicultural.\u201d\n\nHe explained why that matters: \u201cWhat makes us unique is our young, multicultural audience \u2014 a hard-to-reach group that is incredibly appealing to both creators and advertisers.\u201d More than half of Tubi\u2019s viewers are Gen Z or Millennials, and 65 percent are cord-cutters or cord-nevers, making them especially valuable to marketers struggling to reach these demographics through traditional channels.\n\nBloom framed the strategy: \u201cOur audience has been clear. They want more original IP and stories, and the number one source they point to for that is creators\n\nAudiences validated that demand with Sidelined: The QB and Me, a teen drama starring TikTok\u2019s Noah Beck that became Tubi\u2019s most successful original. Tubi Studios has since invited nearly 2,000 creators to pitch. Fans voted projects into production, and Tubi greenlit four as originals \u2014 \u201cevidence that audiences want more independent voices,\u201d Bloom said.\n\nFor advertisers, the appeal is clear. \u201cTubi is a brand-safe, TV-first environment where creator content is curated, not infinite. That makes it easier for advertisers to sponsor, integrate, and confidently reach engaged audiences,\u201d Bloom said. The first example is PepsiCo\u2019s Starry, which will appear in a creator-driven diner series, kicking off what Bloom calls \u201cmany more opportunities like this.\u201d\n\nWhy Marketers Can\u2019t Ignore the Creator Economy on CTV\n\nSean Atkins, president of Dhar Mann Studios and former president of MTV, is bullish on what comes next. He sees the rise of creators in CTV as more than a distribution shift; Atkins believes it\u2019s a fundamental change in how marketers can approach working with creators.\n\n\u201cMarketers always say they want direct access to talent, premium environments, and long-term relationships where they can pivot on creative,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the way the system works today, by the time the opportunity reaches a creator, it\u2019s often reduced to, \u2018Will you hold my product for $10k?\u2019\n\nCTV changes that by curating a smaller slate of proven creators on brand-safe platforms. Instead of a one-off product placement, marketers can scale partnerships in ways closer to television deals than influencer posts.\u201d\n\nHe argued that FAST and AVOD platforms solve the problem of scale and fragmentation. \u201cInstead of millions of creators to sort through, you get a curated list of talent on TV platforms that marketers already understand how to buy. That makes it much easier to plug into creators in a way that feels familiar.\u201d\n\nThe bigger opportunity, he stressed, comes from trust. \u201cWe ran a survey and found that if Dhar endorsed a product, the trust was 80 percent. If the same message came from a brand, even a marquee brand, it topped at 5 percent. That\u2019s the value of creator partnerships.\u201d\n\nAtkins believes marketers shouldn\u2019t wait for precedent. \u201cIf you\u2019re a smart CMO, you don\u2019t wait for case studies. You commit now to combining your media dollars with a real allocation to creator integrations across platforms. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll find the arbitrage and the upside.\u201d\n\nWorking with creators in CTV also means extending their reach everywhere. \u201cCreators don\u2019t just bring content, they bring an already engaged audience. That\u2019s something marketers can\u2019t manufacture with traditional media buys.\u201d\n\nHe urged brands to think beyond one screen. A car company, for example, could partner with Dhar so the integration spans the CTV show, YouTube behind-the-scenes clips, TikTok highlights, and Instagram storytelling, with the car as a constant presence.\n\nAnd his closing advice was blunt. \u201cIf you\u2019re waiting for someone else to create the playbook, you\u2019ll miss the first wave of opportunity.\u201d",

      "text": "12 passes left to attend the Digiday Publishing Summit\nCTV looks to invest in creator content to win over more ad dollars\nIn 2025, CTV channel operators are widening their portfolios of creator content in a bid to capture more ad dollars.\nCTV companies such as Tubi, Samsung TV Plus and Netflix are leaning into creators, with all three expanding their creator offerings or announcing the production of original creator content in recent months as brands continue to raise their spending on the channel and on creators. By 2027, U.S. brands are projected to spend $13.7 billion annually on influencer marketing, according to eMarketer.\nOn August 14, Tubi became the latest CTV company to announce the expansion of its creator business, adding thousands of videos to its creator portfolio and hiring Kudzi Chikumbu, TikTok\u2019s former global head of creator marketing, as a vp of creator partnerships.\n\u201cIn the last two months, we\u2019re seeing a steady increase in consumption of creator content, and we\u2019re seeing great engagement with the content,\u201d said Tubi general manager of creator programs and evp of business development Rich Bloom, who declined to provide exact figures, but noted that Tubi\u2019s creator program had expanded \u201c10X\u201d since launching in June, going from six creators and 500 videos to roughly 60 creators and 5,000 videos. \u201cA meaningful percentage of our overall viewers have watched at least one piece of creator content.\u201d\nTubi is far from the only CTV operator to invest in creators in 2025. Much of this activity is taking place on FAST channels \u2014 free, ad-supported television channels featuring creators\u2019 videos.\nOn July 28, for example, Samsung TV Plus announced its largest-ever slate of creator-led FAST channels, expanding its creator category from two channels to 10. Between the first and second quarters of 2025, viewership of the creator-powered CTV channel Creator Television skyrocketed, with the channel experiencing a 95 percent increase in total minutes viewed and a 111 percent increase in total user sessions, according to Creator TV co-founder and head of content Charlie Ibarra, who said his company\u2019s advertising revenue was experiencing a corresponding rise but did not share specific numbers.\nCTV platforms have been testing creator-style content for years \u2014 from Pluto TV\u2019s \u201cPeople are Awesome\u201d channel to Roku\u2019s Originals and influencer-driven FAST offerings on Amazon Freevee, now rebranded to Free To Watch. Now, what felt exploratory is turning strategic, as streaming services push for more creator-backed content to differentiate themselves.\n\u201cIn our conversations with advertisers, they\u2019re hungry for these types of opportunities \u2014 they\u2019re hungry to figure out how to reach audiences in a new, organic and interesting way,\u201d said Samsung TV Plus vp of content and programming Takashi Nakano. \u201cThis is really the next evolution of what we think of as the content space.\u201d\nValue for advertisers\nAsked what sets Samsung TV Plus\u2019s creator channels apart from platforms like YouTube, Nakano framed Samsung\u2019s content selection process as \u201cmeticulous\u201d and as a way for advertisers to be near higher-quality creator content compared to YouTube\u2019s feed. Other CTV operators, from Tubi to Vevo, echoed the sentiment that creator-led CTV channels offer advertisers access to creators\u2019 highly engaged fandoms through the \u201cpremium\u201d television screen.\n\u201cThe lean-back, CTV experience is definitely a premium one, and usually the way we see co-viewing happening,\u201d said Vevo vp of U.S. sales Melissa Sofo.\nAdvertisers\u2019 appetite for CTV is growing. After all, content creators have become an increasing focus for marketers, with brands such as Unilever indicating plans to spend half of their budgets on social channels by the end of 2025.\nDentsu Creative U.K. CEO Jessica Tamsedge told Digiday that she was \u201cseeing real momentum in this area,\u201d framing brands\u2019 growing spending on CTV creator channels as an extension of their longstanding interest in creator content that shows up in ad-supported spaces. Tamsedge did not share specific numbers with regard to Dentsu Creative UK clients\u2019 spending on CTV creators.\n\u201cWhen you put those two forces together, the cultural pull of creators and the lean-in, high-attention environment of CTV, you get what we call a \u2018double attention hit,\u2019 which is unsurprisingly compelling for brands,\u201d Tamsedge said.\nAlthough brands are increasingly interested in creator-led CTV content, this mounting interest is driven more by practical economics and measurement needs, rather than an urgent desire to show up alongside creators, according to Ogilvy executive director of connections and media Mack Leahy.\n\u201cMost brands are treating repurposed YouTube content on smart TV channels as discount premium video where they can check the \u2018we\u2019re working with creators\u2019 box while accessing inventory that costs 30 to 40 percent less than comparable premium CTV placements,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cThe creator element is almost incidental \u2014 they\u2019d probably buy the same inventory if it was generic lifestyle content if the price was right and the environment was brand safe.\u201d\nOriginal content on the horizon\nFor now, the overwhelming majority of CTV creator channels simply repurpose content that is also available on other platforms such as YouTube. FAST channel operators using pre-existing creator content as their inventory need to convince advertisers of the value of showing up alongside creators on connected TVs, rather than the already-popular social platforms that have long been part of brands\u2019 marketing mixes.\nMore original creator content will soon be available on CTV. Alongside the expansion of its creator FAST channels, Samsung also announced the production of a 13-episode original series in collaboration with YouTuber Dhar Mann, which will stream exclusively on the creator\u2019s Samsung TV Plus channel. On August 18, Netflix announced the production of an original series with YouTuber Mark Rober, which is slated to air in 2026.\nSamsung and Netflix\u2019s announcements are only the beginning. Dentsu US and UK are \u201cinvesting in creators to develop and co-create content designed specifically for CTV and other non-social channels,\u201d per Tamsedge. As for Tubi, the company plans to fund the production of original creator content for its channels by \u201clater this year,\u201d according to Bloom, who said that this would be a key responsibility for Chikumbu, Tubi\u2019s new creator vp.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited that he got the job; I think it was a really good move for them, based on Kudzi\u2019s years of experience and being part of the monumental growth of TikTok and short-form,\u201d said Victoria Bachan, president of the Whalar Group creator management firm Sixteenth, who said that she had worked with Chikumbu since his days at TikTok predecessor Musical.ly. \u201cHe\u2019s going to play a very important role at Tubi: To see how they can open up creators\u2019 audiences to new people in a way that can be watched on an Apple TV or on a Roku.\u201d\nMore in Media\nAmazon quietly blocks AI bots from Meta, Google, Huawei and more\nThe change was first spotted by Juozas Kaziuk\u0117nas, an independent analyst, who noted that the updated code underlying Amazon\u2019s sprawling website.\nWTF is AI \u2018grounding\u2019 licensing, and why do publishers say it matters over training deals?\nRather than the initial training deals that formed the backbone of AI licensing partnerships between AI platforms and news publishers, recent deals have been forged around different parameters: what many in the industry refer to as \u201cAI grounding.\u201d\nInside Best Buy\u2019s new third-party marketplace\nIt broadens Best Buy\u2019s lineup of technology products, adding custom controllers, gaming chairs and desks, keyboards and mice, monitors and headsets."

      "text": "Short-form video has transformed from internet novelty to cultural cornerstone. What started as 15-second clips now looks more like a new form of television, one driven by creators, structured in episodes and optimized for phones, not prime time. The result? A boom in what some are calling \u201cSocial TV.\u201d And at the center of that boom is Portal A, a creative studio betting big on it with their latest initiative: Moonshots.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this trend we\u2019ve seen explode: short-form episodic series that are basically social TV,\u201d said Zach Blume, co-founder and managing partner at Portal A. \u201cIt\u2019s not just sketches or vlogs anymore. These are creator-driven shows with format, with consistency, with voice. It\u2019s new television, made for your phone.\u201d\nPremium short-form just needed the right platform\nA few years ago, the collapse of Quibi and the quiet exit of YouTube and Snap Originals led many to declare that \u201cpremium short-form\u201d was a dead-end. But the reality is, audiences didn\u2019t reject the idea of high-quality short-form, they rejected platforms trying to impose Hollywood models on social-native ecosystems. Now, audiences are flocking to creator-led formats built for these platforms.\nFrom Web Series to Moonshots\nPortal A didn\u2019t start in branded content. It began with a group of friends making original internet series like White Collar Brawler in the early YouTube days. \u201cWe were doing web series before that was even a term,\u201d said Blume. \u201cIt was fun, experimental, and honestly, it was creative R&D. That\u2019s what Moonshots is about, bringing that spirit back.\u201d\nMoonshots is a self-funded initiative through which Portal A invests in independent creators and bold IP ideas. It\u2019s a commitment to originality in a landscape often shaped by briefs and brand approvals.\n\u201cWith branded work, there\u2019s a brief, you see ball, hit ball,\u201d Blume explained. \u201cMoonshots is about asking: What\u2019s the big idea you can\u2019t do alone? What\u2019s the show you wish you had time, budget, or a team for?\u201d\nTo date, Portal A has backed 25+ Moonshot projects, ranging from short films to TikTok-native formats and even feature-length documentaries.\nBuilding for a New Viewing Context\nThe trend is bigger than any one initiative. Viewership behavior is shifting dramatically:\n- YouTube Shorts sees over 200 billion daily views, according to YouTube CEO Neal Mohan.\n- TikTok users spend over 50 minutes per day on the app in the U.S. alone.\n- According to a Deloitte research study, more than 50% of Gen Z viewers prefer short-form over traditional long-form TV programming.\nBlume connects the dots: \u201cPeople are watching short-form content like they used to watch TV. But the platforms are different. The formats are different. The creators are different.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s emerging is a new kind of entertainment, shows with recurring segments, arcs and characters, built specifically for social. We\u2019re seeing the rise of creator-led franchises like Hot Ones, Keep the Meter Running, and Boy Room; proof that audiences will tune in and come back for originality.\nA Creative Counterculture Is Emerging\nWhile the loudest voices in the creator economy often chase spectacle and virality, a growing movement of creators is focused on storytelling, structure, and originality. Groups like Creator Camp are experimenting with short films and serialized formats on tight budgets showing what\u2019s possible when creativity leads. It\u2019s part of a broader shift from content to craft.\nThe Third Cultures Example\nOne Moonshots standout is Third Cultures, a food-and-travel social series created with Korean-American creator Jaeki Cho.\n\u201cJaeki went to Prato, Italy, where there\u2019s a large Chinese immigrant community. The show explored the fusion of Chinese and Italian cultures through food, language, daily life,\u201d said Blume. \u201cIt\u2019s a fresh take on a travel show. Not celebrity-driven. Creator-driven. And it resonated, millions and millions of views.\u201d\nThat kind of format, part docuseries, part culinary exploration, all optimized for vertical video, is exactly what\u2019s rising on platforms like TikTok and Instagram.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the birth of formats that feel native to the platform but still have the weight and craft of TV,\u201d Blume added. \u201cIt\u2019s where TikTok meets Anthony Bourdain.\u201d\nOwning the IP, Not Just the Attention\nPortal A isn\u2019t just experimenting for the sake of virality. Moonshots is also a long-term strategy to build original intellectual property.\n\u201cSome of these projects can live as short-form, but others we\u2019re scaling into long-form shows, brand partnerships, or even traditional distribution,\u201d Blume said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pipeline for IP that starts creator-first.\u201d\nImportantly, the goal isn\u2019t to \u201cgraduate\u201d to TV. Many creators are already building massive reach and relevance within social ecosystems \u2014 and they\u2019re staying there by choice. Even athletes and celebrities are embracing this shift, developing social-native formats from scratch, like NBA star Anthony Edwards\u2019 Year Five series on YouTube, created with Portal A.\nThat\u2019s a key evolution in the creator economy: creators are no longer just influencers; they\u2019re studios in the making. And for Portal A, investing in creators means investing in future franchises.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to replicate what creators are already doing. We\u2019re asking, what\u2019s your moonshot? Let\u2019s build that.\u201d\nWhat This Means for Brands\nAs creators innovate with new storytelling formats, brands have a unique opportunity to shift from sponsor to studio partner. Blume noted that the most progressive brands have already begun to embrace this change.\n\u201cThe best brand partners are funding creativity,\u201d said Blume. \u201cThey\u2019re leaning into creator-led series, backing original IP and getting in early when a format is being shaped.\u201d\nFor marketers, that means rethinking what branded content can be. Instead of one-off influencer campaigns or mid-rolls, brands can:\n- Partner with creators on show concepts that align with their values and customer interests.\n- Invest early in IP that could scale beyond social.\n- Co-own content platforms where audiences return weekly.\nThis also requires more trust and creative flexibility. \u201cThe traditional ad model was built around control,\u201d Blume said. \u201cThis space rewards collaboration. You have to let creators do what they do best, and your brand will benefit from the authenticity.\u201d\nWhat This Means for Creators\nThis trend opens new creative and commercial pathways for creators looking to move beyond sponsorships and ad reads.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a place for integrations,\u201d said Blume. \u201cBut we think creators have stories to tell that deserve more time, more depth, more ambition.\u201d\nFor creators, that could mean:\n- Launching your own social-native series instead of one-off videos.\n- Collaborating with studios like Portal A to build new formats.\n- Thinking about IP ownership and licensing, not just monetization.\n- Pitching bold, unconventional ideas that don\u2019t neatly fit into brand briefs.\n\u201cThe most exciting creators are the ones building something that didn\u2019t exist a year ago,\u201d Blume emphasized. \u201cWe want to help them do that.\u201d\nSocial TV Is Just Getting Started\nFor all the hype around short-form, Blume sees this moment as foundational.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still early. We\u2019re just scratching the surface of what social TV can be,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tools are here. The audiences are here. The creators are here. Now it\u2019s about who\u2019s going to put it all together and build the next big thing.\u201d\nWith Moonshots, Portal A is making its bet. And for creators watching the trends, don\u2019t just post. Build a show. Tell a story. Create something that lasts longer than the scroll.\nThis article is based on an interview with Zach from my podcast, The Business of Creators."

      "text": "Hollywood once represented the pinnacle of success in entertainment by setting the standards for storytelling, production quality and star power, but that may be changing. The creator economy is rewriting the rules as creators build independent pathways to success\u2014self-funding projects, attracting massive audiences and changing what it means to be a star.\nYet, as creators redefine entertainment, they can also learn from Hollywood\u2019s time-tested practices.\nFor example, the popular YouTube video I Trapped 25 Strangers in a House produced by Eric Decker, the popular creator known as Airrack, is a YouTube twist on the Big Brother format. Yet, Airrack didn\u2019t just replicate Big Brother\u2014he deconstructed its formula.\nAirrack analyzed the show\u2019s structure, from pacing to character dynamics, to understand what keeps audiences hooked, then condensed an entire season\u2019s worth of drama into a 20-minute episode. He even hired a Big Brother post-production supervisor to help structure the shoot to ensure quality.\nSince its release in 2022, the video has racked up over 21 million views and sparked other reality format adaptations, proving that the same elements of strategy and social dynamics that drive traditional reality TV can work just as well on YouTube.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nA New Generation Of Media And Production Experts\nAirrack commands over 15 million subscribers and averages 4 million views daily on YouTube. He has built a massive following through bold challenges, pranks and collaborations with mega creators and brands like Shopify, SoFi and Pizza Hut. For Pizza Hut, he even broke the Guinness World Record for the world\u2019s most giant pizza\u2014a stunt featured in a Super Bowl commercial.\nBeneath his high-energy persona, though, Airrack is a dedicated student of YouTube who takes a sophisticated, data-driven approach to maximize what works on the platform.\nAirrack\u2019s longtime business partner, Zack Honarvar, explained that his approach is a \u201chybrid\u201d\u2014combining Hollywood\u2019s expertise with YouTube\u2019s unique demands. Airrack also emphasized that while Hollywood might view YouTube as unstructured and informal, the reality is quite different. Airrack\u2019s team operates with 60-page creative briefs, detailed shot lists and a sophisticated production process that has been fine-tuned for digital audiences.\nBridging Hollywood And The Creator Economy\nThis blending of traditional media approaches with digital-first strategies was a central theme at the recent Future of Television Conference, produced by Digital Media Wire. For the first time, the event included a dedicated creator track, spotlighting how Hollywood and the creator economy can combine forces to create a new era of entertainment. The conference brought together Hollywood veterans, marketers, creator economy executives and top creators to explore this evolving landscape, not as rivals but as collaborators.\nThe Value Of Building Long-Term IP And Repeatable Formats\nOne of the most significant insights from the event centered on the importance of developing long-term, ownable IP and repeatable formats\u2014areas where Hollywood has long excelled.\nKevin Kurtz, CEO and co-founder of Bigger Bolder Baking, a digital-first baking empire he built with his wife, world-renowned chef Gemma Stafford, shared his approach to creating \u201cdurable brands\u201d through recognizable and repeatable content structures that resonate with audiences over time. He explained that this strategy could transform a fleeting viral moment into lasting cultural relevance\u2014something Hollywood has mastered through franchises and format-driven shows.\nCreators are learning the value of repeatable formats, intellectual property (IP) and long-term brand identity while Hollywood has begun to recognize the agility, audience-first mindset and direct engagement that creators bring. It\u2019s no longer a question of Hollywood vs. the Creator Economy; rather, the future of entertainment may well depend on a shared approach, where both worlds can coexist and learn from each other.\nCoco Mocoe, Creator and Host of Middle Row w/ Coco Mocoe, expanded on this by emphasizing the value of consistency and repetition in building brand identity.\nShe cited Chicken Shop Date, created by Amelia Dimoldenberg, as a prime example of a format-driven show that took years to achieve mass appeal but has now become a cultural staple, featuring guests like Jack Harlow, Jennifer Lawrence and Billie Eilish. \u201cCreators need to think about sustainable formats that aren\u2019t just TikTok trends,\u201d Mocoe said, underscoring that creators who build distinctive, repeatable formats stand a much better chance of creating lasting brands that succeed beyond social media.\nGreenlighting Power And Audience Connection\nThis focus on IP and formats led to a discussion about greenlighting power, moderated by Lia Haberman, founder of the ICYMI newsletter. In Haberman\u2019s session \u201cCreators Get No Respect: Is Hollywood Missing Out?\u201d Taryn Crouthers, President of ATTN, highlighted how greenlighting decisions in Hollywood often rest with a select few executives who, as she pointed out, may lack a direct connection to the audiences they now serve.\nCrouthers stressed that creators who live and breathe audience engagement are uniquely suited to make content decisions based on real-time feedback. \u201cCreators are like mini, fully integrated studios,\u201d she noted. \u201cThey\u2019re the talent, the production, the marketing, and the distribution\u2014all based on direct interactions with millions of viewers.\u201d She even predicted that a creator would run a studio with full greenlight authority one day, blending Hollywood\u2019s resources with creators\u2019 audience-first expertise.\nRedefining Premium In A New Era\nJawhara Tariq, SVP Corporate Development for Mythical Entertainment (of Good Mythical Morning fame) also highlighted the shifting perception of \u201cpremium\u201d content. \u201cThere\u2019s still this huge gap where \u2018premium\u2019 means traditional TV, cable, or theatrical releases,\u201d she said. \u201cBut premium, in today\u2019s world, is defined by engagement. If people are watching, that\u2019s premium.\u201d\nTariq\u2019s view challenges Hollywood\u2019s assumption that success requires audiences to revert to paying $100 monthly for legacy channels, especially when platforms like YouTube and TikTok offer highly engaging content that viewers can access for free.\nAs creators like Airrack demonstrate, it\u2019s not the budget or polish that determines value; it\u2019s the connection with the audience.\nA Niche-Driven Future For Hollywood And Creators\nAndrew Wallenstein, Chief Media Analyst at Variety Intelligence Platform, noted that the future of entertainment will likely be niche-driven rather than mass-audience-focused. \u201cHollywood still thinks in terms of broad audiences, but the creator economy is about niche,\u201d he observed. Creators are pioneering a new wave of targeted, highly engaged communities\u2014a shift Hollywood could embrace to cultivate smaller, loyal fanbases. Embracing this approach could open doors to new business models focusing on engagement and loyalty rather than reach alone.\u201d\nCollaboration Is The Key To Success\nAs Hollywood and the creator economy combine their expertise, the future of entertainment looks increasingly collaborative. Creators learn the importance of IP, format development, and brand longevity from Hollywood while Hollywood adapts to digital platforms' agile, audience-first approach.\nThe real winners in this evolving landscape won\u2019t be Hollywood or the creator economy alone \u2014 but those who can blend the best of both worlds."

Samsung\u2019s strategy includes signing creators such as Dhar Mann and Michelle Khare for dedicated FAST channels, while Tubi\u2019s rapid growth to 50+ creators and 5,000 episodes demonstrates a shift toward curated, brand\u2011safe content. Marketers are drawn to CTV because it offers premium placement, integrated sponsorships, and higher trust levels compared to one\u2011off influencer posts. Creators benefit from larger budgets, longer\u2011form storytelling, and the chance to own IP, while brands can partner across multiple screens to reach audiences more effectively. The trend signals a convergence of traditional TV and creator\u2011driven content, creating new opportunities for both creators and advertisers.",
