  "title": "Hands on: I tried the new MSI Claw A8 at Gamescom 2025 and AMD\u2019s Z2 Extreme chip was nothing but an extreme let down",
  "description": "Yes\u2026 another gaming handheld",
  "content": "The MSI Claw A8 Z2 Extreme has the potential to be a very exciting handheld gaming PC. However, while going hands-on with it at Gamescom 2025, I wasn't as impressed with the performance of the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme as I was hoping to be. Hopefully, in our full review we'll be able to dig into why this is.\n\nWhy you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test.\n\nThe MSI Claw A8 Z2 Extreme is yet another gaming PC handheld to hit the market. Taking all of the positives of the previous iteration of the MSI Claw, the MSI Claw A8 Z2 Extreme seems promising on paper, being the first gaming handheld to pack the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, potentially giving gamers a whole new level of performance right in the palm of their hands.\n\nIn terms of availability, the MSI Claw A8 Z2 Extreme has been slowly released over the past few months as different regions start to stock the device. The UK is still waiting for its opportunity to purchase, as well as the US, and with the new Asus ROG Xbox Ally hitting the shelves soon, it may be a race to the finish line in terms of the first device featuring AMD\u2019s new chip to be on the shelf.\n\nHowever, using the device at Gamescom 2025 actually proved to be a rather mediocre experience, and this wasn\u2019t the fault of the handheld but rather the processor itself. While the device looked snazzy and was comfortable to use, it didn\u2019t quite deliver the performance boost I was expecting from AMD\u2019s latest chip, and instead felt practically identical to the AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme.\n\nNot only are my expectations for the device tainted, but I\u2019m worried about the progression of handhelds in general if this level of performance is meant to be seen as an upgrade. Oh dear.\n\nThe price of the MSI Claw A8 Z2 Extreme varies from region to region and with no stock available in the US or UK just yet, we don\u2019t have a confirmed price.\n\nHowever, with sales already underway in Germany starting at \u20ac999, we can therefore assume it will be at a similar price point in both dollars and pounds, though exchange rates, local taxes and tariffs will likely have an impact.\n\nThis is particularly expensive when compared to alternative handheld gaming devices on the market. However, this is currently the only gaming handheld to feature the brand new AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, which makes direct price comparison difficult. The previous MSI Claw was \u00a3899 / $899 on release, and other alternatives like the Asus ROG Ally X come in at around \u00a3799 / $799 with frequent sales and price cuts.\n\nRight now, there's no confirmed release date for the MSI Claw A8 Z2 Extreme for most of the world, but with it being on shelves in some areas of Europe, we shouldn\u2019t be waiting too long.\n\nIn terms of design, the MSI Claw A8 Z2 Extreme comes in a fancy new colorway, Neon Green.\n\nBeing honest, I found this new color absolutely repugnant, but this is more of a personal taste issue rather than it being a major problem. Despite not being a fan, I can be the bigger person and admit that this new color definitely sets the device apart from the monochrome sea of gaming handhelds which are on the market right now.\n\nYou get an 8-inch screen which is just slightly higher in resolution than your standard 1080p at 1920x1200. Pair this with the variable 120Hz refresh rate, and this screen is one of the best options on the gaming handheld market.\n\nThe only thing that would improve this display would be if it was OLED. It was gorgeous to look at and would make a great option for both casual and competitive gamers alike - if competitive gamers would ever dare to play ranked on a gaming handheld.\n\nThe chassis definitely feels more \u2018gamery\u2019 in style when compared to its predecessor, with a more aggressive shape and clear cut edges rather than that smooth and sleek finish which we\u2019re familiar with. Despite this, it was still comfortable to hold.\n\nComing in at 765g, it's one of the heavier devices on the market; the Asus ROG Ally X, for example, weighs less than 700g. This is to be expected given the difference in screens, but doesn\u2019t detract from the fact that the handheld feels like it's slightly weighing you down while you\u2019re playing it, but it didn\u2019t cause any major issues.\n\nIn terms of specifications, the MSI Claw A8 Z2 Extreme looks fantastic on paper, however the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme does majorly let it down. While using the device, I found that I wasn\u2019t really getting any better performance when compared to the Z1 Extreme chip found in other (cheaper) gaming handhelds.\n\nIt managed good quality graphics in the games I played on the handheld, with solid frame rates which didn\u2019t look or feel choppy. However, since this was just a brief hands-on session I wasn\u2019t able to actually monitor the frame rates while playing, and it really didn\u2019t feel like the device was delivering any significant boost in performance on a surface level.\n\nAside from this, you also get 24GB of RAM, a major upgrade from some of the previous generation gaming handhelds. Lower RAM in previous handhelds has posed issues in the past, so it's nice to see MSI learning from the mistakes of their competitors.\n\nYou also get a chunky 80Wh battery, the same as the previous iteration of the MSI Claw. While it would have been nice for this to have been improved upon, it seems like this is slowly becoming industry standard.\n\nI wasn\u2019t able to actually monitor the battery level during my hands-on time with the device, but the AMD Ryzen Z2 series of chips come with a promise of better efficiency so we\u2019ll have to wait for a full review to see if this proves to be true.\n\nAll in all, I feel like I was somewhat underwhelmed with the MSI Claw A8 Z2 Extreme, but that wasn\u2019t down to the device itself but rather the processor from AMD.\n\nThe device was comfortable to hold, looked stunning (apart from the new neon green colorway, sorry) and has a promising battery capacity.\n\nHowever, with a high price point and a processor which wasn\u2019t delivering that boost in performance that I was expecting over its predecessor, it\u2019s hard to recommend picking up the MSI Claw A8 Z2 Extreme based on first impressions alone. Our full review, where we'll put the MSI Claw A8 Z2 Extreme through our suite of benchmark and real-world tests, should determine if it deserves a place amongst the best gaming handhelds.",

Xbox says both of these details will be shared in the coming weeks, which could be an indication of pre-orders opening in September.\nThe leaks previously hinted at pre-orders going live on August 20. While this hasn't exactly panned out as suggested, it's the date that was expected for Xbox and Asus' announcement of a release date, and the rumor of an October 16 release date was spot on.\nTaking cues from the Steam Deck\nXbox has also announced a 'Handheld Compatibility Program', which appears to follow in the footsteps of Valve's SteamOS and the Deck Verified system. This will help players identify which games are playable or compatible with their Xbox Ally device. It will also come alongside a feature called 'Windows Performance Fit' indicator, which will help 'reflect expected performance on their supported device'.\nTo ensure a console-like handheld experience, Xbox is using an Advanced Shader Delivery feature, built to preload any game shaders during downloads, to dive right into games once ready.\nThese features are expected to come alongside the 'full-screen experience' that is supposed to help streamline the handheld experience on Windows, without unnecessary background processes and more RAM for games.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nYou might also like...\n- Microsoft's Windows 11 is a detriment to handheld gaming PCs \u2013 and a recent SteamOS comparison highlights that\n- Microsoft's 'if you can't beat them, join them' approach to the threat of Steam in the new Xbox PC app is a great idea\n- I don't see how Microsoft's Xbox PC app will win me over \u2013 especially when I'm obsessed with SteamOS\nIsaiah is a Staff Writer for the Computing channel at TechRadar.

      "text": "MSI opens up preorders on the new Claw 8 AI+ and Claw 7 AI+ with Intel Lunar Lake SoC\nThe MSI Claw 8 AI+ pre-orders launched this morning, with a delivery date in early February\n- The MSI Claw 8 AI+ and MSI Claw 7 AI+ are MSI's second-gen gaming handhelds\n- Both handhelds are powered by the Intel Core Ultra 7 258V with Intel Arc Xe2 graphics\n- Preorder the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Claw 7 AI+ at Amazon, Best Buy, or the MSI store\nMSI launched its latest gaming handhelds, the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and MSI Claw 7 AI+, this week, following up on its inaugural MSI Claw that launched earlier this year.\nThe new MSI Claw handhelds will feature the Intel Core Ultra 7 258V system-on-a-chip (SoC), which features Intel's new Arc Xe2 graphics architecture for improved gaming performance and efficiency. The first MSI Claw featured Intel's previous generation SoC, and the handheld received somewhat mixed reviews regarding performance.\nWith the second-generation Intel Core Ultra 7 chip, however, the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Claw 7 AI+ should be able to move past the problems of its predecessor. Though, we won't know for sure until we get our hands on one ourselves.\nIn addition to the Core Ultra 7 chip, the Claw 8 AI+ will feature an 8-inch 1200p, 120Hz display with 100% sRGB color gamut and up to 500 nits brightness. It also comes with 32GB LPDDR5x-8533 RAM (impressive for a gaming handheld), a 1TB PCIe SSD, and a massive 80 WHr battery with 65W USB 3.,0 power delivery.\nThe Claw 7 AI+, meanwhile, differs from the above only in its screen size \u2013 it's 7 inches rather than 8 inches \u2013 and a smaller 54.5 WHr battery.\nThe MSI Claw 8 AI+ is available for preorder now at Best Buy, Amazon, and the MSI Store for $899.99 in the US, while the Claw 7 AI+ is available for $799.99 (about \u00a3700 / \u00a3630, respectively, in the UK, and about AU$1,400 / AU$1,245 in Australia, though UK and Australia availability and pricing have not yet been confirmed).\nTime to get excited for the MSI Claw again?\nWhen the original MSI Claw debuted at CES 2024, I was as excited as anyone to see what the new handheld, the first powered by an Intel chip, could do. With the Intel Core Ultra 100-series SoC, the first Claw had some things going for it, such as hardware accelerated upscaling via XeSS, the first gaming handheld to do so.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nUnfortunately, the gaming performance of the Intel Core Ultra 100-series chips was somewhat underwhelming, especially compared to the AMD Z1 chips powering devices like the Lenovo Legion Go and Asus ROG Ally.\nHowever, the new MSI Claws might be in a much better position this time, thanks to Intel's upgraded Lunar Lake chips. In the laptops we've been able to test with Intel Core Ultra 200-series chips, their performance has been fantastic, and their gaming performance has been surprisingly excellent.\nPair that with improved energy efficiency from the re-engineered Intel architecture, and you might have a gaming handheld that gets fantastic performance and much longer battery life \u2013 two things that can make or break a gaming handheld's appeal.\nI can't say yet whether the new Claw models can deliver, but in my limited time previewing the Claw 8 AI+ at IFA 2024, it did seem to be a very different beast than the original. Was it enough to justify an $899.99 price tag? That remains to be seen.\nYou might also like\nJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.\nNamed by the CTA as a CES 2020 Media Trailblazer for his science and technology reporting, John specializes in all areas of computer science, including industry news, hardware reviews, PC gaming, as well as general science writing and the social impact of the tech industry.\nYou can find him online on Bluesky @johnloeffler.bsky.social"

If you're just tuning in, then don't worry - you haven't missed anything yet!\nWith the show set to take this evening, I'll be walking you through the build up, sharing the latest news as it happens, and a few of my own personal predictions then bringing you a steady stream of announcements once the broadcast begins.\nICYMI: the latest Nintendo Direct is underway\nIt's not technically part of Gamescom, but the timing of this latest Nintendo Direct is definitely deliberate and likely an attempt by Nintendo to squeeze in their own short presentation before attention shifts to the big Opening Night Live show.\nThe Direct is focused on the upcoming racing game Kirby Air Riders, and is our first real look at the title since its announcement back the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct earlier this year.\nThe broadcast is currently live right now, so you can tune in if you're interested in learning all about it.\nIs Hollow Knight: Silksong news on the cards?\nHollow Knight: Silksong is easily one of the most anticipated games right now. A sequel to the 2017 indie hit, fans have been waiting for more news about this upcoming instalment for more than six years.\nCould we hear more about it tonight? It's definitely likely, as presenter Geoff Keighley has been teasing something Silksong related.\nYesterday, he posted a photo of himself wearing a clown nose to his X / Twitter account, captioned \"First time? See you tomorrow for Gamescom ONL.\" It might not seem like much, but it's a reference popular meme featuring the protagonist of Hollow Knight wearing a similar clown costume.\nFirst time? \ud83e\udd21 See you tomorrow for @gamescom ONL. pic.twitter.com/59ef5sFysJAugust 18, 2025\nHe actually posted the original meme last year, alongside clarification that there would be \"no Silksong\", so this seems like an intentional call-back.\nHopefully we're in for some kind of exciting update regarding the game tonight.\nWe're in for a live music performance\nGeoff Keighley has confirmed that we will be in some music tonight.\nIt will be the first ever live performance of music from the popular RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from composers Alice Duport-Percier and Lorien Testard.\nExactly which songs will be performed is currently up in the air, but lovers of the game definitely won't want to miss this...\nShare your own thoughts or predictions\nHave any burning Opening Night Live thoughts or predictions?\nYou can send them my way by posting to X / Twitter and tagging us @techradar! Alternatively, you can email me directly using the handy email button at the top of my author page.\nWhether you have created your own bingo card, have a list of wild hopes and dreams, or just want to offer some comments on the whole Opening Night Show, I'll be sharing the very best contributions here on this page throughout the evening.\nJust remember to keep it PG, or I'll get in big trouble with my boss and we don't want that, do we?\nExpect a Lords of the Fallen 2 reveal\nIt looks like Lords of the Fallen 2 will be revealed later tonight, following a fairly transparent teaser posted by the official Lords of the Fallen X / Twitter account.\nThe image, which shows part of a character in gothic armor, features the word \"tonight\" with the letter \"i\" replaced by the Roman numeral for two.\nThe knightmare looms\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ZR1KNE9wa1August 19, 2025\nI was a fan of the latest Lords of the Fallen game, which released back in 2023. In fact, I did a expansive cover feature with a multiple-page preview of the title back when I worked on the UK's PlayStation Magazine, so it's a series that's pretty close to my heart\nDespite the name, Lords of the Fallen 2 would actually be the third Lords of the Fallen game. That's because of 2014's Lords of the Fallen, which is not to be confused with its 2023 successor.\nOur agents on the ground have arrived\nI might be stuck behind a computer screen this year, but that doesn't mean that we don't have some agents on the ground right now.\nMy colleagues Rhys and Rob reached Cologne, Germany, this morning and are currently scouting things out and attending a few early appointments ahead of Opening Night Live.\nThey tell me it's quite quiet over there at the moment, as I'm sure you can imagine, but I'm expecting all of that to change as the show nears.\nThere will be a ZZZ car at Gamescom 2025\nThis is a bit of a weird one, but I have received confirmation that there will be at least one automobile present in the halls at Gamescom 2025.\nIt's a special version of the Aston Martin Vantage coupe, with custom artwork based on the Victoria Housekeeping Co. faction from Zenless Zone Zero.\nIt will be showed off at the game's booth in Hall 6, booth C-031, where visitors will be able to bask in all of its glory. Those going to the booth will also be able to complete check-in missions, and win prizes including a special 1:18 scale model of the Aston Martin car.\nYou can find full details on the competition via the X / Twitter post below.\nAston Martin \u00d7 Zenless Zone Zero Collab: Gamescom Event AnnouncementDear Proxies, complete missions at the event site to receive exclusive collab merch! You'll also have a chance to win a limited edition 1:18 scale model car of the 2024 Aston Martin Vantage!#zzzero\u2026 pic.twitter.com/6JsKf8qBh7August 18, 2025\nLast year Hoyoverse had a huge booth in the public area, and I expect Gamescom 2025 to be no different.\nThe brand's presence at the trade show also suggests that there will be some interesting announcements during the Opening Night Live show, potentially new seasonal content for games Zenless Zone Zero or Genshin Impact.\nWe're going to learn all things Black Ops 7\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 will be getting an expansive trailer as part of Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025. The follow-up to the successful Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, this next entry takes the series back to a futuristic setting for the first time in years.\nIt's set in 2035 and will feature a co-op campaign set right after the events of Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. As usual, you can expect expect a wealth of multiplayer modes and a separate zombies mode too.\nThe game was first revealed back in the June Xbox Games Showcase, with a trippy cinematic trailer that showed off its dark tone and plenty of futuristic technology.\nWe also know that Black Ops 2 protagonist David Mason will be returning. Leaks also indicate that fan-favorite villain Raul Menendez will play an import role in the plot, which is set to take place across both Japan and Avalon - a fictional European city featured in Black Ops 6.\nThe game is set to release on November 14, 2025, so it's about time we learned more about it.\nWe've finally got some Hollow Knight: Silksong news!\nThis is not a drill - we finally have some official news about Hollow Knight: Silksong!\nDeveloper Team Cherry will be hosting a 'Hollow Knight: Silksong - Special Announcement' in just under 48 hours time.\nWhat will this 'special announcement' be? It's too early to say, but I think that it's almost certainly going to be a release date of some kind.\nBloomberg reporter Jason Schreier is claiming that there won't be a Silksong release date tonight, but I wouldn't be surprised if we still see a trailer.\nNot feeling the hype? Check out this sizzle reel\nYou can catch a Gamescom Opening Night Live sizzle reel over on the official Game Awards YouTube channel, potentially giving us some insight into what's in store.\nIt features loads of titles, with some of the most significant being Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Ghost of Yotei, and Resident Evil Requiem. I also spotted some Silent Hill f in there, not to mention a clip from the Fallout TV show.\nJust under three hours to go...\nWe're now just under three hours away from the start of the Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 show!\nThat's plenty of time to get anything done that you might want out of the way before the action begins. You're going to want to make sure that you have a clear schedule, as this year's show is shaping up to be massive.\nQueues are starting to form\nGeoff Keighley has posted an update from the Opening Night Live 2025 venue, showing plenty of eager gamers waiting to get in to the show.\nFans have been lining up all day to get into @gamescom ONL tonight -- see you all soon!! pic.twitter.com/RCrwRXajDDAugust 19, 2025\nTickets are currently sold-out, so I'm expecting the hall to be absolutely packed tonight.\nDon't forget about the pre-show!\nThe main Gamescom Opening Night Live stream might be the biggest attraction, but that doesn't mean that you should forget about the pre-show.\nSet to start 30 minutes before the main event, Keighley has already confirmed that it will \"have multiple new game announcements\".\nThey're generally smaller titles than the ones that that are featured in the main event, but if you have an interest in indies you might see something that you really like the look of.\nYou'll be able to watch it via the regular Opening Night Live stream too, so it's the perfect thing to have on in the background before the event begins in full.\nThe cutest gaming hardware of Gamescom?\nRemember those early appointments that I mentioned? My colleague Rob has just been to see ASUS and spotted some absolutely adorable PC hardware.\nIt comes as part of the Asus x Hatsune Miku collection, with special TUF gaming gear based on the design of the iconic virtual singer. All of it looks incredible, and I'd love to have it as part of my PC setup.\nI most like the look of the special edition TUF Gaming H1 Gen 2 headset, not to mention the TUF Gaming Mini Wireless Mouse and TUF Gaming K3 Gen 2 keyboard. Of course, the matching TUF Gaming P1 mouse pad is an essential too.\nCould this be the cutest gaming hardware that we will see over Gamescom? It's a definite possibility.\nWe'll be getting new info on the Fallout TV show\nWe already know that we will be seeing more of the Fallout TV show tonight in a first look at its second season.\nI was a big fan of the original season, which is an Amazon Prime Video exclusive. The storytelling isn't the best around, but it's still an impressively faithful adaptation of the games' world. It's got plenty of action and a surprising amount of gore, but also the franchise's trademark comedic elements to balance it all out.\nI'm hoping that we will see some other Fallout reveals tonight on top of the show, ideally a remaster or remake of one of the older games. With the second season on the way, it would be the perfect time to revisit Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas.\nPlayable Silksong has been sighted!\nFull #SilkSong Nintendo Booth @ Gamescom pic.twitter.com/xMdlIQpfwpAugust 19, 2025\nHere's some big news for anyone waiting for Hollow Knight: Silksong out there.\nThe game will apparently be available to play at a large Gamescom booth in a demo that seems to be running on Nintnedo Switch 2 systems.\nThe information comes from a streamer, who has posted some interesting videos that they claim were taken from inside the halls at Gamescom.\nThe demo stations currently appear to be password protected though, so I don't think we're going to see any real gameplay until the event is fully open.\nJust one hour to go...\nHere's an important time reminder for you!\nThe Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 show is now exactly one hour away with the pre-show set to begin in just 30 minutes.\nGrab some snacks and get comfy, because it will be here before you know it...\nOur on-site team are starting to head to the venue\nI've just received an update from our crew on the ground, who are now busy making their way over to the Opening Night Live venue.\nI'll be able to give you some updates on what the atmosphere is like over there once they arrive!\nThe first Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 images are here!\nThe Xbox store page for Black Ops 7 has been updated ahead of the show, giving us our first look at some in-game screenshots!\nWe see plenty of robots, as you might expect given the futuristic setting, and what are likely some launch multiplayer maps. There are also some soldiers wearing very Black Ops 2 inspired body armor, plus a glimpse of the Zombies crew.\nYou can see them all for yourself here.\nWe've arrived!\nOur team has arrived at Gamescom 2025!\nHere's the current situation outside the convention center. It's not super busy, but we already know from Keighley's posts that lots of people are waiting indoors for Opening Night Live 2025 to begin.\nLook at that lovely clear sky though. I'm a little jealous...\nThe pre-show has officially begun\nHold on to something! The Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 pre-show has officially begun. Now is the time to get the stream open in your browser window (or tune in above), as the announcements start right now.\nThe pre-show is usually home to smaller indie games, with the bigger reveals saved for the main event. That doesn't mean that it isn't worth watching though, as you might see something that you really like the look of.\nFresh photos from the show\nMy team on the ground has been feeding me a steady stream of photos from inside the hall, where the atmosphere looks electric.\nYou can browse some of them above, including a beautiful selfie from both Rob and Rhys. Look how happy they are!\nThe Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 show has started!\nIt's happening folks!\nThe Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 show has now started.\nThe man, the myth, the legend Geoff Keighley is on stage right now, so expect the announcements to start coming thick and fast.\nOf course, I'll be here to keep you up to date with everything as it happens.\nHere's a look at Keighley's outfit for the night - not too shabby. Not sure about the tan shoes, though...\nHe's currently welcoming the audience to the show and has said that \"E3 didn't die, it just moved right here to Germany.\"\nHe has now moved on to the usual talk about the industry, reflecting on the success of indie games Peak and Date Everything...\nWe've now moved onto Hollow Knight: Silksong, which Keighley promises will launch this year! There's some gameplay on screen too!\nWas that it? That was about ten seconds of Silksong action. Hopefully the upcoming Team Cherry stream will shed a lot more light on the game.\nWe're starting with Black Ops 7!\nIt looks like we're going to kick things off properly with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7!\nThe trailer seems to be really focusing on the campaign, showing some absolutely bonkers looking visuals with scenes of twisting skyscrapers and all kinds of strangeness.\nWe're also getting a look at what I assume is the central cast of characters, which makes sense given the apparent co-op focus.\nAnd a quick look at multiplayer too it seems and zombies! Now the developers are on stage to outline some of the themes of the game and explore its 2035 setting.\nOh! Now some more details on the co-op campaign. It will be playable with up to four players, or solo if you prefer.\nIt seems that missions will be quite open this time around, which is reminding me a little too much of the incredibly lacklustre open-world levels in Modern Warfare 3.\nEver wondered if Keighley is reading an auto-cue? Our team on the ground can now officially confirm... yes!\nLords of the Fallen 2 revealed!\nNo we're on to the first proper game reveal of the show!\nIt's Lords of the Fallen 2, in a flashy cinematic trailer that showcases some impressive looking visuals. It's got the same style as its predecessor, but is set 100 years after the previous game.\nKeighley described it as both \"bloodier\" and \"faster\", which is promising! It's set to come out in 2026\nHere's an unexpected reveal!\nAn anime based on Sekiro Shadows Die Twice called Sekiro No Defeat has been unveiled. It will be available on the Crunchyroll streaming service.\nA new Lego Batman game is coming\nA new Lego game has been shown off, and it looks stunning! Lego Batman Legacy of the Dark Knight.\nIt seems to have a massive open world, plus some Arkham series inspired combat. It'll be here in 2026.\nA developer is on stage to tell us that Lego Legacy of the Dark Knight demo will be available on the show floor.\nThe game will track the entire of Bruce Wayne's journey it seems, with plenty of iconic moments and \"deep cut references\".\nAs with previous Lego games, I'm expecting a wide roster of playable characters taken from across the Batman universe.\nOn to the next game, a \"long awaited sequel\" that fans have been eager to see...\nNo, it's not Bloodborne 2.\nIt's a new Warhammer strategy game! Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4!\nIt will be out in 2026!\nSome Monster Hunter Wilds news now! A Final Fantasy 14 collaboration, plus a new Title Update that introduces a new monster.\nBoth are coming in \"late September\" - whatever that means.\nRy\u014dz\u014d Tsujimoto and Naoki Yoshida (or Yoshi-P) from Capcom have taken to the stage to discuss the crossover!\nThis upcoming crossover apparently came about after the success of a similar Final Fantasy crossover in Monster Hunter World.\nOur resident Final Fantasy 14-head Rhys, who is currently sat watching the show in Cologne, is very happy with this news it seems.\nWe've just seen some screenshots of the event in Final Fantasy 14, with a new mount and what looks like a Monster Hunter Wilds quest.\nThat is coming later this year in October.\nWhat the heck is this? Some kind of horror game, I thought it was Resident Evil at first but now I'm not sure if it's another Capcom title or not.\nTurns out it's not a game! It's a trailer for... Gamescom?\nSome Onimusha: Way of the Sword action now!\nIt looks like a lot of fun, with some meaty combat and creepy, undead enemies in an ancient Japanese setting.\nSome kind of anime game now? I think we might be back.\nWe're seeing loads of interesting visuals, it looks like it'll be some kind of factory management game? With some combat thrown in there too.\nHow unique!\nIt's Arknights: Endfield! Off the top of my head, that's one that's been announced for some time, but the fresh look is still appreciated.\nA proper strategy game sequel now!\nEuropa Universalis 5 - fans of staring at maps all day will undoubtedly love this one.\nA fresh Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion trailer! There's a demo available today, if you're interested in trying out a cool-looking mech game.\nA little first-person shooter game now, called Voidbreaker. It's out now!\nWe have actors on stage!\nI repeat, actors on stage. Some of the cast of the Fallout TV show are here, to discuss the upcoming season. It sounds like it will be a direct continuation of the first season, which probably isn't much of a surprise.\nNow it's time for a teaser trailer ahead of the season's release in December!\nHere's a quick look at the posters for that upcoming season!\nNow it's time for some Indiana Jones DLC action\nTime for a proper look at the The Order of Giants DLC for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.\nIt looks like the perfect continuation of everything that made the base game so good, and it'll be here on September 4.\nWonder what I thought of the original game? Check out my Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review!\nWe also just got confirmation that the game will be coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026!\nAnother trailer for the Deadpool VR game. It sure looks like a Deadpool game, and it's absolutely in VR.\nIt's coming as a Meta Quest 3 and 3S exclusive.\nTime for a fresh world premiere!\nThere's a tank on screen, are we looking at some kind of World of Tanks spinoff? Maybe a strategy game? Let's see...\nI called it! It's World of Tanks 2.0 - the \"biggest update in the game's history\".\nTime for some John Carpenter's Toxic Commando action in an extended gameplay trailer. It's got co-op, it's got shooting, and it's sure got some weird mutant enemies.\nThe game is set to release in \"early 2026\".\nTime for something a bit different, a game called Death by Scrolling.\nIt's a roguelike set in purgatory, with cute pixel graphics. The big feature of this one seems to be that the screen is constantly scrolling upwards as you play, which is pretty unique.\nOh, you'll also be chased by the grim reaper - so look out for that.\nSomething from the Disco Elyisum studio ZA/UM!\nAn espionage RPG, with a weird tone and the same incredible art style as its predecessor. Zero Parades is the name.\nA Neverness to Everness trailer here.\nWow this game looks absolutely stunning. It's one that I've been keeping my eyes on for awhile, so I'll definitely be pre-registering after the show.\nAnother game on my wishlist now!\nUnbeatable, an absolutely gorgeous rhythm adventure that's coming out on November 6 - yippee!\nHonor of Kings: World, a lovely looking spin-off based on the incredibly popular mobile MMO. It's more of an action-RPG, which is good news for me because I'm absolutely hopeless at MMOs.\nDelta Force is out right now on console!\nI was a big fan of this game back at its mobile launch, so I'll be checking out the PS5 release for sure.\nNow on to the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 live performance, which is the emotional song Alicia.\nAnd here's a photo of the performance live from the hall!\nTime for the first gameplay reveal of Cinder City, a shooter MMO set in a post-apocalyptic Seoul.\nI'm seeing lots of multiplayer battles and creepy zombie enemies. Ewww, that's some pretty nasty gore, too.\nSome absolutely wild looking game also from NCSoft now, starring heroes taken from across history battling it out in a really strange world.\nIt's all Time Takers, and I'm liking the look of the character designs.\nA fresh Silent Hill f trailer now, and wow it looks gorgeous!\nThe protagonist might be a young girl, but she seems to be pretty capable with a lead pipe as we see her bludgeoning all kinds of scary creatures.\nOn to a fresh game!\nI'm getting lots of soulslike vibes from the combat here, which has an armored protagonist going head to head with a mystical looking creature.\nIt's called La Divina Commedia, and is presumably something to do with the poem.\nCronos The New Dawn now, with a guy wearing the protagonist's suit on stage plus an all-new trailer showing off its lovely looking Poland setting and raft of horrifying enemies.\nNow it's time for something from Obsidian - The Outer Worlds 2 I suspect.\nNew The Outer Worlds 2 trailer\nAs predicted, it's a new trailer for The Outer Worlds 2 focusing predominantly on its companions.\nThere's a funny robot, a weird assassin, some strange cultist person, another funny robot, and a guy.\nAll bases are covered here, it seems.\nThe trailer also confirmed that you will NOT be able to sleep with any of the companions, and gave us an October 29 release date.\nInzoi Island Getaway on screen as I type this, a new free expansion for Inzoi.\nI didn't really like this game when it launched in early access earlier this year, but maybe this will be enough to get me to give it another shot.\nIt'll be out tomorrow, so I'll sleep on it before I decide.\nAnother anime game now, with guns! This is my kind of thing.\nIt's called Fate Trigger and will be playable in early 2026.\nAn online game based on the The Seven Deadly Sins anime now! I know absolutely nothing about the source material, so this one is a bit lost on me.\nA look at Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, followed by Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2. It's sequel extravaganza!\nThe latter also got a release date at long long last: 21 October 2025.\nAn Enshrouded expansion now - Enshrouded Wake of the Water set to come out in October. Good news for fans of the survival game, not such good news if, like me, you had never heard of it.\nAge of Empires 4 is coming to PS5! Complete with an all-new expansion.\nPre-order now, ahead of a November 4, 2025 release.\nNow here's something more up my street! A Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 expansion: Legacy of the Forge.\nWe've got some Cult of the Lamb news up! Is this going to be a free update, a sequel, or a new expansion? Let's see...\nThat's a \"massive paid expansion\" according to some on-screen text - that answers my question!\nIt's called Woolhaven and will be here in early 2026.\nWorld of Warcraft time!\nIt's time for a cinematic look at World of Warcraft: Midnight, the MMO's 11th expansion!\nThese cinematics are generally really high quality, so I'm looking forward to this.\nThere's been a noticeable lack of Resident Evil Requiem so far. Is something big from that game going to be the final reveal? It's definitely possible.\nA new project from Delta Force developers Team Jade! A tactical shooter this time, with an interesting horror skew.\nAnother title from the Wargaming, the World of Tanks devs.\nI'm seeing tanks, I'm seeing planes. Lots of explosions.\nThe official title is Heat!\nGhost of Yotei trailer time! With plenty of action from our protagonist Atsu and another look at the stunning open-world setting.\nThe combat still looks absolutely fantastic, and the colors on some of these scenes are gorgeous.\nWe've also just had out look at Ghost of Yotei Legends - a free multiplayer DLC that will come later in 2026! That's pretty cool.\nOkay, it's Resident Evil time...\nThe trailer is all about protagonist Grace Ashcroft and has confirmed that her mother Alyssa Ashcroft from Resident Evil Outbreak is going to be in the game!\nIt looks like we're seeing the hotel where parts of the game are set, presumably some time before her mother's death.\nWell, that guy is very dead.\nIt's almost over, with just one last surprise to go! A \"global announcement\" of some kind?\nA Game Science release! That's the Black Myth: Wukong developers. I suspect we're about to see another soulslike...\nWe've got two guys with comedy British accents on screen, plus a massive tiger. What could this be?\nIt's Black Myth: Zhong Kui! It'll be another single-player action RPG based on another part of Chinese mythology.\nIt's over!\nWhat did you think of the show?\nI thought it was pretty underwhelming, if I'm being honest."

Buying a Nintendo Switch 2 gives you access to a whole new generation of Nintendo titles.\n\u2705 You value performance: The Nintendo Switch 2 is Nintendo's highest power handheld to date. It delivers decent frame rates in demanding games like Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition and Hitman World of Assassination \u2013 Signature Edition.\n\u274c You need something super portable: The Nintendo Switch 2 is much larger than the original Nintendo Switch and even the Nintendo Switch OLED. If you're after a system that you can easily stash in a bag, the Nintendo Switch Lite is still the way to go.\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 offers a suite of significant upgrades compared to the original Nintendo Switch. With support for 4K and 1440p resolution output in its docked mode or 1080p at up to 120Hz in handheld mode, Nintendo games have never looked better.\nIts 7.9 inch screen is spacious and, although it is only an LCD panel, impressively bright and vivid. It also boasts the upgraded Joy-Con 2 controllers, which are larger and more comfortable than the ones on its predecessor. Innovative new features, like the Joy-Con 2 mouse mode also introduce exciting, novel ways to interact with games and are the perfect fit for the likes of Sid Meier's Civilization 7.\nIn addition to a growing library of fantastic Nintendo Switch 2 exclusives, such as Mario Kart World, the system has brilliant backwards compatibility. Certain titles like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom benefit from paid Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrades that increase the framerate, while others are naturally improved by the upgraded specs. Expect shorter loading times, and more stable framerates in games like Bayonetta 3, which really struggled on the original Switch.\nThe only major downside of the Nintendo Switch 2 is its battery life, which has taken a big hit. Nintendo claims that it lasts between 2 and 6.5 hours, though in my testing I have never been able to achieve that latter figure. I often find it running out of juice in about two and half hours, which has been a problem when I've tried to use it on long journies.\n- Read more: Nintendo Switch 2 review\nThe best budget handheld games console\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're shopping for kids: The Nintendo Switch Lite is made of thick and durable plastic which is hard to damage. The fact the Joy-Cons are built-in also means they cannot be lost easily.\n\u2705 You're on a tight budget: The Nintendo Switch Lite is considerably cheaper than both the Nintendo Switch OLED and the original Nintendo Switch. Best of all, it plays all the same games.\n\u274c You might play docked: Although portable play is the focus here, it is worth noting that the Switch Lite cannot be played on a TV like other models. Only buy this if you're sure you want to play in handheld mode all of the time.\nWith its affordable asking price of $199.99 / \u00a3200, the Nintendo Switch Lite is our top pick for those who are shopping on a budget. Its smaller form factor is perfect for portable play as it can be quickly shoved into a rucksack or even a large pocket when you're on the move. There are also a range of attractive bright colors to choose from including blue, pink, purple, grey, and yellow.\nThe design is constructed out of a thick plastic and, in our testing, proved more durable than the original Nintendo Switch model which is ideal if you're prone to dropping or scratching your systems. I took a Nintendo Switch Lite with me to the office every day in a small case in my rucksack and it looked practically good as new after about a year of ownership. Furthermore, the fact that the controllers are permanently attached to the system has the added benefit that they are impossible to lose while out and about.\nYou're getting a slightly smaller screen here, but it runs at the same 720p resolution as the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch OLED, so there is no performance or visual downgrade. If anything, I think that the smaller size can help the image look a little sharper but most will likely not notice this.\nSo far, I've particularly enjoyed diving into retro fighting games like Ultra Street Fighter 2: The Final Challengers and Darkstalkers plus Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo from the excellent Capcom Fighting Collection - which lend themselves well to bursts of portable play. The one limitation of the Nintendo Switch Lite, however, is its complete inability to dock and play games on a TV when you're at home, so definitely bear this in mind before you buy.\n- Read more: Nintendo Switch Lite review\nThe best handheld games console for PC gamers\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want your Steam library on the go: The Steam Deck OLED is the best way to play your Steam library out of the house, at home on the couch, or in bed. We don't recommend playing it in the bath, though, for obvious reasons.\n\u2705 You want something cheaper than a gaming laptop: Even the top-end Steam Deck OLED comes in cheaper than most gaming laptops, making it a more accessible and affordable way to get into portable PC gaming.\n\u274c You want something more compact: The sheer size of the Steam Deck OLED can make it annoying to lug around. Consider an alternative like the Nintendo Switch OLED if you want something much smaller with a similarly good display.\nA powerful, portable gaming PC that can fit in your pocket is certainly an attractive proposition. While it can't really fit in your pocket thanks to its absolutely gigantic size, the Steam Deck OLED does offer all of the power of a respectable gaming laptop in a much smaller package.\nIt's available directly through Valve's Steam client and, regardless of the version you go for, can run most Steam Deck Verified titles like Cyberpunk 2077 and Apex Legends smoothly. That said, I have found that certain recent titles do run badly - such as Deathloop. This isn't a dealbreaker, but is worth bearing in mind as you stack the Steam Deck OLED up against the competition.\nBecause this device is powered by a modified version of the Linux operating system, not every game from your Steam library will work either. That's not to say that there is a good chance that a sizeable chunk of titles you already own will be compatible straight out of the box.\nOne of the other issues with Valve's handheld that was revealed in my testing was the fact that it battery life can really struggle with more intensive games. I found that something like God of War really pushed the system to its limit, lasting for just about two hours on standard settings while not plugged in. Given just how well many of the most demanding titles look and run on this device, though, this is a trade-off that I think is well worth making.\n- Read more: Steam Deck OLED review\nThe best handheld games console for retro gaming\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to play Evercade games on a budget: With its extremely affordable price point, the Super Pocket is easily the cheapest way to play the wide library of Evercade games.\n\u2705 You want a small system: When it comes to size, few proper handheld games consoles are more portable than the Super Pocket.\n\u274c You want something bigger: If you're in the market for something larger, consider the other options on this list. The small size of the Super Pocket could make it a pain for those with bigger hands or poor eyesight.\nThe Super Pocket performs impressively well while playing older titles which makes it our top pick if you want a handheld console for playing retro games. There are currently four versions of the handheld console on the market: the green and black Taito Edition, the yellow and blue Capcom Edition, the blue and white Technos Edition, and the red and black Atari Edition.\nAll versions include a unique built-in library of titles, focusing specifically on popular games from their respective publishers. I absolutely adore Space Invaders and Bubble Bobble from the Taito Edition in particular, but also have a big soft spot for Street Fighter 2: Hyper Fighting, Final Fight, and the original Mega Man on the Capcom Edition. As for the other two models, River City Ransom on the Technos Edition remains an absolute banger while I have enjoyed my time with arcade classics like Asteroids and Centipede on the Atari version.\nI have played all of the games across each library during my testing and have been hugely pleased with the smooth performance given the cheap price and small form factor. The 320x240px IPS screen is certainly going to pale in comparison to the far more premium displays found on others systems on this list, like the Nintendo Switch OLED\u2019s much higher resolution 720p display, but it's balanced out thanks to its 2.8\u201d (~7cm) size.\nOn the whole, games look fantastic and boast deep colors. There are even some decent display options (such CRT scanline filters and aspect ratios) that allow you to further to tweak their look to your liking in the software.\nEasily one of the most desirable features of the Super Pocket, however, is the Evercade cartridge slot. This grants Super Pocket owners access to a growing library of affordable Evercade cartridges that can pack everything from classic Namco arcade games to modern indie titles like Micro Mages and Foxyland.\n- Read more: Super Pocket review\nThe best handheld games console for remote play\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want another way to play your PS5 games: The PlayStation Portal lets you enjoy your PS5 without the need for a TV, offering a brilliant way to get more game time. This is perfect for when someone else is using the TV or when you want to game in another room.\n\u2705 You want an ergonomic handheld: Having been designed around an established controller, the PlayStation Portal is one of the most comfortable handhelds right now. It has all the features of a DualSense controller and is also incredible from an accessibility perspective as a result.\n\u274c You want a device that can play games natively: The PlayStation Portal is only for streaming from your PS5 over the internet - if you don't own a PS5 or are looking for something to play games natively (or stream from the cloud) then it is not for you.\nThe PlayStation Portal is a brilliant companion device for the PlayStation 5. It enables PS5 owners to access their games remotely by streaming them over Wi-Fi (or a tethered mobile connection), beautifully translating big-screen games on its small and portable screen.\nWhat makes the Portal really shine is its slick design and varied feature set. This is effectively a PS5 DualSense controller with an 8-inch LCD screen squeezing into the middle. It maintaining the ergonomics, design, and features of the controller, sitting in your hands very comfortably and is easy to use if you're used to the layout. I'm also a huge fan of the excellent haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.\nThe screen is punchy and vibrant while the speakers are more than enough for most games. The downsides here are very minor and only extend to an irksome lack of Bluetooth support and the very slow battery charging speed.\nWhile it's not a handheld console by way of playing games natively (or streaming from the cloud), it superbly serves a very specific niche - which is to provide PS5 players with another way to play their PS5 remotely.\nI've especially enjoyed my time playing PlayStation exclusives like The Last of Us Part 2 and Spider-Man 2 away from my TV, but have also spent plenty of time with A Plague Tale: Requiem, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.\n- Read more: PlayStation Portal review\nAlso tested...\nHere are some of the handheld gaming console that we've tested, but didn't make the final cut.\nNintendo Switch OLED\nThe previous king of this guide, the Nintendo Switch OLED is still a solid option in 2025. It's been superseded by the higher power Nintendo Switch 2, but could still be worth it on sale.\nFor more information, check out our full Nintendo Switch OLED review\nNintendo Switch\nIt's the same story as the Nintendo Switch OLED here. The Nintendo Switch has been outclassed by the Nintendo Switch 2, but its age does mean that it can be found on sale and is regularly part of killer bundle deals - so keep an eye out for those.\nFor more information, check out our full Nintendo Switch review\nAsus ROG Ally X\nIf you have a generous budget and want a more premium alternative to the Steam Deck OLED, then this could be a good pick. It's powerful, with better battery life and Windows 11 support, but the high price tag holds it back from a more prominent position in this guide.\nFor more information, check out our full Asus ROG Ally X review\nLenovo Legion Go\nAnother Steam Deck rival to consider is the Lenovo Legion Go, which we awarded a glowing four and a half stars. Useful additions like a built-in kickstand and improved performance make it a worthy contender, but it does suffer from some poorly-designed software.\nFor more information, check out our full Lenovo Legion Go review\nSteam Deck\nThe older Steam Deck model can still be picked up on the second hand market. Although the Steam Deck OLED is the way to go if you're buying new, this is a good choice if you want to save cash by buying used.\nFor more information, check out our full Steam Deck review\nLogitech G Cloud\nThe Logitech G Cloud is extremely niche, but it still has quite a dedicated audience. If you want a handheld designed for streaming and nothing else, then it might be worth keeping in mind.\nFor more information, check out our full Steam Deck review\nRazer Edge\nThis Android handheld positions itself as a portable gaming machine, but falls a little short of that promise thanks to a sky-high price tag and inconsistent battery life.\nFor more information, check out our full Razer Edge review\nEvercade EXP\nA good, but more expensive option for retro gamers compared to our number one choice, the Super Pocket. If you want a slightly bigger handheld with a much larger display, this could be the one for you.\nFor more information, check out our full Evercade EXP review\nHow to choose a gaming handheld\nThe easiest way to choose a gaming handheld is to think about the kinds of games that you would want to use it to play. If you\u2019re interested in playing Nintendo published titles on the go, like Super Mario Odyssey or Mario Kart 8, then you\u2019re going to need to choose the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch OLED, or Nintendo Switch Lite as these are the only platforms where such games are available.\nLikewise, if you want access to the latest PlayStation games and already own a PS5 with an expansive library, the PlayStation Portal is going to be your best bet. Do bear in mind, however, that the PlayStation Portal is a streaming-only device that requires a constant internet connection. If you need a device that can be played offline, consider other options.\nIf you want to play more PC-oriented games such as Valheim or Baldur's Gate 3 then a portable PC such as the Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED is going to be the best choice. You should also look at a Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED if you\u2019re most concerned about performance, as it features dramatically higher specs than the Nintendo Switch while maintaining a similar portable form factor.\nWhile all of the options on this list are able to play retro titles in some capacity, a dedicated retro handheld such as the Super Pocket could be the perfect option if you\u2019re more concerned with playing older games and don\u2019t want to break the bank. The Super Pocket offers an incredibly portable way to play retro games on the go, with a robust in-built library of titles right out of the box. It's also compatible with Evercade cartridges, allowing you to experience even more games down the line.\nBest handheld games console - FAQs\nDo handheld games consoles make good gifts?\nYes, handheld games consoles make great gifts. The reasons for this are simple. Firstly, many handheld games consoles are all-in-one machines that don't require a TV or any external controllers to play. This makes them super convenient and means that you don't have to worry about potential compatibility issues with certain displays. They can also be played in any environment, even out and about.\nHandheld games consoles also appeal to a wide range of ages. Systems like the Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck have libraries with a huge variety all designed for different age groups. Handheld consoles are also a good pick for younger children, as they are simpler to setup and use than home consoles while also often coming in much cheaper on the whole.\nIs the Nintendo Switch better in docked or handheld mode?\nYour experience with the Nintendo Switch will largely come down to personal preference. If you're out and about a lot, then handheld mode may be the way forward with the console. Even so, having the flexibility to play docked when you're at home can be a great added bonus. Obviously, with a Nintendo Switch Lite, you won't have the flexibility to enjoy the console docked, but you can still enjoy the same great games.\nAre handheld games consoles more affordable?\nHandheld consoles are fantastic if you're looking to save money and still get a high-quality gaming experience, but that doesn't always mean they are cheaper than a home console. If you're on a strict budget, the Nintendo Switch Lite or the Super Pocket are very budget-friendly. If you're after more powerful hardware, however, the price will start to climb and you may end up paying a similar figure for a handheld as you would for a home console like the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X.\nWhat's the best handheld console for kids?\nIf you're looking specifically for a dedicated handheld machine for kids, the Nintendo Switch Lite is a great option. Its small size and robust design is very well suited to little hands. It also lacks the ability to remove the controllers, meaning there are fewer things to break or lose.\nCan I play the PlayStation Portal without a PS5?\nNo, you cannot play games on the PlayStation Portal without a PS5. That said, there is currently a cloud streaming option in beta for PlayStation Plus members that allows you to stream games directly to the handheld from Sony's servers without the need for a console. This suggests that the feature could see a wider release in future and make the PS Portal more capable in that regard.\nHow we test the best handheld games consoles\nEach of the handheld consoles on this list has been tested rigorously by a member of the TechRadar team. Our testing takes into account factors like the system's price and any unique features. We also test a range of games and software that suit the handheld in question. For example, we tested the PlayStation Portal with a range of popular PS5 titles including Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Helldivers 2, and The Last of Us Part 2. For the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite, we tested top Nintendo Switch games including Mario Kart 8 and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom in addition to a range of graphically demanding ports such as The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Xcom 2.\nWhile testing the Steam Deck, we assessed its performance and compatibility with a wide a range of Steam Deck Verified games from indie hits like Hades and Hotline Miami to huge adventures such as God of War. When it comes to the Super Pocket, we tested the built-in library in addition to an Evercade cartridge featuring games such as Burger Time and Sly Spy.\nTo take the example of Nintendo Switch OLED and Nintendo Switch Lite, that involved playing some of the most recent Nintendo Switch games in portable mode. In the case of handheld PCs like the Steam Deck, rigorous testing of our Steam library was involved including tests to determine how compatible popular titles were and how well they ran on the handheld.\nTested by\nEach of the products included in this guide was extensively tested by one of our expert reviewers.\nRob is TechRadar Gaming's Managing Editor.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Asus ROG Ally X is one of the most powerful gaming handhelds yet, and puts the Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch to shame performance-wise. However, you're paying for this extra firepower with a hefty price tag, and Windows 11 remains frustrating to use in the handheld form factor.\nPros\n- +\nPowerful\n- +\nImproved battery life\n- +\nSolid design\nCons\n- -\nVery expensive\n- -\nCan't compete with gaming laptops of the same price\n- -\nWindows 11 continues to hobble handhelds\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nAsus ROG Ally X: Two-minute review\nThe Asus ROG Ally X is the surprise follow-up to the ROG Ally, and is the latest entry in the increasingly-competitive handheld gaming PC market.\nSince Valve fired the starting gun on this latest arms race with the excellent Steam Deck, various gaming laptop makers have been keen to release their own handhelds, with the likes of MSI and Zotac releasing, or planning to release, their own takes on the form factor.\nArguably the breakout star of this new breed of device was the original ROG Ally, which was launched in 2023. Less than a year later, Asus surprised us all by releasing a follow-up, the ROG Ally X.\nReleasing a new version so soon after the original is an interesting move, and suggests that Asus is following a gaming laptop-like release schedule, upgrading its devices every 12 months or so with the latest components. While this does make some sense \u2013 it works for gaming laptops to ensure they maintain a performance edge \u2013 it\u2019s also risky, as you might alienate customers who bought your earlier model, and it also means that upgrades deliver less-impressive performance improvements.\nWhile yearly updates are commonplace for laptops, it\u2019s a different story when it comes to handheld PCs and consoles. Since the Steam Deck launched in early 2022 there's only been one new model, the Steam Deck OLED, which launched over a year later and which, outside of a much-improved screen, remained largely unchanged hardware-wise.\nMeanwhile, the Nintendo Switch, arguably the device that has had the biggest influence on these new handhelds, has also only seen a few small changes to the hardware, apart from the cheaper Switch Lite, and a model with an improved OLED screen. The highly-anticipated Switch 2 has still not been officially announced by Nintendo, seven years after the original launched.\nSo, when the ROG Ally X was first announced, many people assumed that this was a brand-new version of the handheld due to the name. The reality, however, is that the Ally X is more of an iterative upgrade, more akin to what we\u2019ve seen from its competitors. So, if you\u2019re new to the Ally ecosystem, you\u2019re getting a handheld with some of the most powerful mobile hardware out there. But, if you own the original ROG Ally, it could be hard to justify buying the new model.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAs for what\u2019s changed under the hood, the Ally X comes with a larger 80Whr battery (compared to the 40Whr battery of the original), a doubling of SSD storage to 1TB, and a RAM boost from 16GB to 24GB (and it also gets a speed boost).\nThere have also been tweaks to the design, with a new black look with rounder edges for a more comfortable feel in hand, more reliable and responsive joysticks, D-Pad and face buttons, improved speakers, and an additional USB Type-C port (making two in total, with the new port supporting USB4).\nAlong with the larger battery, the ROG Ally X now supports up to 100W charging speeds. This is up from the 65W of the original, and should mean recharging times are similar, if not a bit faster. However, it should be noted that the ROG Ally X comes with the same 65W charger as its predecessor \u2013 you\u2019ll need to invest in a faster charger, such as Asus\u2019 ROG 140W GaN Charger, to get the benefit.\nThese changes come at a cost design-wise, with the thickness increasing by 4.5mm and weight by over 11%. While this doesn\u2019t result in a huge impact on the overall portability of the handheld, it\u2019s worth bearing in mind if you already felt the original Ally was a little unwieldly.\nWhile these changes suggest that the ROG Ally X is a decent step up from the original, two of the most important components that affect performance remain unchanged. You still get the AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip, and the screen remains a 7-inch 1080p 120Hz affair with 500 nits brightness.\nThis means that gaming performance \u2013 which will be the biggest consideration for most people, especially owners of the original Ally \u2013 will remain largely the same, so if you want a generational leap you might want to hold out for the Ally 2, or whatever ROG's next handheld ends up being called. Instead, think of the ROG Ally X as a refinement on an already impressive bit of gaming kit.\nWhen it comes to the price, however, there is a leap, with the ROG Ally X going for $799.99 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,599. This is more expensive than the original, which launched with a base model that cost $499.99, and a more powerful model with the same Z1 Extreme chip as the Ally X for $699.99.\nNot only does the ROG Ally X need to justify the $100 price increase, but Asus is continuing to sell the original ROG Ally models at lower prices, which makes pitching the Ally X to gamers all the more difficult.\nAsus ROG Ally X: Price & availability\n- How much does it cost? $799.99 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,599\n- When is it available? Available now\n- Where can you get it? Available in the US, UK, and Australia\nThe ROG Ally X is now available globally, though in the US and Canada, it's exclusive to the Asus online shop and Best Buy. Unlike the original, of which there were two models, there's only one Ally X model, and it costs $799.99 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,599.\nThis is a jump from the $699 / \u00a3699 that the high-end version of the original launched at. For a gaming handheld, this is an extremely high price, putting the ROG Ally X in budget gaming laptop territory.\nOne of the best things about the Steam Deck is that it launched at a very affordable price, with the base model selling for $399 / \u00a3349, and even the high-end model going for $649 / \u00a3569 \u2013 well below the asking price of the ROG Ally X.\nOf course, the ROG Ally X has much more impressive specs than the now two-year-old Steam Deck, but the fact that Valve\u2019s handheld launched at a price that no gaming laptop could match (no gaming laptop that\u2019s worth buying, at least), meant it was the best option by far for PC gamers wanting to play their games on the go for an affordable price.\nHowever, for the price Asus is asking for the ROG Ally X, there are numerous budget gaming laptops that are worth buying \u2013 and while they don\u2019t offer the same level of portability, they offer much better gaming performance thanks to more powerful discrete graphics cards.\nThis puts the ROG Ally X in a bit of a strange position. If you want the most affordable way to play PC games on a portable device, then the Steam Deck remains a solid choice \u2013 and even the original ROG Ally now offers better value for money. And, if you just want the best portable gaming system, the best gaming laptops are the way to go.\nBut if you want a handheld form factor that offers the best game performance, the ROG Ally X could be right up your street.\n- Value: 3 / 5\nAsus ROG Ally X: Specs\nUnlike the original Asus ROG Ally, the ROG Ally X only has one specs configuration.\n| Component | Spec |\n|---|---|\n| Display | 7-inch FHD (1920 x 1080), 120Hz, 500 nits |\n| CPU | AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme |\n| Graphics | AMD Radeon Graphics |\n| RAM | 24GB LPDDR5X-7500 |\n| Storage | 1TB M.2 2280 SSD |\n| Port selection | 2x USB Type-C ports, 1x combo jack, 1x SD card reader slot |\n| Weight | 678g |\n| Dimensions | 280.2 x 114 x 36.9mm (WxDxH) |\nAsus ROG Ally X: Design\n- New design with improved buttons\n- Premium look and feel\n- Comfortable to hold, but big for a handheld\nThe design of the ROG Ally X might feel familiar, even if you haven\u2019t owned an Ally device before. With a thumb stick either side of the 7-inch screen, along with a D-Pad on the left and four face buttons (matching the Xbox controller) on the right, the ROG Ally X looks a lot like a Nintendo Switch Lite \u2013 and in the new black color scheme it resembles the Steam Deck far more than the white original.\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing \u2013 this is a form factor which has been proven to work well for handheld consoles (one could argue that it can be traced back to Sega\u2019s Game Gear from the 1990s), and the Xbox button layout means any PC game designed with controllers in mind should play well, with no button mapping required.\nThere are, though, some key differences in the design that make the ROG Ally X stand out. Unlike on the Steam Deck, there are no touchpads on each side of the screen. On the Steam Deck, these are designed to simulate mouse control for games, although outside of a few point-and-click games I rarely used them when playing, so the fact that the ROG Ally X doesn\u2019t come with them is no big loss. If you prefer playing with a mouse and keyboard you can use the ROG Ally X in dock mode by connecting it up to a USB-C hub, or go with a gaming laptop or desktop PC.\nAnother more unique design element is the inclusion of RGB lighting around both thumb sticks \u2013 which can be customized through the ROG Armoury Crate software \u2013and the lights can be synched to other Asus products. It gives the ROG Ally X a premium look, and as we all know, gamers love RGB lighting. One thing I did notice, however, was that sometimes when charging the device the lights would pulse, which can be a bit distracting.\nAs well as the more noticeable design changes compared to the earlier model, there are some more subtle changes as well. There\u2019s an additional USB-C port, which supports USB4 speeds, and the thumbsticks and D-Pad have been improved. There\u2019s more resistance to the thumbsticks, which helps give you a feeling of greater control, and the buttons on the back of the device have been made smaller to reduce accidental presses. This is a welcome change, as I found when using the Steam Deck that I\u2019d often hit those buttons by mistake. The body of the ROG Ally X has also been given more rounded corners and edges, which makes it more comfortable to hold.\nThere are four buttons for launching software and menus, a microSD slot for expanding storage (which is nice to have, but arguably less important thanks to the SSD storage being doubled to a roomy 1TB), an audio jack, and a power button with a built-in fingerprint scanner. This last feature is one of my favorite things, as it lets you log in with just a touch of the button, and it's something the Steam Deck lacks. On the Steam Deck, you have to log in using the onscreen keyboard, and once you've logged in there\u2019s no additional security step required when waking the device. While this is more convenient than having to log in with a password every time you pick up the Steam Deck, it\u2019s also a security risk if it gets stolen or lost. The fingerprint scanner of the Ally X is a nice solution to those issues.\nOverall, the design of the ROG Ally X isn\u2019t revolutionary, but it is a refinement. It takes a popular-for-a-reason handheld form factor and makes improvements in almost every aspect, except for size and weight. Anyone who's\u2026 er\u2026 switching from a Switch, with its dimensions of 9.41 x 4.02 x 0.55 inches / 239 x 102mm x 14mm and a weight of 0.93lbs / 422g, might be shocked picking up the ROG Ally X with its dimensions of 11.02 x 4.37 x 0.97 inches / 280.2 x 114 x 37mm, and weight of 1.5lbs / 678g.\nIt\u2019s also bigger and heavier than the original ROG Ally, and around the same size and weight as the original Steam Deck.\n- Design: 4 / 5\nAsus ROG Ally X: Performance\n- Same AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip as original model\n- Good gaming performance for a handheld\n- Windows 11 is still a pain\nHere is how the Asus ROG Ally X performed in our suite of benchmark tests:\n3DMark Port Royal: 1,685; Fire Strike: 7,680; Time Spy: 3,336\nGeekBench 6.3: 2,544 (single-core); 11,255 (multi-core)\n25GB File Copy: 19.1 seconds\nF1 23 1080p (Ultra) 7fps\nCyberpunk 2077: 1080p (Ultra) 4.94fps\nWeb Surfing (Battery Informant): 8:19:08 hours\nPCMark 10 Battery Life (Gaming): 3:04 hours\nHardware-wise, there\u2019s little to fault with the ROG Ally X. The AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip is the same one that's found in the high-end model of the original Ally X (as well as its competitor the Lenovo Legion).\nThe chip has been designed by AMD, a company with a long history of making gaming components for both PCs and consoles, especially for handheld gaming PCs, and features an 8-core, 16-thread CPU with a base clock of 3.3 GHz and a boost of 5.1 GHz, as well as a 12-core RDNA 3 GPU. Technical jargon aside, this is a very capable gaming device that puts the Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch to shame when it comes to sheer firepower.\nThe chip also allows the ROG Ally X to make use of some handy AMD features such as AMD Radeon Super Resolution, which upscales graphics for improved performance, and AMD Radeon Boost, which adjusts the resolution in supported games on the fly to keep performance fast and consistent.\nThe ROG Ally X also offers a range of power settings, called \u2018Operating Mode\u2019, which you can quickly switch to depending on what you\u2019re playing. Silent mode lowers the performance of the handheld, which prolongs battery life and means the fans don\u2019t kick in quite so much \u2013 making it an ideal mode for when you're playing less demanding indie games while out and about \u2013 and Performance mode balances performance and efficiency for smoother gameplay, but at the expense of battery life.\nThere\u2019s also Turbo mode, which prioritizes performance. This is the setting you\u2019ll want if you\u2019re playing graphically-intensive games and want the highest possible frame rates. This will mean the battery gets depleted much more quickly, but if you play with the Ally X plugged in you get an additional performance bump. The ROG Ally X automatically switches to Turbo mode when you plug it in, which is a nice touch.\nGaming performance is very good, as long as you keep your expectations in check. With graphical settings on high, Ghost of Tsushima: Director\u2019s Cut ran at a solid 30fps with default settings. Considering that this is a large open-world game with great visuals, I was very impressed, though this was with the Ally X plugged in and using Turbo mode. I tweaked some settings, including adding frame generation and setting adaptive resolution to target 60fps, and I found that while the game would run mostly at 60fps the frame rates were a lot less stable, with some noticeable drops. Graphics quality was also drastically lowered (due to the Ally X attempting to hit the higher frame rate), with distracting visual artifacts being added, especially during fast-moving scenes and with fog and cloud effects.\nAt 30fps the game is playable and fun \u2013 and while it\u2019s a noticeable step down from how I play it on my usual gaming PC at 4K resolution and 120Hz, it\u2019s certainly impressive that you\u2019re able to play the game on a handheld device. After adjusting to playing at the lower frame rate, I was able to successfully fight off hordes of Mongols \u2013 considering how Ghost of Tsushima\u2019s combat requires careful timing for parries and blocking, the frame rate compromise doesn\u2019t impact too much on the playability of the game.\nPlaying less demanding indie games such as Balatro (a current obsession), is a joy, while the Hades 2 beta looks and plays brilliantly.\nFor extremely demanding games, however, the ROG Ally X is still going to struggle. Cyberpunk 2077 at the highest settings can only manage single-digit frames per seconds scores, so you\u2019ll need to do some serious tweaking to the graphics settings to bump up the frame rates. While the 1080p 120Hz, screen looks lovely, there aren\u2019t many modern AAA games that\u2019ll take advantage of it, though older games should be able to go beyond 60fps at full HD resolution.\nAs the ROG Ally X is a gaming PC at heart, it does mean you can tweak graphical settings to get better performance; this is something PC gamers are used to, but console gamers may feel less comfortable with. It's well worth doing, however, as the results can be impressive. At default settings, Cyberpunk 2077 hits around eight to nine fps, making it unplayable. However, by turning down the graphics settings and enabling AMD FSR 2.1 upscaling on Performance mode, I was able to get it running at 60fps on the Ally X (while plugged in). This is very impressive, as while the graphics take a big hit quality-wise, you're still playing a complex and large game on a handheld. For gamers who grew up with the Gameboy, this is an excellent example of how technology has evolved over the years.\nWhile the hardware side of things is hard to fault, software-wise there are some more annoying niggles \u2013 although a lot of this isn\u2019t down to Asus. While I\u2019m not a huge fan of its Armory Crate software on its gaming laptops, it does a decent job of providing a handheld-friendly interface for launching games, and the ability to change the aforementioned performance modes on the fly is very useful \u2013 as is the information overlay that can be enabled to show you frame rates, component temperatures and more. You can move the overlay by dragging and dropping it with your finger so that it doesn\u2019t obscure important UI features in a game, which is a nice touch.\nSystem updates are applied through Armory Crate, which does simplify things, but it\u2019s not as easy as updating the Switch or Steam Deck. Those devices let you know when there\u2019s an update available, and you download and install the update and you\u2019re done. With the Ally X you need to install several smaller updates rather than one larger one, with some needing to be installed one at time, and some requiring the handheld to be restarted. I was also prompted to install a BIOS update, which might alarm console-first gamers, though PC gamers will be more accustomed to this way of doing things.\nLike the original ROG Ally and most of its competitors \u2013 bar the Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch \u2013 the ROG Ally X runs on Windows 11, and this brings mixed results.\nTo put it bluntly: Windows 11 is an operating system designed for desktop PCs and laptops, and it remains poorly suited to gaming handhelds. While Asus has tried to mitigate this by having the full-screen Armoury Crate software load when Windows 11 starts, there are many instances where you have to grapple with Windows 11\u2019s interface (such as having to dismiss pop-ups and error messages), and this can be tricky when using the 7-inch touchscreen of the ROG Ally X \u2013 you end up trying to jab small buttons in frustration.\nSometimes Windows 11 encounters issues that cause a game to crash, and waking up the ROG Ally X is a frustrating lottery \u2013 sometimes your game resumes right where you were, as is the case with the Switch and Steam Deck, but other times you\u2019re dropped onto the Windows 11 desktop. You should be able to get back into the game by tapping the taskbar, expanding it and tapping on the (far too small) icon of the running game, but it\u2019s fiddly, and detracts from the easy and convenient console-like experience Asus is going for.\nTo be fair, these are issues that are due to Windows 11 being unsuitable for a handheld, and there\u2019s not much Asus can do about that \u2013 and these are problems that affect other Windows-based gaming handhelds. However, it does go to show how wise Valve was when creating the Steam Deck to create its own Linux-based operating system, SteamOS, which has been designed specifically for the handheld. This has delivered a much more satisfying user experience, and thanks to the Proton tool, Windows-only games are able to run on Linux without any noticeable impact on performance. If Asus created its own Linux distro specifically for the ROG Ally X, the overall user experience of the handheld could be greatly improved.\nUsing Windows 11 does have its benefits, however. For a start, it means that all games \u2013 and applications \u2013 you run on the ROG Ally X can run natively, rather than using a compatibility layer like Proton, so any performance impact, no matter how minor, is avoided.\nIt gives you a far greater degree of flexibility as well, especially if you use the ROG Ally X with a USB dock, as it effectively turns the handheld into a full Windows 11 desktop PC. While you can also do this with the Steam Deck, Linux has a steeper learning curve, and not every app is available for the open-source operating system.\nThe ROG Ally X also supports games from every major game store \u2013 unlike the Steam Deck, which limits you to playing games bought on Steam. While Steam is by far the most-used game store on PC, which means you\u2019ll likely be launching Steam games on the ROG Ally X regularly, it\u2019s also great to be able to run games from the Epic Games Store, GOG, and more without having to resort to installing third-party tools. If you have a wide selection of the best PC games across numerous libraries, not just Steam, then the ROG Ally X is definitely worth considering, and that flexibility makes a lot of the Windows 11 annoyances worth putting up with.\nOverall, the ROG Ally X offers impressive gaming performance thanks to cutting-edge mobile components, but you\u2019re always going to hit a wall when using an integrated GPU rather than having a dedicated graphics card, and that means you won\u2019t get the same level of performance you\u2019d get from a gaming laptop or desktop PC at this price \u2013 but that\u2019s the trade-off for the portable handheld form factor.\nWindows 11 continues to be a pain for handhelds, but Asus has tried its best to get around a lot of the issues with its Armory Crate software, and while it means you get a sometimes wonky experience that doesn\u2019t feel as consistent what you'll get on the Steam Deck or Nintendo Switch, the ability to play games from pretty much any store, rather than being tied to one, will be a big plus.\nIf Microsoft ever does release a version of Windows that\u2019s optimized for handheld PCs (maybe alongside the much-rumored handheld Xbox), then the Ally X will be a much more enjoyable device to use.\n- Performance: 3.5 / 5\nAsus ROG Ally X: Battery life\n- Improved battery life\n- Good for around three hours of intensive gaming\nBecause of their small form factor, gaming handhelds like the ROG Ally X will never offer exceptional battery life, especially when playing demanding games, but the increased size of the battery (80Whr vs 40Whr of the originally Ally) is certainly welcome.\nIn my day-to-day gaming with the Ally X I was pleased with how long the battery lasted. Admittedly, a lot of my time was spent playing the rather undemanding Balatro, but I did also complete a few missions in Ghost of Tsushima. Unlike my trusty, yet aging, Steam Deck, I was able to play for hours on end without being warned of a low battery. It might be due to its age, but my Steam Deck seems to need charging every time I pick it up.\nIn our battery-life benchmark tests, the ROG Ally X lasted over eight hours with the Battery Informant web-browsing test, and while that\u2019s certainly impressive, you\u2019re not going to be doing much web browsing on this handheld. The far more representative PC Mark 10 gaming benchmark resulted in the battery lasting just over three hours, which is the closer to the kind of battery life you\u2019ll experience when using the Ally X for the main task it was designed for: gaming. I found that between three to five hours of solid gaming is a realistic expectation, depending on the games you play.\nThis may be a disappointment for console gamers, but for anyone who's used a gaming laptop in the past, this won\u2019t be too surprising. Playing games uses a lot of energy, and that means batteries can get depleted quickly.\n- Battery Life: 4 / 5\nShould you buy the Asus ROG Ally X?\n| Value | Priced at $800, this is an extremely expensive handheld that many will find hard to justify. | 3 / 5 |\n| Design | Asus has improved almost every aspect of the Ally X's design, leading to a solid and premium-feeling product. | 4 / 5 |\n| Performance | This is the best performing handheld you can get - but it still can't compete with a gaming laptop. | 3.5 / 5 |\n| Battery Life | Battery life is very good for a handheld thanks to a new, larger, battery. | 4 / 5 |\n| Total | The Asus ROG Ally X is a very impressive handheld - but its high price means you may be better off getting a gaming laptop instead. | 4 / 5 |\nBuy the Asus ROG Ally X if...\nYou want a powerful handheld gaming PC\nAsus has packed the ROG Ally X with some very impressive specs, giving you arguably the best handheld experience money can buy.\nYou don\u2019t just buy games through Steam\nThe ROG Ally X lets you run games from various services, including Steam, Epic Games Store and the Microsoft Store, which is great for people who have lots of different game libraries.\nYou\u2019re into indie games\nWhile the ROG Ally X can run AAA games, it really excels at indie games which prioritize gameplay and artistry over pure graphical excess, which allows them to make full use of the\nimpressive 1080p screen.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou want a console-like experience\nWhile the Armory Crate software does a decent job of giving you a handheld-optimized interface to launch your games on, Windows 11 still causes some issues.\nYou\u2019re on a budget\nThe high price tag means this is one of the most expensive handhelds you can buy \u2013 there are more affordable alternatives out there.\nYou want maximum performance\nWhile the Ally X is the most powerful handheld out there, it still pales in comparison to gaming laptops and desktops around the same price.\nAlso consider\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Asus ROG Ally X | Lenovo Legion Go | Asus ROG Ally |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Price | $799.99 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,599 | $699.99 / \u00a3700 / AU$1,299 | $599.99 / \u00a3599 / AU$1,099 |\n| Display | 7-inch FHD (1920 x 1080), 120Hz, 500 nits | 8.8-inch QHD+, 144Hz, 500 nits, 97% DCI-P3 color gamut | 7-inch FHD (1920 x 1080), 120Hz, 500 nits |\n| CPU | AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme | AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme | AMD Ryzen Z1 / AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme |\n| Graphics | AMD Radeon Graphics | AMD Radeon Graphics | AMD Radeon Graphics |\n| RAM | 24GB LPDDR5X-7500 | 16GB LPDDR5X (7500Mhz) | 16GB LPDDR5 on board (6400MT/s dual channel) |\n| Storage | 1TB M.2 2280 SSD | Up to 1TB M.2 2242 SSD | 512GB PCIe 4.0 NVMe M.2 SSD (2230) |\n| Port selection | 2x USB Type-C ports, 1x combo jack, 1x SD card reader slot | 2x USB Type-C ports, 3.5mm headphone jack, microSD slot | 1x 3.5mm Combo Audio Jack, 1x ROG XG Mobile Interface and USB Type-C combo port |\n| Weight | 678g | 854g | 608g |\n| Dimensions | 280.2 x 114 x 36.9mm (WxDxH) | 298.83 x 131 x 40.7mm (WxDxH) | 280 x 111 x 32.4mm (WxDxH) |\nLenovo Legion Go\nThe Lenovo Legion Go comes with the same AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip as the ROG Ally X and a larger, higher-resolution and faster 8.8-inch screen, and costs quite a bit less.
