  "title": "This New York Hotel Promises A Good Night\u2019s Rest",
  "description": "Forbes Travel Guide gets a peek inside Equinox Hotel New York\u2019s Sleep Lab, which helps guests get rest using cutting-edge technology for the bed, room and beyond.",
  "content": "One of the hottest sectors in luxury travel isn\u2019t about seeking thrills but tranquility.\n\nThe global sleep tourism market, valued at $74.54 billion in 2024, is poised for 12.4% annual growth through 2030, a report says. The engine behind this boom is clear: with 74% of Americans losing sleep to stress and 68% to anxiety, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, the demand for a good night\u2019s rest has never been higher.\n\nThe advantages of quality slumber are well-documented: a stronger immune system, an improved mood and increased energy, to name a few. Still, this knowledge often gets lost between late-night emails and early-morning alarms.\n\nBut that\u2019s where Forbes Travel Guide Four-Star Equinox Hotel New York steps in. The Hudson Yards hotel has joined forces with Dr. Matthew Walker, one of the world\u2019s foremost experts in sleep science, to create The Equinox Hotels Sleep Lab. This science-backed initiative transforms four of the hotel\u2019s Premier King rooms into high-tech sanctuaries for rest. With temperature-controlled mattresses, targeted spa treatments and specialized amenities, this evidence-based approach promises you\u2019ll wake up feeling well-rested.\n\nThe sleep experience starts with the king-sized bed, which consists of two conjoined mattresses, each with its own duvet to eliminate the risk of a middle-of-the-night tug-of-war over covers. Each mattress is made from layers of entirely natural materials, including horsehair and seaweed.\n\nThe bed also gets a technology upgrade. Temperature-responsive sheets can be preset to align with the ideal settings for different points in the sleep cycle. The bed cools down to an optimal range of 60 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit and gradually warms as you begin to wake up.\n\nIn addition to measuring body temperature, the mattress impressively tracks metrics, such as the time it takes to fall asleep and the duration spent in each stage of the four sleep cycles, using indicators like heart rate and breathing patterns. When morning arrives, you\u2019ll find a sleep report waiting on an iPhone on the bedside table, complete with a sleep score based on the data collected.\n\nBeyond the bed, the room is designed to help guests fall asleep easily and wake up pleasantly. Thirty minutes before your desired sleep time, the lights begin to dim slowly. In the morning, they gradually brighten to mimic the soft, amber glow of natural sunlight and the heavenly sound of melodic chimes fill the room. This gentle wake-up call is a refreshing change from the usual blaring alarm of a smartphone.\n\nOne of the unique features of The Sleep Lab by Equinox Hotels is the 15-minute AM and PM Rituals, which can be accessed through the room\u2019s Apple TV. The PM routine helps prepare the body for rest with a breathwork exercise that involves a deep four-second inhale, a seven-second hold and an eight-second exhale to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps relax your body. Additionally, shoulder, lower back and calf stretches are included to relieve any tension accumulated throughout the day.\n\nThe AM Rituals start with a full-body scan and feature yoga sequences, such as sun salutations, designed to get your body moving and energy flowing. By the end of this session, you\u2019ll be shaking off any lingering morning fog.\n\nBoth videos are easy to follow. All the necessary equipment, including a Manduka yoga mat, cork blocks and a foam roller, are conveniently in the RoomBar (the hotel\u2019s wellness minibar).\n\nAlong with the fitness equipment, guests staying in The Sleep Lab by Equinox Hotels will find snooze-specific amenities: a valerian root and L-Theanine Dream supplement; a Dream, Plz wellness patch; a sleek, ergonomic eye mask (in case the blackout shades aren\u2019t enough for you); and Equinox Hotels\u2019 exclusive line of teas.\n\nThe tea selection features a calming chamomile, lavender and valerian root blend called Power Down and an invigorating Regenerate blend made with butterfly blue pea flower, ginger and lemon verbena.\n\nThe other suggested activations include the most spa-like element of The Sleep Lab: the in-room steam shower. It uses a custom blend of essential oils to promote sleep, giving the steam a warm, spicy aroma. When combined with the bedtime-specific body wash, which has a soothing and light citrus scent of chamomile, Tasmanian pepper and tangerine, the experience is a significant upgrade from a traditional hot bath before bed.\n\nThe morning ritual also features the shower \u2014 but an icy one. It is recommended to alternate between the steam and ice shower, which drops to a chilling 46 degrees. Although it may be uncomfortable, it\u2019s a surefire way to jump-start your morning, while also reducing inflammation and boosting circulation.\n\nBut if you can\u2019t handle the cold, you can still enjoy the invigorating AM body wash, which offers bright notes of sandalwood, rose and lime, along with a eucalyptus ginger body scrub.\n\nThe bedroom isn\u2019t the only place dedicated to better sleep. Four-Star The Spa by Equinox Hotels has science-driven treatments centered on promoting rest as well. The Art + Science of Sleep package includes two cryotherapy and wave table sessions at the spa. The cryotherapy requires three minutes in a minus-150-degree chamber, which, although not necessarily the most relaxing 180 seconds, does provide numerous benefits, such as reduced cortisol (better known as the stress hormone) and less inflammation. This can help alleviate pain and minimize the tossing and turning that can disrupt restful sleep.\n\nThe Wave Table, which looks like a glowing, blue waterbed on a massage table, promises to provide the equivalent of three hours of sleep in just 30 minutes. This is achieved with quantum harmonics played in headphones. The sounds, a mix of low, vibrational hums (similar to the chimes of a sound bowl) and waves crashing on a distant shore, are intended to mirror brain waves to reset circadian rhythms. The experience is a restorative one, like a great nap where you wake up fully alert.\n\nThe Spa by Equinox Hotels also offers sleep-targeted add-ons to treatments. One option is the NutriSleep IV, which is administered onsite by a medical professional. This painless IV delivers a high concentration of sleep-supportive nutrients such as magnesium, glycine and taurine. Alternatively, you might consider a stint in the infrared sauna. This service is the perfect complement to cryotherapy and can help regulate sleep-wake cycles by increasing melatonin production.",

      "text": "Although Palm Beach boasts the title of \u201cAmerica\u2019s first luxury resort destination,\u201d the 11-mile island along Florida\u2019s east coast isn\u2019t resting on its luxurious laurels. Many Gold Coast institutions, such as Yacht Club at The Boca Raton and The Colony Hotel, have undergone big makeovers, ensuring that Palm Beach\u2019s allure will never go out of style.\nWhether you seek a beachfront hotel inspired by Rome\u2019s Villa Medici or the enduring charm of the city\u2019s salmon-hued structures, you can trust Forbes Travel Guide\u2019s exclusive list for it. To find the best hotels in Palm Beach, our incognito inspectors posed as ordinary guests and stayed multiple nights at each property. The inspectors tested hundreds of exacting standards, with an emphasis on exceptional service, which accounts for 70% of a property\u2019s rating. The remaining 30% comes from the quality and condition of the facilities. FTG does not require a business relationship from the properties it rates, and it does not earn a commission if you book one of the following hotels.\nFive-Star Hotels\nBeach Club at The Boca Raton\nSprawled along a half mile of private sand, Beach Club is one of the area\u2019s top secluded beach vacation locations. It is part of the larger Boca Raton resort, which was designed as a gorgeous year-round seaside escape by architect Addison Mizner, whose Mediterranean Revival/Spanish Colonial Revival style came to define South Florida\u2019s aesthetic.\nThe recently reimagined Beach Club welcomes you with striking vistas of the Atlantic Ocean from the lobby and Beach Club lounge.\nBeyond, you\u2019ll find 210 cabana-style guest rooms and suites, three sparkling outdoor pools, Marisol restaurant, the new sand-side eatery Onda and an ocean-view fitness center. See more.\nFour Seasons Resort Palm Beach\nThe freshly renovated Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach unites the best of Palm Beach in one spot. Just minutes from famed Worth Avenue, the challenges of three championship golf courses and the thrill of the National Polo Center, Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach sits on one of the island\u2019s most expansive stretches of golden sand.\nThe authentic local ambiance combined with the resort\u2019s genuinely warm, attentive staff and an extensive list of amenities (signature dining, an 11-treatment room spa, pool-front cabanas) make for lasting memories that honor the island\u2019s long heritage of hospitality. See more.\nFour-Star Hotels\nThe Breakers Palm Beach\nA celebrity favorite since 1896 (and in its current building since 1926), The Breakers Palm Beach boasts a rich history rivaled only by its own penchant for constant reinvention. The result is a thoroughly modern and dynamic beachfront destination that welcomes you with a 200-foot, loggia-flanked, Murano-glass-dripping, vaulted main lobby based on a Renaissance castle in Genoa.\nBut there\u2019s much more to experience at the 140-acre property filled with 534 rooms and suites, 10 restaurants, two 18-hole golf courses and host of other posh perks. Our picks: Play a round on the Ocean Course \u2014 Florida\u2019s oldest golf course \u2014 and indulge in a treatment at the 20,000-square-foot, oceanfront spa. See more.\nTower at The Boca Raton\nA high-end-hotel-within-a-hotel at The Boca Raton, Tower at The Boca Raton stands as the tallest building on the sprawling property. The 27-story structure recently reopened after a $65 million transformation in 2022, boasting sweeping views, spacious suites and elevated luxury. The Tower manages to retain its historical charm (and even its original pink hue) while delivering modern amenities and a hip vibe.\nDive into the water with a private beach, two pool clubs and a marina. Or pursue land-based activities, including a Five-Star spa, an 18-hole golf course, tennis, pickleball, an art gallery and more than a dozen restaurants and lounges. See more.\nYacht Club at The Boca Raton\nYacht Club at The Boca Raton is the all-suite, adults-only hideaway within the 200-acre resort. The property boasts a prime position overlooking Lake Boca, a 50,000-square-foot wellness oasis and a sparkling new four-acre Harborside Pool Club.\nThe hotel delivers water views from every suite \u2014 enjoy the tranquil scene from your balcony. And if you need anything, a butler stands ready to assist.\nA reservation at the Yacht Club also grants you access to The Boca Raton\u2019s many amenities, but the Flybridge is exclusively for Yacht Club hotel guests and members. Perched on the hotel\u2019s top floor, the fine-dining restaurant with a view is a coveted reservation. See more.\nRecommended Hotels\nThe Colony Hotel\nA pastel-pink high-rise flanked by swaying palms and perfectly manicured hedges, The Colony Hotel is the very picture of Palm Beach luxury. A mixture of elegance and whimsy, the historic property underwent a full makeover in 2022 to debut a refreshed lobby and a set of suites that embodies the unique spirit of this colorful retro-chic paradise.\nLong a wintertime playground of the rich and famous, The Colony continues to attract modern-day glitterati with its jovial bar featuring live music, oasis-like pool replete with lawn games and ever-popular restaurant Swifty\u2019s.

      "text": "The global sleep tourism market size was estimated at USD 74.54 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 148.98 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 12.4% from 2025 to 2030. The hospitality industry is witnessing a significant shift as sleep tourism gains traction, driven by travelers seeking rest and rejuvenation.\nThis trend aligns closely with the booming wellness industry, as individuals increasingly seek restorative experiences. Sleep scientist Rebecca Robbins highlights the importance of sleep quality in ensuring guest satisfaction, noting that restful sleep while traveling often predicts whether guests will return to a hotel. With two-thirds of Americans reporting better sleep in hotels than at home in 2024, according to a 2024 blog by Hilton, the hospitality industry is embracing this demand by offering specialized amenities to enhance sleep quality.\nHotels are reimagining their offerings to cater to the sleep tourism industry by introducing advanced sleep-enhancing features. Brands like Hilton have implemented \u201cPower Down\u201d amenities, including temperature-regulating mattresses and dim light settings. Meanwhile, properties such as Park Hyatt New York have gone further, featuring AI-powered smart beds and sleep-related wellness packages. These initiatives align with the tourism industry\u2019s broader focus on catering to travelers seeking relaxation and wellness during their stays.\nTechnology is playing a pivotal role in advancing the sleep tourism market. Smart beds with AI capabilities, soundproof rooms, and white noise machines are becoming standard in upscale hotels. For instance, Zedwell in London offers distraction-free environments, while Six Senses incorporates sleep trackers and consultations with sleep experts into their curated programs. Such innovations reflect the hospitality industry\u2019s dedication to using cutting-edge solutions to meet guests\u2019 wellness needs.\nThe growing popularity of sleep tourism stems from increased awareness of the importance of rest for mental and physical health. Reports show that travelers often cite rest and recharge as their primary motivation for trips, driving the demand for sleep-centric accommodations. This aligns with the broader wellness industry, which emphasizes holistic well-being. With curated experiences like sleep therapy and mindfulness programs, hotels are meeting consumer expectations for a complete wellness retreat.\nThe convergence of the hospitality industry and wellness industry is fueling innovation in sleep tourism. Destinations are integrating sleep-focused services such as pillow menus, sleep kits, and customized sleep programs to provide unparalleled experiences. Resorts like Castle Hot Springs offer packages that combine restorative activities with luxurious sleep-enhancing amenities. As the trend continues to evolve, the sleep tourism industry is poised to become a cornerstone of the global tourism industry, delivering restorative escapes that leave travelers rejuvenated.\nAccording to Hilton's poll results, which were released in October 2023, rest and recharge were expected to be the main reasons why people will travel in 2024. While taking a pleasure vacation frequently entails escaping work or everyday responsibilities, modern travelers define rest more broadly as getting a good night's sleep regardless of the purpose of their trip. Sleep has become more important due to the increased emphasis on wellbeing, and major companies are changing to improve their on-property experience.\nAccording to the same data, some travelers admit to bringing their own pillow to ensure a good night\u2019s sleep. Recognizing this growing trend in 2023, many hotels worldwide introduced Pillow Menus to offer a personalized sleep experience. Properties like Conrad Osaka in Japan, Waldorf Astoria Xiamen in China, Conrad Centennial Singapore, Waldorf Astoria Dubai Palm Jumeirah, Hilton London Bankside in the UK, Rome Cavalieri, A Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Italy, and Conrad Dubai in the UAE have embraced this concept, tailoring amenities to meet guests' unique preferences and enhance their comfort.\nSecondary sleep tourism trips held a market share of about 82% in the overall sleep tourism market in 2024. Travelers on general leisure or business trips increasingly seek accommodations that enhance their sleep quality. These secondary wellness trips focus on integrating sleep-boosting amenities, such as pillow menus, blackout curtains, and smart beds, into standard hospitality offerings. With more mid-range and budget-friendly options available, the market has expanded to attract middle-market travelers. This affordability and accessibility are driving the growth of secondary sleep tourism, where enhancing rest complements other travel objectives.\nPrimary sleep tourism trips set to grow at a CAGR of 12.8% from 2025 to 2030. It is expected to gain momentum as travelers prioritize wellness and restorative experiences. Demand is rising for sleep-focused retreats offering curated sleep programs, sleep therapy sessions, and high-tech amenities designed to improve rest. As awareness of the health benefits of quality sleep grows, more travelers are choosing destinations specifically for sleep rejuvenation. Luxury accommodations are capitalizing on this trend by offering immersive sleep-focused experiences, making sleep tourism a standalone travel motivation in the wellness and hospitality industries.\nDomestic sleep tourism accounted for a share of about 63% in the overall sleep tourism industry in 2024. This sector is driven by affordability, convenience, and changing travel preferences. In 2022, domestic wellness tourists spent 175% more per trip than the average domestic traveler, at USD 668 per trip, according to data by Global Wellness Institute published in March 2024, showcasing its high-yield nature. The pandemic fueled a surge in domestic travel, with travelers seeking nearby wellness experiences due to international restrictions. The accessibility of sleep-focused amenities, such as customized bedding and sleep therapy programs, has further expanded the appeal of domestic sleep tourism among middle-market travelers.\nInternational sleep tourism is projected to grow at a CAGR of 13.3% from 2025 to 2030. International sleep tourism is poised for growth as wellness-focused travelers seek transformative experiences abroad. While the spending premium for international wellness tourists declined from 65% in 2012 to 41% in 2022, they still spent significantly more than average international travelers, at USD 1,764 per trip. This shift reflects the rise of accessible, secondary wellness trips. However, as travel normalizes post-pandemic, high-end sleep retreats and programs tailored to primary sleep tourism will attract global travelers, driving demand for premium international offerings.\nHotels emerged as a dominating accommodation in the sleep tourism market, holding a share of about 46% in 2024. Hotels are leading the sleep tourism industry by integrating wellness-focused innovations that cater to the growing demand for quality sleep experiences. With offerings like Bryte's smart mattresses, available in luxury properties such as Park Hyatt New York and Waldorf Astoria Monarch Beach, guests can customize firmness and use relaxation technology like Somnify for improved rest. Hotels also partner with cutting-edge solutions, including FreshBed\u2019s ergonomic mattresses with climate control, enhancing sleep comfort. Additionally, retreats like Rosewood\u2019s Alchemy of Sleep and Canyon Ranch\u2019s sleep immersion programs underscore hotels' pivotal role in promoting sleep wellness.\nDemand for accommodations in retreat centers for sleep tourism is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.1% from 2025 to 2030. Sleep-focused retreat centers like Sal Salis are set to grow in demand as travelers seek restorative escapes that blend luxury with sustainability. With eco-friendly features like solar-powered accommodations and activities promoting relaxation, such as stargazing and snorkeling, these retreats offer unique, off-grid experiences. As wellness tourism rises, such retreats cater to the increasing focus on rest, nature, and mindful living.\nThe sleep tourism market in North America accounted for a share of around 36% in 2024. Sleep tourism is thriving in North America as luxury hotels cater to health-conscious travelers seeking rest and rejuvenation. With offerings like premium bedding, pillow menus, soundproofed rooms, and sleep-promoting amenities, properties such as The Four Seasons Toronto and The Ritz-Carlton Toronto lead the trend. Strategic wellness tips, paired with curated dining options, enhance the appeal, making the region a hub for sleep-focused getaways.\nIn 2024, the sleep tourism market in the U.S. accounted for a share of about 75% in North America. The U.S. sleep tourism sector is thriving as wellness-focused travelers seek restorative getaways tailored to improving sleep and reducing stress. Luxury retreats like Sensei Lanai in Hawaii offer bespoke sleep programs with expert guidance, while destinations such as Mountain Shadows in Arizona provide sleep-inducing amenities like golden moon milk and aromatherapy mists. Urban hotels like Smyth Tribeca in New York cater to relaxation with plush bedding and curated bedtime experiences. Additionally, resorts like Castle Hot Springs feature specialized retreats led by sleep experts, combining luxury and science to foster better rest.\nThe sleep tourism market in Europe accounted for a share of about 28% in 2024. Europe's sleep tourism is growing as travelers seek respite from modern life's relentless pace. Destinations like Sweden leverage their tranquil wilderness, dark skies, and cultural emphasis on relaxation to promote better sleep. In the Stockholm archipelago, serene forest cabins and peaceful island life encourage restorative experiences. Sleep researchers like Uppsala University's Christian Benedict highlight how nature improves mental health and combats sleep disruptions caused by technology. With tailored sleep retreats and activities in pristine settings, Europe's natural landscapes and cultural traditions offer unique sleep-focused escapes.\nThe sleep tourism market in Asia Pacific is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.8% from 2025 to 2030. Asia-Pacific sleep tourism is set to grow as travelers seek restorative experiences to combat stress, burnout, and sleep disruptions. Destinations like Thailand, Bali, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam offer tranquil settings, combining natural beauty with innovative sleep wellness programs. Resorts such as Kamalaya Koh Samui in Thailand and Ayurveda retreats in Sri Lanka provide tailored packages featuring sleep therapies, spa treatments, and digital detoxes. Bali\u2019s sleep-focused resorts incorporate sound therapy and aromatherapy for enhanced rest, while Vietnam blends cultural wellness with luxurious accommodations. Asia-Pacific's holistic and diverse offerings make it a top choice for sleep tourism.\nThe sleep tourism market is fragmented primarily due to the presence of several globally recognized players as well as regional players. Some prominent companies in this market are Hilton, InterContinental Hotels Group PLC, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group, The Laslet, and Careys Manor among others. Market players are differentiating through expansions of service portfolio, investments, and innovations to cater to evolving consumer preferences.\nThe following are the leading companies in the sleep tourism market. These companies collectively hold the largest market share and dictate industry trends.\nIn March 2024, Hilton introduced Sleep Retreats at Grand Wailea, a Waldorf Astoria Resort in Hawaii, designed in collaboration with sleep expert Dr. Rebecca Robbins. These retreats include lectures, spa services, sleep-promoting meals, and personalized schedules to enhance restfulness. Aligning with rising demand for wellness tourism, Hilton also integrates sleep-focused amenities across its hotel portfolio.\nIn March 2024, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group on World Sleep Day introduced an in-house sleep concierge, English hypnotherapist Malminder Gill, to offer tailored sleep therapy sessions at its London properties and select European locations. The 60-minute sessions, costing about USD 600, included consultations and sleep-inducing hypnosis, enhancing wellness offerings within the hospitality industry.\nIn January 2022, Ruby Group announced its continued European expansion with a new hotel in Florence set to open in Q3 2023. Located on Piazza della Libert\u00e0, the 118-room property featured maisonette-style rooms, a Ruby Workspace, and sleep-focused amenities, including soundproofing, blackout curtains, and hypoallergenic bedding designed with sleep experts.\n|\nReport Attribute |\nDetails |\n|\nMarket size value in 2025 |\nUSD 83.14 billion |\n|\nRevenue forecast in 2030 |\nUSD 148.98 billion |\n|\nGrowth rate (Revenue) |\nCAGR of 12.4% from 2025 to 2030 |\n|\nHistorical data |\n2018 - 2024 |\n|\nForecast period |\n2025 - 2030 |\n|\nQuantitative units |\nRevenue in USD billion and CAGR from 2025 to 2030 |\n|\nReport coverage |\nRevenue forecast, company ranking, competitive landscape, growth factors, and trends |\n|\nSegments covered |\nPurpose, travel type, accommodation, region |\n|\nRegional scope |\nNorth America; Europe; Asia Pacific; Central & South America; & Middle East & Africa |\n|\nCountry scope |\nU.S.; Canada; Mexico; U.K.; Germany; France; Italy; Spain; Japan; China; India; Japan; South Korea; Australia & New Zealand; South Africa; UAE; Brazil; Argentina |\n|\nKey companies profiled |\nHilton; InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (Six Senses, etc); Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group; The Laslett; Careys Manor; Ruby Lucy Hotel; Pan Pacific Hotels Group; Canyon Ranch; Waldorf Astoria Los Cabos Pedregal; Castle Hot Springs |\n|\nCustomization |\nFree report customization (equivalent up to 8 analysts working days) with purchase.

      "text": "Asking people what type of car they drive is a lot like asking where they vacation \u2014 the answer reveals a great deal. Status, design, comfort, past experiences and brand loyalty all play into the response.\nThese natural synergies are prompting automobile manufacturers and hospitality brands to unite and leverage their shared appeal to travelers to ensure their journey is just as luxurious as the destination.\nAs a result, upon checking into your next hotel, you might be offered your own vehicle or a chauffeured drive that acts as an extension of the property\u2019s superior service.

Then back at the hotel, you\u2019ll enjoy a treatment at the Five-Star spa and a private wellness class.\nThe new Navigator features an immersive 48-inch panoramic display that spans the length of the horizontal instrument panel, minimizing visual clutter. The SUV also introduces Lincoln Rejuvenate, a \u201cspa on wheels\u201d experience that uses the four senses to keep drivers and passengers charged and recharged. The five- and 10-minute encounters (done when the car is parked, of course) have the driver\u2019s seat slide away, recline, warm and massage. Relaxing visuals and sounds work through the display. Ambient lighting and seven in-cabin fragrances help set a tranquil tone.\nTake a Navigator out for the day and explore Park City and surrounding areas such as Guardsman Pass with its alpine views; the trails of Big Cottonwood Canyon or Midway; or Mirror Lake Highway, an alpine trek with panoramic overlooks, waterfalls and forest-lined roads.\nOther hotels around the U.S. where you can have a Lincoln experience include the Five-Star Faena Miami Beach and Casa Cipriani in New York.\nRivian and The Ranch at Laguna Beach\nThe 87-acre Forbes Travel Guide Recommended Ranch at Laguna Beach teamed up with electric adventure vehicle Rivian, marking the first collaboration in California between a hotel and the Irvine-based automaker.\nThe Ranch at Laguna Beach features the R1S (with its front trunk for golf bags) and R1T (with bike and stand-up paddleboard racks), available for resort guests based on availability.
