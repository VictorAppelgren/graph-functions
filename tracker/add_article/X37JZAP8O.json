      "summary": "Washington, DC Police Chief Pamela Smith has signed an executive order allowing local police to share information with federal immigration enforcement, despite existing prohibitions against inquiring about immigration status. This move comes amid President Trump's federalization of DC's police force and a crackdown on illegal immigration, raising concerns among immigrant communities about safety and local autonomy. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who previously identified DC as a sanctuary city, has shifted her stance, proposing changes to local laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.",
