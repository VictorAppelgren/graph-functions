  "content": "Crystal Palace fans have become well-known throughout football for the fantastic atmosphere they create at Selhurst Park, but it is when the supporters have to unite that they show the best of themselves.\n\nThe Eagles are well followed pretty much wherever they go and with the Holmesdale fanatics, there is a consistent block of noise coming from that stand at every game.\n\nEven though Palace won the first major trophy in their history last season, it has not been the summer of celebration many had hoped for.\n\nThe demotion to the Conference League from the Europa League has hung over the club, with supporters hoping the appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport will fall in their favour.\n\nYet the one thing this has highlighted is what I have seen when following and reporting on the club - that Palace fans do their best work when they have something to get behind.\n\nI reported on the fan-organised protest that was put on after the club was demoted and I attended a large portion of the FA Cup run.\n\nThe tifo displays organised for the cup semi-final and final were widely praised, not only for their skill but for the message of what it means to be a football fan.\n\nAt the final, the tifo showed Palace fan Mark Wealleans, who died in 2017, celebrating an iconic goal with his two sons. That is a scene is replicated around the country in most grounds when the ball finds the back of the net.\n\nSupporters have protested against the club going into administration, have got behind the team in relegation battles and have also now seen the glory of a cup win.\n\nThe biggest thing I have learned from covering Palace is, no matter what type of season the team are having, their fans will find something to unite them.\n\nJoin the conversation and tell your story about why you love Palace",

  "summary": "Crystal Palace fans are renowned for their incredible atmosphere at Selhurst Park and their unity, particularly when the team is struggling. Despite winning their first major trophy in their history last season, the club's demotion to the Conference League from the Europa League has led to uncertainty for fans. The appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport is expected to be successful. Alex Howell has witnessed this phenomenon, reporting on fan-organised protests and the FA Cup run, where tifo displays were praised for their message. Despite the team's struggles, Howell believes that no matter what season is going to be, their fans find something to unite them.",

We qualified for it,\" Nick Philpot from the Red and Blue Review podcast said at the march.\n\"We won the cup - it should be we go into it without any question about it.\n\"You're penalising the entire club and the fanbase. Why would you do that?\"\nLast week, Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish called the decision \"a bad day for football\" and \"a terrible injustice\".\n\"We've been locked out of a European competition on the most ridiculous technicality,\" he said. \"Supporters of all clubs should be devastated for us.\"\nUefa has been approached for comment.\nRelated topics\n- Published11 July\n- Published11 July\n- Published26 July 2022"
