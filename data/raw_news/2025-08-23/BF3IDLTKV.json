  "title": "Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 is not the faithful sequel I'd hoped to see, but maybe that's a bigger marker of progress than it seems",
  "description": "I've come through the disappointment and emerged newly hopeful \u2013 for my own sanity",
  "content": "Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 is one of the most embattled new games on 2025's roster. Last year's gameplay reveal left many World of Darkness fans feeling tepid toward it \u2013 myself included. When I read my editor's impressions in his recent Bloodlines 2 hands-on preview, I felt the flames of hope spark up once more. However, following the new release date trailer shown at Gamescom Opening Night Live, the community's skepticism has only intensified.\n\nI get it. After numerous delays and a total rework that saw it picked up by Still Wake the Deep developer The Chinese Room, the upcoming RPG had a lot to live up to. Specifically, the legacy carved out by Troika's 2004 cult classic, Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines. At face value, I agree that the sequel and its predecessor look like night and day next to each other. But I'm still not going to judge The Chinese Room too hard for the direction it's taken things, because if I really think about it, Bloodlines 2's very existence is a miracle in itself.\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms I've been reading is that Bloodlines 2 looks far too combat-oriented compared to the first game.\n\n\n\nWith its slick, first-person combat, comparisons to Dishonored sound pretty fair in my book, but at the same time, that's because The Chinese Room has a lot to prove when so many of us panned the rough, blocky look of its combat last February. Still, it makes sense that fans of the first Bloodlines weren't expecting anything of the sort to begin with.\n\nThe original Vampire RPG drew more heavily and recognizably from the tabletop game it's based on, being a more narrative-focused experience than a combat one. But while The Chinese Room is targeting an immersive combat experience more in-line with modern RPGs, it's worth pointing out that the studio has already stipulated in a dev diary that three kinds of gameplay styles will be implemented to help players tailor their approach \u2013 Strategic Stalker, Action Brawler, and Narrative Adventurer. Why only one of those three has been focused on in gameplay reveals is a little unfortunate, but it does show acknowledgement of the RPG's tabletop roots.\n\nBut even with the fact that we could be able to play Bloodlines 2 in a more old-school way, another big complaint is still the fact that our protagonist, Phyre, is a customizable set character rather than a wholly player-made creation.\n\n\n\nI've spoken in the past about how that could be a good thing in itself (especially off the back of playing Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Swansong). But given The Chinese Room's past mention of wanting to make a thoroughly modern game with Bloodlines 2, I can't fault the studio for simply getting with the times.\n\nFrom Cyberpunk 2077 to The Witcher 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2, character-driven games have proven to be incredibly popular in the last decade, and Bloodlines 2 is simply following suit.\n\n\n\nThese games tell focused stories about specific people, and though we have a lot of customization and role-playing choices to make in them, the plots largely follow a set of predetermined outcomes. Even Baldur's Gate 3's most intriguing character background, The Dark Urge, is more narrativized than simply playing a player-made character. Larian's increased control over storytelling makes it one of the most memorable and best video game stories I've ever encountered, and no other playthrough has ever come close to how much I enjoyed my Durge run.\n\nI might be an outlier in saying so, but I adore playing games for the plot. I like to get to know my protagonists and root for them, making decisions I feel would reflect their own characteristics and psychologies, and I'm excited to have that same opportunity in Bloodlines 2.\n\nThe Chinese Room had a lot of time to make up for when it took on the project in 2021, but the fact that we're getting a Bloodlines 2 at all makes me incredibly grateful. Working off expectations set by a now-defunct studio is no small task, even with the day-one extra clan DLC announcement causing (understable yet) unexpected backlash from fans. The Chinese Room still has a chance to deliver something awesome, once it does it a little damage control. Plus, if it's good enough for Larian's own Swen Vincke, it's good enough for me to at least give it a chance, too.\n\nCheck out the host of upcoming RPGs we can't wait to play in 2025",

      "text": "I'm convinced that 2025 will bring us the next Baldur's Gate 3, and these are all the upcoming RPGs that may prove me right\nFrom The Outer Worlds 2 to Witchbrook, these are all the upcoming RPGs still heading our way in 2025\nThere are so many upcoming RPGs heading our way this year and next that, as a fan of the genre, I'm officially a tad bit overstimulated. This year has already seen tons of new additions to my personal roster of the best RPGs, such as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and Avowed. However, there are still plenty of new games on the near horizon.\nFirstly, we have some vampire-based outings, tactical titles, remakes of some of the best JRPGs, and some hidden indie gems that aren't being talked about nearly enough. With so many titles on the cards, I'm convinced that the next big RPG breakout success that will have us all in a chokehold (like Baldur's Gate 3 did in 2023) is just a stone's throw away. So, to keep track of the genre, I've made a list of all the upcoming RPGs that have grabbed my attention so far.\nBelow, I've organized all the new games by their release date, making sure you know what the latest release is. I've also made sure to detail platforms and offer some descriptions about each future RPG, too. So, what are you waiting for? There's a role-playing game that needs to be prepared for.\nUpcoming RPGs in 2025\nStory of Seasons: Grand Bazaar\nRelease date: August 27, 2025\nPlatforms: PC, Switch, Switch 2\nThe remake of Harvest Moon DS: Grand Bazaar, Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar, is the most laid-back RPG on our list and will have you living out a quaint life in Zephyr Town. You'll need to farm, earn cash, and work towards improving the once bustling community back to its former glory. Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar is a perfect cozy alternative to the rest of the RPGs on this list. It's also bringing back love rivals to its romance system, making it easier to fully immerse yourself in the game as the story and characters feel more alive in general.\nLost Soul Aside\nRelease date: August 29, 2025\nPlatforms: PC, PS5\nIn terms of new RPGs that look like they have a grand story, Lost Soul Aside stands out from the rest of the pack. We'll follow the adventures of Kaser as he journeys through multiple worlds and dimensions to save his sister (as well as the rest of humanity from some kind of invaders). From trailers that we've seen so far, the RPG seems like it will have some hack-and-slash combat and plenty of big bosses to take down as well. However, we are still waiting to learn more about the details. So, stay tuned for updates.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nDemon School\nRelease date: September 3, 2025\nPlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch\nWe love the vibe of this upcoming RPG! Demon School follows Fay and her friends as they try to navigate university life while on a mysterious island. One thing leads to another, and it looks like Faye will be battling strange foes in both her world and a demon plane of existence. Turn-based combat is the main feature, it looks like, however, we are still waiting on more information regarding this title's story and gameplay. We'll keep you posted as soon as we learn more.\nWander Stars\nRelease date: September 19, 2025\nPlatforms: PC, Switch\nWander Stars looks like a promising upcoming RPG that may have the makings to join the ranks of our best anime games list as well. Ringo and a mysterious wolf partner join forces in order to find the Wanderstar Map; however, their journey is filled with trouble. Turn-based combat will be in full force here, as you deal with enemy encounters as you make your way through a charming anime series-inspired story. I love just about everything that Wander Stars is promising, and if you were a '90s anime fan, this should be on your radar, too.\nConsume Me\nRelease date: September 25, 2025\nPlatforms: PC\nConsume Me looks adorable and is an upcoming slice-of-life role-playing game that follows Jenny. Getting everything done in a day is tricky, and it'll be up to you to pick Jenny's schedule and try to help her have a great childhood. See your choices play out and in this \"darkly funny coming-of-age story\". There are 13 endings you could get here, so it sounds like the game has some great replay ability as well!\nAtelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist & the White Guardian\nRelease date: September 26, 2025\nPlatforms: PC, PS5, PS4, Switch\nIf you are a lover of RPGs with cute aesthetics, chances are you are familiar with the Atelier series. Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist & the White Guardian marks the 27th game in the franchise and sees the protagonist returning to the town of Hallfein, which for years had been a restricted area. You'll have to uncover the truth behind what happened to the town's residents and engage in a few battles in the process. Exploration, as well as some city-building mechanics, are on display in this one!\nFinal Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles\nRelease date: September 30, 2025\nPlatforms: PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Switch 2\nWhen it comes to iconic RPGs, Final Fantasy has to be in the conversation. So, of course, we had to put the remake of one of the best tactical RPGs on our list. You play as Ramza Beoulve, who must navigate a difficult period of war. That means, basically, it's up to you to win turn-based battles and strategically balance a character class system in order to come out on top. This new remaster keeps everything we loved about the original while also offering enhanced graphics and refined gameplay too, what more could you want?\nDigimon Story: Time Stranger\nRelease date: October 2, 2025\nPlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S\nIn 2025, not only are we getting a new Pokemon game, but a new Digimon is also on it way. In this creature-collecting RPG, you'll be thrown into a story that takes place across the human world and the Digital World. However, unlike past titles, the separate worlds are being expanded, and there are some parallel dimension mentions that may be in the cards as well. Digimon is a bit more complicated in terms of combat than Pokemon. So if you want to try the series out for the first time and like a challenge, then keep your eyes on this title!\nPokemon Legends Z-A\nRelease date: October 16, 2025\nPlatforms: Switch, Switch 2\nFor many of us, Pokemon is where we first started our RPG journeys, so of course Nintendo is giving us a new title in the franchise to celebrate their latest console. Pokemon Legends Z-A will have us taking on the role of trainer once again as we explore Lumiose City, which is currently developing a place where Pokemon and humans can co-exist. Unlike past games in the franchise, though, there is going to be a real-time combat system instead of the classic turn-based setup we are all familiar with. We're super intrigued to see how this one plays and if the changes will be for the better!\nVampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2\nRelease date: October 21, 2025\nPlatforms: PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S\nVampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines is one of the best vampire RPGs ever made, so we are waiting anxiously for news of a release date for its sequel. Developed by The Chinese Room, the new game will have us embodying the Elder vampire Phyre in 21st-century Seattle. We'll get to meet different clans, learn our backstory, and grow our vampiric powers. Honestly, it sounds like a dream. However, we've been waiting for this one for years now, so we are curious to see more updates before we get our hopes too high.\nMoonlighter 2: The Endless Vault\nRelease date: October 23, 2025\nPlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S\nEveryone's favourite merchant RPG with some swanky roguelike mechanics is making a comeback this year. Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault will have us trying to fill up an empty coin purse with a heap of coins as we try to get back on our feet and run the best little shop you can imagine. Explore dungeons, collect anything that seems remotely valuable, and sell it to some happy customers. Currently, Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault is set to release in October, so it isn't long now!\nThe Outer Worlds 2\nRelease date: October 29, 2005\nPlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S\nObsidian Entertainment has given us some of the best RPGs over the years, and we have high hopes for their upcoming outing The Outer Worlds 2. The game is set in an alternate future (one where Theodore Roosevelt never became president). As a result, mega corporations rule the day and have started to colonize alien planets. You'll play as an agent sent to one of the colonies and will meet a host of colorful characters along the way. The game looks utterly fantastic. And honestly, this is our highest anticipated RPG of the year.\nDragon Quest I & II HD-2D Remake\nRelease date: October 30, 2025\nPlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Switch 2\nAnother remake that should be on everyone's radar is the modern take of some of the best JRPGs of all time. The Dragon Quest I & II HD-2D Remake bundles two games in one, and let's you first play as Erdrick before moving on to the sequel, where you take on the role of his descendants. However, no matter who you play as, the goal remains: save the land. The remake offers improved graphics and performance. It's definitely one that I'll be picking up once it releases.\nInazuma Eleven: Victory Road\nRelease date: November 13, 2025\nPlatforms: PC, Switch, PS5, PS4\nSports games and RPGs don't generally mix, that is, unless we are talking about the famed Inazuma Eleven series. Football and RPG elements come together in this new game, as we take on the role of the high school student Destin Billows as he enrolls in one of the top schools in the nationals, the prestigious Raimon Junior High. Story and sports gameplay are melded together here, and the animation style feels as if it'll throw you into your very own shounen anime series, too.\nOctopath Traveler 0\nRelease date: December 4, 2025\nPlatforms: PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Switch, Switch 2\nOctopath Traveler became a fast favourite of most RPG fans back when it released in 2018. So, I was massively excited to see that a new prequel to the original game got announced during the recent July Nintendo Direct live stream. Octopath Traveler 0 will be breaking the typical Otcopath mold as the character you'll be playing this time around isn't one of a few premade ones like previous outings. Instead, you'll have a customizable character who can recruit a party from 30 different NPC choices for a quest involving rebuilding their home village. I'm still waiting to learn more gameplay details but it seems like another turn-based combat affair so far.\nTBC 2025\nWitchbrook\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nPlatforms: PC, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox Series X/S\nIt's been years, but we finally know that the cozy witch RPG Witchbrook will be releasing in Winter this year. If you've ever dreamed of playing as a magical student who also happens to live in an adorable seaside town, then this game is here to answer all your wishes. Learn spells, attend classes, and even fall in love with this delightful little title. We are keeping our eyes peeled for news constantly when it comes to Witchbrook, so be sure to check in on this page to learn about any new updates as well!\nTBC 2026\nCrimson Desert\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nPlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S\nDeveloped on the proprietary BlackSpace Engine, Crimson Desert looks as if it just may be the next big fantasy RPG. A prequel to Black Desert Online, the game follows Kliff Macduff, who is forced to rise into a leadership role after the King of Demeniss falls into a coma. Meet mercenaries, explore an open world, and hack your way through a ton of enemies. We have high hopes for this one and have our fingers crossed that we get a release date soon.\nFable 4\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X/S\nIn terms of iconic RPGs, few series are as well-known as Fable, so yeah, Fable 4 is on every fan's mind. Originally, this title was slated for 2025 but was pushed back to 2026 instead. Hopefully, this is the last delay, though, as the trailers that we've seen already for this one look fantastic. Cinematic clips of the title are filled with wonder and humor. We've seen sword fighting and also fireball magic, meaning that for fantasy fans, this seems like it will be a keeper. Fingers crossed, we get a release date soon.\nLords of the Fallen 2\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nPlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S\nLords of the Fallen 2 is a standalone sequel to Lords of the Fallen and shocked every RPG fan when it was announced during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025. Taking place 100 years after its predecessor, Lords of the Fallen 2 looks absolutely brutal, throwing us back into a dark fantasy world with mind-boggling, challenging combat. Currently, we don't know many details just yet, as it was only recently revealed, but we do know that it'll be coming out sometime in 2026. So, stay tuned for updates.\nOnimusha: Way of the Sword\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nPlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S\nIf you are a fan of action-RPGs, then you'll be pleased to know that Onimusha: Way of the Sword is set to launch in 2026. In this upcoming game, you'll get to explore the Japanese capital of Edo-era Kyoto during a turbulent time where supernatural forces are gripping the land. Battle against various monsters as you follow the story of a samurai who wields the Oni Gauntlet. With sword play, lots of enemy encounters waiting, and mysteries to uncover, Onimusha: Way of the Sword looks to be one of the RPGs that will never leave you bored.\nMonster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nPlatforms: Switch 2, PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S\nAnother turn-based RPG is heading our way in 2026 with Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection. If you are a Monster Hunter fan, then you know the deal: explore and tame new creatures and progress through a grand story. The Monster Hunter Stories series are single-player affairs instead of the online outings of the other games, and this upcoming entry will be immersing you in a story involving a kingdom at war. Color us intrigued! It's also great to know that this won't be a Switch 2 exclusive, despite being revealed during a Direct.\nThe Blood of Dawnwalker\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nPlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S\nI'm a self-proclaimed fantasy fan and vampire nerd, so The Blood of Dawnwalker has been one of my most anticipated games on the horizon since it was first announced. It's an upcoming title that utilizes time as you only have 30 days and 30 nights to save your sister. The good news is that you are playing as Coen, who is currently half-human, half-creature of the night. That means that in your time-limited quests, you'll have plenty of ability to make the most of your actions. But whether you choose to succumb to your new urges or cling to humanity is a trickier matter. The Blood of Dawnwalker looks to be the vampire RPG I've been waiting for, and I'll be picking it up as soon as I can.\nFor more future releases, head over to our lists of all the upcoming Switch 2 games, upcoming PS5 games, and new PC games.\nAfter reviewing films throughout University and being a cosy game expert for years, I realised that entertainment journalism was my true calling in 2019.

      "text": "After waiting over 20 years for Bloodlines 2, ex Dragon Age writer says \"the hope is that we would get a new Vampire game in the same line as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 or Baldur's Gate 3\"\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has enormous potential even after many setbacks\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has cleared a big hurdle: the follow-up to a cult 2004 RPG is finally, for real, \"done.\" Now it just has to, you know, launch. As a long-delayed October 2025 launch approaches, former Dragon Age lead writer David Gaider hopes the hotly awaited sequel can tap into the same energy as RPGs like Baldur's Gate 3 and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, channeling the strengths of what inspired it and doubling down on what makes its world unique.\nSpeaking to PCGamesN, Gaider reckons \"the hope is that we would get a new Vampire game in the same line as Expedition 33 or Baldur's Gate 3 \u2013 let's take [VTM] and see what we can do with it. Wouldn't it be great to have a full-on RPG that wasn't beholden to the fantasy or sci-fi genre, one that really leaned into the roleplaying systems of Vampire: The Masquerade?\"\nGaider praises the non-combat segments of the original Bloodlines, and says those areas actually gave him \"some ammunition\" when he pushed for non-combat sections in Dragon Age games.\nHe also zeroes in on the tabletop origins of the Vampire games. \"If you've played the tabletop version, it didn't do a lot of combat, but what it did with characters and inter-character relationships, as well as the various powers you had and how those changed the way you played the game completely, [had] some meat there,\" he says. \"I wish somebody would just take that to its logical conclusion and give us the game that's meant to exist.\"\nWe previously spoke to Gaider about what, in his words, makes Expedition 33 to JRPGs almost what Baldur's Gate 3 was to CRPGs.\nHe reasoned that these games show not just how many people good RPGs can reach, or \"what's possible when a game is given time to cook,\" but also how games can focus on one audience so hard \"that it ends up growing that audience\" rather than pursuing mass appeal from the get-go. The sequel to a game as niche as the original Bloodlines would also do well, I'd wager, to bet on specificity rather than grabbing the biggest audience possible.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nAustin has been a game journalist for 12 years, having freelanced for the likes of PC Gamer, Eurogamer, IGN, Sports Illustrated, and more while finishing his journalism degree.

      "text": "Now that I know The Blood of Dawnwalker is a vampire game that's not about Doing The Right Thing as a Very Special Boy, 2026 can't come soon enough\nOpinion | Dawnwalker might fix the most boring thing about vampire RPGs: morality in immortality\nDark, violent, and dripping with medieval horrors, The Blood of Dawnwalker has devoured my attention this summer. The upcoming vampire RPG is the brainchild of ex-Witcher 3 developers over at their studio Rebel Wolves, and after two heaped servings of new intel thanks to a trailer at Summer Game Fest and a juicy gameplay overview, I'm psyched for more than just another fantasy game.\nRebel Wolves has described its new game as a narrative sandbox experience \u2013 and that autonomy extends to its combat systems, too. As a half human, half vampire, The Blood of Dawnwalker protagonist Coen has access to two separate playstyles in a way that's never been seen before: they're tied to the time of day, meaning you never have to choose between them. Not outright, anyway.\nThe Blood of Dawnwalker is the kind of vampire RPG I've been craving since Vampyr. Instead of focusing on the moral implications of the vampiric condition, Rebel Wolves presents two equally strong power fantasies in one. It demonstrates a welcome evolution of vampirism in video games, showcasing the developer's goal of putting player choice center stage rather than asking us to trade might for the moral high ground yet again. Personally? I'm already sat.\nJust one bite\nAs a staunch fan of all things bloodsucker, the thing I'm most excited for Rebel Wolves to explore in Blood of Dawnwalker is vampire lore itself.\nFrom the process of turning to social politics, power dynamics, and the oppositional forces of good versus evil, there are many vampiric codes and conventions we come across in pop culture that largely reinforce each other. But Rebel Wolves is daring to do things a little differently, all in the name of reinforcing the game's arcane setting. In doing so, it paves the way for The Blood of Dawnwalker's novel approach to vampire RPG systems, whether it be combat, thirst, or morality.\nAs articulated by creative director Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz, The Blood of Dawnwalker takes place in the fictional Vale Sangora, a besieged corner of Eastern Europe where a plague-weakened human population has fallen to the might of vampires. It's a world brimming with magic and superstition, where skilled humans are able to channel ancient powers through runes and sigils carved directly into their own flesh. Meanwhile, vampires fight with \"claws, enhanced strength, supernatural agility, and dark powers\". As Coen, we get it all.\nWith his vampire side dormant by day, Coen uses a mix of sword-based melee combat alongside \"raw, ritual-based\" magic \"with dark, primordial origins\" to fight off foes, says Tomaszkiewicz. At night, he vamps out \u2013 and it's all about flashing your fangs. Already, The Blood of Dawnwalker sounds like a breath of fresh-out-the-coffin air as I embrace all parts of his psyche, not just the ascribed \"good,\" human half.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nThe Blood of Dawnwalker turns a universal truth on its head, one widely accepted in most video games: if a character in a game is plagued with vampirism, they must fight to retain their humanity \u2013 even if sometimes, there's good to be had in both.\nAn example of this is Coen's nocturnal health bar, which doubles up as his hunger meter to provide some great roleplaying potential. As shown in the gameplay demo on YouTube, players can choose whether to refill it segment by segment by drinking just a little from a few victims, or they can drain a single victim dry and kill them outright.\nDespite feeling like an ethical choice, it's really more about survival. Blood really is the life in The Blood of Dawnwalker, as even if you're playing a good guy, feeding is part of being a vampire. How do you manage that hunger? Well, that's up to you.\nDamned in damnation\nThis moral flexibility speaks to something I've long yearned for in RPGs. As much as I relish the opportunity to become a child of the night in video games, I'm used to being punished for it \u2013 even when there's little reason to be.\nA good example of this is how Don't Nod's Vampyr had me agonizing over whether to kill or spare the people of London, eternally chastised for craving some precious extra XP I'd earn by drinking the town dry. Why? Because \"vampire = bad,\" duh.\nIt's true that vampires have taken on various symbolic meanings over the years, most often representing a parasitic, invasive evil (moral or literal) that taints a person's soul and renders them irredeemable. But the literature student in me will always see Dracula and his brethren as a metaphor for otherness instead, with evil being a wholly subjective part of that othering. Are vampires born evil, or do some just have evilness thrust upon them?\nSadly, that question never gets truly answered in Vampyr. While I enjoyed the resource management side of the feeding system, especially given how it facilitates a lot of the game's side quest material, I was annoyed to find that adaptive difficulty stood in the way of achieving the ultimate vampire power fantasy.\nEven after embracing (or drinking, to put it bluntly) the whole city in one fell swoop to max out my level cap before heading into the boss battle \u2013 a move I curiously thought might save me the moral repercussions of doing so earlier in the game \u2013 my enemy still outranked me by a whole level point.\nIt felt like power was an illusion; even when I was my most powerful, the game wanted me to feel guilty about it. Because, again: human = good, and vampire = bad.\nMeanwhile in Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines and upcoming sequel Bloodlines 2, you are an all-out vampire and proud of it.\nI love the idea of choosing a clan and sticking with it, using your clan-specific archetypes and abilities to play the game your way, but it still makes for a restrictive experience to know you will be funneled into one way of getting things done for an entire RPG.\nAs far as half-vampires are concerned, I've seen them pop up in games before, but never have they been articulated so thoughtfully as in The Blood of Dawnwalker. Oddly enough, I do see a lot of similarities in how BloodRayne and Dawnwalker treat half-vampirism as empowering rather than morally enfeebling, even if they strike dissimilar tones.\nTo put it bluntly, Coen is a dawnwalker whose playstyle changes with the rising moon, while dhampir Rayne is a leather and latex-clad Catwoman-bloodsucker hybrid who struts her way through a beat-'em-up franchise with the odd bit of obnoxiously horny biting thrown in for healing. Good for her.\nThat similarity is important. Coen and Rayne both use blood as healing aides, though Coen seems far less uh, excited by it in the gameplay I've seen so far. Still, by leaning into the \"anti-sexy\" vampire trend as popularized by Nosferatu (Rebel Wolves' vampires more closely resemble The Master over Edward Cullen), Dawnwalker manages to present the same pros and cons of half-vampirism as shown in BloodRayne. Put a gun or blade in their hands, and Coen and Rayne are formidable warriors. But they're also vampire assassins and can use their supernaturality to gain an advantage. They can be both things at once, and the player doesn't get an ethics chat about it.\nZeroing back in on The Blood of Dawnwalker specifically, I'm loving how Coen's variable playstyles challenge the perceived rigidity and forced morality of vampirism in RPGs. Whether I end up choosing to align with one side more than the other seems irrelevant as far as combat utility is concerned. The time of day governs Coen's skillset, not my moral compass, so perhaps I don't need to feel bad about being powerful for a change in The Blood of Dawnwalker.\nCheck out all the best RPGs to play while you wait.\nJasmine is a staff writer at GamesRadar+.

      "text": "Baldur's Gate 3's Dark Urge is the wickedest I've ever felt in a video game\nOpinion | Being bad pays off, but are the sacrifices worth it?\nI royally screwed up Baldur's Gate 3 by playing as a Dark Urge. Not because I don't enjoy being unnecessarily evil in games \u2013 on the contrary, it's one of my favorite things to do. But as I stride into Moonrise Towers with nothing but three companions by my side, staring down about 90 enemies in total, I can almost feel my whole party's knees begin to buckle. I'm about to learn the hard way that there is a big, big reason developer Larian Studios suggests against doing exactly what I currently am: playing Dark Urge on your very first time.\nBeing bad feels oh-so good at times in this game, especially when you get rewarded for it with unique gear, a behemoth form, and even your own butler. But in Baldur's Gate 3, the consequences can be truly dire. My Dark Urge playthrough is the first time I've ever felt truly rotten to my absolute core while playing an RPG, the first time I've stared at my screen agape at the outcomes of some of my heinous actions. It's true: I killed some powerful allies at the behest of my Dark Urge, and all I got were some lousy items. And guess what? I'd do it all again.\nWarning: Spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3 until the end of Act 2\nNice guys finish last\nCheck out our Baldur's Gate 3 review and see what GR+ makes of it.\nI'm plagued by a sickening sense that maybe I'm not cut out for the bad guy life after all. Few games make you face that truth quite like Baldur's Gate 3. The Dark Urge version of the main campaign is proof of the writers' sheer prowess, creating a playable villain that feels alternately fun and horrifying as you move through the story.\nFor starters, the game is very good at making me forget my conscience. Choosing the nastiest options feels quite easy at times \u2013 logical, fluid, natural to my character. I give in to my Urge and execute the sweet cleric, Isobel, protector of the Last Light Inn and a potential major player for Act 2's endgame. This is something I do entirely on a whim, just to see what might happen. I'm playing Dark Urge, after all; I owe it to myself to see it through.\nThat is, of course, until I'm reminded of said conscience with a rip-roaring punch to the gut. Killing Isobel was easy enough, especially being a four-versus-one fight. It's not until I go toe-to-toe with her dear old dad, Ketheric Thorm, that I find a note on his corpse. \"Papa, love you. Iz,\" it reads. Ouch.\nIt's small touches like these that show just how lovingly the writers have penned every outcome of its frankly baffling, sprawling array of choices. Murdering Isobel and everyone at the Last Light Inn \u2013 including potential companion Jaheira \u2013 is certainly not what you want to do in a good playthrough. But as a Dark Urge, Baldur's Gate 3 can still feel rewarding when you do the bleakest of things.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nThe boy is mine\nI'm usually quite happy to indulge my Dark Urge, but I draw the line when little goblin butler Sceleteritas Fel tries to get me to off my own beau. I'll admit it: Wyll was not my first choice when it comes to matters of my cold, evil heart, but since I had to kill Karlach's infernal mechanic and she's technically never going to be able to touch me at all, I figure why the hell not? A Dark Urge monk like myself can do a lot worse than the Blade of Frontiers. Plus, having a devil for a boyfriend sounds kind of badass.\nWhen Sceleritas comes to visit at the dead of night and tells me I'm about to kill my favorite companion, I decide I'm having none of that. Fancy cape be damned, I'm not about to murder the only person in this entire camp who actually finds me decent. What happens next is one of the most stressful, heart-in-my-throat sequences of any game I've ever played.\nI wake Wyll up and tell him of Sceleritas' prophecy: that if I fall asleep, I will try to kill him. I need to land a series of high-stakes saving throws in order to keep from doing so, holding my Urge back lest it consume me and tear out his throat. Wyll soothes me all the while, and for a moment, I consider that maybe his smug one-eyed face really would look better torn off. His annoying nature is somehow a part of his charm, though, so I keep fighting it. The next few moments pass feverishly as I claw my way back from the brink before finally falling asleep.\nI wake up the next day, and Wyll is alive. I am alive, Scratch the dog is alive, and so is everyone else. Well, everyone except Isobel Thorm. And Alfira, the passionate tiefling bard I tore apart in cold blood. And everyone I had originally rescued at Emerald Grove in Act 1 and was later forced to kill at Last Light. Still, I'm proud of myself for not gutting my boyfriend.\nBy holding myself back, even just that once, the layers of complexity added to my Dark Urge feel monumentally important, and that's a reward in itself. Will I reject my bloodthirsty nature going ahead, or is it time to embrace my role as a true-born Slayer? I'm not yet sure. Some things in Baldur's Gate 3 are worth killing for, but the writers never let you forget that balance is the key to any good story.\nJasmine is a staff writer at GamesRadar+.

      "text": "Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2: Everything we know so far\nAt long last, the best vampire RPG is finally getting a sequel as VTMB2 gears up for a 2025 release\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is officially coming our way this October, with the reveal of a concrete release date during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025. The showcase gave us a shiny new trailer which once again teased the upcoming RPG which will take us Seattle as a customizable elder vampire called Phyre who's awakens after a century-long slumber.\nThe bloodsucking sequel to Troika's 2004 cult classic vampire RPG has been a long time coming, with its first reveal dating back to 2019. With development changing hands, Still Wakes the Deep developer The Chinese Room is leading the project, and thanks to gameplay, hands-on impressions, and more trailers, we're steadily getting a better idea of what's in store. It's certainly shaping up to be one of the most intriguing new game for 2025 coming our way this October.\nOne things for sure: exciting times are ahead for vampire fans everywhere. Not only do we have Bloodlines 2 to look forward to this year, but there's more vampy goodness to come in the future, too, with the likes of The Blood of Dawnwalker in 2026 and The Duskbloods. But as we await the arrival of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, read on below to find a helpful breakdown of everything we know so far about the new vampire adventure.\nVampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 release date confirmed for 2025\nThe Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 release date is set for Ocotober 21, 2025.\nBack in March The Chinese Room's announced an amended release date window, which pushed the vampire RPG back from its previous \"early 2025\" launch window into an unspecified \"October 2025\" time frame. But thanks to a new trailer which dropped during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 (which you can watch above), we at long last learned of the concreate release date.\nBloodlines 2 has been met with delays before, with it previously scheduled to be released in Fall 2024. Explaining the decision to release in October 2025, the developer stated that \"Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room are committed to delivering this game, and we believe that ensuring great technical quality is more important than sticking to a specific date\".\nIn the past, The Chinese Room also said that the extra time following an earlier delay was being used to expand the game's story, revealing that it will have \"twice as many endings\" as the first Bloodlines. Exciting stuff!\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nVampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 platforms\nIn terms of Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 platforms, we expect it to launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X in 2025.\nIt is not expected to launch on last-gen consoles (via Gematsu), with the publisher having scrapped that idea when the project changed hands to a new developer in 2020. Sad news for PS4 and Xbox One owners, but it's already an improvement on the computer-only restrictions of the first Bloodlines game back in 2004.\nVampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 trailer\nThe Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 trailer above was released in November 2024 and shows us a very, brief look at the game in action. The clip introduces us to some characters, and we get to see a sneak peek at combat systems as well. There are not a ton of story details here, but the short clip does demonstrate the dark, gritty world of city-dwelling vampires that you'd expect. So, we're excited to see more of this world in the future!\nVampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 delay\nThe original Bloodlines 2 was intended to launch in 2019 from Killing Floor 2 developer, Hardsuit Labs, shortly after publisher Paradox acquired the IP in 2015. Following two delays in 2019 and 2020 respectively, as well as roles being reshuffled in the dev team, Paradox announced in 2021 that Bloodlines 2 had been delayed \"indefinitely\". Hardsuit Labs was then removed from the project, with no mention of a replacement.\nIt was a relief to see a sign of life two years later when Paradox released fresh production screenshots in June 2023. There was no mention of which studio was actually developing the game until September 2023, though, with a post on the Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 Steam page revealing Everybody's Gone to the Rapture and Still Wakes the Deep developer The Chinese Room as the official project lead. Since then, the information has been coming in steady drip-feeds of dev interviews and sneak peeks in the lead up to launch this October.\nVampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 developer\nVampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 is being developed by British studio The Chinese Room.\nStudio design director Alex Skidmore penned the Steam announcement on September 20, 2023, introducing the developer as an \"award-winning studio focused on telling grounded, believable and rich stories - these are the traditions behind our ground-breaking games in our portfolio, like Dear Esther and the internationally acclaimed Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.\"\nSkidmore's post revealed that The Chinese Room has been working on Bloodlines 2 since 2020, alongside a second \"narrative-focused\" project, Still Wakes the Deep. \"Still Wakes the Deep builds on The Chinese Room's heritage, and Bloodlines 2 is about looking to the future for our games, taking a big leap forward into the action role-playing genre while bringing our narrative expertise to bear.\"\nThe studio recently announced it has now parted ways with parent company Sumo Digital after seven years, and now operates as an independent studio.\n\"This management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property, but also to partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with our vision,\" director Ed Daly said.\nVampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 protagonist\nThe Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 protagonist is Phyre, an Elder vampire (also known as the Nomad), whose newly awoken from a centuries-long slumber to find the city has left them behind. Once they awaken, they will have a series of questions to answer - such as what's causing their lack of strength, or why their body is marked with arcane sigils.\nThe Nomad will be a highly-customizable main character, with their gender, appearance, and vampire clan all down to player choice, with an overarching narrative to pull the pieces together. \"Choices and conversations (even outfits!) shape how the environment and characters react to Phyre, changing how the story unfolds, \" writes The Chinese Room (via Steam).\nIn a dev diary, we got an expanded explanation of our playable Elder writing: \"The Nomad is a legend amongst Kindred. Their name has been whispered for four hundred years - of their presence in revolutions, on battlefields, at slaughters, and at the fall of Princes. Are they escaping these situations, causing them, or taking joy in red wrath and ruin? Whatever the truth, they are a catalyst - when they appear, the world of the Kindred will be irrevocably changed.\"\nThe post also went on to clarify that your status will affect relationships in your game. \"In our story, different characters have different beliefs about the Nomad and their history. While these events may not have an immediate effect on the game world, they will affect how our protagonist is treated.\"\n\"We have deliberately left it up to the player to decide how Phyre treats these stories and their legend, and how much they tell other characters about their past - and indeed, which stories they tell.\"\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 story\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2's story will follow Phyre in modern-day Seattle, which is on the brink of war.\nOne of the most important Bloodlines 2 story elements is bound to be the vampire clans. As in the TTRPG, the clan you pick will dictate Phyre's skills, disciplines, and traits, which could affect how you play the game and interact with NPCs around you. The developer stated that there will be \"four playable clans\" to choose from, each outlined below, when the game launches.\nThere will be one more added in a post-launch DLC, and a sixth via a \"unique, standalone DLC\" sometime this year in 2025. We also know that Phyre will share the main character spotlight with a Thin-Blood vampire named Fabian, described by the developer as being \"inside Phyre.\" Sharing a peculiar \"bond\" with them, Fabian will act as Phyre's guide through the modern world, giving them access to information that a recently comatose Elder might not ordinarily have known, thanks to their long and restless slumber.\nThe extended gameplay reveal shows Fabian's mental bond with Phyre as something akin to a voice in her head, though we aren't quite sure how he came to be there.\nIn 2025 we also learned that the story of Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 will introduce some more human characters, who are part of a group known as The Hunters. These Hunters will be a thorn in your side during the upcoming story as they serve as a black ops arm of the Information and Awareness Office for the government (I.A.O.).\nThat means, your dealings and choices will likely be monitored and, going by the group's name, you'll also be stalked on the regular. The Hunters' leader is a new character called Agent Barker, who is leading \"the I.A.O. in its mission to investigate the Blankbody presence in Seattle,\" according to a recently posted dev diary.\nWe also know that these enemies will be packing heat in terms of weapons. We are talking military-grade equipment that even a vampire should be worried about. So, don't expect an easy ride when it comes to your new enemies. We're keen to see how The Hunters will fit into the main story of the game and what part they'll play in your ongoing quest for influence over the supernatural world.\nVampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 gameplay\nEarly Bloodlines 2 gameplay shows us that the game will play out from a first-person perspective, with conversations and feeding animations zooming out to the third-person.\nThis was revealed in a recent extended deep-dive, showcasing an early mission sequence where a female Brujah-clan Phyre infiltrates a warehouse to investigate a strange mark that has appeared on their hand. Confronting Nosferatu vampire Willem, the reveal shows Phyre wielding her super-strength as a Brujah vampire to punch and feed her way through Willem's confusing illusion puzzle on a mission to get more intel out of him.\nWe get to see more of the feeding mechanics in Bloodlines 2 in the above gameplay reveal, involving pushing down on both console controller triggers when biting into a victim. The main combat we've seen so far pertains to the Brujah's fists-first approach, with a targeting mechanic that looks reminiscent of Red Dead Redemption 2's Dead Eye.\nAccording to studio design director Alex Skidmore, \"Bloodlines 2 is designed with a balance of roleplaying game and adventure story. A compelling and rich plot you'd expect from an adventure game, but with RPG agency allowing you to act out your vampire fantasy. Something about it does look reminiscent of Arkane's Dishonored series, a reference cited by the developer in the accompanying Steam post.\nThe Chinese Room says it has reworked this approach, going for a more nuanced vampire roleplay experience, so when Bloodlines 2 releases, we should expect \"an action experience where players feel confident, almost trolling the enemies with their [vampire] disciplines.\" This suggests that, as in the first Bloodlines game, our chosen vampire clan and its associated strengths and weaknesses will inform how combat, feeding, and exploration works.\nIn another YouTube video featuring gameplay and dev interview footage, we see Bloodlines 2's voiced protagonist Phyre having a conversation with an NPC, this time showing both characters in animated third-person close-ups. \"We put in a rule that the non-combat gameplay should be about something only a vampire could do; keep it aspirational,\" says The Chinese Room. We see this in the extended gameplay reveal embedded above, where Phyre uses her vampiric senses to solve a puzzle in an abandoned warehouse by way of smashing through hidden gramophones to break Willem's illusion.\nOutside of the three dialogue trees shown in the recent Bloodlines 2 gameplay reveal, we've yet to see much more of the game's RPG mechanics at work. As well as those all-important vampire Disciplines, we know to expect four core features no matter which Kindred clan you choose: feeding, telekinesis, vampiric senses, and the voice of thin-blood vampire Fabien listening in on all Phyre does.\nStealth also comes into play, and it's left up to you to decide who you want to pick a fight with. As our features editor Andy Brown explains after playing the upcoming adventure, it does have some Dishonored vibes to it in terms of how it plays. For more, be sure to read our Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 hands-on preview.\nVampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 clans\nThe Chinese Room has announced that the first four playable vampire clans in Bloodlines 2 will be Brujha, Tremere, Banu Haqim, and Ventrue. There will also be two new clans added in post-launch DLC, but here's a breakdown of the main four:\n- Brujah: Brutal melee-based combat. Rebellious, passionate, and very good with their fists, the Brujah are a clan of punks and outcasts who making use of their immense physical strength to get their points across.\n- Tremere: Magic-based combat. The Tremere clan's pursuit of knowledge has given them notoriety as the clan of warlocks and blood mages, as seem in the announcement video where the player picks up and throws an opponent using telekinetic abilities. They can control their own blood and that of their foes.\n- Banu Haqim: Stealth and assassination. The Banu Haqim are the lawbringing clan that thirsts for the blood of other vampires, and uses a strict code of conduct to help them enact justice on wrongdoers. The developer references Blade and Angel as two pop culture vampires who might align themselves with the Banu Haqim characteristic of being \"a hunter of hunters driven by strong principles.\"\n- Ventrue: Mind control combat and high defence. Clan Ventrue's Disciplines allow them to psychologically overcome enemies with their Presence or Dominate them. As the self-proclaimed blue bloods of vampire society, Vantrues are often associated with status, wealth, and hold high positions in the Camarilla (vampire congress).\nWe know that The Chinese Room is targeting a visceral and immersive combat experience in Bloodlines 2, one \"that can compete with modern titles,\" says the developer in Dev Diary 7. The teams aims to do this through three core gameplay styles: Strategic Stalker, Action Brawler, and Narrative Adventurer.\nEach of the three playstyles will be pertinent to one of the above vampire clans in Bloodlines 2, dictating how your rendition of Phyre moves through and interacts with the world around them.\nStrategic Stalker speaks to a more stealth-centric gameplay style that \"gives you time to prepare what Discipline power you\u2019d like to use and when. Once your plan is ready, summoning the powers of the blood, sneaking up on an enemy, distracting them, feeding on them before a fight breaks out or hit and run tactics are options for people who love to play this way.\" This sounds like a go-to for the Banu Haqim and Tremere clans.\nAction Brawler is the more combat-heavy gameplay style for those who wish to go in fangs and fists first. \"Any Clan can brawl but this is where the Brujah shine,\" says project creative director Alex Skidmore. \"Their powers are aimed at dominating close combat. References for this style are action-brawling games like the God of War series, Shadow of Mordor and Elden Ring. It is about being in the centre of the brawl and using your abilities to control the crowd so you can deliver as much damage as possible.\"\nFinally, Narrative Adventurer seems like a gameplay style for those who want to emulate the feeling of the original Bloodlines game. In short: \"You can still enjoy exciting battles without having to delve too deeply into the combat mechanics if things like characters and story are more important to you.\"\nIn a Tremere highlight dev diary posted on Steam, The Chinese Room gives us a closer look at how these different clans will play out in the RPG. Among the skill tree detailing the various ways that your chosen clan (in this case, Tremere) can level up their powers, giving us a closer look at how each vampire clan's skills can overlap with their combat potential as listed above. We've also seen the Brujah ability tree in past dev diaries, so it's looking like this RPG element will be standardized across the clans.\nVampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 choices\nThe first thing players will have to work out is their Nomad. Are they a legendary warrior? A curious traveler? Or a desperate survivor, fleeing disaster to disaster to avoid their foes? According to the dev diary posted in January 2025, \"Once this is chosen, we branch out into further options \u2014 each unique to that choice \u2014 which both refine roleplay and drill further into that initial theme with your motivation.\"\nBeing a choice-driven RPG, The Chinese Room has also given us a closer look at Bloodlines 2's dialogue and skill tree system.\n\"We initially toyed with representing our dialogue choices in summary, to make the intention of the branch abundantly clear and lean harder into our \u2018strategic\u2019 approach to roleplay,\" writes Sarah Longthorne, TCR's Senior Narrative Designer and Writer in a Steam post.\n\"However, this quickly revealed itself as the wrong direction\u2014and not just because you guys (rightly) said so. Getting into the weeds of our conversations, I found that the choices on offer felt the same when viewed from above, even when the content was entirely different\u2014zoom too far out, and you lose fine detail, which is where your flavor lives.\n\"So we settled on a compromise, the tried-and-true next best thing: (carefully) paraphrased speech.\" This paraphrased speech, according to Longthorne, will employ \"Bloodlines 1\u2019s approach of marrying strategy with morality. It's the ideal direction, and it\u2019s the one we\u2019ve chosen.\"\nBy mapping out player choice from the perspective of what we are saying versus the tone, manner, or blatant moral alignment of what those words might communicate, our dialogue choices will allow a shrewd Kindred to play one of three wise: by \"throwing their weight around\" as an Elder vampire, stroking their enemies' egos, or by turning the tables back on them.\n\"Perhaps you achieve this straightforwardly, by responding to questions with more questions, or indirectly by choosing words that might provoke a reply, a telling outburst,\" suggests Longthorne. \"Your options are not always strictly limited to these three approaches (we haven\u2019t forgotten about Clan-specific options, for instance), and how each approach manifests will not always be uniform.\"\nUltimately, the goal here is \"subjective interpretation, both by you and others. Unless clearly indicated, we will never assume the intent for your choice on your behalf. Strategy or sincerity\u2014that much is up to you.\"\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 pre-order\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 pre-orders are now live. Following the news of an official release date, we also got confirmation that you can pre-purchase the new RPG across all platforms, with Standard, Deluxe, and Premium editions.\nThe Deluxe edition features a Santa Monica Memories Cosmetic Pack which includes a sarcophagus, portrait, a neon clan collection, and a stop sign. The Premium edition comes with the Shadows and Silk Clan pack which brings with it the playable two playable clans, including the Lasombra who can shroud themselves in darkness and command the shadow, and the Toreader who can captive and sway hearts with their artistic charm.\nRegardless of which edition you pick up, you'll also get a pre-order bonus of a \"Bloodlines Nostalgia Jukebox\" featuring music from Rik Shaffer.\nCheck out our lists of all the upcoming PS5 games and upcoming Xbox Series X games for more exciting titles heading our way in the near future.\nJasmine is a staff writer at GamesRadar+.

      "text": "Red Dead Redemption 2 100% completion guide: What you need to do to 'complete' Rockstar's epic\nBecause you know that you need to 100% complete Red Dead 2 someday, even if it takes you hundreds of glorious hours\nIf your target is reaching that elusive Red Dead Redemption 2 100% completion stat, then buckle up my friend because you're in it for the long haul and reaching the end of the extensive main story is just the tip of the iceberg. If you want to achieve this epic milestone then you'll have to beat a wide selection of challenges, seek out a sackful of collectibles, hunt down every legendary animal and fish, and much more on top!\nTo assist you on this epic journey, we've put together this list of all the various tasks required to attain that Red Dead Redemption 2 100% completion stat. Just make sure to resist the temptation to use any Red Dead Redemption 2 cheats along the way, as the progress you make after activating them won't count and you'll be locked out of any future trophies or achievements.\nCheck out our video below for some essential Red Dead Redemption 2 tips:\nMissions and Events\nMissions - 107\nComplete all story missions. Check out our complete Red Dead Redemption 2 guide for the Gold Medal requirements, though these aren't needed for 100%.\nStrangers - 10\nYou'll need to find and complete 10 Stranger missions across the Red Dead Redemption 2 map - indicated by grey question mark icons - and complete them. There are more than 10 Stranger missions available in the world, but you only need to do this many to tick off this section of the Red Dead Redemption 2 100% completion guide. If you're looking for help, these are the best Red Dead Redemption 2 strangers.\nBounties - 5\nBring in five sheriff's bounties. Start the missions by collecting Bounty posters, which are marked on your map.\nChance Encounters - 25\nFor this section it's all about engaging in 25 Chance Encounters, which are those emergent stories that you'll run across as you explore the world. They'll appear as little grey dots on the map, and you'll usually hear them shouting for help as you run past.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nBushwhacked - 1\nThis one is quite interesting as it requires you to encounter one - yes, just one - Gang Ambush. The task reads that \"Dutch's gang isn't the only one East of the Grizzlies. Others are out there and they don't take too kindly to new competition or old rivalry.\" Better keep your finger on that trigger.\nGang Hideouts - 6\nThere are six remaining gang hideouts where the last few outlaws are holed up. You've got to find them, and capture the hideouts - one way or another.\nCollectables\nPoints of Interest - 1\nEvery now and then it pays to stop and pay attention to your surroundings, and that's exactly what this one needs. Find just one of the many Points of Interest in Red Dead 2's world and you'll have ticked this one off, probably by accident. This is a gorgeous world after all.\nGraves of Fallen Companions - 9\nThere are a total of nine graves around the map to mark your fallen companions, and you'll need to visit them all. Follow our Red Dead Redemption 2 graves locations guide for all their locations, but you won't be able to finish this task until the Epilogue.\nCigarette Card Sets - 1\nAlthough there are actually 12 complete cigarette card sets to find in the world of Red Dead Redemption 2, you only need to complete one to tick of this section of the 100% Completion Guide. Easy, right? We've got the full details in our Red Dead Redemption 2 cigarette cards locations guide.\nDinosaur Bones - 30\nOnce you've found the Stranger mission involving paleontologist Deborah MacGuiness, this dinosaur bones achievement will pop up. The problem is though, that there are 30 dinosaur bones hidden across the map, and there's no easy way to find them - unless you use our Red Dead Redemption 2 dinosaur bones locations guide, that is.\nLegendary Fish - 13\nAnother collectable connected to a Stranger mission is the Legendary Fish. Jeremy Gill will ask you to find 13 Red Dead Redemption 2 Legendary Fish, which you'll have to mail to him in order to help complete his collection.\nExotic Item Quests - 6\nIn Chapter 4, you'll meet a Stranger named Algernon Wasp, who will give you a number of lists of exotic items to find.\nRock Carvings - 10\nSomewhere in Big Valley is a rather odd fellow called Francis Sinclair. He needs your help locating 10 strange Red Dead Redemption 2 rock carvings (or rock faces as they're called in the Log) that are hidden across the world. Apparently when you locate them every one \"maybe all will become clear\".\nHunting Requests - 5\nYou'll find hunting requests displayed in train stations and post offices, and must complete five of them here. Note that you won't be able to take on the fifth and final request until at least Epilogue 1 in the story.\nTreasure Hunter - 1\nYou'll find various Treasure Hunters around the world, who will give you maps to various buried loot. But you'll only need to follow the clues to complete one Treasure Hunter chain in order to tick this off your list.\nDreamcatchers - 20\nHidden away in the branches of the trees of Red Dead's world are rather eerily beautiful Dreamcatchers. There are 20 in total to find, and thankfully they glow gold in your Eagle Eye vision lurking amongst the foliage. Find all 20 Red Dead Redemption 2 dreamcatchers, note their positions and apparently there's an Ancient Secret to discover.\nCompendium\nAnimals - 50\nThere are actually 178 animal breeds to discover across the Wild West, from birds and rabbits, to horses and cattle, and everything else in between. But for this particular section of the Red Dead Redemption 2 100% Completion guide, you only need to discover 50, which you can do by 'studying' any new ones you come across in the world. Check out our Red Dead Redemption 2 animal locations guide for help finding different species.\nEquipment - 10\nFrom your camera to your binoculars, Arthur Morgan loves his gadgets. And it turns out you'll need to obtain 10 different pieces of equipment to satisfy this particular requirement, so get collecting. An outlaw is more than the gun on his back after all.\nFish - 10\nTurns out that along with 50 different animal species, you'll also need to discover 10 individual fish types in order to tick this one off your list. Just prepare yourself for getting your chaps wet.\nGangs - 6\nAlthough Red Dead 2 is set at a point in history when outlaws are dying out, there are still plenty of rival gangs to encounter. Six, in fact. You'll need to get up in the grills of all of them, and you can track your progress using the Gang section of your Compendium too.\nHorses - 10\nOh, I take it back, horses don't count towards your animal discoveries. They're a whole separate shebang. Discover 10 of the hooved beasts on your travels, and you won't have to worry about studying a horse ever again.\nPlants - 20\nAlong with the animals, there are herbs and other plants to collect and discover across the map. You'll need to discover 20 (out of a possible 43) to complete this section.\nWeapons - 48\nAlthough there are actually 59 weapons to check out in the game, you only have to use 48 for this section, which means you can pander to your own gameplay preferences a bit. You can check out how many you've discovered and which ones in the Weapons sections of the Compendium.\nPlayer\nReach maximum Health, Stamina and Dead Eye\nThis one pretty much does what it says on the tin, as you just need to max out your health, stamina and dead eye to tick this off. You can do this by just playing the game, as doing various activities - like hunting, running, and fighting - will all slowly increase all three stats until you reach the max.\nHorse Bonding\nBrush, feed, pat and generally ride around with your horse until you manage to max out the Bonding Level with your steed.\nChallenges - 9\nFor this one, you better get prepared to do a bit of grinding, because you'll need to complete all nine Challenges. That's all the stuff listed in the Challenges section of your game, including Bandit, Explorer, Gambler, Horseman, Master Hunter and more, all of which have multiple levels to them. Good luck, and if you want help with any of them (other than Explorer Challenges which just involve finding treasures) then check out our guides:\n- Red Dead Redemption 2 Bandit Challenges guide\n- Red Dead Redemption 2 Gambler Challenges guide\n- Red Dead Redemption 2 Herbalist Challenges guide\n- Red Dead Redemption 2 Horseman Challenges guide\n- Red Dead Redemption 2 Master Hunter Challenges guide\n- Red Dead Redemption 2 Sharpshooter Challenges guide\n- Red Dead Redemption 2 Survivalist Challenges guide\n- Red Dead Redemption 2 Weapons Expert Challenges guide\nMiscellaneous\nShacks - 5\nThere are several shacks that you can find in the game that are described by Rockstar as \"unremarkable structures, but each with their own strange secret to hide\". You'll need to find five of them to unlock this task.\nLegendary Animals - 5\nWhy discover just any old animal when there are, wait for it, legendary animals to be found, and hunted, and skinned of course, too. You'll need to track down and kill five of these Red Dead Redemption 2 legendary animals to cross this off. Why not make a hat of them while you're there.\nTable Games - 4\nA cheeky way to win some easy cash in Red Dead 2 is to do a bit of gambling, and helpfully it also contributes towards your 100% completion. You'll need to play one game each of Poker, Dominoes, Five Finger Fillet and Blackjack in order to complete this section, but that should be easy enough, especially as table game locations are marked on your map.\nRanters, Ravers, and Campaigners - 5\nAside from your Chance Encounters, Strangers and main story missions, there are also some oddities that you'll find loitering in your world that fall under this Ranters, Ravers, and Campaigners header. You'll need to find and interact with five of these characters to complete this part of the guide.\nBath - 1\nPretty much self-explanatory this one, but in order to 100% complete Red Dead Redemption 2 you need to take a bath. You stinky Pete. A number of 'reputable establishments' let you take a long hot soak to rest your aching bones and scrub away all that dirt and debauchery. All you need to do is take one single bath in all your time in the Wild, Wild West and you'll never have to think about getting clean again.\nShow - 1\nOver in the Imperial Theatre in Blackwater, or the Fontana Theatre in Saint Denis you can catch a show, which will satisfy this particular requirement of the 100% completion guide. Or you can check out J.J. Riggins' Traveling Magic Lantern Show in Valentine if you want to get this section done quick.\nTheater - 1\nSlightly different from the shows mentioned above, if you head to Saint Denis' Theatre Raleur, you can watch a vaudeville show, which is described as for \"the curious and the degenerate\". Sounds amazing. You'll be able to watch escape artists, fire eaters and snake dancers galore, and you only need to do that once to tick this off the list.\nRecipes - 6\nEating, drinking, swigging tonics and more is just part of your daily survival in Red Dead Redemption 2. But you don't always have to buy them or swipe them off a corpse. You can get recipes and make them yourself at your various camps. For this section you have to craft one cooking recipe, one tonic, one type of ammunition, one hunting item, one horse care item, and one weapon.\nRobberies - 4\nAs an outlaw we all thrive on the thieving and robbing, but it turns out so does this list. Complete one coach robbery, one home robbery, one shop robbery, and one train robbery for this section.\nSam Loveridge is the Brand Director and former Global Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar.

      "text": "The 25 best video game stories to play right now\nThe best video game stories of all time, from Mass Effect 2's intergalactic soap opera to Life is Strange's affecting drama\nThe best game stories can be found in all kinds of adventures, from some best RPGs with companions that you won't soon forget, to some of the best open-world games that take you on memorable sprawling journeys with plenty of unexpected twists and turns.\nOver the years, there have been some truly fantastic stories explored in the world of video games, to those that tug at your heartstrings to action-packed plots, and so much more. With narrative-driven experiences that let you shape the outcome, to some of the best single-player games that will keep you hooked, there's not shortage of fantastic games out there to explore if you're looking to get stuck into a good story.\nHappily, we have many new games to look forwad to that will no doubt shake up our selection, with the likes of Ghost of Yotei, The Outer Worlds 2, and much more. But while we await fresh arrivals, join us as we take you through the very best game stories around.\nThe top 25 best story games to play in 2025 are...\n25. Split Fiction\nDeveloper: Hazelight Studios\nReleased: 2025\nPlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S\nSplit Fiction is one of the best games of 2025, and takes you on a story that'll make you want to hug something as soon as you put the controller down. Developed by co-op masterminds Hazelight Studios, you and another player step into the shoes of two aspiring writers (Zoe and Mio) who end up in a machine that is trying to extract all their ideas. Together, you'll have to navigate each other's stories, uncovering present and past traumas, and help each other as you try to escape the greedy intentions of Rader Publishing.\nSplit Fiction's story is a thing of beauty that captures how art is often a tool to escape reality. As you fly dragons, face robots, and dance in an ape conga line, you'll see how Zoe and Mio's personal history influences their stories. A story about escaping a machine morphs into one about friendship, healing, and brutal truths. It's an amazing game, and one that you and your player two won't soon forget. Discover more in our Split Fiction review.\n24. Final Fantasy 6\nDeveloper: Square Enix\nReleased: 1994\nPlatforms: PC, PS4, Switch, Android, iOS\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nWhile later Final Fantasy titles improved the graphics, the plot never got better than in the sixth entry. Final Fantasy 6 tells a sprawling tale about the death of magic at the hands of unethical progress, and it has one of the biggest ensemble casts this side of War & Peace. It allows players to see any of a dozen characters as a fulfilling lead, and all would work in that context.\nMoments like an impromptu opera performance, the discovery of hidden lineage, or a heroic sacrifice are sprinkled throughout the game, but it's the bad guy that really steals the show. Kefka is one of the most detestable villains we've ever met, and the script does an amazing job of building up the heartless bastard. If Final Fantasy 6 is actually Kefka's tale, then it's a well-told one indeed. Get nostalgic in our Final Fantasy VI Advance (GBA) review.\n23. Undertale\nDeveloper: Toby Fox\nReleased: 2015\nPlatforms: PC, Xbox One, PS4, Switch\nUndertale is a unique game. There are monsters and goat people, and magic. But there's also a touching exercise in empathy (or the lack thereof). It's a challenge to condense the very strange story into one or two lines, but the most important thing to know about Undertale is that, beneath its peculiar, scrappy surface, its heart is made of pure sweetness.\nOne of the most powerful abilities in video game story-telling is how the player's actions can impact the narrative. Some games have used that amount of self-directed choice to reach for profundity, only to fall short. Undertale stands out for its many alternate endings, each of which manages to pack an emotional punch.\n22. Chrono Trigger\nDeveloper: Square Enix\nReleased: 1995\nPlatforms: PC, Android, iOS\nTime travel doesn't have the best track record as a narrative tool. In Chrono Trigger, though, the device shines as a source of storytelling finesse. The game starts simply enough at a town festival, but soon, the unassuming Crono and his friends are thrown into a massive adventure where he makes friends with cavemen, cursed knights, and robots searching for humanity. And you find a way to connect to all of them. The ever-shifting world Chrono travels has much to teach about the human condition.\nTechnology may change, but people always have the same capacity for love, greed, devotion, hate, and honor, no matter the era. And the storytellers knew when to create quiet moments to let the players get close enough to see some characters in a whole new light. Keeping track of timelines might be complicated, but the characters' motivations never were. Read our Chrono Trigger review for more.\n21. GTA 5\nDeveloper: Rockstar Games\nReleased: 2013\nPlatforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S\nThe most subversive story Rockstar has ever told in GTA is also the series' best. GTA 5 is really hard to pigeonhole. At times, it's a wisecracking take on Michael Mann's Heat \u2013 those headline scores are incredible. Most of the time, though, this Los Santos yarn is way too hard to pin down\u2026 and that's a compliment. Thanks to its innovative character-swapping gameplay, GTA 5 lets you live three very distinct lives over the course of a single campaign.\nSuch is the quality of the voice acting and mission structure you'll find yourself subconsciously role-playing whoever you think Franklin and co. should be. Presented as miserable and remorseful, Michael isn't the guy you do drive-by shootouts with. Ditto Franklin. Knowing and loyal, you want to actively limit the damage you do when the game puts you in the role of the young carjacker. And that's the genius of Trevor. A fully-fledged psychopath, played with wonderful glee by Steven Ogg, GTA finally has a vehicle for its frenzied bloodbaths in the form of an unrepentant character who couldn\u2019t care less about ludonarrative dissonance. Learn more in our Grand Theft Auto 5 review.\n20. Horizon Zero Dawn\nDeveloper: Guerrilla Games\nReleased: 2017\nPlatforms: PS4, PC\nThe story of Horizon Zero Dawn is fantastic on a number of levels. Firstly, it's the creation of the team over at Guerrilla Games, which is famous for the Killzone series, games that have never been heralded for their storylines. It's also fantastic because it has a female protagonist in Aloy, with strong themes of femininity and matriarchal societies.\nThirdly, it actually creates a vision of the end of the world that isn't terrible. Quite the mean feat, eh? But at its heart, this is a story of sci-fi robot dinosaurs, tribal humanity, and a kick-ass heroine. Of course, once you've ventured through Aloy's first adventure, it's well worth checking out Horizon Forbidden West, too. Find out more in our Horizon Zero Dawn review.\n19. Life is Strange/Life is Strange: Before the Storm\nDeveloper: Dontnod Entertainment/Deck Nine\nReleased: 2015/2017\nPlatforms: PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, Switch\nIt seems almost mean to bundle both these brilliant episodic titles into one entry for the best game stories, but they're best experienced as one package. The original Life is Strange tells the story of Max Caulfield and her friend Chloe Price facing the perils of adolescence and an impending town-destroying storm. Across three episodes, you uncover a terrible secret about what happened to a missing girl. It's very much focused on how you want to tell the story, and the branching narratives mean that it merits a few playthroughs just so you can see just how far the ripples of your actions and words stretch.\nAnd when you've done that, go play Before the Storm. The prequel focuses on the relationship between Chloe and Rachel before the events of Life is Strange. It's a powerful narrative on growing up, loss, and emotions. It feels more grounded because of its lack of the supernatural, helping make the story options connect and, more importantly, resonate. And like the original, every decision you make changes the flow of the story. Play it over and over again; you deserve it. Learn more in our Life is Strange: Before the Storm review.\n18. Uncharted 4: A Thief\u2019s End\nDeveloper: Naughty Dog\nReleased: 2016\nPlatform: PS4, PS5\nUncharted 2 may be the best pure expression of what Uncharted is all about, but it\u2019s Nathan Drake's final chapter - Uncharted 4: Among Thieves - that delivers the best story. Building on the emotional beats it mastered as a storyteller during the production of The Last of Us, Naughty Dog gives us a more thoughtful take on Nate.\nThis story is one that's filled with Indy-style thrills but also moments of quiet character pathos. This is the game where Drake finally starts to question his mortality and, more importantly, makes his peace with the fact that he needs to soldier up and become an actual adult. Out of all the Uncharted games, this entry stands out as the best and most captivating. Want a reminder of what made this adventure so memorable? Check out our Uncharted 4 review.\n17. Firewatch\nDeveloper: Campo Santo\nReleased: 2016\nPlatforms: PC, PS4, Xbox One,\nWalking simulator games that tug at your heartstrings have been seeing a surge of late, but few have dug into the deeper levels found in Campo Santo's Firewatch. The game partially works so well because of the premise: Henry, your character, is spending the summer working as a ranger in Wyoming. Although he wanted the gig to get away from his own thoughts and life, he winds up building a chatty relationship with his boss through their radio conversations.\nThat isolation, tucked away in a natural setting that's equal parts pretty and perilous, makes a perfect backdrop for this suspenseful tale. Each strange discovery Henry makes drives the story forward until it has the unstoppable momentum of an avalanche. Once you start playing, it's damn near impossible to put down until the final credits roll. Read our Firewatch review.\n16. Portal 2\nDeveloper: Valve\nReleased: 2011\nPlatforms: PC, Nintendo Switch (via the Portal: Companion Collection)\nAfter Portal's brilliant, minimalist narrative introduced gamers to the silent Chell and the decidedly less silent GLaDOS, Valve faced a tall order. How could a stunning short story be followed up with a full retail release? Could new characters really stand toe-to-toe with GLaDOS? The answer, astoundingly, was yes. All of the new characters added character to the world of Portal 2, from the curious Wheatley to the amazingly charismatic Cave Johnson.\nYes, there was still plenty more to see (and curse) from Aperture. Exploring the depths of the derelict business introduced us to new bits of lore, fleshing out the most important character in the series: the facility itself. Learning Aperture's backstory and finding out about GLaDOS's history was surprisingly touching. Chell's story, too, ended up concluding well, turning the relatively quaint story of the original into a saga as epic as nearly any other. Take a walk down memory lane in our Portal 2 review.\n15. Persona 4 Golden\nDeveloper: Atlus\nReleased: 2008\nPlatforms: PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, Switch\nPersona 4's greatest strength comes from pacing. The life of the protagonist plays out one day at a time for an entire year in the quiet town of Inaba. You dig deep into a murder mystery while also attending high school, working part-time jobs, and (most importantly) bonding with your new friends. You may enter a shadowy world of dungeons and monsters, but you become so attached to your new companions that a small moment in the park with one of them has more impact than the most intense boss battle.\nPersona 4's tale takes more than 80 hours to experience, but it never feels drawn out, as every day is a new chance to get closer to your friends. Characters like Teddy, Kanji, and Chie are well-defined by scenes that shift between comedy and drama fluidly, and you express your unique feelings for them through the expansive dialogue choices. When the story reaches its satisfying climax, you feel like you've gone through a life-changing ordeal with your best friends. When the game ultimately ends, it's hard not to shed tears for all you're saying goodbye to. For more, check out our Persona 4 Golden review.\n14. Red Dead Redemption 2\nDeveloper: Rockstar Games\nReleased: 2018\nPlatforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S\nThe second part of one of the greatest video game stories ever told. Once again, this is an exception to including multiple game entries from the same series in this list. Still, when it comes to Arthur Morgan's wondrous Wild West quest, what choice do we have?\nCombining empowering gunplay with one of the most geographically interesting open-world maps of all time, this is AAA storytelling at its best. Regardless of the fate of its outlaw, Red Dead Redemption 2 somehow sets the stage for an even more compelling sandbox story, with both games combining to create a larger, more cathartic story. Learn more in our Red Dead Redemption 2 review.\n13. Mass Effect 2\nDeveloper: BioWare\nReleased: 2011\nPlatforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S\nAssemble a crew of sidekicks, achieve the impossible, save the galaxy. It's hardly ground-breaking material for sci-fi, but Mass Effect 2 taps into one of the all-time classic adventure stories: uneasy allies versus overwhelming odds. And it all plays out in space, with the role of overwhelming odds being played by ancient, titanic machines. It's still punch-the-air satisfying when Shepard and friends smash through the game's suicide mission climax.\nFew other games make you feel so close to the supporting cast, either. Each crew member has a deep backstory and must ask you to make complex decisions to help them out, potentially souring your friendship with another character. When/if you lose one of them during the suicide mission, you feel genuine remorse, a great indicator that Mass Effect 2's story has left a lasting impression on you. And thanks to the release of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition, you have the perfect excuse to experience the story all over again or for the first time. Find out more in our Mass Effect Legendary Edition review.\n12. Half-Life 2\nDeveloper: Valve\nReleased: 2004\nPlatforms: PC\nNearly 20 years later and we're still waiting for the conclusion to Half-Life 2's story, but that doesn't stop it from being one of the best sci-fi narratives ever. Set some years after the events of the first game, Half-Life 2 sees Gordon Freeman (and his trusty crowbar) team up with Eli and Alyx Vance to fight off the Combine; a technologically superior multidimensional empire that managed to conquer Earth in just seven hours.\nUnlike the original game though, you have no idea what's been going on or what's about to happen, making the story all the more powerful because you're in the same situation as Gordon himself. Thanks to the trust it affords players, Half-Life 2 stands apart as a first-person shooter way ahead of its time, with a narrative that keeps you perplexed but forever invested. Get nostalgic with our original Half-Life 2 review.\n11. Shadow of the Colossus\nDeveloper: Team Ico/Bluepoint Games\nReleased: 2005\nPlatforms: PS4\nThe crux of this goliath-slaying quest's story may be held back to the final scene, yet though it's light on dialogue, Shadow of the Colossus is still one of the greatest video game tales ever told.\nCombine its bewitching score with a mysterious world that's begging to be explored and an emotionally tortured hero who clearly hates every action players force him into, and you have a narrative masterpiece. Dealing with guilt like almost no other game, SotC is one of the storytelling giants. Appropriate, given the subject matter. Read our Shadow of the Colossus review to learn more.\n10. Metal Gear Solid\nDeveloper: Konami\nReleased: 1998\nPlatforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch (via Master Collection)\nHideo Kojima's first real attempt at Hollywood-aping storytelling remains his best. The game that essentially created the 3D stealth genre is also one that tells a brilliant tale. In David Hayter's Solid Snake, you have the closest gaming equivalent to Die Hard's John McClane we\u2019ll ever have.\nA sturdy yet wisecracking lead who imbues every line he's given with deadpan life experience. Before Kojima fell in love with his own overblown scripts, Metal Gear Solid was the game where he managed to perfectly balance gameplay and (reasonably) tight plotting.\n9. Immortality\nDeveloper: Sam Barlow / Half Mermaid\nReleased: 2022\nPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, iOS, Android\nImmortality is an interactive trilogy from Her Story and Telling Lies developer Sam Barlow and Half Mermaid that expertly engrosses you in a mystery. With a novel approach to storytelling, the experience has you looking through reams of footage in three different movies that were never released.\nWith the goal of trying to uncover what happened to the missing film star Marissa Marcel, you'll watch scenes unfold and have to try and hone in on different aspects to uncover more footage. Every little detail or nuanced expression could be a new threat to pull at, with behind-the-scenes instances, film moments, and others that will keep you guessing as you try to get to the root of the mystery. With a voyeuristic feel at times, it succeeds at drawing you right into Marissa's world, and it's hard not to want to keep pulling at those threads to find out what truly happened. Read more in our glowing Immortality review.\n8. God of War\nDeveloper: Sony Santa Monica Studio\nReleased: 2018\nPlatforms: PS4, PS5, PC\nAfter the incredibly shouty original trilogy, few gamers would have thought Kratos and Santa Monica Studio had a great story in them. How wrong we were. While the original games were defined by all-consuming vengeful hate, the rebooted God of War ditches much of that loathing for deep-seated, yet restrained parental love.\nBy giving Kratos a son, Sony finally allows Kratos to become a truly three-dimensional character\u2026 albeit one who still yanks an ogre's innards out every 40 seconds. A special word, too, for Christopher Judge. The former Stargate SG1 actor makes a wonderful Kratos, giving a performance that dovetails between barely contained rage and an all-encompassing love for his child. Once you've experienced the story of the first game, it's well worth journeying your way through the recent follow-up, God of War Ragnarok. See what we thought of the game at launch in our God of War review.\n7. Telltale\u2019s The Walking Dead\nDeveloper: Telltale Games\nReleased: 2012\nPlatforms: PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch\nAn intense, emotional ride until the very end, Telltale's The Walking Dead was our game of the year in 2012 because of its gut-wrenching story. Lee Everett, a man on his way to prison, plays the unlikely hero who stumbles upon Clementine, a young girl whose parents were vacationing in another city when the zombie apocalypse happened. Their unexpected journey takes them to Savannah, where her parents should be, and along the way you meet a cast of characters who you grow to love (or hate with a burning passion).\nIt's okay, though, because there are instances when your choices affect their chances of staying in your group. The game's strengths are its dialogue and character development, and it's impossible not to feel sad, guilty, or angry whenever Clementine witnesses or experiences anything horrible. It's a given that when the dead start walking that there will be gruesome scenes, but the pacing, the execution of each scenario made The Walking Dead stand out. Find out more in our The Walking Dead game review.\n6. The Last of Us\nDeveloper: Naughty Dog\nReleased: 2013\nPlatforms: PS4, PS5, PC\nThe most emotionally layered, big-budget video game there's ever been. The Last of Us proves to be a masterclass in single-player pacing. Setting you in the shoes of a grizzled gunrunner who's more than done with the end of the world, TLOU stands unbelievably tall thanks to his relationship with a young girl who may just hold the key to saving humanity. Ellie isn't just one of the most complex heroes ever; she's arguably the greatest character in PlayStation history.\nWith a remastered re-release that brought the PS3 to PS4, Joel and Ellie's adventure also got a next-gen upgrade with the launch of The Last of Us Part 1. Plus, the story even saw the creation of the hit The Last of US HBO show, which is based on the game. Once you reach the conclusion of the first, it's also worth experiencing the sequel, The Last of Us 2. Find our more in our The Last of Us Part 1 review.\n5. What Remains of Edith Finch\nDeveloper: Giant Sparrow\nReleased: 2017\nPlatforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch\nIt's hard to tell you exactly why this indie's story is so utterly amazing without ruining it entirely, but that's part of its charm. The less you know about this electrically eclectic game, the better. Set aside a Sunday afternoon and play it through in one sitting, and, trust us, you won't regret it. What we can tell you is that it's a collection of strange stories about what happened to members of one family. Each one is told using a different gameplay style, and the way they play out is as inventive as the stories themselves. This is interactive storytelling at its finest.\nFreed from big-budget story pressures, What Remains of Edith Finch can be gloriously random whenever it wants. One moment you'll be playing as a seal-devouring shark, the next a fish-butchering factory worker. And just when you think you've got its narrative pacing pegged, Edith will floor you with an incredible homage to Michael Myers' Halloween. This is independent storytelling at its most nuanced.\n4. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt\nDeveloper: CD Projekt Red\nReleased: 2015\nPlatforms: PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch\nLook out, Nilfgaardians: Geralt is back in town. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt takes our gravel-voiced hero on a search for Ciri, his young ward who has attracted the malevolent interest of the Hunt. This whole game world draws its inspirations from Eastern Europe, giving it a different flavor than the average fantasy RPG. But The Witcher 3 transcends expectations for the genre left and right. The characters are fully realized and relatable, and their interactions have nuance.\nThe writing is head and shoulders above the average script. The game systems are impeccably executed and help to further the story. And where most games only have binary good-or-bad ethical rules, this series has always been most comfortable exploring the morally murky areas. The core game of Wild Hunt was a masterclass of storytelling, but the addition of the Blood & Wine DLC took the game's narrative to the next level. Read our Witcher 3 Wild Hunt review for more.\n3. Baldur's Gate 3\nDeveloper: Larian Studios\nReleased: 2023\nPlatforms: PC, PS5\nThe storytelling in Larian's D&D-infused RPG is masterful. Comprising three acts that are rich with choice and discovery, Baldur's Gate 3 sees you wake up aboard an alien ship with an unwelcome tadpole passenger taking up residence in your brain. You're then hurtled into an adventure full to the brim with memorable moments, mysteries to uncover, and enemies to face as you try to navigate your newfound connection to the Mindflayers and a nefarious cult of The Absolute.\nThe party members that join you are brilliantly brought to life with their own storylines, flaws, and nuances that make each and every one feel fleshed out and relatable, and getting to know them brings so much added depth to the adventure. There's also so much scope to relive the narrative in different ways, from creating your own character and picking one of many different classes, to experiencing one of the preset origins, or exploring the mysteriously murderous Dark Urge storyline. Baldur's Gate 3 truly takes you on an unforgettable journey with an impressive amount of choice that will surprise you time and again. Learn more in our glowing Baldur's Gate 3 review.\n2. BioShock\nDeveloper: Irrational Games\nReleased: 2009\nPlatform(s): PS4, Xbox One, PC\nWould you kindly... recognize the continued legacy of Irrational Games' BioShock? Far more than just its perfectly judged final act twist, Ken Levine's genre-defining shooter proves itself to be a master of background storytelling. In Rapture, you're dealing with one of the great video game settings: a submerged city that defies expectations at every wicked, watery turn.\nAt one point, you'll be admiring a giant squid as it scuttles past the hub of a long-submerged city. The next? You could easily be setting your Palpatine-style lightning hands on a monstrous deep-sea diver whose only purpose is to protect a small girl so sinister, she makes the kid out of The Ring look like Mary Poppins Jnr. See what we thought of the game at release in our BioShock review.\n1. Silent Hill 2\nDeveloper: Team Silent\nReleased: 2001\nPlatform(s): PS2, PS3, Xbox, Xbox 360, PC (Remake: PC, PS5)\nThere's a sinister genius to the storytelling in Silent Hill 2. It starts off as a mysterious love story: James Sunderland is searching for his wife after receiving a letter from her one year after her death. It ends up as something far darker and more complex. Silent Hill 2 tells its intricate story on multiple levels. While the spoken narrative leaves you in little doubt about what kind of man James Sunderland is, the way you play and interact with the world also has a impact.\nSpend the game at half health (or lower), for example, and you'll get a different ending because your lack of regard for his health tells the game that you think James is suicidal. Symbolism also plays a big role. Every disgusting creature in the game is a manifestation of James' twisted psyche; physical representations of his sexual hang-ups and guilt. By the end, you'll have lost every shred of empathy you had with the game's protagonist. How often do you get to play an entire horror game before discovering you're the real monster?

      "text": "After playing Swansong, perhaps Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines 2's voiced main character won't be such a bad thing\nOpinion | Some choice is better than none\nThe playable character in Vampire Masquerade: Bloodlines 2 will be fully-voiced, and some would-be Kindred are already worried about it. Developer The Chinese Room announced this rather huge change to the Bloodlines formula on Halloween (via YouTube), and when I first heard the news, I'll admit I shared the initial set of concerns. I've long championed the fact that we need more vampires in video games, especially when it comes to creating a totally original character, and the tighter storyline implications of having a voiced lead in Bloodlines 2 risks shattering that fantasy.\nBut having finally started playing last year's Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Swansong, though, I'll take what I can get. I didn't get any say over Galeb, Emem, and Leysha's traits at all, but their voice acting is arguably what keeps me interested in their stories. As much as I would've loved to design my own Bloodlines 2 character in more granular detail, having a preset archetype with thoughtfully-written backstories to color in sounds like the best of both worlds.\nBite me\nCheck out the best RPGs of all time, from Skyrim to Dragon Age.\nAfter many years embroiled in the embodiment of developmental hell, Bloodlines 2 is finally on its way \u2013 hopefully for good this time. The Chinese Room expects the sequel to land in the coming year, almost 20 years since the first game. Given Bloodlines' cult following, it seems TCR is faced with a tall order \u2013 taller still for the fact that it seemingly won't be anything like the first game at all.\nIn many ways, that's a good thing. It's easy to look back with rose-tinted glasses, but the reality is that Troika Games' 2004 RPG was as flawed as it was groundbreaking. Sure, we got to choose our vampire clan, gender, backstory, and fill out our character sheets, but what felt clunky in 2004 just feels downright unpleasant today. Technological advancements and modern standards in mind, The Chinese Room doesn't seek to remake the original, but innovate and build on what made it great to begin with.\nOne of Bloodlines' strong points has always been the voice acting of its NPCs, bolstered by a strong script. It's something we see again in developer Big Bad Wolf's more recent entry, Swansong. The game takes a more puzzle-exploration and TTRPG-based approach, relying on skill points and dice rolls to dictate the outcome of dialogue choices. It might not have the flashiest graphics or tons of swanky weapons, but the writing and voice acting more than make up for it. The dramatic inner workings of the Boston Camarilla are fascinating when told through the eyes of three different characters, and although created by a totally different developer, it gives me hope for Bloodlines 2.\nCharacter building\nVampire: The Masquerade games are known for their dynamic characters, and that looks set to continue in Bloodlines 2. Our playable character will be an elder vampire named Phyre, recently awoken after centuries of slumber, as they grapple with the modern world. The Chinese Room is still letting us customize elements of Phyre's backstory, despite clearly having a specific narrative in mind.\nBloodlines 2 having a voiced protagonist is far from the biggest difference between The Chinese Room's sequel and Troika's original. We will be able to choose to play either a male or female Phyre, edit their appearance, and assign them to one of four clan backgrounds. The developer has so far only announced warrior clan Brujah as an option, but with thirteen very different possibilities on the table, it leaves plenty of room for four very different Phyres. In contrast, your clan in the original Bloodlines simply dictated your Disciplines in the framework of an overarching story.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nMasquerade fans, I implore you: it's not the end of the world. 'Half-set' video game protagonists are nothing new, and at least in Bloodlines 2, there's a reason behind it. We're presented with the cosmetic illusion of choice between a male or female Eivor in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, for example, but the storyline remains the same regardless. Meanwhile, we can choose life paths and attributes for V in Cyberpunk 2077, but whatever you choose, they're still called V. Developers are aware that we like to have an element of choice when it comes to our RPG heroes, but roleplaying a pre-written character can still be incredibly fulfilling. I mean, just look at The Witcher 3.\nMy brain might have short-circuited when I thought about it at first, but now, I'm actually excited to meet the fully-voiced Phyre. By giving us creative boundaries to work in, Bloodlines 2 is primed to reap the benefits of both the action and RPG genres to deliver well-written characters as well as player choice. Perhaps I'm overly optimistic, but after so many years in the making, I just want to see this game flourish \u2013 whether or not I get to create-a-vamp from scratch.\nJasmine is a staff writer at GamesRadar+.

      "text": "After 21 years and various delays, Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 finally gets a solid release date during Gamescom Opening Night Live\nThe first Bloodlines RPG launched in 2004\nLong-awaited sequel Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, developed by Still Wakes the Deep studio The Chinese Room and published by Paradox Interactive, finally has a release date set in stone. It's right around the corner.\nNearly 21 years have passed since the original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines from Troika Games and Activision launched in 2004, but fans of the RPG are finally within arm's reach of its sequel. The game's leaked release date from earlier this month has turned out to be true after all, as revealed during tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 showcase \u2013 lifting the veil on Bloodlines 2's October 21 arrival.\nThat's right, the previously provided October release window has now been solidified with an actual date, and one that's only a couple of months off, at that. Judging by what the sequel's developers have previously shared, from the attention paid to the game's \"quantity of detail over scope\" in production to its \"vampire romance\" and more, there's plenty to look forward to in the new Bloodlines entry \u2013 and I, for one, will be doing just that.\nBut the Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 release date is not the only exciting news to come from today's Opening Night Live \u2013 there's plenty more to come, as per the Gamescom 2025 schedule.\nFor anyone interested in following along with the full event, be sure to explore how to watch The Future Games Show 2025 and this week's other showcases.\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have a vampire to roleplay in an RPG that's over a decade old before October 21 rolls around.\nWhile you wait for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, why not browse through some of the other most exciting new games this year and beyond to keep an eye on?\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nAfter spending years with her head in various fantastical realms' clouds, Anna studied English Literature and then Medieval History at the University of Edinburgh, going on to specialize in narrative design and video game journalism as a writer.

      "text": "What is the Baldur's Gate 3 Dark Urge?\nThe Dark Urge in BG3 is an origin character afflicted with violent compulsions...\nThe Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 Dark Urge origin character initially seems like one for players that want to be evil. By default, they are a Dragonborn, but you can make them look however you want. The unifying factor is that, in addition to the tadpole-induced amnesia that your created characters have, they also have an overwhelming urge to kill running through their mind.\nWhile this obviously lends itself well to an evil run of Baldur's Gate 3, specifically one where you are essentially leaving murder mysteries across the map, it\u2019s important to note that the Dark Urge doesn\u2019t have to be evil. If you want, you can play them as resisting the Dark Urge, making it a redemptive tale.\nWhichever you choose, this guide will help you learn more about the Dark Urge and what to expect when playing as them.\nWhat is the Dark Urge in Baldur's Gate 3?\nDark Urge is a Baldur's Gate 3 origin archetype. Origins are preset characters with some locked-in attributes, allowing you to play the game as any of your companions, such as Lae'zel, Astarion, or Wyll. Creating a fully custom character in BG3 means you will be able to change any and all aspects of your playable character's stats, appearance, class, race, and more.\nUnlike other origins, Dark Urge offers more of a mysterious backstory than a character in itself. It assigns unique personal quest goals and perspectives to an otherwise fully custom character for you to create, and what you uncover about their past won't be pretty.\nShould you play as the Dark Urge?\nYou can play as a Dark Urge origin from your very first Baldur's Gate 3 playthrough, but that doesn't necessarily mean you should. As recommended by a writer at developer Larian Studios, the Dark Urge origin choice in the game's comprehensive character customization menu offers a sordid twist on the main game plotline. It might be better appreciated once you've already played the main campaign as a totally original character, giving you more scope for comparison. However, nothing is stopping you from selecting it from the get-go.\nIt really comes down to personal preference \u2013 do you mind having an angsty backstory underscoring the game's events? Are you planning on playing a ruthless villain-type anyway? Or are you trying to be as humane as possible? If the latter is true for you, Dark Urge is not the Baldur's Gate 3 origin you'll want to opt for.\nTL;DR: If you've played BG3 through and are keen for something new, Dark Urge might be something to consider. If you're just stepping in for the first time and don't want anything to detract from the core experience, it's probably something to try after you complete it at least once.\nSpoiler Warning: from this point on the guide we'll be discussing more detailed elements of the Dark Urge's storyline. If you don't want the plot revealed, turn away now!\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nThe Dark Urge's storyline\nDark Urge substantially changes Baldur's Gate 3 as you know it, both in storyline and in how you interact with the world around you. We're not going to spoil it, but the Dark Urge is actually implicates your character in the main plot in a very meaningful way by changing the events of Act 3 considerably.\nNot only are you encouraged to kill your most beloved companion at once point, but there are some pretty major things your Urge wants you to do - should you heed its bloodthirsty call, after all, since there is always an element of choice in this huge RPG. One of these choices is to kill Isobel even after defending her at the Last Light Inn in Baldur's Gate 3, something that has cataclysmic effects later down the line.\nAlso, Dark Urge doesn't lock you into a certain appearance while making your character. Selecting Dark Urge gives you a fixed background as the Haunted One \u2013 \"you see flashes of a wicked face in your dreams\" \u2013 but you can still choose your own appearance, class, and race. You'll also run into the same cohort of Baldur's Gate 3 companions on your journey, so choosing Dark Urge doesn't seem to lose you any friends at face value.\nThat being said, you'll have the opportunity to react to events with unique dialogue options that might earn disapproval from your party members. During a conversation with an NPC, or even while having a private moment of thought, you'll often see a response option that sounds a bit more violent than the others. Whether it's dreaming of Astarion's \"perfect pretty corpse\" or letting a tiefling child die for your own amusement, your Dark Urge is always there to offer a wickeder, more macabre view of the world. Whether or not you follow the urge is entirely your prerogative; you can embrace it or fight against it, and what happens next is yet to be seen.\nThere are some unique gameplay moments that seem to only happen with Dark Urge selected. The Dark Urge brutally murders a tiefling bard named Alfira after she asks to join your party in earnest, and there's no way around it. While staying overnight at Emerald Grove and taking a long rest in Baldur's Gate 3, your Dark Urge character will awaken to find Alfina's butchered corpse splayed out in front of their bedroll, blood all over their hands. You can choose to quietly bury the body in a ditch, do nothing, or come clean to your companions. This is just one Dark Urge-specific moment in Baldur's Gate 3, but things get even more complex with the introduction of Sceleritas Fel.\nWho is Sceleritas Fel in Baldur's Gate 3?\nSceleritas Fel is your Dark Urge butler, who you meet if you indulge your bloodlust and give in to those baser instincts instead of pushing the thoughts away. He introduces himself to you once night during a Long Rest following your slaughter of Alfira.\nIf you're wondering if there any Dark Urge-exclusive items in Baldur's Gate 3, you're in luck. To thank you for your violent outbursts, Sceleritas will gift you the Deathstalker Mantle as a token of his appreciation. The Deathstalker Mantle is a cloak that gives you invisibility for one turn after you kill an enemy in battle: a great trade for a bad day's work.\nCan you romance as the Dark Urge?\nYes, you can romance with a Dark Urge character - and the experience is actually much richer when you do. Baldur's Gate 3 romance is a huge draw for many people, and although it's difficult at times cult to raise my approval with anyone except Gale and Wyll, you can still flirt with your companions as a Dark Urge origin. You still get to create your Baldur's Gate 3 guardian during character creation, still smooch your beau under the stars, and dream sweet dreams of them....until the bloodlust takes hold and you almost murder one of them in their sleep. Ouch.\nWhat is the Slayer in Baldur's Gate 3?\nIn BG3, The Slayer is a behemoth shapeshifting form that the Dark Urge can transform into once per Long Rest. You are \"gifted\" the ability to turn into the Slayer as a reward for doing something especially evil in Act 2, and boy does it take the sting out of some boss fights. The Slayer comes with 98 HP and some very powerful attacks, making it not unlike the polar bear animal form that Baldur's Gate 3 Druids can take.\nIf you want to know what significance the Slayer has in terms of the Dark Urge's storyline, it might be a little bit spoilerific. Stop reading now if you don't want to know - but the Slayer is tied to Bhaal, God of Murder. This means that the Dark Urge is his long-long favorite child, and his true intended Chosen. Naturally, this also has ramifications for your story later down the line, especially when it comes to dealing with Orin the Red and getting her Netherstone\nUnique endings for the Dark Urge in Baldur's Gate 3\nAs the Dark Urge, you can choose to give into your birthright as Bhaal's Chosen or reject him and rid yourself of his gifts. Should you choose the former, you'll have a mission goal called \"DESTROY THE GATE IN BHAAL'S NAME\". This plays out much like the BG3 ending where you command the brain and become the Absolute, only this time, you're doing it in Bhaal's name rather than your own.\nHere's how to adjust your Baldur's Gate 3 difficulty, whether you're after a challenge or want to focus on the story.\n\u00a9 GamesRadar+.

      "text": "Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 has \"been through a lot,\" Paradox says as fans revolt against day one DLC, which is \"a way to get additional players in that have been asking for that content\"\n\"It's not uncommon for games to come out with additional content\"\nAfter years in development hell, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is finally set to launch on October 21. While that announcement at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 should've been cause for relief among fans, the simultaneous reveal of pricey add-ons for day one DLC with new playable clans has been cause for substantial backlash.\n\"It's not uncommon for games to come out with additional content,\" a PR rep for publisher Paradox tells PCGamesN in response to the controversy, \"and given the nature of the game as it stands, where it's been through a lot, this is a way to get additional players in that have been asking for that content, and asking for those clans, on day one.\"\nA quick glance at the Bloodlines subreddit, which is currently filled with posts like \"I'm just not paying 34\u20ac extra for a 60\u20ac game that shows no respect for the long-time fans\" and \"Is Paradox smoking crack?\" will show you the general tone of the community's response to the DLC reveal. I doubt the assertion that \"a day one upsell is simply giving players what they want\" is going to be accepted.\nParadox has a reputation for extensive DLC releases across games like Crusader Kings and Cities: Skylines, but while its aggressive expansions have been criticized, there's also a key difference here: Those are sandbox games you'll likely come back to over and over again, which constantly benefit from new gameplay options no matter how deep in you've gotten.\nThe day one DLC for Bloodlines 2 includes a pair of new clans, which are effectively classes. The pressure to pay more for those options feels a lot more difficult to ignore when you're going to be making decisions about your playstyle at the very start of the game \u2013 especially since this is an RPG many players are likely to play through just once or twice. Hardcore fans may want to keep coming back to see how every clan plays, sure, but locking those options behind a paywall seems to be a sure way to push them away.\nFor more on the biggest new games of 2025, stick with us as the Gamescom 2025 schedule rolls on, and follow our Gamescom 2025 day 1 live coverage for the quickest updates.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nDustin Bailey joined the GamesRadar team as a Staff Writer in May 2022, and is currently based in Missouri.

      "text": "Everything announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025\nOpening Night Live 2025 is officially over, but the real showcase was inside our hearts all along\nAnd with that, Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 has concluded! There's still the entire actual Gamescom event itself over the rest of the week, so there's plenty more to come, but host Geoff Keighley has already given two hours and change worth of reveals, trailers, updates, and announcements.\nMuch of what might be considered the bigger announcements had been teased, rumored, and leaked ahead of time, but that didn't stop me from standing up and cheering with the new Lego Batman game got revealed anyway. And Fallout season 2 has a premiere date! Keep reading for everything announced of note from ONL this year, and beyond that is a live (and lively) recap of the blow-by-blow from the event itself.\nEverything announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025\n- Fallout season 2 trailer takes us to New Vegas, teases the Ghoul's tragic backstory, and sees Walton Goggins fight off a Deathclaw\n- Geoff Keighley breaks straight through the bottom of the barrel, shows 30 seconds of Hollow Knight Silksong gameplay at Gamescom ONL before re-announcing the Team Cherry reveal we already knew about\n- Yes, those leaks were true: Black Ops 7 is out this November, it's still coming to PS4 and Xbox One, and there's an open beta right around the corner\n- Black Myth: Wukong dev announces new action RPG Black Myth: Zhong Kui, admits it's \"little more than an empty folder at this stage\" and it has \"absolutely no idea\" when it's coming out, then teases more Wukong to come\n- Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is coming in 2026 and Matt Berry voicing Bane is something I never knew I needed\n- The Ghostrunner devs have cooked up a first-person Soulslike that looks like BioShock meets Bloodborne, and oh yeah, it's set in fictional 19th century Europe during the Napoleonic Wars\n- With \"over one million\" customization combos, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's second story DLC will turn the RPG into a city builder that looks like the Sims Medieval remake I'll never get\n- The new CRPG from the Disco Elysium studio actually looks kind of cool, but after a biblically messy breakup with the original devs it's hard to get invested\n- The best-worst Soulslike of 2023 is getting a sequel: Lords of the Fallen 2 announced for 2026, and it sure looks like an Epic exclusive on PC\n- Sekiro: No Defeat is the FromSoftware anime that's been rumored for years, and it's coming to Crunchyroll as a crimson-soaked trailer details \"a tale of loyalty and blood\"\n- Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 is real, and the devs seem keen to wash the bad taste of the last RTS out of everyone's mouths \"with classic Dawn of War gameplay\"\n- They let me play as a radical frog wizard in a roguelike fusion of Golden Axe and Capcom's classic D&D brawlers, and suddenly its October launch is even more exciting\n- The best part of Ghost of Tsushima is back: Sony confirms Ghost of Yotei Legends DLC is coming next year with 4 classes and new co-op missions\n- New Bloober game trailer at Gamescom seems to include a secret Silent Hill 2 cameo, unless I'm as confused as James Sunderland\n- Cult of the Lamb's new DLC is cooling us down in the snowy mountains after the roguelike's steamy \"sex update\" from last year\n- Monkey Island designer and point-and-click legend Ron Gilbert moving to the roguelike mines feels like my personal hell, but the trailer looks fun enough that I'm trying to keep an open mind\n- The Outer Worlds 2 shows off its roster of companions and ruins the day of many a RPG fan by immediately saying \"no, you can't sleep with them\"\n- After 21 years and various delays, Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 finally gets a solid release date during Gamescom Opening Night Live\n- I guess we're riding Chocobos now: Monster Hunter Wilds and Final Fantasy 14 reveal huge crossover with some of the action RPG and MMO's best boss battles and characters changing games\n- You know and hated Bubsy 3D, now get ready for Bubsy 4D from Atari: a bit of '90s \"platforming purrfection\" that might signal the End Times\nMost importantly, here's everything you'll need to actually watch Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 when it kicks off proper:\nYouTube and Twitch are your best bets for actually watching, and be sure to tune in at 11am PT/2pm ET/7pm BST/8pm CEST \u2013 and 30 minutes prior to that if you want the pre-show and everything.\nSo, what do we actually know is going to make an appearance? Quite a bit, actually! While specifics are hard to come by, Geoff Keighley regularly teases what sort of appearances to expect ahead of Gamescom Opening Night Live \u2013 and has done so for years at this point.\nCase in point: we already know to expect something from Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Resident Evil Requiem, and Amazon's Prime Video's Fallout Season 2.\nHere's how to watch @gamescom ONL live today!8p CEST / 7p BST / 2p ET / 11a PT.2 hour show with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Resident Evil Requiem, Fallout Season 2 + More- YouTube: https://t.co/3lDIqpjxw9- Twitch: https://t.co/zeEycbJvQ8- X: https://t.co/sjdvH6QWGRAugust 19, 2025\n...I was about to say that Hollow Knight: Silksong's appearance during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 seemed like it was up in the air after a noncommittal Keighley tease, but it's just been announced that there's going to be a \"special announcement\" early on Thursday, August 21.\nI just can't decide whether that means we'll definitely see some kind of teaser for the announcement today or we definitely won't. There's still plenty of time to apply clown makeup.\nOK, well, assuming there's some kind of Hollow Knight: Silksong news today, what's the one thing you hope to see that isn't that? The absolute longshot that would have you jumping out of your seat?\nAs always, for me, it's a Valkyria Chronicles remake or massive remaster. Or even just bringing Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 out of PSP jail and an actual English localization for the latter. Sega, are you out there? It's me, Rollin.\nIn more likely news, there has to be a Fallout season 2 trailer of some kind during Gamescom Opening Night Live, right? After all the teasing with the Fallout season 2 poster last week and the first look images just yesterday? The timing just screams a full-on trailer. We know it's coming in December already, so maybe... an actual release date as well? Not long now until we all collectively find out.\npic.twitter.com/SdND7PdpNaAugust 18, 2025\nJust an hour to go until Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 proper and around 30 minutes for the pre-show! Still plenty of time to get some snacks, a drink, and settle in for a lengthy series of reveals and announcements.\nAnd if you're already up anyway, I wouldn't mind a Topo Chico. Cheers.\nAn absolutely massive audio jump scare there from a tab buried deep in my browser indicates that the placeholder video has actually begun! It's really real, folks. (And also, a handy little bug in the upper right informs that the pre-show really will start in about 28 minutes as expected.)\nWith just 15 minutes left (give or take) before the Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 pre-show begins in earnest, this is one of your absolute last chances for a called shot. What do you think will make a surprise appearance tonight that isn't already expected to some degree?\nAll right, here we go for the pre-show...\nKyle Bosman is back once again. Reminding us this is not the main show. This is the waiting room. \"It's good itself,\" Bosman says. OK.\n...immediately leading into something about Bubsy. Kyle, you just said the pre-show was good.\nBubsy 4D! 3D platformer, orange cat(?) character. No pants. Coming to basically all consoles and PC. Up for wishlisting now.\nAs with all Keighley-produced shows, no waiting around. Immediately into something that kind of looks a bit like a Telltale-style Battlestar Galactica game? Stylized art, lots of shots of ships. Gameplay now! Looks less Telltale and more tactical like Stellaris or something. Battlestar Galactica: Shattered Hopes coming early 2026.\nAh, trailer for a LucasArts classic remastered by Nightdive! This has to be Outlaws, which was rumored this week after a Steam update to the original. Bit of Doom in the West with some LucasArts flavor and animation. \"Pre-order now,\" no date associated.\nMoving right along! Colorful... Tony Hawk on-rails skater but with a train? Some real Katamari meets Crazy Taxi meets Hi-Fi Rush style going on here. And probably more Subway Surfers than I'd like to admit.\nDenshattack! Coming Spring 2026.\nLee Petty, creative director on Keeper at Double Fine, is here to talk about the game. Discussing how the bird and lighthouse in game work together and what sort of relationship they have. \"The bird becomes, I think, the emotional heart of the game,\" Petty says. Cites The Dark Crystal as inspiration.\nKeeper releases October 17! That's it! Bosman once again hypes up the pre-show, which... I guess.\nAnd now, a He-Man game. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction coming to all platforms. Looks like a beat-'em-up in classic arcade fashion with He-Man characters. The trailer is even framed as old school with toys and a CRT.\nNew Absolum trailer! Stylized animation here of rescuing a frog (?) kid. Dodging arrows only to have a shield ability stop them thanks to a frog (?) wizard. Yeah, this looks great. A bit like Cuphead meets beat-'em-up rather than a side-scrolling shooter.\nBrand-new look at Long gone. Pixel art apocalypse game. Zombie at the gate struggles to try and bite our protagonist. Not well, though. Narrative adventure about rummaging in ruins. Some fun perspective shifts around the diorama-like pixel environments, though. \"Wishlist now!\"\nNo time to linger! Now from the creators of Ghostrunner comes: a haunting-looking game. Firearms being held in the back of a wagon. Looks almost revolutionary times here. Bayonetsand snow and blood. But wait: some kind of mysterious vial is transforming a fallen soldier into an absolute beast.\nCut to a desolate battlefield and now actual gameplay. Running around the landscape with a sword, revolver, casting some kind of magic and using vials for yourself. There's a real \"Revolutionary War BioShock\" vibe here. And the monsters look gnarly.\nValor Mortis is the name! No date.\nBosman is now counting down 10 reasons to be excited while watching this. Did Geoff just not sell this slot?\nThis is a good time to sit back and ruminate on the fact that there's a whole additional two hours to go. Pray for Rollin.\nAnd now, a new look at a Kepler Interactive game that I will not attempt to spell here. Looks a bit like a retrofuturistic Steel Battalion/Planetary Invaders? Summer 2026, wishlist on Steam. Really looked like a new style of Missile Command to me. Do want.\nAnd now, a terrifying trailer pieced together of footage of abandoned quarantine areas in some game. Bad robot there doesn't look fun. Feels a bit Dead Space in presentation, but certainly no creepy crawlies just yet. Don't like the mysterious sounds emanating in this waterlogged hallway. Routine is the name. Coming Late 2025, wishlist now.\nMore trailers! Some dead person arrives in the underworld. But they have to go back to the mortal world! For some reason. Looks a bit like Black Myth Wukong to my eyes mixed with more humans. Big monster, ghost-like women, fiery dragon dancer, big guy with sword. Also there are apparently summons of some kind? And a whole entire house chasing you down to eat you. Yeah, all right, sold.\nSwords of Legends is the name. No date or anything else!\nOnto the next thing. Guy hauling a big rig... Something from Saber and Focus. Just so much time spent on the trucking aspect here that I have to imagine this is some kind of sim.\nSevere weather's cropped up, and now they have to \"get it done.\" Be the hero of the open road. Road Kings. Don't mind Stuntman: Trucking Edition.\nSonic Racing Crossworlds up now! Pac-Man's here. All right. That's it! It's over! The real Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 is up next. In the meantime, here's that Valor Mortis trailer:\nGeoff Keighley takes the stage! Didn't really catch what shoes he's wearing, but I did look.\nMore than 1,500 exhibitors at Gamescom. \"Turns out E3 didn't die, it just moved right here to Germany,\" says Keighley. Sure.\nPeak has sold over 10 million copies. Cool and nice. Date Everything's sold an estimate half a million. \"Small teams with big ideas can change the industry,\" says Keighley. This is a leadup to Hollow Knight: Silksong!\nHollow Knight: Silksong is 100%, actually launching this year, per Keighley. Gameplay showing the protagonist zooming around taking on various bugs. Keighley hypes up the Nintendo and Xbox booths, where you can play. It's real. Also flags the news coming on Thursday, August 21.\nOpening cinematic of World of Warcraft Midnight from Blizzard on the way in addition to all the previous teases. Keighley says it's the biggest Opening Night Live they've ever done. I'll believe it when I see it.\nLights go out in Cologne here. Some kind of... haunting taunt. \"You will know fear.\" Red light bathes everything. \"They want you afraid.\" Mindbending visuals... Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. Welcome back modern Deus Ex.\nThere's some kind of trickery happening here that sort of creates an unreal environment, roads twisting impossibly into the air. On top of the futuristic aspect here, it's hard to image how this even plays and what makes it Call of Duty? But maybe I'm out of the loop.\nConcludes with a big huge person attacking. All right. Quick zombies tease here too... All right. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 releases November 14.\nTreyarch's Myles Leslie and Natalie Podgorski from Raven take the stage to talk CoD. Myles says they're pushing the envelope again. Future that's just out of reach, but twisted. \"It's a world of fear,\" Myles says. Pulling threads from Black Op 2 and 6.\nDavid Mason returns, but he is not the same. \"He's carrying deep scars,\" Myles says. Natalie adds that there's an organization called \"The Guild\" that's clashing in the game. Avalon is the central city, more than just a backdrop. Evolves with the player. Hm.\nCo-op campaign! Can be played solo or up to four players. Every mission handcrafted for variety. Tone, pacing, location. Real and \"human psyche\" locations both. Natalie says the game is \"all about innovation\" both with gameplay, stories, and more. More about all of that at Call of Duty Next.\nBehind-the-scenes commentary here. Talk about letting solo players and multiplayer groups able to play through the same campaign and get something out of it. Pacing shifts between high-intensity combat and psychological sequences. Avalon is central, but there's plenty beyond that city geographically and otherwise.\nThere's also \"The Endgame\" which is a proving grounds of sorts? \"Each run is a new step in your power journey.\" Sounds a bit... roguelike? Hard to say with what we've actually seen here.\nCall of Duty Next on September 30 will have more all about Black Ops 7. Keighley hypes up more about Fallout season 2 and a new Ron Gilbert game.\nSjokz takes the stage. First new game announcement at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 proper!\nDeep dark and bloody, consumptive. Knights with big sword absolutely tearing people apart. Angelic enemy demolishes the entrance to a castle. OK, yeah, this looks like a banger. The fight between the knight and angel is gnarly. Lords of the Fallen 2, coming 2026. Wishlist now.\nSet 100 years after the last game. \"Bloodier, faster, and more brutal than ever.\" Gameplay first look later this year.\nFootage of what looks to be a Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice anime. Colorful, quick, bloody, gorgeous animation here. Sekiro: No Defeat, coming exclusive to Crunchyroll. \"Looks awesome,\" says Keighley.\nAnd now: a Batman Lego game of some kind! This was heavily rumored. Looks to replicate at least some of the Nolan movies? Gliding, sneaky, taking on minifig bad guys... delightful. \"Build the legacy.\" We've got a Lego Batmobile! Joker! Catwoman! Mimes?\nLego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight. We've got Nolan Bane here doing the \"adopted the dark\" who then steps on a Lego brick... is that Matt Berry?\nJonathan Smith, head of development, here to talk about the game. \"We are so thrilled to reveal this game,\" he says. But that's not all: at Gamescom, people can actually play. Keighley notes lots of references.\nSmith says this is the definitive, essential Batman story. \"From origin to legend.\" League of Shadows, crime in Gotham's street. Establish legacy as the Dark Knight. Iconic moments, deep cut references, from everything: comics, games, movies, shows. All of it. All brought together in the Lego world.\n...looks a bit like Arkham combat here as gameplay is shown off? Dancing around combat. Playable partner allies like Alfred and Robin and Catwoman and so on. Joker, Bane, Penguin are enemies, and yes \u2013 that was Matt Berry voicing Bane. Open world Gotham.\nWhile we wait for the next announcement, why not check out our Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 preview?\nAnd now, something Warhammer. (I don't go here, I'm so sorry to all my UK colleagues.\" Looks like 40k, though, and a big sequel long in the making was teased... Dawn of War 4? Dawn of War 4.\nA new RTS in the Warhammer 40k universe, coming 2026. All right. I'm excited for all of you that are excited.\nMonster Hunter Wilds here with: a Final Fantasy 14 collaboration! You love to see it. Title Update 3 adds Omega Planetes in late September.\nYoshi-P for Square Enix and Ryozo Tsujimoto from Capcom take the stage. Ryozo says that after the collab for World, he spoke with Yoshi-P about being excited to do it again. This was just a glimpse, though. More coming next month.\nYoshi-P, for his part, says that it's a full-on crossover/collaboration. Final Fantasy 14 will also be having special collaboration content inside it. And now, a short trailer from the Final Fantasy 14 half of things.\nLooks like the Monster Hunter Wilds mount, the little cat friends (I'm so sorry, their name escapes me) and some of the monsters from Monster Hunter Wilds are on the way. Early October! Not long to wait to find out more.\nAnd now, a trailer that's not actual gameplay. Some kind of haunting trailer exploring abandoned areas. \"Do you believe this is real? This isn't a game. It's a test.\"\nLots of surreal imagery for........ a trailer about Gamescom itself? OK.\nUp next: a video game! Thanks, Geoff. Brand-new look at Onimusha: Way of the Sword. Coming 2026.\nLots of combat showing different enemies, environments, and brutal swordplay. A lightning beast of some kind as well as a strangely flexible and stretchy femme monster with a too-long neck. That's it!\nMoving on! Arknights: Endfield, maybe? Lots of building and anime girls, which certainly seems to fit the bill. Yes, Arknights: Endfield. Some beautiful environments and buildings. High-tech gadgets and gear and manufacturing lines combined with action combat, looks like. No date or anything, didn't seem, but solid little trailer.\nWe're onto something from Paradox right now but while that builds to a climax, peep the Lego Batman reveal trailer it's so good.\nParadox was Europa Universalis 5! Congratulations to everyone that loves those games.\nDaemon x Machina: Titanic Scion up now! Demo is out... right now. Seems very JRPG with a smidge of Armored Core. Not opposed.\nAnd now: some kind of shooter that's Returnal-meets-Marathon vibes. Voidbreaker. All right. Come and gone though, because Fallout season 2 is up now!\nStars Ella Purnell and Aaron Moten take the stage alongside the EPs! Jonathan Nolan says they just wrapped and hopped on a plane to Gamescom. Nice.\nElla says her character's journey in season 2 is all about what her character, Lucy, will do when she finds her dad. Will The Ghoul transform Lucy? Or will Lucy transform The Ghoul?\nAaron says his involved with the Brotherhood of Steel is a real \"careful what you wish for\" moment.\nCan we expect more Cooper Howard flashbacks in the new season? Yes, of course. (We've seen as much in the first-look images.)\nWith New Vegas, any more direct ties to the characters and locations from the video games? One particular character from New Vegas that Nolan wanted to be sure to include... \"I heard you like world premieres,\" says Aaron.\nWorld premiere of Fallout season 2 teaser trailer! Here we go.\nLucy is looking for \"someone\" with The Ghoul. Someone she cares about, or someone she hates? Wondering why her dad would go to Las Vegas. Per The Ghoul, the world ending started in Vegas with one man.\nSure enough, there's the man himself: Mr. House. Apparently he knows the bombs and war are coming. \"I think you are actually quite a violent man, you just don't want to kill me... yet.\" Lots of Power Armor shots, including Cooper Howard in one. The hotel from New Vegas where you find Boone? And finally, a deathclaw tease. \"I defer to you about what to do in this situation,\" says Lucy.\nDecember 17. And Fallout season 2 posters.\nIndiana Jones DLC gameplay from The Order of Giants. Some background on \"the legend of the nameless warrior,\" tall like a giant. Indy's got his work cut out for him as he immediately accidentally drops something he promises not to drop. Giant guardians with roots going way back. \"I can't believe you dare to investigate this,\" someone says.\nEnvironmental puzzles with statues. \"Not dead. He's not in a tomb.\" Uh oh.\nThe Order of Giants DLC releases on September 4. Small tease at the end: it's coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.\nAnd next: new trailer for Deadpool VR revealing more villains and the release date. Mojo, Omega Red, Lady Deathstrike, Ultimo, Mephisto. Deadpool is sent to grab them for Mojo, seems like? Lady Deadpool teased, November 18 release date. John Leguizamo voices Mojo!\nNo time to dwell, however; onto the next world premiere. Tanks running through swamps and snow and sand and... is this World of Tanks?\nLook, I'll say this, these World of Tanks trailers are genuinely very much hype. 2.0 releases in early September. Biggest update in the game's history. Cool.\nJohn Carpenter's Toxic Commando up now! Gameplay premiere. From Saber and Focus, there's a real Left 4 Dead But Stranger Things Turned to 11 aspect to this. Zombies, gross giant tendrils. First-person shooting, zooming around in vehicles. Early 2026 release date. Also? Some kind of... animated something or other coming soon?\nRon Gilbert game up next! Death by Scrolling. Roguelike, vertically scrolling RPG about staying ahead of the Grim Reaper in Purgatory. Oh no, this pixel art is charming. A bit like a reverse Downwell? Run, fight, loot, and don't stop because the Reaper is waiting.\nAnd now, a new look at what (the current version of) ZA/UM is up to. An espionage thriller of some kind. \"I once knew a spy. Brilliant. Relentless. Magnetic.\" A very Blade Runner presentation here with a grimy retrofuturistic design. Same kind of slightly isometric CRPG. Zero Parades is the name of the game. Coming to Steam.\nAnd now, a Gamescom Cares bit about The Darkest Files \u2013 based on real events. Shows how quickly a constitutional state can become unjust. Quick look at two other games that also engage with \"our concerns, our fears, our hopes, and what preoccupies us.\" Notes that games have power to engage with serious topics while democracy is under attack and minority rights are being violated.\nAnd now: a quick montage of footage for Neverness to Everness, which looks like Zenless Zone Zero meets GTA meets Honkai Star Rail. Interesting, albeit horny.\nAnd now, a trailer for the musical game Unbeatable! November 6 release date! This montage is moving too fast to get accurate details on everything, so in the immortal words of Iwata, please understand.\nBrief, flashy trailer for the upcoming Honor of Kings World. I actually think I played one of these boss fights earlier this year at GDC? Was a good time, but pretty hard.\nFortnite x Squid Games crossover. All right. Front Man arrives August 26.\nAnd now, more shooter. Lots of gameplay from Delta Force, which launches today on PS5 and Xbox. Free to play, but you probably know that.\nAnd now, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 musical performance! Composer and vocalist are both here to perform \"Alicia\" from the game. Beautiful music! And a nice time for me to catch my breath.\nAbsolutely no time to rest though (or use the bathroom) as the song is done nearly as quickly as it's begun. Now: a look at Ninja Gaiden 4 from Koei Tecmo and PlatinumGames. Absolutely bloody, brutal combat. Awkward dialogue, but that's not exactly what I play Ninja Gaiden so that's fine. October 21 release date, in case you missed it.\nAnd now, a trailer for the open-world MMO tactical shooter from NCsoft which just got the real name of Cinder City. Looks a bit like if Division had way more anime inspiration and giant mechs. Bombastic firepower (and soundtrack in this footage) alongside some kind of strange beast teased for a moment.\nBut that's not all from NCsoft! First-ever look at the gameplay for Time Takers, a team-based third-person shooter. Apparently brings together a group of rogues from across time to fix their past somehow by... competing against each other? Fast-paced shooting and movement is very reminiscent of Apex Legends. Steam playtest coming soon.\nBrand-new look at Silent Hill f from Konami! Suzie Yeung apparently provides the English voice of the main character? Footage shows the young woman waking up in a strange place before being attacked from stalking monsters. She wields a naginata to fend them off. The doors burn mysteriously after she's knocked down.\nAn injured woman wanders around with a pipe inside a warped version of her home. A phone rings. \"It must be hard for you to bid farewell to childhood friends,\" a mysterious character with a fox mask says. Same.\nNo time to linger, though, as we're immediately onto the next thing! Starting with a quote from Dante isn't the way to convince me this isn't a Dante's Inferno remake, but the in-game footage currently being shown of the solid-looking swordplay against a metalbound monstrosity helps.\nLa Divina Commedia (if I read the font correctly?) is what that was. All right. Gonna wait on the press release for that one.\nBloober Team here physically as the Traveler from Cronos: The New Dawn takes the actual stage. Launching September 5, we move into an actual trailer showcasing the Polish locales from the game. Also, there's a kitty cat.\nBut of course, there are also horrifying creatures here. But not the Traveler! Who can seemingly pet the kitty. Abandoned train station, strange glowing orbs, gooey monsters set on fire... Yeah, that's a post-apocalyptic game, all right.\nYou're not alone, however. Which might be a good or bad thing as the trailer shows off other humans and Travelers. But moving right along: next up is Obsidian Entertainment (and specifically Ben Schwartz) to do Outer Worlds 2.\nNew Outer Worlds 2 trailer all about the companions! Niles, Valerie, Aza, Inez, Marisol, Tristan. Looks like they all have different abilities. (And no, you can't sleep with them.) Coming October 29.\nAnd now, a look at inZOI's free DLC coming tomorrow. Sure looks like inZOI.\nAnd now, more anime-style shooters! Fate Trigger early access coming Q1 2026. And then, more actual anime games! Seven Deadly Sins: Origin looks to be an RPG based on the popular manga and anime. Combat and exploration look to be a big part? But hard to say based on just this look.\nAnd now something different: Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, looks like? Early access on October 23.\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. More first-person gameplay mixed with what appear to be cutscenes. Coming October 21! A lot sooner than expected, honestly.\nAnd now, a big chunky update for Enshrouded. \"To find peace, we must brave the deep.\" Be prepared to go swimming, folks. Enshrouded: Wake of the Water is coming in October.\nAge of Empires 4 comes to PlayStation 5, so congratulations to anyone that was waiting. New Dynasties of the East expansion also coming with. November 4, with five days of early access if you pre-order.\nAnd now, something Kingdom Come Deliverance 2! Legacy of the Forge coming September 9. Second story expansion about acquiring and repairing a legendary burnt-down forge.\nNew expansion coming to Cult of the Lamb! Animated trailer leads way to gameplay with Woolhaven expansion coming in 2026. Looks the exact right amount of gross!\nWorld of Warcraft Midnight up now! Holly Longdale, EP and VP, takes the stage. Hypes the new housing feature. \"On the horizon, there's a looming darkness.\" Says the expansion is about hope and light also and about the bonds that tie us together. \"It all starts at the Sunwell.\" Cinematic intro premiere now.\nI've not gone here since Wrath of the Lich King, so the lore implications here are lost on me, but WoW cinematics remain very good. Looks like the Blood Elves are defending the Sunwell while monsters invade. \"Little elves, I can see you grow weary. How much longer can you hold out? Flee, and save yourselves.\" Nice.\nBut she's not fleeing! The Sunwell is instead being used to... power her up? \"I know that I am unworthy. I don't know if I deserve your help, but I know my people do.\" Right on.\nThe Blood Elves are pushed to the brink, but there in the end: the light has come. Allies rise from the Sunwell (?) to defend. There's nothing quite like a good World of Warcraft cinematic, if I'm being honest. Part Two of the Worldsoul Saga, coming 2026. \"What a great cinematic,\" says Keighley.\nNo time to dwell! New game from the Delta Force folks. Geoff said a whole lot of different letters that I didn't catch in sequence, but short version is it seems to be some kind of PvPvE psychological horror game? Lots of gunplay, but haunting atmosphere with creepy dool-like enemies and rundown buildings.\n\"Sometimes loss can birth beasts, and bury truths.\" What if you're the beast? I don't know, man. What if I am? And now we repeat the same scenario as before... but slightly differently? Hm. So, Dead by Daylight-style asymmetrical psychological horror? Sure sounds like it.\nProject Spectrum! \"Let's go back to the start.\" All right, will do.\nAnd now something different from the World of Tanks Wargaming folks. Geoff teased that we'd never seen them do anything like this, but it's literally opened up with more tanks. Maybe slightly more fantastical and cartoonish physics, but still tanks. World of Tanks Heat. Looks kind of like Twisted Metal But Tanks?\nAh, finally some good food. More on Ghost of Yotei! We see our protagonist thinking back to her history while she enters a room. Flash to riding across fields, walking ropes, climbs, fighting in the snow with blood everywhere. Her desire to live and kill her enemies is what drives her on.\nBeautiful vistas, bloody swordplay. \"Ruthless spirits, wandering the land, driven by vengeance. Sometimes I feel like that is what I am.\"\nGhost of Yotei Legends also coming in 2026! Seems like a take on the co-op multiplayer as presented in Ghost of Tsushima?\nAnd now, Resident Evil Requiem. Looks like this might be the capstone here given the timing. Brand-new look that explores the backstory of Grace Ashcroft.\nGrace types on her computer, answers a mysterious phone call confirming it's \"Ms. Ashcroft\" before hanging up. There go the lights... \"They're coming.\"\nHer mom immediately says they need to go and starts trying to grab stuff to leave. \"Tell me what's going on!\" \"Now is not the time.\" I have a sneaking suspicion there will not be time as it transfers to actual gameplay here seamlessly. The two make their way to leave before running into an older gentleman who apologizes for the power outage.... before being attacked and killed from behind.\n\"I promise you, I will explain this all to you one of these days.\" Yeah, that's a red flag right there. They share how much they love each other, before a sudden gasp from Grace \u2013 which certainly seems to spell doom for Grace's mom. Resident Evil Requiem releases February 27, 2026.\n...but there's one last surprise! Global announcement from the Black Myth Wukong folks. Maybe the rumored Black Myth: Zhongkui?\nTwo characters who are down on their luck hide as monstrous beings carrying what looks like a giant sword walk by. A massive tiger being ridden by another character pads to the side. Black Myth Zhongkui it is! New title in the series. The ghost-catching god that wanders between hell and Earth. Geoff teases the journey doesn't end here either.\nAnd that's it! It's over! Thank you to anyone that stuck it out here with me. See you at The Game Awards, huh?"

      "text": "Our first look at Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 shies away from what makes it a vampire RPG, and that has me concerned\nOpinion | The Chinese Room has left me with more questions than answers\nBeating up a wooden mannequin is not my idea of a vampire fantasy. As a result, following the extended Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 gameplay reveal, I'm hopeful for things yet unseen and wary of what we know now. That's a pretty difficult spot to be in, not only for myself as a diehard World of Darkness fan, but for developer The Chinese Room.\nYesterday's longform look at the upcoming vampire RPG was The Chinese Room's first substantial opportunity to show off what it's been working on. Having taken over development from Hardsuit Labs nearly four years ago, this was the Dear Esther studio's first chance to dazzle the skeptics and allay any bubbling concerns held by the more puritanical fans of Troika Games' 2004 original. What we saw was not all bad \u2013 the lighting and environmental detail definitely impressed me \u2013 but showing off this particular moment of the game at such a crucial juncture feels like a strange move.\nCombat-heavy, clunky, and with a bizarre number of non-human enemies, the gameplay reveal showed something more akin to a rough Dishonored pre-alpha than a refined Bloodlines sequel set to launch later this year. It left me wondering why The Chinese Room would show off such basic melee combat, through arguably its least-interesting vampire clan, when it's still yet to show us why Paradox greenlit them to deliver this game in the first place. Hopefully TCR is keeping the good stuff in the oven a little longer, but I can't lie: I fear Bloodlines 2 is already lacking the unbeating heart that made the PC original such a cult classic, and this disconnect from its source material feels risky for a first showing.\nTapping the vein\nBloodlines 2 could remedy the fact that we need more vampires in video games.\nThe embattled project has not had an easy go of it. Bloodlines 2 has three delays and a total restructure under its belt already, but with no concrete release date yet within its 2024 window, I just can't help but wish we'd seen more \u2013 or something else entirely \u2013 during the gameplay reveal.\nI was hoping to see some of the deeper RPG mechanics that Vampire: The Masquerade is known for. Both in its video game offshoots and the TTRPG at its source, the dense lore of the IP is what makes it so exciting. I'm not even mad that Bloodlines 2 is taking a decidedly more action-RPG angle compared to its 20-year-old predecessor (and let's face it, the combat in Bloodlines 1 is nothing special at all) because all of the dev diaries up until this point have reassured me that The Chinese Room, simply put, knows its shit. I have no doubt that it does, having outlined multiple playstyles that would-be Kindred might take advantage of in Bloodlines 2, from stealth to a more hands-off approach that more closely resembles the first game. With the Tremere, Venture, Banu Haqim, and Brujah clans already confirmed as the core four we can expect on day-one, the fact that the extended gameplay reveal didn't show off any character customization has me feeling uneasy.\nOne of the biggest concerns harbored by many returning Bloodlines fans is that, through having a voiced protagonist like Phyre, the roleplaying potential of building and playing your very own vampire has been narrowed considerably. I feel The Chinese Room would have benefited from walking us through the game's RPG DNA before diving into the combat, demonstrating how vampire skills (aka Disciplines) come into play for each of the four vampire clans alongside Phyre's latent Elder vampire abilities. Bloodlines is first and foremost meant to be an RPG after all, but aside from three rather stunted dialogue trees, the extended gameplay reveal doesn't really give that impression. Instead, it focuses on combat.\nDiamond in the rough-and-tumble\nSome elements of Brujah Phyre's fists and teeth-first melee play style really do gel with me. I love ripping the heads off ragdoll enemies as much as the next person, reveling in the satisfying wet thud of fist-meeting-pulpy flesh that punctuates each blow, but none of it feels vampiric in nature. Sinking Phyre's fangs into unsuspecting foes with the tap of the trigger buttons is a nice touch, but in the gameplay reveal, the foes in question are merely illusions that vanish into decidedly corny puffs of blue haze rather than collapsing to the ground. It's something you'd find in a small-budget 90s show, to be honest, and while it makes sense in the context of this scene, it's hardly first look-worthy.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nWith strict controls around a vampire's feeding being such a core tenet of the masquerade itself, it's a little bizarre that instead of taking an opportunity to show choice and consequence in Bloodlines 2, TCR opted with showing us how to beat up a bunch of ghosts and mannequins instead. This, paired with the emotionally-stunted voice acting and often stiff or downright goofy animations, is cause for concern considering the game is slated to launch sometime soon.\nMy hopes at this point are that The Chinese Room takes fan feedback constructively by showing something a bit meatier and, pun intended, higher stakes next time we catch a glimpse of Bloodlines 2. There's still a lot to prove when it comes to how the studio will realize the vampire fantasy, from tone to atmosphere and the meaningful integration of world lore and mechanics. What we've seen so far of Still Wakes the Deep makes me feel optimistic about The Chinese Room's dedication to creating a strong atmospheric presence, bolstered by the developer's grounding in horror games like Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. What would really put fans like me at ease, though, is an earnest display of how that keen eye for detail and world-building factors into its vision for the gritty, immersive vampire RPG that I know TCR wants to \u2013 and can \u2013 deliver.\nCheck out some more new games for 2024 to slake your thirst.\nJasmine is a staff writer at GamesRadar+.

      "text": "Baldur's Gate 3 boss Swen Vincke shares the RPG love, predicts the long-awaited Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 \"is going to be big\"\nAfter a two decade hiatus\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is a certified cult classic, so there are obviously some fans in the industry who were enamoured by its toothy chops two decades ago. Larian Studios boss and Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke seems to be one of those, as he recently shared the RPG love with the really long-awaited sequel: Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2.\n\"This game is going to be big - really cool,\" Vincke tweeted after presumably seeing or playing the game at Gamescom 2025.\nNo surprise, either. GamesRadar+'s hands-on preview of Bloodlines 2 at the convention was similarly impressed. \"It's this commitment to narrative and worldbuilding that impresses above all else,\" our Andrew Brown wrote. \"The original Bloodlines became a cult classic thanks to its richly-realized setting and narrative, and to see The Chinese Room focus on those same hallmarks is deeply affirming. Are we back?\"\nVincke's not the only big-name dev crossing their fingers for the gothic sequel's success. Former Dragon Age maestro David Gaider previously hoped the follow-up would be \"in the same line as Expedition 33 or Baldur's Gate 3\" - and thought it would be really exciting for the genre if Bloodlines 2 could deliver a great RPG experience \"that wasn't beholden to the fantasy or sci-fi genre,\" as is usual.\nHelldivers 2 CEO Shams Jorjani was also excited about the game after signing it at a different company 10 years ago, as he wished the game \"sticks the landing\" following a troubled development.\nWhatever turbulent waters Bloodlines 2 went through seems to be over now since it finally has an October 21, 2025 release date.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nKaan freelances for various websites including Rock Paper Shotgun, Eurogamer, and this one, Gamesradar.

      "text": "New Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines 2 dev won't say exactly what happened in the 10 years since Helldivers 2 boss bought it at Paradox, just that \"we basically started again\": \"The two games are not alike\"\nPerpetually undead\nWhile I'm sure having a stranger's teeth plunged into your neck and waking up as a frightfully gorgeous vampire person is a harrowing experience in its own right, you have to admit, the developers behind Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 haven't had the easiest time, either. I'm not surprised that The Chinese Room, which recently left Sumo Digital to operate independently, doesn't want to discuss it.\nAs the story with many games stuck in perpetual limbo goes, Bloodlines 2 was supposed to come out a few years ago. Helldivers 2 boss Shams Jorjani was originally involved in signing the game to Paradox while he was an executive there in 2016, but the game has skipped milestones since then like a pebble across lakewater: it was going to come out in 2019, then it was delayed in 2020, then it was delayed indefinitely, exhumed in 2023, and, finally, it's meant to come out at some point this year. In a new Game Informer interview, currently available only to subscribers, creative director Alex Skidmore is vague about the moments in between.\n\"The two games are not alike,\" Skidmore says about the Bloodlines 2 Paradox started with and the one it has now. \"We have the code base and everything, but we basically started again because we had a very different vision, I think.\"\n\"There's more visceral combat,\" he explains, though \"we share Seattle,\" Skidmore says of Bloodlines 2's Christmastime location. \"Some of the art we used to give us a sort of leap forward.\"\nBut \"we very much wanted to make it our own game,\" Skidmore concludes.

      "text": "I didn't dare to dream, but playing Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has convinced me this gloomy RPG is still worth waiting for\nHands-on preview | Two hours in this long (long, long) awaited sequel reveals a brilliant focus on writing, dialogue, and spooky Seattle\n\"It's good to want things, but that dream is over,\" croons a gothic late-night radio jockey in Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2. He's talking about holiday plans \u2013 a snowstorm has effectively shut down Seattle, trapping its unknowing residents within a supernatural turf war \u2013 but my mind cynically goes to Bloodlines 2 itself.\nThe sequel to Troika Games' gothic cult classic RPG has been delayed and passed around so often that I had long given up on playing it, let alone hoping it would hit the same highs as the first game. Which is why, having recently played Bloodlines 2's opening hours, I'm more than a little surprised to say The Chinese Room may have a bona fide winner on its hands.\nBack from the grave\nIn the basement of a run-down apartment block, elder vampire protagonist Phyre has just woken up from a hundred-year sleep. I'm warned the slumber has left Phyre a little weak, but against the hapless security guards and Ghouls (humans who have had a taste of vampire blood) inhabiting the rest of the building, he feels anything but. Scuttling through grimy corridors and over rotting rafters, Bloodlines 2 points out all the things that vampires do better.\nPhyre can double-jump, glide, and scramble up walls; with the added verticality proving incredibly handy. I'm forced to hide from a squad of cops who turn up to look for two missing security guards, as preserving the Masquerade \u2013 vampire society's rules for remaining hidden \u2013 is as important as feeding (speaking of which, check the basement for those guards). But away from prying eyes, Phyre can punch enemies halfway across a room, use telekinesis, and pulp heads with his bare hands.\nIt's all very gnarly, which sucks for the Ghouls I meet on the way out of the apartment block. However, combat is hard to get a read on at this stage. Phyre can use light and heavy punches to stagger foes to be fed upon or executed, and although it certainly feels powerful, it's all very one-note.\nThat said, it also seems like it's designed to be padded out as you level up, with powerful abilities locked behind skill point requirements. I suspect combat will be an entirely different beast when you've got more tools to use \u2013 even within an hour of picking the magic-wielding Tremere clan, I was using blood magic to boil enemies' insides until they turned into walking bombs.\nOne thing I do like, at least in these early hours, is how much the whole thing feels like Dishonored. You're a superhuman, yes, but can easily be brought down with pure numbers. Stealth, or at least picking your fights carefully, is crucial. There are a few fights I had to attempt multiple times after leaving the apartment, including one memorable brawl with a dive bar's Ghoul patrons.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nAfter a few attempts that ended up with me being unceremoniously beaten to death with a baseball bat, I finally pulled it off through shock and awe \u2013 tearing out one Ghoul's throat while he was leaning over the jukebox, then rounding on the rest before they could organize. In a separate scrap, I used telekinesis to grab someone's revolver and remotely shoot it back at them. There are some excellent foundations here, so I sincerely hope I'm only looking at the early stages of a slower-burn RPG combat system.\nOut and a bat\nSee what lies ahead in our roundup of upcoming RPGs.\nThe true star of the show is Seattle itself. This isn't a \"big, open world\" as The Chinese Room has already outlined, and instead is more like the original Bloodlines' zone-based slice of Los Angeles.\nLike combat, I don't entirely know how this will click with the broader game \u2013 I didn't spot any side quests available in this build \u2013 and while I'm hoping the smaller size means we'll get some real density, Seattle itself is incredibly impressive. Set during a snowstorm in the run-up to Christmas, the city is gorgeous and captures the same nocturnal melancholy as its predecessor. Nobody really wants to be outside in the storm \u2013 not the cop counting down the minutes until his shift ends, certainly not the office worker-turned-midnight snack \u2013 while most of the vampires I meet are tucked away, looking down on the city from glitzy skyscrapers.\nThere are ways to move around Seattle quicker \u2013 like climbing up walls to run over rooftops, or using your vampiric powers to run inhumanly quickly \u2013 but both break the Masquerade if you're seen, and on two occasions I had to lose cops down snowy back-alleys. I didn't see any punishments for breaking the Masquerade (though escaping from the police may have avoided that); but given it has its own stealth meter-esque UI and its importance is stressed by every vampire in town, it remains to be seen how it's going to be enforced.\nLook past the glittering Christmas trees and oh-so cozy snow, and Seattle is a supernatural powder keg. Bloodlines 2's story opens with the city on the precipice, with Seattle's vampiric leadership reeling from coordinated attacks across the city. Meanwhile, Phyre has awoken with the voice of fast-talking vampire detective Fabien in his head, and they're both as keen as the other to work out why they're sharing a brain. Throw in the fact that Phyre needs to seek permission to stay in Seattle \u2013 hooray for vampire bureaucracy \u2013 and the opening hours are part noir detective thriller, half schmoozefest with the city's ruling vamps.\nA surprisingly intricate dialogue system helps both halves shine. When picking conversation options, a message in the top-right corner of the screen perceives how the person you're talking to reacts to the topic. Asking Seattle's former Prince (ruling vampire) about why they handed the city's reigns over, and they'll get irritated. I refused to be intimidated by an aggressive Sheriff enforcing the Masquerade, and instead of becoming confrontational, he was impressed by my implied strength.\n\"Good job matching his macho,\" comments Fabien afterward. Later, while Fabien's briefing me on a vampire I'm about to meet, he mentions off-hand that they're also a Tremere. Closing out my hands-on with a flashback to one of Fabien's memories, I use a range of vampiric abilities \u2013 think mind-reading and using illusion to disguise my appearance \u2013 to interrogate and investigate my way through a night shift as a Seattle detective.\nEven outside of conversation, similarly small details meant I slowed down my playthrough to relish it all. Examining a rotting cat identified an audible wetness suggesting larvae are flourishing in its mouth. I hung around in an apartment lobby to listen to a late night \"confessional\" talk show, which began with one caller trying to get the host to sell beeswax in a multi-level marketing scheme, and ended with another caller who suspects his dead wife might not be dead after all.\nIt's this commitment to narrative and worldbuilding that impresses above all else. The original Bloodlines became a cult classic thanks to its richly-realized setting and narrative, and to see The Chinese Room focus on those same hallmarks is deeply affirming. Are we back? It's still too early to say. I didn't see enough of Seattle's open world to get a feel for how lively it will be outside of the main story, or how much skill trees will improve combat. But the beating heart of Bloodlines 2 is already far, far juicier than I'd dared to hope for.\nLook ahead to more future releases in our roundup of new games for 2025 (and beyond).\nAndy Brown is the Features Editor of Gamesradar+, and joined the site in June 2024.

Cyberpunk 2077 was a highly anticipated game for years, and it landed with hundreds of hours of gameplay and plenty of secrets to find in the sprawling, dystopian open world. Whether you're looking for builds, weapons, mission choices, romance options, endings explained, or something else entirely, we've got it covered with over 60 individual articles. This is our complete Cyberpunk 2077 guide and we'd recommend bookmarking it, because you'll need it. Good luck, choom.\nCyberpunk 2077 review\nFirst up is our Cyberpunk 2077 review, from GamesRadar+ brand director (previously editor), Sam Loveridge. We gave it the GR seal of approval with a 5/5, saying that Cyberpunk 2077, \"takes everything we celebrate about open-world games, and learns from it, implementing best-in-class variations in a world that's so dense and detailed. Add in the human-like level of reactivity and emotional depth that it brings to its narrative, and it all combines for the most spectacular experience\".\nCyberpunk 2077 tips\nOur Cyberpunk 2077 tips are the sort of things you want to read before you even step foot in Night City. We've got 13 tips here that'll help your V get off to a flying start, from simple pointers to outside-the-box stuff you wouldn't realise until hours into the game otherwise.\nHow long to beat Cyberpunk 2077?\nThe Cyberpunk 2077 length obviously depends on how much you engage with the many side missions and activities, your exploration, your difficulty and more - while the main story isn't that long, it's a dense open world RPG, so you'll almost certainly spend a lot of time exploring off the beaten path. Knowing how many acts are in Cyberpunk 2077 can at least help you track where you roughly are overall, whether you're focused on rolling the credits or just seeing what comes along next.\nIt's worth flagging that there is still no Cyberpunk 2077 new game plus mode for after you complete the game. At this point it seems highly unlikely that CD Projekt Red will add such an option either.\nCyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty expansion\nIf you want to know more about Cyberpunk 2077's first and only expansion, be sure to check out our separate Phantom Liberty guide - the expansion is pretty much a whole game in and of itself, adding many more hours of missions and activities to Cyberpunk 2077.\nSince the release of Phantom Liberty, there have been two substantial updates for the base game - the Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 update focused on completely overhauling the game's systems, while the Cyberpunk 2077 2.1 update focused more on quality-of-life and immersive features to enhance the overall experience.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nCyberpunk 2077 character customization and builds\nV can be extensively customized during your time in Cyberpunk 2077. The first major choice you'll make (which cannot be changed at a later point) is your Cyberpunk 2077 Lifepath, which determines your V's background and position in Night City. You also get to customize your appearance at the start of the game, with a huge array of options available, but you can also change appearance in Cyberpunk 2077 later on for free. If you want to change your outfit, be sure to access a Cyberpunk 2077 wardrobe too.\nAs you level up and unlock perks, upgrading your attributes and get better gear, you can lean into particular playstyles or aspects of the game's systems to craft the best Cyberpunk 2077 builds, allowing you to battle the dangers of Night City's however you please. There is also a Cyberpunk 2077 respec option if you need to refine some of your perk choices and attributes, though there are some limitations. However, the Cyberpunk 2077 level cap is pretty high, which means you'll end up with a lot of perks anyway, so you should easily get what you need for an optimal build.\nCyberpunk 2077 weapons\nIf your build is starting to take shape, now you need some of the best Cyberpunk 2077 weapons to synergize nicely and blow away your foes. The Cyberpunk 2077 Mantis Blades are arguably the most recognisable cyber weapon you can get in the game, so you should definitely try and get them quickly. If you're looking for a good melee build weapon, the Cyberpunk 2077 Errata katana is a deadly option for slicing and dicing. Conversely, the Cyberpunk 2077 Skippy pistol is a decent smart pistol that also happens to be smarter than your average gun.\nHowever, this game isn't all about going in guns blazing all the time, so you should know how to holster your weapons in Cyberpunk 2077 too.\nCyberpunk 2077 Hacking\nNaturally, hacking is a pretty big part of Cyberpunk 2077, especially if you're running an Intelligence-focused build, though it's not always straightforward. Follow our Cyberpunk 2077 hacking guide to learn all about quickhacks, jacking into computers, and more. You can use hacking to steal money and materials from machines, distract enemies, or attack remotely to deal damage, such as with the Cyberpunk 2077 Overheat hack.\nCyberpunk 2077 money\nNight City uses Eurodollars - or Eddies - as its currency, and you'll earn a decent amount of them from completing main and side missions, but it's good to know how to make money in Cyberpunk 2077 to get rich quickly. You'll also need a lot of them, as some of the best vehicles, weapons, cyberware, and more are going to require you to cough up plenty of Eddies.\nCyberpunk 2077 cars and vehicles\nDriving around Night City is key to getting around, especially if you're not really using fast travel. You'll therefore want to know about the fastest cars in Cyberpunk 2077 to ensure you're zipping through the city between missions as fast as possible. However, if you're not at a point where you can afford fast vehicles, you should also learn how to steal cars in Cyberpunk 2077 too. As a quick tip, the Cyberpunk 2077 Ken Block car can be easily obtained early on for free and it's weaponized!\nCyberpunk 2077 map and fast travel\nThe Cyberpunk 2077 map and fast travel system will help you navigate the huge city you have to explore. There's a range of areas, city districts and fast travel kiosks to discover and learn about, so use this guide to get all the info you need.\nCyberpunk 2077 story missions\nSPOILER WARNING: these guides are all related to the story, some more than others. This means there will be spoilers from here onwards. Some will be minor, some will be major, but stop reading here if you want to play the story without knowing anything.\n- One of the first missions you can approach from multiple angles is Cyberpunk 2077 The Pickup mission. You've got to acquire a robot from Maelstrom with your partner Jackie, but there are many different ways to resolve what happens.\n- During The Pickup mission, there's an optional objective to rescue Brick, the ex-leader of Maelstrom who's been locked away. Here's how to free brick in Cyberpunk 2077 if you wan to try and save him.\n- The Cyberpunk 2077 The Information braindance is the first time you try this new VR surveillance experience. It can be confusing, but you must sift through the footage to scope out Arasaka Tower and find clues.\n- One decision you'll need to make in the prologue is deciding should you cut Dex out in Cyberpunk 2077 or not, or tell Dex that Evelyn wanted to cut him out during The Heist mission.\n- The Cyberpunk 2077 Angel or Skye choice comes during the Automatic Love mission where you have the option of picking... company, at the Clouds reception desk.\n- Depending on how your experience at Clouds goes, you may also have to complete the Cyberpunk 2077 interrogate Woodman objective.\n- You'll absolutely want to hit Fingers the second you meet him but should you punch Fingers in Cyberpunk 2077? This used to be quite an important choice, but thankfully beating the creep doesn't have the negative consequences it used to.\n- You'll need to grab the Death's Head Moth Braindance during the Cyberpunk 2077 Disasterpiece mission with Judy, but you've got a few ways to approach getting this dark BD.\n- During the I Walk The Line mission, there are a few ways you can deal with the Cyberpunk 2077 NetWatch Agent.\n- Once you've dealt with the NetWatch Agent, I Walk The Line also sees you make the Cyberpunk 2077 Brigitte chip choice, though it's not really a choice, and more of a way to pause the mission.\n- Towards the end of the main story, you'll participate in the Search and Destroy mission with everyone's favorite Arasaka henchman, Goro Takemura. However, he meets an unfortunate end unless you know how to save Takemura in Cyberpunk 2077 with a secret optional objective.\nCyberpunk 2077 side gigs\nSide Gigs are Cyberpunk 2077's answer to side missions, and there are loads of them to complete across Night City. From short missions featuring unique characters to involved multi-mission threads and collectibles, here are some of the most notable ones you'll probably pick up on your merc journey:\n- The Cyberpunk 2077 Happy Together mission begins shortly after you leave your apartment for the first time. You'll start it when you can talk to the NCPD officers trying to speak to someone who lives below you. It's very easy to get the bad ending here, so follow our explainer to ensure you have the best outcome.\n- The Cyberpunk 2077 The Gig mission should be simple - all you need to do is wait for lockdown to end and then collect two rewards from Wakako and Cassius Ryder. It's simple in practice but not super clear.\n- The Cyberpunk 2077 Human Nature mission is another objective you can get shortly after the prologue, and it involves getting your car back after Delamain \u2013 an AI driving assistant \u2013 went rogue and crashed into your car. You'll encounter them a few times, including having to deal with the Cyberpunk 2077 Delamain core.\n- The Cyberpunk 2077 kill Grayson choice comes up in the Chippin' In side gig. Sparing him is definitely useful, but thankfully doesn't lock you out of the great reward you find when you use the access card.\n- For the Cyberpunk 2077 Dream On side gig, you need to help the Peralezes by investigating their apartment for unusual activity as they suspect that something just isn't quite right.\n- Cyberpunk 2077 tarot cards are found all throughout Night City. These interesting graffiti art pieces are of interest to Misty with her affinity for the arcane.\n- Cyberpunk 2077 Cyberpsychos terrorize the citizens of Night City, and even though MaxTac is out and about, it's often V that's got to deal with them.\nCyberpunk 2077 romance options\nThere are four Cyberpunk 2077 romance options for you to pursue across the game, though you won't be able to engage in all of them as your character creator options will lock you out of one or two of the romance partners. I'm sure you can still be friends though!\nCyberpunk 2077 endings\nHUGE spoiler warning for the guides here!\nIf you want to know what your options are for Cyberpunk 2077 endings, or you want to understand exactly what just happened in your ending or the ones you missed, then there are quite a lot to go through - remember, there's also the latest ending added with Phantom Liberty! We've laid them all out in the linked guide, including the Cyberpunk 2077 secret ending for those that want a serious endgame challenge.\nCyberpunk 2077 secrets and Easter eggs\nIf you want to find the Cyberpunk 2077 Hideo Kojima cameo then we can point out the mission and place where you can find him. You can find him quite early on, although he's not highlighted in anyway and you could completely miss him if you're not looking out.\nGrimes also appears in the game, though as a much more prominent character known as Lizzy-Wizzy - a famous pop star in the world of Cyberpunk 2077 who even has her own questline. But to begin all that, you'll need to know where to find Grimes in Cyberpunk 2077 first, though be aware that she does also pop up briefly in Phantom Liberty too.\nIf you're after more companionship in the form of a friendly feline, then you need to know how to get Nibbles the cat in Cyberpunk 2077. Like real cats, Nibbles won't warm to you immediately, but feeding them the right food is a good start.\nCyberpunk 2077 mods\nSPOILER WARNING: these guides are all related to the main story. This means there will be spoilers from here onwards. Some will be minor, some will be major, so stop reading here if you want to play without knowing anything.\n\u00a9 GamesRadar+. Not to be reproduced without permission.\nGive me a game and I will write every \"how to\" I possibly can or die trying. When I'm not knee-deep in a game to write guides on, you'll find me hurtling round the track in F1, flinging balls on my phone in Pokemon Go, pretending to know what I'm doing in Football Manager, or clicking on heads in Valorant.\n- Leon HurleyManaging editor for guides\n- Will SawyerGuides Writer"

      "text": "So, how do we go about achieving this? We focus on immersion over complexity: A streamlined control scheme with actions that are easy for all three playstyles to pick up and play. We then build depth on top of these to give longer-term mastery for the players that want it. For example, the defensive mechanic is a dash, allowing players to dodge incoming attacks or reposition. If dodge is used towards an enemy performing a melee attack, it becomes a counter, staggering the enemy - it is fine for players to never do this move, but for those that want a higher skill-ceiling, it is there. How we use abilities is also streamlined, to maintain immersion. Abilities are mapped to the face buttons (on gamepad), limiting the player to 4 available at one time. This is a small enough amount that a player can use them without breaking their flow, but also deep enough, through the different ways you can combine and use them that it keeps combat engaging and fun.\nAll of this serves our principal of Immersive Combat. We would rather players were thinking about what cool thing they want to do next, rather than how they do it.\nVisceral Combat is a stylistic choice we have made as we believe being a vampire should be a bloody business. Feeding plays a huge role in any vampire story and we wanted to give you a cool reason to tear out throats in the middle of a fight. As an Elder vampire, Phyre has become desensitised to violence, and we want the same to happen to the player over the course of the game - maybe being shocked the first time they chop someone's head off, but after a while accepting that violent carnage is par-for-the-course when you are a 400 hundred year old vampire in a city where everyone is out to get you.\nThe final game pillar in Bloodlines 2 is \u201cExploring the World of Darkness\u201d. I look forward to talking to you about that in the next dev-diary.\nGood night!\nAlex Skidmore, Project Creative Director\nWhat\u2019s Next\nAs Alex mentions above, the next dev diary will be on the third pillar \u2018Exploring the World of Darkness\u2019, coming in two weeks. Before that you'll be able to see how everything comes together when we debut our gameplay trailer and deep dive on January 31."

BG3 is an incredibly deep and broad game, and it's easy to find confusing or difficult elements within that - or just want a clue about the best to handle things going forward when you want to make a friend. From Astarion to Zevlor, everything you need to know about Baldur's Gate 3 is waiting just below!\nBaldur's Gate 3 platforms\nBaldur's Gate 3 is out now on PC, Mac, and PS5. As for whether we'll see Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox and Switch, we have all the details there.\nIs there Baldur's Gate 3 multiplayer support?\nThere is Baldur's Gate 3 multiplayer support, with online functionality that let you play with friends, or anyone hosting a game. Players can choose between couch co-op or online co-op to take friends on a journey with them\nDoes Baldur's Gate 3 support cross-save progression?\nWhen it comes to crossplay, Larian has stated \"Baldur's Gate 3 will support cross-save progression between PC, Mac, and PS5\u2026 Allowing you to transfer your saves between platforms and continue your adventure wherever you purchase the game.\"\nHowever, Baldur's Gate 3 early access saves are not be carried across to the full game. You'll have to find your Baldur's Gate 3 save location and delete any early access save to play the full release.\nDifficulty explained\nDeciding on a Baldur's Gate 3 difficulty will be your first big decision. There's Explorer, Normal, or Tactician to chose from, essentially translating to story mode, default and hard.\nCharacter creation\nThere is a lot to take in while making your Baldur's Gate 3 character. Things like a Baldur's Gate 3 background letting you choose between things like light-fingered Urchins to Acolytes, Criminals, and Folk Heroes, and more with your background providing experience-based extras linked to your character's past.\nThen there's the big one, your best Baldur's Gate 3 class and Baldur's Gate 3 races which will obviously decide your power set, abilities and specialties. There's a lot of complicated interplays that can shape your character so you want all the info you can get.\nThere's also Baldur's Gate 3 skills and we can tell you more there from the basics of your character's skills, including how each one might play out in the game and which will benefit you the most. It's a core tenet of any good DND build, and the same goes for Baldur's Gate 3. If you're not too savvy on your skills just yet, we can help you change that.\nCompanions\nOnce you've made your character and set out into the world you'll need to think about which Baldur's Gate 3 companions you want with you. You'll meet far more than the four you can have in your Baldur's Gate 3 party and getting the right mix is important. The companions you have with you party forms the basis of your battles and their requisite skills will come in handy at certain times.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nRomance\nObviously once you have some companions and are spending some time with them then the chance for some Baldur's Gate 3 romances will pop up. Larian describes this potential for love in the game as \"reactive systems all throughout the journey of a relationship,\" along with \"hundreds of permutations that define where a relationship heads.\"\nThe short version of that is any potential relationship will depend on how people view almost anything you do. Companions will form opinions of you based on your actions, dialogue choices, and who you choose to form alliances. Romancing some companions might have a negative impact on your relationships with others, so be aware of that when you settle down to make camp each night.\nSpells\nCombat uses a wide range of Baldur's Gate 3 spells to defeat enemies. These can be pure offense, buffs and debuffs, tricks, traps and more. Depending upon the class and race of your character, your innate magical strengths and weaknesses will dictate which spells you are able to wield so you want to pick the best.\nWeapons\nAs well as using spells, your Baldur's Gate 3 weapons come in handy for hand-to-hand combat. Some weapons are magical, some ordinary and others can only be acquired by completing a specific quest line. With so many out there to collect and choose from, check out the guide for an in-depth look.\nHow to long and short rest\nBaldur's Gate 3 long and short rests are a vital part of survival and what you pick all depends on how much health and skill replenishment you need. You can take up to two short rests per day before needing a long rest in the evening, where you are transported to a safe campfire ground to regroup with your companions. Our guide on how to take long rests or short rests in Baldur's Gate 3 will help you work it it.\nHow to revive the dead\nWhen it comes to reviving the dead in Baldur's Gate 3, you'll need a specific item or spell. Namely, the Scroll of Revivify or the Revivify spell. Our guide will explain how to get your hands on both and make sure death is only a temporary inconvenience.\nMore Baldur's Gate 3 guides:\n- How to highlight objects in Baldur's Gate 3\n- what advantage and disadvantage means in Baldur's Gate 3\n- How to dual-wield weapons in Baldur's Gate 3\n- Baldur's Gate 3 level cap\nBaldur's Gate 3 walkthroughs\nRemove or destroy the brain?\nIt's the first choice you're faced with: should you remove or destroy the brain in Baldur's Gate 3? Destroying it will effectively skip the tutorial help, so we suggest not doing that if this is your first time playing. What happens when you free it, and should you mutilate it? Well, check the guide to find out.\nHow to free Shadowheart from the pod\nIf you're wondering how to free Shadowheart from the pod in Baldur's Gate 3 then we can breakdown everything you need to do to get her out.

It's a rock. However, it's a rock the game singles out and can only reveal the reward it hides if you know what to do.\nBaldur's Gate 3 hag\nIf you're having trouble beating the Baldur's Gate 3 hag, Auntie Ethel, our guide will set you straight. This hideous creature is holding Mayrina hostage, and it's up to you to rescue her from Ethel's foul clutches. The above guide will walk you through how to deal with Auntie Ethel - whatever you do, don't take her first deal unless you want to lose an eye!\nBaldur's Gate 3 moon puzzle\nSolving the Baldur's Gate 3 moon puzzle can be tricky, but our guide will help you work it out.

The tips we give in the above guide will make the Defiled Temple moon puzzle that much more approachable.\nBaldur's Gate 3 cellar\nGetting into the Baldur's Gate 3 cellar beneath the blighted village is a lengthier process than you might think. Not only do you have to do a little interior decorating to access the entrance, but a battle or two awaits you below. The guide above will help you find and access the cellar in Baldur's Gate 3, as well as what to say to the Ornate Mirror once confronted with it.\nBaldur's Gate 3 Owlbear cub\nThe Baldur's Gate 3 owlbear cub is a creature you could come across a few times in your playthrough.

The twisted underworld is just one way to access the Moonrise Towers, but how you actually get down there is another story altogether. You'll want to be at least a level three before venturing to the Underdark, but if that's you ticked off already, we have more tips for what to expect down there.\nBaldur's Gate 3 Dank Crypt\nNavigating the Baldur's Gate 3 Dank Crypt is tricky business. The trap you'll find down there is something fresh out of Saw, with the room filling with a mystery black grease as all the doors fuse shut. If you're stumped on how to get out, our guide will help you find and meet Withers in the Dank Crypt!\nBaldur's gate 3 Nautiloid ship\nFeeling a little stumped and wondering what to do after the Baldur's Gate 3 Nautiloid ship crash? Our guide has a few ideas, including fully mapped out instructions to take the bewilderment out of it.\nBaldur's Gate 3 Bane\nWondering why you keep getting affected by Bane in Baldur's Gate 3?

Here's how to deal with Bane and get rid of it for good.\nBaldur's Gate 3 Karlach\nShe's a new companion and romance option, so if you're wondering how to find Karlach in Baldur's Gate 3, we'll make it easy for you. The Tiefling NPC rears her head in the Hunt the Devil quest, where you'll get the chance to side with her or someone else in a rather sizeable choice moment. The early access version sees her added to your party as a companion rather than a romance option, but since the full version allows you to woo her as well, our guide to finding Karlach in Baldur's Gate 3 will bring you a little closer to winning her devilish heart.\nBaldur's Gate 3 Necromancy of Thay choice\nWhen faced with the Baldur's Gate 3 Necromany of Thay key choice, what should you do? You can either destroy it entirely, or open the book using your newly-found key. This choice leads to two very different outcomes, so if you're unsure which path to take, our guide lets you in on the outcomes of both.\nBaldur's Gate 3 Halsin's location\nIf you want to find Baldur's Gate 3's Halsin in the Goblin Camp, we'll show you just how to do that.

Whether Jasmine is researching the latest in gaming litigation for a news piece, writing how-to guides for The Sims 4, or extolling the necessity of a Resident Evil: CODE Veronica remake, you'll probably find her listening to metalcore at the same time.\n- Leon HurleyManaging editor for guides"

  "argos_summary": "Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 has finally secured an October\u202f21\u202f2025 release after a long history of delays and a studio change to The Chinese Room, which is re\u2011imagining the 2004 classic with first\u2011person combat, multiple playstyles, and a customizable elder vampire protagonist named Phyre. The game promises to blend the original\u2019s narrative depth with modern action\u2011RPG mechanics, but early reveals have drawn criticism for being too combat\u2011heavy and for limiting character choice, while a day\u2011one DLC that adds new clans has sparked backlash from fans. The article also surveys a wide slate of other 2025 RPGs, touches on the Baldur\u2019s Gate\u202f3 Dark Urge origin, and notes the broader context of upcoming releases and industry reactions.",
