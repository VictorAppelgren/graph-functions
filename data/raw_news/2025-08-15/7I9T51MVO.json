  "content": "NEED TO KNOW\n\u2022 None A 46-year-old man was rescued by helicopter after he was trapped behind a waterfall for two days in the Sequoia National Forest on Aug. 12\n\u2022 None He was treated for minor injuries and dehydration\n\u2022 None \"He didn\u2019t know if he was ever going to get out of there,\" a rescuer said\n\nA missing 46-year-old California man was found safe, but dehydrated, after he was trapped for two days behind a raging waterfall in the Sequoia National Forest, authorities said.\n\nOn Sunday, Aug. 10, Ryan Wardwell planned to rappel the Seven Teacups waterfalls near the North Fork of the Kern River in California, but didn\u2019t return to his car by late Sunday night, the Tulare County Sheriff's Office said in a statement obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nWardwell had hiked to the top of the falls with four friends, who decided to turn back after seeing the power of the rushing water, California Highway Patrol flight officer paramedic Mike Crane told the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nBut Wardwell, who had rappelled the waterfalls four times before, decided to go on his own. After his friends got back to the trailhead, they left a note on his car, telling people nearby to report Wardwell as missing if his vehicle was still there the next day, the paper reported.\n\nBy Monday, Aug. 11, the sheriff\u2019s office received reports that Wardwell was missing and was last seen at the top of the Seven Teacups waterfalls the evening prior.\n\nAfter an extensive search of the area, \u201cusing aircraft equipped with camera and infrared technology,\u201d emergency responders were able to locate the missing man\u2019s possible location, but it was too late to rescue him. Officials planned to return \u201cat first light\u201d the next day when it was safer.\n\nOn the morning of Tuesday, Aug. 12, a drone found Wardwell alive behind a large waterfall. The man told deputies that \u201che had come off his rappel lines and got trapped behind the waterfall because of the extreme hydraulics of the river,\" officials said.\n\nWardwell had stationed himself in a dark cave beneath the waterfall, where he huddled, soaking wet, for two days, the Chronicle reported.\n\n\u201cHe tried for days to escape, but there was nothing he could do to break through,\u201d Capt. Kevin Kemmerling of the Tulare County Sheriff\u2019s Office told the outlet. \u201cThere was no way for him to warm up or dry out in there, so it had to have been miserable.\u201d\n\nA member of the rescue team was lowered down into the waterfall from the helicopter, secured Wardwell, before both men were hoisted to safety, authorities said. Officials described it as a \u201cstunning survival story\u201d and shared footage of the rescuer being carefully lowered to the cave entrance and the extraction of the two men.\n\n\u201cI got the impression that maybe he didn\u2019t know if he was ever going to get out of there,\u201d Crane, who operated the hoist and spoke to Wardwell after his rescue, told the Chronicle.\n\nOnce Wardwell was on a dry landing zone, he received treatment for minor injuries and dehydration. Members of his family were there, waiting for him.\n\nThe Seven Teacups is a string of pools created by the strong currents of Dry Meadow Creek, according to AllTrails. Hikers are not advised to continue into the pools \u201cwithout extensive canyoneering experience and proper equipment,\u201d according to the hiking guide.\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nAfter the death-defying incident, officials urged people to be aware of their experience level and the surrounding environment before venturing into white-water rivers.",
