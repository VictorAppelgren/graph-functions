  "content": "Visitors attend the opening reception for \u201cJourney Through the Maze: 45 Years of PAC-MAN.\u201d The exhibit runs through Sept. 28 at Great Park Gallery.\n\nA simple circle colored yellow with a piece taken out, and four colored \u201cghosts,\u201d sparked a cultural phenomenon in 1980 that remains 45 years later.\n\nEven if you\u2019ve never played PAC-MAN, the maze-themed video game designed by Namco (now Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc.), you can likely envision this tiny character that became big in the \u201980s.\n\n\u201cSince the official introduction, PAC-MAN sparked a worldwide phenomenon that attracted multiple generation of players across genders,\u201d said Susan Tran, senior director of Brand Development for PAC-MAN at Bandai Namco Entertainment America Inc. in Irvine. \u201cIts popularity led to several game sequels, a full merchandising program and hit music single as well as two animated television series.\n\n\u201cWith record-breaking achievements, PAC-MAN has been recognized by the Guinness World Records with awards such as Most Successful Coin-Operated Game. Bandai Namco continues to release new console and mobile games and this year, PAC-MAN commemorates its 45th anniversary with a variety of partnerships, activations and launches.\u201d\n\nPart of the celebration is an exhibit running through Sept. 28 at Great Park Gallery in Irvine called \u201cJourney Through the Maze: 45 Years of PAC-MAN,\u201d featuring artwork and memorabilia from Bandai Namco as well as more than 50 professional artists from all over the world.\n\nThere are arcade cabinets with classic gameplay experiences, a timeline history of the game\u2019s evolution, reproductions of original drawings, interactive displays and other activities. In May, there was a \u201cPAC-MAN Pixel Drawing and Collage\u201d event and in July, a PAC-MAN-themed fingerboarding (miniature skateboarding) experience with custom mini skate parks. This month featured a \u201cGaming Through the Ages\u201d panel discussion with the artists featured in the exhibit.\n\n\u201cA lot of them were mentioning and talked about [in the panel] just how simple it is, but how anxiety-inducing that game was and that\u2019s what made it so memorable and addictive because it was so simple and iconic,\u201d said San Diego artist Patrick Ballesteros, who is featured in the exhibit, helped curate some of the other artists and led the recent panel. \u201cYou just watch this little person go across the screen getting food, trying to avoid ghosts, and that was the whole game. But you were there hours and hours and you remember being a kid in there. \u2026 You were just putting quarters in trying to move on to the next level, not knowing if there was ever an end. I think that\u2019s the part that connected [a lot] of these artists is because we all remembered playing the game and the actual arcade.\u201d\n\nHe said it was very different back then compared to now, where players have online and console gaming.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the part that has kind of elevated PAC-MAN is that we have the old-schoolers like us doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then we also introduced it to our kids, who now understand PAC-MAN and it still has that appeal.\u201d\n\nAdam Sabolick, program coordinator for arts and exhibitions for the city of Irvine and PAC-MAN exhibit curator, said the gallery does three exhibitions a year, ranging from historic topics to pop culture and contemporary art.\n\n\u201cIt just seemed like a perfect fit for one of those kind of pop culture shows,\u201d Sabolick said of selecting PAC-MAN as an exhibit theme. \u201cI also think there\u2019s a timelessness to the game in that it would resonate with, obviously, people who grew up in the \u201880s playing PAC-MAN, but also, I\u2019m in my mid-thirties, when I go to the arcade, I go and play PAC-MAN.\u201d\n\nHe said at the exhibition, they see a lot of children coming in and playing in the arcade cabinets \u2014 getting just as excited about it as the 55-year-olds who come in for a nostalgic experience. Sabolick said one of the really important elements of the PAC-MAN story is how it was one of the first video games that wasn\u2019t about violence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a very early influential game, so it\u2019s not just like any video game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a game that kind of opened up a lot of conversations around gaming, a lot of ideas around gaming and I think some of the elements that the game kind of trail-blazed are still thought about heavily today in contemporary game design.\u201d\n\nSabolick said there\u2019s a whole section of the exhibit that\u2019s focused on merchandise \u2014 with everything from lunch pails and coffee cups to vinyl records, books and temporary tattoos.\n\n\u201cYou see as technology shifts from generation to generation how PAC-MAN has constantly reinvented itself outside of the video game itself,\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s more than 50 original artworks that make up about half of the exhibit, with a range of aesthetics, from minimalist to animated and digital representations.\n\n\u201cWe call that area of the show the tribute wall,\u201d Sabolick said. \u201cThese are professional working artists that are paying tribute to PAC-MAN\u2019s influence and I think that\u2019s a really important element of the show, because the story of how the creator of PAC-MAN created PAC-MAN and came up with the concept is something that\u2019s super inspiring, but it\u2019s very simple as well.\u201d\n\nThe PAC-MAN character shape was inspired by what a pizza with a slice missing looks like. Tran said Toru Iwatani set out to create a game that appealed to new audiences \u2014 something that was different from other games in the market.",
