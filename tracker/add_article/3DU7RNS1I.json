      "summary": "Nintendo’s Switch 2 sold 2 million units in the U.S. between its June launch and the end of July, driving a 21% jump in overall hardware spending to $384 million—the strongest July for the industry since 2008. All other consoles fell sharply, with the PS5 down 47%, the original Switch 52% and Xbox Series 69%, making the Switch 2 the best‑selling console and the PS5 second. The Switch 2’s record‑breaking launch of 3.5 million units in four days has pushed global sales past 6 million. In July, Donkey Kong Bananza topped physical sales, while Mario Kart World likely leads digital, and overall game spending rose slightly even as accessory spending fell 8%. The year‑to‑date top games are Monster Hunter Wilds, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and College Football 26.",
