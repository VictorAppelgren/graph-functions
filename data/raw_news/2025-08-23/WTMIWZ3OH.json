My little girl forever. How proud I am to be your mummy. I love you more than you could ever imagine or I could ever articulate.\u201d\nThe touching post saw Athena\u2019s famous aunts, Lady Eliza and Lady Amelia, rush to the comments section at the time.\n\u201cHappy 2nd Birthday to my sweetest little love,\u201d they wrote. \u201cYou are my whole heart, and I love and cherish you more than you will ever know. Thank you for giving us the greatest gift @kitty.spencer.\u201d"

      "text": "\u2018Emily in Paris\u2019 assistant director collapses, dies during filming of hit Netflix show\nDiego Borella, an assistant director on the Netflix show \u201cEmily in Paris,\u201d has died.\nThe series was shooting in Venice at the Hotel Danieli when Borella, 47, reportedly collapsed in front of the crew.\nPer La Repubblica, medics were unable to save him after showing up around 7 p.m. on Thursday. The outlet states Borella reportedly suffered a heart attack.\nAt the time, the show was shooting the final scene of Season 5.\nProduction on the last episode has allegedly been stopped. Originally, the shoot was set to wrap on Monday, Aug. 25.\nBorella was reportedly on schedule to shoot the final scene before he collapsed.\nThe Post has reached out to Netflix for comment.\nThe Venice health service said, per The Independent, \u201cOur ambulance arrived at 6:42 p.m. Medics made attempts to resuscitate him. But in the end all efforts proved fruitless. At around 7:30 p.m., he was pronounced deceased.\u201d\nBorella was born in Italy and worked in Rome, London and New York throughout his career.\nDays before Borella\u2019s death, Lily Collins, who stars as Emily Cooper, shared some behind-the-scenes shots from filming.\n\u201cJoy ride to and from work with the best\u2026,\u201d she captioned the pictures that included an image of her co-star Ashley Park.\nAll 10 episodes of Season 5 are set to debut on Netflix on December 18.\nThe fan-favorite series, created by Darren Star, follows Emily, an American marketing executive navigating her life in Paris.\nHowever, new episodes will see the fashionista relocate from the French capital to Italy. The fifth season will be set in Rome and Venice.\nThe series first ventured into Rome during Season 4.\n\u201cIt was so great to go from Paris to Rome because you\u2019re still in Europe and you\u2019re still feeling that romance and passion of Europe, but you\u2019re getting to experience a different part of history which was really fun,\u201d Collins, 36, told The Hollywood Reporter at last year\u2019s premiere.\nNetflix, meanwhile, shared a synopsis for the upcoming season earlier this week.\n\u201cNow the head of Agence Grateau Rome, Emily faces professional and romantic challenges as she adapts to life in a new city. But just as everything falls into place, a work idea backfires, and the fallout cascades into heartbreak and career setbacks.\u201d\n\u201cSeeking stability, Emily leans into her French lifestyle, until a big secret threatens one of her closest relationships. Tackling conflict with honesty, Emily emerges with deeper connections, renewed clarity, and a readiness to embrace new possibilities,\u201d the statement revealed.\nThe Netflix show also stars Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, Lucas Bravo, Samuel Arnold, Bruno Gouery, William Abadie, Lucien Laviscount, Minnie Driver, Eugenio Franceschini, Thalia Besson, Arnaud Binard, Paul Forman, Bryan Greenberg and Mich\u00e8le Laroque.\nIn October, Bravo, 37, hinted at being done with \u201cEmily in Paris.\u201d\nAccording to the Times, the actor said in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro, that he was feeling finished with the show because \u201cLife is short. It takes five months to shoot this series. Do I want to sacrifice them by telling something that does not stimulate me?\u201d\nBravo added, \u201cI do not want to be a part of a cog that does not tend to take the intelligence of viewers into consideration.\u201d\nHowever, the star did decide to reprise his role.\nBravo also told The Hollywood Reporter that he was hoping his character, Gabriel, would see some growth in season five.\n\u201cHe made a few choices that made me kind of grow away from him,\u201d admitted Bravo. \u201cWe were very much alike in season one, but now, I don\u2019t really know. I think I feel like he needs to get his shit together.\u201d\nBut the \u201cTicket to Paradise\u201d alum isn\u2019t the first person to criticize the storylines on the show.\nIn 2021, Brooklyn sports writer Greg Wyshynski told The Post, \u201cRemember that scene in \u2018Goodfellas\u2019 where they slice the garlic with the razor so it just melts away in the pasta sauce? That\u2019s how thin the characters, plots and stakes are for this television program.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cNo one learns. No one grows. Emily is less protagonist than a passenger in the back of a Parisian taxi \u2026 But it\u2019s a good hate watch because it\u2019s not aggressively bad or infuriating. It\u2019s just pretty and it\u2019s there.\u201d\nJenny Marston, a London blogger, also told The Post, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely quite problematic in parts, hugely stereotyped and highly unrealistic. Particularly in the way that Emily\u2019s Internet fame took off almost literally overnight! All of these things are enough to make you inwardly cringe but because it was such a quirky, fun and light-hearted watch, that\u2019s what kept people tuning in.\u201d"

      "text": "\u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 actor Norman Reedus\u2019 son, Mingus, arrested for assault in NYC\nActor Norman Reedus\u2019 son, Mingus Lucien Reedus, was arrested for assault in Manhattan Saturday morning, police sources told The Post.\nThe 25-year-old sometimes-model spawn of former Victoria\u2019s Secret Angel Helena Christensen and \u201cWalking Dead\u201d actor allegedly punched his 33-year-old female victim \u2013 who later identified herself as his girlfriend to The Post \u2013 in the leg, causing redness, and then choked her and slammed her to the ground, police sources said.\nReedus, who is listed in public records as living in a swanky Chelsea apartment, was charged with criminal obstruction of breathing and assault in the third degree, another cop source said.\nThe sources said Reedus called 911 around 8:40 a.m. about a woman taking pills and threatening suicide at the West 16th Street apartment. When cops arrived, the woman said Reedus had assaulted her, according to sources, who said she was then taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition.\nThe woman who identified herself as Reedus\u2019 girlfriend walked out of the 10th NYPD Precinct alongside an unidentified man at around 11:45 p.m.\n\u201cYou got your story all wrong,\u201d the man said to a Post reporter who asked a question.\n\u201cIt was a misunderstanding,\u201d added the thin, short woman, who was wearing big sunglasses and a leather jacket as the pair walked down West 20th Street.\nWhen asked why she called the police, the woman fired back: \u201cHe called the police.\u201d\nHer potty-mouthed companion repeatedly told the reporter to \u201cf\u2013k off\u201d until the pair hopped in a cab on Eighth Avenue.\nA disheveled Reedus with heavy eyelids was photographed being led out of the building by cops around 9:25 a.m.\nReedus, clad in green shorts, a black t-shirt and handcuffs, called a Post reporter and a photographer \u201cugly\u201d as cops escorted him out of the 10th Precinct Saturday afternoon, and reiterated his apparent girlfriend\u2019s claims that the incident was \u201ca misunderstanding\u201d in response to questions.\n\u201cWhy did you call the police?\u201d a reporter called out, to which Reedus responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\nWhen the reporter asked him to \u201ctell us what really happened,\u201d the accused assaulter could be seen grinning and chuckling, before replying \u201cno.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the first time the nepobaby has been accused of assault.\nIn March 2022, Reedus copped a plea deal for allegedly punching a woman during the San Gennaro Festival in Little Italy in the fall of 2021.\nThe victim in that case, a 24-year-old woman, was taken to the hospital with a cut under her left eye after she said Reedus struck her in the face during an argument. The two didn\u2019t know each other, it was reported at the time.\nThe ugly incident occurred just a week after Reedus made his debut on the cover of Vogue Hommes.\nHe pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, though his indignant lawyer thought he should\u2019ve had to take \u201cless responsibility\u201d in the assault case.\nAn assistant district attorney, however, said the victim wished Reedus would \u201ctake more accountability\u201d than the plea bargain offered.\nReedus, who was 22 at the time, was sentenced with a cushiony conditional discharge, which only required him to stay out of trouble for a year and participate in at least five counseling sessions.\nThe troubled child of privilege, who reportedly began modeling in 2017 and signed with The Society Management, apparently shifted his interests to making music this summer. He has put out five songs on Spotify since May, with the latest two being released on Aug."
