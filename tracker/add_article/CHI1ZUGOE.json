      "summary": "EV sales in New Mexico fell from 5.53% to 4.98% in Q1 2025, a decline that coincided with Congress revoking California’s waiver that allowed states to impose stricter EV mandates. New Mexico’s 43% EV target for 2026 appears unattainable, and the state’s government has criticized the federal action as harmful to consumers. Despite the rollback, federal and state subsidies for EV purchases and charging infrastructure remain in place until 2025‑2026, while the Trump administration’s low‑oil‑price stance may further dampen EV demand.",
