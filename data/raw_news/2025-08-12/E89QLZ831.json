  "title": "Trump's takeover of Washington law enforcement begins as National Guard troops arrive",
  "description": "President Trump has activated 800 National Guard members to address what he calls a crime emergency in Washington, D",
  "content": "\u201cHow we got here or what we think about the circumstances \u2014 right now we have more police, and we want to make sure we use them,\u201d she told reporters.\n\nThe tone was a shift from the day before, when Bowser said Trump's plan to take over the Metropolitan Police Department and call in the National Guard was not a productive step and argued his perceived state of emergency simply doesn\u2019t match the declining crime numbers. Still, the law gives the federal government more sway over the capital city than in U.S. states, and Bowser said her administration's ability to push back is limited.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi posted on social media that the meeting was productive.\n\nThe law allows Trump to take over the D.C. police for up to 30 days, though White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested it could last longer as they \u201creevaluate and reassess\" following the monthlong period. Extending federal control past that time would require Congressional approval, something likely tough to achieve in the face of Democratic resistance.\n\nAbout 850 federal law enforcement officers were deployed in Washington on Monday and arrested 23 people overnight, Leavitt said. The charges, she said, included gun and drug crimes, drunk driving, subway fare evasion and homicide.\n\nThe U.S. Park Police has also removed 70 homeless encampments. People who were living in them can leave, go to a homeless shelter or go into drug addiction treatment, Leavitt said. Those who refuse could face fines or jail time.\n\nThe city and Trump have had a bumpy relationship\n\nWhile Trump invokes his plan by saying that \u201cwe're going to take our capital back,\u201d Bowser and the MPD maintain that violent crime overall in Washington has decreased to a 30-year low after a sharp rise in 2023. Carjackings, for example, dropped about 50% in 2024 and are down again this year. More than half of those arrested, however, are juveniles, and the extent of those punishments is a point of contention for the Trump administration.\n\nBowser, a Democrat, spent much of Trump's first term in office openly sparring with the Republican president. She fended off his initial plans for a military parade through the streets and stood in public opposition when he called in a multi-agency flood of federal law enforcement to confront anti-police brutality protesters in summer 2020. She later had the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d painted in giant yellow letters on the street about a block from the White House.\n\nIn Trump's second term, backed by Republican control of both houses of Congress, Bowser has walked a public tightrope for months, emphasizing common ground with the Trump administration on issues such as the successful effort to bring the NFL's Washington Commanders back to the District of Columbia.\n\nShe watched with open concern for the city streets as Trump finally got his military parade this summer. Her decision to dismantle Black Lives Matter Plaza earlier this year served as a neat metaphor for just how much the power dynamics between the two executives had evolved.\n\nNow that fraught relationship enters uncharted territory as Trump has followed through on months of what many D.C. officials had quietly hoped were empty threats. The new standoff has cast Bowser in a sympathetic light, even among her longtime critics.\n\n\u201cIt's a power play and we're an easy target,\u201d said Clinique Chapman, CEO of the D.C. Justice Lab. A frequent critic of Bowser, whom she accuses of \u201cover policing our youth\u201d with the recent expansions of Washington's youth curfew, Chapman said Trump's latest move \u201cis not about creating a safer D.C. It's just about power.\u201d\n\nWhere the power actually lies\n\nBowser contends that all the power resides with Trump and that local officials can do little other than comply and make the best of it. As long as Washington remains a federal enclave with limited autonomy under the 1973 Home Rule Act, she said, it will remain vulnerable to such takeovers.\n\nTrump is the first president to use the law's Section 740 to take over Washington\u2019s police for up to 30 days during times of emergencies.\n\nFor Trump, the effort to take over public safety in D.C. reflects an escalation of his aggressive approach to law enforcement. The District of Columbia\u2019s status as a congressionally established federal district gives him a unique opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime.\n\nTrump's declaration of a state of emergency fits the general pattern of his second term in office. He has declared states of emergency on issues ranging from border protection to economic tariffs, enabling him to essentially rule via executive order. In many cases, he has moved forward while the courts sorted them out.\n\nBowser's claims about successfully driving down violent crime rates received backing earlier this year from an unlikely source. Ed Martin, Trump's original choice for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, issued a press release in April hailing a 25% drop in violent crime rates from the previous year.\n\nIn May, Trump abandoned his efforts to get Martin confirmed for the post in the face of opposition in Congress. His replacement candidate, former judge and former Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, was recently confirmed. On Monday, Pirro \u2014 standing next to Trump \u2014 called his takeover \u201cthe step that we need right now to make criminals understand that they are not going to get away with it anymore.\"",

      "text": "Trump pulls the nomination of Ed Martin for DC US Attorney after concerns of partisanship\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Thursday that he would pull his nomination of Ed Martin Jr. to be the top federal prosecutor for the nation\u2019s capital, bowing to bipartisan concerns about the conservative activist\u2019s modest legal experience, divisive politics and support for Jan. 6 rioters.\nInstead, the president said Martin will be tapped as an associate deputy attorney general and pardon attorney, putting him in the position of recommending pardons for a slew of defendants involved in the violent insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. When he returned to office in January, Trump granted sweeping pardons and commutations of all people charged with crimes in connection with the riot, or vowed to dismiss their cases.\nIn his new role, Martin will also be director of the \u201cweaponization working group\u201d at the Justice Department. That group was created in February to investigate the work of former special counsel Jack Smith, who led two federal prosecutions of Trump that were ultimately dismissed, and other instances during the administration of former President Joe Biden that Republicans say unfairly targeted conservatives.\n\u201cIn these highly important roles, Ed will make sure we finally investigate the Weaponization of our Government under the Biden Regime, and provide much needed Justice for its victims,\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post Thursday evening.\nOn the social media platform X, Martin posted, \u201cEagle Unleashed.\u201d\nTrump abandoned his pick to lead the nation\u2019s largest U.S. Attorney\u2019s office two days after a key Republican senator said he could not support Martin for the job due to his defense of rioters who stormed the Capitol more than four years ago. Later Thursday, Trump announced that Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, a former county prosecutor and elected judge, will be the interim top federal prosecutor for Washington, D.C.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a terrific person, and he wasn\u2019t getting the support from people that I thought,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the status of Martin\u2019s confirmation. He signaled he had little capacity to call on-the-fence senators to lobby them: \u201cI can only lift that little phone so many times in a day.\u201d\nWithin minutes of Trump\u2019s announcement, Martin jokingly posted a doctored image of himself on social media dressed in papal garments with the words, \u201cPlot twist\u201d \u2014 alluding to the breaking news that a new pope has been elected to lead the Catholic Church.\nMartin has served as acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia since Trump\u2019s first week in office. But his hopes of keeping the job faded amid questions about his qualifications and background, including his support for Jan. 6 rioters.\nMartin has stirred up a chorus of critics during his brief but tumultuous tenure in office. He fired and demoted subordinates who worked on politically sensitive cases. He posted on social media about potential targets of investigations. And he forced the chief of the office\u2019s criminal division to resign after directing her to scrutinize the awarding of a government contract during Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.\nMartin\u2019s temporary appointment is due to expire on May 20.\nNorth Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said Tuesday that he wouldn\u2019t support Martin\u2019s nomination. Tillis, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said his opposition stemmed from Martin\u2019s defense of rioters who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Other Republicans seemed likely to oppose Martin\u2019s nomination as well.\nIn response to a committee questionnaire, Martin initially failed to disclose that he made over 150 appearances on the Russian government-funded RT and Sputnik networks before he took office. He later included them in a follow-up letter.\nDozens of former prosecutors from the office publicly opposed Martin\u2019s nomination. In a letter to the committee, more than 100 office veterans described him as \u201can affront to the singular pursuit of justice for which this Office has stood for more than two centuries.\u201d\nMartin also had some prominent supporters, including Elon Musk, Charlie Kirk and Donald Trump Jr. His backers touted his record of fighting for conservative causes and his efforts to reduce violent crime in Washington.\nMartin was a leading figure in Trump\u2019s \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement. He spoke at a rally in Washington on the eve of the Capitol riot. He represented three Jan. 6 defendants and served on the board of the nonprofit Patriot Freedom Project, which reports raising over $2.5 million to support riot defendants.\nIn office, Martin oversaw the dismissals of hundreds of Jan. 6 cases after Trump pardoned defendants, commuted sentences or vowed to throw them out. Martin also ordered an internal review of prosecutors\u2019 use of a felony charge against hundreds of Capitol rioters, directing employees to hand over files, emails and other documents.\nMartin\u2019s opponents also homed in on his public praise for a Capitol riot defendant, Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, who openly espoused white supremacist and antisemitic ideology and photographed himself sporting a Hitler mustache. He referred to Hale-Cusanelli as a friend who is \u201can extraordinary guy.\u201d\nMartin told committee members that he condemns Hale-Cusanelli\u2019s hateful comments as \u201cabhorrent and deplorable.\u201d He claimed he didn\u2019t learn about them until after he presented him with the award during an event at Trump\u2019s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\nMartin practiced law in Missouri but never worked as a prosecutor or tried a case before Trump appointed him in January. Martin chaired the Missouri Republican Party before becoming president of conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagle Forum in April 2013. He co-authored a book about Trump with Schlafly, who died in 2016.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Zeke Miller contributed reporting."

      "text": "Republicans, Democrats alike exhort Trump: Keep security pact with Australia and UK alive\nRepublicans, Democrats alike exhort Trump: Keep security pact with Australia and UK alive\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. lawmakers from both parties are urging the Trump administration to maintain a three-way security partnership designed to supply Australia with nuclear-powered submarines \u2014 a plea that comes as the Pentagon reviews the agreement and considers the questions it has raised about the American industrial infrastructure\u2019s shipbuilding capabilities.\nTwo weeks ago, the Defense Department announced it would review AUKUS, the 4-year-old pact signed by the Biden administration with Australia and the United Kingdom. The announcement means the Republican administration is looking closely at a partnership that many believe is critical to the U.S. strategy to push back China\u2019s influence in the Indo-Pacific. The review is expected to be completed in the fall.\n\u201cAUKUS is essential to strengthening deterrence in the Indo-Pacific and advancing the undersea capabilities that will be central to ensuring peace and stability,\u201d Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan and Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois wrote in a July 22 letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Moolenaar chairs the House panel on China and Krishnamoorthi is its top Democrat.\nThe review comes as the Trump administration works to rebalance its global security concerns while struggling with a hollowed-out industrial base that has hamstrung U.S. capabilities to build enough warships. The review is being led by Elbridge Colby, the No. 3 Pentagon official, who has expressed skepticism about the partnership.\n\u201cIf we can produce the attack submarines in sufficient number and sufficient speed, then great. But if we can\u2019t, that becomes a very difficult problem,\u201d Colby said during his confirmation hearing in March. \u201cThis is getting back to restoring our defense industrial capacity so that we don\u2019t have to face these awful choices but rather can be in a position where we can produce not only for ourselves, but for our allies.\u201d\nUS cannot build enough ships\nAs part of the $269 billion AUKUS partnership, the United States will sell three to five Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, with the first delivery scheduled as soon as 2032. The U.S. and the U.K. would help Australia design and build another three to five attack submarines to form an eight-boat force for Australia.\nA March report by the Congressional Research Service warned that the lack of U.S. shipbuilding capacities, including workforce shortage and insufficient supply chains, is jeopardizing the much-celebrated partnership. If the U.S. should sell the vessels to Australia, the U.S. Navy would have a shortage of attack submarines for two decades, the report said.\nThe Navy has been ordering two boats per year in the last decade, but U.S. shipyards have been only producing 1.2 Virginia-class subs a year since 2022, the report said.\n\u201cThe delivery pace is not where it needs to be\u201d to make good on the first pillar of AUKUS, Admiral Daryl Caudle, nominee for the Chief of Naval Operations, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last month.\nAustralia has invested $1 billion in the U.S. submarine industrial base, with another $1 billion to be paid before the end of this year. It has agreed to contribute a total of $3 billion to uplift the U.S. submarine base, and it has sent both industry personnel to train at U.S. shipyards and naval personnel for submarine training in the United States.\n\u201cAustralia was clear that we would make a proportionate contribution to the United States industrial base,\u201d an Australian defense spokesperson said in July. \u201cAustralia\u2019s contribution is about accelerating U.S. production rates and maintenance to enable the delivery of Australia\u2019s future Virginia-class submarines.\u201d\nThe three nations have also jointly tested communication capabilities with underwater autonomous systems, Australia\u2019s defense ministry said on July 23. Per the partnership, the countries will co-develop other advanced technologies, from undersea to hypersonic capabilities.\nAt the recent Aspen Security Forum, Kevin Rudd, the Australian ambassador to the United States, said his country is committed to increasing defense spending to support its first nuclear-powered sub program, which would also provide \u201cmassively expensive full maintenance repair facilities\u201d for the U.S. Indo-Pacific fleet based in Western Australia.\nRudd expressed confidence that the two governments \u201cwill work our way through this stuff.\u201d\nAUKUS called \u2018crucial to American deterrence\u2019\nBruce Jones, senior fellow with the Strobe Talbott Center for Security, Strategy and Technology, told The Associated Press that the partnership, by positioning subs in Western Australia, is helping arm the undersea space that is \u201creally crucial to American deterrence and defense options in the Western Pacific.\u201d\n\u201cThe right answer is not to be content with the current pace of submarine building. It\u2019s to increase the pace,\u201d Jones said.\nJennifer Parker, who has served more than 20 years with the Royal Australian Navy and founded Barrier Strategic Advisory, said it should not be a zero-sum game. \u201cYou might sell one submarine to Australia, so you have one less submarine on paper. But in terms of the access, you have the theater of choice from operating from Australia, from being able to maintain your submarines from Australia,\u201d Parker said. \u201cThis is not a deal that just benefits Australia.\u201d\nDefense policy is one of the few areas where Republican lawmakers have pushed back against the Trump administration, but their resolve is being tested with the Pentagon\u2019s review of AUKUS. So far, they have joined their Democratic colleagues in voicing support for the partnership.\nThey said the U.S. submarine industry is rebounding with congressional appropriations totaling $10 billion since 2018 to ensure the U.S. will have enough ships to allow for sales to Australia.\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told the AP that support for AUKUS is strong and bipartisan, \u201ccertainly on the Armed Services Committee.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a little bit of mystification about the analysis done at the Pentagon,\u201d Kaine said, adding that \u201cmaybe (what) the analysis will say is: We believe this is a good thing.\u201d"

      "text": "Trump, Congress and city council: Managing relationships, DC\u2019s mayor walks a tightrope\nTrump, Congress and city council: Managing relationships, DC\u2019s mayor walks a tightrope\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser drew a laugh from the room when she was asked how it feels to manage a mercurial relationship with the White House and Congress \u2014 while, by the way, also trying to run a city of 700,000 people.\n\u201cIt is just like you might imagine,\u201d she deadpanned. \u201cIt\u2019s tricky.\u201d\nA few hours after that comment Monday, Bowser\u2019s balancing act with President Donald Trump was on public display. She appeared with Trump to celebrate Washington being named as host for the 2027 NFL draft and maintained a poker face while Trump talked at length about immigration.\nBowser also continues to lobby the House of Representatives to pass a simple fix that would prevent the nation\u2019s capital from having to immediately cut $400 million from its 2025 budget in the middle of the budget year. The House essentially created the shortfall earlier this year when it eliminated a little-known provision in a budget resolution. The change would force the District of Columbia to immediately revert to its 2024 budget parameters.\nAnd while the Senate immediately passed a simple fix, the House has failed to bring that measure up for a vote during four weeks in session \u2014 despite it being publicly endorsed by Trump. Bowser has warned that layoffs, furloughs and service cuts could be coming \u2014 and within days \u2014 if the issue isn\u2019t resolved.\nShowdown looms between DC mayor and council\nNow Bowser\u2019s relationship with the D.C. Council is coming under public stress. The third-term mayor faces a looming showdown with the council over a host of budget issues and her new deal to bring the NFL\u2019s Washington Commanders back to the nation\u2019s capital.\nCiting the uncertainty surrounding the 2025 budget, Bowser has delayed submitting a proposed 2026 budget to the council by more than a month. But D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson has publicly complained that Bowser is dragging out the process.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait longer to start making the service reductions and cuts,\u201d Mendelson said Monday of the 2025 budget cuts. \u201cShe has to move forward now.\u201d\nBowser maintains she is following the proper timeline and protocol required by the city\u2019s chief financial officer. But Mendelson contends that Bowser was using the delay to \u201cjam the council\u201d and force it into a pressurized deadline where city legislators wouldn\u2019t have time to properly question either the budget or the particulars of the Commanders agreement.\nDebate expected on stadium deal\nThat stadium deal should prompt a robust debate when it comes up for D.C. Council approval. When it was first announced, Mendelson said he didn\u2019t think it had enough votes to pass. But different members of the 12-person body have staked out widely varied initial positions.\nFirst-term Ward 5 Councilmember Zachary Parker called the chance to bring football back to the nation\u2019s capital and revitalize the site of the old RFK Stadium \u201ca once in a generation opportunity.\u201d\nParker said he believed the deal would and should pass; he simply wants to make sure the city gets the best deal possible.\nBut veteran Ward 6 Councilmember Charles Allen has taken a harder public line. He says he opposes the entire concept of a stadium \u2014 especially if any significant amount of public money is spent on the project.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a stadium returns back the economic investment. Every study under the sun shows that,\u201d Allen said last week at a public meeting to rally opposition to the stadium deal. \u201cYou can love football and love the Commanders and still think this is a bad deal for the city.\u201d"

The District of Columbia\u2019s status as a congressionally established federal district gives him a unique opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime.\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on reaction to President Trump\u2019s DC police takeover plan.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi will assume responsibility for Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department, Trump said, as he also railed against potholes and graffiti in the city and called them \u201cembarrassing.\u201d The president did not provide a timeline for the control of the police department, but he\u2019s limited to 30 days under statute unless he gets approval from Congress.\nAs Trump spoke, demonstrators gathered outside the White House to protest his moves. And local officials rejected the Republican president\u2019s depiction of the district as crime-ridden and called his actions illegal.\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s actions are unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful,\u201d District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said. \u201cThere is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia.\u201d\nSchwalb, a Democrat, said violent crime in the district reached historic 30-year lows last year and is down an additional 26% this year.\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser said she would follow the law regarding the \u201cso-called emergency\u201d even as she indicated that Trump\u2019s actions were a reason why the District of Columbia should be a state with legal protections from such actions.\n\u201cWhile this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can\u2019t say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we\u2019re totally surprised,\u201d Bowser said.\nCombating crime\nThe president dismissed the idea Washington needed to enlarge its 3,500-officer police force, even as he seeks to have more armed personnel going through the city with the goal of reducing crime.\n\u201cWhat you need is rules and regulations, and you need the right people to implement them,\u201d he said.\nTrump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act in an executive order to declare a \u201ccrime emergency\u201d so his administration could take over the city\u2019s police force. He signed a directive for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to activate the National Guard.\nWhile Trump has portrayed himself as a friend to law enforcement and enjoyed the political backing from many of their groups, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of the 1,500-plus people charged with crimes in the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, including people convicted of assaulting police officers.\nAbout 500 federal law enforcement officers are being tasked with deploying throughout the nation\u2019s capital as part of Trump\u2019s effort to combat crime, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.\nMore than 100 FBI agents and about 40 agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are among federal personnel being assigned to patrols in Washington, the person briefed on the plans said. The Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Marshals Service are contributing officers.\nThe person was not authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity. The Justice Department didn\u2019t immediately have a comment Monday morning.\nThe National Guard\nBowser, a Democrat, has previously questioned the effectiveness of using the National Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. Superior Court, some of which have been open for years.\nBowser cannot activate the National Guard herself, but she can submit a request to the Pentagon.\n\u201cI just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our Guard,\u201d she said Sunday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d acknowledging it is \u201cthe president\u2019s call about how to deploy the Guard.\u201d\nBowser noted that violent crime in Washington has decreased since a rise in 2023. She stressed during a Monday news conference that she believed Trump\u2019s views of the city were shaped by the \u201cchallenging times\u201d of the coronavirus pandemic, when he faced protests and crime spiked as the country began to recover from the outbreak.\nFocusing on homelessness\nTrump has emphasized the removal of Washington\u2019s homeless population, though it was unclear where the thousands of people would go, and he did not give details at his news conference Monday.\n\u201cThe Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\u201d Trump wrote Sunday in a social media post. \u201cWe will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don\u2019t have to move out. We\u2019re going to put you in jail where you belong.\u201d\nJesse Rabinowitz, a advocate for homeless people, called Trump\u2019s plan \u201cfascist\u201d and a \u201cwaste\u201d of resources. He said the move wasn\u2019t about safety.\n\u201cIt is about power, and it is about fascism and authoritarianism,\u201d said Rabinowitz, the campaign and communication director for the National Homelessness Law Center. \u201cIf Donald Trump wanted to keep D.C. safe, he would fund housing and support. Instead, the Republicans just gutted health care, and they\u2019re passing through a budget that will make homelessness worse. They do not care about helping people.\u201d\nCrime statistics\nPolice statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. Overall, violent crime is down 26% compared with this time a year ago.\nThe president has criticized the district as full of \u201ctents, squalor, filth, and Crime,\u201d and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as the Department of Government Efficiency. Police arrested two 15-year-olds in the attempted carjacking and said they were looking for others.\n\u201cThis has to be the best run place in the country, not the worst run place in the country,\u201d Trump said Wednesday.\nHe called Bowser \u201ca good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.\u201d\nTrump has repeatedly suggested the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities. Doing so would require a repeal of the Home Rule Act of 1973 in Congress, a step Trump said lawyers are examining.\nBowser acknowledged the law allows the president to take more control over the city\u2019s police, but only if certain conditions are met.\n\u201cNone of those conditions exist in our city right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not experiencing a spike in crime. In fact, we\u2019re watching our crime numbers go down.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writers Ashraf Khalil, Alanna Durkin Richer, Nathan Ellgren, Darlene Superville and Michelle L.

      "text": "Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Declares National Emergency to Increase our Competitive Edge, Protect our Sovereignty, and Strengthen our National and Economic Security\nPURSUING RECIPROCITY TO REBUILD THE ECONOMY AND RESTORE NATIONAL AND ECONOMIC SECURITY: Today, President Donald J. Trump declared that foreign trade and economic practices have created a national emergency, and his order imposes responsive tariffs to strengthen the international economic position of the United States and protect American workers.\n- Large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits have led to the hollowing out of our manufacturing base; resulted in a lack of incentive to increase advanced domestic manufacturing capacity; undermined critical supply chains; and rendered our defense-industrial base dependent on foreign adversaries.\n- President Trump is invoking his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to address the national emergency posed by the large and persistent trade deficit that is driven by the absence of reciprocity in our trade relationships and other harmful policies like currency manipulation and exorbitant value-added taxes (VAT) perpetuated by other countries.\n- Using his IEEPA authority, President Trump will impose a 10% tariff on all countries.\n- This will take effect April 5, 2025 at 12:01 a.m. EDT.\n- President Trump will impose an individualized reciprocal higher tariff on the countries with which the United States has the largest trade deficits. All other countries will continue to be subject to the original 10% tariff baseline.\n- This will take effect April 9, 2025 at 12:01 a.m. EDT.\n- These tariffs will remain in effect until such a time as President Trump determines that the threat posed by the trade deficit and underlying nonreciprocal treatment is satisfied, resolved, or mitigated.\n- Today\u2019s IEEPA Order also contains modification authority, allowing President Trump to increase the tariff if trading partners retaliate or decrease the tariffs if trading partners take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align with the United States on economic and national security matters.\n- Some goods will not be subject to the Reciprocal Tariff. These include: (1) articles subject to 50 USC 1702(b); (2) steel/aluminum articles and autos/auto parts already subject to Section 232 tariffs; (3) copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber articles; (4) all articles that may become subject to future Section 232 tariffs; (5) bullion; and (6) energy and other certain minerals that are not available in the United States.\n- For Canada and Mexico, the existing fentanyl/migration IEEPA orders remain in effect, and are unaffected by this order. This means USMCA compliant goods will continue to see a 0% tariff, non-USMCA compliant goods will see a 25% tariff, and non-USMCA compliant energy and potash will see a 10% tariff. In the event the existing fentanyl/migration IEEPA orders are terminated, USMCA compliant goods would continue to receive preferential treatment, while non-USMCA compliant goods would be subject to a 12% reciprocal tariff.\nTAKING BACK OUR ECONOMIC SOVEREIGNTY: President Trump refuses to let the United States be taken advantage of and believes that tariffs are necessary to ensure fair trade, protect American workers, and reduce the trade deficit\u2014this is an emergency.\n- He is the first President in modern history to stand strong for hardworking Americans by asking other countries to follow the golden rule on trade: Treat us like we treat you.\n- Pernicious economic policies and practices of our trading partners undermine our ability to produce essential goods for the public and the military, threatening national security.\n- U.S. companies, according to internal estimates, pay over $200 billion per year in value-added taxes (VAT) to foreign governments\u2014a \u201cdouble-whammy\u201d on U.S. companies who pay the tax at the European border, while European companies don\u2019t pay tax to the United States on the income from their exports to the U.S.\n- The annual cost to the U.S. economy of counterfeit goods, pirated software, and theft of trade secrets is between $225 billion and $600 billion. Counterfeit products not only pose a significant risk to U.S. competitiveness, but also threaten the security, health, and safety of Americans, with the global trade in counterfeit pharmaceuticals estimated at $4.4 billion and linked to the distribution of deadly fentanyl-laced drugs.\n- This imbalance has fueled a large and persistent trade deficit in both industrial and agricultural goods, led to offshoring of our manufacturing base, empowered non-market economies like China, and hurt America\u2019s middle class and small towns.\n- President Biden squandered the agricultural trade surplus inherited from President Trump\u2019s first term, turning it into a projected all-time high deficit of $49 billion.\n- The current global trading order allows those using unfair trade practices to get ahead, while those playing by the rules get left behind.\n- In 2024, our trade deficit in goods exceeded $1.2 trillion\u2014an unsustainable crisis ignored by prior leadership.\n- \u201cMade in America\u201d is not just a tagline\u2014it\u2019s an economic and national security priority of this Administration. The President\u2019s reciprocal trade agenda means better-paying American jobs making beautiful American-made cars, appliances, and other goods.\n- These tariffs seek to address the injustices of global trade, re-shore manufacturing, and drive economic growth for the American people.\n- Reciprocal trade is America First trade because it increases our competitive edge, protects our sovereignty, and strengthens our national and economic security.\n- These tariffs adjust for the unfairness of ongoing international trade practices, balance our chronic goods trade deficit, provide an incentive for re-shoring production to the United States, and provide our foreign trading partners with an opportunity to rebalance their trade relationships with the United States.\nREPRIORITIZING U.S. MANUFACTURING: President Trump recognizes that increasing domestic manufacturing is critical to U.S. national security.\n- In 2023, U.S. manufacturing output as a share of global manufacturing output was 17.4%, down from 28.4% in 2001.\n- The decline in manufacturing output has reduced U.S. manufacturing capacity.\n- The need to maintain a resilient domestic manufacturing capacity is particularly acute in advanced sectors like autos, shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, transport equipment, technology products, machine tools, and basic and fabricated metals, where loss of capacity could permanently weaken U.S. competitiveness.\n- U.S. stockpiles of military goods are too low to be compatible with U.S. national defense interests.\n- If the U.S. wishes to maintain an effective security umbrella to defend its citizens and homeland, as well as allies and partners, it needs to have a large upstream manufacturing and goods-producing ecosystem.\n- This includes developing new manufacturing technologies in critical sectors like bio-manufacturing, batteries, and microelectronics to support defense needs.\n- Increased reliance on foreign producers for goods has left the U.S. supply chain vulnerable to geopolitical disruption and supply shocks.\n- This vulnerability was exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and later with Houthi attacks on Middle East shipping.\n- From 1997 to 2024, the U.S. lost around 5 million manufacturing jobs and experienced one of the largest drops in manufacturing employment in history.\nADDRESSING TRADE IMBALANCES: President Trump is working to level the playing field for American businesses and workers by confronting the unfair tariff disparities and non-tariff barriers imposed by other countries.\n- For generations, countries have taken advantage of the United States, tariffing us at higher rates. For example:\n- The United States imposes a 2.5% tariff on passenger vehicle imports (with internal combustion engines), while the European Union (10%) and India (70%) impose much higher duties on the same product.\n- For networking switches and routers, the United States imposes a 0% tariff, but India (10-20%) levies higher rates.\n- Brazil (18%) and Indonesia (30%) impose a higher tariff on ethanol than does the United States (2.5%).\n- For rice in the husk, the U.S. imposes a tariff of 2.7%, while India (80%), Malaysia (40%), and Turkey (31%) impose higher rates.\n- Apples enter the United States duty-free, but not so in Turkey (60.3%) and India (50%).\n- The United States has one of the lowest simple average most-favored-nation (MFN) tariff rates in the world at 3.3%, while many of our key trading partners like Brazil (11.2%), China (7.5%), the European Union (5%), India (17%), and Vietnam (9.4%) have simple average MFN tariff rates that are significantly higher.\n- Similarly, non-tariff barriers\u2014meant to limit the quantity of imports/exports and protect domestic industries\u2014also deprive U.S. manufacturers of reciprocal access to markets around the world. For example:\n- China\u2019s non-market policies and practices have given China global dominance in key manufacturing industries, decimating U.S. industry. Between 2001 and 2018, these practices contributed to the loss of 3.7 million U.S. jobs due to the growth of the U.S.-China trade deficit, displacing workers and undermining American competitiveness while threatening U.S. economic and national security by increasing our reliance on foreign-controlled supply chains for critical industries as well as everyday goods.\n- India imposes their own uniquely burdensome and/or duplicative testing and certification requirements in sectors such as chemicals, telecom products, and medical devices that make it difficult or costly for American companies to sell their products in India. If these barriers were removed, it is estimated that U.S. exports would increase by at least $5.3 billion annually.\n- Countries including China, Germany, Japan, and South Korea have pursued policies that suppress the domestic consumption power of their own citizens to artificially boost the competitiveness of their export products. Such policies include regressive tax systems, low or unenforced penalties for environmental degradation, and policies intended to suppress worker wages relative to productivity.\n- Certain countries, like Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Vietnam, restrict or prohibit the importation of remanufactured goods, restricting market access for U.S. exporters while also stifling efforts to promote sustainability by discouraging trade in like-new and resource-efficient products. If these barriers were removed, it is estimated that U.S. exports would increase by at least $18 billion annually.\n- The UK maintains non-science-based standards that severely restrict U.S. exports of safe, high-quality beef and poultry products.\n- Indonesia maintains local content requirements across a broad range of sectors, complex import licensing regimes, and, starting this year, will require natural resource firms to onshore all export revenue for transactions worth $250,000 or more.\n- Argentina has banned imports of U.S. live cattle since 2002 due to unsubstantiated concerns regarding bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The United States has a $223 million trade deficit with Argentina in beef and beef products.\n- For decades, South Africa has imposed animal health restrictions that are not scientifically justified on U.S. pork products, permitting a very limited list of U.S. pork exports to enter South Africa. South Africa also heavily restricts U.S. poultry exports through high tariffs, anti-dumping duties, and unjustified animal health restrictions. These barriers have contributed to a 78% decline in U.S. poultry exports to South Africa, from $89 million in 2019 to $19 million 2024.\n- U.S. automakers face a variety of non-tariff barriers that impede access to the Japanese and Korean automotive markets, including non-acceptance of certain U.S. standards, duplicative testing and certification requirements, and transparency issues. Due to these non-reciprocal practices, the U.S. automotive industry loses out on an additional $13.5 billion in annual exports to Japan and access to a larger import market share in Korea\u2014all while the U.S. trade deficit with Korea more than tripled from 2019 to 2024.\n- Monetary tariffs and non-monetary tariffs are two distinct types of trade barriers that governments use to regulate imports and exports. President Trump is countering both through reciprocal tariffs to protect American workers and industries from these unfair practices.\nTHE GOLDEN RULE FOR OUR GOLDEN AGE: Today\u2019s action simply asks other countries to treat us like we treat them. It\u2019s the Golden Rule for Our Golden Age.\n- Access to the American market is a privilege, not a right.\n- The United States will no longer put itself last on matters of international trade in exchange for empty promises.\n- Reciprocal tariffs are a big part of why Americans voted for President Trump\u2014it was a cornerstone of his campaign from the start.\n- Everyone knew he\u2019d push for them once he got back in office; it\u2019s exactly what he promised, and it\u2019s a key reason he won the election.\n- These tariffs are central to President Trump\u2019s plan to reverse the economic damage left by President Biden and put America on a path to a new golden age.\n- This builds on his broader economic agenda of energy competitiveness, tax cuts, no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security benefits, and deregulation to boost American prosperity.\nTARIFFS WORK: Studies have repeatedly shown that tariffs can be an effective tool for reducing or eliminating threats that impair U.S. national security and achieving economic and strategic objectives.\n- A 2024 study on the effects of President Trump\u2019s tariffs in his first term found that they \u201cstrengthened the U.S. economy\u201d and \u201cled to significant reshoring\u201d in industries like manufacturing and steel production.\n- A 2023 report by the U.S. International Trade Commission that analyzed the effects of Section 232 and 301 tariffs on more than $300 billion of U.S. imports found that the tariffs reduced imports from China and effectively stimulated more U.S. production of the tariffed goods, with very minor effects on prices.\n- According to the Economic Policy Institute, the tariffs implemented by President Trump during his first term \u201cclearly show[ed] no correlation with inflation\u201d and only had a temporary effect on overall price levels.\n- An analysis from the Atlantic Council found that \u201ctariffs would create new incentives for US consumers to buy US-made products.\u201d\n- Former Biden Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen affirmed last year that tariffs do not raise prices: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that American consumers will see any meaningful increase in the prices that they face.\u201d\n- A 2024 economic analysis found that a global tariff of 10% would grow the economy by $728 billion, create 2.8 million jobs, and increase real household incomes by 5.7%."

The entire District of Columbia is normally a no-fly zone for drones.\nArmy officials have estimated around 200,000 attendees for the evening military parade, and McCool said he was prepared for \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of people.\n\u201cWe have a ton of magnetometers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a million people show up, then we\u2019re going to have some lines.\u201d\nWashington, D.C. is preparing for the June 14 military parade to honor the 250th birthday of the army and the 79th birthday of President Donald Trump. (AP Video: Nathan Ellgren, Rick Gentilo)\nA total of 175 magnetometers would be used at security checkpoints controlling access to the daytime birthday festival and the nighttime parade. Metropolitan Police Department chief Pamela Smith predicted \u201cmajor impacts to traffic\u201d and advised attendees to arrive early and consider forgoing cars for the Metro.\n\u201cThis is a significant event with a large footprint,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re relying on the public to be an extra set of ears and eyes for us.\u201d\nThe military parade has been designated a National Special Security Event \u2014 similar to a presidential inauguration or state funeral. That status is reserved for events that draw large crowds and potential mass protests. It calls for an enhanced degree of high-level coordination among D.C. officials, the FBI, Capitol Police and Washington\u2019s National Guard contingent \u2014 with the Secret Service taking the lead.\nThe Army birthday celebration had already been planned for months. But earlier this spring, Trump announced his intention to transform the event \u2014 which coincides with his 79th birthday \u2014 into a massive military parade complete with 60-ton M1 Abrams battle tanks and Paladin self-propelled howitzers rolling through the city streets.\nMultiple counter-protests of varying sizes are planned for Saturday, with the largest being a mass march to the White House. Officials say they are also on alert for signs that the immigration-related clashes between law enforcement and protesters currently roiling Los Angeles would spread.\n\u201cWe\u2019re paying attention, obviously, to what is happening there. We\u2019ll be ready,\u201d McCool said. \u201cWe have a robust plan for civil disobedience.\u201d\nAgent Phillip Bates of the FBI\u2019s Washington Field office, which is tasked with counterterrorism and crisis management, said there were \u201cno credible threats\u201d to the event at the moment.\nLindsey Appiah, the deputy mayor for public safety, told The Associated Press last week that the city had longstanding plans for the Army birthday celebration. But those plans \u201cgot a lot bigger on short notice\u201d when Trump got involved.\nStill, Appiah said the city has grown \u201cvery flexible, very nimble\u201d at rolling with these sort of changes.\n___\nThis story was first published on June 9, 2025. It was published again on June 10, 2025, to delete an incorrect reference to a march to the White House being dubbed the No Kings rally.

      "text": "What\u2019s known and not yet known about the Justice Department\u2019s scrutiny of Trump-Russia probe origins\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 News that Attorney General Pam Bondi is advancing a criminal investigation into the Obama-era origins of the Trump-Russia investigation means that one of the most studied, and politically polarizing, chapters of modern American history will be under the microscope yet again.\nHere\u2019s a look at what\u2019s known and not yet known about the latest Justice Department revelation:\nA saga with a long backstory\nPerhaps no issue continues to aggravate President Donald Trump more than the assessment by intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on his behalf and the investigation by law enforcement into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow to tip the outcome of the contest.\nRobert Mueller, the former FBI director tapped as special counsel by Trump\u2019s first Justice Department to investigate, found that Russia had waged a multi-prong operation in Trump\u2019s favor and that the Republican president\u2019s campaign welcomed the aid. But Mueller did not find sufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign.\nAs president for a second time, Trump has made no secret of his desire to use the Justice Department as a weapon of retribution against perceived political adversaries he sees as having smeared him, including by calling for Obama-era officials to be jailed.\nAnd his administration, now more broadly and across multiple agencies, has been engaged in a effort to reopen the long-accepted conclusion \u2014 including among prominent Republicans \u2014 of Russian interference and to scrutinize the officials involved in reaching that assessment.\nA Bondi grand jury directive\nBondi, a Trump loyalist, has directed Justice Department prosecutors to investigate the Russia inquiry and has authorized the use of a grand jury. Grand juries are tools used by prosecutors to issue subpoenas for records and testimony and to produce indictments based on the evidence they receive.\nThe bar is low for an indictment given that the presentation of evidence by prosecutors is one-sided, though grand juries do have the option to decline to indict and have done so in the past.\nA person familiar with the matter confirmed Bondi\u2019s directive to The Associated Press but key questions remain.\nThe Justice Department has not disclosed, for instance, which prosecutors are pursuing the investigation, where the grand jury that might hear evidence is located and whether and when law enforcement officials might seek to bring criminal charges.\nThe Justice Department, in an unusual statement last month, appeared to confirm the existence of an investigation into former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director James Brennan but provided no details.\nPotential targets of probe remain unclear\nIt\u2019s not clear who might be targeted in the investigation, but the Trump administration has been aggressively challenging intelligence community conclusions about Russia\u2019s actions and intentions that had seemed settled long ago.\nIt\u2019s been a welcome diversion for the administration as it confronts a wave of criticism from Trump\u2019s base and conservative influencers over the handling of records from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation.\nIn the last month, Trump administration officials and allies have released a series of documents aimed at casting doubt on the extent of interference and at portraying the original Russia investigation as an Obama administration frame-job.\nThe documents have been hailed by Trump and other supporters as incontrovertible proof of a conspiracy, but a close inspection of the records shows they fall well short of that.\nAmong the documents released by Tulsi Gabbard, the administration\u2019s director of national intelligence, are emails showing that Obama administration officials recognized in 2016 that Russians had not hacked state election systems to manipulate votes in favor of Trump.\nBut the absence of evidence that votes were switched \u2014 something the Obama administration never alleged \u2014 has no bearing on the ample evidence of other forms of Russia interference, including a hack-and-leak operation involving Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign aimed at sowing discord and spreading disinformation.\nLast week, Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released a previously classified annex of a 2023 report by John Durham, the special counsel appointed by the first Trump administration to hunt for government misconduct in the Trump-Russia investigation.\nThe annex included a series of emails, including one from July 2016 that was purportedly sent by a senior staffer at a philanthropic organization founded by billionaire investor George Soros, that referred to a plan approved by then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to link Trump to Russia at a time when the public was focusing on her use of a private email server.\nBut Durham\u2019s own report took pain to note that investigators had not corroborated the communications as authentic and that the alleged author had no recollection of drafting the email. The report said the Durham team\u2019s best assessment was that the message was \u201ca composites of several emails\u201d the Russians had obtained from hacking \u2014 raising the likelihood that it was a product of Russian disinformation.\nFresh scrutiny has also centered around the intelligence community assessment on Russian election interference published in January 2017. An annex in a classified version of the assessment contained a summary of the so-called Steele dossier \u2014 a compilation of opposition research that included uncorroborated rumors and salacious gossip about Trump and Russia.\nThe latest in a series of investigations\nJust as Russian interference has been heavily scrutinized, so too has the U.S. government\u2019s response to it.\nMultiple government reports, including not only from Mueller but also a Republican-led Senate intelligence committee that included current Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have documented Russia\u2019s activities in painstaking detail.\nTo be sure, reports from the Justice Department inspector general and Durham also identified significant flaws in the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation, including errors and omissions in applications the Justice Department submitted to a secretive surveillance court to eavesdrop on a national security adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign.\nBut Durham found no criminal wrongdoing among senior government officials, bringing three criminal cases \u2014 two against private citizens that resulted in acquittals at trial and a third against a little-known FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to doctoring an email.\nIt is unclear if there is any criminal misconduct that exists that Durham, who launched his investigation in 2019 and concluded it four years later, somehow missed during his sprawling inquiry."

Then, in the pandemic summer of 2020, it transformed.\nThe death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police turned the nexus of 16th and H streets into a focal point for decades-old grievances over police brutality and racial inequities.\nThis combination of images shows Black Lives Matter plaza on 16th Street, NW, near the White House on March 10, 2025, top, as work was beginning to remove signage and markings, and on April 1, 2025, after the work was completed. (AP Photo)\nEven before it was named Black Lives Matter Plaza, thousands of protesters descended there daily, many staying around the clock as support tents and infrastructure sprung up. At times, the protests turned violent: A groundskeeper building in the park burned down; the church, St. John\u2019s Episcopal, briefly caught fire; and at least one night saw storefronts destroyed downtown.\nAt other times, the violence was directed at protesters, including when police abruptly used chemical agents to clear out protesters, so President Donald Trump could pose in front of St. John\u2019s holding a Bible.\nLater that year, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered the creation of Black Lives Matter Plaza, with official street signs and \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d painted in giant yellow letters on a multiblock stretch of 16th Street. The move was symbolic, but the impact concrete: BLM Plaza became a magnet point for years of political activism. Hundreds of protests started, ended or rallied there. Semipermanent protesters mingled with tourists; crowds brought vendors and food trucks, creating a street-fair vibe.\nBut Bowser\u2019s move was derided by local activists, who accused her of co-opting an organic movement whose values she did not share. In a brief game of cat-and-mouse, activists erased the stars from the Washington, D.C., flag painted on the street, creating the image of an equal sign; they temporarily changed the message to \u201cBlack Lives Matter = Defund the Police.\u201d\nDespite local resistance, Bowser\u2019s act of public defiance established her as a prominent foil for Trump in his first term.\nNow, the site has changed again, an indicator of America\u2019s political pendulum swings. Bowser announced early this month that the city would remove the words as she struggled with threats of encroachment from Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress.\nThe work was supposed to take at least six weeks, but appears to be finishing ahead of schedule. Workers have completed removing the letters.\nAnd the street signs reading Black Lives Matter Plaza have come down.\n___"

Safe Again\u2019 Initiative\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia is marking President Donald J. Trump's first 100 days by highlighting a 25 percent drop year-to-date in violent crime across the District, credited in part to the \"Make D.C. Safe Again\" initiative and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s partnership with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Metropolitan Police Department.\n\"Thanks to the leadership of President Trump and the efforts of our 'Make D.C.

Martin Jr.\n\"We are proving that strong enforcement and smart policies can make our communities safer,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhen President Trump chose me to be the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, he could have picked anybody, but he picked me, because he knew I am committed to preparing the nation\u2019s capital for America 250, when we welcome the rest of the country and the rest of the world to celebrate America\u2019s founding,\u201d Martin said.\nMartin is also a member of the president\u2019s \u201cMaking DC Safe and Beautiful\u201d Task Force.\n\u201cViolent crime often negatively impacts an entire community, and the victims are often left to pick up the broken pieces.

      "text": "Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Declares a National Emergency at the Southern Border\nINVOKING A NATIONAL EMERGENCY: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order invoking the National Emergencies Act regarding the crisis at the Southern Border of the United States.\n- The Executive Order declares a national emergency at the southern border following four years of record-shattering illegal immigration into the U.S.\n- It directs the Secretary of Defense to deploy additional personnel to the border, including members of the Armed Forces and the National Guard.\n- Additionally, it directs the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security to finish the wall along the southern border and ensures that DHS has all the flexibility it needs to operate air missions near the border.\nTAKING BACK CONTROL: For the past four years, the federal government has abdicated its responsibility to enforce the border, resulting in a catastrophic immigration crisis for the United States.\n- When States like Texas took steps to prevent illegal crossings into their state, the federal government sought to stop them by cutting down their barriers.\n- A record-shattering 8.72 million border encounters have occurred at the southern border from FY21-FY24, overwhelming border resources and endangering communities.\n- This has led to untold hundreds of thousands of children being trafficked. Roughly 550,000 unaccompanied alien children have been encountered at the border since FY21. Fentanyl and other drugs are pouring over the border and flooding our communities, killing roughly 75,000 Americans in 2023\u2014the number one cause of death for Americans ages 18-45.\n- It has allowed dangerous gangs like the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua to takeover and terrorize entire American cities.\n- And it has led to the murders of innocent Americans like Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin, and many others.\nBUILDING ON PAST SUCCESS: America is in a dire situation, and it is past time for the government to act. President Trump first declared an emergency at the Southern Border on February 15, 2019, and continued that emergency on February 13, 2020.\n- Following the at-the-time historic surges of illegal aliens in 2018, President Trump declared a national emergency and successfully reduced the number of people seeking to enter the country illegally.\n- In 2024, President Trump promised to declare an emergency to secure the border and use the military where necessary to protect Americans from foreign threats.\n- This Executive Order will allow the government to gain operational control of the border, combat the cartels, and secure our nation.\n- As President Trump described in 2018: \u201cIllegal immigration affects the lives of all Americans. Illegal immigration hurts American workers; burdens American taxpayers; and undermines public safety; and places enormous strain on local schools, hospitals, and communities in general, taking precious resources away from the poorest Americans who need them most. Illegal immigration costs our country billions and billions of dollars each year\u2026And I will therefore take every lawful action at my disposal to address this crisis. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d"

      "text": "Trump\u2019s rhetoric about DC echoes a history of racist narratives about urban crime\nPresident Trump said he was declaring a public safety emergency, taking over the DC police and calling in National Guard troops to fight crime and tackle homelessness in the nation\u2019s capital. Some DC residents are reacting. (AP Video: River Zhang)\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump has taken control of D.C.'s law enforcement and ordered National Guard troops to deploy onto the streets of the nation\u2019s capital, arguing the extraordinary moves are necessary to curb an urgent public safety crisis.\nEven as district officials questioned the claims underlying his emergency declaration, the Republican president promised a \u201chistoric action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.\u201d His rhetoric echoed that used by conservatives going back decades who have denounced cities, especially those with majority non-white populations or led by progressives, as lawless or crime-ridden and in need of outside intervention.\n\u201cThis is liberation day in D.C., and we\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d Trump promised Monday.\nTrump\u2019s action echoes uncomfortable historical chapters\nAs D.C. the National Guard arrived at their headquarters Tuesday, for many residents, the prospect of federal troops surging into neighborhoods represented an alarming violation of local agency. To some, it echoes uncomfortable historical chapters when politicians used language to paint historically or predominantly Black cities and neighborhoods with racist narratives to shape public opinion and justify aggressive police action.\nApril Goggans, a longtime D.C. resident and grassroots organizer, said she was not surprised by Trump\u2019s actions. Communities had been preparing for a potential federal crackdown in D.C. since the summer of 2020, when Trump deployed troops during racial justice protests after the murder of George Floyd.\n\u201cWe have to be vigilant,\u201d said Goggans, who has coordinated local protests for nearly a decade. She worries about what a surge in law enforcement could mean for residents\u2019 freedoms.\n\u201cRegardless of where you fall on the political scale, understand that this could be you, your children, your grandmother, your co-worker who are brutalized or have certain rights violated,\u201d she said.\nOther residents reacted with mixed feelings to Trump\u2019s executive order. Crime and homelessness has been a top concern for residents in recent years, but opinions on how to solve the issue vary. And very few residents take Trump\u2019s catastrophic view of life in D.C.\n\u201cI think Trump\u2019s trying to help people, some people,\u201d said Melvin Brown, a D.C. resident. \u201cBut as far as (him) trying to get (the) homeless out of this city, that ain\u2019t going to work.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a band-aid to a gunshot wound,\u201d said Melissa Velasquez, a commuter into D.C. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s been an increase of racial profiling and stuff, and so it\u2019s concerning for individuals who are worried about how they might be perceived as they go about their day-to-day lives.\u201d\nUncertainty raises alarms\nAccording to White House officials, troops will be deployed to protect federal assets and facilitate a safe environment for law enforcement to make arrests. The Trump administration believes the highly visible presence of law enforcement will deter violent crime. It is unclear how the administration defines providing a safe environment for law enforcement to conduct arrests, raising alarm bells for some advocates.\n\u201cThe president foreshadowed that if these heavy-handed tactics take root here, they will be rolled out to other majority-Black and Brown cities, like Chicago, Oakland and Baltimore, across the country,\u201d said Monica Hopkins, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s D.C. chapter.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen before how federal control of the D.C. National Guard and police can lead to abuse, intimidation and civil rights violations \u2014 from military helicopters swooping over peaceful racial justice protesters in 2020 to the unchecked conduct of federal officers who remain shielded from full accountability,\u201d Hopkins said.\nA history of denigrating language\nConservatives have for generations used denigrating language to describe the condition of major cities and called for greater law enforcement, often in response to changing demographics in those cities driven by nonwhite populations relocating in search of work or safety from racial discrimination and state violence. Republicans have called for greater police crackdowns in cities since at least the 1965 Watts Riots in Los Angeles.\nPresident Richard Nixon won the White House in 1968 after campaigning on a \u201claw and order\u201d agenda to appeal to white voters in northern cities alongside overtures to white Southerners as part of his \u201cSouthern Strategy.\u201d Ronald Reagan similarly won both his presidential elections after campaigning heavily on law and order politics. Politicians, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former President Bill Clinton have cited the need to tamp down crime as a reason to seize power from liberal cities for decades.\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called Trump\u2019s takeover of local police \u201cunsettling\u201d but not without precedent. Bowser kept a mostly measured tone during a Monday news conference but decried Trump\u2019s reasoning as a \u201cso-called emergency,\u201d saying residents \u201cknow that access to our democracy is tenuous.\u201d\nTrump threatened to \u201ctake over\u201d and \u201cbeautify\u201d D.C. on the campaign trail and claimed it was \u201ca nightmare of murder and crime.\u201d He also argued the city was \u201chorribly run\u201d and said his team intended \u201cto take it away from the mayor.\u201d Trump on Monday repeated old comments about some of the nation\u2019s largest cities, including Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Oakland and his hometown of New York City. All are currently run by Black mayors.\n\u201cYou look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities in a very bad, New York is a problem. And then you have, of course, Baltimore and Oakland. We don\u2019t even mention that anymore. They\u2019re so far gone. We\u2019re not going to let it happen,\u201d he said.\nCivil rights advocates see the rhetoric as part of a broader political strategy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a playbook he\u2019s used in the past,\u201d said Maya Wiley, CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric \u201cpaints a picture that crime is out of control, even when it is not true, then blames the policies of Democratic lawmakers that are reform- and public safety-minded, and then claims that you have to step in and violate people\u2019s rights or demand that reforms be reversed,\u201d Wiley said.\nShe added that the playbook has special potency in D.C. because local law enforcement can be directly placed under federal control, a power Trump invoked in his announcement.\nLeaders call the order an unjustified distraction\nTrump\u2019s actions in Washington and comments about other major cities sent shock waves across the country, as other leaders prepare to respond to potential federal action.\nDemocratic Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said in a statement that Trump\u2019s plan \u201clacks seriousness and is deeply dangerous\u201d and pointed to a 30-year-low crime rate in Baltimore as a reason the administration should consult local leaders rather than antagonize them. In Oakland, Mayor Barbara Lee called Trump\u2019s characterization of the city \u201cfearmongering.\u201d\nThe administration already faced a major flashpoint between local control and federal power earlier in the summer, when Trump deployed National Guard troops to quell protests and support immigration enforcement operations in LA despite opposition from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass.\nCivil rights leaders have denounced Trump\u2019s action in D.C. as an unjustified distraction.\n\u201cThis president campaigned on \u2018law and order,\u2019 but he is the president of chaos and corruption,\u201d said NAACP President Derrick Johnson. \u201cThere\u2019s no emergency in D.C., so why would he deploy the National Guard? To distract us from his alleged inclusion in the Epstein files? To rid the city of unhoused people? D.C. has the right to govern itself. It doesn\u2019t need this federal coup.\u201d\n\u2014\nAssociated Press writer River Zhang contributed reporting."

      "text": "FACT FOCUS: Trump exaggerates, misstates facts on Washington crime\nFACT FOCUS: Trump exaggerates, misstates facts on Washington crime\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Monday that his administration will take over policing the nation\u2019s capital city in what the Republican said is an effort to bring down rising crime rates in Washington, D.C.\nBut Trump exaggerated or misstated many of the facts surrounding public safety in Washington, where the crime rate has fallen in recent years, while leaving out much of the context.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the facts:\nStatistics rebut Trump\u2019s claims about violent crime in Washington\nTRUMP: \u201cIt\u2019s getting worse, not getting better. It\u2019s getting worse.\u201d\nTHE FACTS: Statistics published by Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police contradict the president and show violent crime has dropped in Washington since a post-pandemic peak in 2023.\nAccording to the data, homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. Overall, violent crime is down 26% compared with this time a year ago.\nA recent Department of Justice report shows that violent crime is down 35% since 2023, returning to the previous trend of decreasing crime that puts the district\u2019s violent crime rate at its lowest in 30 years.\nThat report shows that when compared to 2023 numbers, homicides are down 32%, armed carjackings are down 53% and assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 27%.\nThe city\u2019s statistics have come into question, however, after authorities opened an investigation into allegations that officials altered some of the data to make it look better. But Mayor Muriel Bowser stands by the data and said Trump\u2019s portrait of lawlessness is inaccurate.\n\u201cWe are not experiencing a spike in crime,\u201d Bowser said on MSNBC Sunday. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re watching our crime numbers go down.\u201d\nMurders in 2023 in Washington were high, but not the highest ever\nTRUMP: \u201cMurders in 2023 reached the highest rate, probably ever. They say 25 years, but they don\u2019t know what that means because it just goes back 25 years.\u201d\nTHE FACTS: In 2023, the District of Columbia recorded 274 murders in a city of about 700,000, its highest number in 20 years. But the city\u2019s own crime statistics from the 1970s, 80s and 90s, when the population was smaller, show much higher numbers of homicides.\nIn 1990, for instance, the city reported 498 homicides. The next year saw 509, and 460 in 1992.\nDecades of statistics on crime in the city are available online.\nWashington murder rate compared to international capitals\nTRUMP: \u201cThe murder rate in Washington today is higher than that of Bogota, Colombia, Mexico City. Some of the places that you hear about as being the worst places on Earth, much higher. This is much higher.\u201d\nTHE FACTS: It\u2019s true, but Trump isn\u2019t telling the whole story. Washington does have a higher homicide rate than many other global cities, including some that have historically been considered unsafe by many Americans. But Trump is leaving out important context: the U.S. in general sees higher violent crime rates than many other countries.\nWhile Washington is one of America\u2019s most dangerous big cities, others have higher crime rates.\nTrump blames cashless bail for crime without evidence\nTRUMP : \u201cThis dire public safety crisis stems from a public safety crisis that is directly from the abject failures of the city\u2019s local leadership. The radical left City Council adopted no cash bail. By the way, every place in the country where you have no cash bail is a disaster.\u201d\nTHE FACTS: Data has not determined the impact of cashless bail on crime rates. Studies, many of which focus on recidivism of defendants rather than crime rates, have shown mixed results.\nA 2024 report published by the Brennan Center for Justice saw \u201cno statistically significant relationship\u201d between bail reform and crime rates. The nonprofit looked at crime rate data from 2015 through 2021 for 33 cities across the U.S., 22 of which had instituted some type of bail reform. Researchers used a statistical method to determine if crime rates had diverged in those with reforms and those without.\nAmes Grawert, the report\u2019s co-author and senior counsel in the Brennan Center\u2019s Justice Program, said this conclusion \u201cholds true for trends in crime overall or specifically violent crime.\u201d\nSimilarly, a 2023 paper published in the American Economic Journal found no evidence that cash bail helps ensure defendants will show up in court or prevents crime among those who are released while awaiting trial.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any valid studies corroborating the President\u2019s claim and would love to know what the Administration offers in support,\u201d Kellen Funk, a professor at Columbia Law School who studies pretrial procedure and bail bonding, told The Associated Press in a July 25 fact check. \u201cIn my professional judgment I\u2019d call the claim demonstrably false and inflammatory.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has cited a 2022 report from the district attorney\u2019s office in Yolo County, California, that looked at how a temporary cashless bail system implemented across the state to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in courts and jails impacted recidivism. It found that out of 595 individuals released between April 2020 and May 2021 under this system, 70.6% were arrested again after they were released.\nFunk, contacted Monday, noted that Washington D.C. reformed its cash bail system in the 1990s.\n\u201cWhat the President is declaring to be an \u2018emergency\u2019 is a system that has functioned much better than cash-based bail systems for nearly thirty years now, including during the recent historic lows in reported crime in the District,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe D.C. bail system has served as a model for bipartisan bail reform efforts in New Jersey and New Mexico over the past decade.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writer Melissa Goldin in New York contributed reporting.\n___\nFind AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck."

  "argos_summary": "President Trump has declared a public safety emergency in Washington, D.C., taking control of the Metropolitan Police Department and deploying National Guard troops to address crime and homelessness, despite local officials asserting that crime rates are at a 30-year low. Mayor Muriel Bowser criticized Trump's actions as unnecessary and illegal, emphasizing that the city's crime statistics do not support his claims of a crisis. The situation reflects a contentious relationship between Trump and D.C. officials, with concerns about federal overreach and the implications for local governance.",
