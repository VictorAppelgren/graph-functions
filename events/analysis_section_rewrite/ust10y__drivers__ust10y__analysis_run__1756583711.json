      "feedback": "The draft is a solid, data‑driven narrative but still drifts from the strict “asset‑centric, causal‑chain” mandate and over‑relies on generic phrasing. Tighten the focus to the S&P 500 by removing any mention of the 30‑year mortgage rate unless it is explicitly linked to equity discount‑rate pressure (e.g., “the 6.55 % mortgage rate, a proxy for long‑term rates, signals Fed‑driven discount‑rate compression that will weigh on spx” with a citation). Replace vague “Fed tightening keeps the federal funds rate high” with a quantified link: “Fed‑set 2‑yr/10‑yr spread widening of 57 bp (Z7O1DCHS7) raises the equity discount rate by ~30 bp, implying a 3–5 % spx decline” (cite Z7O1DCHS7). Explicitly map each claim to a canonical handle: e.g., Fed policy → fed_policy, 2‑yr/10‑yr spread → ust2y/ust10y, spx → spx, DXY → dxy. Add a clear causal chain diagram in text: Fed policy → short‑term rate → term premium → ust10y → equity discount rate → spx. Quantify the upside/downside ranges with source IDs: “If the Fed cuts in September (B1KYJ1GPU), spx rises 3–5 % (B1KYJ1GPU); if rates stay high (FAN5RYW6T), spx falls 5–10 %.” Tighten the catalyst window: “July CPI/PCE (B1KYJ1GPU), September Fed meeting (B1KYJ1GPU), Aug 30 PCE (7XH2DKEKV), Aug 31 NFP (7XH2DKEKV)”. Remove any mention of “30‑year mortgage rate” unless directly tied to spx via discount‑rate compression. Finally, replace generic “confidence is moderate” with a quantified risk assessment: “Given the 86 % probability of a September cut (Z7O1DCHS7) and the 57 bp spread steepening, the spx upside is 3–5 % with a 20 % chance of a 5–10 % downside if inflation remains sticky (FAN5RYW6T).” This will satisfy the truth‑over‑verbosity rule, ensure every claim is evidence‑based, and keep the analysis tightly scoped to the S&P 500 with explicit handles and catalysts.",
