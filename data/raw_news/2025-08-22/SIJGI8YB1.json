  "title": "The Truth About Cruise Ship Internet And How To Get It Cheaper",
  "description": "Cruise ship internet is faster and more reliable than ever, but it is still expensive. Here\u2019s how to stay connected while you sail without blowing your budget.",
  "content": "Until recently, cruise ship internet had a reputation for being slow, patchy, and overpriced. Modern systems have improved dramatically, but the price tag has not shifted much. Mainstream cruise lines still treat connectivity as a premium add-on.\n\nEven with Starlink and other low-orbit networks, the infrastructure costs are significant. The hardware is expensive and bandwidth must be shared among thousands of passengers and crew members. When demand peaks, such as during sea days, speeds can slow.\n\nMost lines charge either by the day or for the duration of the cruise, with higher-tier packages including access to streaming services such as YouTube. The costs quickly add up, especially on longer sailings and on lines that charge by device.\n\nRoyal Caribbean was among the first major cruise lines to install Starlink across its fleet, with Carnival, Norwegian, and others following suit. The difference for passengers is noticeable: faster browsing, smoother video calls, and the ability to stream without constant buffering.\n\nHowever, speeds vary depending on the ship\u2019s location and the number of people online at the same time. And while the experience has improved, prices have not dropped significantly. In some cases, cruise lines have increased package rates to reflect the higher quality.\n\nWhy You Can\u2019t Bring Your Own Starlink\n\nAlthough Starlink has transformed cruise ship internet, there is a major word of warning. Cruise lines including Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, Disney, MSC, and Celebrity now ban passenger-owned Starlink units, satellite dishes, routers, and similar equipment.\n\nThe rule is actively enforced: in one case, a YouTuber\u2019s Starlink Mini was confiscated mid-cruise after outperforming the ship\u2019s Wi-Fi, prompting Carnival to update its banned items list. Penalties can include confiscation, fines, or even a ban from future sailings.\n\nDangers Of Using Mobile Data At Sea\n\nOne of the most common and costly mistakes new cruise passengers make is assuming their regular data roaming plan works anywhere the ship sails. While your roaming package might cover you in many countries, it almost certainly does not cover maritime roaming.\n\nWhen the ship is at sea, your cellphone may automatically connect to a satellite-based maritime network operated by a provider like CellAtSea.\n\nThese are not included in standard roaming packages, and the rates can be shockingly high. It is not uncommon for travelers to return home to bills running into the hundreds or even thousands of dollars for just a few hours of accidental use.\n\nTo avoid this, keep your phone in airplane mode when the ship is not in port. You can still connect to the ship\u2019s Wi-Fi, take photos, play downloaded music and more when in airplane mode.\n\nIf your itinerary has few sea days, you might be able to skip the ship\u2019s Wi-Fi entirely and rely on mobile data while docked. Some international roaming packages now include generous allowances in popular cruise destinations.\n\nBefore you sail, check whether your plan covers every country on your route and understand the daily or monthly caps. Once in port, you can hotspot from your cellphone to your laptop or tablet, giving you full access without paying cruise ship rates.\n\nIt\u2019s a much easier and more secure option than seeking out free Wi-Fi in port terminals or public spaces. However, some cities do offer municipal Wi-Fi networks near cruise docks.\n\nFor travelers who want more flexibility, prepaid eSIMs are a smart option. These digital SIM cards, available from providers like Airalo, Holafly, and Nomad, can be activated instantly on compatible phones. Many offer regional plans that work across multiple countries, making them ideal for multi-stop cruises.\n\nTraditionally, eSIMs only worked on land, but some cruise ships are now enabling at-sea connections through networks like Telenor Maritime and Red Bull Mobile.\n\nThis means that, if you are technically inclined, you may be able to get satellite connectivity at a lower cost than the ship\u2019s official Wi-Fi package. The setup can be a little complex, and you will need an unlocked phone, but for heavy data users it can be worth the effort.\n\nIn practice, the best approach is often a mix. Use cellphone data or eSIMs in port, make use of free Wi-Fi where you find it, and limit your paid shipboard internet to essential tasks.\n\nDownload maps, entertainment, and work files before embarkation so you can function offline when needed.\n\nIf you do decide to buy the cruise line\u2019s Wi-Fi, you can still save by pre-purchasing it before you sail, when rates are often lower. Loyalty programmes, credit card perks, or promotional packages may include complimentary or discounted internet access.\n\nThe Case For Going Offline Entirely\n\nWhile staying connected is important for many travelers, a cruise can also be an opportunity for a digital detox.\n\nThe experience is, after all, about being at sea, not glued to your inbox. Many seasoned cruisers set specific times for checking messages in port, then put their phones away for the rest of the day.\n\nCruise ship internet has improved enormously in speed and reliability, but it remains a pricey extra. By understanding how maritime connectivity works and planning ahead, you can stay online for a fraction of the cost.\n\nWhether that means relying on your own data plan in port, setting up a prepaid eSIM or simply taking a break from the digital world, the choice is yours. Your next cellphone bill will thank you for it.",

      "text": "Booking your first cruise can be exciting, as cruise lines continue to expand their offerings with bigger ships, broader itineraries, and new experiences at sea.\nBut for passengers new to cruising, this variety can also be overwhelming. It is easy to fall into common traps that can impact your enjoyment, and your budget.\nHere are ten of the most common mistakes first-time cruisers make, along with practical tips to help you avoid them.\n1. Booking The Wrong Cruise Line\nNot all cruise lines are created equal. Some focus on family-friendly activities, while others cater to older travelers or those looking for a more refined experience.\nChoosing based solely on price or itinerary is a mistake many first-timers make. Research each cruise line\u2019s typical clientele, entertainment style, dining options, and atmosphere.\nFor example, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line offer large resort-style ships with extensive onboard entertainment like water slides and shows, while Cunard and Holland America lean toward traditional cruising with a quieter, more formal feel.\nEven within the same cruise line, ships can vary significantly in size, style, and onboard atmosphere.\nFor instance, P&O Cruises operates both Arvia and Iona, which are large, family-friendly megaships, but the line also owns Aurora, a smaller, adults-only ship offering a much more traditional cruising experience.\n2. Arriving On The Day Of Departure\nWhile it is possible to arrive in your embarkation city the morning of your cruise, it is a significant risk. Delayed or canceled flights, missed connections, and even traffic can result in a stressful day, or even a missed departure.\nUnless you live close to the port, plan to arrive at least one day in advance. This is especially important when international travel is involved.\nCruise Blog\u2019s Elizabeth Wright said that starting your vacation with peace of mind is worth the cost of one night in a hotel: \"Instead of relying on luck and hoping my flight departs on time, I prefer to fly out the night before. This way, I can have a relaxing embarkation morning that isn't plagued with anxiety over whether I'll make the ship.\"\n3. Packing Mishaps\nPacking too much is a common mistake among first-time cruisers. Cabins typically offer limited storage, and many newcomers overpack, assuming they will need multiple outfits per day.\n\"Most cruising these days is casual, and you really only need a few outfits to rotate through a voyage,\" explained The Points Guy\u2019s Gene Sloan, who added that in the worst-case scenarios, it\u2019s always possible to do laundry on board.\nHowever, there are key items you should not forget. Bring a carry-on with essential items for embarkation day, such as medications, swimwear, and a change of clothes. It can take several hours for your checked luggage to arrive at your cabin.\nAlso, check your cruise line\u2019s rules in advance. Items like travel irons, kettles, and surge-protected power strips are usually prohibited.\n4. Ignoring The Cruise Line App\nMost major cruise lines now offer mobile apps that are essential tools once onboard. These apps allow you to check the daily schedule, make dining reservations, book activities, view your onboard account, and sometimes even unlock your cabin door.\nDownload and log into the app before you arrive at the port. Internet access may be limited at sea, but most apps function through the ship\u2019s internal network,without needing to buy an expensive internet package.\n5. Automatically Adding A Drinks Package\nBeverage packages are heavily promoted by all cruise lines and can appear to offer good value. However, they are not always the best financial choice.\nThe cost of these packages varies by cruise line and itinerary. In many cases, you would need to consume a high number of alcoholic beverages per day to break even.\nConsider your usual drinking habits, how many days you will spend at sea (on which you\u2019ll likely consume more), and what beverages are already included in your fare.\nSome packages also include non-alcoholic drinks, specialty coffees, and bottled water, which may improve the value for some travelers.\n6. Eating Every Meal At The Buffet\nBuffet restaurants are convenient, but relying on them exclusively means missing out on elevated dining experiences. Most cruise lines offer main dining rooms with table service, multi-course menus, and often higher-quality food.\nThese are included in your fare and can provide a more relaxing and enjoyable mealtime experience. In some cases, you are not even limited to one starter or main course.\nDon\u2019t forget that main dining rooms are typically open for breakfast too, and usually lunch on sea days. This environment is often a much calmer way to start your day than the bustle of the breakfast buffet.\n7. Booking Ship Excursions For Every Port\nCruise lines offer a wide range of shore excursions, but they are often priced at a premium. While they can be convenient, especially in complex or remote destinations, not every port requires a guided tour.\nResearch your destinations in advance. In some cases, attractions are within walking distance or easily reached by public transportation, taxi, or a local sightseeing bus. You may be able to plan your own day ashore for a fraction of the cost.\n8. Failing To Monitor Onboard Spending\nWhile many cruise experiences are included in your fare, extras can add up quickly. This includes specialty dining, drinks, spa treatments, Wi-Fi access, laundry services, and gratuities.\nMost cruise lines allow you to track your spending through the app or your cabin television. Check your account regularly to avoid surprises at the end of your trip and to catch any billing errors early.\n9. Missing Promotions And Port-Day Discounts\nCruise lines often run special offers on spa treatments, fitness classes, and specialty dining. However, these are often on port days when many passengers are ashore.\nIf there is a premium experience you are interested in, check for promotions either on embarkation day or during quieter times. Booking a massage or dinner on a port day can save money and provide a more peaceful experience.\n10. Trying To Do Everything\nWith so much going on, from shows and trivia games to water slides and wine tastings, it is easy to overschedule yourself. Many first-time cruisers make the mistake of trying to attend every event and eat in every venue, only to burn out midway through the trip.\nThe golden rule is to pace yourself. If a particular port does not interest you, consider staying on board to enjoy the ship while it is quieter. Taking a slower approach allows you to appreciate the cruise experience rather than rushing through it.\nCruising can be a relaxing and enjoyable way to travel, but only if you plan accordingly. By avoiding these common mistakes, you will be better prepared to enjoy your time at sea and make the most of your first cruise."

      "text": "Shore excursions are a major part of cruising, offering a chance to experience the culture, history, and natural beauty of each destination on the itinerary.\nDeciding how to explore each port can feel overwhelming, especially when balancing the convenience and peace of mind of cruise line tours against the freedom and potential savings of going it alone.\nMany experienced cruise travelers mix and match, booking cruise line excursions for more ambitious trips or riskier destinations and doing their own thing in walkable cities or familiar ports.\nThe key is to weigh the cost against the convenience, and always plan with the ship\u2019s departure time in mind. Here\u2019s when it makes sense to stick with the ship\u2019s own excursions.\nShort Port Calls Leave No Room For Error\nMost cruise ship port calls last most of the day. However, half-day port calls, often used as a \u201cpit stop\u201d on the way to or from an itinerary\u2019s main destinations, make time ashore much tighter.\nCruise line excursions are timed with the ship\u2019s schedule and come with a vital guarantee: if your tour runs late, the ship will wait.\nIndependent travelers don\u2019t enjoy the same protection. Miss the \u2018all aboard\u2019 time and you\u2019ll be making your own way to the next port at your own expense.\nThis safety net is often worth the higher cost, especially in destinations with unpredictable traffic, ferries, or long distances between the port and the main attractions.\nComplex Logistics Made Simple\nSome shore excursions involve more than a bus ride and a walking tour. Think glacier hikes in Alaska, guided snorkeling trips from a tender port, or multi-leg journeys involving trains, boats, or 4x4s.\nCruise lines work with vetted local partners and handle all the coordination, leaving you to relax and enjoy the experience.\nIn remote or logistically complex destinations like Iceland\u2019s volcanic interior or the jungle ruins of Mexico and Central America, cruise line tours reduce the stress and risk of tackling these places on your own.\nIn countries where safety is a concern or where few locals speak English, the comfort and structure of a cruise line excursion can go a long way. Guides are usually bilingual and you\u2019re less likely to be exposed to uncomfortable situations.\nEven in safer or better-known destinations, certain experiences are only available through the cruise line due to exclusive access or limited capacity.\nExamples include after-hours visits to historic sites or behind-the-scenes access at cultural institutions. If something catches your eye that you couldn\u2019t reasonably book yourself, it might be worth the splurge.\nUse Onboard Credit On Shore Excursions\nMany cruise passengers receive onboard credit as part of a booking promotion, a loyalty perk, or compensation for itinerary changes. While this credit can be spent on anything from cocktails to spa treatments, using it on a shore excursion can be a smart move.\nThat\u2019s especially true if it means ticking off a once-in-a-lifetime experience like a helicopter ride over a glacier or a guided tour of a world wonder.\nSince most cruise lines allow you to apply onboard credit toward excursion bookings, it\u2019s an easy way to offset the premium price while still getting the convenience and security of an official tour.\nIndependent Shore Excursions Have Their Place\nThat said, going it alone can be incredibly rewarding and often cheaper. If you're returning to a familiar port, simply want to wander a local town, or plan to hire a private guide with excellent reviews, an independent option may suit you better.\nThe same is true for smaller ports, in which options for independent tours may be limited.\nNorway\u2019s Fl\u00e5m Railway is a good example of an excursion that can be booked independently. The station is just a few minutes\u2019 walk from the cruise ship port, and independent passengers will share the train (albeit in different carriages) with people booked on official excursions.\nFor independent options such as this, booking in advance is essential to avoid disappointment.\nBefore booking a cruise line deal, check services such as Shore Excursions Group, Get Your Guide, or Viator to see what\u2019s available.\nJust be sure to leave plenty of time to return to the ship, keep an eye on local traffic or weather disruptions, and carry contact details for the port agent, the cruise line, and a local taxi company, just in case."

      "text": "Although they are hugely popular, cruise ships are far from sustainable. Traditional vessels burn heavy fuel oil, emit significant greenhouse gases, and rely on complex global supply chains.\nBut in Norway, where environmental awareness runs deep and maritime innovation has long been a national strength, a pair of cruise companies are showing how a cleaner future may already be within reach.\nWith environmental requirements baked into government contracts, the ships serving Norway\u2019s historic Bergen\u2013Kirkenes coastal route are at the forefront of green maritime innovation.\nThe two operating companies\u2014Hurtigruten and Havila Voyages\u2014are taking different but equally ambitious approaches to decarbonizing maritime transport.\nThe wider cruise industry is watching closely, and for good reason. What\u2019s happening in Norway could shape the global cruise sector\u2019s path forward.\nHavila: Cleaner LNG, Carbon Capture\nHavila Voyages has already made headlines by launching four of the world\u2019s most environmentally friendly passenger vessels, now in operation along the coast of Norway.\nThese coastal cruise ferries run on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and battery power, cutting carbon dioxide emissions by up to 40% compared to conventional ships. When powered by liquid biogas, that figure rises to as much as 90%.\nNow, Havila is going a step further. Through a research initiative called LNGameChanger, the company is working with Norwegian technology partners to develop an onboard carbon capture system.\nThe idea is to use solid oxide fuel cells to generate electricity from LNG while simultaneously capturing the resulting carbon dioxide, liquefying it, and storing it on the ship for later offloading at port.\nLNGameChanger is backed by the Norwegian Research Council and involves maritime technology firm HAV Group, LNG supplier Molgas, and research institute SINTEF.\nFeasibility studies, voyage simulations, and infrastructure planning are already underway to prepare Havila\u2019s LNG-powered fleet as testbeds for the new system.\nAs many of the world\u2019s newest megaships now run on LNG, the success of this research project could have wide-reaching implications for the entire cruise industry.\nHurtigruten: All-Electric Innovation\nWhile Havila focuses on upgrading today\u2019s tech, Hurtigruten is attempting to design the cruise ship of tomorrow from scratch. Its Sea Zero project aims to launch the world\u2019s first fully zero-emission cruise vessel by 2030.\nThat\u2019s a bold goal given the energy demands of large ships, so, to get there, Hurtigruten is completely rethinking ship design.\nThe eye-catching prototype includes a sleek, energy-efficient hull, retractable sails for wind-assisted propulsion, an air lubrication system that reduces drag, and contra-rotating propellers for optimized thrust. Power will come from large battery packs charged with green electricity at ports along the route.\nSea Zero brings together leading Norwegian players including shipbuilder Vard, propulsion specialist Brunvoll, and researchers at SINTEF.\nRecent testing at SINTEF\u2019s labs in Trondheim has shown encouraging results. The innovative design could reduce energy use by as much as 50% compared to current vessels, making full battery operation between charging ports a viable option under normal conditions.\nAccording to Hurtigruten CEO Hedda Felin, the project is about future-proofing the company for the next century of sailing along the Norwegian coast.\nTwo Paths, One Destination\nBoth companies are targeting 2030 as a milestone for more sustainable cruising.\nHavila, which has already demonstrated the success of large-scale battery technology, is now exploring onboard carbon capture systems to reduce emissions from its LNG-powered fleet. Hurtigruten is aiming for a zero-emission reinvention of the cruise ship itself.\nTheir approaches differ, but their goals are shared: dramatically reduce emissions, showcase Norwegian maritime innovation, and preserve the pristine coastline they both call home.\nSo, can cruise ships ever be truly sustainable? Norway\u2019s answer is a resounding \u201cyes\u201d, but it will only come as a result of bold investment, deep collaboration and a willingness to rethink everything we know about cruise ships."

And sometimes the policy page isn\u2019t as up to date with modern devices.\nA YouTuber, Richard with the channel \u2018No Pants Profits\u2019, recently found himself in a bit of hot water while cruising aboard Carnival Miracle.\nAfter using a Starlink Mini satellite dish to improve his internet connection on the ship, he was approached by security and the device was confiscated.\n\u201cI know what this was about,\u201d the YouTuber explained in a video. \u201cThey wanted to talk to me in the hotel director\u2019s office.\u201d\nRichard revealed that Carnival\u2019s chief information officer had been sent a video showing the use of the Starlink Mini and had instructed the ship to confiscate it.\nDespite the device being technically allowed on board, the cruise line argued that it was a \u201csatellite disk\u201d rather than a \u201csatellite dish,\u201d a claim the YouTuber disputed when referring to the wording of the policy.\nCarnival\u2019s Prohibited Item list includes the following:\n- Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRB), communication scanners, wideband receivers, satellite phones, transformers, lasers and laser pointers.\n- Satellite dish, routers and other internet related equipment\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to fight them. I gave it up. I just had three simple requests,\u201d Richard said. He wanted some paperwork to show that the device was being confiscated, and he wanted an Airtag attached to it so he could track it.\nThirdly, Richard wanted the device to be treated as a drone so he could get the Starlink Mini back when he was in port so he could have internet when off the ship.\nRichard added that he was disappointed with Carnival\u2019s decision to confiscate the Starlink Mini, especially considering the poor Wi-Fi speeds he experienced while on the ship.\nHe noted that he would likely be unable to use the device again on future Carnival cruises but expressed hope that other cruise lines would be more accepting of such technology.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s important to understand,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies hate competition. This is competition.\u201d\nIn the video, Richard showed a download speed of about 3.5 Mbps when connected to the ship\u2019s WiFi. In comparison, he was able to reach download speeds of 140Mbps with Starlink.\nWith a few crass comments about the cruise line and a promise that he will come back stronger, Richard ended the video, noting that he was not banned from Carnival.\nCruise ships are increasingly adopting Starlink to provide passengers with reliable high-speed internet access, enhancing the overall onboard experience.\nIn fact, earlier this year, Carnival announced that Starlink was available on every ship in the fleet.\nOf course, if there are a lot of people using the WiFi it could present a problem with slower speeds.\nLooking for the Best Cruise Deals?\nSearch Multiple Sites at Once\nInstant Real Time Pricing\nSearch Now"

      "text": "Many cruise lines make alterations to their itineraries before sailing. In late 2024, Carnival guests were notified of itinerary adjustments for five cruise ships in early 2025 and 2026, impacting various ports in the Bahamas.\nThese changes include port replacements, modified times, and shifts to 11 itineraries, giving guests at least four months to modify their plans if necessary.\nWhile Carnival\u2019s adjustments were minor, cruise lines can make significant changes before or even during sailings. For example, many world cruises planned for 2025 and 2026 have seen major changes due to the need to avoid certain parts of the world.\nLet\u2019s explore why these changes happen, and how you can minimize the risk of booking a cruise that ends up being changed.\nAdvance Changes By Cruise Lines\nCruise lines may adjust itineraries well in advance for several reasons, often tied to global events or local regulations. For instance, political instability or conflict can make certain destinations inaccessible or undesirable.\nA prominent example is the suspension of cruises to Saint Petersburg following travel restrictions and security concerns following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Baltic cruises now typically feature additional stops in Scandinavian cities like Stockholm, Helsinki, and Copenhagen to compensate for the change.\nRegulatory changes in specific regions also play a significant role. Norway\u2019s World Heritage fjords ruling, which aims to ban polluting ships from several iconic fjords, has influenced itinerary planning.\nWhile the regulation\u2019s implementation has been postponed to 2032, some cruise lines preemptively altered their routes to comply with expected environmental standards.\nWith anti-cruise protests gathering pace, some destinations are cracking down on the type, size and number of ships that can visit. As itineraries are planned years in advance, this can force lines to change their plans.\nEconomic factors can also drive changes. If a particular cruise isn\u2019t selling well, lines might rework itineraries to include more desirable or profitable ports. Similarly, underperforming destinations may be swapped out for trending hotspots that attract more bookings.\nThese adjustments allow cruise lines to optimize revenue while meeting passenger demand.\nFinally, operational considerations such as port infrastructure upgrades, berth availability, or seasonal weather patterns might necessitate changes.\nLast-Minute Changes To Cruises\nBooking a trip on a cruise ship\u2019s maiden voyage has great appeal, being among the first people in the world to set sail on a brand new ship. However, the risk of delays or cancelations to maiden voyages are high.\nNew cruise ships are incredibly complex, and construction delays are common. Also, before a new cruise ship can carry paying guests, it must undergo extensive sea trials and receive certifications from regulatory bodies. Sometimes, unexpected issues are found that must be addressed before the ship is cleared.\nSuch issues don\u2019t just impact new builds. In the worst case, entire cruises can be canceled shortly before sailing due to overrunning maintenance. For this reason, booking a cruise immediately following a period of maintenance (known as \u201cdry dock\u201d) carries a higher risk of disruption.\nOperational Changes During A Cruise\nThe most likely reason for a change in itinerary is the weather and/or sea conditions. Safety always comes first on a cruise, and it is the captain\u2019s decision that will ultimately decide.\nHowever, local maritime pilots and port authorities will also provide influence. Local pilots have extensive knowledge of the specific conditions and challenges in their waters, including currents, tides, and harbor limitations.\nSome ports are more difficult to enter than others. For example, Libson often proves challenging due to its exposure to the Atlantic Ocean and tidal influence along the navigation through the Tagus River. In Northern Norway, the narrow channels entering Bod\u00f8 can be difficult to navigate during high winds.\nMedical emergencies can also lead to sudden itinerary changes. If a passenger or crew member requires urgent medical attention that cannot be managed onboard, the captain may divert the ship to the nearest port with adequate facilities.\nIn some cases, this might mean bypassing or delaying scheduled stops, particularly if the medical need is critical and the ship is far from land.\nMechanical issues are another possible reason for itinerary adjustments. While modern cruise ships undergo rigorous maintenance and safety checks, unforeseen mechanical problems can arise, sometimes affecting propulsion or essential systems.\nIn these cases, the captain and operations team may decide to shorten or skip a port to ensure repairs are completed safely and efficiently, minimizing disruption to the overall cruise experience.\nPotential itinerary changes are just one reason why obtaining adequate cruise-specific travel insurance is essential. Many policies cover expenses related to canceled excursions and may even offer compensation if a port is missed."

  "argos_summary": "Cruise ship internet has improved significantly with the introduction of technologies like Starlink, yet prices remain high and connectivity is often treated as a premium add-on. Passengers are cautioned against using personal satellite devices like Starlink due to strict bans by cruise lines, which enforce penalties for violations. Additionally, first-time cruisers are advised to avoid common mistakes such as overpacking, relying solely on cruise line excursions, and neglecting to monitor onboard spending, to enhance their overall experience.",
