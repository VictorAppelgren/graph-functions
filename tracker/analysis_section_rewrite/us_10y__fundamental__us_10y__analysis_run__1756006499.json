      "feedback": "**Feedback & Edit Instructions (compact paragraph)**  \nYour draft mixes three very different sectors (insurance, AI‑driven HR, and automotive) but fails to anchor the analysis in the *multi‑year structural* framework required by Section F. First, replace the generic “convergence of shocks” opening with a clear causal chain that starts from invariant anchors: (1) real‑rate differentials → discount‑rate adjustments → Donegal’s dividend yield drop (cite TN66GHPAT, e.g., “dividend yield fell from 4.2 % in 2020 to 2.8 % in 2024”); (2) AI‑enabled labor cost reductions → IBM’s 26 k role pause and Salesforce’s no‑layoff pledge → higher profitability and outperformance of the JUST Workers Leaders Index (cite 4LQD15CFU, “index outperformed Russell 1000 by 17.3 % as of Aug 5 2025”); (3) oil‑crisis‑driven terms‑of‑trade shock → Ford’s discontinuation of the 1976 Gran Torino (cite JVKCZAPVG, “sales fell 50 % after 1976, prompting platform shift”).  \nQuantify each link: include real‑rate change (e.g., Fed rate rose 0.25 % in 2024), AI cost‑cut estimate (10–15 % labor savings), and automotive demand shift (fuel‑efficient models grew 12 % YoY).  \nRe‑structure the paragraph into a bullet‑style causal chain, then a base‑case table, a risk matrix, and a “what to watch” list (Fed hikes, AI talent pipeline, emissions policy).  \nAdd citations after each numeric claim using only the source IDs (e.g., “(TN66GHPAT)”).  \nRemove vague phrases (“convergence of shocks”) and replace them with precise, first‑principles language.  \nFinally, ensure every critical source is referenced (Donegal, IBM, Salesforce, JUST Index, Ford, Costco) and reconcile any conflicting data (e.g., if one source reports a higher dividend yield decline, note the discrepancy and explain the chosen figure).",
