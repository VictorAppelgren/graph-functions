      "feedback": "Overall assessment: the piece rightly ties policy, AI productivity, and select asset/story channels to a 3–6 month horizon but fails to deliver a structured scenario map with timing, triggers, and invalidations, and the causal chain from policy to market/flows to valuation is only partially explicit; it would benefit from tighter quantification, fuller cross‑source reconciliation, and a clearer watch‑list with concrete thresholds. Actionable edit plan (anchor claims to the included IDs): build a three‑scenario tree (base, alt1, alt2) for 3–6 months with explicit timing windows (e.g., 0–60 days policy vote/offsets, 60–120 days debt/yield readouts, 120–180 days AI/tech adoption milestones) and clear invalidation triggers (e.g., failure to pass offsets, deviation in debt‑to‑GDP trajectory, or FDA/Medicare steps stalling HeartSciences adoption); map each channel end‑to‑end: policy path (Big Beautiful Bill totals: $2.4T debt addition, $4.4T tax relief) to deficits, rate expectations, risk premia, and sector flows, citing EPJYXB7DX and FOM34PUWA where relevant; anchor AI productivity/markets via Range’s productivity gains (~1–1.5% annual productivity lift, 78M net new jobs) and the 21% YoY volume growth plus 18.8% IRR and 10–12% cash‑on‑cash yields from Pacaso/mogul, plus 40% of Americans’ vacation‑home demand (UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F); integrate HeartSciences (FDA pathway, Medicare reimbursement began 2025; $32B ECG market) and UAS Grand Forks data (97% rise in UAS jobs, avg. salary ~$106k) to illustrate backdrop risks and upside in health tech and defense/aerospace (ILYC1M41F, FOM34PUWA); quantify consumer/discretionary tilt with Douglas tires data (40k–60k mile lifespans, 50k warranty) to show price‑sensitivity channels (V8TEZOR8R); ensure every factual assertion includes a source tag and reconcile conflicts, e.g., growth‑supporting deficits vs. debt risk in the same window; add 1–2 alt scenarios that hinge on either policy clarity or policy drag and specify event‑driven milestones that would invalidate each scenario; increase density by referencing all critical sources for the linked claims (EPJYXB7DX, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, FOM34PUWA, V8TEZOR8R) and, where relevant, note the private/venture nature of Pacaso/mogul and the potential uncertainty around healthcare regulatory milestones; tighten the causal chain into a clean, end‑to‑end logic: policy move → macro debt dynamics → yields/risk premia → flows into tech/health/defense assets → valuation signals; articulate a base‑case target (e.g., modestly higher growth with sustainable debt servicing) and clearly defined watch list signals (policy votes, debt trajectory thresholds, AI‑driven productivity metrics, HeartSciences FDA/insurance milestones, Pacaso/mogul fundraising flows, UAS job data) with confidence level stated as a single qualifier (e.g., moderate) (EPJYXB7DX UPV3X2MQ6 ILYC1M41F FOM34PUWA V8TEZOR8R).",
