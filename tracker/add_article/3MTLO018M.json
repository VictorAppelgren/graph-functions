      "title": "Trump may want you to pay a high tariff for that French wine you enjoy so much. He just left the category blank in his deal sheet with the EU",
      "summary": "The United States and the European Union reached a trade framework that imposes a 15% tariff on most EU goods exported to the U.S., while exempting certain strategic products such as aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals, and some chemicals. The deal also includes non‑binding commitments for the EU to purchase $750 billion of U.S. energy and for U.S. companies to invest $600 billion in the EU, and it restores lower tariffs on U.S. cars that had been hit by a 27.5% duty. Although the 15% rate is higher than pre‑Trump tariffs, it is far lower than the 30% or 50% rates that were threatened, and the agreement aims to prevent a broader trade war while leaving room for further negotiations on excluded categories like wine, spirits, and steel. Meanwhile, the U.S. has imposed a wide range of new tariffs on dozens of countries, raising the average import duty to the highest level since 1933 and prompting concerns about higher consumer prices and economic efficiency.",
