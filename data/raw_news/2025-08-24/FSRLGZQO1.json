  "title": "Forget About Palantir's $10 Billion Army Contract. This News Is Much Bigger.",
  "description": "RTX scored a contract 5x as big as Palantir's biggest win ever. But is RTX stock cheap enough to buy?",
  "content": "\u2022 The U.S. Pentagon awarded Palantir $10 billion last month.\n\u2022 On that same day, it awarded RTX $50 billion -- 5x as much money.\n\u2022 RTX has been hired to keep Patriot missiles in supply and in service for the next 20 years.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than RTX \u203a\n\nBy now, you've probably heard the news: Last month, rising defense technology star Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) won a $10 billion contract from the U.S. Army, consolidating 75 separate, smaller contracts into a single award, guaranteeing Palantir about $1 billion in annual revenue for the next 10 years.\n\nThis was big news for Palantir, to be sure. It's almost certainly part of the reason why Palantir stock is up $20 so far this month, adding $45 billion to its market capitalization.\n\nBut Palantir's $10 billion contract win wasn't the biggest award the U.S. Pentagon handed out on Aug. 1. Not even close.\n\nLost in all the talk about Palantir's massive contract win earlier this month was an even bigger contract awarded to one of the defense contracting companies that Palantir is trying to supplant: RTX (NYSE: RTX), the company formerly known as Raytheon.\n\nOn Aug. 1, the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) announced, as just one of several contracts awarded by the Pentagon that day, a gigantic $50 billion contract awarded to RTX -- 5x the size of Palantir's win. This \"umbrella\" contract, said the Defense Department, encompasses \"RTX systems and end-item production, spare parts, services, and other types of support.\"\n\nSupport for what, you may ask? Well, DoD didn't say it straight out in its official announcement exactly. But digging around for other sources discussing the same award, I quickly found the answer: Ordering on behalf of the Army, the DLA has secured RTX support for its Patriot air defense systems for the next 20 years.\n\nGovConWire.com, for example, specifically describes the RTX award as a \"$50B umbrella contract for Patriot missiles.\" It further makes clear that the contract will run for an almost unprecedented 20-year term, and is not dependent upon renewal of \"option periods.\"\n\nGranted, to be 100% accurate, one must note that the \"$50 billion\" value is described as the \"maximum\" value the contract might reach. Still, assuming the Army does max out its allotted funds, that works out to $2.5 billion in annual Patriot revenue for RTX, every year, for the next 20 years.\n\nHow much is $2.5 billion worth?\n\nAll this being said, context is important -- especially for investors contemplating an investment in RTX stock.",

      "text": "Defense companies get the bulk of their revenue from one customer -- the U.S. government. Fortunately, that customer has deep pockets and a long history of paying its bills. The federal government\u2019s stability gives defense companies and investors some predictability when it comes to managing cash and projecting growth.\nCompanies in the defense sector offer a wide range of products and services to their main customer, and some are better investments than others. Here's what you need to know about investing in the defense sector and how to pick where your money should go.\nTop defense stocks\nTop 8 defense stocks to buy in 2025\n| Company | Defense Focus |\n|---|---|\n| Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) | Aviation, space, missiles. |\n| Boeing (NYSE:BA) | Aircraft, space, helicopters. |\n| Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) | Nuclear efforts, bombers, space. |\n| General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) | Shipbuilding, defense IT, tanks. |\n| RTX (NYSE:RTX) | Electronics, missiles, aerospace components. |\n| Leidos Holdings (NYSE:LDOS) | Defense IT, space. |\n| L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) | Space, electronics, communications equipment |\n| AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) | Drones, space. |\nLet's look closer at these standout companies.\nCompanies #1-3\n1. Lockheed Martin\nLockheed Martin is the world's largest defense company and the U.S. government's biggest contractor. It's also the lead contractor on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the world's most expensive airplane.\nLockheed's legendary Skunk Works research facility in California is world-renowned. The company has leveraged its research muscle to become a leader in advanced fighter planes, high-tech missiles, and cutting-edge electronics.\n2. Boeing\nBoeing is best known for its commercial airplanes, but its defense business -- although accounting for just one-third of total company revenue -- is large enough to rank among the industry's titans. Boeing makes several aircraft and helicopters for the Pentagon and is involved in space pursuits. The company's defense business has also branched out into autonomous submarines and other products.\nBoeing has been a tough stock to own over the past year due to issues stemming from its commercial side, but the company remains an important vendor to the U.S. government. If the company can successfully work through the operational troubles that have plagued it, there is a lot of upside potential for the stock.\n3. Northrop Grumman\nNorthrop Grumman is responsible for stealth bombers and has a large space portfolio. The company is closely tied to the nuclear triad -- a combination of nuclear missiles, bombers, and submarines able to strike back if the nation is attacked.\nNorthrop is the second-largest standalone defense contractor, and in years past would sometimes be overlooked in favor of Lockheed Martin. But Northrop Grumman's portfolio is more closely tied to key Pentagon priorities, including the triad, making it a good option for investors seeking predictable growth in the years to come.\nCompanies #4-8\n4. General Dynamics\nGeneral Dynamics is one of two primary military shipbuilders and has a portfolio of tanks and land vehicles, making it one of the go-to vendors for the U.S. Army. General Dynamics also has one of the largest defense-focused IT and services businesses, giving it some revenue stability at times when the Pentagon cuts back on equipment purchases.\nShip construction is complex, and individual vessels can take years to complete, creating some quarter-to-quarter revenue inconsistency. General Dynamics tries to offset that choppiness via its more-predictable IT business, but investors should be aware that the mix of businesses can make it difficult to predict quarterly results.\n5. RTX\nRTX, formerly Raytheon Technologies, doesn't make warships or fighters. However, it does have a role in a wide range of important military platforms led by other contractors. It is the product of the 2020 merger between Raytheon, a defense electronics and missile specialist, and United Technologies, which makes aircraft engines and various other aerospace parts.\nThe Pentagon has expended some of its stockpile of weapons in recent years, which should lead to significant demand for missiles and other RTX goods in the years to come. The company also gets some upside from its commercial business, which has enjoyed a multiyear cycle of strong demand for spare parts to keep the existing aviation fleet aloft.\n6. Leidos Holdings\nLeidos Holdings is the largest government information technology (IT) company. It has also actively expanded into hardware, providing the electronics and brains for autonomous ships and building a strong portfolio of classified research capabilities geared for the intelligence and space communities.\nThe push to make government more efficient comes with both risks and rewards for these IT companies. Leidos and other IT companies specialize in providing services that were once done in-house at a lower cost, which could create opportunities. But government watchdogs aiming to cut overall costs will be looking closely at these contracts for ways to save.\n7. L3Harris Technologies\nL3Harris Technologies was formed from the 2019 merger of Harris Corp. and L3 Technologies. Both were defense-electronics and sensor suppliers that hoped to use their combined scale to better-compete against the bigger contractors for prime positions on defense contracts.\nThe company has spent most of the decade streamlining its portfolio and investing in new technologies. Today, it is a major vendor of tactical communications and reconnaissance systems, night-vision equipment, and complex space sensors as well as other defense electronics products.\n8. AeroVironment\nAeroVironment is a leader in drones, developing a sophisticated line of small- and medium-sized aircraft that have proven to be invaluable in the war in Ukraine. That conflict has been a proof-of-concept for AeroVironment, getting the company on the radar screen of military buyers at the Pentagon and with U.S. allies.\nAeroVironment is still early in its growth cycle. In early 2025, the company acquired BlueHalo to increase its presence in the market for larger drones as well as autonomous water systems and space technology.\nDefense ETFs\nDefense ETFs\nIf you are bullish on defense but would rather not choose among individual companies, you can buy shares in one or more exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that cover the sector. These are three of the largest ETFs that are focused on defense:\n- Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF (PPA 0.8%)\n- SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR 1.3%)\n- iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA 0.44%)\nElectronic defense\nDefense goes electric\nFor most of its history, the defense industry's primary expertise was metal-bending. Only a few companies on Earth could build massive battleships, bombers, and tanks.\nBut in this sector, as in the rest of the world, value is increasingly going not to the companies forging the steel but to the ones providing the brains that go inside it. Defense electronics and cybersecurity are growing portions of almost every company's portfolio. It's where a lot of the internal investment is going right now.\nDefense IT also remains a priority, with vendors scrambling to provide the Pentagon with secure networks and data-rich communications systems.\nEffect of conflict\nWill conflict move defense stocks?\nNightly headlines highlight global unrest, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and recurring questions about stability in the Middle East. Defense stocks tend to move higher at the onset of a new conflict but rarely sustain those gains. Investors should understand that defense projects tend to have multiyear timetables that don't lend themselves to a quick revenue surge, even when demand is on the upswing.\nLarge defense contractors generate much better margins on research and development (R&D) into new advanced weapons systems than from selling one-off missiles or ammunition. If the U.S. government were to deemphasize research to fund active operations, the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East could hurt defense stocks. However, given the importance of research, that seems unlikely.\nLonger term, the impact could be more substantial. These conflicts are likely to add to defense sales in the years to come through the replenishment of weapons sent to Ukraine and Israel and as U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere look to strengthen their military muscle.\nInvesting in defense\nInvesting in defense companies\nThe defense sector is more than just weapons used on land, sea, and air. It's defined more broadly as companies primarily catering to the Pentagon or other government agencies.\nThe list includes weapons makers but also service companies that run IT networks, manage inventories, and perform other tasks for government agencies. Defense company strengths include:\n- The ability to navigate the Byzantine government procurement process and have thousands of employees with the security clearances necessary to do defense work\n- Predictable revenues driven largely by the government's annual provision of a five-year outlook of planned purchases\n- Healthy dividend payouts, due in part to some defense companies' R&D being funded by the government -- freeing up cash that can be returned to shareholders\nFinding the best\nHow to find the best defense stocks\nThe defense sector tends to be a stable group of companies with a few failures and a few standouts. Here are some tips for evaluating individual defense companies.\nListen to the customer\nThe Pentagon has an insatiable appetite for new equipment. But with aircraft carriers costing more than $10 billion and F-35 fighters priced at $100 million or more, the government can only buy so much. To figure out the likely winners and losers, pay attention to the budgeting process.\nEarly in the year, the Pentagon sends a funding request to Congress, which then holds hearings to discuss priorities and make final allocation choices throughout the spring and into the summer. An investor need not hang on every word. However, the budget request, available on the Pentagon's website, and commentary elsewhere can provide clues about which billion-dollar programs are administration priorities.\nFollow the numbers\nCompanies often highlight massive contract awards in press releases without explaining that those big-dollar figures are often spread out over many years and may depend on Congress approving the funds. Pay attention to these metrics when evaluating defense stocks:\n- Free cash flow: This is important for any business, but free cash flow can vary for defense contractors based on whether their projects are new or well established. Companies often spend more in the early stages of a production contract, temporarily depressing cash flow.\n- Corporate backlogs: Investors should pay close attention to corporate backlogs, which are future contracts that have been awarded but not yet executed. How much of a backlog has been funded and how much must go through the congressional budgeting process can vary greatly.\n- Book-to-bill ratio: This metric compares the value of orders received in a given quarter to the amount billed and indicates a company's growth potential. A growing company should have a book-to-bill ratio of at least 1.0, implying that orders for future products are being booked at a rate that equals or exceeds what is being shipped today.\nDefense companies know investors are focused on these metrics and typically provide the relevant information in quarterly earnings reports or conference calls.\nRelated investing topics\nThe bottom line\nAre defense stocks right for your portfolio?\nDefense companies manufacture lethal products and can be involved in supporting operations or intelligence-gathering that some find unsettling. Some investors don't want to support those activities and may want to avoid becoming shareholders of defense stocks.\nLike many industrials, defense stocks tend to be more plodding than high-flying technology or biotech stocks. But that also means they are less volatile than some sectors. Defense stocks are best suited for income-oriented investors seeking steady growth and rising dividends rather than immense valuation increases.\nFAQs\nBest defense stocks: FAQs\nWhat is the top defense stock?\nLockheed Martin is both the largest pure-play defense company and the one with the most revenue diversity in terms of exposure to different agencies and platforms. Although it doesn't always outperform in the near term, it is the top choice among defense stocks for long-term-focused investors.\nAre defense stocks a good buy?\nDefense stock valuations tend to be tied to government spending, which can mean periods of underperformance. However, over the long run, defense stocks offer growth rates higher than inflation and steady dividend income, making them a solid choice for investors seeking stability and income in their portfolios.\nDo defense stocks rise during war?\nDefense stocks tend to jump higher on headlines of a new military conflict but give up some of those gains in the following months. Even if a conflict creates a higher demand for defense equipment, orders take time to materialize and even longer to fulfill. For that reason, military conflict is not typically an immediate boost to results.\nWhat are the most undervalued defense stocks?\nLeidos Holdings is the most undervalued among the major defense stocks with a P/E ratio of 16. Defense IT specialists tend to trade at a discount to some of the more diversified contractors.\nWhich defense stocks pay dividends?\nMost established defense companies, with the exception of Boeing, pay dividends, and Boeing will likely seek to pay a dividend again in the future. Among defense stocks, Lockheed Martin currently pays the highest dividend with a 2.8% yield.\nWho is the biggest defense contractor?\nLockheed Martin is the biggest defense contractor in terms of defense-specific revenue, but both Boeing and RTX have larger market caps thanks to their presence in both defense and commercial aerospace.\nWhat is the most profitable defense company?\nLeidos Holdings is the most profitable company in this group, as measured by operating margin. Defense IT-focused companies have a different cost profile including insignificant raw material costs, helping them to boost margins."

      "text": "When you follow the U.S. Pentagon's daily digest of contract awards as regularly as I do, things sometimes tend to blend together. Don't get me wrong -- $1 billion here, $1 billion there, and it eventually becomes clear that the government is spending \"real money\" on military hardware. Still, most of the contracts described on the Pentagon's website tend to be much smaller in size -- $10 million here, a few tens of millions there.\nAll of which I tell you by way of illustrating that when all of a sudden, the U.S. Army announced last month that it's awarding a $10 billion contract to defense contracting upstart Palantir (PLTR 1.60%), that made me sit up and take notice.\nPalantir's big payday\nThis contract, announced on July 31, is the biggest single award I've ever seen handed to Palantir, and almost 10 times bigger than the Maven Smart System contract it won from the U.S. Army in May.\nAnd yet it's perhaps not quite as big as it seems.\nAs described on the Pentagon website, the $10 billion award \"transition[s] existing contracts in which Palantir is currently a prime or subcontractor to [a new] enterprise agreement\" worth $10 billion. This means the award doesn't really give Palantir $10 billion worth of new work to do for the Army. Rather, a substantial amount of the award (and perhaps even all of it), comprises dozens of existing contracts, already won by the defense company, now bundled up into one megasized $10 billion deal to provide artificial intelligence (AI) software and data services to the U.S. Army.\nWhat's more, the $10 billion value is spread across 10 years. All of which is to say that Palantir's \"$10 billion contract\" is really worth only about $1 billion a year -- and much or all of that $1 billion was already destined for Palantir's wallet anyway.\nHow much is $1 billion worth?\nNow, let's try to put these numbers in context for you.\nOne billion dollars may not be as big a number as $10 billion, but it's still pretty big. Palantir generated $3.4 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. So a $1 billion Army contract amounts to about 29% of the revenue Palantir collected over the last 12 months -- a very big deal if this were additional incremental revenue added to the company's revenue stream.\nIt's less of a big deal, however, if all the Army is doing here is gluing together 75 smaller, existing contracts into one super-big agreement.\nA second consideration is how valuable this revenue is to Palantir, which is to say, what kind of profit margin the company will earn on its $1 billion a year. The good news here is that Palantir's software-centric profit margins are robust, and getting even more so over time.\nIn 2023 for example, Palantir earned a 5.4% operating profit margin on its revenue. In 2024, that number doubled to 10.8%. This year, it's grown even more, to about 23.3%.\nThat's the good news. The better news is that the new $10 billion mega-contract \"removes contract-related fees,\" according to the Army. And this logically implies that it's removing cost from the contract, potentially permitting Palantir's profit margin to expand even further.\nIs Palantir stock a buy?\nAt least, Palantir investors had better hope this is the case. Palantir is generating giant revenue from the U.S. military; no one disputes that. Its revenue is also growing, roughly doubling in size since 2021, whether or not this particular $10 billion contract adds to that growth.\nHowever, none of this changes the fact that Palantir is a frighteningly expensive stock, and that it absolutely must continue to both grow its revenue and expand its profit margin in order to justify its valuation.\nPriced at an astounding 573 times trailing earnings, or an only slightly less alarming 255 times free cash flow, Palantir probably needs to be growing earnings somewhere in the low triple-digit percentage range to justify its current stock price -- yet according to S&P Global data, most analysts project no more than a 40% long-term earnings growth rate for the stock.\nSad as it is to say, even with a $10 billion Army contract in hand, Palantir stock costs too much to buy."

  "argos_summary": "The U.S. Pentagon awarded Palantir a $10\u202fbillion contract that bundles existing Army contracts, effectively delivering about $1\u202fbillion in annual revenue over ten years. On the same day, RTX received a $50\u202fbillion \u201cumbrella\u201d contract for Patriot missile support, a five\u2011fold larger award that spans 20 years and could generate roughly $2.5\u202fbillion per year. The article explains that Palantir\u2019s deal is largely a re\u2011organization of prior work, while RTX\u2019s contract secures long\u2011term supply and maintenance for a key U.S. air\u2011defense system. It also situates these awards within broader defense\u2011sector investment considerations, noting the stability and predictability of government contracts for defense firms.",
