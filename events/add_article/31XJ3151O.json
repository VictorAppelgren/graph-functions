      "summary": "A police report on the August 5 crash in Anderson, involving a stolen 2006 Ford F250, found no clear driver among its three occupants. The vehicle, pursued by Alexandria officers for suspected drunken and reckless driving, was traveling the wrong way at high speed, crashed into two buildings, and overturned, killing 20‑year‑old Preston Jett and 17‑year‑old Landon Shaffer while 16‑year‑old Dalton Jett survived the crash. The chase ended about 12 miles from its start, and investigators remain uncertain who was driving at the time of the collision.",
