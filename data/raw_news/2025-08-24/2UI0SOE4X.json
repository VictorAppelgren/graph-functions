  "content": "Novak Djokovic delivered a lesson in grand slam tenacity to Learner Tien in the first round of the US Open, battling past the American teenager 6-1, 7-6 (3), 6-2 to launch his latest quest for a record 25th major title.\n\nCompeting in his first singles match since his run to the Wimbledon semi-finals last month, the 38-year-old Serb swapped the whites for a sleek all-black outfit and managed physical issues to prevail under the Arthur Ashe Stadium lights.\n\nDjokovic, seeded seventh, shrugged off a time violation to consolidate an early break at the start of the contest and a heated debate with the chair umpire shortly afterwards only spurred him on to wrap up the opening set in double quick time.\n\nThe 19-year-old Tien, on a near-impossible mission to hand Djokovic his first opening-round loss at a grand slam since the 2006 Australian Open, had his chances to draw level during a draining second set but crumbled in the tiebreak.\n\nAfter treatment for a nasty right foot blister, Djokovic produced some heavy groundstrokes from the baseline to break for a 3-1 lead in the third set and the four-times New York champion never looked back from there.",

      "text": "Four years after her three life-changing weeks in New York, Emma Raducanu overcame a significant mental hurdle as she secured her first victory at the US Open since her 2021 title run in impressive fashion, dismantling the qualifier Ena Shibahara 6-1, 6-2 to finally return to the second round.\nAfter painful first-round defeats by Aliz\u00e9 Cornet and Sofia Kenin, plus a withdrawal in 2023 during an eight-month injury layoff, Raducanu showed her growth and newfound self-assurance by putting together a solid, clean performance against an inferior opponent.\n\u201cIt has been on my mind,\u201d Raducanu said of her inability to win a match in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s been four years, and it\u2019s a very special tournament for me. I did feel different coming into it this year. I felt like I was doing the right things day to day, but still, it\u2019s in the back of your head. So I\u2019m just very pleased to have overcome that.\u201d\nWith the victory, the British No 1 is now 20-4 against lower-ranked players over the past year and her ability to consistently win favourable match-ups has been a key part of her steady rise up the rankings. She will next face the qualifier Janice Tjen, who toppled the 24th seed Veronika Kudermetova 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.\nIt also signified a confidence-building first grand slam victory alongside her new Spanish coach, Francisco Roig, who again offered his charge a constant stream of positive reinforcement from a corner of Louis Armstrong Stadium. Roig was joined in Raducanu\u2019s player box by Jerome Poupel, a chiropractor who has been helping Raducanu with her continued back injury.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been helping me for the last year, I would say. I\u2019ve had back problems for the last year, so he\u2019s just really helped with that,\u201d Raducanu said.\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve been playing more tennis and training more, it\u2019s just important for me to stay on top of that. It\u2019s cool, you know, he\u2019s worked in F1, he\u2019s worked with horses, so it\u2019s very different. But I\u2019m just enjoying having him around. He\u2019s a great, calm but eccentric kind of character.\u201d\nDuring their time working together, Poupel has offered Raducanu unique insights on her character. \u201cHe said that my character is similar to a horse,\u201d she said. \u201cCan be quite stubborn, dig their heels in. He\u2019s got experience. Hopefully he can read me. And also they kind of wear their emotion on their sleeve.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re not feeling like they want to do something they probably won\u2019t do it. I\u2019m just happy to have him around. He\u2019s got so much different, diverse experience that it\u2019s great to have that insight.\u201d\nThis was a good first-round draw for Raducanu, but Shibahara is an interesting figure in her own right. An American-born Japanese player, the 27-year-old is a former top four doubles player and the 2022 French Open mixed doubles champion. Shibahara only opted to prioritise singles last year and she has performed admirably, rising from outside the top 500 to her current ranking of No 128. However, she has never defeated a top-50 opponent and this contest marked just the second grand slam main draw appearance of her career.\nFrom the beginning, Raducanu set the tone with a calming hold to love. As she rolled through the match, she found a nice balance between imposing herself with her early ball striking and remaining solid against an erratic opponent who finished the match with 36 unforced errors. While Raducanu once spent a significant amount of time scouting opponents, she puts part of her success down to finding solutions within herself.\n\u201cI like watching the opponents,\u201d Raducanu said. \u201cI think I\u2019m probably watching less now. I just have a good awareness of the opponent, what they like to do, and a lot more centred around me. I think I\u2019m trusting myself, trusting my own abilities a lot more and I know what I need to do on the court as well, not necessarily searching so much to the box, asking for what to do, only if I feel like I really need it. I think that\u2019s helped me keep my head in the match, rather than looking up, getting distracted, and kind of searching for something.\u201d\nBefore the tournament, Raducanu spoke in depth about how the US Open has generated conflicting emotions for her over the years. Her first\u2011round defeat against Kenin last year was a particularly low point, and Raducanu broke down in tears during her post-match press conference.\nThings are clearly different now. This summer Raducanu has become a more match tough and confident player than at any point in the past four years. Now she will try to turn that conviction and contentment into another positive run in New York.\nComments (\u2026)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"
