  "description": "August is the month when the world shuts down and the chess scene heats up.",
  "content": "August is the month when the world shuts down and the chess scene heats up.\n\nThe DMV was host to two major events last month \u2014 the Maryland Chess Association\u2019s 12th Washington International and the 57th annual Atlantic Open, organized by the Continental Chess Association. On the national scene, some of the world\u2019s top grandmasters were doing battle last week in the 12th Sinquefield Cup invitational at the St. Louis Chess Club.\n\nThis year\u2019s Washington International attracted one of its strongest fields ever, with 18 grandmasters and dozens of titled players competing in the 114-player Championship section. In the end, Indian GM Rahul Srivatshav Peddi, a member of the powerhouse University of Texas at Dallas collegiate team, claimed the top prize at 7\u00bd-1\u00bd, a half-point clear of GMs Jianchou Zhou and Andrew Tang.\n\nZhou received a measure of compensation two weeks later, tying for first in the Atlantic Open alongside Italian GM Francesco Sonis at 4\u00bd-\u00bd. Here\u2019s a special shout-out to Virginia junior expert Benjamin Amrany, who tied for third in the Atlantic at 4-1, with a loss to Zhou the only blemish on his scorecard.\n\nPeddi broke away from a crowded field in the International with 2\u00bd points in his final games against a trio of grandmasters, starting with a Round 7 demolition of GM David Brodsky. White\u2019s 7. d3 Qd7 8. Qd2 breaks up the symmetry of the Symmetrical English, but it is Brodsky\u2019s determination to attack while ignoring his own king\u2019s safety that seals Black\u2019s fate.\n\nAfter 14. Qxb2 Nce5?! (0-0 was the better option here, even if White\u2019s attacking chances seem remote for now) 15. h3 Nxf3+ 16. exf3 Ne5 17. Kg2 g5? (still charging forward, when 17\u20260-0 was the increasingly necessary alternative; after 17\u20260-0 18. d4 Nc6 19. d5 Nd4 20. Re1, Peddi has the more comfortable game but it\u2019s still a fight) 18. Nd5 Qh5 19. g4! (the greedy 19. Nc7+?! Kd7 20. Nxa8 Qxd3 22. Rae1 Qxf3+ 23. Kh2 h5 22. d4 Ng4+ 23. Kg1 h4 leads a much messier position) Qg6 20. Rfe1 f6 21. d4 cxd4 (Nd3 22. Rxe7+ Kf8 23. Qe2, evades the fork) 22. Qxd4, Black\u2019s decision to delay castling looks ever more wrong-headed. Ironically, both 22\u20260-0?? and 22\u20260-0-0?? now would lose the Black queen to 23. Nxe7+.\n\nPeddi\u2019s 25. fxg4 Qh7? (Rd8 was a tougher defense) 26. Re3! puts a firm halt to Black\u2019s h-file attacking dreams, leaving White to focus all his attention on the beleaguered Black king: 27. Qc3 dxc5 28. Nxe7! (the combinations come naturally when one\u2019s opponent is so tied down) Ne5 (Nxe7 29. Qxf6+ Ke8 [Kg8 30. Qxg5+] 30. Rde1) 29. Nf5 b6 30. Rd6 Qf7 (see diagram) 31. Rxe5!, removing Black\u2019s last effective defender.\n\nIt\u2019s over on 31\u2026fxe5 32. Qxe5 Qb7+ 33. f3 Rh7 34. Rf6+ Kg8 (Rf7 35. Rxb6!, hitting the queen and threatening 36. Qh8 mate) 35. Rg6+ Kf8 36. Qf6+, and Black resigned, not needing to play out such gruesome lines as 36\u2026Ke8 (Qf7 37. Qd6+) Rg8+ Kd7 38. Qd6 mate.\n\nThis year\u2019s Sinquefield Cup hardly rates as one of the best editions of this elite event, with an uncharacteristic lack of fighting spirit among the 10 competitors in St. Louis. Several rounds saw only draws and two players \u2014 GMs Sam Sevian and Maxime Vachier-Legrave \u2014 managed to split the point in all nine of their games.\n\nStill, the final result was a welcome triumph for American GM Wesley So, the U.S. No. 3 who seems to labor at times in the shadows of his more successful American rivals, GMs Fabiano Caruana and Hikaru Nakamura. So tied for first in Sinquefield with an undefeated 5 1/2-3 1/2 score, and then defeated Caruana and Indian GM Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa in a blitz playoff to take home the trophy, his second Sinquefield Cup since winning the event back in 2016.\n\nSo\u2019s best win came in Round 7 against reigning Indian world champion Dommaraju Gukesh. White adroitly turns back Black\u2019s early aggressions in a Ruy Lopez Berlin Defense and efficiently nails down the win in the end.\n\nBlack\u2019s 11. Nd5 Bh4!? is apparently a new move in this trendy line, and a remarkable position arises after 14. gxh4 cxd5 \u2014 two of the planet\u2019s best players find themselves with isolated, doubled pawns and barely any pieces deployed with the middlegame about to commence.\n\nWith 18. Bxd5 Be6!? 19. Bxb7, Gukesh offers a pawn for quicker development, but on 19\u2026Rae8 20. Bc6 Re7?!, the Black rook\u2019s awkward new post seems hardly an improvement. Black\u2019s attempts to justify his sacrifice only lead him deeper into a hole.\n\nThus: 23. Kh1 (the half-open g-file created by the doubled pawns will now prove a valuable asset for So) Qg6 24. Re5!? (a slight inaccuracy, allowing Black a puncher\u2019s chance; more consistent was 24. Bf4 Rd8 25. Ba4!, preserving the extra pawn and the better position) Bc8? (Black\u2019s determination to sacrifice and attack comes back to bite him; tougher was 24\u2026Nh4!, sending the game in a different direction after 25. Qg3 Bg4!? 26. Rxe7 Nf5 Qf4 [Qe5?? Bf3 mate] Nxe7 28. Bb5, and Black can fight on) 25. Bxd5 Rxe5 26. dxe5 Rd8 27. Rg1!, inviting such ugly lines as 27\u2026Qb6 28. c4 Qxb2 29. Bg5 Rf8 30. Bf6 g6 31. Qh3 Be6 32. Rxg6+! fxg6 (hxg6 33. Qh8 mate) 33. Bxe6+ Rf7 34. Bxf7+ Kxf7 35. Qxh7+, winning.\n\nGukesh jettisons his queen with 27\u2026Nh4 28. Qf4 Rxd5 (Qh5 29. Qf6! wins on the spot) 29. Rxg6 Nxg6 30. Qe3 h5, but does not get nearly enough material in return. The rest is professionally handled by So, giving his opponent no counterplay, and on 38. exf6 gxf6 39. Ba5, Black resigned.\n\u2022 Got a hot chess tip or a good game to share? David R. Sands can be reached by email at davidrsands@gmail.com.",
