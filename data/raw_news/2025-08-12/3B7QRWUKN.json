  "content": "FiscalNote Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: NOTE), the leading provider of AI-driven policy and regulatory intelligence solutions, today announced it has closed the previously announced series of transactions to refinance its senior debt and restructure substantially all of its subordinated debt. The closed transactions provide the Company with a clear, long-term runway and increased operating flexibility as it executes its product-led growth strategy.\n\nIn light of the timing of these transactions, there are a few customary, additional disclosures required in the Company\u2019s Q2 2025 Form 10-Q filing. Accordingly, the Company plans to file a Form 12b-25 to extend the filing deadline for the Form 10-Q to August 18, enabling time to finalize the additional disclosures.\n\nCertain statements in this press release may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or FiscalNote\u2019s future financial or operating performance. For example, statements regarding FiscalNote\u2019s financial outlook for future periods, expectations regarding profitability, capital resources and anticipated growth in the industry in which FiscalNote operates are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as \u201cpro forma,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cmight,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cpossible,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cstrive,\u201d \u201cbudget,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cpredict,\u201d \u201cpotential\u201d or \u201ccontinue,\u201d or the negatives of these terms or variations of them or similar terminology. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.\n\nFactors that may impact such forward-looking statements include:\n\u2022 concentration of revenues from U.S. government agencies, changes in the U.S. government spending priorities, dependence on winning or renewing U.S. government contracts, delay, disruption or unavailability of funding on U.S. government contracts, and the U.S. government\u2019s right to modify, delay, curtail or terminate contracts;\n\u2022 FiscalNote\u2019s ability to successfully execute on its strategy to achieve and sustain organic growth through a focus on its core Policy business, including risks to FiscalNote\u2019s ability to develop, enhance, and integrate its existing platforms, products, and services, bring highly useful, reliable, secure and innovative products, product features and services to market, attract new customers, retain existing customers, expand its products and service offerings with existing customers, expand into geographic markets or identify other opportunities for growth;\n\u2022 FiscalNote\u2019s future capital requirements, as well as its ability to service its repayment obligations and maintain compliance with covenants and restrictions under its existing debt agreements;\n\u2022 demand for FiscalNote\u2019s services and the drivers of that demand;\n\u2022 the impact of cost reduction initiatives undertaken by FiscalNote;\n\u2022 risks associated with international operations, including compliance complexity and costs, increased exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, political, social and economic instability, and supply chain disruptions;\n\u2022 FiscalNote\u2019s ability to introduce new features, integrations, capabilities, and enhancements to its products and services, as well as obtain and maintain accurate, comprehensive, or reliable data to support its products and services;\n\u2022 FiscalNote's reliance on third-party systems and data, its ability to integrate such systems and data with its solutions and its potential inability to continue to support integration;\n\u2022 FiscalNote\u2019s ability to maintain and improve its methods and technologies, and anticipate new methods or technologies, for data collection, organization, and analysis to support its products and services;\n\u2022 potential technical disruptions, cyberattacks, security, privacy or data breaches or other technical or security incidents that affect FiscalNote\u2019s networks or systems or those of its service providers;\n\u2022 competition and competitive pressures in the markets in which FiscalNote operates, including larger well-funded companies shifting their existing business models to become more competitive with FiscalNote;\n\u2022 FiscalNote\u2019s ability to comply with laws and regulations in connection with selling products and services to U.S. and foreign governments and other highly regulated industries;\n\u2022 FiscalNote\u2019s ability to adapt its products and services for changes in laws and regulations or public perception, or changes in the enforcement of such laws, relating to artificial intelligence, machine learning, data privacy and government contracts;\n\u2022 adverse general economic and market conditions reducing spending on our products and services;\n\u2022 the outcome of any known and unknown litigation and regulatory proceedings;\n\u2022 FiscalNote\u2019s ability to maintain public company-quality internal control over financial reporting; and\n\u2022 FiscalNote\u2019s ability to protect and maintain its brands and other intellectual property rights.\n\nThese and other important factors discussed in FiscalNote\u2019s SEC filings, including its most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, particularly the \"Risk Factors\" sections of those reports, could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements made in this press release. These forward-looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by FiscalNote and its management, are inherently uncertain. Nothing in this press release should be regarded as a representation by any person that the forward-looking statements set forth herein will be achieved or that any of the contemplated results of such forward-looking statements will be achieved. You should not place reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.
