      "title": "European postal services suspend shipment of packages to U.S. over import tariffs",
      "summary": "The U.S. is set to end the de‑minimis duty‑free exemption for packages under $800, prompting European postal operators—including Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, France, Austria, the UK, and others—to suspend shipments to the United States pending clarification on new tariff rules. The change follows a trade framework that imposes a 15% tariff on most EU goods and extends duties to low‑value parcels, raising uncertainty about customs data transmission and duty collection. While the U.S. administration delays the start date of broader tariffs to August 7, the pause reflects confusion over which goods are covered and how duties will be enforced. Postal services warn that without clear guidance, shipments may be delayed or face additional charges, and some operators have already halted commercial deliveries to the U.S. as of late August. The move underscores the broader tension between U.S. trade policy and European logistics providers amid ongoing tariff negotiations.",
