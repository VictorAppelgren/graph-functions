As you come upon the home stretch of your life in the office, you\u2019re starting to think about what you\u2019d like your time off the clock to look like.\n\nCheck Out: 4 Retirement Expenses Boomers Didn\u2019t Plan for \u2014 but Should Have\n\nRead Next: 7 Ways To Tell If You're Rich or Middle Class -- It's More Than Your Paycheck\n\nHaving a good time in retirement can be a little easier if you\u2019re around people you adore, whether they\u2019re your friends and family (even that son-in-law you\u2019ve come to love begrudgingly). But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make like Mary Tyler Moore and make it on your own. Because even with others around, if you\u2019re living solo, you\u2019ll have a lot of time to yourself. With some careful budgeting, you can have a high flying and fun retirement even on your lonesome.\n\nNow that you have all the time in the world, you figure why not start a new hobby. None of the conventional hobbies, like joining a walking club or taking up canasta, are sparking joy these days. Where do you turn for inspiration? Try a subscription box. Using a service like Cratejoy, you could pick any number of subscription boxes that might bring a new hobby to your doorstep every month.\n\nThe Adults & Crafts box comes with craft projects for grown-ups, complete with tools, materials and instructions you need to complete the project of the month. You also have the option of requesting any of the more than 50+ available crafts at any time. To try a box and see if you\u2019d like it, you can get a one-month option for $36 a box. It runs $35 per box for a three-month subscription, as well as $34 and $33 a month for six and 12 months, respectively.\n\nThere are other options for cocktail lovers, people who want to collect crystals and even folks who want to get into tinned fish. Truly, there\u2019s a hobby for everyone. You just need to open the right box.\n\nBe Aware: 6 Key Signs You\u2019ll Run Out of Retirement Funds Too Early\n\nOne of the biggest perks of retirement life is the freedom to travel. But planning a trip \u2014 especially an international trip \u2014 solo can feel daunting. The beauty of group travel packages is that they give you the pleasure, and security, of fellow travelers and guides who know their way around the terrain.\n\nYou certainly don\u2019t lack group travel options, including packages especially for seniors. The renowned travel company EF Go Ahead Tours hosts national and international tours geared toward seniors, such as a 10-day jaunt to London for prices that average between $2,400 and $3,000 (of course, prices may vary on the time and destination). You also get the benefit of picking tours geared toward people who prefer a more leisurely pace instead of high-octane ways of stamping their passports.\n\nGetting active in your senior years can help you stay mobile and independent for as long as possible, which is even more important when you live alone. Working out at a gym can give you access to personal trainers who can develop a wellness plan especially for you, as well as group classes like yoga, water fitness or Zumba \u2014 where you can meet some friends and motivation partners.\n\nSome popular gyms like Planet Fitness offer relatively low membership costs, like $10 a month with an annual $49 fee. However, if the prospect of a trendy gym is intimidating, you can always try the YMCA, which is known for including people of all backgrounds. Membership prices may vary depending on your region, but you can expect your monthly fee to hover between $60 and $70 or so, plus joiner fees.\n\nYour home may be your castle, but sometimes you have to explore new terrain \u2014 even if it\u2019s only the local senior center. Instead of whiling away your time in front of that new Netflix docuseries, you could be making new friends over a board game, participating in an educational program or art class, or even attending a dance (bet you thought those ended after high school).\n\nWhen you\u2019re creating your retirement budget, you should factor in senior center membership fees every year, month or for a set period of time. Now, some senior centers are free for people over a certain age; others, however, do require you to pay for membership, and the prices and payment structures vary significantly. Investigate the senior centers near you to learn more about their costs, and to see if they have programs you\u2019d enjoy.\n\u2022 None 3 Luxury SUVs That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Summer 2025\n\u2022 None I Paid Off $40,000 in 7 Months Doing These 5 Things\n\u2022 None Mark Cuban Tells Americans To Stock Up on Consumables as Trump's Tariffs Hit -- Here's What To Buy\n\u2022 None 25 Places To Buy a Home If You Want It To Gain Value\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 4 Expenses Boomers Should Plan For in Retirement If They\u2019ll Be Retiring Solo",

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nQuestion #8 of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts Series\nWhat\u2019s the best way to save money on everyday purchases?\nMichelle Schroeder-Gardner knows something about making dramatic financial changes. The founder of Making Sense of Cents paid off nearly $40,000 in student loans in just seven months, then left her corporate job to travel full time in an RV and sailboat for nearly a decade. But her biggest money-saving insights don\u2019t come from major lifestyle overhauls. They come from small, everyday tweaks that most people overlook.\n\u201cOne of the best ways I\u2019ve found to save money on everyday purchases is by being intentional,\u201d Schroeder-Gardner shared. \u201cThat means making a list before you go to the grocery store, planning your meals to avoid food waste and comparing prices before buying.\u201d\nAfter more than 13 years of helping millions of readers through her award-winning blog, she\u2019s identified three key strategies that can help almost anyone save hundreds of dollars each month \u2014 without feeling deprived.\nSmall Changes, Big Impact\nWhen asked about everyday habits that created substantial savings, Schroeder-Gardner points to one game-changer: meal planning.\n\u201cMeal prepping and meal planning has easily saved us hundreds of dollars each month,\u201d she said. \u201cWe used to rely a lot on takeout or pre-packaged meals, especially on busy days, but the costs really added up.\u201d\nHer approach isn\u2019t about magically becoming a gourmet chef or spending hours in the kitchen. Instead, she focuses on simple systems: \u201cI batch cook some staples, freeze leftovers and always have a few \u2018lazy meals\u2019 ready for nights when we don\u2019t feel like cooking. It doesn\u2019t have to be complicated \u2014 just having a plan makes a big difference.\u201d\nThe results speak for themselves. \u201cWe\u2019ve easily saved over $300 a month by skipping convenience meals,\u201d Schroeder-Gardner said. For a family spending $400-500 monthly on food, that represents a 60% to 75% reduction in food costs just from planning ahead.\nHer secret? Treating meal planning like any other important task. \u201cOnce I started planning simple meals for the week and prepping ingredients ahead of time, our grocery spending dropped and we stopped wasting so much food.\u201d\nThe Invisible Money Drains\nWhile most people focus on obvious expenses like coffee or lunch out, Schroeder-Gardner warns about \u201cinvisible expenses\u201d that quietly drain budgets.\n\u201cSubscriptions are a big one,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget about the streaming service you signed up for during a free trial, or that annual renewal you didn\u2019t notice on your credit card.\u201d\nHer solution is refreshingly simple: monthly financial check-ins. \u201cI recommend going through your bank or credit card statements once a month and asking yourself: \u2018Did I actually use this?\u2019 If the answer is no, cancel it.\u201d\nBut the most costly invisible expense might surprise you: interest on debt. \u201cIf you\u2019re carrying a balance, it can eat away at your budget and cost a lot of money over time,\u201d Schroeder-Gardner said. While not exactly \u201cinvisible,\u201d debt interest often gets overlooked in monthly budgeting because it feels fixed \u2014 but addressing it can free up real money for other goals.\nWhen You Think You\u2019ve Cut Everything\nFor people who feel they\u2019ve already trimmed every possible expense, Schroeder-Gardner suggests looking beyond line-item cuts to bigger-picture strategies.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve already cut the obvious stuff, I\u2019d look at the bigger-picture expenses,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you have a good budget in place? Are you meal planning to avoid food waste? Could you refinance a loan or negotiate a lower internet or phone bill?\u201d\nShe also recommends trying a \u201cno-spend challenge\u201d for a week or month. \u201cIt can reset your habits and help you see spending patterns you may have missed.\u201d\nAnd here\u2019s where Schroeder-Gardner\u2019s advice gets especially interesting: Sometimes the answer isn\u2019t cutting more \u2014 it\u2019s earning more.\n\u201cIf you feel like you have nothing to cut, then you may want to look into making more money,\u201d she said. \u201cBack when I was paying off my student loans, I cut my budget as much as I could, but then I realized that I had to find ways to make more money. I was able to pay off $40,000 in student loans in just 7 months \u2014 mainly with side hustle income.\u201d\nWhether it\u2019s positioning yourself for a promotion at work, freelancing in your spare time, or launching a small business, increasing your income can create the financial breathing room you\u2019ve been looking for.\nThe Technology Advantage\nSchroeder-Gardner also leverages technology to maximize savings with minimal effort. \u201cI like using cashback apps, grocery receipt scanning apps like Fetch Rewards and browser extensions to stack savings. These little steps don\u2019t take much time, but they can add up over the course of a month.\u201d\nThe key is stacking multiple small savings rather than relying on any single strategy. A cashback app might save $5, a browser extension another $10 and meal planning $300 \u2014 but together, they can create meaningful monthly savings.\nThe Mindset Shift\nPerhaps most importantly, Schroeder-Gardner emphasizes that sustainable money-saving starts with changing how you think about money.\n\u201cThe turning point for me was realizing that I didn\u2019t have to wait until retirement to live the life I truly wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter paying off my student loans, I left my 8-to-5 job, started working for myself, and spent around a decade traveling full-time by RV and sailboat \u2014 all while growing a business I loved.\u201d\nThis perspective shift \u2014 from restricting spending to being intentional about money \u2014 is what makes the difference between feeling deprived and feeling empowered.\nHer advice boils down to three core principles: Plan ahead (especially for food), audit your invisible expenses monthly, and don\u2019t be afraid to focus on earning more when cutting isn\u2019t enough. None of these require extreme lifestyle changes, but together, they can free up hundreds of dollars every month.\n\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t have to be complicated,\u201d Schroeder-Gardner said. \u201cJust being intentional and having a plan makes a big difference.\u201d\nFor someone who turned financial intentionality into a full-time RV lifestyle and a thriving business, that\u2019s advice worth taking seriously.\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

One analysis from The Budget Lab at Yale University, based on data as of April 2, projects that the tariffs announced so far will cost the average American household $3,800 in purchasing power annually.\nThe effects could take a little bit of time as retailers figure out pricing strategies and negotiate with suppliers, but one strategy for consumers to save money could be to stock up on non-perishable items.\nIn a recent post on social media app Bluesky, entrepreneur Mark Cuban said that it\u2019s not a bad idea to go to a big-box store to get lots of consumables now, before retailers have to restock with the new inventory reflecting the cost of tariffs.\nCuban went so far as to note that items made in the U.S. are not immune from this issue, given that some retailers might use tariffs as an excuse to hike prices.\n\u201cWhen the market shifts because of tariffs, companies will find reasons to adjust their prices to match,\u201d added George Carrillo, co-founder and CEO at Hispanic Construction Council. \u201cYou buy now and avoid potential price hikes later.\u201d\nWith that in mind, consider stocking up on items such as the following if you have the space and budget for it:\nToothpaste\nOne of the items Cuban suggested buying now is toothpaste. According to Crest, toothpaste usually has a shelf life of about two years from the date it\u2019s manufactured.\nSo, consider how much toothpaste your family is likely to use by then, and think about buying a few tubes to last you for a while. If you know you\u2019re going to use it, there\u2019s a case for locking in the price now and potentially saving a few dollars.\nSoap\nSoap is another item suggested by Cuban. Similar to toothpaste, soap tends to last a few years, though the shelf life varies a bit based on factors such as whether it\u2019s liquid vs. bar soap. Still, if you know you\u2019re going to go through several bottles or bars in the coming year or two, it might make sense to buy those now at current prices.\nLaundry Detergent\nAnother household product that you might want to stock up on is laundry detergent, according to Carrillo. If unopened, liquid laundry detergent typically lasts around 12-18 months, while opened ones last around six months, according to Gain.\nOther formats can have different shelf lives, so consider that before stocking up. But in general, this is another product that you can potentially save a few dollars on since you know you\u2019re going to use it in the coming months.\nOver-the-Counter Medicines\nAnother suggestion, according to Carrillo, is buying over-the-counter medicines now. The expiration dates for these vary widely by product, but it\u2019s not necessarily a bad idea to buy some common drugs like headache or cold medicine so that you\u2019re not only prepared for getting sick but also possibly sparing your wallet a bit.\nWhile pharmaceuticals were exempt from the April 2 announcement of reciprocal tariffs, it\u2019s unclear exactly what will happen with this sector. Even if some tariffs are avoided, the cost of raw materials could go up for things like packaging. Or over-the-counter medicines could simply get caught up in the same potential price hikes that retailers could put on all items to spread out the impact of tariffs.\nToilet Paper\nLastly, consider stocking up on toilet paper now, suggested Carrillo. Toilet paper can last indefinitely and could get more expensive due to things like timber tariffs.\nOf course, you don\u2019t want to go overboard and fill up every spare inch of your house with toilet paper. Everyone remembers the toilet paper frenzy and shortages at the beginning of the pandemic.\n\u201cStocking up on essentials might seem like the responsible thing to do, especially with prices rising and uncertainties looming, but it\u2019s not without its challenges. When everyone tries to prepare at once, shelves empty faster, supply chains buckle and prices inevitably go up,\u201d said Carillo.\nFinal Thoughts\nWhen it comes to buying toilet paper \u2014 or any other consumables \u2014 try to seek the balance between being proactive vs. panicking.\n\u201cBuying an extra item during regular shopping trips can help you prepare without overwhelming stores or straining manufacturers. Collaboration also plays a big part in avoiding unnecessary chaos. By sharing resources with neighbors, friends or family, everyone can gather what they need without leaving others empty-handed,\u201d said Carrillo.\nCollaborating with friends, family, and neighbors can also make stocking up more practical.\n\u201cBy pooling resources, you can buy in bulk without stretching your budget too thin, and sharing storage across multiple households makes it much easier to manage,\u201d he added."

In fact, a new survey from Allianz found that Americans are literally more worried about running out of money than death. That\u2019s kind of a big deal to be losing sleep over.\nWhether you\u2019re flying solo by choice, circumstance or somewhere in between, figuring out how to retire comfortably on one income can feel daunting. According to Chris Heerlein, CEO of REAP Financial, saving for retirement is more challenging for single individuals because they lack the dual-income advantage that married couples or partners typically have.\n\u201cWithout this financial support, single individuals need to shoulder all saving and investing responsibilities on their own, which can feel overwhelming, especially when faced with higher living costs.\u201d\nThe good news? Plenty of people are in the same boat \u2014 and there are smart, doable ways to navigate it. Here\u2019s what you need to do to prepare.\nAim To Save at Least 15% of Your Annual Income\nContributing to retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs is crucial, said Heerlein, and if an employer offers a match, taking full advantage of it should be a priority.\nBuilding an emergency fund of three to six months\u2019 worth of living expenses is also essential to avoid dipping into retirement savings during unexpected financial setbacks.\nDennis Shirshikov, professor of finance at City University of New York and head of growth and engineering at Growth Limit, agreed that single people should make an effort to maximize their personal savings vehicles, like a 401(k) or an IRA.\n\u201cThe beauty of compounding means even if the amounts are small and consistent, it can grow big over time,\u201d he said.\nThis is because automating how funds are invested in retirement accounts via payroll deductions can help guarantee a more constant stream of contributions to your future retirement.\nThink About Long-Term Healthcare Costs\nAccording to experts, you need to come up with a plan for long-term healthcare costs and consider investing in long-term care insurance.\nBy staying disciplined with savings and working with a financial planner to develop a strategy, it\u2019s possible for you to overcome challenges and secure a financially stable retirement.\nShirshikov noted that another thing to keep in mind is establishing achievable goals according to your own specific situation. For example, figuring out a reasonable retirement goal should account for your lifestyle aspirations, potential medical expenses and other factors.\nFinancial planners often recommend that singles should be saving a bare minimum of 15% of their pay or more, depending on their income and goals for retirement.\nThe Bottom Line\nAs a single person, you will have to come up with a customized plan for saving for retirement that takes into account your current financial situation and long-term plans.\nAs Shirshikov wisely noted: \u201cThrough discipline, consistency and being strategic, any person, whether they are married or not, can lay a solid financial groundwork for the retirement golden years.\u201d"

Summer 2025 represents an ideal window for purchasing these sophisticated vehicles as dealers become increasingly motivated to clear inventory.\nThe depreciation trends affecting luxury automotive brands stem from shifting consumer preferences, economic pressures and evolving market dynamics. Smart buyers who understand these patterns can capitalize on exceptional opportunities to own premium SUVs at a fraction of original prices.\nAlfa Romeo Stelvio\nThe Alfa Romeo Stelvio faces severe depreciation challenges as this Italian sports SUV struggles to maintain competitive positioning against rivals. According to CarEdge, the Stelvio depreciates approximately 67% after five years, resulting in a resale value of just $18,957.\nRecent auction results demonstrate the dramatic value decline, with a 2024 Stelvio Veloce selling for $32,500 after originally costing $53,120, per Carscope report.\nFix explained that Stellantis ownership has contributed to declining sales alongside concerns about average interior quality and reliability issues.\nThe Stelvio was designed for curvy roads but faces steep competition from established luxury brands offering superior value retention. Consumer awareness regarding high starting prices and questionable long-term reliability continues to impact demand significantly throughout American markets.\nJaguar F-Pace\nJaguar\u2019s F-Pace experiences substantial depreciation problems as the British luxury brand struggles with declining consumer interest and weak sales performance.\nThe F-Pace depreciates 57.7% after five years, resulting in a resale value of approximately $24,090 according to iSeeCars. Fix noted that Jaguar\u2019s recent commercial campaign for their all-electric vehicles has fallen flat with American consumers.\nThe brand\u2019s transition strategy has created confusion among buyers, leading to significant inventory accumulation and aggressive pricing incentives from dealers. Jaguar\u2019s historically weak resale values compound current market challenges, making the F-Pace particularly vulnerable to steep price reductions.\nDealers are offering substantial deals to move inventory as consumer attention shifts toward more reliable luxury alternatives.\nPorsche Macan\nThe Porsche Macan faces unique depreciation pressures following the brand\u2019s controversial decision to electrify their most popular SUV model completely. While the Macan typically depreciates 42.5% after five years \u2014 with better value retention than competitors \u2014 electric versions are struggling significantly, per iSeeCars.\nFix explained that Porsche\u2019s transition to all-electric Macan resulted in minimal sales, forcing the reintroduction of gas-powered variants.\nThe Macan handles like a true sports car, but electric vehicle sales have fallen flat among traditional Porsche enthusiasts. EV Macans are accumulating on dealer lots with prices dropping massively as consumer demand remains disappointingly low nationwide. This situation creates exceptional opportunities for buyers interested in electric luxury SUVs at substantially reduced prices."

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nIf your idea of the perfect retirement is to enjoy leisurely mornings, you\u2019ll need to start preparing ahead of time. Retirement planning starts while you\u2019re still working. No matter how old you are, now is the perfect time to create a savings plan to help you retire comfortably.\nTo ease the process of planning for retirement, it\u2019s a good idea to break it down into some basic steps. You\u2019ll start by creating a vision of your retirement lifestyle, helping turn it over the years as you build your savings. Let\u2019s dig into the need-to-know, essential details for proper retirement planning.\n1. Start Saving Now\nEven if you are fresh out of high school, it\u2019s never too early to start saving for retirement. A good first step is looking at the different savings plans available.\nOne option is to open a high-yield savings account dedicated to your retirement savings. Many Americans rely on company-sponsored 401(k) plans to build retirement savings. Other options include:\n- One-participant 401(k)s if you are a business owner with no employees\n- 403(b)s\n- Traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs)\n- Roth IRAs\n- SIMPLE IRAs\n2. Contribute to Your Employer\u2019s Retirement Savings Plan\nIf your employer offers a 401(k) plan or other retirement plan, sign up and contribute. This is the best and easiest way to start building a retirement fund. When you use an employer-sponsored plan, your employer handles the heavy lifting. All you have to do is agree to have money deducted from your paycheck every pay cycle. You also get tax advantages. And if your employer matches your contribution, you get free money that goes into your retirement savings.\nIn 2025, employees can contribute up to $23,500 in their:\n- 401(k)\n- 403(b)\n- 457 plans\n- The federal government\u2019s Thrift Savings Plan\n3. Find Out About Your Employer\u2019s Pension Plan\nMany government employers offer a traditional pension plan rather than a 401(k) plan. If your employer offers a pension plan, find out if you\u2019re covered. You can ask for an individual benefit statement to understand your pension\u2019s value and ensure you know what\u2019s happening with your benefits before changing jobs.\n4. Invest In an IRA\nIf you don\u2019t have access to a 401(k) or pension plan, you should start investing in an IRA to build your nest egg. IRAs offer tax benefits that bolster your retirement savings over time. Even if you have a company-sponsored plan, invest in an IRA to save faster. Keep in mind that the maximum you can contribute to an IRA in 2025 is $7,000 a year.\nHowever, you get an additional \u201ccatch-up\u201d contribution of $1,000 to bring the total to $8,000 if you\u2019re 50 or older.\n5. Balance Your Portfolio\nSaving money for retirement is only part of your overall strategy. You also need to make sure your investments have the right mix of:\n- Stocks\n- Bonds\n- Mutual funds\n- ETFs\n- Real estate\n- Other assets\nSpreading your investments across diverse assets can mitigate risk and produce steady returns over time.\n6. Don\u2019t Touch Your Retirement Savings\nIt\u2019s important to never dip into these accounts unless you\u2019re facing a financial emergency. Taking loans and early withdrawals from your retirement savings can set your retirement plans back years. For example, if your 401(k) plan allows you to take a loan, you\u2019ll be required to repay it \u2014 including interest \u2014 according to strict terms. If you don\u2019t adhere to these requirements, any unpaid amounts will become a plan distribution.\nIn most cases, you\u2019ll have to include any previously untaxed amount of the distribution in your gross income the year the distribution occurred. You might also face an additional 10% tax on the amount of the taxable distribution.\n7. Set Retirement Goals\nOnce you have done the early planning, you should set a target age for retirement. Some people choose to continue working well into their 60s and 70s, especially if they enjoy your work. Others prefer to step out of the workforce to travel or spend time with loved ones while they are still in good health.\nYou\u2019ll also need to envision your ideal retirement lifestyle. Things to consider include:\n- Where you\u2019ll live\n- How much your lifestyle will cost\n- Whether you need to earn extra money through a part-time job or side gig\n8. Determine How Much Money You\u2019ll Need\nA big part of enjoying retirement is having enough money to live your ideal lifestyle. The U.S. Department of Labor recommends having 70% to 90% of your income to maintain your current standard of living. If you\u2019re currently earning $60,000 per year, you\u2019ll likely need $42,000 to $54,000 per year in retirement, or $3,500 to $4,500 per month.\nIf you think Social Security will cover most of this cost, you\u2019re probably mistaken. As of May 2025, the average Social Security retirement benefit was about $2,002 a month, according to the Social Security Administration. That\u2019s not nearly enough to cover the average living costs in the United States.\nTo help you formulate a good savings goal, look at the retirement calculator from GOBankingRates. You can use it to determine how much you might need to save for retirement. To figure out the right amount, it will use factors such as:\n- Retirement age\n- Savings\n- Income\n9. Familiarize Yourself With Social Security Benefits\nYou can start claiming Social Security benefits as early as age 62. However, delaying your claim can increase your monthly payments. The full retirement age is when you qualify for full benefits. That\u2019s considered 66 or 67 depending on when you were born.\nAfter age 70, there\u2019s no financial benefit to delaying further. To be eligible for Social Security retirement benefits, you need a minimum of 10 years of work, equivalent to 40 credits. Your benefit amount is calculated based on your 35 highest-earning years.\n10. Hire a Professional\nPlanning for retirement is not just about setting aside money for the future. You should develop an investment strategy that maximizes your returns and helps build an adequate nest egg for your golden years. This involves:\n- Understanding different investments\n- Managing risk\n- Planning for a long retirement to ensure you don\u2019t run out of money\n- Learning the tax laws and how best to navigate them\nIf you have the resources, you should hire a financial advisor. They can help you put together the best plan for your personal financial situation and retirement goals.\nWhat Should I Do 5 Years Before Retirement?\nIf you\u2019re retirement planning for the next five years, you\u2019re probably getting excited for this new chapter. Many of the decisions you make now can have a lasting impact on your retirement lifestyle. This period and the first five years after retirement are known as the fragile decade.\nYou want to ensure you\u2019re taking the right steps now to ensure a smooth financial transition into your golden years. Some actions to take include:\n- Maximize all of your retirement accounts if you can do so.\n- Take a close look at your current budget. Pay down as much debt as possible.\n- Consider purchasing supplemental coverage to assist with medical costs.\n- If you haven\u2019t already, reach out to a fee-only financial planner to make sure your investment plan is on track.\n- Decide exactly where you\u2019ll live and use this to determine your estimated cost of living.\n- Take a closer look at your estimated Social Security monthly benefit.\n- If you don\u2019t already, make sure you have an emergency fund in place, so you don\u2019t have to take extra money out of a taxable retirement fund or get a job if you\u2019re faced with an unexpected major expense.\nFinal Take To GO\nIt\u2019s never too early or too late to start planning for retirement. The more time you spend thinking about the kind of life you want and taking steps to prepare for it now, the more likely you are to enjoy your golden years.\nEven if retirement is a long way away, today\u2019s actions will hugely impact your future. Opening a retirement savings account and contributing a portion of each paycheck might mean you have to sacrifice a bit now, but that\u2019s nothing compared to the amount you\u2019ll have to stretch your budget in retirement without proper savings.\nAllison Hache and Jennifer Taylor contributed to the reporting for this article."

So many factors can eat into your paycheck, such as the cost of living, grocery bills and how many people you have in your care. Also, it\u2019s not all about how much you earn in a given month or year; it\u2019s more about your net worth and the way you use the money you have.\nHere are seven signs that indicate you\u2019re rich vs. middle class.\nYou Earn Well Above the Median\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, you\u2019re in the middle class if you earn between two-thirds and double the national median household income in the United States. To put this in perspective, and keep in mind that this can vary widely based on your location, the middle-class income range is roughly $56,600 to $169,800.\nHowever, the actual median household income is around $80,000 in America, so you can use that as a benchmark for your personal wealth.\nYour Paycheck Is High Relative to Your Peers\nIn both cases \u2014 middle class and rich \u2014 your paycheck might be higher than your peers. You\u2019re likely rich, though, if you earn significantly more money for your area and can handle far more than your basic needs.\nIn this pseudo version of keeping up with the Joneses, the definition of rich by comparison will depend on your specific location, lifestyle and circumstances. There is a huge gap between what is considered rich and what is not, and that\u2019s not even including your own personal perception.\nYou may feel like you\u2019re middle class if you have enough to cover your basic needs and utilities and can put money aside for the future. However, this might be considered rich to someone who is living paycheck to paycheck. So you may, in fact, be rich if you can spend money on luxury vehicles, higher-end vacations and other experiences without any financial issues.\nIt\u2019s More About Net Worth Than Salary\nPerhaps a more accurate indicator of whether you\u2019re rich or middle class depends on your net worth. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to be at Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos or Warren Buffett levels of wealth, but the rich typically have a high net worth via significant assets in the form of investment portfolios, real estate, businesses and more.\nIn contrast, a middle class person may have a low but positive net worth and simply own a bit more than they owe. Here are some general figures to use as a guide when determining where your net worth puts you:\n- High-net-worth individuals have liquid assets between $1 million and $5 million.\n- Very-high-net-worth individuals have liquid assets between $5 million and $30 million.\n- Ultra-high-net-worth individuals own $30+ million in liquid assets.\nYour Reliance on Debt Is Minimal\nWhen you\u2019re in the middle class, you\u2019re more likely to rely on some forms of debt to fund your lifestyle. This could be an auto loan or a mortgage, for example. Or it could be student loans for your kids. You might also use credit cards to cover certain expenses, like a family vacation.\nAn absence of these debts, along with a robust emergency fund and a diverse portfolio of investments, could be a tell-tale sign that you are more financially comfortable.\nYour Choices Aren\u2019t Based on Cost\nHow you allocate your paycheck each month is another major indicator of whether you\u2019re rich or middle class. Where rich people tend to lead a more extravagant life filled with designer goods, luxury travel and high-end experiences, the middle class is often more frugal in their choices, seeking financial stability through careful expenditures.\nYou\u2019ve Got Financial Emergencies Covered\nBoth middle-class and rich individuals can generally cover minor financial emergencies, but if you earn enough \u2014 or have enough set aside \u2014 to cover anything that comes your way, you\u2019ve likely crossed the threshold into wealthiness. Only the affluent don\u2019t live in fear that an unexpected financial setback or an emergency will alter their standard of living.\nYour Family Is Financially Set\nWhile middle-class individuals tend to have extra money for impulse buys and unexpected expenses, they typically aren\u2019t \u201cset for life.\u201d They also may not have much to pass on to their family in terms of generational wealth.\nTo be considered rich, you should have a growing nest egg that, by the time you retire, will easily cover your family\u2019s financial needs for at least the rest of your lives.\nAngela Mae contributed to the reporting for this article.\nMore From GOBankingRates"

These expenses are now coming back to bite them.\nWhat are they, and how can succeeding generations avoid these often innocent mistakes?\nLong-Term Care Planning\nPatrice Williams-Lindo, CEO of Career Nomad, saw just how painfully pricey long-term care for seniors can be while helping both her parents and in-laws navigate aging, illness and end-of-life care.\n\u201cI can tell you firsthand: the costs boomers didn\u2019t plan for aren\u2019t just financial \u2014 they\u2019re emotional, generational and systemic,\u201d Williams-Lindo said. \u201cMy family was quoted over $6,000/month for quality assisted living in Georgia. Multiply that over a few years and you\u2019re talking hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 money most didn\u2019t save because they assumed retirement meant rest; not round-the-clock care.\u201d\nMany financial experts, including Jay Zigmont, PhD, MBA, CFP, founder and CEO of Childfree Wealth, agreed with Williams-Lindo that lack of long-term care planning among boomers \u2014 and younger generations \u2014 is among the worst and costliest mistakes.\n\u201cA year in a skilled nursing facility runs $115k, on average. Men will spend 2.2 years in care, and women 3.7,\u201d Zigmont said. \u201cWithout a plan to pay for long-term care, the first person that needs care may cause their spouse to go broke.\u201d\nLong-term care, whether you pay out of pocket or with a long-term care insurance policy, is incredibly expensive, so it makes sense that so many boomers didn\u2019t bother.\n\u201cFor a couple that wants to pay out of pocket, I recommend setting aside $500k now,\u201d Zigmont said. \u201cIf you are single, you also need to set aside $500k. That may not make sense on the surface, but with a couple, your spouse often provides care for some time, making the total cost lower.\u201d\nInflation\nA common unplanned for expense that Frederick Saide, managing partner at MoneyMattersUSA, Advisory LLC often sees coming back to haunt boomers is inflation.\n\u201cI often get the response, \u2018That\u2019s not my problem,'\u201d Saide told GOBankingRates. \u201cThe assumption is retirement will not last all that long \u2014 certainly not 30 or more years \u2014 so \u2018I won\u2019t have to go through the inflation cycle three or four times\u2019 is the mindset.\u201d\nTo guide clients, Saide uses the Society of Actuaries and the American Academy of Actuaries calculator on longevity to help establish both individual and joint life expectancies.\n\u201cWhat I want is an agreement on the time horizon to plan for; otherwise, we won\u2019t have a clear direction on how much money is needed to last, and what the client wants their money to achieve for them,\u201d Saide. \u201cThis process is the reality check moment when I show from 2002 to 2023 inflation averaged 5.5%, nearly double the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\u201d\nSocial Security and Pension Tax Burdens\nMany boomers made the mistake of not looking too deeply into the fine print of Social Security and required minimum distributions (RMDs). Specifically, they didn\u2019t study the tax aspect.\n\u201cUp to 85% of Social Security benefits can be taxed, and RMDs can nudge retirees into higher tax brackets, triggering Medicare surcharges,\u201d said Andrew Latham, CFP, content director at Supermoney.com. \u201cRoth conversions in your 60s can help, but many wait too long.\u201d\nEstate Plan Updates\nDid you make a will in your 40s and not update it to reflect your needs and wants in your 60s? A lot of boomers make that mistake.\n\u201cMany times, people adopt a \u2018set it and forget it\u2019 mentality when it comes to estate planning,\u201d said Charles Nemes, co-founder and CEO at Nemes Rush Family Wealth Management. \u201cThis can lead to significant damage to the relationships beneficiaries enjoy today, and potentially put money into their hands when it could actually hurt them more than help them. Unfortunately, estate plans seldom reflect the current feelings of those who drafted them years ago because so many things could have changed. For example, a beneficiary may have issues with drugs/gambling/alcohol, or is getting divorced, has a child with special needs, is getting sued, or is in a high-risk profession.\u201d\nNemes recommended reviewing your estate plan at least every five years to be sure it clearly reflects your current knowledge and feelings about each beneficiary."

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nYou\u2019ve worked for decades and now it\u2019s payoff time. While everyone\u2019s talking about Caribbean cruises and European river tours, the most unforgettable vacation experiences are hiding where you\u2019d least expect them. These aren\u2019t your typical retirement trips; they\u2019re the adventures that will have you texting photos to your kids saying \u201cCan you believe your old man just did this?\u201d\nWith middle-class retirees typically having solid monthly income from Social Security and pensions, smart planning can unlock incredible experiences without financial stress. Here are 10 bucket list vacations designed for people who finally have the time to do things right.\nChase the Northern Lights in Canada\u2019s Wilderness\nForget Iceland\u2019s tourist crowds. Head to Canada\u2019s Northwest Territories where you can watch the aurora dance across massive dark skies while staying warm in heated aurora cabins or traditional teepees.\nWhy it\u2019s bucket list worthy: You\u2019ll witness nature\u2019s greatest light show in complete wilderness silence, with activities like dog sledding under the stars and ice fishing on frozen lakes. Many lodges offer Indigenous cultural experiences where you can learn traditional storytelling around massive bonfires while waiting for the lights to appear.\nThe perfect retiree experience: Multiple viewing opportunities over several nights mean you\u2019re almost guaranteed to see the lights, and you can combine it with snowshoeing, visits to local artisan workshops and stays in glass-roofed cabins where you can watch the aurora from your bed.\nTrek Through Vietnam\u2019s Legendary Rice Terraces\nNorthern Vietnam\u2019s Sapa region offers multiday treks through ancient rice terraces that cascade down mountainsides like green staircases to heaven. Stay overnight in traditional stilt houses with local ethnic families.\nWhy it\u2019s bucket list worthy: This isn\u2019t just sightseeing; it\u2019s cultural immersion. You\u2019ll wake up to mist rolling over centuries-old terraces, learn traditional farming techniques and share meals prepared over wood fires. The hiking ranges from gentle walks to challenging climbs, perfect for varying fitness levels.\nThe retirement advantage: You have time for the full experience \u2014 multiday treks with overnight stays in traditional villages, cooking classes with local families and visits to weekly markets where hill tribes gather in traditional dress.\nSafari Like an Explorer in Kenya\u2019s Private Conservancies\nSkip the crowded game parks. Book a stay at exclusive conservancies where you might be the only vehicle watching a pride of lions hunt, with night drives and walking safaris that regular parks don\u2019t allow.\nWhy it\u2019s bucket list worthy: You could witness the Great Migration, spot the legendary black leopards of Laikipia, and enjoy game drives where elephants walk right up to your vehicle. Some conservancies offer community visits where you can learn traditional Maasai crafts and participate in conservation efforts.\nExclusive experiences: Bush dinners under starlit African skies, hot air balloon rides over the savanna at sunrise, and the chance to help with wildlife research projects that contribute to conservation.\nFloat Above Turkey in a Hot Air Balloon at Sunrise\nClimbing into a hot air balloon and floating above the fairy chimneys in Cappadocia, Turkey, is a must-do bucket list experience, with balloons operating every morning at sunrise.\nWhy it\u2019s bucket list worthy: Picture this \u2014 dozens of colorful balloons floating silently above otherworldly rock formations as the sun paints everything golden. You\u2019ll drift over ancient cave churches, underground cities and vineyards that have been producing wine for thousands of years.\nGround adventures: Stay in actual cave hotels carved into the rock, explore the underground cities of Derinkuyu (eight levels deep!) and take pottery classes in the town where ceramics have been made for centuries.\nRide the World\u2019s Most Romantic Train\nThe Venice Simplon-Orient-Express isn\u2019t just transportation \u2014 it\u2019s a journey back to the golden age of travel. The carriages date from the 1920s and \u201930s, with art-deco features that are a feast for the senses.\nWhy it\u2019s bucket list worthy: You\u2019ll dress for dinner in an actual dining car with white tablecloths and crystal glasses while rolling through the Alps. Your cabin becomes a cozy sanctuary with fold-down beds and vintage luggage racks. Wake up in a different country than where you went to sleep.\nThe full experience: Multicourse meals prepared by world-class chefs, afternoon tea in the bar car with live piano music and the kind of old-world service that makes you feel like you\u2019re in an Agatha Christie novel.\nExperience Japan\u2019s Cherry Blossom Madness\nVisit during cherry blossom season when Japan goes nuts for sakura, with parks literally filling up with people having boozy brunches on blankets under the blossoms.\nWhy it\u2019s bucket list worthy: The entire country becomes a pink wonderland for just a few weeks. You\u2019ll join locals in hanami (flower viewing) parties, watch traditional tea ceremonies under blooming trees and experience a cultural phenomenon that transforms ordinary parks into celebration zones.\nUnique experiences: Take the bullet train through landscapes painted pink, stay in traditional ryokans with private hot spring baths and learn the art of sakura photography from local masters.\nCruise Patagonia\u2019s Dramatic Coastline\nBook passage on small expedition ships that navigate through fjords where glaciers crash into the sea with thunderous roars. You\u2019ll spot whales, condors and penguins while cruising through some of Earth\u2019s most remote waters.\nWhy it\u2019s bucket list worthy: Patagonia\u2019s Ays\u00e9n region is gaining special attention as a bucket-list destination. You\u2019ll witness glaciers calving into the ocean, cruise through narrow channels between towering mountains and land on beaches where you might be among the first humans to set foot.\nAdventure elements: Zodiac landings on remote shores, glacier hiking with professional guides and the chance to see the Southern Lights (aurora australis) if you\u2019re incredibly lucky.\nExplore Ireland\u2019s Ancient Mysteries\nDrive the Wild Atlantic Way, a coastal route that takes you past 2,500-year-old stone forts, medieval castles and cliffs that drop dramatically into churning seas. Stop in tiny villages where traditional music sessions happen spontaneously in centuries-old pubs.\nWhy it\u2019s bucket list worthy: You\u2019ll stumble upon castles and abbeys, unexpected coastal vistas and towns that are postcard-perfect. Many retirees combine this with genealogy research, tracing family roots while exploring the landscapes their ancestors knew.\nCultural immersion: Learn traditional Irish music, participate in sheep herding demonstrations and stay in castle hotels where you can dine in actual medieval great halls.\nMaster the Art of Slow Travel in Tuscany\nRent a villa for a month and live like a local \u2014 shop at weekly markets, take cooking classes with nonnas (aka grandmothers) and explore hill towns where time seems to have stopped in the Renaissance.\nWhy it\u2019s bucket list worthy: This is what retirement time allows: deep cultural immersion instead of rushed sightseeing. You\u2019ll learn to make fresh pasta from scratch, participate in olive harvests and discover family-run wineries that have been producing wine for generations.\nAuthentic experiences: Join long-term stays through Italy\u2019s elective residency visa, giving you access to the EU\u2019s broader cultural offerings. Take art classes in the countryside that inspired Leonardo da Vinci.\nAdventure Through Costa Rica\u2019s Wild Spaces\nCosta Rica is ideal for active retirees, offering everything from jungle hikes to zip lining, plus wildlife that abounds \u2014 expect to encounter monkeys, sloths, lizards and parrots in the wild.\nWhy it\u2019s bucket list worthy: You can white-water raft through rainforest canyons, zip-line through cloud forests, and help researchers track sea turtle nesting on remote beaches. The country\u2019s \u201cPura Vida\u201d lifestyle becomes infectious.\nConservation connection: Work with wildlife rescue centers, participate in reforestation projects and learn about sustainable farming from local families who\u2019ve protected rainforest for generations."

      "text": "6 Key Signs You\u2019ll Run Out of Retirement Funds Too Early\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nThe thought of running out of money in retirement keeps plenty of Americans awake at night. In a survey of financial planners by the Financial Planning Association and the Journal of Financial Planning, over 47 % of respondents rated running out of money as their clients\u2019 greatest retirement fear, with another 22% saying it was their clients\u2019 second biggest worry. Many also worry about affording the lifestyle they\u2019ve worked so hard for.\nThese fears are real but spotting early signs of trouble can help keep retirement savings from disappearing too soon. Here\u2019s what to look out for before it\u2019s too late.\nYou\u2019re Tapping Retirement Accounts Early\nWith Morningstar research predicting around 45% of people retiring at 65 could run out of money in retirement, being complacent about retirement portfolios could be a major error. Needing to access retirement savings before originally scheduled withdrawals can mean other income sources aren\u2019t covering needs.\nYou\u2019re Selling Investments To Pay Bills\nSimilarly, selling investments just to cover everyday bills means retirement savings aren\u2019t stretching far enough. When savings are used this way instead of for emergencies or big planned costs, it speeds up the risk of running out of money.\nYou\u2019re Using Credit Cards or Loans for Basics\nWhen everyday costs like groceries, gas or utilities start landing on credit cards without a clear plan to pay them off, it signals that retirement income can\u2019t keep up. Using debt to cover regular expenses can quickly get out of control and drain savings faster.\nYou\u2019re Withdrawing More Than 3.7% a Year\nRecent research from Morningstar recommends a safe withdrawal rate of just 3.7% annually, significantly lower than the old 4% rule. Withdrawing more than this increases the risk that retirement savings will run out too soon, especially when factoring in inflation, market downturns and longer lifespans.\nYou\u2019ve Drained Emergency Funds Without Rebuilding\nAn emergency fund that\u2019s repeatedly emptied for regular costs, then left empty, indicates retirement income is falling short. Without a cash safety net, even small unexpected expenses can force withdrawals that shrink retirement savings quickly.\nYou\u2019re Relying Only on Social Security\nAccording to the Social Security Administration, Social Security benefits represent approximately 31 % of annual income for people over age 65. If other income sources run dry and Social Security becomes the sole lifeline, it\u2019s a clear sign retirement savings aren\u2019t enough.\nRunning out of money is a top fear for those planning retirement, and these signs show when it\u2019s already becoming a real risk. Staying alert for these red flags can help prompt a course correction \u2014 adjusting spending, seeking guidance or rethinking plans \u2014 before savings run out for good."

What makes the difference are the small habits you build over time. Whether you\u2019re in your 20s or 50s the right habits will help you build the kind of retirement you want.\nThe 50 habits below will set you up for a comfortable retirement.\nSaving and Investing\n1. Start saving and investing early. Time is your greatest asset. The earlier you start, the more time your savings and investments have to grow.\n2. Automate your finances. Set up automatic transfers to your savings, investing and retirement accounts.\n3. Build an emergency fund. Save at least three to six months\u2019 worth of living expenses to avoid tapping into your retirement accounts during emergencies.\n4. Take advantage of employer 401(k) match. This is free money. Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.\n5. Contribute to an IRA. Use a traditional IRA or Roth IRA to grow your retirement savings tax-efficiently.\n6. Diversify your investments. Don\u2019t invest in one asset class. Spread your money across stocks, index funds, ETFs and bonds to reduce risk.\n7. Invest consistently. Use dollar cost averaging to invest consistently regardless of where the market goes.\n8. Rebalance your portfolio regularly. Review your portfolio year and adjust asset classes based on your risk tolerance and goals.\n9. Understand your risk tolerance. Pick investments that align with your risk appetite.\n10. Avoid emotional investing. Stick to your plan despite the market swings.\n11. Increase your retirement contributions annually.\n12. Don\u2019t panic during market downturns. Don\u2019t panic sell your investments when the market is going down.\n13. Stay invested long-term. Time in the market beats timing the market.\n14. Shop for insurance annually. Compare rates for auto, home and health insurance to ensure that you\u2019re getting the best rates.\n15. Use catch-up contributions. Contribute more to your retirement accounts once you hit the age of 50.\n16. Avoid early withdrawals. Don\u2019t tap into your retirement accounts unless it\u2019s an emergency that deserves the withdrawal penalty.\n17. Harvest tax losses. Strategically realize losses to offset gains and reduce current tax liability\nSpending and Budgeting\n18. Track your expenses. Know where your money goes so you can cut back when needed.\n19. Create and stick to a budget. Without a budget, you won\u2019t know how to allocate your money. It also helps keep spending in check.\n20. Pay off high-interest debt. Prioritize paying off high-interest debt like credit cards, followed by other debts.\n21. Live below your means. Spend less than you earn to free up cash for savings and investments.\n22. Avoid lifestyle inflation. Don\u2019t increase your spending when your income increases.\n23. Shop around before major purchases. Make sure you\u2019re getting the best possible deal out there.\n24. Cut unused subscriptions to save more.\n25. Cook at home to save money.\n26. Shop with a list. This helps prevent impulse buying and stick to your budget.\n27. Wait 24 hours before large purchases to prevent emotional spending.\n28. Treat yourself tax. For every item you splurge on, transfer the exact same amount to your savings.\n29. Buy quality items that last rather than buying cheap stuff repeatedly, costing you more over time.\n30. Review your bank statements monthly to know where you\u2019re overspending.\n31. Use cash back and rewards strategically. Don\u2019t overspend simply to get cash back and rewards.\n32. Use credit cards responsibly.\nIncome and Career\n33. Negotiate your salary and ask for a raise to increase your income.\n34. Maximize workplace benefits like professional upskilling.\n35. Build your network with professionals to open doors for better opportunities.\n36. Invest in your education for better career opportunities.\n37. Create multiple income streams. Taking on side hustles can boost your income.\n38. Use windfalls wisely. Channel bonuses and tax refunds to your retirement accounts.\n39. Plan career transitions carefully.Consider timing, finances and benefits when changing jobs to maximize long-term wealth building.\n40. Consider working longer.Delaying retirement for a few years can give your retirement savings a boost.\nRetirement Planning\n41. Set retirement goals.What do you want your retirement to be like?\n42. Estimate your retirement expenses to determine how much you need to save for retirement.\n43. Maintain good health. Healthy habits can help reduce medical expenses as you age.\n44. Maximize your HSA. Health Savings Accounts offer better tax benefits and can function as retirement accounts after age 65.\n45. Track your Social Security record. Make sure your earnings history is accurate for future benefits.\n46. Delay Social Security if possible.Waiting until 70 boosts your monthly benefits.\n47. Talk to a financial advisor.

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nPlanning for retirement is an exciting time, but let\u2019s be honest \u2014 creating a budget for it can be tricky. Whether you\u2019re freshly retired or starting to think ahead, it\u2019s easy to make some common missteps when figuring out how to manage your money.\nHere are some of the most frequent budgeting mistakes retirees make and how you can avoid them to keep your finances in check.\nOverestimating Investment Returns\nAccording to Kevin Huffman, owner of Kriminil Trading, the most common \u2014 and costly \u2014 mistake retirees make when planning a budget is overestimating what their investments will return.\n\u201cMost retirees expect their portfolios to return 7% or more every year without fail, and are used to hearing this is \u2018average\u2019 for the market.\u201d\nBut he said the markets are fickle, and lengthy downs and lower-than-expected returns can wreck a retirement strategy.\nUnderestimating their withdrawals could leave retirees with inflated expectations that risk their nest egg running out too gambled a long time, or steep adjustments in lifestyle in later life.\nA sensible approach, Huffman explained, would be to use conservative return estimates, stress-test the budget under various market scenarios, and incorporate buffers to help mitigate the sequence-of-returns risk. Particularly in the early years of retirement, when poor market performance can pack a punch.\nNot Reviewing and Adjusting Budgets Regularly\n\u201cRetirees often establish a budget early in retirement and then simply adhere to it for a decade or more, unmindful of inflation, rising health care costs or a change in spending patterns,\u201d said Huffman.\nThey may, for instance, assume that they will spend less in retirement on travel or hobbies than they do now, only to learn that discretionary spending doesn\u2019t fall so much as shift.\nAnd fixed costs such as property taxes, insurance and medical care often increase faster than anticipated. Without regular annual check-ups, retirees may miss red flags such as increasing debt or unsustainable withdrawal rates.\nHe added that continually adjusting your budget based on the latest in real world events is a cornerstone of long term financial well being.\nUnderestimating Health Care Costs\nHealthcare costs throw people off more than anything, said Andrew Lokenauth, money expert and owner of BeFluentInFinance.\nIn fact, Gallup reported that over 1 in 3 adults 50+ have forgone basics such as food to pay for healthcare.\n\u201cOne of my clients thought Medicare would cover everything \u2014 spoiler: it doesn\u2019t,\u201d said Lokenauth.\nHe said she ended up spending $800+ per month on supplemental insurance, prescriptions and out-of-pocket costs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s wild how many folks underestimate medical expenses by $100K or more over retirement.\u201d\nPricey Travel Expenses\nTravel\u2019s another big ticket item that trips people up.\n\u201cI get it \u2014 everyone dreams of that perfect retirement filled with exotic trips. But here\u2019s the thing: most of my clients who planned for 2-3 major trips per year didn\u2019t factor in all the little weekend getaways to see grandkids or friends,\u201d said Lokenauth.\nThose \u201csmall\u201d trips add up fast. One couple he worked with blew through their entire annual travel budget by June.\nHigh Housing Costs\nPeople assume their mortgage will be paid off, so housing expenses will drop. But Lokenauth said he had a client in Phoenix who didn\u2019t account for rising property taxes and insurance (up 40% in 5 years), plus maintenance on an aging home.\n\u201cTheir AC unit died in July \u2014 there went $8,000 they hadn\u2019t budgeted for.\u201d\nFailing to Account for Inflation\nThe inflation thing is brutal, said Lokenauth.\n\u201cI see way too many people create budgets using today\u2019s prices without considering how costs rise over time.\u201d\nFor example, a $50,000 annual budget today might need to be $75,000 in 15 years just to buy the same stuff.\nOne of his retired clients had to move to a smaller place because they didn\u2019t factor in 20 years of price increases.\nHelping Family Members Also Takes A Toll\nHere\u2019s another one nobody thinks about: helping family members.\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched so many retirement budgets get destroyed because adult kids needed financial help or aging parents required care,\u201d said Lokenauth.\nHe mentioned one couple had their perfect retirement plan sorted, then their daughter got divorced and needed help with her kids\u2019 college education to the tune of $100,000.\nTaxes Throw Everyone for A Loop\nLokenauth said many of his clients often forget that traditional IRA and 401k withdrawals get taxed as regular income.\nPlus, Social Security can be taxed depending on your other income.\n\u201cI had a client who planned to withdraw $60,000 yearly but didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d need another $15,000 just to cover the taxes.\u201d"
