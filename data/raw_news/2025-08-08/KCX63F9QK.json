  "title": "Getting Closer To AI Internet Protocols",
  "description": "As agentic AI keeps evolving, it\u2019s key to imagine a decentralized Internet with agent protocol",
  "content": "It\u2019s an important time for connectivity with artificial intelligence.\n\nYou might say that 2024 was the year of finding out about AI\u2019s agentic capabilities \u2013 although you could maybe argue that most execution has been within the last six months, 2024 was a blizzard of recognizing benchmarks \u2013 wait, AI can do that? And then: it can do that too?\n\nNow that we know all of this, as agents are getting more deployable and more frequently deployed, it\u2019s more relevant to look at how they will work, how they will connect to each other.\n\nI\u2019ve written before about how people at MIT are pioneering the NANDA (Networked Agents and Decentralized AI) protocol for connecting online AI agents, but to be honest, now seems like a better time to be scrutinizing these kinds of plans. Sure, the work on NANDA takes place in the context of other protocols like A2A and, famously, MCP, but since those other projects are tied to leading AI companies, why not involve academia in something so central to future interface design?\n\nMIT is also assisted by many partners in setting up the idea of NANDA to handle future intelligence Internet traffic. Here\u2019s what Dr. Harrick Vin at Tata Consultancy Services has to say:\n\nWe are rapidly entering a world where AI systems will be built using a decentralized network of AI agents, potentially traversing organizational boundaries. The design of such systems demands open protocols to discover, build trust, integrate, orchestrate, and exchange value among a network of intelligent agents. TCS is excited to support and contribute to MIT's decentralized AI program NANDA aimed at realizing this vision.\n\nOther businesses, like Mitsubishi Electric, are also involved.\n\nI saw an interesting kind of comparison from Abhishek Singh, someone close to this project, at a lightning talk presentation at Imagination in Action\u2019s event in April.\n\nSingh talked about how humans are a \u201csocial animal\u201d and how that helped them to stand out from other primates. (Not that monkeys aren\u2019t social, but\u2026) What I thought was interesting was a chart, comparing inputs and components of the success of the species, to the development of the Internet, and then to AI\u2026\n\nNote how the AI part just has ? ? ?\n\nEventually, Singh populates this part of the chart with things like MCP, Coupon Protocol, and registry design, showing how we might be able to evolve our technology to accommodate all of those intelligent agents that will be running around on the web, doing so many things on our behalf.\n\nAs for coupons, here\u2019s how Singh breaks down this concept:\n\n\u201cIn the Internet stack, we have the website, (and) we have hyperlinks that allow us to go from one page, one web page, to another web page, and so on,\u201d he says. \u201cThat hyperlink creates the web out of fragmented websites. Now we can index the web. We can search on the web. We can build reputation engines, we can build Google search, and so on.\u201d\n\nThen he discusses the similarity to coupons:\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean to build a hyperlink for the agents? We have a proposed protocol for this, this notion of our concept of coupons \u2026 these coupons are verifiable. We'll go into the details of privacy and authenticity later. But these interaction coupons are allowing you to capture the faces of how the knowledge is spreading across these areas. And as I said, you can use these coupons, then, to build services on top, which are replication, search, context, and so on.\u201d\n\nMidway through explaining all of this, he spoke to some of the enduring obstacles of getting all of this together:\n\n\u201cThere are some practical challenges in the world of agents that you have to acknowledge,\u201d he said, \u201cand we have to understand that genius won't solve them.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Singh suggested, progress has been made.\n\n\u201cWe are just getting started,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say we have made two contributions. One is (the) protocol and architecture layer, and the other contribution is actual application to demonstrate the potential. So the applications are very opinionated, when the protocols are very lightweight and flexible.\u201d\n\nOther lightning talks on the subject included Andrea Ridi talking about his years of work on startups, and the need to equip agents with what they need to function. My colleague Ramesh Raskar weighed in, too, as he\u2019s been very involved in NANDA, and a researcher named Cameron Dennis went over the work of some colleagues on a company called NEAR that is working on NANDA-related concepts.\n\nLooking at all of this, you start to get a picture of how this is going to work. Early speculative notions of web3, the semantic web, were often limited to a protocol like JSON for code porting, but now we have AI agents actually doing things online. How could that not be a game-changer for a previously established worldwide global network that runs so much of our societies across the board?\n\nStay tuned as a new Internet continues to develop.",
