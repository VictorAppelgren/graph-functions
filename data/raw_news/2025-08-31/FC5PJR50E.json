  "title": "Kansas City Current clinch NWSL playoff spot with 8 weeks to spare",
  "description": "With Saturday's win, Kansas City matched the 2024 Orlando Pride's record for the fastest team to secure a playoff spot in NWSL history.",
  "content": "The Kansas City Current have clinched their spot in the NWSL postseason, and they didn\u2019t wait until the final whistle of the regular season to book their ticket.\n\nThe Current beat the North Carolina Courage 2-0 at CPKC Stadium on Saturday with eight regular-season games remaining. Kansas City is the first team to book its spot in the 2025 NWSL Playoffs, matching the 2024 Orlando Pride\u2019s record for the fastest team to secure a playoff spot in NWSL history.\n\n\u201cJob is not finished,\u201d said midfielder Claire Hutton at the post-match press conference. \u201cWe\u2019re excited, but obviously, like I said, the job is not finished. We have a lot to do. I think we have eight games left in the league. We want to finish every single game winning, taking our points, whether we\u2019re at home or away, and we\u2019re here to win a championship. We\u2019re not here just to win the league. We\u2019re not here just to make the playoffs. We\u2019re making a difference this year.\u201d\n\nUnder coach Vlatko Andonovski, the Current sit atop the NWSL table for the 14th consecutive week, with 46 points, thanks to a 15-2-1 record through week 18 of the regular season. They are now 15 points ahead of the next closest team. The Kansas City Current have also scored a league-leading 36 goals, eight more than the Washington Spirit and San Diego Wave, while conceding just 10. That\u2019s three fewer than Orlando, the NWSL\u2019s next-best defense.\n\n\u201cWe have a rule. We celebrate tonight, we rest tomorrow, and we get ready for the next one,\u201d Andonovski told reporters post-match. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, because it\u2019s just a human nature when, when they get success, to have a little bit of a to get a little bit relaxed. But our group did not set a certain goal of whether it\u2019s catching a playoff, winning a shield, or getting a shot out; our goal is to come out as a group and be the best that we can possibly be in every game we play. And we\u2019ve operated like that for now a year and a half, and we were only focused on being the best that we can be in this game.\u201d\n\nIzzy Rodriguez and Lo\u2019eau LaBonta scored the Current\u2019s two goals Friday night. Rodriguez, the 26-year-old left back, buried a left-footed rocket from distance on the right, curling low into the bottom corner after the corner kick. Ten minutes later, captain LaBonta stepped up and smashed a penalty kick into the top left corner after her teammate Temwa Chawinga was fouled in the box by Kaleigh Kurtz.\n\nKansas City missed the playoffs in its inaugural 2021 season and again in 2023, but made a breakthrough in 2022, finishing second after falling 2-0 to the Portland Thorns in the final. The 2024 season was historic and highly successful for the Current, marked by a strong regular season, a second-place finish in the NWSL and a playoff run that ended in the semifinals in an overtime loss to the Orlando Pride.\n\nClinching a playoff berth early doesn\u2019t guarantee silverware, and the expanded eight-team postseason field still leaves room for chaos. Nonetheless, Kansas City\u2019s form ensures it\u2019ll enter October as a favorite.\n\n\u201cWe took a tough loss last year, and we carried that with us into this season,\u201d LaBonta said on the field after the match. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to work through it, and we\u2019re still working through it. You can see us solving problems in the field in real-time, and that\u2019s a maturity we\u2019ve grown into. I\u2019m really proud of this group.\u201d",
