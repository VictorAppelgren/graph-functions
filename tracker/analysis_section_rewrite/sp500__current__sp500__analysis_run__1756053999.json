      "feedback": "Strong start, but to reach world-class quality, overhaul the 0–3 week view into a tighter, first‑principles causal chain anchored to the two critical source IDs (I2SJU04DF for Israel–Houthi strikes and NBX9RA9WX for the Moscow gas‑cylinder incident) and push for explicit catalysts, thresholds, and monitoring. Key edits: 1) fix the causal chain so it runs: Strikes/new Houthi missile type (I2SJU04DF) → near‑term disruption in Red Sea port/energy/logistics flows → observable market signals (shipping risk premia, energy equities/FX) → potential de‑escalation or expansion; explicitly note how the Moscow event (NBX9RA9WX) adds a separate risk channel that can amplify risk appetite shifts if tied to broader global risk sentiment. 2) quantify where possible using exact figures from sources (e.g., furthest target ~2,000 km from Israel in I2SJU04DF; the Moscow blast casualty note in NBX9RA9WX) and avoid vague adjectives; 3) specify near‑term catalysts and invalidation points: escalation signals (new Houthi actions, Israeli counterstrikes, or a credible ceasefire breakthrough) vs de‑escalation headlines; 4) add concrete thresholds to monitor (e.g., port/Red Sea traffic disruptions persisting for 24–48 hours; multiple Red Sea ports offline; oil price or shipping indices moving beyond defined bands) and an “invalidation” path if none of the flare points materialize; 5) present a compact base case plus two explicit optional scenarios (de‑escalation leads to normalization; further escalation widens risk premia and volatility); 6) tighten source coverage and reconciliation: clearly attribute every market claim to I2SJU04DF or NBX9RA9WX, and explicitly note any tension between de‑escalation hopes and ongoing risk signals; 7) trim non‑essential context (e.g., unrelated travel/entertainment items) and produce a single, horizon‑driven paragraph with a brief “what to monitor next” sentence; 8) after each key claim, append the corresponding source ID to satisfy density and avoid conflicts. This will yield a sharper, testable, attribution‑rich 0–3 week lens that matches SECTION FOCUS and supports rapid reaction decisions.",
