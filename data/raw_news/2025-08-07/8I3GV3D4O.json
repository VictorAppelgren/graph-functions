  "title": "Should You Investigate Extendicare Inc. (TSE:EXE) At CA$12.66?",
  "description": "TSX:EXE 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore Extendicare's Fair Values from the Community and select yours While...",
  "content": "Explore Extendicare's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\n\n\nWhile Extendicare Inc. (TSE:EXE) might not have the largest market cap around , it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the TSX over the last few months, increasing to CA$14.73 at one point, and dropping to the lows of CA$12.27. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Extendicare's current trading price of CA$12.66 reflective of the actual value of the small-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Extendicare\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nGreat news for investors \u2013 Extendicare is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. We\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there\u2019s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock\u2019s ratio of 13.76x is currently well-below the industry average of 23.88x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. However, given that Extendicare\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Extendicare\n\nWhat does the future of Extendicare look like?\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Extendicare's revenue growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. Unless expenses grow at the same level, or higher, this top-line growth should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since EXE is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.",
