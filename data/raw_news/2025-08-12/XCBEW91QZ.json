  "description": "Climate Judiciary Project removes judge names and anonymizes testimonials on website after Fox News report exposed online forum between climate group and jurists.",
  "content": "An environmental advocacy group accused of trying to manipulate judges has removed and anonymized the names of jurists who worked with the activist network and praised its activities, following a Fox News Digital report exposing an online forum promoting climate litigation updates.\n\nThe Climate Judiciary Project (CJP), founded in 2018 by the left-wing Environmental Law Institute, describes itself as providing judges with \"authoritative, objective, and trusted education on climate science, the impacts of climate change, and the ways climate science is arising in the law,\" according to its website.\n\nThe group has been accused by Republican lawmakers, such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, of working to \"train judges\" and \"make them agreeable to creative climate litigation tactics.\" In July, Fox News Digital reported on CJP's yearslong, nationwide forum where jurists privately exchanged climate-related legal updates and information alongside CJP leadership \u2014 a forum that was abruptly made private in May 2024.\n\nCJP's testimonial page boasting praise from jurists who participated in the program was overhauled this summer, including obliterating testimony from a judge identified in Fox News Digital's July report. Fox Digital reviewed archived links to CJP's testimonial page and found Judge Sam Scheele's comments were still public on the site in May but were removed by the end of July following Fox Digital's report.\n\n\"It\u2019s been truly a privilege. I am welcomely absorbing everything that has been brought to us and I look forward to carrying that forward and paying it forward,\" read a quote from Scheele when he served on Indiana's Lake Superior Court\u2019s Civil Division, according to an archived link of the website's page from May.\n\nAt the end of July, another archived link showed that Scheele\u2019s quote and name had been removed from CJP\u2019s testimonial page, while four other quotes were attributed to anonymous \"participating judges.\" One remaining quote was still attributed to the former president of the William & Flora Hewlett Foundation, a nonprofit that funds progressive causes in the U.S. It is unclear the exact day the changes were made to the testimonial page.\n\nA spokesperson for the Environmental Law Institute told Fox Digital when asked about changes to the testimonial page that updates were made out of an effort to \"protect privacy and prevent baseless criticism and harassment.\"\n\n\"Judges are encouraged, and many required, to participate in continuing education on topics relevant to emerging trends in the law \u2013 including those related to science. Recent changes to CJP's website were made to protect privacy and prevent baseless criticism and harassment,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nScheele was among a handful of judges who communicated on CJP's online forum that ran from September 2022 and maintained until May 2024, according to documents previously reviewed by Fox News Digital. While Scheele's testimony was obliterated from the website's testimonial page, two other favorable quotes from judges were anonymized and attributed to a \"participating judge,\" while two other quotes remained unchanged and were both attributed to a \"participating judge,\" Fox News Digital found.\n\nFox News Digital obtained the archived chat history of the now-defunct chat forum between CJP and jurists last month, which detailed numerous messages between at least five judges and CJP employees trading links on climate studies, congratulating one another on hosting recent environmental events, sharing updates on recent climate cases that were remanded to state courts, and encouraging each other to participate in other CJP meet-ups.\n\nCLIMATE JUSTICE GROUP HAS DEEP TIES TO JUDGES, EXPERTS INVOLVED IN LITIGATION AMID CLAIMS OF IMPARTIALITY\n\nOne message posted by Delaware Judge Travis Laster, vice chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery, features a YouTube video of a 2022 climate presentation delivered by a Delaware official and a Columbia University professor that focused on the onslaught of since the mid-2000s.\n\nIt also included claims that such lawsuits could one day bankrupt the fuel industry.\n\nLaster shared the video in the group with a disclaimer to others: \"Because the link is of a judicial event that is otherwise not public, please do not forward or use without checking with me. I suspect that goes without saying, but the powers that be will be happier that I said it.\"\n\nScheele was among a handful of other judges who responded to Laster's video and message, praising it as \"great work.\"\n\n\"This is great work/great stuff, Travis; congrats on a job well-done, & thank you so much for sharing this!,\" Scheele responded, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital.\n\nCLIMATE LAWFARE IN BLUE-STATE COURTS COULD HURT US ENERGY CONSUMERS, EXPERT SAYS: 'HUGE EFFECT'\n\nScheele's office did not respond to Fox Digital's request for comment regarding why his name and testimony were removed from the website.\n\nScheele\u2019s office did respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s inquiry last month regarding his past participation in the forum, saying he first joined the 2022 National Judicial Conference on Climate Science more than two years before his appointment to the Indiana Court of Appeals.\n\n\"At the last minute, when another appointed delegate was unexpectedly unable to attend, Judge Scheele was asked by Indiana\u2019s state court administration to fill in as Indiana\u2019s representative, and he accepted the invitation. As is normal in conferences attended by our judges, this conference addressed emerging, hot-button issues that might come before the courts,\" Scheele's office said.\n\n\"Judge Scheele does not recall any substantive communication on the \u2018listserv\u2019 mentioned. He, like all of our Court of Appeals of Indiana judges, is dedicated to the unbiased, apolitical administration of justice in the State. He, like all of our judges, educates himself on emergent topics in the law and applies his legal training to evaluate the legal issues before him,\" the office continued.\n\nCJP told Fox News Digital of the now-defunct email list last month that it was created in September 2022 to help members of its Judicial Leaders in Climate Science program communicate and network with one another for the duration of the program.\n\nThe one-year program, established by CJP in coordination with the National Judicial College, \"trains state court judges on judicial leadership skills integrated with consensus climate science and how it is arising in the law,\" the group told Fox News Digital.\n\nCJP's educational events are done \"in partnership with leading national judicial education institutions and state judicial authorities, in accordance with their accepted standards,\" a spokesperson for the group said in an emailed statement. \"Its curriculum is fact-based and science-first, grounded in consensus reports and developed with a robust peer review process that meets the highest scholarly standards.\"\n\n\"CJP\u2019s work is no different than the work of other continuing judicial education organizations that address important complex topics, including medicine, tech and neuroscience,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nTED CRUZ CLASHES WITH KEY DEMOCRAT OVER 'SECOND PHASE OF LAWFARE' THROUGH FEDERAL JUDGES' ORDERS\n\nNews of the program\u2019s outreach comes as the U.S. has seen a sharp uptick in climate-related lawsuits in recent years \u2014 including cases targeting oil giants Shell, BP and ExxonMobil for allegedly using \"deceptive\" marketing and downplaying the risks of climate change, as well as lawsuits brought against state governments and federal agencies, including the Interior Department, for allegedly failing to address pollution risks or protect against the harms of climate change, according to the plaintiffs.\n\nSen. Cruz has repeatedly put CJP under the public's microscope, including in June during a Senate subcommittee hearing, called \"Enter the Dragon \u2013 China and the Left\u2019s Lawfare Against American Energy Dominance,\" where the Texas Republican argued there is a \"systematic campaign\" launched by the Chinese Communist Party and American left-wing activists to weaponize the court systems to \"undermine American energy dominance.\"\n\nCJP, Cruz said, is a pivotal player in the \"lawfare\" as it works to secure \"judicial capture.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCruz said CJP's claims of neutrality are bluster, and the group instead allegedly promotes \"ex parte indoctrination, pressuring judges to set aside the rule of law, and rule instead according to a predetermined political narrative.\"\n\nCJP has denied Cruz's accusations, and describes itself as \"neutral, objective information to the judiciary about the science of climate change as it is understood by the expert scientific community and relevant to current and future litigation.\"\n\nJudges have previously landed in hot water over climate-related issues in group forums, including in 2019, when a to an email chain with 45 other judges and court staff regarding an invitation to a climate seminar for judges hosted by the Environmental Law Institute. The judge was subsequently chastised by colleagues for sharing \"this nonsense\" and suggested it was an ethics violation, while others defended that flagging the event to others was not unethical.\n\nFox News Digital's Breanne Deppisch and Andrew Mark Miller contributed to this report.",

      "text": "FIRST ON FOX: A controversial judicial advocacy organization funded by left-wing nonprofits continues to work with judges and experts involved in climate change litigation despite publicly downplaying the extent of those connections.\n\"CJP doesn\u2019t participate in litigation, support or coordinate with any parties in litigation, or advise judges on how they should rule in any case,\" the Environmental Law Institute Climate Judiciary Project President Jordan Diamond wrote in a recent letter to The Wall Street Journal in response to criticism of the project.\nThe Washington, D.C.-based Environmental Law Institute (ELI) created the Climate Judiciary Project (CJP) in 2018, establishing a first-of-its-kind resource to provide \"reliable, up-to-date information\" about climate change litigation, according to the group. The project's reach has extended to various state and federal courts, including powerful appellate courts, and comes as various cities and states pursue high-profile litigation against the oil industry.\nA Fox News Digital review shows that several CJP expert lawyers and judges have close ties to the curriculum and are deeply involved in climate litigation.\nPrinceton University professor Michael Oppenheimer contributed to the CJP curriculum and presented \"Evidence of Change: Judging Climate Litigation\" with CJP\u2019s Sandra Nichols Thiam at the 2022 Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference July 20, 2022.\nOppenheimer has a long history of filing climate-related amicus briefs from 2019-2022 in litigation across several states.\nRobin Kundis Craig, a professor at the University of Utah's Law School, wrote a module for CJP in 2022 and has also filed several amicus briefs showing she is active in court cases.\nOne example occurred in 2023, when Craig is listed on an order granting legal scholars' request to file amicus, which was signed by Justice Mark Recktenwald, who, Fox News Digital previously reported, quietly disclosed last year that he presented for an April course in collaboration with the Environmental Law Institute Climate Judiciary Project.\nRecktenwald co-presented at a December 2022 National Judicial College webinar sponsored by CJP, \"Hurricanes in a Changing Climate and Related Litigation.\" In 2023, he co-presented with Professor Robert DeConto at a National Judicial College seminar, \"Rising Seas and Litigation: What Judges Need to Know about Warming-Driven Sea-Level Rise.\"\nIn October 2023, Recktenwald\u2019s Hawaii Supreme Court denied an appeal from oil companies to toss a Honolulu climate misinformation suit.\nCraig also filed an amicus in Hawaii state court in July 2022, where an order was signed by Judge Jeffrey Crabtree allowing the brief to be filed. Crabtree is a member of the National Judicial College Curriculum Development Committee, which creates curricula for \"Environmental Law Essential for the Judiciary.\"\n\"Don\u2019t underestimate the importance of the role of state court judges in environmental law,\" the curriculum's website states.\nAnn Carlson, who joined the Biden administration in 2021, served on ELI's board of directors for years while also \"providing pro bono consulting\" for Sher Edling, an eco law firm representing a number of jurisdictions, on litigation against oil companies, financial disclosures showed. Sher Edling counsel Michael Burger has also participated in multiple ELI events, and former Sher Edling lawyer Meredith Wilensky was previously an ELI Public Interest Law Fellow.\nBIDEN ADMIN REPORT COULD SLOW TRUMP'S EFFORTS TO UNLEASH DOMESTIC NATURAL GAS, EXPERTS SAY\nBurger is the executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law and an ELI presenter who has filed amicus briefs in support of plaintiffs in climate cases across the United States.\nUCLA\u2019s Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment hosted a talk in October 2017 with Sher Edling\u2019s Vic Sher, \"Suing Over Climate Change Damages: The First Wave of Climate Lawsuits.\" Ann Carlson was the moderator for that discussion.\nJohn Dernbach, listed as an expert on CJP\u2019s website, filed an amicus brief in 2019 as part of a brief of legal scholars in support of plaintiffs in City of Oakland v BP.\n\"Judges attending Climate Judiciary Project events are advised that they are walking into a left-wing lobbying shop,\" American Energy Institute President Jason Isaac told Fox News Digital. \"Under the guise of \u2018judicial education,\u2019 CJP uses activist academics to give a pro-plaintiff sneak peek at climate change lawsuits. This kind of politicking underlines that the climate change lawsuits themselves are a left-wing attack on our quality of life.\n\"The Supreme Court will have an opportunity early next year to hear a case asking whether blue states and far-left mayors like Brandon Johnson can sue energy providers for climate change. Let us hope the court takes the case and ends Green New Deal lawfare.\"\nFox News Digital previously reported that since it was founded more than five years ago, the project has crafted 13 curriculum modules and hosted 42 events, and more than 1,700 judges have participated in its activities. And multiple judges serve as advisers at CJP, potentially having an impact on its curriculum and modules.\n\"So-called \u2018climate change lawsuits,' lawsuits claiming that private companies should be monetarily liable for damage to public infrastructure allegedly caused by climate change, have exploded in the past five years,\" GOP Sen. Ted Cruz wrote in a letter to Environmental Law Institute earlier this year.\n\"In tandem with this unprecedented litigation, the Environmental Law Institute (ELI) launched a \u2018first-of-its-kind effort\u2019 to provide judges with \u2018education on climate science, the impacts of climate change, and the ways climate science is arising in the law.\u2019 It appears that ELI\u2019s goal in providing this \u2018education,\u2019 however, may be to influence judges to side with plaintiffs in climate change cases.\"\nThe letter went on to label Carlson as \"one of the program\u2019s architects\" and requested \"information to allow the Committee to evaluate the efforts of both Ms. Carlson and ELI to influence the federal judiciary in its adjudication of climate litigation.\"\nCruz alleged that \"ELI intends to accomplish via the courts what it cannot get enacted into law: a radical environmental agenda.\"\n\"To help judges reach those \u2018appropriate\u2019 decisions, the Project developed the \u2018Climate Science and Law for Judges Curriculum\u2019 (the Curriculum). While ELI claims the Project is \u2018neutral' and \u2018objective,\u2019 the Curriculum reads like a playbook for judges to find in favor of plaintiffs in artificial climate change cases against traditional energy companies: it includes courses that \u2018show how climate science is built on long-established scientific disciplines' and 'explore the human-caused component of [global] warming,\u2019 such as the \u2018causal connections between emissions\u2019 and \u2018changes in the climate.\u2019\"\nAn American Energy Institute report earlier this year alleges CJP \"hides its partnership with the plaintiffs because they know these ties create judicial ethics problems.\"\nAEI says Sandra Nichols Thiam, an ELI vice president and director of judicial education, acknowledged as much in a 2023 press statement, saying, \"If we even appeared biased or if there was a whiff of bias, we wouldn\u2019t be able to do what we\u2019re doing.\"\n\"Taken together, it appears CJP made the thinnest possible disclosures to create the appearance of rectitude,\" AEI states. \"But their admissions confirm that CJP exists to facilitate informal, ex parte contacts between judges and climate activists under the guise of judicial education. And secrecy remains essential to their operation, whose goal, as Thiam has said, is to develop \u2018a body of law that supports climate action.'\"\nAEI, a group self-described as \"dedicated to promoting policies that ensure America\u2019s energy security and economic prosperity,\" says CJP\u2019s work is \"an attack on the rule of law.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"In America, the powerful aren\u2019t allowed to coax and manipulate judges before their cases are heard,\" the report states.\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, an ELI spokesperson said, \"CJP doesn\u2019t participate in litigation, support or coordinate with any parties in litigation, or advise judges on how they should rule in any case. Our courses provide judges with access to evidence-based information about climate science and trends in the law.\n\"Of course, experts in the field are welcome to provide their expertise to CJP programs while separately and independently providing that same expertise in another setting that is unrelated to the CJP program. It is routine and encouraged for judges to participate in continuing education that exposes them to expertise in a wide variety of disciplines.\"\nFox News Digital\u2019s Thomas Catenacci contributed to this report"

      "text": "Climate change advocates are using \"tiny jurisdictions\" across the country to push their priorities through civil lawsuits, in an effort that could have significant national-level impacts on domestic oil production and even other industries, a conservative consumer advocate warns.\nPresident Donald Trump has taken steps to unleash a sweeping domestic energy agenda, including through preemptive lawsuits in at least four states aimed at preventing them from suing fossil fuel companies over climate change damages. However, a wave of other mainly Democratic jurisdictions across the country, such as in Oregon, Colorado and Washington, are still attempting to go after fossil fuel companies, something consumer advocate O.H. Skinner warns could have \"a huge effect\" on not only the domestic oil industry, but also on other key economic sectors like car manufacturing.\n\"You really have to understand that these suits matter a ton,\" said Skinner, who is a fossil fuel industry advocate and executive director at nonprofit Alliance for Consumers. \"If a court in Oregon declares climate change to be a public nuisance, and orders the nine biggest energy companies in America to stop the nuisance, they're going to unlock billions of dollars for their green initiatives, and going to be asking the court to prevent these energy companies from opening a new oil field, drilling, producing, refining, everywhere.\"\nNJ LAWSUIT CLAIMING OIL COMPANIES CAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE DEALT MASSIVE BLOW IN COURT\nSkinner is referring to an ongoing case in Oregon \u2013 Multonomah County to be precise, which is seeking $52 billion in their suit against oil companies. He also pointed out that several other \"public nuisance lawsuits\" across the country \"are asking for national fixes from courtrooms in little, tiny jurisdictions.\"\n\"One county gets 50 billion. Another county gets 50 billion. What's their real goal? Bankrupting the energy industry across the whole country,\" Skinner said. \"If they were to get such a win, it would start to have a huge effect.\"\nTrump signed an executive order in April targeting state and local lawsuits against domestic energy producers, which, in part, instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to identify and take action against state laws and civil actions that burden domestic energy producers. So far, his administration has filed lawsuits against at least four states, New York, Vermont, Michigan and Hawaii, to block them from suing fossil fuel companies for damages.\nWHITE HOUSE RIPS BLUE STATE DEMS USING 'LAWFARE' TO PROTECT WIND INDUSTRY\nSkinner said that as a consumer advocate, he \"gets really nervous\" about these lawsuits because they don't just end with fossil fuels.\n\"They are trying to direct national policy through the courtroom, because they've lost in so many other important venues, like Congress or at the ballot box for president,\" Skinner said. \"First they want to stop oil production, then they want it, then they're going to go and try to say that the car companies all have to switch to zero emission vehicles. And it goes on and on and on.\"\nOur Children's Trust, an Oregon-based nonprofit that is currently litigating several state and federal-level lawsuits on behalf of youth plaintiffs over climate change-related matters, including one against the Trump administration over the implementation of his numerous executive directives on unleashing fossil fuels.\nCLIMATE LAWFARE IS RUNNING INTO A POWERFUL FORCE LIBERALS DIDN\u2019T EXPECT\n\"No president can act in ways that harm our kids or tell states they have to power their electricity grid with fossil fuels when wind and solar are the cleaner, cheaper, and healthier option,\" a spokesperson for the group said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"What\u2019s important for Americans to know is that wind and solar energy are not only the most abundant source of energy we have, but because of American ingenuity, they are also the cheapest form of energy today. It\u2019s why clean energy was the fastest-growing energy sector in Texas last year,\" the spokesperson continued. \"For families who pay the electricity bill, they will spend less for every fossil fuel we substitute with wind and solar energy. Even more importantly, medical doctors say we can prevent asthma in children, and create healthier communities for our kids. We all share the value of protecting life, especially our children's.\""

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: An environmental advocacy group accused of trying to manipulate judges organized a years-long, nationwide online forum with jurists to promote favorable info and litigation updates regarding climate issues \u2013 until the email-styled group chat was abruptly made private, Fox News Digital found.\nThe Climate Judiciary Project (CJP) was founded in 2018 by a left-wing environmental nonprofit, the Environmental Law Institute (ELI), and pitches itself as a \"first-of-its-kind effort\" that \"provides judges with authoritative, objective, and trusted education on climate science, the impacts of climate change, and the ways climate science is arising in the law.\"\nBut critics, such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, say CJP is funded by China and left-wing activists for one purpose.\n\"They fund CJP to train judges,\" Cruz said during a June hearing. \"So, quote, unquote, train in climate science and make them agreeable to creative climate litigation tactics. Then, these left-wing bankrollers turn around and fund the climate litigators who will bring these bogus cases before those same judges that they've just indoctrinated.\nSUPREME COURT LIMITS JUDGES' AUTHORITY TO BLOCK INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS OVER ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS\n\"This is like paying the players to play and paying the umpire to call the shots the way you want.\"\nCruz did not immediately provide evidence to back that characterization, and CJP heavily disputes that claim.\nThe group describes itself as providing \"neutral, objective information to the judiciary about the science of climate change as it is understood by the expert scientific community and relevant to current and future litigation.\"\nOne of the efforts CJP launched included rolling out an email-styled listserv by which leaders from the Climate Judiciary Project could message directly with judges, documents obtained by Fox News Digital show. The listserv was launched in September 2022 and maintained until May 2024, according to the documents. A portal website page for the forum was previously publicly available, with an archived link saved in July 2024 showing there were 29 members in the group.\n\"Judicial Leaders in Climate Science,\" the archived website link reviewed by Fox Digital reads, accompanied by a short description that the group was a \"Forum for Judicial Leaders in Climate Science to share resources.\"\nA link to the forum now leads to an error warning, stating, \"Sorry, but that group does not exist.\"\nFox News Digital obtained the archived chat history of the forum, which detailed numerous messages between at least five judges and CJP employees trading links on climate studies, congratulating one another on hosting recent environmental events, sharing updates on recent climate cases that were remanded to state courts, and encouraging each other to participate in other CJP meet-ups.\nOne message posted by Delaware Judge Travis Laster, vice chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery, features a YouTube video of a 2022 climate presentation delivered by a Delaware official and a Columbia University professor that focused on the onslaught of climate lawsuits since the mid-2000s. It also included claims that such lawsuits could one day bankrupt the fuel industry.\nLaster shared the video in the group with a disclaimer to others: \"Because the link is of a judicial event that is otherwise not public, please do not forward or use without checking with me. I suspect that goes without saying, but the powers that be will be happier that I said it.\"\nA handful of other judges responded to Laster's video and message, praising it as \"great work.\"\nSENATORS SOUND OFF AS SUPREME COURT HEARS CASE ON NATIONWIDE INJUNCTIONS\n\"This is great work/great stuff, Travis; congrats on a job well-done, & thank you so much for sharing this!,\" Indiana Court of Appeals Judge Stephen Scheele responded, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital.\nAnother judge in a Nebraska county court added that he had not watched the video yet but said the state court administrator's office was interested in a similar program focused on \"litigation and climate change.\" The Nebraska judge said he \"may need to lean on all of you for guidance and direction.\"\nThe judges' correspondence on the forum included their typical email signatures, showcasing their job titles as \"judge\" as well as which court they preside over.\nThe climate activists also posted messages directed to the judges on the listserv, Fox News Digital found, including a science and policy analyst at the Environmental Law Institute posting a lengthy message on Nov. 15, 2023. The message encouraged judges and climate activists alike to review the government's publication of the Fifth National Climate Assessment that year, which the environmental crusader said contained \"good news and bad news.\"\n\"The bad news is that the impacts of climate change are being felt throughout all regions of the United States, and these impacts are expected to worsen with every fraction of a degree of additional warming. The report finds that climate change will continue to affect our nation's health, food security, water supply, and economy,\" the message read.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS ADDRESSES DIVISIONS BETWEEN JUSTICES AFTER SEVERAL RECENT SCOTUS SKIRMISHES\n\"The good news is that the report also notes that it isn't too late for us to act,\" the message continued, before encouraging the 28 other members of the group to go over CJP's climate curricula, such as \"Climate Science 101\" and \"Climate Litigation 101,\" and send over any feedback.\n\"As you know, our Climate Judiciary Project exists to be as beneficial to judges as possible, so any insights you might have for us would be very helpful!\" the message added when asking members to review the curricula.\nIn another message, CJP's manager, Jared Mummert, sent a message to the group in May 2024 praising the judges for their mentorship of a second group of \"Judicial Leaders in Climate Science\" \u2013 which included 14 judges from 12 states and Puerto Rico \u2013 as part of a partnership between CJP and the National Judicial College. The National Judicial College provides judicial training for judges across the country from its Reno, Nevada, campus.\n\"We want to give a special \u2018thank you\u2019 to those who are serving as mentors to this second cohort!\" the message read. It added that CJP was ramping up its number of \"engagement opportunities\" to \"every six months for both cohorts of judges to come together to share updates and connect with one another.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to five of the judges on the listserv for comment, four of whom did not respond.\nScheele's office told Fox News Digital on Thursday that he first joined the 2022 National Judicial Conference on Climate Science, more than two years before he was appointed to the Court of Appeals of Indiana, after another delegate was unable to attend.\n\"At the last minute, when another appointed delegate was unexpectedly unable to attend, Judge Scheele was asked by Indiana\u2019s state court administration to fill in as Indiana\u2019s representative, and he accepted the invitation. As is normal in conferences attended by our judges, this conference addressed emerging, hot button issues that might come before the courts,\" Scheele's office said.\nIt added: \"Judge Scheele does not recall any substantive communication on the \u2018listserv\u2019 mentioned. He, like all of our Court of Appeals of Indiana judges, is dedicated to the unbiased, apolitical administration of justice in the State. He, like all of our judges, educates himself on emergent topics in the law and applies his legal training to evaluate the legal issues before him.\"\nCJP, for its part, said the now-defunct email list was created in September 2022 to help members of its Judicial Leaders in Climate Science program communicate and network with one another for the duration of the program.\nThe one-year program, established by CJP in coordination with the National Judicial College, \"trains state court judges on judicial leadership skills integrated with consensus climate science and how it is arising in the law,\" the group told Fox News Digital.\nJudges quietly working behind the scenes with climate and environmental activists have drawn criticism from conservative lawmakers in recent years as climate-focused suits increased, including those who have accused CJP of manipulating the justice system.\nCruz, for example, has been at the forefront of condemning CJP for joining forces with the National Judicial College. Cruz argued in a 2024 opinion piece that he is \"concerned that this collaboration means court staff are helping far-left climate activists lobby and direct judges behind closed doors.\"\nDOJ SUES FOUR BLUE STATES OVER 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL' CLIMATE LAWS THREATENING US ENERGY SECURITY\nCruz again railed against CJP during a Senate subcommittee hearing in June, called \"Enter the Dragon \u2013 China and the Left\u2019s Lawfare Against American Energy Dominance,\" where the Texas Republican argued there is a \"systematic campaign\" launched by the Chinese Communist Party and American left-wing activists to weaponize the court systems to \"undermine American energy dominance.\" CJP, Cruz said, is a pivotal player in the \"lawfare\" as it works to secure \"judicial capture.\"\nCruz said CJP's claims of neutrality are bluster, and the group instead allegedly promotes \"ex parte indoctrination, pressuring judges to set aside the rule of law, and rule instead according to a predetermined political narrative.\"\nJudges have previously landed in hot water over climate-related issues in group forums, including in 2019, when a federal judge hit \"reply all\" to an email chain with 45 other judges and court staff regarding an invitation to a climate seminar for judges hosted by the Environmental Law Institute. The judge was subsequently chastised by colleagues for sharing \"this nonsense\" and suggested it was an ethics violation, while others defended that flagging the event to others was not unethical.\nFox News Digital spoke with Heritage Foundation senior legal fellow Zack Smith, who explained there has been an overarching increase in courts promoting trainings for judges on issues they would eventually be asked to preside over impartially, pointing to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts\u2019 DEI trainings for judges during the Biden era. The office works as the administrative agency for the U.S. court system, handling issues from finances to tech support.\n\"There's a problem right now with many courts putting forward, seeming to take sides on issues they will be asked to address through the trainings that they're putting forward. And this was a particular problem with the DEI trainings that different federal district courts were putting on, that the Administrative Office of U.S. courts were sponsoring. It appeared that the judiciary itself was encouraging violations of the Constitution, violations of federal law, and most problematically was taking sides in issues they would eventually be asked to sit and preside over impartially,\" he said.\nJustice Department officials did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s requests for comment on the CJP program in question, or other efforts to educate judges more directly on climate issues.\nStill, news of the program\u2019s outreach comes as the U.S. has seen a sharp uptick in climate-related lawsuits in recent years, including cases targeting oil majors Shell, BP and ExxonMobil for allegedly engaging in \"deceptive\" marketing practices and downplaying the risks of climate change, as well as lawsuits bought against state governments and U.S. agencies, including the Interior Department, for failing to adequately address risks from pollution or adequately protect against the harm caused by climate change, according to plaintiffs who filed the suits.\nCJP's educational events are done \"in partnership with leading national judicial education institutions and state judicial authorities, in accordance with their accepted standards,\" a spokesperson for the group said in an emailed statement. \"Its curriculum is fact-based and science-first, grounded in consensus reports and developed with a robust peer review process that meets the highest scholarly standards.\"\n\"CJP\u2019s work is no different than the work of other continuing judicial education organizations that address important complex topics, including medicine, tech and neuroscience,\" this person added.\nThe number of climate-related lawsuits in the U.S. has increased significantly in recent years, including during the last two years of the Biden administration. To some extent, the educational efforts led by CJP appear to have been enacted in earnest to address real questions or concerns judges might have in presiding over these cases for the first time \u2013 many of which seek tens of millions of dollars in damages.\nThe Supreme Court agreed earlier this month to grant a request from ExxonMobil and Chevron to consider whether to transfer two Louisiana lawsuits from state to federal court.\nWhile the move itself is not immediately significant, it will be closely watched by oil and gas majors, as they look to navigate the complex landscape of environmental lawsuits, including lawsuits filed by state and local governments. Oil majors typically prefer to have their cases heard by federal courts, which are seen as more sympathetic to their interests.\nSince Trump\u2019s re-election in 2024, the cases appeared to have died down, at least to an extent. U.S. appeals courts have declined to take up many challenges filed on behalf of plaintiffs in several states who have sued claiming government inaction and failure to act to protect against known harms from fossil fuel extraction and production in the U.S.\nCJP\u2019s program is run by ELI in partnership with the Federal Judicial Center, the latter of which bills itself as the \"research and education center\" for judges across the country.\nTheir work includes partnerships with myriad outside groups beyond the CJP aimed at informing and educating judges on a range of issues, including neuroscience and bioscience, constitutional law, and bankruptcy, among other things.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAccording to their website, the effort is important to help judges understand relevant case law and ethics, sentencing guidelines, and other types of issue-specific programs they might be encountering for the first time.\nFox News Digital has previously reported on CJP's cozy relationship with judges, including when the group's president, Jordan Diamond, detailed in a Wall Street Journal letter to the editor in September that the group \"doesn\u2019t participate in litigation, support or coordinate with any parties in litigation, or advise judges on how they should rule in any case.\"\nA subsequent Fox News Digital review published in December found that several CJP expert lawyers and judges continued to have close ties to the curriculum and are deeply involved in climate litigation, including tapping insight from university professors who have also filed several climate-related amicus briefs.\n\"CJP doesn\u2019t participate in litigation, support or coordinate with any parties in litigation, or advise judges on how they should rule in any case,\" an ELI spokesperson defended in a comment to Fox News Digital in December. \"Our courses provide judges with access to evidence-based information about climate science and trends in the law.\"\nFox News Digital's Andrew Mark Miller contributed to this piece."

  "argos_summary": "The Climate Judiciary Project (CJP), an initiative by the Environmental Law Institute, has faced accusations of attempting to influence judges in climate litigation through a private online forum where judges exchanged information and updates on climate-related legal matters. Following a report by Fox News Digital, CJP anonymized testimonials from judges, including removing a judge's name and comments praising the program, which critics, including Senator Ted Cruz, argue undermines judicial impartiality. CJP defends its actions as providing necessary education on climate science to judges, asserting that it does not engage in litigation or advise judges on case rulings.",
