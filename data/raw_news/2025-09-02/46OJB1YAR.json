  "title": "How TCU social media leaned into Bill Belichick hype: Memes, one-liners and plenty of receipts",
  "description": "TCU\u2019s director of football creative media kept the zingers coming throughout the easy win: \u201cThis part is just so much fun.\"",
  "content": "TCU had a heckuva time ruining Bill Belichick\u2019s big debut at North Carolina on Monday night. The only one who might\u2019ve had as much fun as the Horned Frog players in Chapel Hill was 32-year-old Sam Lazarus.\n\nTCU\u2019s director of football creative media, like the rest of the Horned Frogs, had taken note of how everything surrounding Monday night\u2019s game was about Belichick and his team. Of course, that wasn\u2019t a shock considering that the 73-year-old Belichick, the greatest coach in NFL history, was coaching his first game at the college level. The curiosity factor of that probably even topped what the Horned Frogs faced when they opened up two years ago against Colorado in Deion Sanders\u2019 first FBS game. Still, for a team coming off a nine-win season with most of its top talent returning, the disrespect of being reduced to some random faceless opponent felt like a snub.\n\nAnd, when the Tar Heels opened the game with an impressive seven-play, 83-yard touchdown drive to go up 7-0, it felt like the six-time Super Bowl-winning head coach was going to work some of his wizardry against his first college opponent. North Carolina did make that first drive look easy, and it only ratcheted up the hype another few notches. From that point on, though, the Horned Frogs systematically dismantled everything Belichick and his team attempted to do, and Lazarus and his three-person crew were ready to celebrate all of it from their TCU Football X account with memes, one-liners and lots of receipts.\n\nEarly on, the TCU Football feed sent out posts praising their players for forcing a three-and-out on defense, and then for star QB Josh Hoover\u2019s pinpoint TD pass to Jordan Dwyer to tie the score. But an hour later, after Bud Clark\u2019s pick six, a few field goals and a long touchdown run, Lazarus started to lean into the vibe of the evening. Like the TCU scoreboard, which ran off 41 unanswered points en route to a 48-14 victory, his posts came in a flurry.\n\nLazarus proceeded to zing everyone, from Skip Bayless to Colin Cowherd to the UNC Football account, before the night was over.\n\n\u201cTCU was the favorite in the game, but you probably wouldn\u2019t have known it beforehand,\u201d Lazarus told The Athletic on Tuesday. \u201cA lot of that played into how we approached it afterwards. We wanted to play into the irony of how it was all covered.\u201d\n\nLazarus, who is in his second season at TCU, previously worked for UCLA and Tulsa, his alma mater. He said when he was hired at TCU, it was with the goal of showcasing the players and telling their stories.\n\nMuch of what Lazarus and his team posted from Chapel Hill was spur-of-the-moment stuff. Like his response to the Cowherd tweet that popped up right after the Tar Heels\u2019 opening drive, when the longtime TV host declared Belichick \u201cthe second best college coach I\u2019ve ever seen, just below Saban.\u201d\n\nSame with his dunk on the Skip Bayless tweet predicting that \u201cTCU is about to get blown out. Too much MJ, LT. About to get Mossed.\u201d\n\nOf course, none of those guys were actually playing in the game. Someone sent that to Lazarus, and it didn\u2019t take him long to respond with the perfect meme of Bayless\u2019 old colleague Stephen A. Smith laughing his head off.\n\n\u201cJust knowing the whole Skip-Stephen A. rivalry, that made perfect sense,\u201d Lazarus said.\n\nA week-old Carolina Football tweet with behind-the-scenes footage touting a docuseries on Belichick\u2019s team was another easy target. It might\u2019ve felt like trolling when he responded with \u201cwhen does episode one come out?\u201d But Lazarus said he is genuinely curious to see that show. He also knows that\u2019s not why the post already has more than five million views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a joke, but there\u2019s also a little bit of seriousness in that you want to see how they cover it,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the night, a glorious evening for TCU, the Horned Frogs football X account has received more than 17 million views. Not bad for a school that only has around 13,000 students, but that\u2019s part of the goal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a private school in a league with a lot of huge schools, UCF, ASU, Texas Tech is big,\u201d Lazarus said. \u201cWe have to get more creative with how we get attention because we don\u2019t have that same built-in fan base that some others have.\u201d\n\nWhen he enrolled in college, Lazarus, a huge \u201cMoneyball\u201d fan, had visions of working for a Major League Baseball front office, but he eventually switched to a marketing track. At one point, he thought he might go the athletic director path, but as he\u2019s seen the evolution of the social and creative aspects of college athletic programs that have grown so much, he\u2019s found a niche he loves.\n\n\u201cThis part is just so much fun,\u201d he said.\n\nIt sure was for TCU fans.",
