  "content": "How Many Nuclear Submarines Does China Have & How Does The US Navy Compare?\n\nThe more you read the news these days, the more things seem to be getting testy, with geopolitical tensions rising around the world. In the never-ending battle for superpower status, China seems to be keeping its foot on the gas, unleashing endless domestic infrastructure projects while shoring up its military and provoking neighbors. To ensure dominance in the South China Sea, East China Sea, and beyond, China employs a large array of naval vessels to patrol these waters. Some are impressive and easy to spot, like its few aircraft carriers, sticking up high above the ocean's surface, while others lie deep beneath. China's People's Liberation Army Navy forces (PLAN) have a grouping of nuclear-powered submarines in its arsenal. These vessels are used both as a defensive measure and to maintain balance with American might, as its main rival. China's current nuclear submarine fleet has been the product of a slow and steady buildup, comprised of both older and newer boats, believed to total 12. With rising tensions and provocations aimed at Taiwan, China's old imperial tendencies remain at the fore, as they seek to maintain a strong regional military presence \u2014 it's currently an interesting and potentially dangerous era in East Asian geopolitics.\n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, China expanded its submarine fleet, with a primary focus on diesel-electric variants. Then, in the early 1970s, China developed its first nuclear submarines, with the launch of the Type 091 (Han) class, later followed by the Shang class, in the early 2000s. While the exact number of nuclear subs China has remains somewhat of a mystery, thought to be around 12 as of 2024, there's no denying that the country is a superpower. Having the ability to deploy nuclear missiles from subs gives China a regional advantage. To be able to do this, China's most advanced Type 094 sub carries a total of 12 JL-2 missiles with a range of 5,592 nautical miles. These Shang-class nuclear subs are 360 feet long, with a 36-foot beam, have a max speed of 30 knots, and are also able to launch anti-ship ballistic missiles with 248-mile ranges. Comparatively, the U.S. Navy operates a substantially larger fleet of nuclear-powered subs, with 71 boats total in service. Within that, there are the Ohio, Los Angeles, Seawolf, and Virginia-class boats \u2014 all of which are nuclear-powered, with 14 being ballistic missile-capable, 53 attack subs, and four guided missile subs. Each class of American submarines can carry a variety of missiles, with Trident II and Tomahawk ballistic missiles at the ready. The former has a range of 6,500 nautical miles, while the latter can hit targets 1000 miles away. In sheer numbers, the U.S. outguns China.\n\nThe U.S. Navy is amid a fleet reconfiguration, where it seeks to retire some of the Ohio-class boats soon, while onboarding newer Columbia-class subs, which can carry up to 16 Trident ballistic missiles. Another recent development in the sub program is the forthcoming sale of three Virginia-class subs to the Aussies, which will operate out of HMAS Stirling base, in Western Australia, for more firepower in the Indo-Pacific region. U.S. government officials (via Defense News) have stated on record that they want to swap out older subs and increase the fleet total to 66, but this won't become a reality until 2054, with an urgency to keep up with Chinese advancements. Many officials seem weary of losing ground to their biggest rival in East Asia, held back by older subs. Meanwhile, China is maintaining a rapid and intentional advancement, threatening complete dominance of the surrounding seas, with impressive naval hardware technology. We can only hope future conflicts can be averted, but the balance of power in the region could tip towards China's favor, lest the U.S. optimize its fleet faster as old subs age out. Beyond that, having enough crew has been an issue for American submarine fleets, with a drop in numbers post-pandemic. However, working with the Australian Navy, to help them expand operational capabilities, 50 nuclear-trained operators have recently graduated. Despite working with allies, the U.S. faces a distinct challenge against the sheer volume of Chinese forces, as they now claim the largest maritime fighting force in the world.",

      "text": "How Many Aircraft Carriers Does China Have?\nWhen most people think of aircraft carriers, they likely picture the United States Navy's sizeable fleet of 11 active nuclear carriers. The current model in production, the Gerald R. Ford-class, entered service in 2017. While it's true that the U.S. gets a lot of press for its impressive carriers, it's not the only nation that has them. Other nations, such as China, France, India, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Russia, also operate aircraft carriers, although they collectively have just as many as the U.S.\nGranted, China and other nations also have helicopter carriers, though these are very different from traditional aircraft carriers. Next to the U.S., China boasts the largest fleet of flat tops, and it's growing much faster than any other nation. As of mid-2025, China has a fleet of three aircraft carriers, boasting a variety of improvements over previous models operated by other nations. This is important because, before China built its current fleet of carriers, it purchased them from outside the country, and 13 years ago, China had no carriers in its fleet.\nChina's current carriers include a refitted Soviet-era ship, the Type 001 Liaoning, which was finally commissioned into the People's Liberation Army Navy in 2012. Its second aircraft carrier, the Type 002 Shandong, is the first domestically produced carrier in the Navy's fleet. China commissioned it in December 2019. Finally, China's third vessel, the Type 003 Fujian, is a completely redesigned vessel and the largest in China's fleet, though it's smaller than Ford-class carriers. It began sea trials in 2024.\nThe People's Liberation Army Navy's aircraft carriers\nWhile it would be disingenuous to compare the USS Gerald R. Ford to the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning, that doesn't mean China's first carrier isn't a good warship. It has been modernized, but its displacement of 60,000 tons of seawater places it far behind the Ford's 100,000 tons. The same is true of the Shandong, which is also a modern vessel that's considerably smaller than the best the U.S. has to offer. Granted, size isn't everything, as an aircraft carrier is only as good as the planes it launches and recovers via its catapult system.\nChina employed a short take-off but arrested recovery (STOBAR) system in its first two carriers, but installed a catapult-assisted take-off but arrested recovery (CATOBAR) system in the Fujian. None of the three vessels are powered by nuclear reactors. Instead, they use conventional steam turbines with diesel generators. While China is working on completing the Type 003, which is expected to enter service in 2026, it's already designing a replacement, the Type 004.\nUnlike the previous three, the Type 004 will be powered by nuclear propulsion. While the technology is prevalent in the U.S., China began redesigning its nuclear-powered efforts in 2024 with the development of a new land-based prototype before moving on to the real thing. Ultimately, China aims to have six active carriers by 2035, and given the speed at which it has made its current fleet available, that appears to be a realistic goal."

      "text": "The US Navy's Submarine Fleet Is Bigger Than You Think\nThanks to movies like \"Crimson Tide,\" when most people think of the United States Navy's submarine force, they remember the Ohio-class submarines. While Ohio-class subs make up a portion of the submarine force, they're hardly the most used subs in the service. There are currently four classes of submarines in the Navy, and they vary in function, from fast attack to various types of missile submarines.\nThe U.S. Navy's submarine force currently consists of 71 submarines. These days, all of the United States' submarines are nuclear-powered, having stopped using diesel-powered subs with the retirement of the USS Dolphin (AGSS-555) in 2007. This makes it possible for a sub to operate for as long as needed, and they only need to return to port to add provisions or transfer personnel, and means that a U.S. submarine can stay submerged for months at a time.\nIn terms of missions, the various submarines that make up the fleet undertake a variety of operations. Some remain hidden beneath the waves to be used in the event of nuclear war, while others patrol the world's oceans, looking for potential targets while ideally remaining undetected. The 71 submarines in the fleet are operated by thousands of submariners, and every one of them serves a vital function in the U.S. military's global operations. These are the boats upon which they serve.\nLos Angeles-class fast attack submarines\nThe U.S. Navy's fleet of Los Angeles-class fast attack submarines (SSN) has been the backbone of the submarine fleet for decades. The now decommissioned USS Los Angeles (SSN-688), the first of its kind, was commissioned in 1976, and over the life of the program, the Navy operated 62, though only 25 remain in service. They make up more than half of the fast attack submarine fleet, and each one is named after an American city.\nLos Angeles-class submarines are powered by a nuclear reactor that propels the vessel to a maximum speed of 25 knots (29 mph). They require refueling after around 10 years and are manned by 16 officers and 127 enlisted personnel. In terms of armaments, each sub features four 21-inch torpedo tubes, Tomahawk land attack missiles, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, and a complement of deep-water anti-submarine mines. Like other Navy vessels, Los Angeles-class subs have undergone massive refits and redesigns for modernization.\nUpgraded models feature 12 vertical launching system tubes to fire Tomahawk missiles at targets up to 1,500 miles, so the subs are deadly on both land and sea. Los Angeles-class submarines were built for one purpose: to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union. While the threat never fully manifested, Los Angeles-class submarines have taken part in U.S. military operations around the globe. Due to their age, the Navy is actively replacing its aged fleet of Los Angeles-class subs with newer Virginia-class submarines.\nOhio-class ballistic missile and guided missile submarines\nThe Ohio-class submarine is one of the most important in the fleet, as it's responsible for delivering nuclear missiles to targets anywhere in the world. Hopefully, that will never happen, but having Ohio-class submarines as part of the Nuclear Triad and a deterrent to outside aggression makes them the best unused weapons in the U.S. arsenal. The Navy initially planned for 24 vessels but stopped with 18, all of which remain in service.\nOf the 18 Ohio-class submarines, 14 carry 24 Trident II intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). Each missile is capable of carrying up to eight nuclear warheads of varying yields with a range of up to 7,100 miles, though various sources note different ranges. The USS Ohio (SSGN-726) was the first to be commissioned in November 1981, and it remains active to this day. There are two types of Ohio-class submarines based on their configuration. There are 14 guided-missile submarines (SSBN) that carry nuclear weapons, and four ballistic missile submarines (SSGN).\nThe Navy's fleet of SSGNs is configured to carry cruise missiles instead of ICBMs. Each sub carries 154 Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles, and 22 are loaded into the sub's launch tubes for immediate use whenever necessary. Technically, SSGNs are still capable of carrying and firing ICBMs, but they aren't utilized for that purpose. Instead, they function as land-attack platforms with an extensive stand-off distance, making them lethal while remaining safe at sea.\nSeawolf-class fast attack submarines\nThe Seawolf-class submarine fleet is the smallest in the Navy's inventory, with only three boats having been built. Initially, 29 were ordered, but the Navy canceled the program due to the end of the Cold War. All three remain active fast attack submarines (SSN) operating in the world's oceans today. The USS Seawolf (SSN-21) was commissioned in July 1997 and was assigned to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet.\nSeawolf-class submarines are fast, achieving a maximum speed of 35 knots (40 mph), so they're not called \"fast attack submarines\" for nothing. Each sub is outfitted with a nuclear reactor, and they're manned by 14 officers and 126 enlisted personnel. Seawolf-class subs may not have gone into mass production, but they changed submarine warfare via their speed and stealth. In terms of armaments, each sub features eight 26\" torpedo tubes, Tomahawk land attack missiles, anti-ship missiles, and guided torpedoes.\nOne of the three Seawolf-class submarines, the USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23), is unlike the others. The Carter is around 100 feet longer than its sister boats, allowing for the insertion of the Multi-Mission Platform. This enables the sub to launch remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROV) operated by Navy SEALs on clandestine missions. The modification cost $887 million and likely made it possible for the Carter to tap undersea fiber optic cables, making it the only vessel capable of doing so.\nVirginia-class fast attack submarines\nThe Virginia-class fast attack submarine is the newest model in the Navy's undersea fleet. Virginia-class boats were designed to be smaller and faster than their predecessors, which they're actively replacing in the inventory. As of mid-2024, 22 Virginia-class submarines have entered into active service. The Navy has more on the way, with ten under construction and an additional four on order. Once they enter service, Virginia-class submarines will make up the bulk of the Navy's submarine fleet.\nThe USS Virginia (SSN-774) was commissioned in October 2004, and the Virginia class became the most technologically advanced ever constructed. Virginia-class subs move through the water at over 25 knots (28.7 mph), powered by its nuclear reactor. The boat's complement consists of 15 officers and 120 enlisted personnel. There are five blocks with varying armaments, with the newest, Block V, featuring 12 tubes for Tomahawk cruise missiles and four 21\" torpedo tubes, planned for future boats.\nIn total, a Virginia-class submarine can carry between 25 and 65 torpedoes and missiles, each of which makes the vessel incredibly lethal in undersea warfare. Virginia-class submarines' nuclear reactors output a ton of energy (30 megawatts), and future plans may incorporate the addition of a high-energy laser weapon on the periscope mast capable of emitting a beam powered to 300-500 kilowatts. Should this be incorporated, the laser will likely function as a defense against aircraft, though it's unclear when \u2014 or if \u2014 this will happen.\n[Featured image by U.S. Navy via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | Public Domain]"

      "text": "This is the first story of a two-part series on how the U.S. submarine force is participating in the trilateral AUKUS alliance. Click here to read the second story.\nABOARD THE SUBMARINE DELAWARE OFF FLORIDA\u2019S COAST \u2014 The attack submarine Delaware silently pulled away from the pier at Port Everglades, past the pleasure craft and the cargo ships, and then sank beneath the waves.\nThe U.S. Navy\u2019s Virginia-class submarine was showing off for VIPs on board, performing \u201cangles and dangles\u201d \u2014 diving sharply and listening for anything not safely stowed to go tumbling \u2014 piping simulated targets into its combat system, and taking simulated torpedo shots at the imaginary surface ships.\nThough the April 4 demonstration is a far cry from the complex training Delaware\u2019s crew will conduct later this year ahead of the boat\u2019s deployment to U.S. European Command\u2019s theater, leaders said any at-sea opportunity benefits the crew.\nBut the need for at-sea time butts up against a problematic reality for the Navy: It has 49 attack submarines, despite a formal requirement for 66.\nThe fleet size has remained stagnant for at least a decade, even as demand for these stealthy forces increased. Attack submarines would be pivotal in a conflict against China. They\u2019re also in high demand within the European theater in order to counter Russia\u2019s sophisticated submarine fleet. And they\u2019ve even made history in the Middle East, with the Virginia-class sub John Warner becoming the first in its class to fire Tomahawk missiles in combat during a 2018 strike on Syrian chemical weapons facilities.\nThe situation will worsen before it improves, according to the Navy\u2019s long-range shipbuilding and fleet inventory plan, which shows the force dipping to 47 later this decade before hovering in the mid-50s for many years. The fleet isn\u2019t projected to hit 66 until 2054, well beyond the \u201cdecade of concern\u201d \u2014 when military officials say the threat of conflict with China will peak.\nFurthermore, the U.S. Navy intends to sell at least three, and as many as five, of these attack submarines to Australia as part of the trilateral AUKUS pact that also involves the U.K.\nStill, Vice Adm. Rob Gaucher said that, perhaps counterintuitively, selling the submarines to Australia will help the strapped undersea fleet.\nBy delivering the boats to an ally who will operate them in coordination with American boats, \u201cwe get more submarines far forward. We get a port that gives us access\u201d to the Indo-Pacific region, the commander of naval submarine forces said during a panel at the Sea-Air-Space conference in April.\n\u201cWe get the opportunity to leverage an ally who can help us with manning and operating. We get surge capacity because now I have another area [where] I can do maintenance.\u201d\nCrewing and maintenance woes\nGaucher told Defense News the submarine fleet faces two vexing problems today and into the coming years: crewing and maintenance. But bringing Australia into the fold could help with both.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the submarine force stepped back from recruiting. More broadly, as the Navy\u2019s overall crewing levels have been tight, the force opted to focus on operations at sea rather than recruiting ashore.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put a focus back on that,\u201d Gaucher said, though he declined to discuss the size of the submarine force and to quantify its shortfall. But already \u201cwe feel the impact of that recruiting shortfall.\u201d\nOffsetting that will be Australia\u2019s growing nuclear-trained submarine force, as the nation builds a cadre of sailors and officers who will crew its Virginia-class submarines in the 2030s and its SSN-AUKUS boats in the 2040s.\nThe U.S. has already graduated the first Australian naval officers from nuclear power school. Gaucher said during the panel discussion that, by the end of this year, the Navy would graduate about 50 nuclear-trained operators and another 50 submarine combat operators. Those numbers are expected to grow in the coming years.\nGaucher told Defense News these sailors will train on American submarines for the rest of this decade, increasing the number of individuals qualified to stand watch on American boats, which in turn produces some flexibility in crewing.\nSimilarly, the submarine force is strapped for maintenance capacity. Getting boats out of maintenance on time is Gaucher\u2019s top focus, but it\u2019s an issue across the Navy and won\u2019t be fully achieved until perhaps 2027 or 2028, service officials have said.\nHowever, around 2027 the Navy will begin operating as many as four Virginia-class subs out of the HMAS Stirling submarine base in Western Australia, with local personnel conducting routine maintenance on the boats as they grow their repair capacity. That will reduce pressure on the maintenance system back at home, Gaucher said.\nBryan Clark, director of the Hudson Institute think tank\u2019s Center for Defense Concepts and Technology, told Defense News that offloading four subs\u2019 worth of routine maintenance to HMAS Stirling will ease the pressure on the Navy\u2019s Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility in Washington state, allowing the workforce there to more quickly get other subs through refits and overhauls.\nWhile there are typically concerns about sending surface ship repair work overseas, Clark said the Navy and its industry partners, General Dynamics\u2019 Electric Boat and HII\u2019s Newport News Shipbuilding, simply do not have enough capacity for all the needed submarine repairs.\nA 50-sub force in a 66-sub world\nA 2016 Navy force structure assessment called for 66 attack submarines. That requirement has remained steady since \u2014 and the fleet size has also remained steady around 50, despite a number of efforts meant to help grow it, including extending the lives of older Los Angeles-class attack subs and pouring billions of dollars into the submarine-building industry to increase output.\nWith 50 boats, \u201cwe\u2019re able to realistically meet what we\u2019ve traditionally met in our global force management,\u201d Gaucher said. But \u201cif you ask me if I want more submarines, of course. And there\u2019s never going to be enough.\u201d\nToday, it takes everything going right \u2014 a submarine coming out of maintenance on time and not unexpectedly having to surge forward for an overseas mission \u2014 for a submarine crew to get the desired number of training days.\nBut, Gaucher said, \u201cif you throw a perturbation into that \u2026 that\u2019s where you have to make those trades.\u201d\nCurrently, some submarines are on routine deployments for which they fully planned, trained and certified.\nOther boats are considered \u201ccombat surge ready\u201d and are eligible to scramble into theater if needed. These boats are trained and certified to a smaller number of core missions, but may not qualify for the full range of tasks a routine deployment could require.\nA larger fleet would mean more boats on routine deployments and fewer scrambling to surge. It would mean satisfying more requests by combatant commanders and having more boats already forward in theater \u2014 rather than the surge boats at home taking perhaps a week to prepare for deployment before traveling.\nIt would also allow the boats at home to further develop tactics as well as train alongside surface, aviation and special operations forces, rather than potentially surging forward for an overseas mission.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just really countless things you can do if you have more,\u201d Gaucher said. \u201cBut we can still get the core things done. ... So we pick the best things for those submarines to do that best satisfy what the combatant commanders need us to do.\u201d\nClark, however, said his team at Hudson is wrapping up a 2045 fleet design study for the Navy that will call for 54 attack submarines. The study will contend the service needs a larger fleet of attack submarines to address the most vexing operational problem: a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\nBut increased development of unmanned systems, including the Replicator initiative at the Pentagon and the Hellscape effort through U.S. Pacific Fleet, could help deter or stop an attack, as well as reduce the need for crewed attack submarines.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re aiming for [54] submarines in 2045, then you can get away with selling three to Australia, and the net benefit is positive because you\u2019re bolstering the alliance,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThree submarines, now somebody else is paying for the maintenance, manning them, sustaining them, and the U.S. benefits from them being out there as part of the alliance force.\u201d\n\u2018Continuously ready\u2019\nThe top officer on the attack sub Delaware, Cmdr. Rob Low, said having an in-demand asset as part of an insufficiently sized fleet weighs on him.\nSpeaking to Defense News during the April embark, Low said the deployment rotation is the same today as it was when he was a junior officer, but that submarines are more often called to surge. As a result, there\u2019s now a greater need to be \u201ca lot more focused on making sure we\u2019re continuously ready.\u201d\n\u201cWe all know that there\u2019s not a lot of backup if we have a problem. So we really pride ourselves on making sure we\u2019re material-ready to be in mission at any moment,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the second we have something that\u2019s minor break on board, we immediately go into repair mode to make sure that the second we pull [into port in Groton, Connecticut], it\u2019s not going to impact us in our ability to get deployed if we needed to at any moment.\u201d\nThis hyperfocus on readiness extends to the crew. Low said crew members have been receptive to cross-training, even teaching the nuclear-trained operators to stand watch at the sonar or fire control console in the control room \u201cso that if I end up having a shortage in one rate, I can move people around and continue to operate without any problems.\u201d\nLow said he has trained his junior sailors to the maximum qualification point allowed, with junior sailors sometimes standing watches that are normally reserved for chief petty officers. This allows the chiefs to focus on mentoring and developing junior sailors, even as the watch bills are still filled with fully qualified personnel.\nLow also noted he empowered his senior enlisted sailors to have \u201cownership of material\u201d and run the sub\u2019s machinery with little oversight from officers. This frees up his officers to focus on tactics, which Low said is vital given the strategic competition the U.S. Navy is in with Russia and China.\nIn the immediate term, Low is focused on getting his boat ready for deployment: He and the crew will continue training at sea, come in for two remaining maintenance periods, go through full training and qualifications, and then head to European waters later this year.\nBut the operating environment and the risk of a surge deployment remain on his mind.\n\u201cWe have to be ready,\u201d he said. \u201cThree weeks from now, we can be sent to someplace, and we have to be completely ready.\u201d\nThis is the first story of a two-part series on how the U.S. submarine force is participating in the trilateral AUKUS alliance.

      "text": "China's Most Advanced Nuclear Submarine: The Type 094\nChina's Type 094, known to NATO as the Jin-class, represents the backbone of the country's sea-based nuclear deterrent. The People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) currently operates at least six of these submarines, each designed to carry 12 JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (of which there are many types). With ranges reaching up to 9,000 kilometers (5,600 miles), these missiles can threaten territories like Hawaii and Alaska from the relative safety of Chinese coastal waters. This strategic reach marks a significant step forward from China's older, less reliable Xia-class subs, which were plagued by noise and reactor issues.\nThe Type 094's improved design and capabilities give Beijing a credible second-strike option in any potential nuclear conflict, making it a vital piece of China's nuclear triad (which is quite similar to its American counterpart). Despite its importance, however, the Type 094 still faces challenges that limit its stealth capabilities. Nevertheless, it remains central to China's growing blue-water ambitions, underscoring the PLAN's drive to modernize and project power.\nStrengths and shortcomings\nThe Type 094 submarine's biggest leap over its predecessor is its ability to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles from underwater, giving China a new level of deterrence. Early models of the Type 094 can fire JL-2 missiles, each armed with a single warhead. More recent variants, such as the Type 094A, are believed to be equipped with the more advanced JL-2A missile, possibly extending their strike range to include the entire U.S. mainland. However, despite these advances, the Jin-class submarines are still noisy compared to Western and Russian designs, making them easier to detect.\nReports suggest they produce noise levels comparable to older Soviet Delta-class subs, undermining their stealth and increasing their vulnerability during patrols. This acoustic challenge means that while the Type 094 can patrol the South China Sea and beyond, it may struggle to operate undetected in open-ocean scenarios against advanced anti-submarine forces. This is exacerbated by the fact that it's one of the biggest military submarines ever made. Even with these limitations, the Type 094's presence compels adversaries to devote resources to tracking and countering them.\nLooking ahead\nChina is actively addressing the Type 094's shortcomings by developing the quieter and more advanced Type 096 submarine. The new class, expected to carry the JL-3 missile, would allow China to strike targets across the continental United States from its home waters, reducing the need for dangerous open-ocean transits. Until then, the Type 094 continues to serve as the PLAN's only operational ballistic missile submarine class. As China modernizes its submarine fleet, it's clear that the Type 094 is a stepping stone to greater undersea capability.\nFor now, the Jin-class remains China's most advanced operational nuclear submarine, playing a pivotal role in Beijing's strategy of strategic deterrence and power projection. Despite technical challenges and international scrutiny, the Type 094 embodies China's determination to build a robust, survivable nuclear force. Whether this class ultimately meets China's deterrence goals or proves too noisy to be effective will depend on how well future upgrades can improve its stealth and combat readiness."

  "argos_summary": "China\u2019s nuclear submarine fleet, mainly the Type 094 Jin\u2011class, totals around 12 boats and carries JL\u20112 missiles with ranges up to 5,600 miles, giving Beijing a credible second\u2011strike capability, though the subs are noisy and less stealthy than Western designs. The U.S. Navy operates a larger, all\u2011nuclear fleet of 71 submarines, including 14 ballistic\u2011missile SSBNs, 53 attack subs, and four guided\u2011missile subs, with plans to retire Ohio\u2011class boats and introduce Columbia\u2011class and more Virginia\u2011class submarines, while also selling some to Australia under AUKUS. China has three conventional aircraft carriers (Liaoning, Shandong, Fujian) and aims for a nuclear\u2011powered Type\u202f004 by 2035, whereas the U.S. maintains 11 nuclear carriers. The U.S. faces crewing and maintenance challenges that limit its attack submarine force to about 50 boats, below the 66\u2011boat requirement, prompting plans to sell submarines to allies and expand overseas maintenance facilities. Overall, both powers are expanding and modernizing their undersea and carrier capabilities amid rising tensions in the Indo\u2011Pacific.",
