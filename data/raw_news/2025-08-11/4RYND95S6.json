One of the properties is in need of a total refurbishment, while the others are in a 'habitable condition' but need 'sprucing up'.\n\u00a3450,000 will buy you eight terraced cottages (above) on a residential street, compared to a one-bedroom terraced house in London\nThe properties were used as former homes for employees who worked up the road at Nelson Mill, which was closed in 1952\nHowever, a twist in the sales conditions means the reserve of all eight of the cottages - between \u00a340k and \u00a360k - must be met. If all but one aren't met then none of the cottages will be sold.\nEdward Feather, associate director of Pugh Auction, said: 'Seven of the cottages are habitable but all of them need updating and one of them (lot 70) needs total refurbishment.'\nIn 1861 Nelson Mill's first building was built and within 10 years it built a second. By 1891 it was operating 83,000 spindle.\nJust over 90 years since it built its first factory the mill was closed as a cotton mill in 1952 and the second mill was knocked down in the 1960s.\nSeven of the mill cottages are habitable (living room pictured above) but may need sprucing up, while one will need to be refurbished\nThe cottages in Gaskell Street, Bolton, have bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchens (above) with a cooker and washing machine\nIn 1985 it was taken over by Hargreaves and Hamilton, who are still at the site today and offer nationwide machining support for commercial installations.\nThe bargain properties up for grabs have been described as perfect for investors or first-time buyers who want to get on the property ladder and start from scratch.\nWith a minimalist decor, buyers are being encouraged to create their dream home from the get-go.\n'The row of cottages is close to Chorley Old Road which is a busy residential area with shop and lots of facilities,' Mr Feather added.\nIt is a condition of sale that all eight properties need to meet their individual reserves for sales of any of the properties to take place. Pictured above is one of the cottages bathrooms with a bath, toilet and sink\nThe cottages (above) reserve prices range from \u00a340,000 to \u00a360,000 and the total guide price for all eight properties is \u00a3450,000 - the same as a one-bedroom apartment in London\nBuyers who are looking for a suitable family home are in luck with Gaskell Community Primary School, which was recently rated Good by Ofsted, directly opposite the properties, and Thomasson Park nearby for the children.\nAn online auction opens for bids on Tuesday, October 19, and closes the following day, with potential bidders being advised to stay in the north and use any remaining money you'd save on renovating their new home.\nMr Feather added: 'While the eight cottages are being offered individually, it\u2019s a condition of sale that all eight properties need to meet their individual reserves for sales of any of the properties to take place.\n'If any of the eight properties do not meet their reserve then none of the properties will be sold, regardless of whether their reserves have been met or not.\n'The reserve prices range from \u00a340,000 to \u00a360,000 and the total guide price for all eight properties is \u00a3450,000.'\nPeople can bid for the Bolton properties (above), which will cost around \u00a340,000 to \u00a360,000, from Tuesday, October 19 until Wednesday, October 20\nBuyers are being told the row of Bolton properties (above) are perfect for first-time buyers and money saved from not heading down south can be used on renovating the cottages\nEight for the price of one: A one-bedroom terraced house in Hamble Street, Fulham, South East London, (pictured above) costs the same as eight cottages in Gaskell Street, Bolton\nThe inside of a one-bedroom terraced house in Hamble Street, Fulham, (above), with and open plan living room and kitchen, will set someone back \u00a3450,000\nThe clean look property in Fulham (above) comes with a walk-in shower, ceramic sink and toilet in the bathroom, but will cost the same as eight cottages in Bolton\nMost watched News videos\n- Moment passengers 'stop' man who pulled down trousers on tube\n- Moment Cycling Mikey pushes bike into a car after furious row\n- Kristen Welker calls out JB Pritzker over Gerrymandering\n- Shocking moment woman strikes flight attendant before being removed\n- Shocking moment man is gored to death after charging at bull\n- Family-friendly restaurant Cracker Barrel unveils bold new look\n- Chinese navy vessel collides with one of its own chasing Philippine boat\n- Moment 'dine and dashers' run out on \u00a3200 bill at Indian restaurant\n- Chinese Navy ship collides with own vessel while chasing boat\n- Hawaii ferry is tossed by strong waves before being run aground\n- Florida man knocks out kayakers while attempting a DAREDEVIL leap\n- Father of children mowed down in Oatlands tragedy confronts killer\nThere are of course many homes in Bolton costing m...\nby Robert 161"
