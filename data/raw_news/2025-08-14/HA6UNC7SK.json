  "title": "Is Your Labubu Actually a Lafufu? Here's How to Tell",
  "description": "The Labubu craze has led to a counterfeit market. Some have been labeled as dangerous. Luckily there are some easy ways to spot a Lafufu.",
  "content": "Labubu dolls are the latest toy craze to captivate adults and children alike. Although Chinese toy distributor Pop Mart bought Labubu\u2019s IP in 2019, the toy didn\u2019t make its mark until it reached virality in the beginning of this year. Labubus are cheap to produce and normally retail for just $15. But supply and demand has created an environment that makes getting an authentic one almost impossible for most fans. So casual consumers and confused parents have turned to purchasing counterfeit Labubus, for themselves and their children, affectionately nicknamed Lafufus.\n\nMany social media creators embrace their Lafufus, which range from indistinguishable to obvious. Some Lafufus have become so distinctive that they are widely sought after by fans of the real thing. But could these so-called harmless fakes actually be detrimental to your health? Turns out Lafufus pose numerous health risks to both children and adults. Britain\u2019s Chartered Trading Standards Institute has seized thousands of Lafufus across the U.K. In a news release, they stated, \u201cCounterfeit Labubu dolls are poorly made and unsafe. Many contain small, detachable parts such as eyes, hands, and feet, which present a serious choking hazard to young children. Loose stitching and exposed stuffing further increase the risk of suffocation.\u201d Even adult participants of the Labubu craze can be affected by the lack of regulation in the Lafufu market, the CTSI stating, \u201cWithout proper safety checks, they may also contain toxic substances such as lead, harmful dyes, or banned plasticisers.\u201d\n\nOutside of material risks, obtaining your Labubu can be an equally dangerous ordeal. Pop Mart recently had to halt sales of Labubu dolls in the U.K. after reports of violent in-store brawls. CNN reports that Chinese customs officials have seized many thousands of copycat Labubus intended to be exported, and in southern California, $30,000 worth of stolen dolls were recovered, unrelated to an incident in which $7,000 worth of Labubu merchandise was stolen from a store in Los Angeles. For those who need their fix and want to purchase a Labubu without taking too many risks, the CTSI has a few tips on identifying a genuine Labubu doll. These include identifying marks such \u201cas a holographic POP MART sticker, a scannable QR code linking to the official Pop Mart website, and \u2013 on newer editions \u2013 a subtle UV stamp on one foot. Signs of a fake include overly vibrant colours and an incorrect teeth count, with authentic Labubus having nine. These markers are commonly missing or poorly replicated on counterfeit versions.\u201d",

      "text": "News\nCTSI issues warning about dangerous fake \u2018Labubu dolls\u2019 flooding UK market\nPosted 13/08/25\nThe Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) is issuing an urgent warning about the growing number of counterfeit \u201cLabubu\u201d dolls being sold in the UK. The viral plush toys \u2013 quirky fang-toothed \u201cmonster elf\u201d figures made popular by Chinese toymaker Pop Mart \u2013 have become a global collector\u2019s craze. This popularity has fuelled a surge in fakes, many being sold by third-party sellers via online marketplaces and local shops that are breaking the law.\nTrading Standards teams have seized thousands of unsafe counterfeit Labubu dolls in recent weeks. In just one month, over 2,000 were confiscated from 13 retailers in North Tyneside, with further seizures in Greater Manchester, Humberside, North Somerset, and Scotland. Many of these items were discovered after tip-offs from concerned parents.\nCounterfeit Labubu dolls are poorly made and unsafe. Many contain small, detachable parts such as eyes, hands, and feet, which present a serious choking hazard to young children. Loose stitching and exposed stuffing further increase the risk of suffocation.\nThese fakes often breach the UK\u2019s Toys (Safety) Regulations 2011, lacking CE or UKCA safety markings, importer details, and required safety warnings. Without proper safety checks, they may also contain toxic substances such as lead, harmful dyes, or banned plasticisers.\nGenuine Pop Mart Labubu dolls have a distinctive elf-like design and include authenticity features such as a holographic POP MART sticker, a scannable QR code linking to the official Pop Mart website, and - on newer editions - a subtle UV stamp on one foot. Signs of a fake include overly vibrant colours and an incorrect teeth count, with authentic Labubus having nine. These markers are commonly missing or poorly replicated on counterfeit versions.\nKerry Nicol, External Affairs Manager at CTSI, said: \u201cThese dolls are fast becoming the latest must have craze, which is being amplified by social media influencers promoting and showcasing \u2018unboxing\u2019 of the products on platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. Supply and demand means that legitimate Labubu dolls are almost impossible to find.\n\u201cParents understandably want to be able to get their hands on these toys for their children and rightly expect the toys they buy to be safe, but dangerous counterfeits are finding their way into the market, often being sold by third-party sellers on online marketplaces and from shops on the highstreet that have no regard for the safety of their customers.\n\u201cThese fake products bypass the rigorous safety checks and compliance requirements the law demands, meaning they could contain choking hazards, toxic materials, or faulty components that put children at serious risk. Everyone involved in the supply chain \u2013 from manufacturers and fulfilment houses to sellers and marketplaces should have a role to play in ensuring unsafe toys never reach the hands of children.\u201d\nChristine Heemskerk, CTSI Lead Officer for Product Safety, said: Fake dolls are poorly made in unsafe manufacturing premises.. Counterfeiters do not follow safety standards and are unlikely to have good factory controls in place. A fake Labubu doll might contain hazardous chemicals in the plastic which can cause lifetime damage to a child's organs. Small parts such as eyes could easily detach.posing a serious choking hazard for small children. Beware of putting your child at risk by buying cheap unsafe fakes.\nJerry Burnie, Head of Toy Safety at British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA), said: \u201cCounterfeit toys are a significant risk as they are unlikely to meet the strict toy safety standards required of the legitimate toy maker. When shopping for branded items we would always recommend researching the toy brand and try to buy from the company directly or through a reputable retailer who you can easily return the product to. If you are buying online, particularly through an online marketplace, then include the name of the toy company in the search and compare the listing against the toy company\u2019s own website.\u201d\nCTSI advises consumers to:\n- Inspect packaging carefully \u2013 check for a UKCA or CE mark, and make sure the product lists a UK-based importer or manufacturer. Warnings and usage instructions should be present.\n- Look for authenticity markers \u2013 genuine Pop Mart Labubu dolls feature a holographic sticker, a scannable QR code linking to the official Pop Mart website, and (on newer editions) a UV stamp on one foot.\n- Check the product\u2019s appearance \u2013 overly vibrant colours, poor stitching, or the wrong number of teeth (authentic Labubus have nine) are signs of a fake.\n- Be cautious of \u201cbargains\u201d \u2013 counterfeit toys are often cheaper but may carry serious safety risks, including choking hazards and toxic materials.\n- Buy from reputable retailers and avoid unfamiliar online vendors or third-party sellers on online marketplaces listings.\nCTSI is looking at counterfeit goods as part of a wider campaign as the manufacturing and sale of these products is often linked to wider organised crime groups.\nIf members of the public are concerned or would like advice, they can contact the Citizens Advice Consumer Helpline on 0808 223 1133 (England and Wales). In Scotland, contact Advice Direct Scotland on 0808 164 6000, or for Northern Ireland call Consumerline on 0300 123 6262.\nImage: Fake Labubu doll seized by Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council Trading Standards Team.\nENDS\nChartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI)\nThe Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) is a national not for profit established in 1881 which supports the UK\u2019s Trading Standards profession and works to protect consumers and safeguard honest businesses.

The department said the suspects used a stolen Toyota Tacoma in the incident, which was recovered shortly afterward. The agency said it was investigating the case and did not have additional information.\nLabubu dolls, created by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung, have become a popular collectible item a decade after the toothy monsters were first introduced.\nToy vendor One Stop Sales said in an Instagram post that the thieves took all of the store\u2019s inventory and trashed the establishment. The store posted surveillance footage showing a group of people wearing hoodies and face coverings breaking in. The suspects are seen shuffling through items and carrying boxes out of the shop.\n\u201cWe are still in shock,\u201d the store said in its post, urging people to help find the thieves.\n___\nThis story has been updated to correct the store\u2019s name. It is One Stop Sales, not One Stop Shop."

      "text": "Labubu, a palm-sized plush toy with sharp teeth and a cult following, has become a toy too popular to sell.\nAfter chaotic scenes of queueing, crowd surges and reported fights, distributor Pop Mart has suspended all in-store sales of the collectible across the United Kingdom.\n\u201cDue to the increasing demand for our beloved Labubus, we\u2019ve seen a significant rise in customer turnout on restock days \u2014 with long queues forming outside our stores and Roboshops (self-service stores),\u201d the Chinese-based toy company wrote in an Instagram post Tuesday.\n\u201cTo ensure the safety and comfort of everyone, we will temporarily pause all in-store and roboshop sales of THE MONSTERS plush toys until further notice.\u201d Online sales, however, will continue as usual, it added.\nLabubu is the brainchild of Hong Kong-born illustrator Kasing Lung, and it has quietly built a loyal following since its 2015 debut.\nBut in recent months, the bunny-bodied, elf-faced creature \u2014 equal parts grotesque and adorable \u2014 has soared in popularity. Stars including Rihanna, Dua Lipa, and Lisa from Blackpink have worn the toys like charms, and they were were even spotted at Paris Fashion Week this year.\nThe effect is evident in the numbers, as Pop Mart is enjoying meteoric growth both at home in China and overseas.\nIn 2024, Pop Mart\u2019s revenue outside China skyrocketed 375.2% to 5.07 billion yuan ($700 million). Labubus alone generated 3 billion yuan ($420 million) of the company\u2019s 13.04 billion yuan ($1.8 billion) total revenue last year.\nAcross TikTok, content featuring Labubus ranges from euphoric unboxings to clips of brawls outside stores. The hashtag \u201cLabubu\u201d now carries more than 1.4 million posts, and on resale platforms such as StockX the plushies are fetching hundreds of dollars, compared with a standard retail price of up to $85.\nFor some, the frenzy has tipped into absurdity.\n\u201cDon\u2019t risk your life for a Labubu,\u201d read the caption on one TikTok video from Victoria Calvert. The video \u2014 now viewed more than 100,000 times \u2014 captured the escalating chaos at a Pop Mart location in London.\n\u201cThere\u2019s people in balaclavas running to the front,\u201d she said in the video, warning others to stay away.\nCalvert told CNN that she \u201cleft pretty quickly\u201d when people \u201cstarted to shout names to each other and fight.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I realized it was a dangerous situation,\u201d she added.\nWhile some describe such scenes of chaos with a hint of disbelief, others see an upside for Pop Mart in the mayhem.\nSarah Johnson, founder and director of UK-based retail consultancy Flourish Retail, told CNN the suspension of in-store sales may be about more than just crowd control.\n\u201cPop Mart pulling Labubus from UK stores seems like a precautionary move to de-escalate the in-store frenzy and protect both their brand and customers,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAt the same time, this kind of decision keeps the product in the spotlight and adds to the sense of scarcity, which only drives further interest and attention online.\u201d\nAnd nowhere is that more visible than on TikTok, Johnson added, where \u201ca single video showing a long queue, an unboxing or someone finding a \u2018rare\u2019 item can go viral in minutes and suddenly everyone wants it.\u201d\nIn today\u2019s market, she said, \u201cTikTok has essentially become the new high street window \u2014 except it\u2019s open 24/7 and has global reach.\u201d\nA contestant from the ITV reality show \u201cLove Island\u201d revealed Tuesday that she had ended up \u201cin a fight\u201d with a woman in a shop over the sought-after plushies.\nMal Nicol said she had queued up at a London branch of Pop Mart to bag a Labubu for her 11-year-old cousin\u2019s birthday.\nBut Nicol, who has two of the toys herself, was left enraged by a customer nearby.\n\u201cThis b*tch, she bought five, she bought five. It\u2019s actually ridiculous,\u201d Nicol said on TikTok.\n\u201cDid I really just get in a fight with someone at Pop Mart? Yes, I did. Yes, I did,\u201d she said.\nCNN\u2019s Ramishah Maruf contributed to this report."

The palm-sized plushie, which has a bunny body, elf-like face and sharp teeth, is so popular that genuine versions are becoming increasingly difficult to come by.\nIn May, Pop Mart announced that it was temporarily suspending all in-store sales of the collectible across the UK following chaotic scenes of crowd surges and reported fights. Last week, thieves in the Los Angeles area broke into a store and made off with thousands of dollars worth of stock.\nThe toy\u2019s massive popularity has led to a wave of fakes, and many have been deemed unsafe, according to Britain\u2019s Chartered Trading Standards Institute.\nIn a warning it described as \u201curgent\u201d on its website, the CTSI reported that thousands of dangerous counterfeits have been seized by their teams across the country, often as a result of complaints from parents.\n\u201cCounterfeit Labubu dolls are poorly made and unsafe,\u201d the news release warned. \u201cMany contain small, detachable parts such as eyes, hands, and feet, which present a serious choking hazard to young children.

These are \u201ccommonly missing or poorly replicated\u201d on fakes, the CTSI said.\nAnother tell-tale sign can be the number of teeth. Genuine dolls have nine, while fakes may vary. Overly vibrant colors and poor stitching can also indicate the doll is not the real deal.\nKerry Nicol, external affairs manager at CTSI, said in the release that the demand has been \u201camplified\u201d by social media. \u201cSupply and demand means that legitimate Labubu dolls are almost impossible to find,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThese fake products bypass the rigorous safety checks and compliance requirements the law demands, meaning they could contain choking hazards, toxic materials, or faulty components that put children at serious risk.

  "argos_summary": "Labubu dolls, a viral toy craze, have led to a surge in counterfeit versions known as Lafufus, which pose serious health risks due to poor manufacturing standards. The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) in the UK has warned that these fakes often contain small, detachable parts that can choke children and may include toxic materials. As legitimate Labubus become increasingly difficult to find, the demand for these unsafe alternatives has risen, prompting Pop Mart to temporarily halt in-store sales in the UK amid reports of violence and theft related to the toy's popularity.",
