  "description": "Staffers at The Washington Post are on a sugar high \u2014 but not in the way their bosses may have hoped.",
  "content": "Staffers at The Washington Post are on a sugar high \u2014 but not in the way their bosses may have hoped.\n\nGlenn Kessler, The Post\u2019s famed Fact Checker, announced his departure last week after more than 27 years at the paper, revealing he had taken a buyout. His last day was July 31.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital, Kessler revealed that his final days at The Post weren\u2019t too somber \u2014 thanks to all the \u201ccaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was sugar overload because, you know, the tradition in newspapers is what we call caking, where it is a little celebration with cake served,\u201d Kessler told Fox News Digital.\n\nKessler said his colleagues held a \u201cvery nice event\u201d for him and shared kind words, including some located in Asia who woke up in the middle of the night and were \u201cbeamed in\u201d on Zoom to participate. Kessler previously served as a State Department reporter before becoming the Fact Checker.\n\nHowever, he was far from the only outgoing \u201cPostie\u201d being celebrated.\n\n\u201cBut it was literally one caking after another,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cI mean, as we walked in for my event, they were packing up the leftover cake from the previous event. And as my wife remarked, as we walked through the newsroom to the place where they were holding my event, there was literally every conference room was filled with a caking, with people celebrating people who were leaving. So it was a very strange sugar high one got on your last day.\u201d\n\nKessler let out a belly laugh at the idea that The Post was giving so much business to one lucky bakery in Washington, D.C., as he speculated all the cakes were coming from the same bakery, though he didn\u2019t know which one.\n\n\u201cBut the caking is such a newspaper clich\u00e9,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cI mean, one of my favorite movies is the movie \u2018Spotlight,\u2019 which is about The Boston Globe, and it opens with a caking. It was kind of like an inside journalism joke to open with a caking where people were eating this cake and they each have kind of awkward, strange, funny remarks that people make about the person that\u2019s leaving.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that was the last day. Caking, after caking, after caking, after caking,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Washington Post had just concluded a round of buyouts, targeting the most senior staffers. The Post, which has struggled financially in recent years, has had multiple iterations of what it calls the Voluntary Separation Program (VSP). But as Kessler noted in his Substack piece shedding light on what led to his departure, this was going to be the \u201clast buyout,\u201d according to what a senior editor told him, and that any necessary staff reductions in the future would be layoffs.\n\nBut not everyone who has left The Post in recent months was for a buyout. Many landed jobs at other news outlets while others resigned in protest over decisions made by the paper\u2019s billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos. Bezos sparked newsroom turmoil last October when he pulled The Post\u2019s forthcoming endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the presidential election. He fueled further consternation in February by launching a new mission for the editorial pages to promote \u201cpersonal liberties and free markets\u201d and vowing not to publish pieces opposing those principles.\n\nThe Post has lost a significant portion of its biggest talent and high-profile journalists over the past year, Kessler being among them. However, some departures were more painful for the newsroom.\n\nKessler cited a trio of top editors who announced their exits within a two-month span that took the biggest hit on newsroom morale; Matea Gold, The Post\u2019s managing editor who was poached by The New York Times to become its Washington editor, Philip Rucker, The Post\u2019s national editor who joined CNN as its senior vice president of editorial strategy and news, and Griff Witte, The Post\u2019s democracy editor who became The Atlantic\u2019s managing editor.\n\nGold, in particular, Kessler noted, was the one who \u201ceveryone thought should have been editor\u201d of The Post.\n\n\u201cThose three were the future leaders of The Washington Post,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cYou could imagine any one of them running the newspaper at one point. And the fact that they all left? That was devastating.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for The Washington Post declined to comment.",

      "text": "Longtime Washington Post columnist Joe Davidson quits while calling out Jeff Bezos\u2019 editorial constraints\nA longtime columnist for the Washington Post called out its billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, and the shifting editorial policies that he said forced him to quit the paper.\nJoe Davidson, who penned the Post\u2019s \u201cFederal Insider\u201d column for 17 out of his 20 years at the paper, took to his Facebook page and wrote a piece titled \u201cQuitting The Washington Post \u2014 or did it quit me?,\u201d telling readers that having the esteemed title of \u201cWashington Post columnist\u201d was not worth keeping no matter the cost.\n\u201cFor me, the cost became too great when a Federal Insider column I wrote was killed because it was deemed too opinionated under an unwritten and inconsistently enforced policy, which I had not heard of previously,\u201d Davidson wrote Tuesday. \u201cWhile the policy prohibiting opinion and commentary in News section articles can be justified journalistically, it is a departure from longstanding Post practice and mandated a change in my role that I chose not to accept.\u201d\nWhile Davidson didn\u2019t believe Bezos was directly involved in his column being killed, he wrote that \u201cit would be naive to ignore the context.\u201d\n\u201cStarting before the November presidential election, Bezos\u2019s policies and activities have projected the image of a Donald Trump supplicant,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cThe result \u2013 fleeing journalists, plummeting morale and disappearing subscriptions. Since October, when Bezos blocked publication of a planned Post endorsement of Kamala Harris for president, the departure of Post talent has been shocking and included five former editors directly above me in the newsroom\u2019s hierarchy.\n\u201cNonetheless, Post coverage of Trump remains strong. Yet the policy against opinion in News section columns means less critical scrutiny of Trump \u2014 a result coinciding with Bezos\u2019s unseemly and well-document[ed] coziness with the president.\u201d\nDavidson wrote it was a \u201cshock\u201d when the column was blocked for being \u201ctoo opinionated,\u201d insisting he had written more opinionated pieces throughout his tenure at the Post, but noted that in the piece that was killed, he argued that \u201cone hallmark of President Donald Trump\u2019s first three, turbulent months in office is his widespread, ominous attack on thought, belief and speech.\u201d\nThe piece, Davidson said, listed examples of actions taken by the Trump administration, like its efforts to deport anti-Israel activists Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk, as well as its crackdown on DEI.\n\u201cKilling that column was a death blow to my life as a Washington Post columnist. But I wrote two more articles to see if I could cope with the restrictions. That\u2019s when I learned just how severe the policy is,\u201d Davidson wrote. \u201cIn my next piece, I was not allowed to describe a potential pay raise for federal employees as \u2018well-deserved\u2019 because of Post policy.\u201d\n\u201cAs a columnist, I can\u2019t live with that level of constraint. A column without commentary made me a columnist without a column. I also was troubled by significant inconsistencies in the implementation of the policy. During this period, The Post allowed stronger, opinionated language by other staffers, including the words \u2018viciousness,\u2019 \u2018cruelty\u2019 and \u2018meanness\u2019 to describe Trump\u2019s actions,\u201d he continued.\nDavidson, who previously wrote a farewell piece to Post readers late last month, said he will continue to subscribe to the Post to support the journalism of his former colleagues but acknowledged those who \u201cunderstandably have canceled subscriptions to protest Bezos\u2019s actions that have damaged the news organization\u2019s integrity.\u201d\n\u201cWhen Bezos bought The Post, he provided needed money, energy and direction. The Post continues to produce first-rate journalism now, despite his morale-busting actions,\u201d Davidson added.\nNeither Davidson nor the Washington Post responded to Fox News Digital\u2019s requests for comment.\nOver the past year, the Washington Post was at the center of intense outrage from the left.\nThe first was in October when Bezos halted the paper\u2019s endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the November election.\nThe second was in February when Bezos announced his directive for the Post\u2019s editorial pages to promote \u201cpersonal liberties and free markets\u201d and vowed not to publish pieces opposing those principles.\nBoth instances sparked a mass exodus of paid subscribers and several resignations, including opinion editor David Shipley, who opposed Bezos\u2019 new policy.\nLast month, the Post tapped Adam O\u2019Neal, formerly of the Economist and the Wall Street Journal, to lead the opinion pages."

So many of these brave and diligent fact checkers have become good friends,\u201d Kessler wrote.\n\u201cMy fact checks were routinely the most-read articles on The Post\u2019s website. I had my detractors, from both the left and right, but many readers appreciated my efforts to sort out the truth in political rhetoric,\u201d he added.\nKessler revealed he attempted to stay on a contract basis long enough for his bosses to find a successor for a smooth transition, to no avail.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want The Post to have a gap in fact-checking coverage during this fraught period in U.S. history. But we couldn\u2019t work out an agreement,\u201d he wrote.\nWashington Post executive editor Matt Murray appeared onboard with hiring a new fact checker in an exchange with Kessler, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nKessler\u2019s next chapter will involve him writing books, and he\u2019s open to freelance and consulting work.\n\u201cIn 2018, when the Fact Checker team was compiling a database of more than 30,000 Trump claims, I told the New York Times that \u2018I have the best job in journalism,'\u201d Kessler wrote. \u201cI still believe that, and I\u2019m sorry to leave without a replacement lined up. But it\u2019s the right time for me. I hope The Post finds someone to carry on this important project.\u201d\nThe Washington Post did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment.\nMurray implemented a new round of the paper\u2019s Voluntary Separation Program (VSP) in May, hoping that most veteran staffers would be enticed by the exit offer. The program is set to end this week.\nAccording to a VSP document previously viewed by Fox News Digital, nine months of base pay would be given to staffers employed for 10-15 years, 12 months of base pay for 15-20-year veterans, 15 months of base pay for 20-25-year veterans and 18 months for anyone who has worked at the Post for more than 25 years. All of them would also receive 12 months of pay credit in their Separate Retirement Account (SRA).\nOther high-profile writers who\u2019ve taken the buyouts include columnists Jonathan Capehart, Catherine Rampell, Philip Bump and Joe Davidson.\nAlso fueling the exodus from the editorial pages was the initiative by the Post\u2019s billionaire owner Jeff Bezos to promote \u201cpersonal liberties and free markets\u201d and vowing not to publish pieces opposing those principles.\nBezos\u2019 directive, which was announced in February, led to the immediate resignation of Post opinion editor David Shipley.

      "text": "Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart quits paper after owner Jeff Bezos overhauls op-ed section: report\nWashington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart has accepted a buyout from the paper, becoming the latest high-profile departure amid sweeping editorial changes implemented under owner Jeff Bezos.\nCapehart, a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer known for his outspoken criticism of President Trump, had been with the Post since 2007. His exit was first reported by Axios on Monday.\nCapehart\u2019s final column for the Post, published in May, featured a conversation with Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison on \u201ccountering\u201d the president.\nThat same month, Capehart resigned from the newspaper\u2019s editorial board over a dispute with a white colleague about a piece that anazlyed Georgia\u2019s voting laws and their alleged racial implications.\nCapehart had previously referred to Trump as \u201ca cancer on the presidency and American society\u201d and compared a rally held by Trump at Madison Square Garden to a Nazi rally at the same venue in 1939.\nThe terms of his buyout were not disclosed.\nRepresentatives for the Washington Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCapehart will continue co-hosting MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend\u201d and remain a panelist on PBS\u2019s \u201cNewsHour.\u201d\nThe buyout follows comments made by Washington Post CEO Will Lewis, who in recent weeks urged employees who do not \u201cfeel aligned\u201d with the company\u2019s editorial direction to resign.\nHis departure adds to a string of exits at the paper over the Beltway broadsheet\u2019s shift to the right. In February, Bezos ordered the Post\u2019s opinion section to focus on \u201cpersonal liberties and free markets.\u201d\nThe directive led to the resignation of Opinion Editor David Shipley, followed by the departure of multiple other opinion writers, including longtime columnist Ruth Marcus.\nLast month, Adam O\u2019Neal, formerly of The Economist and The Dispatch, was named opinion editor.\nWeeks later, popular columnist Joe Davidson announced he was leaving after one of his columns was killed for being \u201ctoo opinionated.\u201d\nDavidson criticized the paper\u2019s ownership, stating that \u201cBezos\u2019s policies and activities have projected the image of a Donald Trump supplicant.\u201d\nThe paper faced subscriber backlash after Bezos blocked a planned endorsement of Kamala Harris for president shortly before the election. Approximately 250,000 subscribers canceled their subscriptions.\nIn January, several top reporters and editors \u2014 including Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, Josh Dawsey and Tyler Pager \u2014 left the Post for rival outlets such as The Atlantic and the New York Times.\nManaging editor Matea Gold joined the Times\u2019 Washington bureau in late 2024. At the same time, the Post laid off 4% of its business-side staff due to profitability concerns.\nEarlier this year, more than 400 staff members signed an internal petition expressing concern over editorial independence and management decisions."

      "text": "Staffers at The Washington Post are on a sugar high \u2014 but not in the way their bosses may have hoped.\nGlenn Kessler, The Post's famed Fact Checker, announced his departure last week after more than 27 years at the paper, revealing he had taken a buyout. His last day was July 31.\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital, Kessler revealed that his final days at The Post weren\u2019t too somber \u2014 thanks to all the \"caking.\"\n\"It was sugar overload because, you know, the tradition in newspapers is what we call caking, where it is a little celebration with cake served,\" Kessler told Fox News Digital.\nWASHINGTON POST REELING FROM BUYOUT EXODUS AS BOSSES HOPE TO TURN THE PAGE AT EMBATTLED PAPER\nKessler said his colleagues held a \"very nice event\" for him and shared kind words, including some located in Asia who woke up in the middle of the night and were \"beamed in\" on Zoom to participate. Kessler previously served as a State Department reporter before becoming the Fact Checker.\nHowever, he was far from the only outgoing \"Postie\" being celebrated.\n\"But it was literally one caking after another,\" Kessler said. \"I mean, as we walked in for my event, they were packing up the leftover cake from the previous event. And as my wife remarked, as we walked through the newsroom to the place where they were holding my event, there was literally every conference room was filled with a caking, with people celebrating people who were leaving. So it was a very strange sugar high one got on your last day.\"\nKessler let out a belly laugh at the idea that The Post was giving so much business to one lucky bakery in Washington, D.C., as he speculated all the cakes were coming from the same bakery, though he didn't know which one.\n\"But the caking is such a newspaper clich\u00e9,\" Kessler said. \"I mean, one of my favorite movies is the movie \u2018Spotlight,\u2019 which is about The Boston Globe, and it opens with a caking. It was kind of like an inside journalism joke to open with a caking where people were eating this cake and they each have kind of awkward, strange, funny remarks that people make about the person that's leaving.\"\n\"So that was the last day. Caking, after caking, after caking, after caking,\" he added.\nThe Washington Post had just concluded a round of buyouts, targeting the most senior staffers. The Post, which has struggled financially in recent years, has had multiple iterations of what it calls the Voluntary Separation Program (VSP). But as Kessler noted in his Substack piece shedding light on what led to his departure, this was going to be the \"last buyout,\" according to what a senior editor told him, and that any necessary staff reductions in the future would be layoffs.\nBut not everyone who has left The Post in recent months was for a buyout. Many landed jobs at other news outlets while others resigned in protest over decisions made by the paper's billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos. Bezos sparked newsroom turmoil last October when he pulled The Post's forthcoming endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the presidential election. He fueled further consternation in February by launching a new mission for the editorial pages to promote \"personal liberties and free markets\" and vowing not to publish pieces opposing those principles.\nThe Post has lost a significant portion of its biggest talent and high-profile journalists over the past year, Kessler being among them. However, some departures were more painful for the newsroom.\nWASHINGTON POST ABANDONS NEWSROOM INTEGRATION FOR ITS SOCIAL MEDIA-FOCUSED \u2018WP VENTURES\u2019 DIVISION\nKessler cited a trio of top editors who announced their exits within a two-month span that took the biggest hit on newsroom morale; Matea Gold, The Post's managing editor who was poached by The New York Times to become its Washington editor, Philip Rucker, The Post's national editor who joined CNN as its senior vice president of editorial strategy and news, and Griff Witte, The Post's democracy editor who became The Atlantic's managing editor.\nGold, in particular, Kessler noted, was the one who \"everyone thought should have been editor\" of The Post.\n\"Those three were the future leaders of The Washington Post,\" Kessler said. \"You could imagine any one of them running the newspaper at one point. And the fact that they all left? That was devastating.\"\nA spokesperson for The Washington Post declined to comment.\nFox News' Annie McCuen contributed to this report."

      "text": "Washington Post announces another buyout program targeting veteran staffers, other departments\nThe Washington Post announced Monday it was implementing another buyout program, this time targeting veteran staffers and other department employees.\n\u201cToday, we are announcing that The Washington Post is offering a Voluntary Separation Program (VSP) to news employees with 10 or more years\u2019 service at The Post, as well as to all members of the video department and to all members of the copy desk and sports copy desk,\u201d Washington Post executive editor Matt Murray wrote in a staff memo obtained by Fox News Digital.\nThe memo stated the move was part of The Washington Post\u2019s \u201congoing newsroom transformation efforts aimed at reshaping and modernizing the newsroom for the current environment.\u201d\n\u201cLike the rest of our industry, we are adapting to changing habits and new technologies that are transforming news experiences. Even as we have begun creating new departments and welcoming new colleagues, to reach new audiences we must increase our staffing flexibility and expand in areas such as audience data and social video,\u201d Murray continued.\nMurray told staff the buyout program would conclude by the end of July.\n\u201cWith the VSP, we will no doubt see valued colleagues and friends decide to leave The Post,\u201d Murray wrote.\n\u201cBut as stewards of this great institution, we all must remain relentlessly focused on bringing engaging and relevant journalism to growing numbers of readers in the formats and ways they want it in 2025. That is an urgent and important task for us given the pace of technological change, the industry\u2019s evolving landscape and the ever-present need to produce and promote strong, rigorous and independent journalism.\u201d\nAccording to a VSP document viewed by Fox News Digital, nine months of base pay would be given to staffers employed for 10-15 years, 12 months of base pay for 15-20-year veterans, 15 months of base pay for 20-25-year veterans and 18 months for anyone who has worked at the Post for more than 25 years.\nAll of them would also receive 12 months of pay credit in their Separate Retirement Account (SRA).\nOne Washington Post staffer told Fox News Digital that the new buyout program is \u201cless discerning\u201d than previous rounds of buyouts because of how widespread it is, adding that copy editors are \u201calways targets\u201d and that they\u2019re \u201calways underperticipated.\u201d\n\u201cLess important who stays or goes. Just want to get the numbers down,\u201d the staffer said.\nA spokesperson for The Washington Post told Fox News Digital, \u201cThe Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are. This voluntary program is part of our ongoing efforts aimed at reshaping how we deliver world-class news experiences and expand our reach to serve all Americans.\u201d\nThe \u201cDemocracy Dies in Darkness\u201d paper was hit with layoffs earlier this year and previously implemented buyouts in 2023.\nThe Post was reportedly expected to lose a whopping $77 million in 2024.\nThere has been an exodus of talent from the Post in recent months, including several resignations following moves made by the paper\u2019s billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, who halted the Post\u2019s endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the presidential election and his initiative announced earlier this year, ordering columns regularly defending \u201cpersonal liberties and free markets\u201d and banning viewpoints that oppose them."
