  "description": "The Ellie actor speaks out against The Last of Us criticism",
  "content": "The Last of Us star Bella Ramsey has responded to some of the second season's most vocal critics.\n\n\"I try to steer clear as much as I [can], to be honest,\" Ramsey told The Awardist podcast of the vociferous response to parts of The Last of Us season 2.\n\n\"You don't have to watch it. If you hate it that much, the game exists. You can just play the game again. If you do want to watch it, hope you enjoy it.\"\n\nCo-creator Craig Mazin is riding solo on The Last of Us season 3 after the departures of both co-creator Neil Druckmann and producer/writer Halley Gross to focus on future Naughty Dog projects. On The Awardist, Ramsey also added that Druckmann will be \"greatly missed.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s been a creative dream to work with Neil and bring an adaptation of his brilliant work to life on HBO. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a more generous creative partner,\" Mazin said in a statement.\n\nMazin \u2013 who previously gave an update on writing the third season in an interview with GamesRadar+ \u2013 has now seemingly cracked the season length. In short, it will be longer than the second season's seven episodes.\n\n\"I will say that season 3 will be longer than season 2. Season 3 will be more on par with season 1. More bang for the buck,\" Mazin told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nHBO TV chief Casey Bloys has also suggested that The Last of Us could wrap up its story with either two more seasons or \"one long season.\"\n\nFor more, jump into our guide to the new TV shows coming your way in 2025 and beyond.

      "text": "Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann is leaving HBO's The Last of Us season 3 to turn his \"complete focus\" to Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet and the studio's \"future projects\"\n\"Now is the right time for me to transition my complete focus to Naughty Dog and its future projects\"\nNeil Druckmann, the studio head of The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog, has announced he's stepping down on his leadership role in the game's HBO adaptation. Instead, he's pointing his \"complete focus\" toward Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet and other video game projects.\nThis leaves Craig Mazin as The Last of Us TV show's sole showrunner. Mazin told GamesRadar+ in April that he hadn't begun writing The Last of Us season 3, suggesting the next season of the show will play out entirely without Druckmann's input.\n\"I've made the difficult decision to step away from my creative involvement in The Last of Us on HBO,\" Druckmann said in a message shared to social media. \"With work completed on season 2 and before any meaningful work starts on season 3, now is the right time for me to transition my complete focus to Naughty Dog and its future projects, including writing and directing our exciting next game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, along with my responsibilities as Studio Head and Head of Creative.\"\nCo-running a popular HBO show and directing a AAA video game feels like kinds of things that are difficult to do all at once, though the news is sure to cause speculation given the somewhat tepid response to the recent second season of the show. Details on The Last of Us season 3 are sparse, but the show is expected to run for at least two more seasons.\n\"Co-creating the show has been a career highlight,\" Druckmann concluded. \"It's been an honor to work alongside Craig Mazin to executive produce, direct and write on the last two seasons. I'm deeply thankful for the thoughtful approach and dedication the talented cast and crew took to adapting The Last of Us Part I and the continued adaptation of The Last of Us Part II.\"\nDustin Bailey joined the GamesRadar team as a Staff Writer in May 2022, and is currently based in Missouri.

      "text": "Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet \u2013 Everything we know about the new Naughty Dog game\nAll the latest Intergalactic news and updates from the developer of The Last of Us\nIntergalactic: The Prophet is a new sci-fi action- adventure game from The Last of Us developer, Naughty Dog. Officially revealed during the Game Award 2024 showcase, which introduced us to protagonist bounty hunter, Jordan A Mun (played by Tati Gabrielle, who starred as Nora in The Last of Us season 2), the new IP promises to bring us the studios \"wildest, most creative story\" and \"deepest gameplay\" yet.\nFollowing the initial reveal trailer, we've gotten to learn a little more about the project, and as it's coming from a studio that's behind some of the best game stories around, it's already shaping up to be one of the most intriguing and exciting new games in the pipeline.\nCurrently set to arrive as a PlayStation exclusive and in development since 2020, we've brought together everything we know about this upcoming PS5 game, from details about the cast, to interviews with studio lead Neil Druckmann, and more. So, read on below to find an overview on all things Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.\nIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet release date is unknown\nNeither Naughty Dog nor PlayStation Studios has revealed the Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet release date or release window. That's likely because it is years away from production.\nThe studio has confirmed that development started on Intergalactic back in 2020. While it is true that the team typically takes around four years between projects, it's likely that the COVID-19 pandemic has created an elongated production pipeline, which is likely one reason we've seen so many remasters and remakes from the studio of late. Don't expect Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet to be a new game for 2025.\nIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet platforms\nIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is coming to PS5. Developer Naughty Dog is part of the PlayStation Studios group who sets its sights on building expansive PS5 exclusives.\nWhile it is true that select PlayStation titles have come to PC (including Naughty Dog's most recent releases and remasters of The Last of Us Part 1 and Part 2), they typically arrive years after making their debut on PlayStation platforms. There was no mention of it just yet.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nStill, you should also expect some pretty sweet PS5 Pro support, given that Naughty Dog is typically a brand leader for benchmark-setting at Sony Interactive Entertainment.\nIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet trailer\nThe Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet trailer runs for four minutes and 33 seconds, and truly sets the scene for the upcoming IP. The teaser opens with an alien language from the planet Sempiria that is translated to reveal the harrowing words: \"The suffering of generations must be endured to achieve our divine end,\" talk about ominous.\nThe trailer then cuts to our protagonist, the bounty hunter Jordan's ship. It turns out that Jordan is on her way to that planet we mentioned earlier, Sempiria, and that said planet also has rumors and dark stories surrounding it. The clip above is stunning, showing us realistic visuals of machinery and beautiful shots of space. It also even gives us a quick look at Jordan facing a robot boss with a great red sword as well.\nEverything about the new game looks phenomenal, and we can't wait to see more gameplay reveals and teasers as we head further into 2025.\nIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet gameplay\nNaughty Dog is yet to go into detail on the Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet gameplay experience, so all we really have is word from studio head Neil Druckmann. He says that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet \"is shaping up to be our wildest, most creative story yet,\" teasing that the third-person adventure will be set on the planet of Sempiria \u2013 \"a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago. In fact, anyone who's flown to it hoping to unravel its mysterious past was never heard from again.\"\nHe went on to say that Intergalactic will contain \"the deepest gameplay in Naughty Dog's history, taking our learnings from our previous franchises and pushing them beyond anything we've ever done before.\"\nBen Hanson, formerly of Game Informer, also teased that the upcoming game will be focused on the concept of \"player freedom\" during a MinnMax video about Intergalactic. Elden Ring is supposedly a massive inspiration for that concept when it comes to this game, too. This is seemingly backed by a 2023 interview with Druckmann (via journalist Gene Park).\n\"Some of the best storytelling is in gameplay and moving around the space and understanding a history of the space by just looking at it and examining it. To me, that's some of the best joy I get out of games that trust their audience to figure things out. That's the stuff I'm really intrigued by going forward,\" Druckman explains regarding his thoughts on Elden Ring.\nNow, we aren't saying that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet will be an Elden Ring clone. However, it's interesting to know that it's gameplay may be inspired by FromSoftware's mechanics involving interacting with environments and how the games' history is communicated to players.\nIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet story\nNaughty Dog is keeping the Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet story under wraps, but there is some information that we've been able to glean by studying that stunning reveal trailer. The game is set to introduce a new protagonist, Jordan A. Mun, a bounty hunter who finds themselves stranded on Sempiria \u2013 a dangerous planet that claims the lives of all who enter its orbit.\nDrawing on the stranded aspect, Druckmann says Intergalactic Heretic Prophet will not only explore faith and religion, but it will also be about being lonely as you find yourself isolated on the planet.\n\"I really wanted to make a game about faith and religion,\" Druckmann says, \"but also about just being lonely. So many of the previous games we've done \u2013 there's always, like, an ally, with you. I really want you to be lost in a place where you're really confused about what happened here.\"\nJordan is heading to the surface to claim a bounty on Colin Graves, a member of a notorious intergalactic criminal outfit called the Five Aces who terrorized the Bluestar Systems before mysteriously disappearing. It's clear from the reveal that Jordan is hunting these MIA criminals, but whether it's to lay claim to the missing loot or for more personal reasons remains to be seen.\nIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet cast\nSome of the Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet cast have been revealed so far, but a few roles still remain a mystery.\nThe title role of protagonist Jordan A. Mun is played by Tati Gabrielle, who appeared in the first season of The Last of Us as Nora Harris, and played a part in the Uncharted movie adaptation as Jo Braddock.\nTony Dolton, who Neil Druckmann said he \"immediately\" cast for a role in the upcoming sci-fi adventure following his appearance in the Last of Us tv show, is also set to appear, but we don't yet know what role he'll be playing.\nWe also know that prolific actor Troy Baker (who's had parts in the Last of Us game as Joel as well as Death Stranding and the follow-up Death Stranding 2) is also attached to the project, but we likewise are still awaiting more information about his part.\nEternals actor Kumail Nanjiani is also set to play the role of Colin Graves, who's a member of an intergalactic criminal outfit.\nIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet development\nIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is in development at Naughty Dog, the studio responsible for some of the best PS5 games (and The Last of Us and Uncharted franchises). Studio head and game director Neil Druckmann says that the team has \"been working on this brand-new adventure since 2020\", meaning that development will have commenced as production on The Last of Us 2 concluded.\nGiven the success of the HBO Last of Us adaptation, there had been some speculation that Naughty Dog would dive straight back into that world for its next project. Still, it's great to see the studio shift gears into a new IP \u2013 its first since it unleashed Joel and Ellie on an unsuspecting world a decade ago.\nHowever, it's also worth noting that the development on the game is taking time, and is still in the early stages, as ideas are still being formed and changed. In fact, Neil Druckmann recently revealed during an episode of Sony's Creator to Creator video series that the team\" still have a ways to go.\"\n\"Again, these things are so complex and big, and there's so many people involved. It's like, I still don't know exactly what this thing is going to look like at the end,\" he continued. \"I have a theory, I have an idea, but it's still evolving and changing as we're making it.\"\nHopefully, we will see progress speed up after the release of HBO's The Last of Us season 2, which comes out on April 13, 2025. Stay tuned for updates!\nWhile we wait for more info on Naughty Dog's new venture, why not dive into one of the best sci-fi games.\nJosh West is the Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar+.

The combat looks very fun from what we've seen from the trailer already, so we have high hopes that this will be a 2026 standout.\nDirective 8020\nDeveloper: Supermassive Games\nPublisher: Supermassive Games\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nUntil Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, and The Quarry developer Supermassive Games has another horror game in the works. However, this time we'll be flung into a sci-fi nightmare with a story reminiscent of classic horror movies like The Thing and Alien. In this new PS5 game, a crew wakes up from Stasis unexpectedly, only to find that their ship has been invaded by a dangerous alien that can mimic its prey. Like all other Supermassive Games experiences, the main objective is survival here, and we can't wait to see more of the title's gameplay. Originally, the game was set to release in October 2025; however, it's now been pushed to 2026. We're still waiting on a new release date, so keep your eyes peeled on this page!\nThe Blood of Dawnwalker\nDeveloper: Rebel Wolves\nPublisher: Bandai Namco Entertainment\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nDeveloped by Rebel Wolves, a new studio founded by The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, The Blood of Dawnwalker is a goth gamer's dream. It's a moody vampire RPG where you'll have to race against the clock and the sweet allure of power in order to save your family within the game's 30-day and 30-night timeframe. So far, we've only seen a cinematic trailer and a small glimpse of gameplay for this title, but everything looks fantastic so far. Fingers crossed that we have a new hit on our hands!\nJohn Carpenter's Toxic Commando\nDeveloper: In-house\nPublisher: Saber Interactive\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nIf gunning down zombies in a game co-created by a horror icon sounds like your idea of a party, boy, does John Carpenter's Toxic Commando have a surprise for you. We first caught wind of it at Summer Game Fest 2023, and the announcement trailer is suitably chaotic. From the spray of bullets raining down on legions of the undead to a decidedly out-of-tune rendition of You Give Love a Bad Name underscoring it all, this is one horde FPS game worth keeping an eye on as we await a more concrete release date.\nDenshattack!\nDeveloper: Undercoders\nPublisher: Fireshine Games\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nEver been addicted to Subway Surfers? Well, what if you could control the trains instead of avoid being hit by them? Denshattack! Is an upcoming 3D platformer where you'll have to control a cartoony, gravity-defying train as you race through levels. Face off against rivals, make allies, battle bosses, aim for high scores, and so much more with this wild but wholly unique upcoming indie game.\nPlanet of Lana 2: Children of the Leaf\nDeveloper: Wishfully\nPublisher: Thunderful Publishing\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nWishfully is set to bring us a sequel to its atmospheric cinematic adventure that released back in 2023 (check out our Planet of Lana review for more on that) with Planet of Lana 2: Children of the Leaf. With the planet not saved from strange robots that invaded the world, we'll be reuniting with protagonist Lana and her little cat-like companion Mui as they set out to uncover the world's mysterious past. From venturing through ruins to solving puzzles, and much more, the sequel promises to more challenges and a longer, deeper story.\nMortal Shell 2\nDeveloper: Cold Symmetry\nPublisher: Playstack\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nThe first Mortal Shell was pretty gnarly and goopy, a unique take on the soulslike genre that was all about butting heads with strange foes by using equally as strange powers \u2013 including hardening \u2013 switching powers to match the threat. Mortal Shell 2 dares to ask: what if things were even more metal? And there were guns? With an introductory metal song by Ben Sahar, performed by Behemoth, this is like they injected Doom straight into the original game, all flames and fury as you tear about the oddest beasts you could imagine.\nBeast of Reincarnation\nDeveloper: Game Freak\nPublisher: Fictions\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nFrom the minds that brought us Pok\u00e9mon, this new PS5 game will have us chasing a very different kind of monster. In Beast of Reincarnation, you'll play as Emma the Sealer in the year 4026. You must pursue the titular beast, which seems to be causing nature to run rampant in ways that are somewhat destructive. The game was revealed during the Xbox Games Showcase at Summer Game Fest 2025 and looks visually breathtaking. With clashing blades, a wolf companion, and a stunning world to explore, there's a lot to look forward to here.\nCode Vein 2\nDeveloper: Bandai Namco Entertainment\nPublisher: Bandai Namco Entertainment\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nThought Bloodborne was the only soulslike to load up on vampires and weird blood powers? Think again. The underrated Code Vein took a weightier, meatier, and distinctly gothic anime approach to the format. This direct sequel from Bandai Namco dials things up by adding timey elements to the mix, and even more over-the-top powers. Crunchy, weighty attacks that see your main characters transform mid-combat seem to be taking cues from the Scarlet Nexus \u2013 their more recent release \u2013 so we can expect Code Vein 2 to embrace quicker, more combo-heavy brawls while evolving the unique tone of the original.\nEnd of Abyss\nDeveloper: Section 9\nPublisher: Epic Games\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nSection 9 is bringing a spooky new isometric shooter in 2026. With goopy monsters serving a taste of The Last of Us alongside some creepy-cute animations circa Little Nightmares, End of Abyss looks like a survival horror nightmare with a sci-fi kick. The story is a little hazy at this stage aside from featuring a lot of bullets, gore, and deep space horror, but judging from the reveal trailer, this will be one for the classic survival horror fans to dig their teeth into.\nOnimusha: Way of the Sword\nDeveloper: Capcom\nPublisher: Capcom\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nIt's been years since we've had a brand new Onimusha that isn't a remaster or a VR outing. So, you can imagine our excitement when Onimusha: Way of the Sword was announced during the 2024 Game Awards. Set to release sometime in 2026, Onimusha: Way of the Sword follows the story of a samurai who wields a mysterious artifact known as the Oni Gauntlet. It's up to you to use this strange object to defeat monsters from another world called Genma. The cation will be set in Edo-era Kyoto and promises to sport plenty of dark fantasy elements. So far, the trailer looks incredible. We can't wait to learn more about this one in the future!\nSaros\nDeveloper: Housemarque\nPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nReturnal developer Housemarque returns with a new PS5 game, Saros. To clarify, this isn't a sequel to Returnal. However, it does \"build on Returnal's award-winning third-person action,\" according to the game\u2019s creative director, Gregory Louden. From the cinematic trailer that we've seen so far, Saros will follow Arjun Devraj (portrayed by Rahul Kohli), who is forced to relive the last days of a planet he is continuously fighting for his life. The game is set to release sometime in 2026, and to be honest, it looks fantastic. We'll be keeping a close eye on this one, folks!\nStarseeker: Astroneer Expeditions\nDeveloper: System Era Softworks\nPublisher: Devolver Digital\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nOk, let's get this out of the way first, Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions is not Astroneer 2 or a sequel of any kind. Instead, this upcoming PS5 game is a new entry in the series set in the Astroneer universe. Players will have to work together here to complete planet-wide objectives across tons of different star systems. Embark on expeditions, discover vibrant worlds and their features, face dangerous creatures, and see how your ever-evolving space station changes with each upgrade. Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions currently has no release date, but we do know that it has its sights set on a 2026 launch.\nMARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra\nDeveloper: Skydance New Media\nPublisher: Plaion\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nOut of all the upcoming Marvel games on the horizon, we are most excited about MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra. So far, we've only seen a cinematic story trailer for this new PS5 game, showing off Black Panther and Captain America facing each other in a war-torn occupied Paris during WW2. The teaser is thrilling, so already we are hooked! While we are still waiting for a firm release date on this one, we do know that it's set to come out sometime in 2026. So, stay tuned for updates!\nPragmata\nDeveloper: Capcom\nPublisher: Capcom\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nCapcom revealed a mysterious new game called Pragmata that leaves more questions than it answers, but certainly piqued a lot of interest when it was added to the upcoming PS5 games list. Described as a \"thought-provoking game\", the trailer shows someone in what looks like a space suit in a futuristic setting, where they encounter a young girl called Diana and a holo-cat. While it's only coming in 2026, we're certainly eager to learn more about this rather enigmatic adventure.\nNioh 3\nDeveloper: Team Ninja\nPublisher: Koei Tecmo\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nWith Nioh 2, Team Ninja really left their own mark on the soulslike genre \u2013 combining tricky clashes with powerful yokai with the ability to turn the tides with your own demonic powers. Nioh 3, however, looks to be going beyond a straight sequel, embracing the improvements Team Ninja made to their own formula with Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, which imagined a supernatural world set in Chinese history that was their own riff on what FromSoftware accomplished with Sekiro. Here, it comes full circle, as Nioh 3 incorporating the greater mobility and exploration introduced in Wo Long into the world of Nioh 3.\n007 First Light\nDeveloper: IO Interactive\nPublisher: IO Interactive\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nIO Interactive is gearing up to tell the origin story for James Bond in a brand new game originally titled Project 007 before getting the fresh name of 007 First Light. Although details are scarce, we recently got a new trailer during the last State of Play showcase that showed off some gameplay. We also know is that it's going to be an entirely original James Bond story - so not tied to the novels or films. Hakan Abrak, CEO of IO says that it is \"the most ambitious game in the history of our studio\". Exciting times ahead.\nMarvel: TOKON Fighting Souls\nDeveloper: Arc System Works\nPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nHere's a State of Play reveal that nobody had on the cards: Arc System Works (Guilty Gear, Double Dragon) has unveiled Marvel: TOKON Fighting Souls, a 4v4 tag team fighting game set in the Marvel universe. Though there's no exact release date beyond 2026, we've already seen that the likes of Spider-Man, Doom, Ghost Rider, Storm, Captain America, and Iron Man will all be playable. It's hard to understate how big a collaboration this is, so fans of the best fighting games should absolutely keep their eyes peeled for more news on this ahead of it launching on PC and PS5.\nBloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement\nDeveloper: ArtPlay\nPublisher: 505 Games\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nCastlevania fans, this one's for you. Featuring all the 3D side-scrolling hack-n'-slash action you could wish for, Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement is an upcoming PS5 game on the way in 2026. It's already looking like everything a self respecting Victorian gothic fan could ask for: winding stone castles, dramatic flowing capes, a lady in a fancy hat sitting atop a pile of human skulls\u2026 honestly, the cool Soulsy combat is almost a mere bonus to the sheer spooky vibes the reveal trailer gives off. We'd expect nothing less from developer ArtPlay, so the new Bloodstained game is definitely one to keep an eye on in the coming months.\nSea of Remnants\nDeveloper: Joker Studio\nPublisher: NetEase Games\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nAny game introduced with its own folk song gets a pass in our books, and that goes double when pirates are involved. An adventure RPG set on the high seas, Sea of Remnants has opened pre-registration. Beyond that, we haven't heard too much about what's in store beyond ship-based battles and some sort of slot machine-wielding crab. Hopefully that last one's explained sooner rather than later, eh?\nRomeo is a Dead Man\nDeveloper: Grasshopper Manufacture\nPublisher: Grasshopper Manufacture\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nRevealed with a stylishly animated trailer, lashings of ultra violence, and a truly devil-may-care attitude, it could only be a new game from Grasshopper Manufacturer. Romeo is a Dead Man is the latest creation from Suda51, complete with hand-drawn animations, zombies, gore, and plenty of (bitten) tongue-in-cheek humor to boot. Our FBI-investigator protagonist Romeo Stargazer is as outrageous as his name in both manner and mayhem, tearing through zomboid enemies in the reveal trailer for a chaotic taste of the carnage in store.\nBlighted\nDeveloper: Drinkbox Studios\nPublisher: Drinkbox Studios\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nDescribed as a \"psychedelic western nightmare\", this Metroidvania comes from the steady hands at Drinkbox Studios \u2013 responsible for the likes of Guacamelee and Nobody Saves the World. The colorful, crunchy action takes place in a sort of isometric perspective, which reminds us of the likes of Hades. Here, however, you can play through your adventure either solo or with 3-players, making this a more sociable experience \u2013 if this is anything like the co-op fun that was in Guacamelee 2, we're in for a riotous time.\nInfinitesimals\nDeveloper: Cubit Studios\nPublisher: Epic Games Publishing\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nYou might be small, but you are at least mighty \u2013 the threats you're facing\u2026 rather mundane? When your spaceship crashes on a strange planet, you have to contend with the wildlife and strange structures that resemble a somewhat futuristic Earth. Think if Pikmin were a shooter and looked way more realistic. With your fellow alien squad scattered to the winds, it's up to brave the blades of grass and insects in your way to get them back, and find out what happened to the colony you were sent to join up with.\nTBC\nEuro Truck Simulator 2\nDeveloper: SCS Software\nPublisher: SCS Software\nRelease date: TBC\nFor too long, PC players have had one of the best simulator games all to themselves, well, no more! Euro Truck Simulator 2 (as well as American Truck Simulator) is finally coming to consoles. Travel across Europe as a new trucker with a ton of deliveries to get through as you grow your truck empire. Explore 60 real-life cities, build up your own fleet of drivers, and customize your vehicles to your heart's content. Euro Truck Simulator 2 is still one of the best PC games you can play right now, and we can't wait until a PS5 release date gets announced.\nPersona 4 Revival\nDeveloper: Atlus\nPublisher: Sega\nRelease date: TBC\nAfter years of rumors and wishful thinking, Inaba is looking particularly luscious in our first look at the Persona 4 remake. Revealed during Summer Game Fest 2025, Persona 4 Revival will be giving one of the best Persona games a modern makeover for the PS5 as we follow the high schooler Yu Narukami in a high-stakes murder mystery. From the trailer, we've seen that all the original aspects that we loved about the JRPG are still seemingly in tack. However, we assume that we'll soon hear news on some tweaks and changes once a release date gets announced as well.\nGood Boy\nDeveloper: Observer Interactive\nPublisher: Team 17\nRelease date: TBC\nIf you are a fan of the Disney Movie WALL-E then Good Boy will likely become top of your PS5 Wishlist. In this adorable creature collector and exploration game you control a LAIKA Space Rover. Capture and research alien creatures, complete your Rover quests, form bonds, and discover all the secrets hiding on the planet Terra II. The trailer for this upcoming indie almost gave me a cuteness overload, so I'll definitely be picking this one up personally as well as soon as release date is announced.\nAphelion\nDeveloper: DON'T NOD\nPublisher: DON'T NOD\nRelease date: TBC\nDevelopers of Life is Strange are diving into a brand new sci-fi story with the new PS5 game, Aphelion. Made in collaboration with the European Space Agency, Aphelion tells the story of a character crash landing on a strange and hostile planet, on a mission to find someone named \"Thomas\". However, don't expect a walk in the park for this journey as Aphelion is deadly and you\u2019ll be engaging in plenty of \"tense stealth gameplay\". Currently we're still waiting for a release date for this one, so stay tuned!\nSuper Meat Boy 3D\nDeveloper: Team Meat\nPublisher: Headup\nRelease date: TBC\nSuper Meat Boy is getting a fancy new 3D makeover in the upcoming PS5 game, Super Meat Boy 3D, after years of delighting us all with his 2D outings. On a mission to save his girlfriend, you'll have to guide Meat Boy through some of the most brutal and scream inducing platformer levels you'll ever face. But hey, who said love was easy, right? Currently we are still waiting on a release date for this one, however, we can all rest easy knowing that it'll be a bloody, delightful affair once it does launch.\nAtomic Heart 2\nDeveloper: Mundfish\nPublisher: Mundfish\nRelease date: TBC\nLook: managing to work the phrase \"Atomic Heart 2\" into your Atomic Heart 2 reveal trailer is a feat that's worth acknowledging. Soundtrack it to Don't Stop Me Now, and you've already got a tone that's sillier than even the first game. We've got no release window for this upcoming PS5 game, but given the trailer's only just confirming it's in development, it could be a while before we get our hands on Atomic Heart 2.\nThe Cube\nDeveloper: Mundfish\nPublisher: Mundfish\nRelease date: TBC\nAs if Atomic Heart 2's reveal at Summer Game Fest 2025 wasn't enough, Mundfish also revealed The Cube \u2013 an MMO RPG set in the same universe as Atomic Heart. The premise is as simple as it is weird: a gigantic floating cube has appeared in the sky, and scientists are racing to uncover a reality-changing equation that's hidden within. The catch? There's all sorts of sentient life on its surface, and the cube itself \u2013 so big it has its own biomes \u2013 is constantly rotating. Multiplayer shooters are hard to crack, but this one really does sound as interesting as it does strange.\nChrono Odyssey\nDeveloper: Chrono Studio\nPublisher: Kakao Games\nRelease date: TBC\nWith enough Soulslike energy and grimdark fantasy vibes to give Malenia a heartattack, Chrono Odyssey is an upcoming action-MMORPG set in a \"seamlessly designed open world\". Team up with your friends (or total strangers) to explore every inch, defeating all manner of hulking, brutish monsters in your path using time-bending powers to even the score. Freezing foes in place, levitating them\u2026 you decide.\nAssassin's Creed Hexe\nDeveloper: Ubisoft Montreal\nPublisher: Ubisoft\nRelease date: TBC\nUbisoft Montreal \u2013 the birthplace of Assassin's Creed \u2013 is working on a very different type of entry to the series. Following the release of Assassin's Creed Valhalla in 2020, the studio has been quietly working on Assassin's Creed Codename Hexe under the leadership of Watch Dogs Legion's creative director Clint Hocking. While it's thought to be in early development, an early tease suggests a far darker setting that could revolve around Europe's bloody 16th century witch trials. Sadly, there's a good chance we'll be waiting until 2025 and beyond for this one.\nCities Skylines 2\nDeveloper: Colossal Order\nPublisher: Paradox\nRelease date: TBC\nCities Skylines 2 is finally coming to console after its PC launch last year, and is the long-awaited sequel to one of the most popular city builders of all time. It's bringing with it enhanced features like better road tools, public and cargo transportation, traffic AI, massive 150 tile maps per unique city, and a cinematic camera. We'll also be able to get much closer to the action than ever before, with the opportunity to follow individual citizens from birth to death in your city.\nDune Awakening\nDeveloper: Funcom\nPublisher: Funcom\nRelease date: TBC (PC release June 10, 2025)\nFuncom is bringing us a new survival open-world MMO set in the vast landscape of the classic sci-fi setting Arrakis. Dune: Awakening is said to blend the survival game genre with a multiplayer experience as you try to live in the harsh landscapes of the planet. You'll be building shelters to weather sandstorms, looking after your stillsuit, and trying to brave the deep desertland. It'll be interesting to see how the famous setting serves as a home for an MMO experience. During Gamescom 2024, it was announced that the game is set to release in Early Access for PC players in 2025. However, we are still waiting on a PS5 release window.\nElder Scrolls 6\nDeveloper: Bethesda Game Studios\nPublisher: Bethesda\nRelease date: TBC\nAh, the Elder Scrolls 6. The 37-second trailer that blew the world's mind at E3 2018. The game that we know nothing about beyond this same trailer, that is in development somewhere within Bethesda Game Studios along with Starfield. Because it is so far away from release, you can bet your bottom coin that it's going to appear - at some point - on the PS5 (although hopefully not whatever the PS6 could be).\nFairgames\nDeveloper: Haven Studios\nPublisher: SIE\nRelease date: TBC\nHaven Studios was acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2022, becoming part of the PlayStation Studios family to help lead the PS5's expanding live service initiative. The studio's debut is Fairgames, an all-new co-op experience where you'll team up with friends to go up against the corporate overloads squeezing the life out of the world. A report surfaced in 2025 that studio lead Jade Raymond had parted ways with the project, and we're still awaiting a further update on the new multiplayer experience.\nIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet\nDeveloper: Naughty Dog\nPublisher: SIE\nRelease date: TBC\nIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is the new game from Last of Us and Uncharted developer Naughty Dog. Currently in development for PS5, the project has been in the works since 2020 and will see us take on the role of new protagonist Jordan A.

Set on an open-world fantasy planet that's described as being the same size as the Earth, you'll be given the freedom to explore its diverse biomes as you try to unravel its lore and mysteries. With building and survival aspects, we also saw in the reveal trailer that you can fly through the vistas on the back of a dragon, climb mountains, and even set sail across the oceans.\nMarvel's Wolverine\nDeveloper: Insomniac\nPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment\nRelease date: TBC\nUndoubtedly one of the biggest surprises of the PlayStation September 2021 showcase came in the shape of those famous adamantium claws belonging to none other than Wolverine. Yes, a new standalone Marvel's Wolverine game is currently in development. While we're light on details for the moment, we do know Brian Horton is Wolverine's creative director, and Cameron Christian is the game director. Horton was creative director on Spider-Man Miles Morales and has also worked on games such as Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider.\nNew Mass Effect\nDeveloper: BioWare\nPublisher: EA\nRelease date: TBC\nIt might be quite a way off release, but that isn't going to stop us being ridiculously overexcited for a brand new Mass Effect game - aka Mass Effect 5. Seemingly picking up after the events of Mass Effect 3, we'll be seeing some old faces return and some plot lines picked back up. Of course, the big question of whether Shepard will return remains, but we're ready for everything.\nNew Virtua Fighter Project\nDeveloper: Rya Ga Gotoku Studio\nPublisher: Sega\nRelease date: TBC\nVery little is known about the new Virtua Fighter Project currently in the works, but the the brief teaser trailer showed off a powerful figure in a hat who punched another man through a wall. Said to be a completely new project in the Virtua Fighter series, it's certainly one to watch out for.\nOkami sequel\nDeveloper: Capcom\nPublisher: Capcom\nRelease date: TBC\nA sequel to the beloved painterly adventure Okami is currently in the works from Capcom and game director Hideki Kamiya. With a brief teaser trailer show so far, we've only gotten of glimpse of the follow-up so far, but it looks set to bring us to another gorgeous world in the same signature style, with the promise of a heartwarming story in the same vein as the original as we once again take on the role of Amaterasu.\nPhantom Blade 0\nDeveloper: Cruel Man Studio\nPublisher: S-Game\nRelease date: TBC\nIf you're a fan of samurai swashbuckling and moody feudal Japan as a setting, Phantom Blade 0 seems to be promising us both. The third person action title is yet to have a confirmed release date, but from what we've seen at the PlayStation Showcase 2023, your character has \"66 days to live\". What will he do with it? \"Get my heart back,\" he responds. We don't know much else just yet, but its brooding color scheme and fast-paced melee combat seem like a dynamic blend of Gungrave GORE aesthetics with Ghost of Tsushima action, and we're already here for it.\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake\nDeveloper: Aspyr\nPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment and Lucasfilms Games\nRelease date: TBC\nAfter many rumors began circulating, the latest Sony showcase confirmed that a remaster of BioWare's beloved Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is on the way, and the upcoming Star Wars game is coming to PS5. Aspyr and Sony Interactive Entertainment are working with Lucasfilm Games to rebuild the classic adventure, which promises to bring KOTOR to a new generation with \"modern tech, features, visuals, and more, while maintaining the integrity of the story and characters\" so many have come to love.\nThick as Thieves\nDeveloper: OtherSide Entertainment\nPublisher: Megabit Publishing\nRelease date: TBC\nWhat happens when several thieves, each with their own special set of talents gets put on the same heist. Well, you can find out the answer to that question with the upcoming PvPvE game, Thick as Thieves. Outwit and act fast to steal treasure before any other players can get their hands on it. However, be warned, it isn't easy rising through the ranks in a 1910s metropolis that is filled with shadows and magic. Thick as Thieves looks to be tons of fun and an exciting spin to typical stealth based gameplay. Currently, we're still waiting for a release date for it, so stay tuned for updates.\nLumines Arise\nDeveloper: Enhance, Monstars\nPublisher: TBC\nRelease date: TBC\nWhere do you go from a game as sublime as Tetris Effect? Switch gears, and apply the same Enhance transcendental puzzling action to another franchise entirely with Lumines Arise. Promising to take us away to yet another synesthetic sensory wonderland, reviving the PSP classic Lumines: Puzzle Fusion from Q Entertainment. Like Tetris, it's all about falling blocks, except here you have to nudge them into 2x2 grids and match colors to get them to pop. The must-have portable puzzler drew comparisons to Tetris with its original release, so it's the perfect successor for the Tetris Effect developers to have some more fun.\nILL\nDeveloper: Team Cloud\nPublisher: Mundfish Powerhouse\nRelease date: TBC\nPerhaps the gnarliest game of Summer Game Fest 2025, Ill has resurfaced after several years of cooking from developer Team Cloud. It comes with good news for horror fans: it looks gnarlier than ever, with its creature design leaning into body horror with zombified babies and \u2013 for lack of a better term \u2013 inside-out people. There was also a huge emphasis on reactivity to gunshots \u2013 shoot a humanoid in the leg, and it stumbles down for an execution. This has been on indie horror fans' radars for years, but fingers crossed it's inching toward a release date now that it's under the wing of Atomic Heart developer Mundfish's new creative label.\nFor more future releases coming to other platforms, head over to our lists for all the upcoming PC games, upcoming Switch 2 games, and upcoming Switch games.\nSam Loveridge is the Brand Director and former Global Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar.

We can expect things to be pretty different when we return to Seattle, and here we've gathered everything we know so far.\nBased on Naughty Dog's popular games, The Last of Us has to deal with plenty of fans' expectations, and work to surprise even those who know what's next in the story. In the upcoming season, Kaitlyn Dever's Abby will step into focus while Bella Ramsey's Ellie takes a backseat for now, and that's only one of the many details that will be key for the future of the show. After the shocking The Last of Us season 2 ending, we can't wait to see what's in store for the characters.\nCelebrating one of the most exciting upcoming TV shows, we've put together a guide with everything you need to know about The Last of Us season 3 release date window, confirmed cast, plot details, and the timeline of the game. Be warned, though: there are spoilers for The Last of Us season 2 below, as well as spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2, so make sure you're caught up before you read any further.\nThe Last of Us season 3 release date speculation\nThe release date for The Last of Us season 3 has not been announced yet, but we can expect a 2027 release, according to HBO boss Casey Bloys.\n\"The series is definitely planned for 2027,\" said Bloys in July 2025. \"Craig [Mazin] is still working it out whether it will be two more seasons or one more long season. It hasn't been decided yet, and I'm following Craig's lead on that.\"\nA few weeks later, on August 19, Craig Mazin said he is still writing the scripts. \"This is kind of my favorite time. It\u2019s very quiet. It\u2019s just sitting here with my wonderful ergonomic keyboard and clacking away. The pages are happening,\" he told The Hollywood Reporter.\nMazin also revealed season 3 will be longer than season 2. \"We're kind of fiddling around with that \u2013 it's a little bit of a trade secret at the moment. But I will say that season three will be longer than season two. Season three will be more on par with season one. More bang for the buck,\" he explained.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nThe Last of Us season 1 aired in 2023 and The Last of Us season 2 premiered in 2025, so we expected a two-year wait for season 3.\nCo-showrunner and head writer Craig Mazin told GamesRadar+ in April that they had not yet begun writing season 3 at that point. Now that season 2 has ended, it's likely that work will begin fairly soon, and we'll have a better idea as time goes on.\nThe Last of Us season 3 plot *SPOILERS*\nThe Last of Us season 3 will continue to adapt The Last of Us Part 2, which follows Ellie as she sets out for revenge against Abby, who brutally murders Joel after it's revealed that the surgeon Joel killed at the end of season 1 was actually Abby's father. And not only that, he was also the only living doctor who was capable of making a cure for the Cordyceps virus. At the end of The Last of Us season 2, Ellie manages to kill all of Abby's friends before she and Abby have their first confrontation, which ends with Jesse's death. Abby then shoots Ellie before we cut to Abby waking up in The Stadium (WLF headquarters) with on-screen text that reads, \"Seattle Day One.\"\nCatherine O'Hara recently confirmed that season 3 will, in fact, center on Abby's story - which isn't a shock to anyone who has played Part 2. To explain, The Last of Us Part 2 is told from Ellie and Abby's points of view, with the player controlling both characters. The timeline in the game is then split in two: Ellie's perspective: Jackson, Seattle Day One, Seattle Day Two, Seattle Day Three; Abby's perspective: Seattle Day One, Seattle Day Two, Seattle Day Three; and The Farm/Santa Barbara.\nThe switch to Abby's perspective shows us what she was doing during those three days that Elie and Dina were hunting her down, and gives us some backstory that makes us reluctantly sympathetic for her and her reasons for killing Joel. Day Three takes us back to the The Last of Us season 2 finale, but from Abby's perspective - the player hunts Ellie down, rather than hide from Abby.\nDuring The Farm part of the game, we see Ellie's life with Dina and their baby. Their peaceful life is interrupted when Tommy pops up and tells Ellie that he's tracked Abby's whereabouts to Santa Barbara - and that she should absolutely go and kill her (which does seem a little out of pocket for TV show Tommy). Ellie does leave for Santa Barbara, which is where Abby and Ellie's final showdown takes place. The game ends from Ellie's perspective.\nThat being said, we can speculate that The Last of Us season 3 will start with Abby's Seattle Day One, Two, and Three - and potentially end there. Because a season 4 has been planned (though not yet renewed), it's possible that the fourth season will center on The Farm and Santa Barbara, saving Abby and Ellie's final confrontation until then (especially with what O'Hara said about season 3 focusing mainly on Abby's story). It's worth noting that season 2 does change the narrative quite a bit, what with telling us within just the first few minutes of the season that Abby plans to kill Joel - rather than keep her reasoning something of a mystery until we play through her perspective.\nBecause of this, we can expect many more narrative changes as well as a crop of new characters. It's possible that showrunners and writers Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann decided to save Lev and Yara, two members of Abby's crew who become essential to Ellie's story, for season 3 so as not to muddle or complicate the main plot.\nThe Last of Us season 3 cast\nThough her friends are dead, season 3 will show us what Abby was doing in Seattle while Ellie and Dina were hunting her down. Because of this, Abby's crew will return - though we're not sure if Lev and Yara, two members of the WLF who become an important part of Ellie's life and story, will appear. Bella Ramsey and Isabela Merced will no doubt return, as well as Jeffrey Wright's terrifying Isaac, who has more or less been made a larger antagonist in the show than he was in the game (and we're not complaining). We can also only speculate that deceased characters like Jesse and Joel will appear in flashbacks.\nIt's also worth noting that Catherine O'Hara said she \"definitely\" wouldn't be appearing in season 3, because of its central focus on Abby.\nNeil Druckmann (creator of The Last of Us video game franchise) even confirmed more of a focus on Abby at a FYC event, suggesting that Dever would step in as lead in The Last of Us season 3. We also most likely won't be heading back to Jackson in season 3, though Tommy and Maria do appear in The Farm portion of the game (which we may or may not see in season 3, but are much more likely to see in season 4).\nHowever, Druckmann (creator of The Last of Us video game franchise) will not be returning as co-showrunner and head writer, with screenwriter Halley Gross (who co-wrote The Last of Us Part 2 with Druckmann) exiting the show as well. Craig Mazin will remain showrunner for season 3. Druckmann is leaving to focus on his new video game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. He will likely remain an executive producer on The Last of Us TV show.\nBrand new characters created specifically for the show are also likely to appear (and the Seraphites will make a return, given that they are the main enemy of the WLF). Based on what we know so far, we've compiled a speculative cast list below.\n- Bella Ramsey as Ellie\n- Kaitlyn Dever as Abby\n- Pedro Pascal as Joel\n- Gabriel Luna as Tommy\n- Rutina Wesley as Maria\n- Isabela Merced as Dina\n- Jeffrey Wright as Isaac\n- Spencer Lord as Owen\n- Tati Gabrielle as Nora\n- Danny Ramirez as Manny\n- Ariela Barer as Mel\n- Alanna Ubach as Hanrahan\n- Ben Ahlers as Burton\nIs there a The Last of Us season 3 trailer?\nThere is no trailer for The Last of Us season 3, as writing or filming has not yet begun. Because we can speculate that the season will air in 2027, we can most likely expect a trailer around then, if not in late 2026.\nIs The Last of Us season 3 the final season?\nAs Mazin and Druckmann have said time and time again (including to GamesRadar+ directly), it looks like they plan to stretch The Last of Us Part 2 over at least two more seasons. After the official season 3 renewal, Mazin told Collider: \"There\u2019s no way to complete this narrative in a third season. Hopefully, we\u2019ll earn our keep enough to come back and finish it in a fourth. That\u2019s the most likely outcome.\"\nHBO boss Casey Bloys, however, said in July 2025 that Mazin is now considering the possibility of only one more season: \"Craig is still working it out whether it will be two more seasons or one more long season. It hasn\u2019t been decided yet, and I\u2019m following Craig\u2019s lead on that.\"\nSeason 3, adapting the same timeline as the video game, will focus on Kaitlyn Dever's Abby, and show us where she was when Ellie and Dina took off for Seattle, leading us back up to the events of the season 2 finale. However, if season 3 is once again only seven episodes, we can speculate that season 4 will give us the final showdown between Ellie and Abby that happens at the very end of the game.\nThe Last of Us seasons 1 and 2 are streaming now on HBO Max in the US and NOW in the UK.

Both co-creator Neil Druckmann and writer/producer Halley Gross have stepped back from the HBO series to focus on their day jobs at Naughty Dog, particularly with the arrival of Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.\n\"I've made the difficult decision to step away from my creative involvement in The Last of Us on HBO,\" Druckmann said in a message shared on social media, while also describing his time on the show as an \"honor\" and a \"career highlight.\"\n\"With work completed on season 2 and before any meaningful work starts on season 3, now is the right time for me to transition my complete focus to Naughty Dog and its future projects, including writing and directing our exciting next game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, along with my responsibilities as Studio Head and Head of Creative.\"\nFor more, discover the new PS5 games and new TV shows currently in the works.\nI'm the Senior Entertainment Writer here at GamesRadar+, focusing on news, features, and interviews with some of the biggest names in film and TV.

      "text": "Craig Mazin will be The Last of Us season three\u2019s lone writer after co-creator Neil Druckmann and co-writer Halley Gross announced they were stepping away from the series. (Druckmann co-developed the original Last of Us game and directed The Last of Us: Part II, which he co-wrote with Gross.) Emmy-winning writer-director Mazin (Chernobyl), who this year is nominated for outstanding drama series, spoke to THR about how the HBO thriller focusing on the survivors of a mass fungal infection that collapses modern-day society has helped level up the art of game-to-small-screen adaptations and whether he\u2019s already busy writing the third season.\nRelated Stories\nVideo game adaptations are nothing new, but a TV spinoff earning Emmys is. Has The Last of Us proved that video game adaptations can hold their own?\nYeah. I think that in the wake of The Last of Us, a ton of video game projects got greenlit. Fallout was already happening, and that was fantastic in its first season, and I\u2019m really looking forward to the second season. There\u2019s just this incredible wave coming. Like anything, when people first said, \u201cHey, let\u2019s start adapting books into movies or television shows,\u201d some of them are going to be great, some of them will stumble. But the idea that the industry has woken up to how rich some of that storytelling is and how wonderful it is to adapt is fantastic.\nWhere are you with writing season three?\nThis is kind of my favorite time. It\u2019s very quiet. It\u2019s just sitting here with my wonderful ergonomic keyboard and clacking away. The pages are happening, and I get to be a monk for a while, which I love, and I just write. It\u2019s the purest form of what I do. And then in just a couple of months or so, that happy time will start to be less quiet because we begin a very long prep period while I\u2019m still writing, and then we begin to shoot while I\u2019m still writing. In seasons one and two, I finished writing about six weeks before we started shooting the last episode. I don\u2019t necessarily recommend this method other than to say this works for me, but it is insane.\nNow that Neil is stepping away to focus on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, will the writing process change?\nI don\u2019t think it is, in the sense that I was pretty much a monk just writing in a room by myself for most of the time regardless. And I\u2019ve gotten so much out of talking with them over the course of seasons one and two. When we made season two, we really were thinking about what comes after because you can\u2019t really tell half of that story without thinking about what the whole story should be. So we really did get that work in. Neil\u2019s always had a full-time job running Naughty Dog, so it\u2019s always been me up in Canada [where the production is], and, ultimately, things are pretty much going to proceed as usual.\nWhat were the most challenging scenes to shoot, logistics- and VFX-wise?\nEpisode two, the attack on Jackson, Wyoming, was an enormous undertaking for everybody. It was hard to write, it was hard to plan, it was hard to shoot. The prosthetics, the stunts and then the visual effects afterward were just massive. So we had [VFX houses] Weta and DNEG and about five other companies all working together to create all of the moments, and that was insane.\nThere were nine episodes in the first season but only seven in this one, and yet the pacing feels so different. Despite the fact that everything takes place in a span of three days, the attack on Jackson feels like it was ages ago. How does it compare to the game?\nThe attack on Jackson is not in the video game, so that\u2019s new to our show. It\u2019s one of those surprises that people who played the game would be like, \u201cOh!\u201d But, yeah, the characters have gone through quite a bit, but the way we use time, it\u2019s almost like so much of season two is really about three days, and I love being able to focus in on a period of time.\nThe Last of Us subreddit is quite a busy place. How closely do you keep track of the chatter and are there responses that surprise you?\nI don\u2019t look at them, so I don\u2019t know. Problem solved! I don\u2019t go on Reddit. I mean, I\u2019m always playing video games; I\u2019m playing The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered right now. Sometimes I\u2019ll go on Reddit when I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat is the best bow for an archer build?\u201d That\u2019s about as much Redditing as I do.\nWhat lessons did you learn from Chernobyl that you brought with you to The Last of Us?\nFor starters, I learned how much attention to detail matters. [What] we showed in Chernobyl was really born out of a desire to be as respectful as possible to the culture. We were telling a story that impacted people who are still alive, who lost people.\nI just had a sense that stories that have been told in the West about the Soviet Union were not accurate, and why not go for as real, real, real as you can? That approach to being as grounded as we can, especially in a genre story where there are monsters, is something that I brought forward. The style of shooting is something I pulled through \u2014 and I say it every time \u2014 but everything I ever learned about directing, I learned by watching Johan Renck direct Chernobyl. I really internalized the way that he used multiple cameras as an artistic choice, as opposed to just [shoot] faster.\nThe other thing that I learned from Chernobyl was how important it was for the people who were at the creative helm to pay as much attention to visual effects as they do to anything else that you don\u2019t. In your mind, you think, \u201cI\u2019ll just send this away, it\u2019ll come back, I\u2019ll put it in the show.\u201d It doesn\u2019t work like that at all. It is almost like doing takes with an actor: \u201cGreat, now let\u2019s try this. Great, let\u2019s try this.\u201d And then, \u201cAh, there it is.\u201d And that process of working through visual effects is exhausting and exhaustive for everybody, but I think what we end up getting is pretty remarkable, and it makes the show better. I just believe that visual effects are beyond integral to the success of a show like ours.\nBefore Chernobyl, you worked on The Hangover films. How much are you itching to get back to comedy?\nNot strong itches. I mean, I spent a long time doing comedy, and even though I\u2019ve been doing drama \u2014 it\u2019s been about five, six years. Prior to that, it was like 25 years of comedy. Look, I think I\u2019ve told all the jokes. I think my comedy is used up. I like having moments. I like having moments inside of drama. And I love working with comedic actors in dramatic roles because we can find comedy in there. So you do a scene where you\u2019ve got Catherine O\u2019Hara and she has this very heavy scene with therapy and all the rest, but still we find the funny in it because, of course, we do. But going back to pure comedy, I think probably, no, I don\u2019t think so.\nDo you envision directing the first episode of TLOU season three as you\u2019ve done with the first two seasons?\nYeah. Honestly, I\u2019d love to direct more, but the problem is just logistics. I like to direct the first episode because you can prep the whole season. There are a lot of characters that get cast and there are a lot of decisions that get made about environments, so you can sort of prep a lot of the season by prepping and directing the first episode. As we\u2019re going along, you have to prep the other episodes. We have directors alternating, and I\u2019m on set doing \u2014 I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d call it \u2014 \u201cshowrunner QC\u201d sounds insulting to our directors, who are amazing. But [I\u2019m] just making sure everything is fitting together tonally. So it\u2019s hard for me to then go prep something while I\u2019m also still writing, but we\u2019ll see if I can get away with [directing] more than one.\nAre more people lining up for roles now that The Last of Us has more Emmy nods?\nIt\u2019s not quite like people knocking on your door as much as I think after season one. There may have been actors who were unaware of the video game or the show, but what they were aware of was that we were filling up those guest actor Emmy categories pretty extensively. We had fewer actual guest actors in season two, but we\u2019ve still got Jeffrey Wright, Joey Pantoliano, Kaitlyn Dever and Catherine O\u2019Hara, [who] all got nominated [for best guest acting in a drama series]. So when we pull people in, I think at least in the community, there\u2019s an understanding they\u2019re going to get something juicy to do. They\u2019re not glorified day players. We try and create these little tiny, impactful stories with really, really good actors. So as we head into season three, I hope that we\u2019ll see a couple of more fascinating additions like that.\nFor me, it\u2019s so much fun to [say], \u201cHey, let\u2019s just get Melanie Lynskey, why don\u2019t we?\u201d And to discover brilliant new talent, Keivonn Montreal Woodard, who had never acted before, and there he is getting an Emmy nomination for season one \u2014 that was just incredible. And Storm Reid won \u2014 obviously, she wasn\u2019t new, but it was giving actors these interesting things to do that maybe they don\u2019t normally get to do. Nick Offerman, who also won, normally doesn\u2019t get to play that guy. And I love doing that.\nWho\u2019s on your wish list for actors to write for?\nMy wishlist is Meryl Streep. I\u2019ve always had [her] on my wishlist since I started in this business. I\u2019ve never worked with her, but I met her when I was at the Golden Globes and I ran into somebody who was there with her. We were talking, and he was like, \u201cDo you want to meet Meryl? She\u2019s just around the corner. She\u2019s going to walk over.\u201d And I was like, \u201cI would love to meet Meryl Streep. Yes!\u201d\nSo she comes over and he [introduces us]. And I shook her hand and I went, \u201cPffff. You know!\u201d [Raises hands] And she was like, \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d I wanted to say, \u201cOh my God! I love you in this [and] this!\u201d But I just figured, everyone always says that. I\u2019m just going to package it into just, \u201cInsert here, me just freaking out.\u201d And she was really nice and seemed to accept that I was freaking out. So anyway, I short-handed it to, \u201cYou know!\u201d\nI have not spoken to Meryl Streep, I have not written anything for her \u2014 yet \u2014 but one day, one day!\nYou just announced you and podcast co-host John August are releasing a book based on ScriptNotes. Will Neil and Halley ever join the pod guests?\nNeil and I have done at this point, 16 podcasts for the show and Halley\u2019s been on, so that\u2019s sort of that. ScriptNotes, the show has been going on forever. It was just hardcore screenwriting nerds, and it sort of expanded a bit. And we\u2019ll get pitches from publicity people like, \u201cHey, would you like this person or this person?\u201d But John and I have always felt we will bring guests on the show, but mostly we\u2019re just keeping it a non-guest show so that it doesn\u2019t turn into a talk show.\nYou got a tattoo of Ellie\u2019s switchblade to commemorate The Last of Us\u2019 success. Any plans to get any more show-inspired ink?\nI don\u2019t have a specific plan, but I\u2019m thinking maybe when it\u2019s over. The other possibility is that I go for a tattoo-per-show method, so I only have the one. I may say, \u201cOK, this is my Last of Us tattoo, now let\u2019s see what comes next, and maybe that\u2019ll be the next one,\u201d but no plans yet. \u201cNo ragrets!\u201d\nSince the second season only covered the first half of the second video game, what will the pacing and episode count be like for this next installment and beyond?\nWe\u2019re kind of fiddling around with that \u2014 it\u2019s a little bit of a trade secret at the moment. But I will say that season three will be longer than season two. Season three will be more on par with season one. More bang for the buck.\nThis story first appeared in an August stand-alone issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

I couldn\u2019t have asked for a more generous creative partner,\" Mazin said in a statement (via Deadline). \"As a true fan of Naughty Dog and Neil\u2019s work in video games, I\u2019m beyond excited to play his next game. While he focuses on that, I\u2019ll continue to work with our brilliant cast and crew to deliver the show our audience has come to expect. We are so grateful to Neil and Halley Gross for entrusting the incredible story of The Last of Us Part II to us, and we\u2019re just as grateful to the millions of people around the world who tune in.\u201d\nIt was announced yesterday that Neil Druckmann, creator of The Last of Us video games and co-showrunner of the TV show, was stepping down from the latter in order to focus on his new game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. Druckmann wrote and directed several episodes of the show's first two seasons, but will not be directly involved with season 3 (or the rumored fourth season).\nThe TV series, which stars Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, has been a massive hit since its inception, with the first season earning several Golden Globe and Primetime Emmy nominations. The Last of Us season 2 adapts The Last of Us Part 2, but only focuses on one chunk of the lengthy game, with the rest being told over a confirmed third season and a likely fourth season. Druckmann co-wrote the game with Halley Gross, who served as an executive producer on the show, and co-wrote one of season 2's best episodes. Gross, too, announced yesterday that she is stepping away from the series to pursue other opportunities.\n\u201cI've decided to take a step back from my day-to-day work to focus on what comes next,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"Working alongside Neil, Craig, HBO and this remarkable cast and crew has been life changing,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe stories we told \u2013 about love, loss and what it means to be human in a terrifying world \u2013 are exactly why I love this franchise.\"\nThe Last of Us is streaming now on HBO Max.

      "text": "The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin says season 3 will be \"longer than season 2,\" but will be \"more on par\" with season 1: \"More bang for your buck\"\nThe third season will center primarily on Kaitlyn Dever's Abby\nThe Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin says season 3 will be, unsurprisingly, longer than season 2...but that it'll be a bit more like season 1.\n\"We're kind of fiddling around with that...it's a little bit of a trade secret at the moment,\" Craig Mazin told The Hollywood Reporter, when asked what the structure and episode count would be like for season 3. \"But I will say that season 3 will be longer than season 2. Season three will be more on par with season 1. More bang for the buck.\"\nThis makes perfect sense, given the length of The Last of Us Part 2, which takes around 42 hours of gameplay to hit 100% completion. The game is split into three parts: Seattle Day One from Ellie's perspective, Seattle Day Two in which the player is forced to play the game from Abby's perspective, and The Farm, which switches back to Ellie's perspective.\nThe Last of Us season 2, consisting of just seven episodes, focused on Ellie and Dina as they journeyed to Seattle to hunt down Abby, and ended on a cliffhanger with Abby waking up and onscreen text that read, \"Seattle Day One.\" Season 3 will focus on Kaitlyn Dever's Abby, and show us what she was up to during those three days that Ellie and Dina were looking for her. A fourth season is also highly likely, and will probably adapt The Farm section of the game.\nThe Last of Us is streaming now on HBO Max.

So, I haven't properly finished the second season.\"\nThose raising their eyebrows at The Last of Us not having everything locked in ahead of its second season premiere can rest easy, however. Mazin \u2013 who also acts as showrunner alongside Neil Druckmann \u2013 says they are \"99% of the way there.\"\n\"Obviously, we were very gratified by the critical response. Thank god it's been good and, even more so, the renewal we got from HBO means [there's] this enormous faith in it, and it means the audience doesn't have to worry about it being canceled. They can watch season two in peace knowing there will be a season three. But I'll take a few weeks. Then if there's one thing I know about myself, I will be absolutely champing at the bit to get back to the keyboard.\"\nThe Last of Us, starring Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, debuted back in 2023. The Last of Us season 2, which adapts part of 2020's The Last of Us Part 2, is set to hit our screens on April 13 on HBO in the US and April 14 on Sky and NOW TV in the UK.\nFor more, check out the upcoming PS5 games just over the horizon.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nI'm the Senior Entertainment Writer here at GamesRadar+, focusing on news, features, and interviews with some of the biggest names in film and TV.

Season 2 covered the first part of Part 2, which is the journey to Seattle from Ellie's perspective. In the final moments of the finale, Abby wakes up elsewhere, and the onscreen text says, \"Seattle Day One.\" This means we'll be seeing the same three days Ellie and Dina spent hunting down Abby, but from Abby's perspective.\nContinued Druckmann: \"I was sure that they wouldn't let us do this when we started adapting this, but they've leaned into what makes, I believe, the story special. And allowed us not only the time but the creative freedom to be able to take these swings, and I think the audience really appreciates that.\"\nA fourth season is being planned, and will likely cover the third part of Part 2, which features the ultimate showdown between Abby and Ellie.\nThe Last of Us season 2 is streaming now on HBO Max in the US, and on Sky and NOW in the UK.

      "text": "The best new TV shows coming your way in 2025\nFrom Slow Horses to Gen V, these are the best new TV shows still to come this year\nWhen it comes to picking the best new TV shows of 2025, it's tough because there are just so many great options. This year has already seen a slew of hits from multiple streaming services, such as Squid Game season 3 and, most recently, Alien: Earth and Peacemaker season 2. However, despite being over halfway through 2025, there's still plenty more for us to look forward to.\nAugust has been a strong month for TV, giving us some of the most anticipated new DC shows and horror outings of the year. However, looking further ahead, we also have Wednesday season 2 part 2, some more superhero action with a The Boys spin-off, and even the adorable return of one of the best Netflix shows Pokemon Concierge. Basically, there's something for every kind of TV fan still on the streaming horizon, no matter what genre is your go-to choice. There's a lot to get through, but we've decided to highlight our personal top picks still to come.\nSo what are you waiting for? Scroll on down for our handy guide on all the best new TV shows releasing in 2025 on the best streaming services out there, from Netflix and HBO Max, to Apple TV Plus. These shows are in order of release date, too, to make your watchlist a little easier to organize. Happy binge-watching!\nPeacemaker season 2\nRelease date: Out now!\nAvailable on: HBO Max\nJohn Cena returns as Peacemaker (after his Superman cameo) in season 2 of the hit DC show, which has now started to release weekly episodes. The new season is officially part of the new DCU Chapter One: Gods and Monsters, too, and (as we point out in our Peacemaker season 2 review) does a great job at explaining how the character's new DCU place fits despite its previous DCEU status. The series will be running through until October, and you can find out more on when to catch the next episode with our Peacemaker season 2 release schedule guide.\nThe Terminal List: Dark Wolf\nRelease date: August 27, 2025\nAvailable on: Prime Video\nDark Wolf is a new spin-off of Prime Video action thriller The Terminal List. The prequel follows the origin story of Taylor Kitsch's Chief Special Warfare Operator Ben Edwards as he's discharged from the Navy SEALS and forced to join the clandestine side of CIA Special Operations. Chris Pratt also returns as Lieutenant Commander James Reece, and Luke Hemsworth and The Umbrella Academy's Tom Hopper are new additions to the cast.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nWednesday season 2 part 2\nRelease date: Part 2 drops on September 3, 2025\nAvailable on: Netflix\nJenna Ortega made her return as our favorite homicidal maniac in Wednesday season 2 part 1 in August. However, her sophomore year is far from over, as after coming face to face with the Hyde once again (read our Wednesday season 2 part 1 ending explained for more on that), Wednesday looks to have her work cut out for her in season 2 part 2. As Wednesday further investigates what the Avian was really up to, the next part will hopefully answer some of our burning questions, like where is Ophelia, and when will Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux star Lady Gaga, whose role is still a mystery, appear in the series.\nPokemon Concierge season 2\nRelease date: September 4, 2025\nAvailable on: Netflix\nThe adorable Pokemon stop-motion series returns to Netflix with a long-awaited second season as new Pokemon Resort employee Haru settles into her role and encounters new challenges \u2013 and guests. These include Sealeo, Shinx, Corphish, and Arcanine, as well as her ex-boyfriend\u2026\nOnly Murders in the Building Season 5\nRelease date: September 9, 2025\nAvailable on: Hulu/Disney Plus\nOnly Murders in the Building is one of the best shows on Hulu, so we're delighted to see that we are officially getting a season 5 in just a few days! Starring Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez as our favorite true crime trio, this new season will pick up where season 4's cliffhanger ended. Basically, last season ended with Lester (Teddy Coluca) found dead, so expect a new mystery to unfold soon!\nThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season 3\nRelease date: September 12, 2025\nAvailable on: AMC Plus\nCarol and Daryl swap France for Spain in the third season of The Walking Dead spin-off The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon. Not so much a European jolly over the summer, but more of a desperate attempt to get back home to the States, the new installment is sure to see everyone's favorite apocalypse survivors face off against decomposing nasties and still-living baddies.\nGen V season 2\nRelease date: September 17, 2025\nAvailable on: Prime Video\nGen V season 2 is bringing us back to Godolkin University, and we can't wait to see what's next. Season 1 ended with the main characters trapped in the lab, and we know that what happened in The Boys season 4 (you know, Homelander taking over the Oval Office) will directly affect Gen V's timeline. This means that the new episodes won't see the Supe students doing much studying, for better or worse. The new season will introduce a mysterious new Dean who preaches a curriculum that promises to make students more powerful than ever, while Marie, Jordan, and Emma deal with months of trauma and loss. The spin-off show is coming back this year ahead of The Boys season 5, so make sure you tune in for the action.\nSlow Horses season 5\nRelease date: September 24, 2025\nAvailable on: Apple TV Plus\nGary Oldman and his team of MI5 rejects are coming back this year for Slow Horses season 5, which has confirmed its release date for September. We can't think of a better way to go back to school, honestly, as we get ready for more unexpected plot twists and espionage action. Based on Mick Herron's book London Rules, the new episodes of the fan-favorite Apple TV Plus show will see everyone feeling suspicious of Roddy Ho's new girlfriend, which will only be the start of a series of bizarre events happening across London. The Slow Horses will have to try to work out how everything is connected.\nChad Powers\nRelease date: September 30, 2025\nAvailable on: Hulu\nHit Man and Twisters star Glen Powell returns to the small screen with new Hulu comedy series Chad Powers. Powell stars as a disgraced college football quarterback, Russ Holliday, who disguises himself as the affable Chad Powers to join a struggling team to reboot his career. The show was co-created by Powell and Avengers: Doomsday screenwriter Michael Waldron.\nMarvel Zombies\nRelease date: October 3, 2025\nAvailable on: Disney Plus\nGet ready to usher in the spooky season with one of our most anticipated upcoming Marvel shows of the year, Marvel Zombies. We first saw the undead superheroes appear on an episode of What If...? years ago, showing us an alternate timeline where Earth's mightiest heroes (and villains) have been turned into zombies. During the series' four episodes, we'll see a group of survivors have to travel and survive on their quest to find a cure. Sign us up!\nStar Wars: Visions season 3\nRelease date: October 29, 2025\nAvailable on: Disney Plus\nOver two years after the last installment, animated anthology series Star Wars: Visions is back for a third season. Consisting of nine new episodes, three of these are sequels to season 1 episodes (The Duel, The Village Bride, and The Ninth Jedi, specifically). This time around, new animation studios enlisted behind the scenes include Polygon Pictures, who recently worked on Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, and Wit Studio, who also make Spy x Family.\nThe Diplomat season 3\nRelease date: Fall 2025\nAvailable on: Netflix\nKeri Russell returns as Kate Wyler, the US ambassador to the UK, in the third season of Netflix's hit political thriller The Diplomat. Along with returning cast members Rory Kinnear, Rufus Sewell, and Allison Janney, The West Wing's Bradley Whitford joins the cast for the new installment. \"Season 3 flips the chessboard,\" creator Debora Cahn previously told Tudum. \"In season 3, Kate lives the particular nightmare that is getting what you want.\"\nStranger Things season 5\nRelease date: November 26 (Part 1), December 25 (Part 2), December 31 (Part 3)\nAvailable on: Netflix\nStranger Things season 5 is the final installment in the hit Netflix show, which means it's not one to miss. So far, the plot is shrouded in mystery, but we're expecting an emotional send-off for the Hawkins cohort. \"We know what the ending is,\" Matt Duffer previously said during an interview with our sister publication SFX. \"It's conceivable that it changes, but I think it's unlikely because it's one of those endings that just feels, and has always felt, right. It also feels sort of inevitable. Then when you come up with it, you're like, 'Oh yeah, well, that is absolutely what it has to be.'\"\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians season 2\nRelease date: December 10, 2025\nAvailable on: Disney Plus\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians, one of Disney Plus' biggest original shows ever, finally returns for season 2 this December. Based on the series of YA books by Rick Riordan, the show follows the adventures of Percy, a tweenage demigod and the son of Poseidon, and his best friends Annabeth and Grover. After season 1's mishaps, Percy and pals return to Camp Half Blood one year later only to find more trouble waiting for them: they're under threat from Kronos, and Percy must venture into the Sea of Monsters to find the Golden Fleece to save them.\nWonder Man\nRelease date: December 2025\nAvailable on: Disney Plus\nYahya Abdul-Mateen II stars in this new Marvel show as Wonder Man, which was first announced back in 2022. The show follows Simon Williams, a superpowered actor and stuntman, who finds himself up for the role of a lifetime: the lead in a superhero TV show. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Destin Daniel Cretton and Hawkeye's Andrew Guest are on board as showrunners, and Ben Kingsley returns as Trevor Slattery.\nIt: Welcome to Derry\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nAvailable on: Max\nThis show is set to explore the origins of Pennywise, focused on the Hanlon family (Mike Hanlon is one of the kids in the Losers Club). \"It's so rich with characters and events, we thought we would do justice to the book and the fans by going back into this world,\" Andy and Barbara Muschietti told EW of the show. \"Specifically, we are telling the stories of the interludes, writings by Mike Hanlon based on his investigation that includes interviews he conducts with the older people in the town. In Welcome to Derry, we touch on the usual themes that were talked about in the movie \u2013 friendship, loss, the power of unified belief \u2013 but this story also focuses on the use of fear as a weapon, which is one of the things that is also relevant to our times.\"\nFor more on new releases, check out our lists of the most exciting movie release dates to look out for and upcoming DC movies and shows.\nI\u2019m the Deputy Entertainment Editor here at GamesRadar+, covering TV and film for the Total Film and SFX sections online.
