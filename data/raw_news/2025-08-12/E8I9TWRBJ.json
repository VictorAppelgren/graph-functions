  "content": "A misdemeanor battery case in South Florida against professional boxer Gervonta \u201cTank\u201d Davis was dropped Tuesday, a month after his arrest on the domestic violence charge.\n\nThe online docket for Miami-Dade County\u2019s clerk of court showed that the charge was dropped and the case closed.\n\nDavis, 30, was picked up shortly after midnight on July 11 near the popular Lincoln Road area of Miami Beach.\n\nDavis and his vehicle information had been added to a law enforcement database, and a license plate reader set up in Miami Beach flagged his car.\n\nMiami Beach police made the initial stop and then turned Davis over to Doral police. He was later released on a $10,000 bond.\n\nThe charge was connected to a report made in June by Davis\u2019 former domestic partner in Doral, a residential city in western Miami-Dade.\n\nAccording to a police report, the mother of his two children said Davis struck the back of her head and slapped her during an argument while she was taking one of their children out of his car.\n\nDavis, who is from Baltimore, is in the regular conversation for best pound-for-pound boxer.\n\nThe WBA lightweight champion won his first 30 bouts, 28 by knockout, with his devastating punching power drawing sellouts crowds from New York to Washington to Las Vegas.",

It was really nice to meet ya \ud83e\udd1d Never take for granted that many of my best friends are the ones I met in elementary school,\u201d Balionis, 39, captioned the Saturday post. \u201cTo take this trip with them\u2026 well I think 5th grade us would be really proud of how far we\u2019ve come, and that we continue to choose to do it together \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f also shoutout to the guys for marrying the most fun partners \ud83e\udee1.\u201d\nBalionis looked stunning in a white bikini as she enjoyed a coconut cocktail under the sun.\nOther images spotlighted group dinners, sightseeing and partying in fluorescent-lit clubs.\nBalionis took some well-deserved time off after 19 weeks on the road with \u201cGolf on CBS.\u201d\nLast week, she shared a tribute to her broadcast team, including photos from the season.\n\u201cHard to put into words what 19 weeks on the road really looks like,\u201d Balionis wrote. \u201cFor us announcers, we have it easy \u2014 we show up to work with hotel rooms already booked, everything we need waiting at check-in. Our headsets and mics work flawlessly, our sets are stocked, and our camera operators have been setting the scene for days.\u201d\nBalionis made headlines off the course last May when a Daily Mail report linked her and McIlroy after he filed for divorce from his wife of seven years, Erica Stoll.\nMcIlroy, 36, and Stoll have since reunited, and his divorce petition was voluntarily dismissed.\nFans noticed Balionis wasn\u2019t wearing her wedding ring last February while covering the Genesis Invitational.\nBalionis married former North Carolina quarterback Bryn Renner, who also had a brief career in the NFL, in 2022.\nBalionis, who wasn\u2019t wearing her ring in the Ibiza photos, has not publicly addressed speculation about a divorce, but Renner no longer appears on her social media pages.\nUs Weekly confirmed last spring that Balinois and the reigning Masters champ \u201care not dating and only have a professional relationship.\u201d\nBalionis joined CBS Sports in 2017 as a golf reporter and also serves as a sideline reporter for select NFL ON CBS games and CBS Sports Network college football games."
