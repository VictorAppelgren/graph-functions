      "summary": "The article reports that a Washington emergency hearing on President Trump’s attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook ended without a ruling, leaving the case pending further filings. Market reaction was muted but tech stocks fell, the S&P 500 slipped, and bond yields hovered near 4.2% for the 10‑year. Analysts warn that the outcome could test the Fed’s independence and influence future monetary policy, while broader political tensions—including potential government shutdowns and congressional hearings—loom. The story underscores the intersection of executive power, judicial review, and financial market stability.",
