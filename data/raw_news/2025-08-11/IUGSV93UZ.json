  "description": "Picking the right time to upgrade",
  "content": "How often do you upgrade your MacBook? I\u2019m willing to bet it\u2019s not very often, and certainly not every year. If so, that\u2019s great news for you, but perhaps not so pleasing for Apple, which would rather you stumped up for one of the best MacBooks as often as possible. Yet is there really a reason to upgrade if your laptop does everything you need for years at a time?\n\nTake me, for example. I\u2019ve had a MacBook Pro with M1 Pro chip since 2022, and it\u2019s served me superbly well in that time. It handles all my work without a hitch and gives me strong gaming performance for the titles I play. Even Cyberpunk 2077 performs impressively well if I turn frame generation on, and I\u2019m happy to do that since it boosts the frame rates from my integrated laptop chip \u2013 which is several generations out of date \u2013 up to the mid-70s.\n\nThat all means that over the past few years, I\u2019ve looked at advances in the MacBook Pro and decided to take a pass. New chips have been the only major changes of note, and with no big design adjustments or feature improvements to tempt me \u2013 and my M1 Pro chip performing so consistently \u2013 there\u2019s been no need to rock the boat.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m starting to get the feeling that this situation is not going to last. Judging by the latest rumors, things could change in a big way in the next year or two, and it might be harder than ever for me to resist the lure of a new MacBook Pro. The good news, though, is that this step up could last me well into the next decade.\n\nThat idea centers around Apple\u2019s M6 chip, which is expected to land in the MacBook Pro in late 2026 or early 2027. This model is expected to come with an OLED display as well as the new chip, according to Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman\u2019s latest Power On newsletter.\n\nThere, Gurman says that the upcoming M6 MacBook Pro \u201crepresents enough of a change to finally move the needle\u201d in his opinion, bringing with it a new chip, an improved screen, plus a thinner, redesigned chassis for the first time in several years.\n\nGurman is not the only person who could be swayed by this upcoming Mac: it\u2019s the kind of upgrade that might convince me to open the purse strings as well. After all, by the time the M6 model launches, my M1 Pro laptop will be five generations out of date and might start showing its age a little more. It\u2019s still going strong for now, but that won\u2019t be the case forever.\n\nBut the bigger change will be the OLED display. This has been rumored for years, but Apple\u2019s obsessive perfectionism has meant we still haven\u2019t seen it in action. When it finally arrives, though, Apple\u2019s gaming gains could finally be married up with the kind of visual output they deserve. The question of whether MacBooks are actually gaming machines has been discussed much over the last few years, but adding an OLED display into the mix would surely settle the question in Apple\u2019s favor once and for all.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nBut the fact that it would take an upgrade as momentous as this to convince me to get a new MacBook raises another question: what happens after the M6 MacBook Pro has been and gone?\n\nGenerally, MacBook upgrades aren\u2019t usually as feature packed as the one we\u2019re expecting when the M6 chip and OLED display come around. The M4 MacBook Pro, for example, offered a new chip, added Center Stage to the front-facing camera, brought Thunderbolt 5 connectivity to the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, added a nano-texture coating to the display\u2026 and not a whole lot else. Those changes are fine, but they\u2019re not groundbreaking.\n\nApple has, in some ways, created a problem for itself: its chips are now so performant that they can last for generations, dissuading people from upgrading. Contrast that to the bad old Intel Mac days, when the chips were so underpowered that many people felt forced into expensive annual upgrades, and it\u2019s clear that Apple users are in a better spot than ever.\n\nThese days, Apple silicon chips have a lot more longevity, which means it\u2019s harder for Apple to persuade its users to buy new MacBooks on the regular. My hope, at least, is this means Apple will bring more significant new features in the coming years in a bid to tempt upgraders.\n\nBut even if it doesn\u2019t, just having a chip that lasts years without faltering is a win for Apple fans, and my M1 Pro is a testament to that. If I upgrade to the M6 MacBook Pro and its OLED display, I\u2019m hoping the improvements it brings last me half a decade or more, just as my long-serving M1 Pro chip has done before it.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 MacBook Pro with OLED display rumored for late 2026 launch \u2014 and Samsung could make the screen\n\u2022 Love the MacBook Pro?

      "text": "The end of Intel Macs? The latest macOS 16 rumors have me worried about my 2018 MacBook Pro\nmacOS Tahoe could be a death knell for my aging MacBook\n- macOS 16 (or macOS 26) could drop support for some Intel Macs\n- Rumors suggest these will include my 2018 MacBook Pro\n- But it likely won't be the end of the road for all Intel-powered Macs yet\nMy trusty 2018 MacBook Pro has served me well over the years, processing thousands of photos and more without complaint \u2013 but the latest macOS 16 rumors suggest its days are, like most Intel-powered Macs, very much numbered.\nWWDC 2025 is now just days away and, according to a report from Apple Insider, macOS 16 \u2013 or macOS 26 Tahoe, as it seems likely to be named \u2013 will drop support for many Intel Mac models, including (sniff) mine.\nApple Insider says that \"people familiar with the matter\" have told it that only the Macs listed below will be able to run macOS 16. Notable by their absence are the 2018 MacBook Pro, 2020 Intel-based MacBook Air, 2017 iMac Pro, and 2018 Mac mini, all of which currently support the current macOS Sequoia.\n- Rumored macOS 26 compatibility list\n- MacBook Pro 2019 or later\n- MacBook Air M1 or later\n- iMac 2020 or later\n- Mac Pro 2019 or later\n- Mac mini M1 or later\n- Mac Studio\nThere are two other things to note about this list. One is that, if it is indeed accurate when Apple announces macOS 26 on June 9, it wouldn't yet mark a significant end for all Intel-powered Macs.\nThe 2019 MacBook Pro, 2020 5K iMac, and 2019 Mac Pro would all soldier on until 2026. Next year, macOS 27 may presumably then become the first desktop OS to exclusively support Apple Silicon-powered Macs, which would be a big moment if so.\nSecondly, those four Intel-powered Macs that are seemingly on the chopping block for macOS 26 wouldn't necessarily be obsolete. Apple typically continues to provide another two years of security-only updates for machines in that position, so I wouldn't necessarily have to wave goodbye to my 2018 MacBook Pro.\nAnd yet, macOS 26 will likely be the excuse I've been looking for to do just that...\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nMy next MacBook\nMoving to an Apple Silicon MacBook has been on my wishlist for a few years now, but buying one isn't exactly a $20 challenge. Still, if Apple does announce on June 9 that my 2018 MacBook Pro isn't invited to the Tahoe party, it'll likely be the nudge I need to make the leap \u2013 the other being that my MacBook is now very much showing its age.\nThere's all the usual seven-year-old laptop signs, like needing to be constantly connected to a charger and the fan going into overdrive at the merest hint of anything more taxing than three Chrome tabs. And yes, it does also have the much-maligned Touch Bar, which I've grown to like despite it being largely useless.\nBut it's really photo and video editing where my MacBook Pro is showing its advancing years. Adobe Lightroom's AI-powered noise reduction, for example, is very impressive, but applying it to one photo can take several minutes and makes the base of my laptop feel hot enough for cooking a steak dinner.\nThe question for me will likely be whether to get a MacBook Air 13-inch M4 or wait for the M5 MacBook Pro, which is expected to land later this year alongside M5 chips (possibly in \"the fall\" of 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman).\nWith the former sitting at the top of our best laptops guide (and best MacBook and Macs list) and likely offering everything I'll need (Liquid Retina display with P3 color gamut, 10-core Apple M4 chip and all-day battery life), I'm leaning towards that \u2013 particularly as it starts at a pretty reasonable $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,699. Which will somehow double when I add more RAM and storage.\nThere are also the rumors that this year's MacBook Pro M5 might be a slightly disappointing upgrade. The real fireworks are likely coming with a redesigned MacBook Pro M6 that's been tipped to land in 2026 with an OLED display, according to rumors at least.\nSo while my tired 2018 MacBook Pro isn't completely obsolete yet, the switch to an M4-powered MacBook would likely feel like a night-and-day difference \u2013 and those are now pretty rare.\nYou might also like\nMark is TechRadar's Senior news editor.

      "text": "If I'm ever going to buy another iPad, WWDC needs to bring some serious iPadOS changes\nI want Apple to go all-out for the iPad\nHow quickly five years goes by \u2013 I can scarcely believe it, but it\u2019s been almost half a decade since I picked up my 11-inch iPad Pro and second-generation Apple Pencil.\nThe approach of WWDC 2025 has brought an onslaught of rumors about Apple\u2019s upcoming operating system updates, and given the timing of the above I\u2019ve been drawn to the latest tip-offs and suggestions about iPadOS 19.\nSpeaking personally, I\u2019m pretty excited by the prospect of an iPad operating system that\u2019s tipped to be the most Mac-like iPadOS update ever \u2013 check out our recent roundup of iPadOS 19 features we want to see for a detailed breakdown.\nBut on the other hand, as a user of both Apple and Android devices, I\u2019ll believe it when I see it. Android has surpassed Apple in terms of tablet multitasking and computer compatibility so successfully that I\u2019d almost stopped hoping for any proper competition from Apple; in thes arena at least, as iPads arguably have the suprios hardware and tablet-optimized app ecosystem.\nTo be fair, in the last five years I\u2019ve put my iPad Pro to good use. It carried me through the first two years of my degree, and has been a fabulous companion for streaming video, controlling Spotify playback, and doodling on ProCreate. I\u2019ve edited audio and video, taken photos, made spreadsheets and diagrams, and scrolled through plenty of social media posts.\nBut since picking up a 16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro just over a year ago, I\u2019ve noticed my iPad usage falling steadily \u2013 to the point where its A12Z processor and still-lovely 120Hz LCD display have mostly been relegated to the status of YouTube machine.\nAs anyone who\u2019s owned an iPad knows, that\u2019s pretty much death\u2019s door for an Apple tablet, no matter the model. In the latter years of my older iPad Air (the original model released in 2013), I was using the tablet for the exact same thing, despite not having a Mac at the time, and the iPad Pro's greater power and multitasking capabilities.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nGiven five years is somewhat aged for my iPad Pro, especially as its successors moved to the powerful and efficient M-series Apple chips, I\u2019ve been eyeing up some of the best iPads as a possible successor to the Pro, and to give me a tablet that I'll use for a lot more than streaming.\nTo be honest, though, the spark I felt with my previous two Apple tablets just isn\u2019t there this time.\nThe crux of this is I don't feel there's enough 'pro' features to justify and upgrade to the latest iPad Pro, and see it become my primary device for work and play over my MacBook. Unless you absolutely need the touchscreen or Apple Pencil, I think it\u2019s quicker to get things done on the more flexible, more powerful macOS-based machine.\nThat\u2019s because iPadOS just isn't powerful enough without proper desktop-style features \u2013 its multitasking is usable, but awkward, the files app convenient, but nerfed, the ecosystem smooth, but much more closed off than a traditional desktop. Essentially, I feel in its current guise iPadOS means the iPad Pro is essentially a powered-up iPad Air rather than a MacBook replacement that would pique my interest.\nI\u2019m not the first to say that the iPad\u2019s remarkable hardware is held back by iPadOS. I'm not even the first TechRadar journalist to say so - Managing Editor, Core Tech Matt Hanson said he found that \"the power of the M4 chip largely went to waste with the iPad Pro\" earlier this year.\nI think the hardware jump from my current 11-inch iPad Pro to one of the gorgeous 2024 models, with their slim build, Tandem OLED displays, and ludicrously powerful M4 chipsets, would feel even greater than the jump from the original iPad Air to my current 2020 iPad Pro, which makes the limitations of iPadOS even more frustrating. Why invest in all that power if the software can't take advantage of it?\nSo, without being too dramatic, I think this coming WWDC is Apple\u2019s last chance to show me it really knows what it\u2019s doing with the iPad.\nWhile I\u2019d settle for new features that offer a more purposeful tablet experience while remaining entirely separate from the Mac, what I really want to see is Apple pushing the iPad towards a bolder, more capable role, leaving its \u2018YouTube machine\u2019 moniker firmly in the past.\nOne could even suggest having a separate fork to iPadOS, such as iPadOS Pro, that focuses on pro-grade multitasking, a better mouse-centric interface when using an iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard, and file management and transfer that's suitable for people doing professional work such as video editing.\nThere's always been the perceived concern that Apple wouldn't do this due to cannibalising MacBook users, but there's scope that by making iPadOS more macOS-like for iPad Pros you could get an more capable and flexible tablet that could augment one Apple product collection than dilute it; for example photographers and video editors could use an iPad Pro with a more pro-centric iPadOS to do on the fly edits or tap into powerful Apple Intelligence features, while out in the field, then move over to a MacBook Pro when back at their desk or in a more laptop-friendly environment.\nSo my hope is we see something special from Apple at WWDC that supercharges iPadOS, if not with an eye on professionals then in a fashion that really harnesses the M-series chip power to make iPadOS more distinct, and less of what's arguably a modified take on iOS 18.\nWWDC 2025 kicks off on June 9 \u2013 be sure to bookmark our how to watch WWDC 2025 guide and keep an eye on our phones coverage and tablets coverage for the latest updates.

      "text": "Cyberpunk 2077 could be the Mac gaming moment we\u2019ve been waiting for, and it\u2019s all thanks to AI\nMaking the Mac gaming dream a reality\nWe\u2019ve been hearing for months that Apple is planning to bring AAA game Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition to macOS, and yesterday we finally got a release date: it\u2019s due to arrive tomorrow, July 17. It\u2019s the news Mac gamers have been waiting a tortuously long time to hear.\nAs someone who games on both a PC and a Mac \u2013 and who absolutely loves Cyberpunk 2077 and has been playing it for years \u2013 I\u2019m super excited to try out one of the best single-player games on my Mac. Because this isn\u2019t just one of my favorite games on one of my favorite computers. No, it looks like Apple and CD Projekt Red are going above and beyond to make this an experience custom-built for Mac gamers. And that means there\u2019s a lot to look forward to.\nGame-changing performance\nAs an Apple gamer, I\u2019m used to performance that lags behind my PC. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Apple silicon has been an absolute gamechanger for Mac gaming, and I can still get decent frame rates in most games on my MacBook Pro. But despite Apple\u2019s lofty claims, it\u2019s always seemed like wishful thinking to imagine that the integrated GPU you find in Apple\u2019s Mac chips can compete with any of the best graphics cards.\nThat\u2019s why the key detail that leapt out at me from Apple\u2019s announcement was the claim that Cyberpunk 2077 will be able to run on a Mac at 120 frames per second (fps) when using ultra settings. Considering how incredibly demanding Cyberpunk 2077 is, that\u2019s bona fide gaming PC performance and would be a massive step up for Mac players.\nIf that\u2019s what you can potentially eke out of a game like Cyberpunk 2077, then other, less-demanding games could perform even better. Sure, MacBook Pro displays are limited to 120fps, but you might be able to max out all settings and still hit that refresh rate in other titles. It\u2019s an enticing thought.\nOf course, everything depends on which chips will be able to achieve this kind of output. Apple hasn\u2019t given any specifics here, but when we went hands-on with Cyberpunk 2077 on a Mac, it reached 120fps at ultra settings using an M4 Max chip. It\u2019s unlikely that lower-rated chips will hit those numbers too \u2013 I\u2019m not holding out too much hope for my M1 Pro MacBook Pro \u2013 but we\u2019ll have to see how they perform when we get some testing time with the game.\nInterestingly, software is seemingly just as important here as hardware. Yes, a high-end chip will undoubtedly help you reach those sky-high numbers, but some of the most interesting tidbits from Apple\u2019s Cyberpunk 2077 announcement were related to software.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nFor instance, Apple said that MetalFX Upscaling would be available on launch, with MetalFX Frame Interpolation and MetalFX Denoising coming later this year. Starting with MetalFX Upscaling, this renders the game at a lower level than your display\u2019s native resolution, then uses artificial intelligence (AI) to scale it up. Nvidia and AMD already have similar techs, and they do a fantastic job (in some cases, the upscaled version actually looks better than the original), so this could be a major boost for macOS.\nMetalFX Denoising, meanwhile, will allow \u201creal time path tracing on the game\u2019s highest quality graphics settings,\u201d Apple says, and that\u2019s something that could provide an incredible boost to visual fidelity.\nThe AI revolution\nWhat\u2019s fascinating to me is that these are all AI technologies. They come at a time when Apple\u2019s headline AI (specifically, Apple Intelligence) is widely perceived to be seriously lagging behind rivals like ChatGPT and Copilot.\nYet while most people envisage chatbots when they think of AI, artificial intelligence is actually far broader, as these gaming techs show. Apple has long been a strong AI performer \u2013 its image processing and Siri suggestions being two examples you\u2019ve likely encountered on an iPhone.\nOf course, we don\u2019t yet know how well all of these MetalFX techs will perform, with MetalFX Frame Interpolation and Denoising not expected until later this year. But they could counter the argument that Apple is falling behind in AI (a contention that was never the full picture anyway).\nOf these AI features, MetalFX Frame Interpolation is the one that has piqued my interest the most. Apple says this generates a new frame for every two input frames, resulting in much smoother gameplay than you would normally be able to achieve.\nThis is sure to reignite the impassioned \u201cfake frames\u201d debate that has been playing out ever since Nvidia and AMD introduced their own frame-generation features. Yet provided Apple can avoid stutters and jerkiness, I think this is unlikely to bother Mac gamers \u2013 for most Apple fans, being able to enjoy smooth framerates on Mac hardware is likely to outweigh any high-level concerns about whether the frames are \u201creal\u201d or \u201cfake.\u201d The true test will be at more modest hardware levels rather than the M4 Max and M3 Ultra we\u2019ve seen Cyberpunk played on so far.\nA serious gaming test\nAnd then there are all the other interesting additions that are unique to the Apple edition. This version comes with \u201cdynamically calibrated HDR optimized for Apple XDR displays,\u201d Apple says, alongside Spatial Audio with head tracking (providing you\u2019re listening with a pair of the best AirPods), plus \u201cFor this Mac\u201d graphical presets that are \u201cindividually optimized for every Apple Silicon Mac model.\u201d\nThat all makes me think that Apple is trying to do this the right way. It\u2019s making use of its other products and adding its own techs that are tailor-made for its devices, rather than just plugging in upscaling and frame generation tools from Nvidia or AMD and hoping for the best.\nThe last few years have shown that Apple is taking Mac gaming seriously. Cyberpunk 2077 will be the sternest test of that commitment \u2013 but if Apple does it right, it could also be its biggest success story so far.\nYou might also like\nAlex Blake has been fooling around with computers since the early 1990s, and since that time he's learned a thing or two about tech.

      "text": "I just experienced super-smooth Cyberpunk 2077 at Ultra settings on a Mac, but the developers say there\u2019s more to \u2018squeeze out\u2019 of Apple Silicon\nHow CD Projekt RED turned a MacBook Pro into a gaming laptop for Cyberpunk 2077\nWe\u2019ve known that Cyberpunk 2077 is eventually coming to the Mac, and developers CD Projekt Red (CDPR) have been hard at work \u2013 and still are \u2013 at getting the title fit to run on any Apple Silicon-powered device. That means the massive AAA title, which has been frequently used to benchmark systems, will be able to run on the M1 chip or newer.\nIt was reconfirmed at WWDC 2025 \u2013 Apple\u2019s week-long developer conference \u2013 that it would be arriving later this year, and back with the launch of the new Mac Studio, TechRadar saw a demo of it running on that super-powered computer.\nNow, though, I had the chance to get another demo of Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition \u2013 a newer version of the in-development title \u2013 on a 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 Max chip and 128GB of RAM.\nIt was on \u2018Ultra\u2019 settings with a buttery smooth and excellently rendered 120 frames per second. And yes, this performance is derived from Apple\u2019s M4 Max chip \u2013 no discrete GPU required. Further, this was fully taking advantage of Apple's Metal 4, coming later this year, including MetalFX Frame Interpolation.\nIt looked fantastic and was responsive, but that had me thinking about the plans to launch this on any Apple Silicon Mac.\nI was curious about performance on less powerful chips within Apple\u2019s lineup, as the requirement for the title is expected to be Apple Silicon, meaning it should run base M1, M2, M3, or M4 chips as well as the more powerful creations.\nI asked Pawel Sasko, Associate Game Director of CD Projekt Red, about what performance might look like on other Macs with different levels of performance from various chips, like even a MacBook Air.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nHe first explained that Cyberpunk 2077 is running on CDPR\u2019s proprietary Red Engine Four, which is designed to be scalable. \u201cIt's trying to use everything that given platform provides,\u201d Sasko explained and called out that the title is available on a variety of devices already, including the Nintendo Switch 2 ahead of its release on the Mac.\n\"Red engine is basically trying to check what hardware you have and squeeze out the max you can have,\u201d he continued. Meaning that Cyberpunk 2077 will work to run and deliver the best performance based on the chip you have inside. Sasko couldn\u2019t give a specific number yet based on the chip or a potential Mac SKU, but that\u2019s because the game is still not finalized \u2013 CDPR is still working on it and polishing it.\nSasko even shared that they\u2019ll work on optimizing performance until the very end, and recently CDPR figured out how to optimize cloth, also known as what a character is wearing, to make it look better.\nSuffice to say, he shared that \u201cWe're trying to squeeze everything that given hardware gives us,\u201d meaning it will run the best it possibly can on the Mac \u2013 which likely means that a more powerful chip, like an M4, M4 Pro, or M4 Max, will deliver the best results.\nAnd the good news is that we\u2019re likely only a few months away from one of the biggest AAA titles arriving on the Mac \u2013 the CDPR team wouldn\u2019t give an exact time frame, but Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will arrive in 2025.\nI also got to see this demo of the title shortly after Apple unveiled macOS 26 Tahoe, which will introduce the Games app. Although CDPR hasn\u2019t announced if it will be integrating with the new hub, it will work with the new \u2018Game Overlay.\u2019\nThis is a sidebar that can be brought to the top right-hand side of the screen, making it easy to enable game mode, adjust brightness or volume, and even switch controllers, as well as connect with friends.

      "text": "MacBooks are now legitimate gaming machines \u2013 and the future looks promising\nI was blown away with how well Death Stranding runs on a MacBook Air\nWe live in times when tech firms will more often than not leave us disappointed; such is the nature of iterative technology upgrades and product cycles. So I was fully prepared to be disapproved by an attempt to run Death Stranding on my aging MacBook Air 13-inch (M2).\nLast year, Apple touted how the 2019 game, which originally launched on the PS4, was coming to both macOS and iOS.\nNow, Death Stranding is a rather attractive open-world game with a good few systems at play, and it has the added need of rendering actors Norman Reedus and L\u00e9a Seydoux, among others, with solid realism. It\u2019s not a game for a bit of low effort porting, so I\u2019d prepared myself for disappointment.\nThanks to the move to in-house Apple silicon, modern Mac and MacBooks have buckets of performance to tap into \u2013 be that for battery efficiency or handling a mass of Chrome tabs or some professional video rendering. Of course, one\u2019s mileage varies depending on the generation of chip and whether it\u2019s an M-series with a 'Pro' or 'Max' suffix (those offer the most power).\nWhile I\u2019ve been thoroughly impressed by the M2 chip in my MacBook Air, it\u2019s mostly been for how well it handles everyday tasks and sips power \u2013 at least compared to Windows laptops I\u2019ve used. It can also run Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, which is no mean feat, and handles the likes of Divinity Original Sin 2 with aplomb.\nStill, I was concerned that a more graphically ambitious game would prove too much for my MacBook.\nReader, I was wrong.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nOut-stranding\nBooting up Death Stranding, I was surprised at how smooth everything felt \u2013 there were no odd audio glitches or stutters, as can happen in my experience when running demanding games on Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. Positive first steps, then.\nOnce the game got up and running, and after an oddball opening sequence that\u2019s very much in keeping with the style of director Hideo Kojima, I was dropped into the boots of futuristic delivery man Sam Porter Bridges\u2019 boots.\nAnd, to my surprise, the game ran at what I felt was a steady 30 frames per second \u2013 sure, not the smooth 60 fps I like, but more than playable. This was at a resolution of 2560 x 1440 and with graphics settings turned up to their highest settings.\nNow, playing a game with the kind of expansive vistas that Death Stranding sports on a 13.6-inch display isn\u2019t the best way to experience it. But the impressive colors the Retina display on my Air manages, despite being an LCD panel, helped make some of the wet and green landscapes of North America pop with punchy dark greens, blues, yellows, and grays.\nAt 30 fps Death Stranding \u2013 at least so far \u2013 feels very playable. Plus I\u2019m sure I could squeeze out more if I dig into the graphics settings.\nIt\u2019s also seriously impressive that I\u2019m running a game of this calibre on a fanless laptop, where previously it would take a dedicated games console to kick Death Stranding into gear. So yeah, I was impressed and had to put my skepticism to bed.\nMore than all of that though, is how this shows the promise for proper gaming on MacBooks.\nMac gaming has arrived\nWith Apple's in-house designed chips showcasing that they are more than just great slices of silicon for getting stuff done, and have the graphical grunt for gaming, I could see a decent future for actually gaming on Macs.\nNow I don\u2019t expect custom Windows PCs to be replaced by Macs, no matter how powerful the latter get. But I do see MacBooks being viable gaming machines if more games are ported over to run on M-series chips, either via the App Store on Stream.\nI like the idea of a MacBook being a form of secondary device to game on when you don\u2019t want to be hunched over a desktop PC. Or as a machine that goes from work to play when on a trip away from home; perhaps replacing the need to carry the likes of the Steam Deck or Nintendo Switch, especially when dealing with limited luggage capacity.\nBut beyond that, I think there\u2019s scope for Apple Arcade to be expanded to include games that are made from the ground up to run on M-series chips. This might go against the initial idea behind the \u2018Arcade\u2019 moniker, which suggested that the subscription service was able to offer the same games on all manner of Apple devices. But it could open up a new tier of gaming for Macs.\nThere\u2019s a slight wrinkle in that I\u2019ve been waiting for gaming to improve on Macs for a while, what with the introduction of the Metal graphics API, but it\u2019s only just feeling like it's getting to a noteworthy level. So it could be a case that we\u2019ll need to wait a few more years before we see any significant changes.\nBut I\u2019m hopeful for a future where gaming on Mac is less of an afterthought, and the laughable proposition it once was is left thoroughly in the rear mirror.\nYou might also like\n- I spent four hours with Nintendo Switch 2, and it hasn't just exceeded my expectations \u2013 it's blown them away\n- Intel\u2019s latest boasts about its integrated graphics makes me less excited for the Nintendo Switch 2 - and more hyped for the MSI Claw 8 AI+\n- Grand Theft Auto 6 release date confirmed, but it's been delayed - here's why\nRoland Moore-Colyer is Managing Editor at TechRadar with a focus on phones and tablets, but a general interest in all things tech, especially those with a good story behind them.

A new model could be on the way, with some significant upgrades\nOLED may finally be coming!\n- A newly redesigned MacBook Pro is rumored to arrive in 2026\n- If leaks are accurate, it will feature an OLED display and a thinner chassis\n- This redesign will also be powered by Apple's M6 silicon\nIt could finally be happening, folks: the long-awaited OLED MacBook is finally on the way, if new claims from renowned Apple leaker Mark Gurman are to be believed.\nGurman has claimed in his latest Power On newsletter for Bloomberg that Apple is planning a major overhaul to the MacBook Pro in 2026, which will deliver several noteworthy changes \u2013 and chief among them is the introduction of a Tandem OLED display designed by Samsung, the same type seen on last year's new iPad Pro 13-inch.\nIt may also ditch the 'notch' in the screen for the webcam in favor of a floating 'hole cut' camera \u2013 perhaps adopting something more similar to the Dynamic Island seen on modern iPhones.\nThat's not all, though: Gurman's sources also state that the new MacBook Pro will feature a thinner design than previous models, stating that Apple \"had once hoped to release this new version in 2025\".\nIn other words, next year's MacBook Pro could look very different from the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro we reviewed back in November. But how does Apple plan to make its pro-grade laptop even more compact without sacrificing power? The answer could lie with the M6 chip.\nPowered up\nYes, Gurman also believes that these next-gen MacBook Pros will come featuring the M6 chip (presumably also with M6 Pro and M6 Max versions) - implying that we can expect M5 MacBooks this year, without the OLED upgrade.\nThe M6 chips will be the first laptop processors from Apple that utilize chip fabricator TSMC's new 2nm process (alongside the expected A20 chips for iPhones). The 2nm process is expected to bring new developments in both performance and power efficiency, which could explain how Apple expects the M6 chips to run at a high performance level even in a thinner MacBook.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAs for the MacBook Air, there's no news on any potential M5 or M6 variants, but we have to assume that they'll be in the works; after all, the new M4 MacBook Air didn't arrive on the scene until several months after the M4 chip landed in MacBook Pro and iPad Pro models. However, a previous report we covered claims that an OLED MacBook Air is still on the way, though it won't use the same Tandem OLED panel as the Pro and will likely arrive in 2027 or later - something that would align with Apple's existing release cadence, if the OLED MacBook Pro does indeed land in late 2026.\nYou might also like...\nChristian is TechRadar\u2019s UK-based Computing Editor.

And that Samsung's investment in this production capability allows for a suitably attractive manufacturing cost when it comes to that all-important bill-of-materials for the MacBook.\nObviously, we need to be careful around any rumor, but this isn't the first time we've heard Samsung's name mentioned as the maker of the MacBook's OLED screen.\nIn March 2025, well-known Apple leaker Mark Gurman predicted that the big change for the MacBook Pro won't be coming until late in 2026 - with a major redesign centering on a Samsung 'tandem' OLED (two panels squished together, as it were, to allow for better brightness and power efficiency), as well as making the laptop thinner.\nFurthermore, Apple may trade out the 'notch' in the screen for a 'hole cut' webcam.\nAnalysis: Shifting timeframes, perhaps - but there's one constant\nThis year's MacBook Pro will supposedly be a minor upgrade - if indeed the notebook refresh even arrives in 2025, as another (very recent) piece of speculation from Gurman suggests it has been delayed to early 2026. This will be the MacBook Pro M5, and the OLED model will, in theory, come late in 2026 with the M6 chip onboard.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nOf course, take all of this with a grain of salt, as that would be rather unusual in terms of launch timing for Apple - but that doesn't mean it can't happen.\nIn short, the rumor mill has got somewhat confused about exactly what Apple's MacBook plans are in terms of launch dates - perhaps because the company is tinkering with those plans and moving timeframes internally.\nWhatever the case, one rumor has remained fairly constant, which is that the MacBook Pro is going to get OLED first, and this will happen late in 2026 - with Samsung now consistently being mentioned as the manufacturer of the screen.\nYou might also like\nDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

We found performance across the board to be exceptional, whether you're using it for running office apps or video editing. Like most MBPs, it's also available in 14-inch and 16-inch models, and the display remains one of the best you can get on any laptop, period.\nBut in general, if you just need a decent all-rounder, you can't really go wrong with any M-series MacBook Pro (avoid the MacBook Pro Intel laptops, though). Even the older M1 chips are great for productivity and creative workloads.\nIn this round-up, I've included some of the best MacBook and Macs, the best business Mac and MacBook, and best video editing Mac and MacBook that we've reviewed. As part of our testing process, we've benchmarked performance, timed batter lift, and explored the full capabilities of Apple's premiere laptop.\nQuick List\nBest overall\nThe best MacBook Pro overall\nThe MacBook Pro 14-inch with the latest M4-series chips offers outstanding, best-in-class performance while getting fantastic battery life and features the best display of any MacBook ever.\nBest on a budget\nThe best MacBook Pro on a budget\nWith the release of the M4-powered MBP, I'm seeing some great deals on the previous M3 models, and it's still an incredible workstation for Apple fans.\nBest for creators\nThe best MacBook Pro for creators\nPerfect for creative professionals, the MacBook Pro 16-inch with the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips is Apple's most powerful laptop on the market. Expect staggering performance.\nBest M3\nThe best MacBook Pro with M3 chip\nLooking for an M3-powered MacBook Pro? This one comes equipped with the exceptional M3 Pro or M3 Max chip, delivering incredible performance - and that gorgeous display, too.\nBest M2\nThe best MacBook Pro with M2 chip\nThe early-2023 MacBook Pro 14-inch isn't as powerful as the M3-series models released later that same year, but it's still a fantastic performer that you'll likely find on sale.\nBest entry-level\nThe best entry-level MacBook Pro\nThe MacBook Pro 14-inch with M1 Pro might be harder to find than newer models, but if you can find this powerhouse on clearance, it'll be well worth the effort.\nThe best MacBook Pro overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe new MacBook Pro 14in, powered by Apple's M4 chip, particularly the high-end M4 Max processor, is more than just a new laptop; it's a testament to the chip's raw power. The highest-end configurations showcase superior performance due to their additional CPU and GPU cores and large memory capacity (128GB). While the base M4 model still offers advanced features like hardware-based ray tracing, mesh shading, and a fast neural network, it has fewer cores and less memory.\nThis MacBook Pro stands out for its design, including an option for a fingerprint-resistant Space Black finish, a highly praised keyboard, and the macOS Sequoia platform, offering versatility for various activities. It's considered the best MacBook to date.\nIn our experience, the complete MacBook Pro M4 series, from the base model to the M4 Pro and M4 Max, rank among the top laptops available, not just the best MacBook Pro devices, with the M4 Max configuration also a contender for the best gaming laptop list and the best portable workstation due to it's raw power and ability.\nI've opted for the 14-inch version here, as I feel it nicely balances price and performance, but there is a 16-inch model for those who want the larger screen and more configuration options.\nRead our full MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4) review\nThe best MacBook Pro on a budget\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFor a cheap MacBook Pro with a modern performance, you can pick up a last-gen model with the M3 processor for a reasonable price. It's not as powerful as the newer (and more expensive) M4 versions, but for everything from office work to video editing, the MacBook Pro 14-inch M3 is still a mighty laptop.\nLike any MacBook Pro, this laptop excels at graphically-intensive work. However, we found it was also very capable at gaming. In common with modern MacBooks, it also boasts one of the best screens on a laptop, with the Liquid Retina Display featuring wide color gamut, True Tone technology, and ProMotion technology providing a 120Hz refresh rate.\nFor an even cheaper MacBook Pro, the M1 and M2 models are still very much worth exploring, however, I'm finding them harder to buy these days unless they're refurbed. These older machines may lack the power of the newer models, but performance is still excellent overall. For a cheap non-Pro version, see our MacBook Air M4 review, a top pick at an excellent price if your needs are more simple.\nRead our full MacBook Pro 14-inch (M3 Max) review\nThe best MacBook Pro for creators\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe MacBook Pro 16, powered by Apple\u2019s M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, takes high-performance laptops to the next level. If you opt for the M4 Max configuration, you\u2019re getting unmatched power - featuring advanced CPU and GPU cores and up to 128GB of unified memory. It\u2019s purpose-built to handle anything you throw at it, from 3D rendering and massive simulations to high-end video editing projects. If you're a creative professional, it's the one to choose.\nThe 16-inch Liquid Retina XDR display is an absolute showstopper. It\u2019s the biggest and brightest display in Apple\u2019s line-up, delivering stunning color accuracy, 1,600 nits of peak brightness, and buttery-smooth ProMotion technology. Whether you\u2019re a creative pro or a multitasking powerhouse, the screen\u2019s spacious layout gives you the room to focus and create like never before.\nAnd let\u2019s talk about the Space Black finish. It\u2019s as stylish as it is functional. Thanks to the fingerprint-resistant anodized coating, it stays clean and sleek no matter how much you use it. If you\u2019re after ultimate performance, versatility, and a laptop that can keep up with your creativity, this is the one to beat.\nSure, the MacBook Pro 16-inch (M4 Pro/Max) doesn\u2019t come cheap, but it\u2019s built for those who demand the best. For a slightly cheaper alternative, the M3 Max model is also worth considering, and scores very high in the performance stakes.\nRead the full Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M4 Pro) review\nThe best MacBook Pro M3\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOnce the top-end MacBook Pro, the M3 Max-powered model is still incredibly impressive machine and if you're looking for pure power for slightly less than the M4 Max models, we can't recommend this one enough.\nThe MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3) boasts an exceptional 16.2-inch display with Liquid Retina XDR technology, 1,600 nits peak brightness, and 120Hz ProMotion tech, ensuring a vivid and responsive visual experience. It also features a range of ports for enhanced connectivity.\nThe MacBook Pro is a powerhouse in performance. During our review process, this MBP laptop effortlessly handled intensive tasks like editing 4K footage, and in a major shift, even proved capable of running the latest games. Compared to the M1 Max, our own benchmark tests showed a 35% increase in Geekbench 6 in single core CPU performance, and an increase of 69% in multi-core performance. We also ran our standard battery life test, where the laptop shone, delivering more than 24 hours of life on a single charge. Now that's impressive (although it lasted less when gaming compared to less intensive tasks.\nThe MacBook Pro M3 Max is, admittedly, an expensive device, and not everyone will require the sort of power and performance on offer here. But for those that do, this one gets a strong recommendation.\nRead our full Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3 Max) review\nThe best MacBook Pro M2\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPowered by the impressive M2 Pro and M2 Max processor, we found this Apple MacBook Pro to provide blistering speeds and buttery smooth running of everything from productivity and office apps to video and photo editing software. Yes, the design is effectively identical to its predecessor, but that bump in specs is noticeable.\nAs usual, build quality is excellent here. It feels robust and durable in hand, and it's a real pleasure using the keyboard and trackpad, too. However, the truly eye-catching thing about this laptop - and, indeed, all the best MacBook Pro devices - is that screen. With its 3024 x 1964 resolution, Liquid Retina XDR display and mini-LED technology, the results are stunning, and during our review, we found it capably delivers vibrant colors and a rich, deep contrast. Elsewhere on the machine, you'll find a fair amount of ports. The selection, which includes three Thunderbolt 4 ports and a HDMI port, should satisfy most users without restriction.\nPerformance-wise, the M2 Pro easily handles heavy workloads - and few will need the absolute power of the M2 Max, although the option is nice to have for, say, professional video editing at high resolutions.\nRead our full Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M2 Pro) review\nThe best entry-level MacBook Pro\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe MacBook Pro 14-inch powered by the original M1 chip is still an impressive beast, despite being three model generations behind the current line-up. Even today, it's a stand-out MBP for creative professionals editing images, videos, and running office apps.\nThis model remains a compelling device, especially for those who may find it on clearance. If you can get one powered by Apple's M1 Pro or M1 Max chips, you'll find - as we did - that it outperforms the base Apple M2 processor. The device features a comprehensive array of ports, addressing a common grievance among users of previous generations by eliminating the dependency on dongles and hubs for peripheral connections.\nWith three Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI, SDXC card slot, and MagSafe 3 for charging, it caters adeptly to the needs of professionals requiring a robust mobile workstation for a more modest investment than newer models demand.\nThis MacBook Pro not only boasts superior internal hardware but also introduces an upgraded Liquid Retina XDR display with mini-LED technology, akin to that in the latest iPad Pro, offering an impressive 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio and ProMotion technology for refresh rates up to 120Hz. This ensures stunning visual quality, whether for editing HDR content, scrolling through websites, or engaging in any task that benefits from vibrant colors and fluid motion.\nAdditionally, when we ran our tests, we found battery life extends to 17 hours, a notable feat for a mobile workstation of this caliber, allowing it to maintain performance without throttling to conserve power. Despite its premium pricing at launch, the MacBook Pro 14-inch (M1) remains an unrivaled option for professionals needing exceptional performance and functionality. Its blend of power, design, and utility makes it an excellent investment, particularly if available at a reduced price, underscoring its status as not just an older model, but a timeless piece of technology offering outstanding value.\nRead our full Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M1) review\nBest MacBook Pro laptops: Compared\nModel | CPU | GPU | RAM | Screen | Storage | Dimensions |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4) | Apple M4 \u2013 M4 Max | Integrated GPU | Up to 128GB | 14-inch Liquid Retina XDR display | Up to 8TB | 12.31 x 8.71 x 1.55 in / 31.26 x 22.12 x 1.55 cm |\nApple MacBook Pro 13-inch (M2) | Apple M2 with 8-core CPU | Integrated 10-core GPU | Up to 24GB | 13.3-inch display, 2560 x 1600 | Up to 2TB | 11.97 x 8.36 x 0.61 in / 30.41 x 21.24 x 1.56 cm |\nApple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M4 Pro) | Apple M3 Pro \u2013 M3 Max | Integrated GPU | Up to 128GB | 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display, 3456 x 2234 | Up to 8TB | 14.01 x 9.77 x .66 in / 35.57 x 24.81 x 1.68 cm |\nApple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3 Max) | Apple M3 Pro \u2013 M3 Max | Integrated GPU | Up to 128GB | 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display, 3456 x 2234 | Up to 8TB | 14.01 x 9.77 x .66 in / 35.57 x 24.81 x 1.68 cm |\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M2 Pro) | Apple M2 Pro (10-core) - Apple M2 Max (12-core) | Up to 38-core GPU | Up to 96GB | 14-inch Liquid Retina XDR display | Up to 8TB | 12.31 x 8.71 x 1.55 in / 31.26 x 22.12 x 1.55 cm |\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M1) | Apple M1 Pro - Apple M1 Max | Up to 32-core GPU | Up to 64GB | 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display, 3024 x 1964 | Up to 8TB | 0.61 x 12.31 x 8.71 inches / 1.55 x 31.26 x 22.12 cm |\nThe best MacBook Pro: FAQs\nMacBook Pro versus MacBook Air: which is better?\nWhile the MacBook Air is a fantastic and ultra-portable laptop at a great price, it is not really geared for the highest level of creative professionals, so it might not have the memory, storage, and processing power you'll need for the top end creative workflows.\nIf you need to do serious creative content work, or if you need a machine that will stand the test of time and you're willing to invest a bit more than a MacBook Air, the MacBook Pro is the way to go. If this is the case, pair with the best monitors for MacBook Pro for the absolute in color fidelity, expanding your digital workspace to an even larger display.\nIs the MacBook Pro good for gaming?\nIt really depends on the laptop model and the type of games you want to play. You're unlikely to get the same level of performance at max settings on most of the best MacBook Pro compared to the best gaming laptops.\nSaying that, though, using a MacBook Pro laptop for gaming has come on leaps and bounds, and is set to only get even better.\nOur News Editor Jacob tried playing Cyberpunk 2077 on a MacBook Pro 16-inch with the M4 Max. You can check out what he discovered by clicking here, but essentially, performance proved excellent.\nHe said: \"It was on \u2018Ultra\u2019 settings with a buttery smooth and excellently rendered 120 frames per second. And yes, this performance is derived from Apple\u2019s M4 Max chip \u2013 no discrete GPU required. Further, this was fully taking advantage of Apple's Metal 4, coming later this year, including MetalFX Frame Interpolation. It looked fantastic and was responsive.\"\nHow long does a MacBook Pro last?\nIn short, it should last years and years. They are expensive, but I tend to think of them as being investment laptops.\nCouple the specs with a robust and well-built chassis and you're looking at a long-lasting machine.\nI still recommend M1-powered MacBook Pro laptops, which came out at the tail-end of 2020, because while they're not the latest and greatest, performance remains exceptional.\nWhich MacBook Pro processor is best?\nThis isn't as straightforward a question as it might seem, honestly. The MacBook Pro 14-inch with an M4-series chip is our top pick, but an M2 Max MacBook Pro is going to outperform an M3 or M3 Pro chip, even though these were released more recently. It all depends on your performance needs and your budget, since older models might be cheaper than current models while still giving you the level of performance you need.\nIt's truly up to you and your needs, budget, and current deals going on. The MacBook Pro notoriously runs for quite some time, so don't feel like just because a new model dropped that your previous generation is going to bite the dust anytime soon.\nShould I get a MacBook Pro with an Intel chip?\nI wouldn't recommend it. While they're a lot cheaper, they're also far slower (and older). If you're going for an Intel processor, opt for a Windows laptop instead.\nIt really wasn't until the launch of the Apple Silicon system-on-chip that MacBooks really showed off what they're truly capable of - we've loved every M-series MacBook Pro we've tested when it comes to performance.\nHow to choose the best MacBook Pro for you\nThe two key factors to keep in mind when choosing a MacBook Pro is price and performance, since the designs and displays of each MacBook Pro on our list are similar enough that you won't find much difference there. Only slight differences in design, port offering, transfer speeds and specs.\nOlder models will be cheaper, as will smaller sizes, so if you're on a more restricted budget, the M2-series MacBook Pros in 13-inch and 14-inch are great, and you can get up to an M2 Max in a 15-inch MacBook Pro. If you've got a lot of room in your budget, a 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Max is going to be the best you can get and will last you much longer than other models might, which is great for future-proofing, however it is also going to be the most expensive, by far.\nFor memory and storage, unless you're doing substantial video editing work with very large source files at high resolutions, you shouldn't need more than 24GB or 32GB of memory, and 1TB storage is going to be more than enough for most users. Video pros will definitely need a minimum of 32GB and 2TB, and higher memory and storage configurations are recommended.\nIf you do a lot of cloud-based work, or don't work with heavy files, you can get away with smaller storage sizes, or you can use some of the best external hard drives for Mac expanding your storage for cheaper than you may find internal storage to be.\nAt the end of the day, decide what is priority, be it the processor, storage, ports, or screen, and then look for the right combination based on that. For most, any MacBook Pro is more than enough, so pay attention to what is needed, and go from there.\nFor more laptop peripherals, see our reviews of the best MacBook Pro accessories.\nHow we test the best MacBook Pro laptops\n\u2705 More than 1,800 laptops, Chromebooks, and MacBooks reviewed\n\u2705 15 years of product testing\n\u2705 Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2705 Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nWe put all the MacBook Pro models we review through our standard battery of benchmark tests to score their processing power, both in absolute synthetic terms but also with workloads like video editing, 3D rendering, and others.\nTraditionally, MacBooks are some of the best laptops for photo editing, best video editing laptops, and best laptops for graphic design - so we're always keen to see how the latest models perform in the creative arena.

      "text": "Bad news, Apple fans \u2013 the M5 MacBook Pro may not launch until 2026\nAn untimely delay\n- Apple\u2019s M5 MacBook Pro might have been delayed until 2026\n- No reason has been given for the apparent postponement\n- It means Apple might launch two MacBook Pro models next year\nFor the last few years, Apple has launched a new MacBook Pro in the fall like clockwork \u2013 but this year, that could all change. That\u2019s because a new report has claimed that the M5 MacBook Pro might be pushed back to early 2026, with Apple supposedly \u201cinternally targeting\u201d that date instead of the regular late-year release window.\nThe surprising news comes from Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman, who has been a reliable source of Apple leaks and rumors in the past. Gurman\u2019s latest report contradicts his earlier reporting, which suggested that the M5 MacBook Pro would be unveiled near the tail end of 2025. That implies that something has changed Apple\u2019s mind on when to push the new laptop into the limelight.\nGurman hasn\u2019t provided a reason for the delay, so the cause of Apple\u2019s decision is anyone\u2019s guess. That said, the reporter noted that the timing is \u201cfluid,\u201d which suggests there\u2019s a chance that the next MacBook Pro could make an appearance before this 2025 is over.\nStill, launching a MacBook Pro early in the year is not without precedent, as the M2 MacBook Pro, for example, was released in January 2023. Still, that model has been the exception in the Apple silicon era, with the M1, M3 and M4 MacBook Pro editions all coming out in the fall.\nDisappointing delays\nWhat could be causing this delay? Gurman didn\u2019t offer any hints here, and it\u2019s not immediately clear what Apple\u2019s thought process might be.\nThe M5 MacBook Pro is likely to be a minor update, with new Apple\u2019s M5 chip being the main differentiator between it and the M4 MacBook Pro. That means issues with the chip could be one of the main reasons for the delay. Alternatively, Apple might simply be holding the device over until 2026 for sales reasons.\nNext year could be a big one for the MacBook Pro, with a redesigned model expected to arrive in late 2026. This version is slated to come with a new design and an OLED display, marking the biggest update to the MacBook Pro since the last overhaul in 2021.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nBut with the M5 MacBook Pro potentially creeping into 2026, we\u2019ll have to see whether the OLED MacBook Pro also gets punted into the long grass as a result.\nYou might also like\n- The MacBook Pro could get Apple\u2019s M5 chip before the iPad Pro, but don\u2019t expect groundbreaking changes\n- MacBook Pro M5 next year might be disappointing as rumor suggests the real fireworks are coming with MacBook Pro M6 with OLED in 2026\n- Love the MacBook Pro?

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 is a pro-grade portable that impresses in every area. It's a pleasure to use, and rises to meet virtually any challenge. It joins Apple's pantheon of excellent laptops, and will duly take its place at or near the top of our best laptops list.\nPros\n- +\nM4\n- +\nNano-texture screen\n- +\nCenterstage camera\n- +\nExcellent design\nCons\n- -\nNo design updates\n- -\nNo Wi-Fi 7\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 (2024) : Two-minute review\nApple's MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 is the full package, a near-perfect blend of price, performance, and utility. The M4 is the base edition of the newest and most powerful generation of Apple silicon (it's the same chip that's already running in the iPad Pro 13-inch) but it's still bursting with power, and more than capable of doing most of the heavy-lifting you want from a pro-level portable machine, as ready to edit raw photos and 4K video as it is to stand in as an able gaming console.\nI've long been a fan of the MacBook Pro design, especially since Apple refined it by removing the Touch Bar, a neat innovation that never reached its full potential. My M4 Pro review unit, supplied by Apple, is a sleek-looking Space Black that's both elegant and wonderfully functional. The Magic Keyboard is still a typing gem, and I love the massive trackpad and all that space for resting my hands. And the stereo speakers that straddle the keyboard deliver powerful, crisp, and clear audio that could provide the soundtrack for your party in a pinch.\nWhen I think about the reasons why you'd buy an M4 14-inch Mac Pro over the cheaper M3-running MacBook Air, the list is smaller than when I've compared the Pro and Air options previously, but there are a handful of standout features that make this MacBook Pro 14 M4 (2024) a near-perfect choice.\nFor starters, you have the ports. Where the Air tops out at a Thunderbolt 3 port, you get a trio of speedy Thunderbolt 4 ports with the MacBook Pro (you'll need to upgrade to the M4 Pro model for Thunderbolt 5). You also gain the SD card slot, an instant bonus for photo and video professionals. The larger body and ever-efficient 3-nanometer system-on-a-chip (SoC) means a promised 24 hours of battery life \u2013 for a Pro-level system, that's unheard of. Naturally, real-world usage times varied widely in my testing based on activity (AAA gaming can quickly eat up battery).\nThe biggest difference between Air and Pro might be the display. This Liquid Retina XDR is an inch larger than the MacBook Air's, and it offers a nano-texture option (an extra $150 / \u00a3150 / AU$230), something I highly recommend for cutting down on reflections in almost any situation.\nWith the MacBook Pro 14-inch M4, Apple has created a pro-grade portable that impresses in every respect. It joins Apple's pantheon of outstanding laptops, and is set to take a well-deserved place at or near the top of our best laptops rankings.\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 (2024) review: Price and availability\n- Starts at $1,599 / \u00a32,149 / AU$3,199\n- Nano-texture (which you want) will run you another $150 / \u00a3150 / AU$230\nApple unveiled the M4 MacBook Pro 14-inch on October 30, along with the new MacBook Pro 16-inch, Mac mini, and iMac. All these new Macs are running variations of Apple's M4 silicon.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nPricing for the M4 MacBook Pro 14-inch starts at $1,599 / \u00a31,599 / AU$2,499 for the base configuration, which comes with the standard M4 chip and 16GB of unified memory.

Where competitors often try different and sometimes odd design flourishes, Apple carefully peeled away all but what matters, leaving a MacBook Pro that looks and feels as if it was carved from a couple of pieces of 100% recycled black aluminum. Nothing feels like, or works like, it was left to chance. That impression starts when you put your finger under the lip of the display and flip open the clamshell to reveal the screen and keyboard. That hinge is as sure as it gets, offering the perfect blend of tension and smooth movement.\nAt 3.4lbs / 1.55kg, the MacBook Pro 14 M4 is not the lightest laptop or even the lightest MacBook. The excellent MacBook Air holds that distinction, and if you prize portability over power you might be reading the wrong review. On the other hand, the MacBook Pro 14 is by no means heavy (the 16-inch MacBook Pro, by contrast, weighs nearly 5lbs / 2.27kg).\nFolded close, the MacBook Pro 14 is just 0.61 inches tall, 12.3 inches wide, and 8.71 inches deep. It slips into my backpack and, even though I'm used to carrying the M3 MacBook Air, I mostly forget it's there.\nApple hasn't adjusted the ports since the M2 MacBook Pro, which is fine with me. We still have the HDMI-out port if you want to extend your display to a giant, high-resolution screen. Next to that is one of the three Thunderbolt 4 ports and an SD card slot, which I used to transfer some raw images from my DSLR. On the opposite side is the MagSafe charge port, two Thunderbolt 4 (40Gb/s) ports, and the 3.5mm headphone, although I generally connect my AirPods Pros 2 for audio. If you need Thunderbolt 5's 120Gb/s throughput speeds you'll want to upgrade to an M4 Pro chip.\nThe full-sized backlit Magic Keyboard is a pleasure to use (I'm composing this review on it), with ample travel and a satisfying typing feel. It includes the arrow keys and a full line of function keys. On the right side of that is the Touch ID power and sleep button. During setup, it took me a few moments to register my index finger which I now use to unlock the laptop and log into some online services. Below the keyboard is the massive, nearly 6-inch diagonal, and very responsive Forcetouch trackpad.\nOne of the benefits of a larger laptop is that Apple can fit a pair of speaker grilles on either side of the keyboard. They provide fantastic sound, especially when playing spatial audio (try Territory on Netflix).\nThe system features a pair of four-inch vents, one on each side. You usually won't hear the fan until you play AAA games or run benchmarks.\n- Design score: 5/5\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 (2024) review: Display\n- It's gorgeous\n- Better brightness for SDR\n- The coating you want\nWhile it might look like Apple left the Liquid Retina XDR display from the M2 MacBook Pro untouched, there are a couple of noteworthy differences. But let's start with what's the same.\nIt's still the same mini-LED technology offering a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio and one billion colors with a P3 wide color and ProMotion with up to 120Hz refresh rate. The resolution is still nearly 4K at 3096 x 1964 pixels. However, Apple has boosted the brightness a bit, with SDR content now getting up to 1,000 nits. HDR still gets a peak brightness of 1600. These numbers primarily matter outdoors, where you might be battling back the sunshine, and I found that the display was quite effective at remaining viewable and usable in direct sunlight. I attribute this, however, only in part to the heightened SDR nit capabilities.\nMy screen came with the optional nano-texture coating. This adds a fine texture across the entire screen that's meant to diffuse direct sunlight (the MacBook Pro comes with a special cloth for cleaning the screen). It costs an extra $150 / \u00a3150 / AU$230, but it's transformative technology. Not only does it effectively kill outdoor reflections, it also transforms how streaming and gaming content looks on the display. No more desk and overhead lamp bulbs peaking into the frame. No more window light killing your gaming groove. I honestly wonder why all laptops, Macs and otherwise, do not come with this texture. It's a game-changer.\nThe 14.2-inch screen is big enough for lots of side-by-side app work. It's the perfect canvas for photo editing in Adobe Lightroom and video work in FinalCut Pro. but is also well suited to lighter productivity (like my efforts to write this review), email, and web browsing. It's not a touch screen because Apple refuses to bring that technology to Macs, even as the touch-friendly iPad Pro becomes more and more Mac-like. The trackpad is large enough that I don't miss touching a screen (as I did for years for Microsoft Surface Pro) but I can't help but wonder how a MacBook Pro with a touch, and Apple Pencil-friendly, display would alter the way we use this laptop.\nThe other display change relates less to what you'll see on the Liquid Retina XDR panel and more to how others will see you through it. Apple has upgraded the FaceTime camera, which sits at the top of the display in a cutout notch, with a 12MP ultrawide that supports its Center Stage technology. Center Stage takes the full 12MP ultrawide frame and narrows the viewport so that you are always centered in the frame. It doesn't matter if you lean left or right or get up and walk around the room, Center Stage will follow. It's a useful feature in FaceTime \u2013 I tested it on a call with my wife who wondered why I kept moving around \u2013 and also on Zoom, where it worked well but was not useful in a broadcast video situation, so I turned it off. Center Stage did not work for me in Google Meet, where I conduct most of my video meetings.\n- Display score: 4.5/5\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 (2024) review: Performance\n- M4 has the Pro power most need\n- macOS Sequoia is flexible and easy to use\n- AAA gaming on a Mac is real\nHere\u2019s how the MacBook Pro 14-inch (2024) performed in our suite of TechRadar and Future Labs benchmark tests:\nCinebench R23 CPU: Single-Core: 2,180 Multi-Core: 13773\nGeekbench 6.3 Single-Core: 3,845; Multi-Core: 15,136\nGeekbench AI: Single: 4,764 Half Precision: 7,837 ; Quantized Score: 6.357\nPugentBench Photoshop: 10,542\nPugentBench Premier Pro: 4,618\nBlender: Monster: 115.8; Junkshop: 73.17; Classroom: 188.1\nBattery Life (web site surfing rundown): 18 hours and 31 minutes\nThe last time we reviewed a 14-inch MacBook Pro, it was running an M2 Pro. The base M4 inside my test unit has similar but not equal specs. It's still a 10-core CPU, but where the M2 Pro had a 16-core GPU, the M4 starts with 10 cores. However the M2 chips were all built on a 5-nanometer process, and the M4 line is on the more efficient three nanometers, which could lead to a better combination of power and efficiency.\nThe Neural Engine, which handles a lot of onboard machine learning and AI tasks, still has the same 16 cores.\nApple is now backing all of its new Macs with at least 16GB of RAM. This pays dividends in AI (Apple Intelligence is on board) and graphically intense operations like ray tracing, which helps make games like Lies of P look incredible on the MacBook Pro 14.\nIn benchmark testing, I found the numbers in line with the M4 performance I saw from the iPad Pro 13 inch. Geekbench 6.3 numbers measurably exceed those of the M3 in my MacBook Air.\nWhen I played Shadow of the Tomb Radar, Steam's internal frames per second counter showed I got anywhere between 42fps and 62fps. To my eyes, there was no tearing or dropped frames.\nNumbers only tell you so much, and what matters most is real-world experience. I did do a fair amount of gaming on this MacBook Pro. As I noted above, the nano-texture screen makes games look amazing. In my Lies of P sessions (I connected an X Box controller via Bluetooth), I took note of the rich atmospherics, from rain to fire, and the level of detail that never descended into unwatchable blurs. Gaming on the MacBook Pro benefits from macOS Sequoia's Game Mode, which prioritizes gaming tasks for truly smooth and responsive performance.\nIn FinalCut Pro, I edited four 4K 30fps streams at once, which played back smoothly in full-screen preview. However, when I tried the same thing with four 4K 120fps video clips shot on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, full-screen playback started dropping frames \u2013 an on-screen message confirmed this. It was one of the rare times I found the limits of Apple silicon.\nEditing raw photos in Adobe Lightroom is a breeze. It's also worth noting that I rarely shut down other apps while I performed these operations, and as I noted earlier, the only times I heard the fans were during console-grade gameplay and Cinebench 23 benchmarking.\nKeep in mind that my tests were all with the base M4 Apple silicon; imagine what you can expect from the M4 Pro and M4 Max.\nConnectivity is mostly what you would expect, with support for Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi 6E. I am a bit disappointed, though, that Apple didn't future-proof the laptop a bit with Wi-Fi 7 support.\n- Performance score: 5/5\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 (2024) review: Software\n- macOS 15.1\n- Some Apple Intelligence\nmacOS Sequoia (macOS 15.1) has a lot to offer. There's the new Passwords app, which gives you a full-blown application for managing your passwords, and there's the updated Notes, which can now transcribe recordings. It's not as good as the transcription in Voice Recorder on Android (it doesn't identify multiple speakers) but it's still useful.\nThere are now Highlights in Safari that can take a 3,000-word-plus New Yorker article and boil it down to a one-paragraph summary. I worry that loses the nuance of such a piece, but if you're in a hurry...\nThere's also iPhone Mirroring, which lets you access and control your iPhone from the MacBook Pro. It's supposed to be useful when you don't have access to your iPhone (maybe it's just in another room), and I found it easy to connect an iPhone 16 Pro and then have a virtual version of the iPhone on my MacBook Pro 14 desktop. What's even wilder is how I can control the phone from the desktop system. I can message, browse the web, and even drag and drop between the desktop and the iPhone interface. I did notice that while I can open the iPhone camera, I cannot use the MacBook Pro 14 to take a picture with the phone.\nApple Intelligence is here within macOS 15.1, in the form of a redesigned Siri that supports Type to Siri and which can be dragged around the desktop. I found that I could ask Siri how to do things with the MacBook Pro, like find my Wi-Fi settings and opening an app like Notes.\nApple Intelligence puts email summaries at the top of email, and the writing tools are embedded throughout the system. In Notes, I asked the Writing Tools to rewrite my lengthy meeting notes. It did a really good job of boiling it all down to a concise bullet list, which I could also easily undo. This could be very useful.\nThis is not all of Apple Intelligence. There's no Image Playground for instance, but that will show up with macOS 15.2, possibly by early December.\nA taste of AI\nDuring my testing, I did install the macOS 15.2 Developer Beta so that I could get a sample of this MacBook Pro 14 M4's Apple Intelligence capabilities. Because this update is not intended for the public, my thoughts on this dev beta were not considered as part of my final software, performance and overall review score.\nFirst, I was excited to see Clean Up now inside of the Photos app. It works just as it does in iOS 18 on the iPhone, and was useful for removing some unwanted items from my photos.\nChatGPT's Siri integration, which I had to enable, is quite smooth, and looks and works as if it's a part of Siri. I used it in the Type to Siri mode, entering my prompt about how to create a goods presentation. The answer I got from ChatGPT through Siri was solid.\nImage Playground, the generative AI image tool which lives in an adorable kitty app icon in the Dock, is also part of this beta, but it's still gated by an invite and, as I write this, I still await mine.\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 (2024) review: Battery life\n- Rated for 24-hour video streaming\n- Lasted more than 18 hours in our tests\n- Battery life is dependent on activity\nThe MacBook Pro 14 M4 is, according to Apple's promises, perhaps the first truly all-day laptop, rated to last up to 24 hours on a charge. Naturally, that's if you do nothing but stream seasons 1 through 3 of Stranger Things. Once you start adding in activities like web browsing, and emailing, Slack, gaming, and photo and video editing, those numbers change.\nIn our Future Labs tests, we found that we could get 18.5 hours of web browsing, which is two hours more than Apple is promising. Once I started gaming, though, battery life took a fast tumble; the system is clearly hard at work rendering the exquisite detail in Lies of P. I heard the fans going full-blast, and noticed the bottom of the laptop got quite warm. My advice is if you want to use the MacBook Pro 14 M4 as a gaming rig, keep the included 70W charger and woven USB-C to MagSafe cable close by.\nSpeaking of that charger; when I drained the system to zero, I was able to use it to recharge the MacBook Pro 14 M4 to 43% in 30 minutes. That's a bit less than the 50% I was expecting. To fully recharge, it took more than an hour.\nI've had incredible battery experiences with the MacBook Air and its M3 chip. I can already see that, in normal use, the MacBook Pro 14 M4 is a sun-up-to-sun-down kind of system. That's impressive, and a big win for Pro fans.\n- Battery score: 4.5 / 5\nShould you buy the Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 (2024)?\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Good price for more memory and a faster CPU | 4/5 |\nDesign | Virtually the same design as the previous model.

Try an iPad or a Surface Pro.\nYou have a 2024 MacBook Pro\nApple hasn't redesigned the MacBook Pro, and the M2 and M4 performance numbers are not that far apart.\nMacBook Pro 14-inch M4 (2024) review: Also consider\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | MacBook Pro M2 Pro 14-inch (2023) | MacBook Air (M3, 2024) | Dell XPS 13 Plus |\n|---|---|---|---|\nPrice: | $1,999 / \u00a32,149 / AU$3,199 | $1,099 / \u00a31,099 / AU$1,799 | $1,299 / \u00a31,399 / AU$2,339 |\nCPU: | Apple M2 Pro (10-core) | Apple M3 (8-core) | Intel Core i7-1280P (14-core) |\nGraphics: | Integrated 16-core GPU | Integrated 8-core GPU | Intel Iris Xe |\nRAM: | 16GB unified memory | 8GB unified memory | 16GB LPDDR5 |\nScreen: | 14.2-inch, 3024 x 1964 Liquid Retina XDR display (mini-LED, 1,000 nits sustained brightness, wide color P3 gamut, ProMotion technology) | 13.6-inch, 2,560 x 1,664 Liquid Retina display (backlit LED, IPS, 500 nits brightness, wide color P3 gamut) | 13.4-inch, 3,456 x 2,160, 60Hz, OLED, Touch, Anti-Reflect, 400 nit |\nStorage: | 512GB | 256GB | 512GB |\nPorts: | 3x Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C), HDMI, SDXC card slot, 3.5mm headphone jack, MagSafe 3 | 2x Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C), 3.5mm headphone jack, MagSafe 3 charging port | 2 x Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) |\nWireless: | Wi-Fi 6e (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.3 | Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3 | Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2 |\nCamera: | 1080p FaceTime HD webcam | 1080p FaceTime HD webcam | 720p, 30 FPS HD |\nWeight: | 3.5 lbs (1.6kg) | 2.7 pounds (1.24kg) | 2.77 pounds (1.26kg) |\nDimensions: | 12.31 x 8.71 x 0.61 inches (313 x 221 x 16mm) | 11.97 x 8.46 x 0.44 inches (30.41 x 21.5 x 1.13cm; W x D x H) | 11.63 x 7.84 x 0.60 inches (29.54 x 19.91 x 1.52 cm) |\nIf our Apple MacBook Pro 14 M4 (2024) review leaves you considering other options, here are two laptops to consider...\nApple MacBook Air (M3, 2022)\nThe follow-up to one of the best laptops ever released, the 2022 MacBook Air is svelte and sleek, with a larger screen and the same outstanding battery life.

Since joining TechRadar in 2014, he's reviewed over 250 laptops and computing accessories, many of which are Macs and MacBooks, as well as competitor devices from the likes of Microsoft, HP and Lenovo.\nThe best MacBooks and Macs 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nWe've tested every MacBook, iMac, and Mac mini under the sun to bring you the best of the best. Whether you're after a budget-buy entry to the world of Apple computing or you're upgrading to the latest hardware and want to know where the best bang for your buck is, you've landed on the right list. These are our picks for the best Macs you can buy.\nThe best MacBook overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the best ultraportable MacBook: On the outside, the latest 13-inch MacBook Air looks like previous models, but the M4 chip upgrade and lower price makes it a winner.\n\u2705 You're after a thin and light laptop: At 0.44 inches / 1.13cm thick and just 2.7lbs /1.24kg, the new 13-inch Air is perfect for traveling with.\n\u274c You want a touchscreen: Apple has been on record saying it won't make a touchscreen MacBook, so you might need to go for an iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard, or switch to Windows 11.\n\u274c You're excited about AI: While competitors like Microsoft and Google are storming ahead with adding AI to its products, Apple Intelligence has yet to properly take off.\nApple launched a brand-new MacBook Air in 2025, which is now powered by its latest and greatest chip, the M4, and it has once again produced not only the best MacBook you can buy right now, but also the best laptop in the world.\nOn the outside, it might seem like Apple has played it safe with the MacBook Air 13-inch (M4), as it keeps the same design as the previous two iterations. However, we're not complaining - this is one of the best-looking laptops around, and at just 2.7lbs / 1.24kg, and with dimensions of 11.97 x 8.46 x 0.44 inches / 30.41 x 21.5 x 1.13cm, I love how easy this - and previous MacBook Airs - is to place this in a backpack and easily carry it around whereever I go.\nThe backlit keyboard feels fantastic to type on, and the glass-covered multi-touch trackpad is comfortable to use, and makes working in macOS a pleasure. Screen-wise, the MacBook Air 13-inch (M4) comes with the same excellent 13.6-inch Liquid Retina panel with 2560 x 1664 resolution and 500 nits of sustained brightness as last year's model, though the once-controversial notch now contains the upgraded 12MP Center Stage Camera webcam, which we found makes video calls look even better, and allows for some cool effects, such as keeping you in frame as you move around the room (as long as you don't stray too far).\nHowever, inside the MacBook Air (M4), there's been some major changes, mainly thanks to Apple's latest chip. The M4 now supports up to 32GB of unified memory, with the base model of the MacBook Air (M4) starting at 16GB (previous models came with just 8GB), and we found it was particularly great at multi-tasking with multiple apps open at once (during our review we had Garage Band running for making music, while editing images and videos in Pixelmator Pro). We even played the AAA game Lies of Pi at maximum settings and it was smooth as butter, thanks no doubt in part to the new Game Mode in macOS that optimizes performance for gaming. Playing that game while also running Final Cut Pro to edit four 4K 30fps streams at once proved just how good the MacBook Air 13-inch (M4) is at keeping up with demanding tasks - which is especially impressive considering the new, lower, launch price of $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,699.\nRead our in-depth MacBook Air 13-inch (M4) review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | The MacBook Air 13-inch (M4) offers very good value for money with a new, lower, starting price | 4.5/5 |\nDesign | Still an excellent build and design, and the Sky Blue color is splendid. | 4.5/5 |\nDisplay and Center Stage | Beautiful Liquid Retina Display, and the Center Stage camera upgrade is a welcome one. | 4.5/5 |\nmacOS and Apple Intelligence | Excellent platform, but Apple Intelligence is not yet making it a must-buy | 4/5 |\nPerformance | The M4 raises the bar on performance to keep pace with and sometimes surpass the Qualcomm competition. | 4.5/5 |\nBattery life | 18 hours is possible if you only watch video, but an eight-hour day of hard work is still impressive | 5/5 |\nThe best budget MacBook\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an ultra-portable MacBook that's affordable: The MacBook Air M3 has had its price cut since the M4 model released, making this a brilliant thin and light laptop that isn't outrageously expensive and will cope with almost any task you throw at it.\n\u2705 You don't need extreme power: The MacBook Air 13-inch (M3) offers brilliant performance, so if you don't need a MacBook Pro for heavy creative tasks (and aren't bothered about the newer M4 chip), the Air is a great alternative.\n\u274c You want the latest hardware: The M3 chip in this MacBook Air remains a great performer, but it's not the most recent chip. The MacBook Air with the newer M4 chip is the one to get if you want cutting-edge Apple silicon.\n\u274c You want a big screen: The 13.6-inch screen makes the MacBook Air a great portable device, but some people may prefer the 15-inch model for working on.\nApple\u2019s previous MacBook Air model, which launched in 2024, comes with the M3 chip, bringing this nicely portable 13-inch laptop even closer to the level of performance you might expect from the MacBook Pro range. While the latter remains the choice for power users and content creators, the MacBook Air (M3) closes the gap more than ever, and now that the newer MacBook Air (M4) has been released, the price of the M3 model has dropped as retailers aim to clear stock.\nOne important thing to note is that Apple has stopped selling the MacBook Air (M3) itself, but other retailers such as Amazon and Walmart are continuing to sell it at a reduced price. When big shopping events like Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday come around, the MacBook Air (M3) could get further price cuts, making this by far the best budget MacBook you can buy.\nThe MacBook Air (M3) remains a top-notch performer for everyday computing, and impressive for more demanding tasks like content creation \u2013 or even dabbling in playing some games. While reviewing it, I found that it provides a great multi-tasking experience. I ran a variety of apps, including Safari, Garage Band, and Apple TV at once without any noticable slowdown, and thanks to its fanless design, the MacBook Air (M3) is almost completely silent when in use. I also ran more demanding software, such as Adobe Photoshop and Ableton Live 12, on the MacBook Air (M3) and, again, I was very impressed with how well this MacBook performed, with apps opening quickly and reliably.\nBoasting plenty of battery life \u2013 14 hours on a single charge in our tests \u2013 and a new lower price point, the M3-toting version of the MacBook Air pushes this device to fresh heights, and is an excellent buy overall.\nRead our in-depth MacBook Air (M3) review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | The MacBook Air 13-inch (M3) offers very good value for money with a new, lower, starting price | 4.5/5 |\nDesign | No new design, but if it's not broken, why fix it? | 4.5/5 |\nPerformance | The M3 chip proves to be an excellent, if not particularly revolutionary, upgrade over the M2 | 4.5/5 |\nBattery life | You'll easily get through a whole work day on a single charge | 5/5 |\nThe best Mac\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an affordable Mac: This is the cheapest way to get into the Mac ecosystem, and it's worth every cent thanks to excellent performance and a gorgeous design.\n\u2705 You're looking for a mini PC: Put simply, if you want a small form factor desktop PC, this is the one to get. No Windows 11 mini PC can come close.\n\u274c You want a gaming PC: There's a growing library of Mac-compatible games out there, but if you want to play AAA titles with graphical settings whacked up to max, a gaming PC (or gaming laptop) remains a better buy.\n\u274c You like to tinker and upgrade your PCs: Apple has never seemed keen on letting its users open up and upgrade their devices, but due to the compact size of the mac Mini (M4), it's even harder.\nIf you're on the hunt for a powerful Apple computer that will get the job done with that Mac flair but without breaking the bank, then you're after the Mac mini, especially now that it comes with an even smaller design, plus new and improved M4 hardware inside.\nApple also finally put the lowest RAM config at 16GB, which is more necessary than ever with memory-hungry apps like Chrome happily gobbling up resources.\nThe model I reviewed is the Mac mini with M4 chip, 16GB of unified memory, and a 512GB SSD. For day-to-day tasks, where I used the Mac mini for writing the review, browsing the web and general admin, it worked brilliantly. The operating system \u2013 macOS Sequoia \u2013 booted quickly, and every app I used loaded speedily and ran smoothly.\nI also used Premier Pro for editing videos in 4K, and the Mac mini didn't miss a beat - which is particularly impressive considering its tiny size (and low price point). I also played Shadow of the Tomb Raider on the Mac mini (M4), and at high graphics settings it hit a very good 44fps (frames per second). While I wouldn't say the Mac mini (M4) is a gaming PC, for dabbling in games it does an impressive job (and remains completely silent), and thanks to its lounge-friendly compact design, it could be the closest we come to getting an Apple games console.\nIn the downside department, you may not love the fact that there's no USB-A port - but you can always supplement with one of our picks for the best USB-C hubs.\nIt's smaller, it's faster, it's better. For an affordable foot in the Apple-ecosystem door, choose the Mac mini (M4) simply can't be beat.\nRead the in-depth Apple Mac mini (M4) review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | The new Mac mini once again offers phenomenal value for money | 5 / 5 |\nDesign | The new design is fantastic, with a smaller footprint and additional ports. Just a shame about the placement of the power button | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Simply amazing performance for a mini PC at this price, though it struggles with modern games a bit | 4.5 / 5 |\nThe Best MacBook for Content Creators\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a powerful yet portable workstation laptop: The MacBook Pro 14-inch comes with Apple's latest and most powerful M4 chips, offering brilliant performance in a compact laptop.\n\u2705 You want all-day battery: Despite its powerful components, the MacBook Pro 14-inch is very efficient and that means its battery can last almost all day - in our tests it hit 18 hours on a single charge.\n\u274c You want a touchscreen: Some creatives like the intuitiveness of a touchscreen for some tasks, and if that's you then I'm afraid you'll be disappointed with the 14-inch MacBook Pro, which, like other MacBooks, doesn't feature one.\n\u274c You have an M2 or M3 MacBook Pro: There's no denying that the new M4 chip is seriously powerful, but there's not a big enough gap between it and the two previous generations to justify buying a new MacBook.\nThe MacBook Pro line has earned a reputation as excellent laptops for creative work over the years, and there are very good reasons why. They always offer a sleek, well-built machine with capable hardware and the Apple touch that just can't be replicated.\nSo when Apple unveiled the latest MacBook Pro, you already know we had to put it through its paces and see if the lineup is still worthy of its presumed prowess.\nIt is.\nPerhaps the most important aspect of the MacBook pro for creatives, the display, is an absolute homerun. Its 14-inch, 120Hz, mini-LED screen is the perfect canvas for graphic design and media enjoyment, and the Apple M4 silicone packed under the MacBook's hood is a match made in heaven.\nAnd good news if you enjoy the pastime: the M4 MacBook Pro can even handle AAA games. I know - gaming on a Mac? The M4 chip says \"yes.\" Our tests found an average of 42-62fps in Lies of P.\nOf course, we didn't just play games while testing the MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4) - we put it through its paces in FinalCut Pro, editing four 4K 30fps streams at once, where playback was extremely smooth. However, footage from an iPhone 16 Pro Max recorded at 4K and 120fps did stress the base M4 chip when we tried editing four streams at once. If you're going to be doing that kind of intensive creative work, then I recommend going for the MacBook Pro 14-inch model with either the M4 Pro or M4 Max chips.\nIt's got the design, the display, and the performance - the only kicker here is the price (the other thing MacBooks are known for). It's expensive, but you definitely get what you pay for.\nRead our in-depth Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4) review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Good price for more memory and a faster CPU | 4/5 |\nDesign | Virtually the same design as the previous model.

No other all-in-one PC comes close.\n\u2705 You want a sleek, yet colorful, desktop computer: The iMac (M4) is incredibly thin, while still offering excellent performance. It will look good on pretty much any desk, and there's some great new color choices as well.\n\u274c You the most powerful Mac: The latest iMac only comes with the M4 chip, which is undoubtedly powerful, but doesn't reach the performance highs of the M4 Pro and M4 Max found in some of the best MacBooks and Macs.\n\u274c You want a big screen: The iMac also only comes in one screen size: 24 inches. Some people might find this a bit too cramped, but with no sign of a larger iMac on the horizon, you'll need to look elsewhere for something with a big screen.\nApple's latest iMac brings a host of new color options, the updated M4 processor, double the base RAM configuration of the M3 iMac, and a lower price tag to boot. There's some serious value here, and we wouldn't blame you if you hadn't noticed it at first because the beautiful new colorways grabbed your eye first.\nOur review unit came in purple and looked absolutely stunning, but you can also choose from blue, pink, yellow, orange, green, and the classic Apple silver.\nIt's not just a pretty face, though; it's got some serious computing power to show off. We scrutinized the M4 iMac's performance for any slow-downs or stutters throughout a range of tests including photo and video editing, gaming, and AI/ML tasks; we couldn't get the M4 chip to fold in everyday scenarios. We ran both Safari and Google Chrome web browsers with upwards of 20 tabs, as well as Slack, Messages, Pixelmator, Preview, Calendar, a couple more apps, and iPhone Mirroring open, and the iMac didn't crash or hang. While more intensive tasks will require a Mac or MacBook with a more powerful M4 Pro or M4 Max chip, for most users, the iMac (M4) will offer more than enough power.\nWhen you consider its design and performance, and with 16GB of RAM finally set as the entry-point, a set of new USB-C Apple Magic peripherals included, and a lower price tag on top of it all, the M4 iMac is easily the best all-in-one PC you can buy.\nRead our in-depth Apple iMac 24-inch (M4) review\nValue | A lower starting price year over year makes the iMac a lot more affordable without undercutting the performance | 4.5/5 | Row 0 - Cell 3 |\nDesign | New colors freshen up a modern design that won't take up much space on your desk | 4.5/5 | Row 1 - Cell 3 |\nDisplay | It's a one-size-fits-all solution, but the 24-inch Retina display is visually immersive for myriad tasks. | 4/5 | Row 2 - Cell 3 |\nPerformance | Apple's M4 chip provides ample power, now and well into the future | 4.5/5 | Row 3 - Cell 3 |\nThe best 15-inch MacBook\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a 15-inch laptop: Apple has done it again, and the latest MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) is the best 15-inch laptop you can buy, and for most people, it's the best big-screen MacBook to get.\n\u2705 You have an Intel-based MacBook: If you have an old Intel-based MacBook, then the new M4 MacBook Air will offer a very noticable upgrade.\n\u274c You have an M2 or M3 MacBook: While the M4 chip is a great performer, I still don't think you'll need to upgrade if you have an M2 or M3 MacBook, as the leap isn't quite worth it.\n\u274c You want the most powerful MacBook: While I think that the MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) is the best large-screen MacBook for most general users, mainly thanks to its slim design and affordable price, if you want a MacBook for demanding tasks like 3D modelling, go for the MacBook Pro 16-inch with M4 Pro or M4 Max instead.\nIf you want a large screen MacBook, then unless you're a creative professional that needs huge amounts of power, I strongly recommend the MacBook Air 15-inch, which for 2025 has been upgraded with the very latest M4 chip.\nI was really impressed when personally reviewing the MacBook Air 15-inch (M4), with the MacBook offering excellent performance, a large and vibrant screen, and a lovely thin and light design that means even with the extra screen space, this is still a laptop you can easily carry around with you.\nI have a bad habit of browsing the web with loads of tabs open in Chrome, but that didn't phase the MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) at all, and with the added memory that comes with the base model (16GB rather than 8GB of previous generations), this is an excellent multi-tasker. I had Premiere Pro running to edit videos while also watching a TV show in the Apple TV app, and the 15-inch MacBook Air kept everything running smoothly - and silently, thanks to the fanless design.\nI should also give a big shoutout to the built-in speakers of the MacBook Air (which are an improvement over the ones found in the smaller 13-inch MacBook Air, which otherwise features a very similar list of specs and features) - the sound they produce is loud, detailed and immersive - especially impressive considering how thin this MacBook is.\nPerhaps best of all, and the reason why I'd recommend the MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) over the MacBook Pro for most people, is that its launch price of $1,199 / \u00a31,199 / AU$2,099, which gives you an M4 chip with a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB of unified memory and 256GB of SSD storage, is $100 / \u00a3200 / AU$100 less than the previous M3 model launched at, making this large-screen MacBook even better value for money.\nRead our full Apple MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | Now with a new, lower price, the MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) offers excellent value for money. | 4.5 / 5 |\nDesign | The design remains the same, but that's not a bad thing - this is a stylish thin and light 15-inch laptop. However, competitors are beginning to catch up. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | The MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) is a solid performer that can handle any day to day task you throw at it. It's not a major leap from the M3 model, however. | 4 / 5 |\nAverage rating | The MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) is the best 15-inch laptop you can buy, especially due to its new lower price, which makes it better value than ever. | 4.5 / 5 |\nThe Best Mac for pure performance\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an extremely powerful and compact workstation: The small size combined with the incredible amount of power the M3 Ultra chip provides means the new Mac Studio really doesn\u2019t have any competition.\n\u2705 You need professional-grade graphics power: The new Mac Studio, especially with the M3 Ultra chip, offers a level of performance that will seriously please demanding power users, particularly when it comes to graphics work.\n\u274c You don\u2019t need pro-grade performance: Even the 'entry level' Mac Studio, with the M4 Max chip, offers a huge amount of power that most people won't need. This is a professional workstation with a spec sheet and price tag to match.\n\u274c You are on a budget: The latest Mac Studio comes with some of the most powerful hardware you can buy for creative tasks, while also coming in a stylish and compact case - and this means this is a very expensive product. If you don't need the power, consider the much cheaper Mac mini instead.\nThe Mac Studio is like a supercharged Mac mini for creative professionals. It's an impressively compact computer that comes packing some serious power in its latest incarnation, thanks to a choice of the M4 Max or M3 Ultra chips. Unlike previous models of the Mac Studio, which kept to single generations of Apple's M-series chips, the latest Mac Studio's base model comes with the very latest M4 Max chip. However, if you want even more power, you can get it with the M3 Ultra.\nWhile the M3 chip is a previous generation, the M3 Ultra is made up of two M3 Max chips connected together, which means it blows past the M4 Max when it comes to intensive workloads.\nThe Mac Studio is a formidable machine when it comes to video editing, coding and 3D modeling. It certainly easily handled any task I threw at it while reviewing the Mac Studio - web browsing with Safari and Chrome, with multiple tabs open was no issue at all, and even the most complex projects that I opened in Adobe Premiere Pro (with footage shot at 4K and above) were incredibly smooth.\nThe super-fast SSD meant that video files were loaded and complex projects saved in seconds (using the Blackmagic Disk Speed Test app, the SSD hit write speeds of 7,115.6 and read speeds of 5,799MB/s).\nEven when I was working with large 4K video files and multi-scene projects (while browsing the web and writing up the review at the same time), the Mac Studio didn't miss a beat.\nThe level of performance available here will be overkill for many people, but if you're looking for a workstation PC for heavy creative workloads, such as editing 8K footage or rendering complex 3D scenes and animations, then the Mac Studio will be a great choice. It's expensive, but worth the investment.\nRead my in-depth Mac Studio (M3 Ultra) review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | There's no getting away from the fact that the Mac Studio is an expensive bit of kit which will be out of reach for many people, but for the money you do get an incredible workstation. | 3.5 / 5 |\nDesign | The Mac Studio's stylish and compact design really has no rivals. It's something of an engineering marvel considering the powerful components inside, though the lack of upgradability and older wireless tech are a shame. | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | The new Mac Studio, especially equipped with the M3 Ultra chip, offers an incredible level of performance. | 5 / 5 |\nAverage rating | While the Mac Studio won't be for everyone, if it is for you, then you're not going to find another workstation of this calibre. | 4.5 / 5 |\nHow to choose the best Mac and MacBooks for you\nWhat to look for in the best Macs and MacBooks\nWhether it\u2019s the heavyweight 16-inch MacBook Pro or the dinky little Mac mini, it\u2019s not hard to see why the best Macs and MacBooks are the weapons of choice of creative professionals. But thanks to a wide range of different Macs and MacBooks on offer, you don\u2019t need to be a creative professional to use an Apple laptop or PC \u2013 and there\u2019s a good chance that no matter what your needs are, there will be a Mac or MacBook for you.\nBut, with all this choice, it can be tricky to find the best Mac or MacBook for your particular needs. To help, I\u2019ve listed some of the most important things I consider when deciding whether or not to include a product in this buying guide, and this criteria can also help you when picking a new Mac or MacBook to buy.\nPerformance: Since 2020, and the unveiling of the M1 chip, Apple has been making its own Arm-based silicon to power modern Macs and MacBooks, rather than relying on Intel.\nIf that all sounds a bit jargony and complex, fear not, as the move has simplified things in some ways. The M1 was the first generation of Apple\u2019s own chips, followed by the M2, then M3 and finally the M4, which is the latest chip.\nThis gives you an idea of how recent a Mac is, and each new generation brings efficiency and performance improvements. The speed of these generational releases (four in the past five years) does mean that people with, say, an M2-powered Mac shouldn\u2019t really feel the need to upgrade to an M4 model, as the performance difference isn\u2019t quite big enough to justify buying a whole new Mac or MacBook.\nIt also means that with each new generation, previous generations often see price cuts, so if you\u2019re on a tight budget, buying an M2 or M3 Mac could be a better choice than buying an M4 model.\nThere are also more powerful variants of these chips which come in Pro and Max configurations. These offer much higher performance and are only found in MacBook Pro laptops, Mac Studio and the higher-end Mac mini, as these are Macs aimed at people (mainly professionals) who need additional performance. Meanwhile, the MacBook Air and iMac are aimed at more casual customers, so the more affordable base M chips are used.\nAnother thing to consider when weighing up how powerful a Mac is, is the amount of memory it comes with. Apple\u2019s modern Macs use unified memory, and this means the memory is shared across the hardware \u2013 so instead of having separate system RAM and video memory (VRAM), the memory is pooled and used depending on the tasks you\u2019re running.\nUp until recently, Apple\u2019s starting configurations for its base models of Macs came with 8GB of unified memory. However, with ever-more intensive apps being released, that amount of memory was increasingly being seen as too little. Thankfully, Apple got the message, and now new Macs and MacBooks come with 16GB by default.\nThe more unified memory a Mac or MacBook has, the better it is at multitasking (having multiple apps open at once, for instance), and these days 16GB should be the minimum. For future-proofing, going up to 24GB or 32GB will give you even better performance. If you want to also use the Mac for graphically-intensive tasks, then consider 64GB or higher considering that the memory will be shared across the hardware.\nEfficiency and battery life: Apple\u2019s M-series of chips aren\u2019t just great performers, they are also excellent at power efficiency, mainly thanks to their Arm architecture and the combination of performance cores (used when running intensive tasks) and efficiency cores (for when you\u2019re doing less intensive work, such as browsing the web). The M-series chips can intelligently switch between the two types of cores depending on what you\u2019re doing.\nThis means that the components don\u2019t use too much power, and that can result in extremely impressive battery lives for MacBooks, with most modern Apple laptops reaching 20 hours on a single charge.\nThis power efficiency also means less heat is produced when the components are running, and that has allowed Apple to produce impressively slim and compact devices, especially with the Mac mini, MacBook Air and iMac.\nIn some cases, such as the MacBook Air 13-inch (M4) and MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) this efficiency has meant Apple has been able to ditch internal fans as well. These fanless laptops are completely silent when in use.\nDisplay and design: MacBooks, especially MacBook Pros, come with some of the best screens you can find in a laptop. Thanks to a combination of high resolutions and wide color support, even the entry-level MacBooks look fantastic.\nThe more expensive models will often also boast adaptive refresh rates, known as ProMotion, which can make tasks, especially scrolling through websites and documents, as well as playing games, feel much smoother, while also helping to prolong battery life. The MacBook Pro range also have XDR (Extreme Dynamic Range) technology, which offer a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, leading to incredibly bright and vibrant image quality with extremely dark blacks.\nUnlike other Macs, the iMac comes with a built-in screen, and while it lacks some of the visual bells and whistles that the (much more expensive) MacBook Pros come with, you still get a great-looking 23.5-inch screen with a 4.5K Retina resolution and support for the Wide color (P3) gamut, which means colors are reproduced accurately, making it ideal for photographers and film makers.\nFor Macs without a display, I concentrate on the overall design of the PCs, along with the ports that allow you to connect them to a monitor or TV. Thanks to the compact designs of the Mac mini and Mac Studio, these can easily be hooked up to a screen, and even placed out of sight behind the screen for an extremely clean-looking setup.\nValue for money: Last, but definitely not least, I always consider the value proposition of a Mac or MacBook when deciding if it should go into this best Mac and MacBook list, and this should also be a very important consideration when you\u2019re looking to buy.\nWhen I talk about value for money, that doesn\u2019t just mean seeing if it\u2019s the cheapest product. After all, Apple isn\u2019t known for making budget devices. Instead, I consider how much it charges for its products compared to rival products that offer similar performance, design and features.\nSo, while the Mac mini and MacBook Air aren\u2019t the cheapest PC or laptop you can buy, they offer fantastic value for money as they offer experiences that rival products simply cannot compete with. In some cases, such as with the latest MacBook Air 13-inch (M4), Apple has even reduced the launch price compared to the previous model.\nEven with super-expensive Macs and MacBooks, such as the 16-inch MacBook Pro, their value should also be considered. If you need a powerful device to work on, investing in a high-end MacBook Pro, or even a Mac Studio, could end up providing excellent value for money despite their high price tags, especially if it enables you to finish projects more quickly, or means you don\u2019t need to upgrade the device for many, many years.\nOn the other hand, buying one of these devices when you don\u2019t need the level of performance they offer means they can be poor value, no matter how good they are.\nHow we test the best MacBooks and Macs\nTesting the best MacBooks and Macs is more intensive than you might think, especially because most of these devices are meant to be used by creative professionals with more taxing workloads.\nAside from putting any given Mac\u2019s build, display (if it has one), keyboard, trackpad, and webcam through their paces, we also perform creative benchmark tests like Handbrake, as well as run demanding workflows like editing an 8K video in Final Cut Pro and doing real-time 3D modeling and animation to see how every device fares in real-world situations. We also test battery life and take a look at heat management performance when running such intensive tasks.\nFAQs\nAre MacBooks touchscreen?\nNo. Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs was famously dismissive of the idea of touchscreen laptops, and current CEO Tim Cook seems to agree, as there's no sign that we'll get a touchscreen MacBook anytime soon. If you're after a 2-in-1 laptop, then you'll need to look at a Windows 11 laptop instead.\nIf you're determined to stick with Apple, then the closest you're going to get to a touchscreen MacBook is an iPad Pro with iPad Magic Keyboard.\nDo Macs need antivirus?\nFor decades, the recieved wisdom was that Macs didn't need antivirus software, as due to the vast popularity of Windows PCs compared to Macs running macOS, virus makers would target Windows due to the much larger amount of potential victims.\nWhile Windows 11 laptops and PCs still dominate, Macs and MacBooks have increased in popularity, and sadly that also means that viruses and malware targeting Mac users has also surged.\nHowever, for most users, you likely won't need an antivirus for your Mac, as long as you are careful. That means not opening emails, links or files from people or companies you don't know and being careful about what applications you download from the internet. As a general rule, downloading apps from Apple's own App Store for Macs will ensure that the downloads are virus-free, as Apple is careful to approve every app.\nThe Mac operating system, macOS, also has some good built-in security features which prevent downloaded apps from installing automatically without you knowing. However, if you want extra protection, or you use your Mac for essential work, then it's worth looking into the best Mac antivirus software for peace of mind.\nDo Macs have USB or HDMI ports?\nIt depends on the Mac you buy. Both the Mac mini and Mac Studio come with HDMI. Both the Mac Studio and Mac mini (M4) have HDMI 2.1 and support one display with up to 8K resolution at 60Hz, or 4K resolution at 240Hz.\nWhen it comes to MacBooks, both the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros come with a HDMI 2.1 port as well.\nMeanwhile, because the iMac has a built-in screen, and is aimed at more casual users, it does not come with an HDMI port. Neither do either size of MacBook Air. Instead, they use USB-C to connect to external screens. If the Mac or MacBook comes with Thunderbolt 4 USB ports you can connect one display with up 60Hz over DisplayPort 1.4.\nIf your Mac or MacBook comes with Thunderbolt 5 USB ports, you can use DisplayPort 2.1 and output to up to three external displays: two with 6K resolution and 60Hz refresh rate, plus one running at up to 8K at 60Hz.\nThe Mac mini, Mac Studio and MacBook Pros also have USB-C as well as HDMI ports, and those can also be used with external screen alongside HDMI and, in the case of the MacBook Pros, the built-in screen.\n- Want more choices?
