  "title": "A Democratic Socialist Mayor Mamdani would unleash destruction on NYC families",
  "description": "We learn the lesson as children that we are the company we keep \u2014 and this holds true for politicians seeking power over us. The allies they choose tell us what they find tolerable, and the more he\u2026",
  "content": "We learn the lesson as children that we are the company we keep \u2014 and this holds true for politicians seeking power over us.\n\nThe allies they choose tell us what they find tolerable, and the more heinous the compan, the more we should be on guard about what changes are coming our way.\n\nMayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani rose to national prominence after winning the Democratic primary this year, but he\u2019s been a Democratic Socialists of America member since 2017. The company he keeps is an organization that explicitly supports communist social and political frameworks \u2014 including eradicating the family.\n\nDSA speakers proudly denounced the nuclear family and pushed their long-term goal to destroy the desire for one in Chicago at their summer Socialism 2025 conference panel \u201cThe Left and The Family: A Roundtable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition to the abolition of family policing\u201d \u2014 government-run child-protective services \u2014 \u201cwe argue for the abolition of the family in general and say that the institution of the family acts as part of the carceral system in that it reinforces children as property,\u201d lamented Olivia Katbi, co-chair of DSA Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about family abolition . . . we\u2019re talking about the abolition of the economic unit,\u201d claimed University of Chicago sociologist Eman Abdelhadi. \u201cIt is a horizon . . . in which all of our material needs are taken care of by the collective.\u201d\n\nPanelist Emily Janakiram reduced matrimony to a wholly transactional process. \u201cThe only real difference between marriage and prostitution is the price and the duration of the contract,\u201d the Brooklyn writer declared.\n\nThat\u2019s an ironic attempt to insult marriage since communists love prostitution and do everything possible to enable its existence \u2014 see Zohran\u2019s ambition to decriminalize it, which he just confirmed.\n\nAmericans intrinsically know the destruction that comes from pulling a child from even one of his or her parents because we\u2019ve witnessed generations of children grow up struggling to rise from the rubble of their childhood.\n\nThese children, left behind to fend for themselves emotionally or physically, often become the adults we see traveling down a path of internal torment to complete ambivalence to unleashing their revenge against a society they believe ignored them.\n\nWhen communists like Katbi frame our most desired and natural child-rearing environment \u2014 with our biological parents \u2014 as a prison system, they\u2019re insidiously advocating for more children like me to suffer.\n\nI know firsthand what it\u2019s like to have a selfish parent choose themselves over their responsibility. If I had been given one wish as a child, I would have chosen to know what it\u2019s like to have a loving and involved father in my life.\n\nMy granted wish wouldn\u2019t have caused imprisonment, as these communists claim, but instead freedom from my insecurity and questioning whether I even deserve love stemming from abandonment.\n\nOnly a privileged ideologue would shout for the overthrow of the family unit; they wouldn\u2019t have to experience the consequences.\n\nAs Eman Abdelhadi explained on the panel, revolutionaries like her have their eyes on the long-term goal of abolishing the family structure \u2014 but to get to that point, they have to do things perceived as liberal, like offer universal child care.\n\nZohran portrays himself as someone who cares about the welfare of working-class families by promoting universal child care, but it\u2019s a ploy to make Americans comfortable with the smiling face of a communist thief.\n\nThese ambitions are the first step in radicals\u2019 fantasy of a communist revolution \u2014 not the last. They want to abolish the family structure because it hinders their control over the minds of the youth.\n\nWhile universal child care sounds good on its face, the question should be: Who is caring for these children, and what are they teaching them during those hours? If you\u2019re going to alter the future, you have to capture the minds of the young, who know no better.\n\nThe healthy family unit is the best deterrent against our children being used as pawns for a revolutionary cause.\n\nIn the DSA\u2019s distorted view, the family-court system would be a politicized arm that flexes its ideological muscle over parental figures who actively fight against the communist cause.\n\nIt\u2019s why they\u2019re desperate to reform \u201cfamily policing\u201d as it would allow them to dictate our children\u2019s circumstances and punish parents who interrupt the revolution.\n\nIf Zohran supports families, why would he proudly stay attached to an organization that inherently despises what most Americans enjoy and know works for our children\u2019s benefit?\n\nThe DSA sees him as a youthful prototype in line with what it believes, not against it \u2014 which is why Zohran hasn\u2019t challenged the ideas his DSA cohorts spew.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s not what Zohran says but what he doesn\u2019t say that should make every New York City resident wary.\n\nMy mother was right: You are the company you keep, and Zohran is the anti-family communist he proudly associates with.\n\nAdam B.

  "summary": "The article discusses the potential for a Democratic Socialist Mayor in New York, highlighting the hypocrisy of Zohran Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). The group's speakers denounced the nuclear family and advocated for the abolition of family policing, arguing that it reinforces children as property. University of Chicago sociologist Eman Abdelhadi suggested that the family is an economic unit that takes care of all of our material needs. Panelist Emily Janakiram compared matrimony to marriage, an attempt to insult marriage. The author argues that while Zohrans supports universal child care, this is a ploy to make Americans comfortable with the image of a communist thief. The article concludes that while the DSA\u2019s distorted view of the family-court system would be a political arm that flexes its ideological muscle over parental figures who actively fight against the communist cause, it would allow it to allow for greater freedom for children.",

I think a lot of them are emboldened.\u201d\nSmith also said the DSA\u2019s anti-family message at the conference runs counter to Mamdani\u2019s lavish lifestyle.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a nepo baby from a traditional family \u2014 but then he wants to distribute the wealth while also just having a luxury wedding,\u201d said Smith, who shared video of the seminar on X. \u201cIt\u2019s just another example of him being a massive hypocrite.\nMamdani\u2019s campaign did not return messages.\nCouncilman Robert Holden, a moderate Queens Democrat, said the panelists\u2019 remarks should serve as a warning to all NYC residents of the threat Mamdani poses to traditional American values.\n\u201cZohran Mamdani and his allies in the DSA are openly laying out their radical \u2018Project DSA 2026\u2019 agenda for state-run families, indoctrinating our children, and dismantling the very fabric of our society,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is exactly why we must defeat Mamdani and ensure he never gets anywhere near Gracie Mansion or City Hall.\u201d"

      "text": "Zohran Mamdani doubles down on pro-prostitution policies as he praises ex-NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s decriminalization focus\nMayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani has doubled down on his pro-prostitution policies.\nAfter being hounded by rival campaigns about his stance on decriminalizing sex work as a Queens assemblymember, Mamdani said Wednesday that he wants to mirror the policies of his favorite ex-mayor: Bill de Blasio.\n\u201cWhat I want to do is look at the ways in which the previous administration addressed this issue,\u201d Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, said when pressed on the issue during an unrelated public event on the Upper East Side.\n\u201cI found that it created far more safety than what the current administration has done,\u201d he told reporters, in a ding at Mayor Eric Adams, who is running for re-election as an independent in November.\nDe Blasio, at the tail end of his administration in 2020, proposed a series of reforms to decriminalize prostitution in an attempt to shift focus on the arrests of traffickers, rather than sex workers.\nOpponents of decriminalizing sex work, such as the National Organization of Women, however, argue it could actually lead to spikes in sex trafficking, as well as a decrease in quality of life for New Yorkers due to open-air brothels.\nDe Blasio\u2019s admin pushed the use of \u201ccommunity-centered services\u201d for sex workers, rather than arrests, and services supporting victims of trafficking.\nBut it\u2019s not clear how much of these policies ended up being implemented.\nCurrent City Hall representatives didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about the Adams admin\u2019s implementation or rollback of the de-Blasio era proposals.\nBut Mamdani, a proud Democratic Socialists of America member, took the opportunity to swipe at Adams\u2019 record on the issue.\n\u201cSo I have said time and again, my focus is on the outcomes of public safety,\u201d he claimed.\n\u201cAnd what we have seen from this current administration is a theater, one that repeats itself every so often and leaves New Yorkers facing the same problems that they did a year prior.\u201d\nA representative for Adams\u2019 campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe Manhattan District attorney\u2019s Office announced that it would no longer prosecute prostitution cases in April 2021."

      "text": "Blame Canada: How Trump can help us from being smoked out of our summer\nDETROIT \u2014 Smokey Bear famously said, \u201cOnly you can prevent forest fires.\u201d\nBut because Canada has not put in an ounce of prevention \u2014 the smoke from its wildfires has invaded Michigan and other American skies for three straight summers \u2014 it will take a pound of cure to Make Michigan Summer Again.\nSo it falls on the best dealmaker the White House has ever seen to make our northern neighbor an offer it can\u2019t refuse: Either Canada puts out the wildfires ASAP. Or the US military will, perhaps en route to Canada\u2019s annexation as the 51st state.\nSince the time of James Monroe, America has been jealous of the events within its hemisphere.\nUsually any problems emanate from parts south, whether it\u2019s fentanyl in Mexico or nuclear weapons in Cuba \u2014 not Canada.\nAny one summer of smoke can be understood, even excused. Things happen.\nPerhaps the second was a coincidence.\nBut the third, as Ian Fleming would say, feels like enemy action. In just three years, America\u2019s friend to the north has become a bad neighbor.\nThe Canadian Wildfire Information System shows moderate-to-high threats of fire danger in Ottawa, north of Michigan. In eastern Canada, above New England, the threats range from high to extreme.\nEsri Canada\u2019s map of active wildfires shows a problem from sea to smoke-covered sea.\nBBC calls 2025 Canada\u2019s second-worst wildfire season on record.\nConservative member of Canadian Parliament Michelle Rempel Garner has joined the blame game, declaring an \u201cutter lack of action from the federal government\u201d created the problem.\nSmoky summers were not a fixture of my childhood and cannot become a new normal for Michigan\u2019s children.\nNobody in Lansing has any answers.\nI asked a friend at Michigan\u2019s environmental department what was being done about the wildfire smoke.\nI was told it had issued air-quality alerts. That\u2019s not exactly the proactive response we\u2019re looking for.\n\u201cIn recent years, Michigan has seen unprecedented levels of wildfire smoke drifting across its communities and much of the rest of the country,\u201d reads the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy website.\n\u201cIn addition to pollutants like fine particulate matter carried in the smoke, there are gasses containing the chemicals that \u2014 when combined with sunlight \u2014 form ground-level ozone. These chemical reactions contribute to elevated ozone levels seen in areas across Michigan.\u201d\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer has thoughts on everything from tariffs to the impact of the Big Beautiful Bill to the price of back-to-school gear.\nBut she\u2019s been oddly silent on the smoke that falls on the Traverse City Democrat and the Midland-area Republican alike.\nWhitmer spent one-fourth of last year traveling abroad, and she is keeping a similar pace in 2025, according to her public calendar. Perhaps too many of her travels this year are to foreign lands and too few within Michigan, to take up the plight of the pleasant peninsulas.\nWhitmer met with President Trump this month at the White House. She apparently left her folder at home this time rather than hiding behind it.\nReports say Whitmer spoke about the $50 million in disaster relief Trump already granted for a northern Michigan ice storm \u2014 from months ago.\nThere is no evidence Whitmer spoke a word about the current problem.\nThe Michigan and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources have sent waves of firefighters to Canada, but it\u2019s not enough.\nWhitmer doesn\u2019t want the smoke with Canada. And why would she? She\u2019s just a governor. She\u2019s not looking for an international incident, especially when playing on the perception that Trump and Canada are at odds due to tariffs.\nMichigan Republicans haven\u2019t done much better. Rep. John James, who\u2019s running in the 2026 governor\u2019s race to replace Whitmer, sent Canada a strongly worded letter. Then he got the other six Republicans in Michigan\u2019s congressional delegation to join him in a second letter.\nBut Canada is the wrong target. James doesn\u2019t need to send a letter up north. He needs to call his friend the president.\nTrump has an affinity for Michigan and finished all three presidential campaigns there.\nIt would break the man\u2019s heart to know we are being smoked out of our summer.\nCanada can\u2019t be trusted to put out the wildfires.\nThe provinces Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have banned camping and hiking rather than fight fire with water.\nCanada has taken an active disinterest in managing its problem.\nAnd now its problem has become our problem.\nWhen Trump gets involved, there won\u2019t be a problem.\nThe wildfire smoke Canada treats as a gateway to authoritarian rule, offering another chance to order people to \u201cstay home and stay safe,\u201d is a threat to our lives and livelihoods in Michigan.\nThis aggression cannot stand.\nPresident Trump, it\u2019s time to make Canada an offer it can\u2019t refuse.\nJames David Dickson is a podcaster and independent journalist in Michigan."

Meyer,\u201d out Aug. 19.\nPredictably, the British government sought to deport Meyer (and, predictably, Miss MacDonald volunteered to intervene).\nThe same rizz that placed the prime minister\u2019s daughter in his arms brought a phalanx of famous Brits to his defense.\nClement Attlee, future prime minister, pleaded his case in Parliament.\nA petition signed by philosopher Bertrand Russell, \u201cHowards End\u201d and \u201cA Passage to India\u201d author E.M. Forster and Labour Party leader (and Angela Lansbury\u2019s grandfather) George Lansbury called the deportation \u201cdiscrimination\u201d prompted by the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre\u2019s \u201cleft-wing politics.\u201d\nStudents marched about London chanting, \u201cFree Frank Meyer!\u201d\nWomen desired his romantic attention. Rizz meant men wanted his company, too.\nIn 1930, an unknown Pottstown, Penn., prep-school teacher plaintively petitioned Meyer for more \u201cscintillating conversations\u201d and \u201cprovocative\u201d letters.\nHe wished to again drink with Meyer and \u201cto take a Cook\u2019s Tour of this particular part of the world with you.\u201d Without Meyer\u2019s company, he confessed, he inhabited an \u201cintellectual desert.\u201d\nThe sycophantic missive came from the typewriter of James A. Michener long before he won a Pulitzer Prize for \u201cTales of the South Pacific.\u201d\nBy 1949, when Meyer testified against former comrades in the Foley Square trial \u2014 the longest, most expensive court case in US history to that point \u2014 he had witnessed much evil.\nHe knew that Prince Mirsky, the force who pushed him to join the Communist Party, had disappeared in a Soviet gulag; his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Charles Darwin\u2019s great-grandson John Cornford, had died fighting in the Spanish Civil War; his boss on \u201cpeace\u201d activism, Walter Ulbricht (who later built the Berlin Wall), went about making the lives of East Germans hell; and his American idol, longtime party chief Earl Browder, had transformed overnight in Communist rhetoric from a brilliant, courageous leader into a perfidious enemy of the people.\nSlowly, he embraced a very different outlook. Quickly, and characteristically, the conservative convert became conservative pope.\nPresent at the creation of National Review, the Conservative Party of New York, the Philadelphia Society, the American Conservative Union and Young Americans for Freedom, Meyer helped erect the skeletal structure of the conservative movement.\nGoing to Woodstock meant something very different for 1960s young conservatives. Those making the obligatory pilgrimage to his farmhouse there included Joan Didion, who credited him as the editor who first published her freelance work, Garry Wills, who said he spent more time with this mentor in the late 1950s and early 1960s than anyone outside his family, and Heritage Foundation founder Ed Feulner.\nHis philosophy, fusionism, became the default outlook of the American right from Barry Goldwater well through Ronald Reagan, who cheered that Meyer had \u201cfashioned a vigorous new synthesis of traditional and libertarian thought \u2014 a synthesis that is today recognized by many as modern conservatism.\u201d\nWhat made conservatives so easily follow a former Communist? Rizz.\nThose doubting the power of rizz may wish to apply this test to every presidential election in their lifetimes: Did the winning candidate also win the rizz contest?\nUndertaker-face John Kerry lost to George W. Bush in 2004. John McCain, who looked like he walked off the set of a black-and-white television show, lost to Technicolor Barack Obama in 2008. Monotone Gerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter with his ear-to-ear grin and mellifluous diction in 1976.\nAnd a fist-in-the-air, \u201cFight\u201d-shouting Donald Trump \u2014 far from the cranky, complaining COVID case of 2020 \u2014 triumphed over word-salad chef Kamala Harris in 2024.\nFrank Meyer understood the power of rizz long before Twitch streamer Kai Cenat popularized the term.\nThey don\u2019t call them social movements for nothing.\nDaniel J.

      "text": "A day with the FBI: My perp walk, handcuffs, strip search and leg irons for a politically motivated misdemeanor\nIt is an interesting thing to suddenly lose one\u2019s freedom. It would be very interesting on this day, June 3, 2022.\nThe first thing FBI agents do when they grab you is pull your arms behind you and put you in handcuffs.\nNo matter how gently they might try to do it, it\u2019s still going to take a pretty good pull on your shoulder sockets. And in this case, they weren\u2019t particularly gentle.\nI no doubt appeared to these five armed FBI agents to be a very dangerous hombre. After all, I was 74 years old, I weigh 145 pounds soaking wet and top out at a gargantuan 5\u20197\u2033.\nOnce I was handcuffed, they walked me out the back door of the gangway at Reagan National Airport and down some portable steps onto the tarmac, where they had a tiny car waiting to transport me first back to the FBI headquarters \u2014 it\u2019s across the street from my apartment \u2014 and then eventually to the courthouse.\nAt the time, Walt Giardina seemed to actually be a kind of pleasant fellow when not armed to the teeth. He presented as the quintessential \u201cGood Nazi\u201d just \u201cdoing his duty\u201d without the courage to stand up to the FBI and Department of Justice.\nI would subsequently learn, however, from internal DOJ and FBI documents that Giardina was every bit a bad FBI seed who would willingly and willfully abuse power to advance partisan interests \u2014 think James Comey, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page. Giardina belongs right with them.\nSuch behavior is in all likelihood an enduring vestige of an organizational culture of fear and intimidation that dates back to the days of J. Edgar Hoover.\nLet\u2019s remember that when Hoover wasn\u2019t crossdressing and putting on lipstick for his own private cameras, he was abusing the FBI to spy on American icons like Martin Luther King and John and Bobby Kennedy and to gather dirt on as many congressmen as possible to make sure he would never get fired.\nPower has always corrupted, and the absolute power the FBI wields has always corrupted that anything-but-heroic agency.\nOnce I arrived at the HQ, I got my first taste of a truly evil FBI pr-ck. Big bald dude with bulging biceps who told me to keep my mouth shut and do exactly what I was told.\nAt least this dumb brute gave me my first of what would be three good laughs of my FBI day. It was indeed at least semi-hilarious, as said brute couldn\u2019t work his machine well enough to actually take my fingerprints.\nMy second laugh would quickly follow as Walt and his partner, who I nicknamed Clouseau, put me back in their Keystone Cops car and off we went to the District Court a few blocks away, where I would be arraigned.\nIt would have been the simplest thing in the world for me to walk the few blocks down that morning from my apartment and simply report to the court and thereby avoid all the guns, terrorism of my fianc\u00e9e and CNN theatrics.\nBut of course that would miss the Biden regime\u2019s weaponized point \u2014 perp walk and punish a Trump official to boost its reputation in the eyes of this country\u2019s adoring left wing.\nThe laugh came when these two clowns couldn\u2019t figure out just how to get into the building.\nThey had to circle it a couple of times while they made some frantic phone calls. Finally, they found the magic engine at the back of the building that opens up into a big freight elevator that swallows up your car and takes you down to the dungeon.\nLet the humiliating strip search begin.\nFirst, it was off with my tie and belt so I wouldn\u2019t hang myself in the cell. Don\u2019t worry, I certainly wasn\u2019t that desperate yet.\nSecond, there was the bend over and strip search. Hardly necessary unless you wanted to intimidate the prisoner, but hey, I was just along for their rough ride.\nThird, and this is where the fun really began, they put me in a pair of 15-pound leg irons. They assured me this was just \u201cprocedure\u201d that everybody got; how could they treat me any differently?\nFair enough. Why should I, a former White House official and senior adviser to the president, who had saved hundreds of thousands of lives and created hundreds of thousands of jobs and who had now been charged with a misdemeanor, be treated any better than the usual felonious parade of rapists, thieves, murderers, drug addicts, burglars, pimps and hookers they usually get to process in the court\u2019s dungeon?\nAll I could wonder at the time is whether this was what they were going to do to Donald Trump if they ever got their hands and handcuffs on him.\nMy last comic moment of the day would come when they walked me out of the strip-search area towards my cell.\nHere I am in leg irons, having been told to follow this big 6\u20192\u2033 guard with a long and brisk stride down a long and dimly lit hallway; and at best, all I could do is shuffle off to Buffalo to the cell awaiting me at a snail\u2019s pace.\nWhen I finally catch up with the guy after almost pulling a hamstring \u2014 nice-enough fellow I thanked for his service sincerely \u2014 he leads me into what would be my jail cell for the next several hours.\nFor whatever reason, he then goes out of his way to tell me this was the same jail cell John Hinckley sat in after he shot Ronald Reagan.\nFor the life of me, I couldn\u2019t find the moral equivalence there \u2014 a senior White House adviser who had failed to comply with a congressional subpoena out of duty to my country and my oath of office versus a deranged dude with a hard-on for Jodie Foster who thought trying to take out one of the best presidents in modern history would get him laid.\nI literally laughed out loud to the silence that now engulfed me.\nI got my first taste of prison life. Cold draft. Hard bench without padding. A crapper without a seat or toilet paper. Dim light and not a window in sight. No food at your fingertips. The total absence of any real colors of the rainbow.\nJust a drab, dismal world without clocks, where you are free \u2014 and I use the term as ironically and cynically as possible \u2014 to contemplate your navel or the cosmos.\nIf it doesn\u2019t kill you or bore you to death, it makes you stronger. Well F these Bidenites and jackboots, I thought, I choose stronger. So take your best shot. And that\u2019s exactly what they did.\nIt would take more than 600 days. But eventually the bastards did indeed put me in a federal prison.\nCopyright 2025 Peter Navarro and Bonnie Brenner.

  "argos_summary": "The piece attacks mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani for his ties to the Democratic Socialists of America, alleging the group pushes a radical agenda that includes abolishing the family, decriminalizing prostitution, and undermining traditional values. It portrays Mamdani as hypocritical\u2014promoting universal childcare while advocating for family abolition\u2014and warns that such ideas could lead to a communist takeover. The article also includes unrelated commentary on Canadian wildfire blame, a historical account of a former communist turned conservative, and a personal narrative about an FBI encounter, all woven together to paint a broader picture of political and social turmoil.",
