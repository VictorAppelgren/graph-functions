      "feedback": "Strong draft, but to reach world‑class quality you should tighten the causal chain, sharpen the horizon, and ground every claim in explicit, monitorable inputs. Edit guidance in one compact paragraph: restructure to a clean 0–48h, 3–7d, and 2–3w frame with explicit triggers (e.g., AL90 formation probability near 100% within 48h; potential track toward Bermuda; AL99 at ~20% development); state what would invalidate each scenario (e.g., AL90 fails to organize, track shifts poleward/away from Bermuda, or dissipates); tie each trigger to observable data (NHC advisories/formation probabilities from the 48h outlook and 7‑day outlook; current track models; CSU’s season projection of about 8 hurricanes with 3 majors and Florida’s 61% hurricane risk, 89% storm risk); quantify expected market/real‑economy impacts only where data exist (near‑term insurance/energy/shipping premia if Bermuda threat persists; otherwise fade); minimize non‑essential examples (tire pricing, generic NAS opinions) and foreground the two most relevant sources for the hurricane facet (NHC/AccuWeather/CSU: 0R5LB61YY, 11, 12) and the near‑term market transfer logic; ensure the causal chain is explicit: Fernand track risk drives coastal risk premia and insurance dynamics, Erin’s waning reduces immediate tail risk but Fernand can re‑price risk if its track strengthens; present a tight “watchlist” (NHC advisories AL90/AL99, CSU updates, insurance/energy signals) with concrete next data points to monitor; reconcile any conflicting signals (Erin vs Fernand trajectory, Florida risk vs broader basin risk) by labeling them as scenario variants rather than a single point forecast; and deliver a concise, source‑anchored paragraph that ends with a precise next‑step checklist (monitor nightly NHC updates on AL90/AL99, record any track/strength shifts toward Bermuda with probabilities, watch CSU’s hurricane tally and regional risk by state, and track insurance/energy price signals as they materialize).",
