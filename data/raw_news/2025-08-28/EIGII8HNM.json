      "text": "Hormel Foods (HRL)\nWe\u2019re wary of Hormel Foods. Its low returns on capital and plummeting sales suggest it struggles to generate demand and profits, a red flag.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Hormel Foods Will Underperform\nBest known for its SPAM brand, Hormel (NYSE:HRL) is a packaged foods company with products that span meat, poultry, shelf-stable foods, and spreads.\n- Annual sales declines of 1.5% for the past three years show its products struggled to connect with the market\n- Gross margin of 16.7% is below its competitors, leaving less money to invest in areas like marketing and production facilities\n- On the plus side, its economies of scale give it more fixed cost leverage than its smaller competitors\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Hormel Foods\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Hormel Foods\nAt $29.32 per share, Hormel Foods trades at 16.8x forward P/E. This multiple is lower than most consumer staples companies, but for good reason.\nWe\u2019d rather pay up for companies with elite fundamentals than get a bargain on weak ones. Cheap stocks can be value traps, and as their performance deteriorates, they will stay cheap or get even cheaper.\n3. Hormel Foods (HRL) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nPackaged foods company Hormel (NYSE:HRL) beat Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales up 4.6% year on year to $3.03 billion. On the other hand, next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance of $3.2 billion was less impressive, coming in 1.4% below analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.35 per share was 15% below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nHormel Foods (HRL) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $3.03 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.98 billion (4.6% year-on-year growth, 1.7% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.35 vs analyst expectations of $0.41 (15% miss)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $304.4 million vs analyst estimates of $367 million (10% margin, 17.1% miss)\n- Revenue Guidance for Q3 CY2025 is $3.2 billion at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $3.25 billion\n- Management lowered its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance to $1.44 at the midpoint, a 11.7% decrease\n- Operating Margin: 7.9%, in line with the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 2.8%, down from 5.3% in the same quarter last year\n- Sales Volumes rose 2.7% year on year (-6.9% in the same quarter last year)\n- Market Capitalization: $15.96 billion\nCompany Overview\nBest known for its SPAM brand, Hormel (NYSE:HRL) is a packaged foods company with products that span meat, poultry, shelf-stable foods, and spreads.\nEstablished in 1891 by George A. Hormel, the company started as a meatpacking operation. Throughout its history, Hormel has grown its business and expanded its portfolio through organic development as well as through mergers and acquisitions. The 1936 acquisition of SPAM was transformative, as was the 2013 deal to bring Skippy peanut butter into the portfolio.\nIn addition to its namesake brand, SPAM, and Skippy, the company also boasts the Planters (nuts), Applegate Farms (meats), Jennie-O (meats), and Justin\u2019s (spreads and snacks) brands. Hormel caters to low to middle-income households seeking convenience through trusted brands. The heads or caretakers of these households are usually busy and don\u2019t have the time to cook meals or prepare snacks from scratch. The company\u2019s products add convenience to everyday life, and they are often brands that customers have been eating since childhood.\nHormel products enjoy wide distribution. Supermarkets and grocery stores are the most common sellers of the company\u2019s products, but consumers can also find brands such as SPAM and Skippy in mass merchandisers and discount retailers that carry food.\n4. Shelf-Stable Food\nAs America industrialized and moved away from an agricultural economy, people faced more demands on their time. Packaged foods emerged as a solution offering convenience to the evolving American family, whether it be canned goods or snacks. Today, Americans seek brands that are high in quality, reliable, and reasonably priced. Furthermore, there's a growing emphasis on health-conscious and sustainable food options. Packaged food stocks are considered resilient investments. People always need to eat, so these companies can enjoy consistent demand as long as they stay on top of changing consumer preferences. The industry spans from multinational corporations to smaller specialized firms and is subject to food safety and labeling regulations.\nCompetitors in packaged food with a focus on meat include Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), Tyson (NYSE:TSN), and Pilgrim\u2019s Pride (NASDAQ:PPC).\n5. Revenue Growth\nExamining a company\u2019s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years.\nWith $12.06 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Hormel Foods is one of the larger consumer staples companies and benefits from a well-known brand that influences purchasing decisions. However, its scale is a double-edged sword because there are only a finite number of major retail partners, placing a ceiling on its growth. To accelerate sales, Hormel Foods likely needs to optimize its pricing or lean into new products and international expansion.\nAs you can see below, Hormel Foods\u2019s demand was weak over the last three years. Its sales fell by 1.5% annually as consumers bought less of its products.\nThis quarter, Hormel Foods reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 4.6% but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 1.7%. Company management is currently guiding for a 2% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 2.6% over the next 12 months. While this projection indicates its newer products will fuel better top-line performance, it is still below average for the sector.\n6. Volume Growth\nRevenue growth can be broken down into changes in price and volume (the number of units sold). While both are important, volume is the lifeblood of a successful staples business as there\u2019s a ceiling to what consumers will pay for everyday goods; they can always trade down to non-branded products if the branded versions are too expensive.\nHormel Foods\u2019s average quarterly sales volumes have shrunk by 2.3% over the last two years. This decrease isn\u2019t ideal because the quantity demanded for consumer staples products is typically stable.\nIn Hormel Foods\u2019s Q2 2025, sales volumes jumped 2.7% year on year. This result was a well-appreciated turnaround from its historical levels, showing the company is heading in the right direction.\n7. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nAt StockStory, we prefer high gross margin businesses because they indicate pricing power or differentiated products, giving the company a chance to generate higher operating profits.\nHormel Foods has bad unit economics for a consumer staples company, signaling it operates in a competitive market and lacks pricing power because its products can be substituted. As you can see below, it averaged a 16.6% gross margin over the last two years. Said differently, for every $100 in revenue, a chunky $83.39 went towards paying for raw materials, production of goods, transportation, and distribution.\nHormel Foods produced a 16.1% gross profit margin in Q2, in line with the same quarter last year but missing analysts\u2019 estimates by 9.6%. Zooming out, the company\u2019s full-year margin has remained steady over the past 12 months, suggesting its input costs (such as raw materials and manufacturing expenses) have been stable and it isn\u2019t under pressure to lower prices.\n8. Operating Margin\nHormel Foods\u2019s operating margin might fluctuated slightly over the last 12 months but has remained more or less the same, averaging 8.5% over the last two years. This profitability was higher than the broader consumer staples sector, showing it did a decent job managing its expenses.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Hormel Foods\u2019s operating margin might fluctuated slightly but has generally stayed the same over the last year. Shareholders will want to see Hormel Foods grow its margin in the future.\nIn Q2, Hormel Foods generated an operating margin profit margin of 7.9%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company\u2019s cost structure has recently been stable.\n9. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nIn Q2, Hormel Foods reported adjusted EPS of $0.35, down from $0.37 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Hormel Foods\u2019s full-year EPS of $1.47 to grow 20.9%.\n10. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nHormel Foods has shown decent cash profitability, giving it some flexibility to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 6.4% over the last two years, slightly better than the broader consumer staples sector.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Hormel Foods\u2019s margin dropped by 2.3 percentage points over the last year. If its declines continue, it could signal increasing investment needs and capital intensity.\nHormel Foods\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $84.5 million in Q2, equivalent to a 2.8% margin. The company\u2019s cash profitability regressed as it was 2.5 percentage points lower than in the same quarter last year, suggesting its historical struggles have dragged on.\n11. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nHormel Foods historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 9.5%, somewhat low compared to the best consumer staples companies that consistently pump out 20%+.\n12. Balance Sheet Assessment\nHormel Foods reported $630.7 million of cash and $2.86 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $1.33 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Hormel Foods\u2019s 1.7\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $39.34 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n13. Key Takeaways from Hormel Foods\u2019s Q2 Results\nIt was encouraging to see Hormel Foods beat analysts\u2019 revenue expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its full-year EPS guidance missed and its EBITDA fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, this was a weaker quarter. The stock traded down 7% to $26.97 immediately after reporting.\n14. Is Now The Time To Buy Hormel Foods?\nUpdated: August 28, 2025 at 6:40 AM EDT\nBefore deciding whether to buy Hormel Foods or pass, we urge investors to consider business quality, valuation, and the latest quarterly results.\nHormel Foods isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. For starters, its revenue has declined over the last three years. And while its favorable brand awareness gives it meaningful influence over consumers\u2019 dining decisions, the downside is its gross margins make it more challenging to reach positive operating profits compared to other consumer staples businesses. On top of that, its declining EPS over the last three years makes it a less attractive asset to the public markets.\nHormel Foods\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 16.3x. While this valuation is reasonable, we don\u2019t really see a big opportunity at the moment. We're fairly confident there are better stocks to buy right now.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $33 on the company (compared to the current share price of $26.97).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

  "argos_summary": "Hormel Foods reported Q2 revenue of $3.03\u202fbillion, up 4.6% YoY and beating estimates, but its non\u2011GAAP EPS of $0.35 fell 15% short of expectations and its Q3 revenue guidance of $3.2\u202fbillion is below analyst forecasts. Operating margin stayed at 7.9% while free\u2011cash\u2011flow margin dropped to 2.8% from 5.3% a year earlier, and sales volumes rose 2.7% YoY after a recent decline. Management has lowered full\u2011year EPS guidance to $1.44 and emphasized a need to restore profitable growth amid weak demand and low pricing power. Analysts remain cautious, citing declining sales, modest margins, and a lack of compelling growth prospects, suggesting better investment opportunities may exist elsewhere.",
