  "content": "The 5 Social Networks With The Most Active Users Today\n\nIf social media apps were a high-school cafeteria, these five platforms would be the ones hogging the biggest, coolest table. In the real-world, these networks have gone from humble dorm room dreams to global giants with billions of users glued to their screens. The platforms on this list have made the internet as we know it, breaking it and reshaping it over and over again. Nowadays, most sit under Meta's oversized umbrella, but each has carved its own lane. Billions of users, five wildly different personalities, and one thing in common \u2014 they've wormed their way into our daily routines, our conversations, and our lives. All of these social networks began as something else entirely; They used to go by a different name and had wildly different visions, or were owned and operated by other businesses. Each of them has now at least two billion monthly active users, putting them a notch above every other social network out there. Before we continue, if you're one of these active users, it might be worth your while to read up on the most important things you should never share on social media.\n\nYouTube might be the website that made \"content creator\" into a real job title. It was never following trends because it was too busy inventing them, at least until YouTube shorts started taking on TikTok. YouTube's dream started in 2005, way before sub-60 second trends and Instagram aesthetics. Back then, there were no other significant video sharing platforms. Soon after, YouTube was acquired by Google for $1.65 billion in stock. It quickly became one of the most popular websites on the internet, populated mostly by common people who had something to say, who picked up their little camcorders and non-smart phones, and hit upload. Somehow, that was more than enough. Content creation did not begin there \u2014 blogs and even vlogs predate YouTube by quite a few years \u2014 but it's where an entire generation that now lives and breathes online storytelling first cut its teeth. YouTube is one of the few popular social networks that sidelines DM's and direct communication. Meanwhile, as a content delivery platform, it's one of the few that is explicitly not just about entertainment. It plays a critical role in education and journalism, for one \u2014 \"graduated from YouTube University\" is a meme many resonate with. And of course, YouTube is incredibly popular, and incredibly lucrative. YouTube Shorts are viewed over 70 billion times every day, YouTube Premium offers an ad-free experience (for a price), and ad blockers are fought ever more fiercely. That said, there's a reason why this is still one of the most popular social media apps to try out.\n\nWhat makes WhatsApp so special? On paper, it's just another platform to send off a text and talk to someone \u2014 something your mobile's been doing since it could fit in your pocket. Yet here it is, holding down a 3 billion monthly active users fort spread out over 180 countries. Why? It's hard to say, but its ease of use probably helped quite a bit. No ads, no fluff; just free, fast, end-to-end encrypted messaging sent through the internet. At least, that used to be the case until the summer of 2025, when WhatsApp confirmed that ads are now coming to the platform. What started as an \"SMS, but better\" app somehow ended up as the world's go-to communication line; It's hardly a surprise that WhatsApp is only getting ads now, when it's harder to jump ship for a robust alternative chat app. Born in 2009, WhatsApp was the brainchild of Brian Acton and Jan Koum, two former Yahoo employees. Interestingly, it was first released as an iPhone only app, and it was paid \u2014 though the subscription was only $1 per year, with the first year being free. The app was soon bought by Facebook, and by 2016, it was free to use. The app is currently most popular in India, with Brazil a close second, but it's used more or less everywhere. While it may be one of the world's leading social networks, WhatsApp hasn't escaped controversy. Somewhere along the way, the app became a key tool in extremist plots and the human smuggling trade. From coordinating routes to upselling VIP border crossings and facing government bans in China and Iran, it sparked global debate and has long been under the limelight.\n\nPart gallery, part diary, part stage, and a cornerstone of the influencer era: This is the social network that Instagram has become today. Who knew a simple squared-photo app would reshape the world? Currently under the Meta umbrella, Instagram was originally a quirky location-based app named Burbn, before getting a glow-up from Stanford graduates Kevin Systorm and Mike Kreiger. It was first released to the public in 2010 and was downloaded by 25,000 users on its first day, foreshadowing future success. While it seems all sparkle and glamour from the outside, Instagram has been berated for pushing unrealistic beauty standards and fueling eating disorders in particular, helping the spread of misinformation, and not being proactive enough to stop trolls. On the brighter side, Meta has rolled out several settings under Content Preferences, including an option called \"limit political content from people you don't follow\". While this might look like a rare benevolent move from the Meta corporation, the company has since admitted this development was necessary to avoid backlash for promoting political content. Either way, this toggle, along with some other Instagram features, can change how you use the social media app.\n\nVine's spiritual successor and formerly a lip-syncing app named Musical.ly, TikTok is one of the five social networks with the most active users today. It's the newest app on our list, launching in 2016, and is notorious for its bite-sized and (generally) high-energy videos. If we had to pick one word that most describes TikTok, it would be Compelling \u2014 it has one of the highest social media engagement rate per post of any app, and 18% of all internet users are on TikTok. Whether that's a good thing or not, you'll have to decide for yourself. Of course, it's not just the content that's kept TikTok in the spotlight for so long. The other reason it has gained so much attention is the fact that it's Chinese-owned, making this platform a political lightning rod. India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan have already imposed restrictions on the app in the past \u2014 though those were not always related to its ownership \u2014 and the U.S. government has been threatening a potential ban since the start of 2025. The ban ended up going into effect but was only enforced for a few weeks, when the app was allowed to return to mobile stores in a dramatic turn of events. Controversy or not, today TikTok is popular with users as well as brands, with names like e.l.f. Cosmetics and the NBA behind some of the most successful marketing campaigns in the app's history.\n\nDoesn't matter if the only \"cloud\" you know is full of clouds instead of files. You don't need to be the most technologically-minded person to have brushed shoulders with Facebook at some point in your life. Chances are, you either have an account, in use or gathering digital dust, or you used to have one before you decided you needed to delete your Facebook account. Maybe you spent your childhood or your teens playing Farmville on your Facebook account, or maybe that's how you reconnected with old school friends. Almost everyone of a certain age has some sort of tie to Facebook; It's practically a rite of passage. An average of 3.07 billion monthly active users makes Facebook the crowning jewel of social networks today. What started as a modest college directory in a Harvard dorm room has now become Meta's golden child. Legend has it that Facebook rose from the ashes of a cheeky little prank site called Facemash \u2014 a controversial hot-or-not website that let students rank each other based on attractiveness. It's unclear if Facebook is really based on that old website, but the timeline is messy enough to make it hard to exclude the possibility. Either way, that's not the Facebook we know today. From fake accounts running rampant to awful default privacy settings, what makes Facebook terrible now is completely unrelated to its past.",

      "text": "5 Things You Should Never Share On Social Media\nWe live in the social media age and, for better or worse, most of us are active participants. As we post stories to Instagram about our daily lives, use AI tools to strengthen our LinkedIn profile, or engage in heated discussions with internet strangers on X, these platforms can begin to feel like an extension of who we are. But the more you use these apps, the more you risk sharing too much information, ultimately putting you or your family in danger.\nIt's easy to believe the people we've chatted with from our devices are truly friends and have our best interests at heart. We may forget that the internet is forever and how easily anything we post can be screenshotted and shared with people around the globe.\nWhen we share too much about ourselves on social media, we draw a target on our backs, making ourselves vulnerable to all sorts of risks, such as identity theft, scams, and personal attacks. That doesn't mean you should delete all of your accounts and commit to leading a life without social media. Instead, you should try to find a balance and be mindful about what you share online. Here are some suggestions.\nSafeguard your personal information\nThere's no getting around it, a lot of your personal information is already online. Even if you rarely post to social media, there's a good chance that a friend, family member, or acquaintance has tagged you in a photo or mentioned you in a post, which can potentially put you at risk. While you could make a special request that nobody in your circle ever post anything about you, you probably don't want to go to that extreme. However, knowing what personal details are possibly lurking on the web can help you protect yourself from the different types of cyberattacks scammers might target you with.\nCybercriminals are always trolling social media for tidbits of information that can help them do things like break into your accounts or apply for a credit card in your name. You should avoid posting unique identifying information on social media, including your birthdate, cities you've lived in, the year you graduated from high school or college, your age, or your address.\nScammers don't just use this personal information to break into your accounts or impersonate you. They might also use it to send you personalized phishing messages that get you to hand over even more of your information. If you realize your personal information has been compromised, it's a good idea to change the security questions you usually use to get into online accounts to ensure scammers can't use the information about you that's already been shared online.\nDon't share travel plans\nIf you're like most people, you get excited when you have a trip planned and want to share that excitement with others. Social media is one of the most common ways to do this because it's an easy way to let your entire network know about your upcoming plans and share pictures and anecdotes about your journey. We've all seen posts where friends share their boarding passes or announce their departure from a specific airport with a Facebook check-in. While your friends may enjoy keeping up with your travels, and you may enjoy sharing them, doing so can put you at risk, especially if your posts are public.\nWhen you share your whereabouts on social media, you give potential criminals a heads-up that you won't be home, potentially making your home a target for burglary and other crimes. Sharing your boarding pass may seem innocent, but it reveals all sorts of information, including your full name. The data on your board pass, including barcodes and QR codes, can be used to look up your booking information too, including your email address, itinerary, phone number, and emergency contact.\nOnce you arrive, avoid uploading photos that reveal your location. The safest option is to wait until you return before posting pictures to social media. However, if you decide to share a few photos of your travels, turn off geotags and post them after you've left the location.\nPhotos and information about children\nAs a proud parent, it's hard not to share information about your kids with your social network, also known as sharenting. All anyone has to do is scroll through social media platforms like Instagram or Facebook to see how common sharenting is, and many people don't think twice about it. While sharing photos of your kids will likely garner lots of likes, the risks may outweigh the benefits. When posting pictures of your kids online, it's important to remember that you can't control what others do with that information. Your minor children can't consent to what you post about them either, and they may be upset if they find it years later.\nAlthough those photos and videos of your child's first steps or kindergarten graduation may seem innocent enough, bad actors can glean a lot of information from these posts. Even after changing your Facebook privacy settings, it's probably a good idea to limit what you post. After all, people can screenshot anything on the page, and it's almost impossible to keep track of where your child's photo will end up after that. If a cybercriminal gets access to a post about your child, they could figure out things like your child's name, birthdate, and location, putting them at risk for identity theft.\nYour posts may also inadvertently end up exposing your kids to child predators. If you don't remove the photo's metadata, predators can use that information to track your child's location.\nContent That Can Compromise Your Safety\nEven when you're staying close to home, you should avoid sharing information about what you're doing on social media until after the fact. You may figure that since many of your social media contacts already know where you live, there's no real harm in letting them know the restaurant where you're having dinner or the park you're visiting on the weekend. However, that couldn't be further from the truth.\nBesides making it easier for online advertisers to access your personal data, when you share your location online, you open yourself up to being tracked by stalkers who can learn about your movements and interests, making it easy for them to track your daily habits.\nSharing information about your valuables on social media is also a bad idea. You may want to let everyone know how satisfied you are with the reliable hybrid car you just bought, but that's usually not a good idea. While it could be an interesting topic of conversation, sharing this information could make you a target for car theft. That same goes for anything you have of value, including jewelry, electronics, and artwork, because it lets thieves know what they're likely to encounter if they break into your home.\nFake News or Scammy Giveaways\nIt's almost impossible to avoid fake news and scams on social media these days. Worse, scammers have perfected their art form to such an extent that it's often difficult to differentiate between fact and fiction on social media. Part of the problem is that social media algorithms often pick up these fakes and scams, and spread them far and wide.\nHowever, there are things you can do to mitigate the spread of harmful posts, including using fact-checking organizations to verify claims, being skeptical of sensational and overly dramatic headlines, and waiting until you can confirm the information is true before sharing it on social media.\nFake giveaways are also common on social media, with scammers using fake prizes and lottery scams to trick people into paying money or giving up account information. If you receive a message on social media, you may be tempted to share it with your friends and followers. Common scams include giveaways on Facebook or Instagram that ask you to comment on a post for a chance to win.\nWhile this may seem innocent, scammers often use these posts for like-farming. Once they've accumulated enough likes for the contest to appear credible, they'll add a link to a scam website or malware. While some giveaways may be legitimate, you should also research the company before participating or sharing them with others."

      "text": "Instagram Features That Will Change How You Use The Social Media App\nDespite the rise of competitors like Snapchat and TikTok, Instagram remains one of the most popular social media apps out there. Instagram has maintained this spot because it quickly implements features that rival its competitors, such as the inclusion of Reels after the rise of TikTok. Whether you like following friends and celebrities, getting inspiration for creative projects, or just laughing at memes, Instagram is an excellent platform regardless of what you use it for.\nIf you want to take your social media game to the next level, Instagram has several hidden features that can turn you into a social media wizard. Whether you are managing multiple accounts, trying to run a business, or just trying to filter what content you see, Instagram has a robust suite of features to meet your needs. Here are 10 Instagram features that will change how you use the app in your day-to-day life.\nAdd and manage multiple accounts\nIf you manage multiple Instagram accounts, you'll be happy to know you can add more than one account to a single device. This is great if you are a social media manager working with multiple brands, run your own business and want to keep your personal account separate, or just run a meme page on the side.\nTo add an account, click on the profile icon in the bottom right corner, which will take you to your profile. Click on the user name at the top and select Add Account from the drop menu. From there, you can either add an account you already have up and running or create a new one.\nTo switch back and forth between the accounts, just head back to your profile and tap the username. Every account you are logged into will appear. You can also double-tap the profile icon to quickly switch between different accounts.\nBroadcast Channels lets you communicate directly with your audience\nDo you wish you could communicate more directly with your Instagram followers? Meta, the company that owns and manages Instagram, wishes you could too. That's why the company is beta testing a feature called Broadcast Channels. This new feature allows creators to send text, audio, photos, and even video directly to their followers via the Instagram inbox.\nBroadcast Channels are being beta tested and will slowly be made available to more creators. Once you have access to the Broadcast Channel feature, you can access it from the Inbox. You can also put out a blast on your Story and invite followers to join it.\nIf Instagram is your primary social media platform, this is a great way to connect with followers without encouraging them to head to another app like Patreon or Discord. With any luck, it will be a powerful community-building tool that will help you build a more personal relationship with your audience.\nReorder filters\nFilters are one of the signature tools of Instagram. Being able to fine-tune your photos and create the look you want is one of the things that attracted users to Instagram in the first place.\nIf you're like most people, you probably have a handful of go-to filters, and everything else is mostly unused. That's fine, and it's actually a good thing if you want to keep a consistent look across your Instagram profile. However, it can be a little annoying to scroll through all those unused filters just to find the one or two you like.\nHowever, did you know you can rearrange the filters? The next time you go to create a new post, don't rush through the filter screen. Instead, find a filter you like and press and hold until the filter floats away from the others. Then you can drag it toward the front of the queue. Instagram will remember the positioning for next time, and you'll never have to scroll through them again. It makes editing your best smartphone photos that much easier.\nEasily add new lines to captions and bios\nCaptions are really great for communicating with your audience, and they are about the only way to do so outside of individually messaging users. However, if you have a lot to say in a caption, it can quickly turn into a huge block of text. Of course, no one wants to read a big block of words on Instagram. It's more accessible and readable if the sentences are broken up a little.\nTo do this, though, users always had to find some sort of workaround. Instagram did not have a native way to include line breaks. Some users would even write the caption in their Notes app and then paste it into Instagram to get the line breaks.\nThat's all in the past now, though. By tapping the return key on the keyboard, users can add a line break while typing out the caption in the app. iPhone users will need to hit the 123 button to access the return key. This is a huge quality-of-life improvement for users, and it's baffling that the feature has been missing for this long.\nAdd notifications for your favorite accounts\nThe Instagram algorithm is constantly changing, and one of the effects of those changes is that fewer posts are shown in chronological order. Your home feed is also more than likely to include people you don't even follow. If you want to keep up with very specific accounts, such as family members or creators you really like, you will want to turn on notifications.\nTo turn on notifications for an account, head to the user's profile. Make sure you are following them and then hit the bell icon in the corner. From here, you can decide if you want to receive notifications for posts, live videos, reels, and more. This is great if you feel like you aren't seeing who you want in your feed and you don't want to miss anything important that your favorite accounts post.\nWith notifications on, you'll get a ping every time those accounts post, which is an even better way to make sure you see their content than adding them to your favorites.\nUse shoppable posts to sell products\nInstagram is a great place to promote your business, especially if you sell physical products. However, instead of redirecting users to a third-party site, you can actually sell your inventory directly on Instagram with shoppable posts.\nTo do this, you will need to make sure you have a Facebook Business account that is connected to your Instagram profile. You will need to upgrade your Instagram account to a business profile. From there, use the Facebook Business profile to create a shopping catalog and add your items.\nOnce that is in order, head back to Instagram, create a post, then tag a relevant item from your Facebook Business catalog. Users will see the tag, which will redirect them to a link to purchase the product right in the app. If you're doing any online retail that interacts that reaches customers on Instagram, this is a must-have feature to promote and sell your products.\nUse collections to curate content\nInstagram is an excellent place to browse ideas for home decor, cooking, and a myriad of other things. While at first glance it doesn't seem as effective as Pinterest because there isn't a clear way to save and organize what you see in the app, it turns out there is a way to keep all those posts you like. In fact, you can even organize them into collections for later perusing.\nTo save a photo to a collection, hit the bookmark icon to the far right, separate from the other icons underneath an Instagram post. The app will automatically save that post to a general collection, but a notification will appear on the photo that reads Add To Collection. Click on this and you will see an option to select the collection you want to add it to or create a new one.\nTo access these collections, go to your profile and hit the three lines in the top corner. From there, tap Collections and all your saved photos will appear in neatly organized groups.\nLimit your screen time\nIf you feel like you're on Instagram way too much \u2014 as we all occasionally do \u2014 you can monitor all of your time spent in the app. If you feel like you're spending way too much time on it, you can limit your time entirely. Head to your profile, tap the three lines in the corner, then hit Your Activity.\nFrom there, hit Time Spent in the Your Activity menu. Instagram will show you a seven-day chart of your activity and the daily average you spend on the app. From there, you can set reminders to take breaks, adjust certain notification settings, and set a daily time limit.\nToo much social media can have negative effects, so having a feature like this to help you control your screen time is a net gain for your mental health. Taking advantage of it could help you feel better and feel more productive. It can also be a great tool for parents to cap time on Instagram for their kids.\nTurn off activity status\nSome people use Instagram as a primary means of communication, but that can be pretty overwhelming for others. If you are tired of your friends and family pestering you when you are online, you can hide your activity status.\nGo to your profile, hit the three-line icon, find the Settings menu, and then hit Privacy. From there, scroll down until you see Activity Status, where you will see two options to toggle on or off. Show Activity Status will tell people if you are online and the last time you were active. You can toggle this off to hide it, but it also stops you from seeing other users' activity status.\nThe other option is Show When You're Active Together. This shows when you are active in the same chat as other online users. It's a great tool to see who is currently in a group chat, but you can also turn it off if you would rather not see this.\nHide ads to better filter your feed\nAds are a blessing and a curse. For every ad you see that might actually be something that interests you, there are a dozen or so that are just annoying and unnecessary. If you feel like this is your experience, or you keep seeing the same ads over and over again, you can actually filter out the ones you don't want to see.\nIf you encounter an ad you don't like, hit the three dots in the top right corner, and a submenu will appear. At the top of that menu, you will see an option to hide that ad. If you select it, Instagram won't recommend it to you anymore. If you feel like the ad is offensive or inappropriate, you can also report it.\nNot only does this help you see less annoying ads, but it also helps inform the algorithm on what ads you are interested in seeing. If your feed is going to have ads on it anyways, they may as well be about things you are at least partially interested in learning about."

      "text": "YouTube Ramps Ups Its Efforts In Fight Against Ad Blockers\nAd blocking has been a contentious issue in the realm of online advertising. While the basic idea behind ad blockers is to let users enjoy content without intrusive ads, it poses significant challenges for content creators and video-sharing platforms.\nBecause these entities rely heavily on advertising revenue to sustain their operations, ad-blocking tools essentially prevent them from making money, even as users consume their content for free.\nInterestingly, despite the massive proliferation of ad-blocking tools, YouTube chose to largely ignore the problem. However, as YouTube and Google struggle to make money due to the effects of the global financial slowdown and the mounting threat posed by ad blockers, YouTube has decided to adopt a more aggressive approach to protect its revenue streams.\nA recent post on Reddit gives us the first glimpse of what things may look like once YouTube enforces a strict ad-blocking ban. The post includes a screenshot of a message that YouTube intends to display to users who may have enabled an adblocker:\nUnlike YouTube's previous attempts that merely requested people to stop using ad blockers, this more aggressive stance would result in three \"strikes\" to the viewer. After the three strikes, YouTube will block the YouTube player from playing back any more videos. Note that these \"strikes\" do not adversely affect the standing of the signed-in account.\nHow will YouTube's ad block strike policy work?\nAs mentioned earlier, this three-strike policy will be \"activated\" once YouTube detects an ad-blocking tool during an active user session. Once detected, YouTube will let users view three videos before blocking its media player from playing any additional content.\nOnce users come across the message, they would either be required to disable the ad-blocking tool entirely, or add YouTube to the list of \"allowed sites.\" In case the user ignores the message, they will not be able to view any more videos until they comply with YouTube's demand.\nIf YouTube implements this policy, it will make it one of the most aggressive stances the video-sharing platform would take against ad-blocking tools. Given that the majority of YouTube users have not yet seen this message, chances are that the company is still testing this feature. It is still unclear whether YouTube intends to widely implement this policy across its global user base.\nNevertheless, it would be interesting to see how the platform's massive user base responds to this move. There is no denying that this three-strike ad-blocking policy would be welcomed by creators. However, users currently using ad blockers for a less intrusive, seamless YouTube experience (without paying for Premium, of course) may experience a disruption in their flow of content consumption, if this is indeed the way forward."

      "text": "YouTube Shorts To Take On TikTok, Bedtime Reminders Coming Soon\nTikTok unsurprisingly saw a sudden surge in new users within the past days but the social network's history hasn't always been bright. After quickly taking over the Internet, its connections to the Chinese government cast it in a less favorable light, at least among the security and privacy-conscious population. Despite that, TikTok continues to thrive mostly because it remains unrivaled. That, however, might soon come to an end with YouTube Shorts.\nTikTok's popularity could probably be credit for its simplicity more than ingenuity. In a way, it combined Vine's once-popular short video format, Instagram's looping Boomerang and the ability to select music from a free library of audio clips. Of course, there have been other copycats since then but it might take a giant like YouTube to truly challenge the current champ.\nThe Information reports that YouTube is planning on releasing a new feature simply called \"Shorts\" that has the exact same functionality. It would allow users to record short videos and select from background audio from YouTube's catalog of licensed content which is bound to be larger than anything TikTok can offer. YouTube's popularity and its sizable library could very well turn the tide away from the Chinese social network upstart.\nSigns of this Shorts features were verified by XDA's teardown of the YouTube Android app, revealing text related to uploading and playback options. The site speculates that it would be limited to certain YouTubers with a minimum number of subscribers, just like the platform's existing Stories feature.\nXDA also discovered clues about a Bedtime Reminder to keep tabs on users' prolonged use of the app during these times. Users can set a time when they'll be reminded to go to bed but could also set it to only remind you after you've finished watching the current video."

      "text": "How To Spot A Fake Account On Facebook Using These Warning Signs\nFacebook will always be considered one of the popular social media platforms. The best thing about Facebook is its user interface, which allows anyone to create a new profile without much hassle. However, the smooth account creation process also makes it easier for bad actors to create fake accounts. According to Cybernews, Facebook has deleted more than 27.67 billion fake accounts since October 2017, which is almost three times the current world population. That's definitely a shocking number.\nOne of the main agendas of the people who are behind these fake accounts is to scam legitimate Facebook users. They'll try their best to impersonate a real account and trick you into giving them your personal information or even transferring some money. Furthermore, they might even send you a suspicious link or files in messages, interacting with which may spread malware or viruses on your device. To ensure you don't become a victim of a fake Facebook account, you must carefully examine the profile before adding it to your friend list. Here are a few of the warning signs that will help you spot a fake Facebook account.\nHow to catch a fake Facebook profile\nFirstly, you should only accept friend requests from people whom you know in real life. However, it might be possible that a bad actor will create a fake profile of someone you know in order to scam you. To avoid such a situation, whenever you receive a friend request from someone whom you know in real life, you should contact and ask them personally whether they have sent you a friend request on Facebook. If not, then you should immediately delete that friend request and report that account.\nNext, you should examine the profile picture. Oftentimes, a fake Facebook profile will have a generic or an AI-generated profile picture. You can use the reverse image search feature to check if that profile picture is being used somewhere else on the internet. If the profile picture appears genuine, the next thing you should check is their friend list. Fake profiles often lack genuine profiles as their friends, especially those who are mutual to you. Furthermore, most accounts in the list will be very random; they will all be from different countries, or even worse, they will all be fake accounts themselves.\nThe timeline is another thing that you should examine to determine if a Facebook account is real or fake. If a profile is real, their timeline will likely be filled with posts, comments, and other interactions on Facebook. Furthermore, they will have the bio and intro section of Facebook filled with correct information like where they work, their relationship status, and other personal details. If you find inconsistency in any of these things, there's a high possibility that it's a fake account.\nHow to report a fake Facebook profile\nOnce you have spotted a fake profile, the next thing you need to do is report it to Facebook. Here's how to do it through the Facebook app.\n- Go to the Facebook profile that you think is fake, tap the three dots, and choose the Report profile option.\n- Choose Fake Profile.\n- Select who that fake Facebook profile is impersonating.\n- Hit the Submit button.\nMeta will also provide other actions that you would like to perform with that account, like blocking it from your Facebook friend list and Messenger, or hiding all their posts. Select either of these options if you want. The Meta team will then carefully use different standards and technology to monitor the reported profile. If they come to the conclusion that the profile is indeed fake, they will remove that account from Facebook. You will be notified about their decision, whether they have removed the reported fake profile or not, in your Facebook notification box."

      "text": "8 Robust Chat Alternatives To WhatsApp\nTexting has become little more than a quick way to fire a simple message off to someone you've only a casual acquaintance with, or those few holdouts still using dumb phones. Everyone else is likely connected with you through a chatting app, most of which now offer features like sending audio snippets, files, high-quality emoticons, and more. WhatsApp has been a long-reigning champ when it comes to chatting apps, and there's a good chance you either use it or have used it in the past...and, like many, you might not be so fond of the app.\nFortunately, there are loads of options out there, and quite a few of them are robust and solid alternatives to WhatsApp. We've detailed eight of them below, all of which support the major mobile operating systems and include the features you enjoyed \u2013 plus some \u2013 while using WhatsApp.\n1. Threema\nThreema is a chatting app for those who are concerned about privacy, offering users end-to-end encryption and removing the common requirements to verify your phone number and provide a name. Still, Threema offers the features users enjoyed on WhatsApp, including voice messaging and content sharing.\nDownloads available for Android, iOS, Windows Phone, and Amazon.\n2. Viber\nViber doesn't require users to register, and gives a full suite of features to users \u2014 there's free voice calling between a pair of Viber users, for example, as well as common staples like texting and photo messaging.\nDownloads available for iOS, Android, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, Nokia, and Windows 8.\n3. Kik\nKik managed to find favor with the younger generation, and if you've a teenager in the house you've likely at least heard about it. Though a staple amongst high school users, the chatting app is a solid option for anyone looking to chat with their friends and family. It offers content sharing with chat contacts, group chats, in-app content browsing and sharing, and more.\nDownloads available for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.\n4. LINE\nYou've likely heard of LINE by this point, considering how popular it is \u2013 and that popularity means there's a good chance at least a few of your friends are using it. LINE provides video and voice calls, texting and content sharing, and a huge array of expressive \"stamps\" and some related offerings like Camera and games.\nDownloads available for Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Nokia, BlackBerry, and Firefox OS.\n5. Skype\nSkype is another one of those popular options that you've likely used at one point or perhaps are using now. If you used the service in the past and found it to be too sluggish or bloated for your system, now's the time to give it another shot. Skype allows for free voice and video calls between users, as well as real-time chatting and an option for calling landline numbers, and it plays well with most devices.\nDownloads available for Android, iOS, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, Amazon, and Nokia X.\n6. Hangouts\nGoogle Talk has come a long way, and the current iteration \u2013 Hangouts \u2013 has matured nicely over the years. Users can chat in real time in-browser or on mobile devices, share files, video chat, and more. Logs are easily accessible in one's Gmail account, and is a good option for those already well integrated into Google's other services.\nDownloads available for Android and iOS.\n7. WeChat\nWeChat doesn't have the same level of well-known popularity that Viber and Kik have, but that doesn't mean it is lacking in features. There's group chatting, stickers, video chats, free calls between users, and broadcast messages. Updates are pushed out regularly, and the design is attractive.\nDownloads available for Android, BlackBerry, iOS, Windows Phone, and Nokia.\n8. Facebook Messenger\nPerhaps you gave up on Facebook a while ago, leaving behind a profile that has sat unattended but otherwise whole. If you're looking for a robust chat alternative to WhatsApp, downloading and firing up Facebook Messenger might be a good option, the biggest reason being due to how many other people already use it. You're probably FB friends with most of the people in your contacts, and so chatting with them will be as fast as dusting off that old profile and downloading Messenger.\nDownloads available for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone."

      "text": "Why You Need To Delete, Not Just Deactivate, Your Facebook Account\nFacebook may be the 800-pound gorilla of social media platforms, but the company's business practices are leading many users to abandon it. In recent years, Facebook has been embroiled in one scandal and issue after another and has become synonymous with abuse of privacy. The Cambridge Analytica scandal was one of the biggest such examples, with the private data of tens of millions of users misused for political reasons (via The New York Times). Users are also coming to the realization that, as with many free services, the user is the product. Facebook doesn't provide the services it does out of the goodness of its heart \u2014 it counts on being able to collect, mine, and monetize every scrap of data it can from its users.\nBeyond privacy, there are also issues with misinformation and toxic behavior, issues that have led many to decide it's time to part ways with the platform. Despite Facebook making it possible to disable or delete an account, there are substantial differences between the two options.\nDisabling A Facebook Account\nIf you're looking to break free from Facebook, disabling an account is a good first step that accomplishes a number of things. Disabling an account makes it impossible for other people to look up your account, see your pictures, or follow your timeline. Your name will also be removed from most things, such as comments on other people's photos, although the comment itself will remain. Per the company's information, disabled accounts can still use Messenger as well.\nMost significantly, however, Facebook retains all of your data when an account is disabled. Facebook ultimately wants you to come back to the platform, not abandon it entirely. Therefore, the company keeps your data, ready and waiting for your return.\nAs a result, while disabling an account may be a good option for someone looking for a temporary break from Facebook, that's exactly what disabling an account is \u2014 a temporary option, not a permanent solution.\nDeleting A Facebook Account\nIndividuals looking to truly break up with Facebook are far better off deleting their account.\nDeleting an account completely severs your ties to Facebook's primary platform. That means you will not be able to access Messenger, your photos, or any pages you have created and are the administrator for. During the deletion process, Facebook will also give you the opportunity to download a copy of your data, including any photos you have uploaded.\nFacebook will also delete your information once you delete an account, although not right away. Once you opt to delete your account, Facebook takes 30 days to process the deletion, during which time your account is essentially deactivated, just like it would be if you manually deactivated it. This also means you have a 30-day grace period to reactive your account if you change your mind. After those 30 days, however, your account and information should be deleted from Facebook's servers.\nIf you are truly concerned about Facebook having your data, monetizing it, or sharing it with other companies, deletion is definitely the way to go."

      "text": "5 Facebook Privacy Settings You Need To Change\nAs one of the biggest and still one of the most widely used social media platforms out there, Facebook holds a lot of data on its users. If you have an account, chances are high that you may be inadvertently exposing information that you don't necessarily want certain audiences to see. Because Facebook routinely updates its app with new features \u2014 some of them are enabled by default \u2014 it's important to make it a habit to check your privacy and security settings, which you can easily do on either a mobile device or a desktop computer.\nFacebook has a built-in privacy checkup tool that is conveniently accessible by hitting your profile icon and launching the \"Settings & privacy\" page (it's the gear icon). It should be able to guide you through crucial settings you should be aware of to keep your account contents secure. Alternatively, you can manually go down the list of every menu listed in Facebook's settings, which is the more thorough and preferred method if you have the time. Do note that the \"Settings & privacy\" dropdown on the Facebook app looks a bit different when viewed on the desktop platform, so certain pages may be nested under additional menus.\nTo help you get started, here are some of the more important Facebook privacy settings you should modify \u2014 and in some cases, routinely update \u2014 according to your preferences.\nProfile visibility\nThe first set of privacy settings that is arguably the most important one you should tweak is the one that controls who can view your personal data. This includes your contact information, birthday, location, work and education history, and your posts, to name some. Below are steps on how to find these details.\nThrough the app:\n- While on the main page, tap your profile photo.\n- Hit the gear icon to get to \"Settings & privacy.\"\n- Scroll down to the \"Audience and visibility\" section.\n- Select \"Profile details.\"\nThrough a computer web browser:\n- Go to your profile page.\n- Select the About tab.\n- Go through each menu in the side panel.\nHere, you'll see several sections like Work, Education, Places lived, Contact info, and so on. Go through every entry and hit Edit or the pencil icon where it's shown next to it. This will let you tweak each one's privacy settings and change the \"Sharing with\" option from Public to either Friends, Only me, or any custom group. Hit Save when applicable to retain any modifications made. For Contact info, there's an additional step of choosing Manage contact info to set up each phone number and email address' audience.\nIf you're accessing Facebook on a computer web browser, each item in your About section should have an audience button next to it, alongside a three-dot icon to edit the entry.\nFacebook friends list and searchability\nThe next set of settings you should get into is the one pertaining to how people can find and contact you. Limiting these permissions can decrease the number of strangers attempting to communicate with you on the platform. Another crucial bit that many Facebook users tend to forget is protecting their friends list from outside view \u2014 doing so makes it harder for people to scam your acquaintances by pretending to be you or scam you by pretending to be someone you know. Below are instructions on how to get to these settings.\nVia the app:\n- While on the main page, tap your profile photo.\n- Hit the gear icon to get to \"Settings & privacy.\"\n- Scroll down to the \"Audience and visibility\" section.\n- Select \"How people find and contact you.\"\nOn Facebook via desktop, all these relevant settings are under the Privacy Settings and Tools page, under the \"How people find and contact you\" section. The following settings for each menu are highly recommended:\n- Who can send you friend requests: \"Friends of friends.\"\n- Who can see your friends list: \"Only me\" or \"Specific friends.\" If you choose the latter, pick contacts you trust the most, like your significant other or a couple of in-case-of-emergency friends.\nYou also have the option of limiting who can look you up using your email address or phone number. For the sake of privacy, pick any audience except Everyone. In addition, you can stop search engines outside of Facebook from linking to your profile when someone tries to Google you by disabling the option.\nPosts and tagging permissions\nThe last set of audience-related settings you should safeguard has to do with the content you share. On the app, you can find these preferences when you tap Posts under the \"Audience and visibility\" section. On a computer web browser, they will be in the Privacy Settings and Tools page under Your Activity. For \"Who can see your future posts,\" it's recommended that you opt for Friends as your default audience. You can always tweak any specific post's individual audience preferences while composing it.\nThere's also a nifty tool that lets you limit the audience for past posts in one go. This is especially important if you have shared several entries in the past that are set to Public that you would now like to protect. Do note that in using this, you're automatically setting all your posts on your timeline to Friends only permanently. The only way to undo this is by individually changing the audience of all previous posts. In any case, anyone tagged in posts and their friends may still be able to view the audience-modified entries.\nSpeaking of, the next step should be to look into who can tag you in posts. On both the app and desktop platforms, this can be found in Profile and Tagging under the \"Audience and visibility\" settings for the former. On this page, not only can you dictate who can see posts you're tagged in, but you can also modify who gets to post on your profile or who gets to view those entries. If you prefer to be in control of which posts you are tagged in, make sure you enable the options to review tags people add to your posts before they appear on Facebook and on your timeline.\nThird-party access\nBy default, Facebook shares your personal information with websites you log into using your Facebook credentials. This isn't a bad thing to do, but to avoid exposing data to websites you don't use regularly, it's good practice to routinely manage apps with access to your Facebook account. Follow these instructions \u2014\nOn the app:\n- On the main page, tap your profile photo.\n- Hit the gear icon to get to \"Settings & privacy.\"\n- Scroll down to the \"Your information\" section.\n- Select \"Apps and websites.\"\nOn a computer:\n- Click on your profile photo in the top-right corner.\n- Pick \"Settings & privacy.\"\n- Select Settings.\n- Pick Apps and Websites from the sidebar.\nOn this page, choose the apps that you no longer use and remove them from the list. This effectively revokes access to your Facebook information.\nSimilarly, Facebook can glean information from apps and websites you access on your device, provided that they share your activity with the social media app. To review this data, head to \"Off-Facebook activity\" under the \"Your information\" section of the Facebook app's settings page. On a desktop, choose \"Your Facebook information\" from the side panel of the Settings page and hit View next to \"Off-Facebook activity.\"\nYou'll need to re-enter your Facebook password to clear your activity history or disconnect specific activities on various apps and websites. Clearing the history essentially disconnects all past activities from your account, so to be on the safe side, go through all the apps and individually turn some off, preferably those you find irrelevant to your actual interests.\nFacebook's sharing relationship with third-party businesses is meant to produce a more personalized experience on the platform. This ensures that every ad you run into on the app is relevant to your personal preferences.\nAd preferences and security settings\nUnfortunately, there is no way to completely turn off all ads on Facebook. Instead of that, you can rig your ad preferences so that you only see endorsements you want to see. Here's how to get there \u2014\nVia the mobile app:\n- Tap your profile photo and hit the gear icon.\n- If you can see Meta's Account Center on the \"Settings & privacy\" page, tap \"Ad preferences\" underneath it. Select \"Ad preferences\" again from the menu panel.\n- Otherwise, select Settings, scroll down to Permissions, and select \"Ad preferences.\"\nVia desktop:\n- Click your profile photo in the top-right corner.\n- Select \"Settings & privacy,\" then Settings.\n- If you see Meta's Account Center, click \"Ad preferences\" in that section and again from the \"Account settings\" panel.\n- If you don't, Select Ads from the left menu.\nWhile on this page, you can check out ads you've recently interacted with and view and modify your ad topics. You can also review \"Ad settings\" and decide if you want Facebook to use your Off-Facebook activity on partner websites to personalize what ads you see or not. Every section should have a brief explainer for what certain setting changes will do to the ads that show up on Facebook \u2014 carefully go through each one and disable items you prefer not to be used.\nLastly, it's highly recommended to regularly update your password, enable two-factor authentication, and enable login alerts so that you can deter hackers from taking control of your Facebook account. The quickest way to do all three is by using the Privacy Checkup tool within the \"Settings & privacy page\" and hitting \"How to keep your account secure.\" If you haven't enabled any of these features, Facebook will guide you through the process for each."

      "text": "5 Of The Most Popular Social Media Apps To Try Out In 2024\nGone are the days when being registered on social media was seen as a novelty. Stepping into 2024, these digital communities have become integral to everyone's lives. Beyond the conventional reasons like connecting, messaging, and sharing news or memes that people hop on social media apps for, there is a sea of opportunities for marketing prospects \u2014 especially among the most popular networking sites.\nWith more than half of the world's population enjoying the allure of social media platforms, these networks offer forums to people for advocacy and collaboration. From the endlessly scrolling entertainment on TikTok to the benefits of instant messaging through apps like WhatsApp and iMessage, there is a healthy variety among the top contenders.\nWhether you're a seasoned professional in the digital marketing space looking for your largest target audience or just someone excited to join a networking site with the biggest outreach to the masses, here is a list of the most populated social media apps to look out for in 2024 \u2014 ranked by the number of active users per month.\nMeta's quest for online dominance may not yet be at its peak, but with some of the world's most-used apps under its umbrella, it certainly is making significant strides toward that goal. Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook is now home to 3.3 billion active users worldwide, with its biggest market being in India.\nYou can find a multitude of use cases for utilizing Facebook, be it for selling or buying items through its marketplace, advertising your agency using a page, interacting in communities with other people, or even cross-sharing your uploads from Instagram. This social media giant also remains everyone's default when sharing milestones in their careers, education, or life in general.\nIt's no secret that the amount of data Meta loves to extract from its users is unforgivably astonishing; however, you can restrict the prying eyes by changing just a few Facebook privacy settings. Facebook's popularity is further expressed by the one billion people who use its dedicated texting app, Messenger.\nYouTube\nMost wouldn't see YouTube as a traditional social media platform. Still, with how many people it connects around the globe who share common interests, it ranks second with nearly 2.5 billion active users a month. The platform has become a hub for educational, entertainment, and promotional content due to nearly 500 hours worth of videos being uploaded to YouTube every passing minute.\nDespite the lack of image or GIF support, the comments sections on YouTube videos have some of the highest interaction among fellow viewers. The introduction of community posts has further streamlined communication between creators and their subscribers. YouTubers can also choose to craft special content for subscribers who have joined their paid membership tiers as well.\nIn classic Google fashion, YouTube doesn't shy away from playing around with experimental features. Although the recall of YouTube Stories was unfortunate, the launch of the TikTok-inspired Shorts feature was a massive success. YouTube also remains to be one of the most lucrative platforms for creators looking to monetize their work. In a digital era with shortened attention spans, YouTube persists as home to long-form and more immersive content.\nAt its core, WhatsApp allows users to send and receive text messages, place audio and video calls, and share images, GIFs, and other documents \u2014 all while connecting over 2 billion people worldwide. In certain countries like India, Malaysia, and South Africa, it is the dominant instant messaging app of choice. With privacy-focused features and the ability to enable end-to-end encrypted cloud backups, WhatsApp is a go-to for family and work-related communications.\nThe introduction of WhatsApp Business has enabled a slew of useful features and tools for small and medium-sized brands to take advantage of. With the recent addition of the linked devices feature, you can now use the same WhatsApp account on multiple devices \u2014 ranging from the web to Android and iPhones.\nGroup chats on WhatsApp benefit from message reactions, poll creation, private replies, and granular admin controls to avoid spam. WhatsApp Payments is another serviceable addition, featuring a quick way to send and receive funds, just like how you can on iMessage. Despite its limited popularity in the U.S., WhatsApp is a household name in most Asian and European countries.\nLaunched in 2010 as a mere photo-sharing platform with a handful of filter options, Instagram rose to unparalleled popularity among enthusiastic social media users. The billion-dollar acquisition by Facebook has catapulted Instagram into one of the most used digital platforms, amassing over 2 billion monthly users.\nAlthough not morally applaudable, Instagram's formula of borrowing features exclusive to other social media platforms worked in its favor. Instagram's version of stories, originally popularized by Snapchat, saw massive success and remains one of the most used features on the app to date. The implementation of reels, inspired by TikTok's short-form vertical content, has also become an integral part of the platform.\nThis is not to turn a blind eye to some of Instagram's unique features like broadcast groups, product-integrated posts, and powerful editing tools. The social network giant's algorithm is also impressive and highly adaptable to your interests. Messaging on Instagram through private DMs or groups is also a seamless experience with a bucketload of chat features, including polls, GIF support, disappearing photos and videos, and fancy message effects.\nRivaling TikTok for the fifth most popular social network, WeChat is a name most people might not be familiar with. Its lack of availability in most of the Western world is thanks to Tencent's history of privacy issues, leading to many countries, including the U.S., banning WeChat and its services. Its dominance in China, however, is the reason behind the 1.3 billion active users every month.\nPopular among all age groups, WeChat's usefulness extends beyond just being a messaging platform. It features a newsfeed similar to that of Facebook where users can share photos, videos, important life updates, or just connect with others. WeChat has a mini app store of its own, featuring add-ons like shopping, photo editing, and movie streaming apps.\nWeChat Pay, which is the company's digital wallet, is also acceptable throughout China and allows for quick and easy cashless transactions. The service is also available to registered users traveling to the U.K., Italy, South Africa, and other European countries."
