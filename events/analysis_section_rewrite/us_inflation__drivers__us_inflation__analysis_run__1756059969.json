      "feedback": "To lift this to world‑class quality, rewrite as a tight, source‑anchored, scenario‑driven synthesis that (a) crisply ties the Ford/ACMR cash‑flow anchors to macro/policy/flows/valuation, (b) lays out explicit near‑term catalysts and longer‑horizon risks, and (c) uses explicit numbers with clear sources and minimal hedges. Start with a single, crisp base thesis: Ford exemplifies a defensively tilted S&P 500 anchored in durable cash generation (Q2 EV losses ≈ $1.3B, adj. EBIT ≈ 4.3%, ROIC ≈ 10.1%, yield ≈ 5.2%, forward P/E ≈ 10.3) and ACMR’s 2025 revenue midpoint ≈ $900m with gross margin in the low single digits, all implying a cash‑flow‑driven profile (22PL3Q360)(65UUBU0OR). Then embed a three‑scenario frame with explicit triggers: Base/Regime A (inflation toward target, gradual policy easing, productivity‑led capex; tie to Ford’s auto cycle and EV economics; cite 37UZC9X8I)(NL5YYTLF2); Bear/Regime B (sticky inflation, wage cooling, tighter policy longer); Bull if EV platforms scale and EBITDA turns positive with ROIC meaningfully above cost of capital; specify triggers as inflation/wage prints, EV milestone completions, IEA oil‑supply revisions (J99EM2TPZ), and tariff/policy moves (RHXDOHQQX). Strengthen the causal chain by detailing how the macro regime → policy rate path → EV unit economics (and Ford’s Q2 dynamics) → equity multiples, with explicit linkages and a concise implications table, not vague statements. Involve numbers clearly: keep Ford/ACMR figures as anchors, present 2025 revenue and gross margin as ranges consistent with sources, and reproduce IEA’s 2.5 mbpd supply shift and tariff pause as explicit inputs (J99EM2TPZ)(RHXDOHQQX). Improve quantification by creating a minimal sensitivity outline: how a modest improvement in EV margins or ROIC vs. a sustained oil oversupply would shift fair value or P/E, without inventing numbers beyond the cited data. Reconcile conflicts by flagging when Regime A vs Regime B implications diverge (e.g., on pricing power and inflation trajectory) and cite both sides where relevant (37UZC9X8I)(NL5YYTLF2). Structure the piece with a clear watch‑list: inflation prints and wage trends; EV‑scale milestones; IEA supply revisions; tariff/news signals, with concrete thresholds and timing. Finally, ensure every factual assertion is backed by an ID from the source material and cover all critical sources (22PL3Q360)(65UUBU0OR)(37UZC9X8I)(NL5YYTLF2)(J99EM2TPZ)(RHXDOHQQX); avoid generic platitudes, and present a concise, forward‑looking conclusion plus a discrete set of decisive upcoming signals.",
