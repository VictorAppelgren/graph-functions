  "title": "What to know about the earthquake that shook the New York area Saturday night",
  "description": "A relatively mild 3.0 magnitude earthquake shook the New York metropolitan area Saturday night",
  "content": "Many posts on social media reported the ground rumbling, and the U.S. Geological Survey reported more than 10,000 responses to its \u2018Did You Feel It?\u2019 website.\n\nThough people in the United States might associate earthquakes more often with the West Coast, scientists say these types of incidents on the East Coast are not unlikely.\n\nHow frequent are earthquakes in the New York area?\n\nThe area feels an earthquake about once every couple of years.\n\n\u201cThe northeast part of the United States does not see large earthquakes very often,\u201d said Jessica Turner, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake Information Center, which is a part of the USGS.\n\nSince 1950, only 43 other quakes of this magnitude and larger have occurred within 155 miles (250 kilometers) of Saturday\u2019s event, according to the USGS.\n\nA much larger, 4.8-magnitude quake that struck in Tewksbury, New Jersey, a little farther west of the city, in April 2024 was felt as far away as Boston and Baltimore. Some flights were diverted or delayed after that quake, and Amtrak slowed trains throughout the busy Northeast corridor.\n\nA smaller, 1.7 magnitude earthquake that hit the Astoria section of Queens, New York, in January 2024 stirred residents.\n\nThe region sees a more damaging one only a couple times a century, if that. New York was damaged in 1737 and 1884 by earthquakes, according to USGS data.\n\nThe difference between East Coast and West Coast quakes lies in the \u201cmechanism,\u201d said seismologist Lucy Jones.\n\nCalifornia is at the edge of the San Andreas fault system, which has two tectonic plates: the Pacific Ocean plate and the North American plate. Two plates move and push to build up stress, meaning earthquakes happen relatively frequently.\n\nNew York falls in the middle of a plate, far from the nearest boundaries in the center of the Atlantic Ocean and in the Caribbean Sea \u2014 resulting in residual stresses and making it difficult to predict where earthquakes will occur.\n\nThe area is also home to the well-known Ramapo Fault line. Geologists have not seen evidence that would suggest it has had a large earthquake in some time, but there have been smaller ones. Saturday's quake cannot necessarily be associated with this fault, experts say.\n\nThe same size earthquake is felt over a much larger area in New York than it would be in California.\n\n\u201cThe rocks on the East Coast are particularly cold and hard and therefore, do a better job of transmitting the energy,\u201d said Jones. In California, the various faults are more akin to a broken bell, which doesn't transmit energy as well.\n\nEvery earthquake makes another one more likely, but within a range, scientists say.\n\n\u201cAt just 3.0, the chances are there will not be another felt event,\u201d Jones said, estimating about a 50-50 chance there will be no activity that can be recorded. \u201cMost likely is an unfelt, magnitude 1 or 2 aftershock.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press writers Julie Walker in New York City and Michael Hill in Altamont, New York, contributed.",

      "text": "US East Coast earthquake rattles millions, but region escapes sweeping damage\nUS East Coast earthquake rattles millions, but region escapes sweeping damage\nFollow live AP coverage of the earthquake that struck parts of the East Coast.\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 An unusual East Coast earthquake shook millions of people from New York and Philadelphia skyscrapers to rural New England on Friday, causing no widespread damage but startling an area unaccustomed to temblors.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey said over 42 million people might have felt the midmorning quake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.8, centered near Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, or about 45 miles (72 kilometers) west of New York City and 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Philadelphia.\nPeople from Baltimore to Boston and beyond felt the ground shake. Nearly 30 people were displaced when officials evacuated three multifamily homes in Newark, New Jersey, to check for damage. Officials around the region were inspecting bridges and other major infrastructure, some flights were diverted or delayed, Amtrak slowed trains throughout the busy Northeast Corridor, and a Philadelphia-area commuter rail line suspended service as a precaution.\nPictures and decorative plates tumbled off the wall in Christiann Thompson\u2019s house near Whitehouse Station, she said, relaying what her husband had told her by phone as she volunteered at a library.\n\u201cThe dogs lost their minds and got very terrified and ran around,\u201d she said.\nHere\u2019s what to know:\n- Epicenter in New Jersey: The USGS reported a quake at 10:23 a.m. with a preliminary magnitude of 4.8.\n- No damage or injuries: Authorities in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania said so far they had not received reports of life-threatening situations or damage to buildings.\n- Residents react: Earthquakes are less common on the East Coast, but they can still pack a punch \u2014 and leave people a \u201clittle freaked out,\u201d as one New Yorker described.\nWhitehouse Station Fire Chief Tim Apgar said no injuries were reported, but responders fielded some calls from people who smelled gas. Nearby, the upper portion of the 264-year-old Col. John Taylor\u2019s Grist Mill historic site collapsed onto a roadway, according to Readington Township Mayor Adam Mueller.\nIn a 26th-floor midtown Manhattan office, Shawn Clark felt the quake and initially feared an explosion or construction accident. It was \u201cpretty weird and scary,\u201d the attorney said.\nEarthquakes are less common on the eastern than western edges of the U.S. because the East Coast does not lie on a boundary of tectonic plates. But 13 earthquakes of magnitude 4.5 or stronger have been recorded since 1950 within 500 km (311 miles) of Friday\u2019s temblor, the USGS said. The strongest was a 5.8-magnitude quake in Mineral, Virginia, on Aug. 23, 2011, that jolted people from Georgia to Canada.\nRocks under the East Coast are better than their western counterparts at spreading earthquake energy across long distances, scientists note.\n\u201cIf we had the same magnitude quake in California, it probably wouldn\u2019t be felt nearly as far away,\u201d said USGS geophysicist Paul Caruso.\nOver a dozen aftershocks were reported in the ensuing hours in the region, including a 4.0-magnitude quake early Friday evening, according to the USGS.\nA 4.8-magnitude quake isn\u2019t large enough to cause damage, except for some minor effects near the epicenter, the agency posted on the social platform X. By comparison, the temblor that killed at least 12 people and injured more than 1,000 in Taiwan on Wednesday was variously measured at a magnitude of 7.2 or 7.4.\nStill, Friday\u2019s quake caused some disruption.\nFlights to the New York, Newark and Baltimore airports were held at their origins for a time while officials inspected runways for cracks. The Seton Hall University men\u2019s basketball team was delayed getting back to New Jersey from Indianapolis for a welcome-home celebration of the team\u2019s National Invitational Tournament win Thursday.\nAt least five flights en route to Newark were diverted and landed at Lehigh Valley International Airport in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where some passengers rented cars to get home.\nTraffic through the Holland Tunnel between Jersey City, New Jersey, and lower Manhattan was stopped for about 10 minutes for inspections, the Port Authority of New York and Jersey said.\nIn midtown Manhattan, motorists blared their horns on shuddering streets. Some Brooklyn residents heard a boom and felt their building shaking. Cellphone circuits were overloaded for a time as people tried to reach loved ones. Later, phones blared with earthquake-related notifications during the New York Philharmonic\u2019s morning performance, where Anton Webern\u2019s Six Pieces for Orchestra \u201cliterally ended with a cellphone alert,\u201d said spokesperson Adam Crane.\nAt U.N. headquarters in New York, the shaking interrupted Save The Children\u2019s chief executive, Janti Soeripto, as she briefed an emergency Security Council session on conditions in Gaza amid the Israel-Hamas war. In the Bronx, baseball\u2019s Yankees were taking batting practice ahead of their home opener against the Toronto Blue Jays when the quake struck. Manager Aaron Boone later said he \u201cthought it was the sound system booming.\u201d\nIn New York City\u2019s Astoria neighborhood, Cassondra Kurtz was giving her 14-year-old Chihuahua, Chiki, a cocoa-butter rubdown for her dry skin. Kurtz was recording the moment on video when her apartment started shaking hard enough that a large mirror banged audibly against a wall.\nThe video captured Kurtz looking around, perplexed. Chiki, however, \u201cwas completely unbothered.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s quake was felt as far as Maine, where \u201cit felt like the floor was almost doing the wave\u201d in Meghan Hebert\u2019s South Portland apartment. Some Vermont and New Hampshire residents initially figured it was snow falling off their roofs or plow trucks rumbling by. In Hartford, Connecticut, paralegal Stacy Santa Cruz watched her computer screen shake.\nPhiladelphia high school student Ian Ventura took the quake as a sign of ominous times, coming between the Taiwan temblor and Monday\u2019s total solar eclipse in North America.\nScared for the world\u2019s future, \u201cI might take some risks, text this one girl,\u201d said Ventura, 16. \u201cI got the message typed out. I might send it.\u201d\nPresident Joe Biden said he spoke to New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy about the earthquake. The White House said the administration would provide help if needed.\nNew York City had no indications of major safety or infrastructure problems from the earthquake, Mayor Eric Adams said. City Buildings Commissioner James Oddo said officials would watch for any delayed cracks or other effects on the Big Apple\u2019s 1.1 million buildings.\nEngineers said New York\u2019s skyscrapers are made of high-strength materials and designed to sway slowly to withstand winds and other impacts. Modern high rises also have other features to help absorb any shock.\n\u201cHigh-rise buildings can be one of the safest places you can be in an earthquake,\u201d said Ahmad Rahimian of the engineering firm WSP Global.\nMeanwhile, even the delicately placed eggs that form part of a sculpture at a Chinatown art gallery stayed in place during Friday\u2019s quake, to the relief of gallerist Kristen Thomas.\n___\nCatalini reported from Whitehouse Station, New Jersey.

Follow AP for full coverage.\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A 1.7 magnitude earthquake that hit New York City early Tuesday may have caused a series of small explosions on an island between Manhattan and Queens, officials said.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey reported that the quake occurred at 5:45 a.m. near the Astoria section of Queens. There were no reports of injuries or structural damage and no impacts to transit, traffic or utility services, New York City Office of Emergency Management spokesperson Aries Dela Cruz said.\nSome residents of Manhattan and Queens reported what sounded like small explosions shortly before 6 a.m. coming from Roosevelt Island, a 2-mile (3.2-kilometer)-long strip of land in the East River between the two boroughs.\nAllan Drury, a spokesperson for Consolidated Edison, said officials at the utility suspect that the quake caused the explosions, since they happened around the same time.\nDrury said there were no power outages.\nThe New York City earthquake happened a few hours after a 2.3 magnitude quake was reported in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. No injuries or damage were reported following the earlier quake either."
