  "content": "With forecasters predicting temperatures to surge above 30C in many parts of England this week, gardeners are being urged to take simple steps to help protect hedgehogs and other vulnerable wildlife from the intensifying heatwave. According to the Met Office, a combination of high pressure and warm southerly winds is driving a sharp rise in temperatures across England and Wales, with peak conditions expected midweek. London could see highs in the mid-30s by Tuesday, while much of central and southern England is expected to meet official heatwave criteria by Wednesday, according to the meteorological service. The UK Health Security Agency has issued Yellow and Amber Heat Health Alerts for parts of England, warning of potential impacts on health services, particularly affecting the elderly, young children, and those with underlying health conditions. However, it\u2019s not just people who are vulnerable in extreme heat, wildlife is at risk too.\n\nJames Lewis, an expert from MyBuilder.com told The Moorlander: \"While our gardens can be a real haven for hedgehogs, certain elements can represent a danger at this time of year. \"Ponds, paddling pools, and even drains can cause serious harm or even death to hedgehogs, so it\u2019s essential that these are adequately made safe. \"Simple steps in your garden can take away any risk, and in fact provide important elements to keep our wildlife healthy in the heat.\" Experts from MyBuilder.com recommend making ponds and paddling pools safe with ramps or covers, providing shaded shelter like log piles or hedgehog houses, and avoiding disturbance to nests and hoglets.\n\nGardeners are also advised to leave areas of their garden wild to offer natural food and cover, check compost heaps before turning them, leave out water and wet food, and cover drains to prevent entrapment. Often seen as a regular visitor of British gardens, hedgehogs are quietly disappearing. Once common across both rural and urban landscapes, they are now in serious trouble. Hedgehogs are officially listed as \"Vulnerable to Extinction\" on Britain\u2019s Red List of Mammals. The 2022 State of Britain\u2019s Hedgehogs report estimates that hedgehog numbers have decreased by up to 75% in rural areas since the turn of the century. Urban populations have also declined, though at a slower rate, with losses of up to 30% reported. Habitat loss, traffic, the widespread of pesticides, climate extremes like heatwaves, and increasingly hostile garden environments are among the leading causes of the species' decline.",

      "text": "With Devon braced for another scorching day tomorrow, with temperatures forecast to exceed 30\u00b0C, wildlife experts are warning that the heatwave poses a serious threat to one of Britain\u2019s most beloved animals: the hedgehog.\nHedgehog numbers have plummeted by 75% in the past 20 years, leaving the species officially endangered. The ongoing hot, dry summer is adding extra pressure, as food and water sources become scarce and dangerous garden features pose new risks.\nAs part of their Trades to the Rescue campaign, MyBuilder.com is rallying gardeners and tradespeople to take simple steps to protect hedgehogs during the heatwave.\nJames Lewis, an expert from MyBuilder.com, said:\n\u201cWhile our gardens can be a real haven for hedgehogs, certain elements can represent a danger at this time of year.\n\u201cPonds, paddling pools, and even drains can cause serious harm or even death to hedgehogs, so it\u2019s essential that these are adequately made safe. Simple steps in your garden can take away any risk, and in fact provide important elements to keep our wildlife healthy in the heat.\n\u201cIf you have any concerns about how to keep hedgehogs \u2014 and wildlife in general \u2014 safe in your summer garden, ask a local gardener to take a look at your outdoor areas and make recommendations. Most are easily done, and will make a big difference to your local hedgehogs.\u201d\nSharon Jacobs, Head Nurse at Tiggywinkles Wildlife Hospital, added:\n\u201cDuring the summer heatwaves, it\u2019s vital to remember that hedgehogs are not only struggling with the high temperatures themselves, but many are also caring for tiny babies. Leaving out shallow dishes of water and checking long grass or under shrubs before gardening so that you don\u2019t inadvertently disturb a nest can make all the difference. A small act of kindness can save a whole family of hedgehogs.\u201d\nThe advice from MyBuilder\u2019s experts includes:\nMake ponds and paddling pools safe with ramps or covers.\nProvide shade and shelter, such as log piles or hedgehog houses in cool spots.\nWatch for hoglets and avoid disturbing nests.\nLeave wild areas in gardens to provide food and cover.\nCheck compost heaps before turning them.\nLeave out water and wet food like tinned cat or dog food.\nCover drains to prevent entrapment.\nWith tomorrow set to bring one of the hottest days of the year, campaigners say now is the time to act.\nFull advice is available at: www.mybuilder.com/blog/help-for-hedgehogs\nSubscribe or register today to discover more from DonegalLive.ie\nBuy the e-paper of the Donegal Democrat, Donegal People's Press, Donegal Post and Inish Times here for instant access to Donegal's premier news titles.\nKeep up with the latest news from Donegal with our daily newsletter featuring the most important stories of the day delivered to your inbox every evening at 5pm."
