  "title": "The iPhone 18's A20 chip again reported to use next-gen RAM integration process",
  "description": "Putting RAM on the same die as the other chip components should improve performance and power efficiency.",
  "content": "Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has echoed other reports that Apple is expected to use a new chip packaging technology in the A20 chip, which will debut in the iPhone 18 next year. His report focuses on suppliers for chip packaging materials, rather than the benefits of the new process. We heard the same from analyst Jeff Pu a couple months ago.\n\nWhen you buy an iPhone 16 today, the A19 chip inside is a pretty big and complex monolithic \u201csystem on a chip.\u201d It\u2019s got the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, video and audio encoders and decoders, and a bunch of other little stuff all on one big complex piece of silicon with around 30 billion transistors. Many chips are made on a big silicon disk (called a wafer) and then packaged up and cut into individual A19 chips, called \u201cdies.\u201d\n\nBut the RAM is not on the same piece of silicon. RAM is typically manufactured using different silicon processes, on different big wafers, cut into their own dies. Then the RAM is combined with the big SoC by connecting the two together using another piece of silicon, called an interposer.\n\nThis is done because the manufacturing processes that produces SRAM efficiently is different than what produces logic efficiently. But with a new TSMC technology called \u201cWafer-Level Multi-Chip Module (WMCM) packaging,\u201d that might all change.\n\nThis process will make it possible for Apple to build a big monolithic chip that includes the RAM on the same die as the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, media encoders, and so on. If the current rumors are correct, this would be 12GB of RAM, but the process doesn\u2019t require any specific amount. Rumors point to the iPhone 18 as the first device to use the new chip, and the iPhone Fold could also be a candidate.\n\nOn-die RAM may simplify the manufacturing process, requiring fewer steps than the current RAM-on-interposer setup. But the benefit for users is the potential to have very wide and fast RAM interfaces, making access to RAM almost as fast as a high-level SRAM cache. This could drastically improve performance in situations that are limited by memory bandwidth, such as high-performance 3D graphics or certain AI applications.\n\nIt could also allow for better power management, allowing the SoC with integrated RAM to use less power than the current setup with RAM attached on an interposer. This may improve battery life, but battery life is a factor of many different components like the display, wireless radios, storage, and more.",

      "text": "While you\u2019re trying to figure out if you\u2019re going to invest in a new iPhone 17 this fall, we always like to remind YOU that something better is always coming soon. The latest report from the future comes from analyst Jeff Pu of GF Securities, who provides insight on the A20 chip that will be used in the iPhone 18 next year.\nTSMC, Apple\u2019s chip manufacturer, is using an enhanced 3nm process for the A19 chip in this year\u2019s iPhone 17, according to several reports. Reports say this will be the last chip to use the 3nm process, as TSMC will move to 2nm for the A20 in the iPhone 18 Pro and the rumored folding iPhone. According to Pu, TSMC will make the A20 using Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module (WMCM) packaging, where the components of the chip are integrated into the chip at the wafer level. This would allow for, say, the A20\u2019s RAM to be integrated with the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, and other wafer-level components. This is different from the current method of using a silicon interposer to connect the RAM.\nWith the RAM closer to the CPU and other chip components, this could result in improved power efficiency and a decrease in running temperature, which could provide benefits for battery life. It could also make the physical size of the A20 smaller, which again, would help with power efficiency, and could also benefit the overall design of the iPhone 18\u2013especially the folding iPhone, which will consist of two thin sides that fold into a thicker one.\nPu reports said that the 2nm process involves switching from fin field-effect transistors (FinFET) to gate-all-around field-effect transistors (GAAFET). The switch should allow for an improvement in performance with better power efficiency, but it\u2019s unclear if the effect on power efficiency would be even greater because of the WMCM packaging.\nThe nanometer process refers to the production of the chip, and 2nm allows for increased transistor density over the previous 3nm and 5nm processes. The higher the transistor density, the better the performance, and the process can also result in better power efficiency. Apple\u2019s first 3nm was the A17 Pro, which debuted in the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max."

      "text": "With the iPhone 16, Apple increased the amount of RAM to 8GB so it can properly run upcoming Apple Intelligence features. And further RAM increases could be on the cards as Apple Intelligence evolves, if the latest report about a future iPhone is any indication.\nAccording to a report on Weibo by \u201cMobile phone chip expert,\u201d the iPhone 18 will feature a new A20 chip that includes 12GB of RAM:\nThe 2nm processor A20 of the 2026 Apple iPhone will adopt a new packaging method. APTS has been changed from the original InFo to the WMCM packaging method. Memory will also be upgraded to 12GB, and the whole network will be announced 2 years in advance.\nThe person behind \u201cMobile chip expert\u201d states in their Weibo profile that they have 25 years in the integrated chip industry. That person has also made accurate predictions in the past. \u201cMobile chip expert\u201d also reported in August that the iPhone 17 will have 12GB of RAM, a reported echoed by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\nWhile Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t officially available yet, it\u2019s already had an effect on the company\u2019s products. For the feature to work the way Apple wants it to work, the iPhone, iPad, and Mac need more RAM, a component the company has been stingy with historically. But with the new iPhone 16, Apple increased the amount of RAM in the device, and is rumored to do the same with the upcoming base M4 MacBook Pro.\nAI features like Apple Intelligence are processor-intensive, so having enough RAM is important for an optimal experience. As Apple Intelligence evolves, it could become more demanding of the processor, which could explain why Apple is set to increase RAM in future devices.\nThe report also mentions that the A20 chip in the iPhone 18 will be manufactured using an enhanced 2nm process. This falls in line with a report from the beginning of this year that said that Apple was looking into the 2nm process for its iPhone 17 in 2025.\nThe nanometer process refers to the production of the chip, and 2nm allows for increased transistor density over the current 3nm used for the A18 and A18 Pro in the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro respectively. The higher the transistor density, the better the performance and power efficiency. The enhanced 2nm process for the A20 chip in 2026 would introduce improvements from the standard 2nm process."

      "text": "We\u2019ve been reporting on the rumored \u201ccoming soon\u201d launch of a foldable iPhone for years. There have been strong and reliable rumors of a foldable iPhone being just two years away dating as far back as 2018, at least. Back then, reliable reports from the likes of CNBC said Apple was going to have a folding iPhone on the market in 2020.\nThat became 2021, 2022, 2024, 2025\u2026 and now it\u2019s scheduled to land in 2026 at the earliest.\nSo, while the rumors and reports from parts suppliers and analysts are heating up and seem to be more solid than ever, we would advise even more caution and skepticism than usual with Apple rumors. Having said that, here\u2019s what the current rumors suggest about the release of a folding iPhone.\nUpdate July 23, 2025: A report reiterates previous reports regarding the folding iPhone\u2019s display size.\nFolding iPhone: Release date\nAccording to a series of reports, the major design and specs of Apple\u2019s first folding phone are due to be finalized in the middle of 2025, with production targeted for late 2026. That would mean a launch late in 2026 or early 2027. So far, this timeline has been suggested by several sources in 2024 and 2025, including The Information, The Wall Street Journal, and analysts Ming-Chi Kuo and Mark Gurman.\nThe phone is expected to be complex and expensive to manufacture, so production volume will likely be very limited at first. A second model in late 2027 should see higher production numbers.\nGurman reported in July 2025 that Apple will focus on features for the folding iPhone in iOS 27, which will be released in the fall of 2026.\nFolding iPhone: Design\nIn 2024, The Information reported that Apple had made a couple of prototype \u201cclamshell\u201d flip-phone designs, where the top and bottom of the phone fold to meet. More recent rumors in 2025 from Digital Chat Station on Weibo and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggest a \u201cbook\u201d style fold, with a vertical fold as the left and right sides fold to meet each other. This is a similar style to the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold.\nLuke Baker\nThe hinge is expected to be one of its most unique features. Some reports have suggested it will be made of a titanium alloy, while Kup reported in March 2025 that Apple is exploring the use of LiquidMetal for \u201cdurability, enhancing screen flatness, and minimizing crease marks\u201d in the screen. Apple has received several patents for hinge designs, and it\u2019s unclear which the company will use in the final design.\nOn July 14, analyst Ming-Chi Ku reported that Apple figured out how to get rid of the fold crease by using metal plates to help \u201cdistribute and control bending stress,\u201d according to Kuo, which would help minimize creasing.\nFolding iPhone: Size and dimensions\nAnalyst Ming-Chi Kuo has reported on the folding iPhone\u2019s set of proposed design details. He says the book-style iPhone will have a 7.8-inch inside display when unfolded, and a 5.5-inch outer display. Kuo says Apple won\u2019t be satisfied until the phone\u2019s display is completely crease-free when opened.\nIn July, TrendForce reported that the folding iPhone would feature a 5.5-inch external display and a 7.8-inch internal display.\nThe folding phone is said to be at most 9.5mm thick when folded and 4.5mm when unfolded. For comparison, an iPhone 16 Pro Max is 8.5mm thick, and the thinnest iPhone of all time was the iPhone 6 at 6.9mm. The upcoming iPhone 17 Air is expected to be around 6mm thick and possibly as thin as 5.5mm.\nFolding iPhone: Specs and features\nWe don\u2019t know what processor the folding iPhone will contain, but if it launches in 2026 as rumored, it will probably feature an A20 or A20 Pro\u2014some variant of the processor found in the iPhone 18.\nWe expect most iPhones to use Apple\u2019s own cellular modem and Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chips by that time as well. They may even be integrated into the main system-on-chip.\nIDG\nDue to the very thin nature of the foldable iPhone, and the need for different front-facing cameras when folded up or unfolded, it will reportedly lack Face ID. Instead, Touch ID will be incorporated into the side button much as it is on the iPad Air and mini.\nThere will reportedly be two rear cameras (likely a standard wide and ultrawide) and two front-facing cameras, one for when the iPhone is folded closed and one for when it\u2019s open.\nBloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman reported in July 2025 that Apple will focus on features for the folding iPhone in iOS 27, which will be released in the fall of 2026.\nFolding iPhone: Price\nExpect the folding iPhone to be a very high-end, ultra-premium model. The very first release is said to cost $2,000 or more and could start at $2,299, twice the highest-end iPhone Pro Max."
