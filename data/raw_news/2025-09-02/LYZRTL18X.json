  "title": "Turkey And Israel\u2019s Drones Are Selling Like Hot Cakes In Asia",
  "description": "Japan recently tested the Heron-2 surveillance drone made by Israel Aerospace Industries before going on to test Turkey\u2019s widely-exported Bayraktar TB2 combat drone.",
  "content": "Japan is presently assessing whether to buy military drones from either Turkey or Israel. The fact that Tokyo decided to choose between these two Middle Eastern powers rather than the United States or Europe is hardly surprising. After all, in recent years, several countries across Asia have acquired or shown an interest in acquiring drones developed by these two countries.\n\nJapan recently tested the Heron Mk2 surveillance drone made by Israel Aerospace Industries before going on to test Turkey\u2019s widely-exported Bayraktar TB2 combat drone, a Japanese military spokesperson confirmed to Jane\u2019s on August 21.\n\nThe Jerusalem Post noted that Tokyo\u2019s evaluation of the Israeli drone marked \u201cthe first documented instance of an Israeli weapon system being tested in Japan,\u201d which had \u201crefrained from purchasing Israeli platforms until now.\u201d\n\nWhile Turkey\u2019s TB2 primarily serves as an unmanned combat aerial vehicle armed with air-to-ground munitions, the Heron drones primarily serve as surveillance and reconnaissance drones. The Post report also noted that the Heron Japan tested is configured for electronic warfare.\n\nIsrael previously sold three Heron drones to South Korea in the 2010s. However, all three have been destroyed in separate accidents, the latest of which occurred on March 17, 2025, when a Heron Mk1 crashed into a helicopter while landing, totaling both aircraft but luckily not causing any casualties.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps noteworthy that Japan is evaluating Turkey\u2019s TB2. After all, back in March 2022, Haluk Bayraktar, CEO of the TB2\u2019s manufacturer Baykar, suggested that the TB3, the navalized version of the TB2 fitted with folding wings, would \u201cbe a great fit for Japan\u2019s Izumo-class platforms.\u201d\n\nTurkey developed the TB3 to operate off its amphibious assault ship TCG Anadolu, from which it will begin operations this September, only weeks after Japan evaluated the more popular land-based variant.\n\nEven if Israel\u2019s IAI clinches a deal for selling Heron Mk2s to Japan at the expense of Baykar\u2019s TB2, Turkey still has a clear lead when it comes to the number of drones it is exporting to various Asian countries.\n\nStill, Israel has had some success marketing its drones to Asia, particularly its surveillance and reconnaissance models.\n\nFor example, Thailand\u2019s navy has acquired Israel\u2019s Hermes 450 and Hermes 900 long-endurance drones in recent years. Manufacturer Elbit Systems stated that its drones \u201cenable the Royal Thai Navy to perform both blue water and littoral missions, dominate vast swathes of sea and long coastlines, communicate with operational vessels and carry out civilian missions.\u201d\n\nBangkok also bought lightweight Orbiter and large Dominator reconnaissance drones, both built by Aeronautics Defense Systems, in the late 2010s.\n\nThe Philippines also received three Hermes 900 and one Hermes 450 for its air force in 2020 and lost one to an accident two years later. Singapore also operates Hermes 450 and Heron drones.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkey has made headway selling drones, along with other weaponry, to Indonesia and Malaysia, neither of which has diplomatic relations with Israel.\n\nMalaysia recently ordered three of Turkey\u2019s large multirole Anka-S drones, built by the state-run Turkish Aerospace Industries, primarily for monitoring its exclusive economic zone, a similar role to those Israeli-made drones operated by the Philippines and Thailand. Kuala Lumpur expects to receive all three between September and November 2025.\n\nSince the start of the 2020s, Turkey has sold at least a dozen Anka and another dozen TB2 drones to Indonesia. But the most significant order as of yet is undoubtedly the joint production agreement signed between Baykar and Indonesia\u2019s Republikorp in February 2025. Under that landmark deal, Indonesia will acquire a whopping 60 TB3s and nine of Baykar\u2019s sophisticated, multirole Akinci high-altitude long-endurance drones.\n\nNone of the countries that Israel and Turkey are selling, or competing to sell, drones to, mentioned so far, are at war with each other, nor are any likely to be any time soon. Israeli-made reconnaissance drones have played a role in the recent border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia in the service of the former. Of course, Cambodia doesn\u2019t have any Turkish-made drones.\n\nThat stands in contrast with the Russia-Ukraine war, where it quickly became noticeable that rival Middle Eastern powers, Iran and Turkey, were supplying armed drones to the two adversaries in Europe\u2019s largest war since the 1940s.\n\nTurkey\u2019s TB2s became adulated in Ukraine for striking Russian tanks advancing on Kyiv at the start of that war in early 2022. Later that year, Iranian-made one-way Shahed-136 loitering munitions operated by Russia began targeting Ukrainian cities and the electricity grid. Iran has since outsourced the production of its Shahed-type drones to the extent that Russia is now producing tailor-made variants with minimal Iranian input, reportedly much to Tehran\u2019s chagrin.\n\nNotably absent from Middle Eastern powers exporting drones to Asia is Iran. Tehran has exported drones across the Middle East, Africa, and South America, but hasn\u2019t had similar success in much of Asia. Interestingly, North Korea could soon have its own production line for Shahed-style drones, albeit one provided by Moscow rather than Tehran.\n\nLate Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and other Iranian officials boasted in 2022 that countries worldwide were clamoring for Iranian-made drones. As evident at the time, Iran was unlikely to match Turkey\u2019s success in exporting military drones to a wide range of countries. Iran has also failed to give its arch-foe Israel any significant competition in Asia, but, interestingly, it seemingly has to some mild degree done so in South America.\n\nLess than two years after Raisi\u2019s boast, it was a Turkish Akinci drone that helped find the crashed helicopter that killed him.\n\nWhile wars involving Israeli and Turkish-made drones used against each other haven\u2019t taken place in the Asian countries mentioned above, that\u2019s not the case regarding India and Pakistan.\n\nNot wholly unlike the case with Russia-Ukraine, the brief but intense four-day conflict between India and Pakistan in early May 2025 saw two heavily armed militaries equipped with Israeli and Turkish-made drones fight each other.\n\nIsrael has collaborated militarily with India for decades now and supplied it with significant numbers of drones, including substantial quantities of all the surveillance models\u2014Hermes, Herons, and Searchers\u2014mentioned above, and the one-way Harop loitering munitions. New Delhi used these latter drones against radar units in Pakistan.\n\nTurkey has supplied Pakistan with the Bayraktar TB2 and Akinci drones. Incidentally, Ankara has also sold TB2 drones to Bangladesh, which reportedly use them to surveil its border with India.\n\nThe war has since been described as the \u201cworld\u2019s first drone war between nuclear-armed neighbors,\u201d with several of those drones sold by Turkey and Israel.\n\nIt therefore shouldn\u2019t surprise anybody if Turkey and Israel continue to play a significant role in the proliferation of drones in Asia.",

      "text": "The South American country Bolivia has expressed interest in acquiring drone technology from Iran in the latest sign that more countries on the continent are interested in acquiring military drones.\nBolivian Defense Minister Edmundo Novillo confirmed his country\u2019s interest following a demand for information on the matter from neighboring Argentina. Novillo said Bolivia requires Iranian drones to monitor its border regions and provide real-time footage to its armed forces.\nArgentina has also shown an interest in drones manufactured in the Middle East. On Dec. 27, 2022, it signed a contract for Hero-120 and Hero-30 loitering munitions (single-use, explosive drones) built by Uvision in Israel, making it the first Latin American country to purchase this series of drones.\nIran is also heavily involved in Venezuela's drone program, with analysis suggesting it has outsourced the production of loitering munitions, similar to the Shahed series infamously used by Russia against Ukraine, to that South American country.\nIn 2012, then-Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez confirmed his country was building drones as part of its military cooperation with Iran. However, he stressed those drones only carried cameras and were strictly for self-defense, suggesting they were surveillance drones.\nIran has supplied Mohajer single-engine tactical drones to Venezuela. In February 2022, Israel accused Iran of transferring precision-guided munitions to Venezuela for these drones.\nIn October 2022, Iranian Major General Yahya Safavi claimed, \"22 world countries are demanding to purchase unmanned aircraft from Iran.\" Venezuela was one of the countries he mentioned.\nWhile Iran and Israel seem poised to export more drones to South America, the market for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in that region is relatively small. Turkey repeatedly made headlines in recent years for exporting its Bayraktar TB2 drone to 30 countries. Nevertheless, none of those countries were in South America.\nThere has also been a notable uptick in the number of drones imported by African countries. Ethiopia, for example, acquired drones from China, Iran, and Turkey. Israel has also sold drones to Morocco since the 2020 Abraham Accords.\nSouth America may soon follow suit by seeking more drones from eager exporters.\n\"Bolivia's interest in Iranian drone technologies indicates that we are in the early stages of military drone proliferation across the continent,\" James Patton Rogers of the Cornell Tech Policy Institute told me.\n\"This is fueled by rivals and competing exporters, like Iran and Israel, but also competing ideological and geopolitical interests that divide the continent,\" he said.\nArgentina and Bolivia share a border. Consequently, their separate procurements of drones from Iran and Israel is arousing suspicions and tensions.\n\"These drones usually come with operatives from the supplying state to aid in training and maintenance, and it is still unclear who has access to the intelligence data gathered by these drones,\" Rogers said. \"Such concerns are likely to heighten security tensions in the region, and so transparency in the capabilities and intent of these drones is key to ensure regional stability.\"\nCheap drones of the kind Iran builds large numbers of are also attractive to South American buyers, many of which have limited funds.\n\"Since many countries in South America do not have large military budgets, they may opt to procure UAVs they think can best fit their requirements, such as relatively low costs and significant combat potential,\" Samuel Bendett, a research analyst with the Center for Naval Analyses, told me.\n\"Iranian drones like Shahed fit that category, and Iran has indicated there are many countries interested in acquiring their UAVs,\" he said. \"Therefore, it's not surprising that Bolivia may be next in line after Venezuela, Ethiopia, Tajikistan, and possibly Armenia to get Iranian drones.\"\nSouth American countries may also manufacture drones.\n\"South America countries have the potential to produce military drones of their own and locally manufacture foreign designs, which could also fuel regional proliferation,\" Rogers said, citing Venezuela as a key example.\nBendett also believes it is \"likely\" these countries will manufacture drones.\n\"Certainly, when it comes to dual-use light ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) drones for law enforcement and border patrol, there are multiple state, non-state, academic, and private sector efforts around the world already doing just that,\" he said.\n\"The expertise, knowledge, and components needed to construct such drones are readily available.\"\nBoth Bendett and Rogers believe the ongoing Ukraine war played a significant role in the global proliferation of drones.\n\"Many drone types used in Ukraine are of interest to many countries around the world - Ukrainian, American, Turkish, Russian, and Iranian designs,\" Bendett said.\nRogers noted that the Russian war on Ukraine has \"fueled\" this worldwide interest in various drone types.\n\"The war has been a shop window for Iran and Turkey (amongst others), showing the world what their weapons can do,\" he said. \"Indeed, drones have been used to target energy infrastructure, troops on the battlefield, and civilian centers.\"\n\"With this in mind, the longer-term worry should be that as drones spread, the disturbing practices of use set in Ukraine will follow them,\" he added.\nRogers fears the \"uncontrolled proliferation\" of military drones, which, he argued to the U.N. Security Council in August, poses an increasing \"transnational threat\" to the security of an increasing number of countries worldwide.\n\"Today, 113 nations have access to military drone technologies, and my worry is that South America could end up resembling parts of Africa or Europe by the end of the decade: with leading drone producers like Turkey, China, the U.S., or even Russia vying for a share of an emergent market,\" he said.\n\"We need only look at Argentina's acquisition of Israeli 'Hero' loitering munitions as a key example of the spread of armed military drones in the region.\"\nBendett also foresees increasing drone proliferation in South America, noting that a number of countries are already selling to the region and that \"Russia is seeking to enter this market as well.\"\n\"And it's likely that other drone developers may follow,\" he said."

      "text": "In the space of a mere two years, Indonesia and Malaysia have both become noticeable importers of Turkey\u2019s indigenous weapons systems, ordering advanced drones, anti-ship missiles, and even warships.\nMarking Indonesia\u2019s 79th Independence Day on Aug. 17, Turkish Defense Minister Yaser Guler expressed Ankara\u2019s \u201chope to increase the number of joint training and exercises conducted by our armed forces.\u201d\n\u201cOur main goal is to elevate our friendship and cooperation to a much stronger level in every field,\u201d he said.\nThe Indonesian Air Force chief of staff met the Turkish Air Force commander in Ankara on July 1 to discuss collaboration on strengthening air defenses, among other things. In the preceding days, the Indonesian official visited facilities belonging to Baykar Technology, manufacturer of Turkey\u2019s widely exported Bayraktar TB2 drone, and saw a flight demonstration of the company\u2019s advanced Akinci unmanned combat aerial vehicle.\nDefense ties between Turkey and Indonesia are undoubtedly burgeoning, with several orders made in the last two years alone.\nThe Indonesian Navy is interested in acquiring Bayraktar Akinci and Anka UCAVs, made by the state-owned Turkish Aerospace Industries, as part of an initiative announced in June. Baykar and TAI are also prepared to collaborate with Indonesia\u2019s Dirgantara Indonesia aerospace firm.\nJakarta already ordered 12 Anka drones for its army, air force, and navy as part of a $300 million deal with TAI in 2023, expecting full delivery before November 2025.\nIndonesia views Turkish systems as suitable for surveilling and defending its vast maritime borders. For example, the country\u2019s defense ministry proposed arming its upcoming Red White frigates with Turkish missiles in June, revising a previous plan to import weapons from different suppliers for these warships.\nThe move comes after Indonesia decided to buy 45 indigenously developed Turkish Atmaca anti-ship guided missiles, making Jakarta the first export customer for that Turkish surface-to-surface missile. Turkey is building the Atmaca to replace its American-built AGM-84 Harpoons.\nThe land-based version of the missile, the Kara Atmaca, completed its longest-range flight test on Sunday, hitting a floating target with \u201cpinpoint accuracy.\u201d That missile has a purported range of 173 miles and a slightly heavier warhead than the naval version.\nThe Atmaca isn\u2019t the only Turkish-developed missile Indonesia has become the first country to buy. Turkey\u2019s missile manufacturer Roketsan signed a contract with Indonesia in November 2022 to supply the Khan short-range ballistic missile, the export version of Turkey\u2019s Bora-1 SRBM, which will make Jakarta the first foreign operator of the Turkish SRBM.\nIndonesia signed that contract alongside another contract for Turkey to develop a layered air defense system. There are fewer details publicly available about this latter contract. The July 1 meeting between the Indonesian Air Force chief of staff and the Turkish Air Force commander on air defense collaboration mentioned above most likely included discussions on this contract\u2019s progress. Incidentally, Turkey announced its Steel Dome integrated multilayered national air defense system early this August, which will primarily, if not entirely, consist of indigenous surface-to-air missiles.\nThroughout this same general period, Turkey has also inked some notable defense contracts with Indonesia\u2019s western neighbor, Malaysia.\nDefense Minister Guler visited Malaysia on Monday and met his Malaysian counterpart and the country\u2019s prime minister. They unsurprisingly discussed bilateral defense cooperation.\nMalaysia signed a contract in June for building three littoral mission ships for the Royal Malaysian Navy in Turkey. The contract \u201cmarks the first time Malaysia has signed a government-to-government agreement to procure defense equipment,\u201d according to Defense News.\nTurkey expects to begin building the warships this year and deliver them in under four years. The vessels will come equipped with Turkish sensors and Atmaca missiles.\nMalaysia\u2019s Dayatech Merin company also proposed acquiring Turkish Kuzgun anti-ship missiles for Malaysian navy corvettes and missile boats during the DSA 2024 defense exhibition in Kuala Lumpur in May.\nMalaysia announced in May 2023 that it had signed a contract with TAI for three Anka drones to support air force and police operations as part of a contract valued at $91.6 million. A representative of Malaysia\u2019s air force at DSA 2024 told Naval News that the production of drones and the training of Malaysian personnel to operate them are still on schedule a year later.\nWith so many projects underway, it\u2019s clear that by the end of this decade, the armed forces of Indonesia and Malaysia will most likely have various Turkish-built systems deployed for surveilling and defending their respective airspaces and territorial waters."

      "text": "Recent comments from top Iranian officials strongly suggest that Tehran perceives itself as a rapidly ascending arms exporter, especially of drones. In reality, Iran, at least under the incumbent regime in Tehran, will not likely prove capable of replicating Turkey's impressive success in exporting its well-known homegrown Bayraktar TB2 drone to numerous countries worldwide in just a few short years. Iran will have to settle for a much more limited market consisting of other pariah states and cash-strapped countries with little to no viable alternatives.\nIn a televised address on Oct. 22, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi claimed that foreign leaders frequently inquire about Iran's indigenous military equipment when he travels abroad.\n\"Until recently, our military industry did not even have barbed wire, and they would not give it to us,\" he said. \"Today, in New York, in Samarkand, when I meet with heads of state, they ask me: 'You don't want to sell us the products of your military industries?'\"\nRaisi claimed he would respond to such questions by asking why those countries want Iranian hardware all of a sudden, to which they invariably reply: \"Your industry is more advanced. It is different from the rest of the world.\"\nOn Aug. 22, the aerospace commander of Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) paramilitary also used the barbed wire analogy to illustrate how far Iran's arms industry has come.\n\"In the military field, we did not have the capabilities that we have now,\" said Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh. \"In the past, we used to import even barbed wire, but now we export drones.\"\nAnd on Oct. 18, Iranian Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi emphasized Iran's success in drone manufacturing.\n\"Today we have reached a point that 22 world countries are demanding to purchase unmanned aircraft from Iran,\" he said.\nThese 22 countries include Armenia, Algeria, Serbia, Tajikistan and Venezuela, although analysts are skeptical about the alleged interest from Serbia.\nWith Iranian-built Shahed-136 loitering munitions (so-called suicide drones) descending on Ukrainian cities almost every day, it's an indisputable fact that Iran has successfully exported a very large number of its drones to Russia.\nDespite this, Tehran officially denies the very existence of what could be \u2013 with the addition of an expected Russian acquisition of hundreds of Iranian ballistic missiles \u2013 its most significant arms export ever. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian even went so far as to say that Tehran \"should not remain indifferent\" if it is \"proven to us that Iranian drones are being used in the Ukraine war against people.\"\nIt suits Russia to support this self-evident falsehood. Moscow officially maintains that it only uses Russian hardware with \"Russian names\" in Ukraine. \"We do not have such information,\" said Russian presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov when asked about Russia's widely publicized acquisition of Iranian drones.\nIranian drones in Russian service do indeed have Russian names. The Shahed-136, for example, has been rebranded the Geran-2. The Houthis in Yemen also rebrand their Iranian-designed drones to cloak their otherwise obvious origin. For example, the Houthi versions of the Ababi-2 are known as the Qasef-1 and Qasef-2K, respectively.\nEven if Iran was open about its sale of drones to Russia, that deal certainly isn't indicative of an ascending Iranian drone industry that could rival that of Turkey or China.\nMoscow reportedly wanted a factory to build TB2s. There were also indicators an entire year before this war that it was fearful of these Turkish drones given their prior combat successes in Syria, Libya, and Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020. Turkey refuses to sell Russia the TB2, and China isn't willing to sell Russia its drones after the invasion since that would undoubtedly incur strong U.S. sanctions. These factors make it clear that Russia had nowhere else to turn other than Iran for large quantities of cheap drones to substitute and supplement its dwindling missile stockpiles.\nThat is, of course, not to say that Iran hasn't had export success elsewhere. Outside the Middle East, Ethiopia and Venezuela seem to have acquired Iran's Mohajer-6 armed drone. Tehran also inaugurated a factory in Tajikistan for the local assembly of its Ababil-2 drone, the first of its kind to build Iranian drones abroad. We may soon learn that a similar factory has been established in Russia for mass-producing Shaheds.\nStill, Turkish drones are much more prevalent in the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, Turkey is establishing factories for locally manufacturing its drones in Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and the United Arab Emirates.\nThe TB2 undoubtedly has a mixed reputation. Kurdish civilians terrorized by Turkish drone strikes in Iraq and Syria understandably have a much different view of them than Ukrainians \u2014 who effectively used their TB2s to halt Russia's advance on Kyiv early in the war. Russia's deployment of Iranian drones to terrorize Ukrainian civilians, on top of their prior use by militias in the Middle East, has given them a much more one-sided reputation as crude and indiscriminate terror weapons. That's probably one reason Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky chose one of the 300+ Shahed drones his forces have shot down in recent weeks to stand beside when he recently vowed Ukraine would \"clip the wings\" of Russia's airpower to constrain Moscow's ability to terrorize Ukrainian cities with Iran's assistance.\nIran will most likely find a dozen or so countries interested in procuring its drones. Safavi was probably telling the truth when he said 22 countries are interested in Tehran's drones. However, the majority of these countries have few other options for political or financial reasons. Therefore, the market for Iranian drones will most likely remain a relatively niche one that cannot realistically hope to attain the international success that Turkey's drone industry presently enjoys."

      "text": "\u201cFinally, something no one else has,\u201d a Russian journalist says during a TV documentary on the country\u2019s largest drone factory. \u201cSuch mass production of two-stroke engines doesn\u2019t exist anywhere else in Russia.\u201d\nThe factory in question, Alabuga, 600 miles east of Moscow in Russia\u2019s Tatarstan region, has been pumping out increasing numbers of the Iranian-designed Shahed-136 attack drone (known in Russia as Geran), but the man behind the site believes this may be one of its greatest achievements.\n\u201cThis is a complete facility,\u201d CEO Timur Shagivaleev adds in the documentary, explaining most of the components for the drone are now produced locally. \u201cAluminium bars come in, engines are made from them; microelectronics are made from electric chips; fuselages are made from carbon fiber and fiberglass \u2013 this is a complete location.\u201d\nThe claim signals that production of the Iranian-designed Shahed, which has been the backbone of Moscow\u2019s drone war on Ukraine, has now been mostly absorbed into Russia\u2019s military industrial machine. Analysts and intelligence officials believe 90% of production stages now happen at Alabuga or other Russian facilities.\nTo that end, recent satellite imagery shows the site is continuing to expand, with new production facilities and dorms that would allow it to scale up production exponentially. Analysts CNN spoke with believe this growth would allow Russia to potentially export an updated and battle-tested version of the drone it originally imported from Iran \u2013 maybe even to Tehran itself.\nBut a Western intelligence source says the expansion and the complete Russian integration of the Shahed-136, have effectively marginalized Iran, revealing a rift between Moscow and Tehran. They say Tehran has been growing increasingly impatient with the little return it\u2019s received from Russia, despite having supported Moscow\u2019s war effort with not just drones, but missiles and other assets.\nThat discontent effectively boiled over throughout Israel\u2019s 12-day bombing campaign of targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program in June, during which Russia\u2019s statements of condemnation were seen as paltry support for a country that has been helping Moscow since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\u201cIran may have expected Russia to do more or take more steps without being required to do so,\u201d Ali Akbar Dareini, an analyst for the Tehran-based Center for Strategic Studies, the research arm of the Iranian President\u2019s office, told CNN. They may not intervene militarily, but they may beef operative support, in terms of weapons shipments, technological support, intelligence sharing, or things like that.\u201d\nBut Russia\u2019s distant approach was not surprising for the Western intelligence official CNN spoke with, who argued it showed the \u201cpurely transactional and utilitarian nature\u201d of Russian cooperation with Iran.\n\u201cThis explicit disengagement demonstrates that Russia never intervenes beyond its immediate interests, even when a partner \u2013 here an essential supplier of drones \u2013 is attacked,\u201d they said.\nStrategic partnership\nAfter Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it began importing Iranian Shahed drones. By early 2023, Moscow and Tehran had inked a $1.75 billion deal for Russia to make the drones domestically.\nThe 6,000 drones by September 2025 stipulated in the initial contract were manufactured about a year ahead of schedule and, according to Ukraine\u2019s Defense Intelligence, Alabuga is now pumping out more than 5,500 units per month. It\u2019s also doing so in a more efficient and cost-effective way.\n\u201cIn 2022, Russia paid an average of 200,000 US dollars for one such drone,\u201d a Ukrainian Defense Intelligence source said. \u201cIn 2025, that number came down to approximately 70,000 US dollars.\u201d\nUkraine also said Russia has also modernized the drone, with improved communications, longer-lasting batteries and much larger warheads, making them deadlier and harder to bring down.\nThe Western intelligence official said Iran initially seemed to embrace Russia\u2019s efforts to localize roughly 90% of production of the Shahed 136 at Alabuga but Moscow\u2019s upgrades seem to have caught it off guard.\n\u201cThis evolution marks a gradual loss of control for Iran over the final product, which is now largely manufactured locally and independently,\u201d the source explained. They added Moscow\u2019s end goal is \u201cto fully master the production cycle and free itself from future negotiations with Tehran.\u201d\nDareini says Russia\u2019s predatory behavior is not surprising and describes the relationship between the two countries as \u201cboth cooperation and competition.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that Russians want more, to get more and give less, and this is this applies to Iran as well,\u201d he explained. \u201cIran has provided Russia with drones and technology and the factory, and it has not been for free.\u201d\nBut in the process of expanding, the official says, Alabuga has been unable to meet obligations to its Iranian partners. According to them, in addition to the loss of control over the final product, Iranian authorities and companies, namely Sahara Thunder, have complained that some payments have not been made, in part because of the suffocating international sanctions the Russian economy has been under for more than three years.\nCNN has been unable to independently verify this. CNN has reached out to the Alabuga administration for comment but has yet to hear back.\n\u201cThese obstacles add to Tehran\u2019s frustration with the blockages hindering the transfer of Russian aeronautical technologies to Iran, which were promised by Moscow in exchange for its support,\u201d the official added.\nSalvaging the relationship?\nThe ceasefire between Israel and Iran has seen Tehran mostly withdraw from the international sphere to regroup, reorganize and rebuild what was destroyed during the conflict. And in addition to the well-publicized damage to Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, Israel targeted several other Iranian facilities.\nDavid Albright, a former UN weapons inspector and head of the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) think tank, believes Alabuga\u2019s expansion may allow Moscow to provide some meaningful support and send some of the updated versions of the Shahed back to Iran.\n\u201cSome of [Iran\u2019s] drone production facilities were bombed and they fired a lot of [drones], so as a way to build back stock, they may do that,\u201d Albright said. \u201cAnd then then Iran could reverse engineer or receive the technology to make the better quality Shahed.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d he added.\nOther military equipment may be making its way to Tehran as well. Open-source flight tracking data shows a Gelix Airlines Ilyushin\u201376 military cargo plane flew from Moscow to Tehran on July 11.\nThe IL-76 is a heavy transport plane frequently used by the Russian military to ferry troops and military equipment, and Gelix Airlines has been associated with the transport of military equipment in the past.\nThe aircraft spent around three hours on the ground and then flew back to Moscow.\nCNN was unable to confirm what was on board but Iranian media reported it was the final components of a Russian S-400 air defense system.\nCNN asked the Russia Ministry of Defense for comment on the tension between the two countries but has not received a response. Similarly, CNN also reached out to the Iranian government, both in Tehran and via its embassy in the UK, but has yet to hear back.\nThese latest developments highlight Dareini\u2019s core belief about relations between the two countries: while there may be tension, ultimately Iran will also reap the benefits of the partnership.\n\u201cIran has got, and very likely will get the things it needs for its own security,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhether it\u2019s military hardware, whether it\u2019s in terms of economic cooperation, technology and whatever it needs.\u201d"

      "text": "In a one-hour-long exclusive interview with The War Zone on June 7, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov offered his unique take on a wide range of topics, from the state of the war to the advancements in Ukraine\u2019s drone boat campaign against Russia to whether Kyiv will attempt to attack Russian nuclear submarines. In this installment, Budanov, commander of Ukraine\u2019s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), told us how Russia is supplying technology and knowledge to help North Korea build long-range kamikaze drones and drastically improve the accuracy of its KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles. This is in addition to helping to develop Pyongyang\u2019s fledgling submarine-based nuclear deterrent. North Korea has become a key supporter of Russia\u2019s war effort, providing millions of artillery rounds and even troops in exchange.\nBudanov says the ability to produce the Shahed family of drones, in particular, which has been the most prolific long-range aerial threat to Ukraine for years, is being given to North Korea. Originally provided by Iran, Russia is now building about 2,000 per month with plans to increase that to 5,000 per month. Russia is continually improving their range, payload, connectivity and attack patterns. Between Sunday night and Monday alone, Russia launched 479 Shaheds and decoys of various types across Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian Air Force.\nHaving Shaheds will give North Korea the ability to hit targets anywhere in South Korea and potentially in huge volumes. They can overwhelm the South\u2019s air defenses, paving the way for attacks by other munitions. They could also be exported back to Russia to support the war in Ukraine.\nThe first batch of KN-23s North Korea provided to Russia were woefully inadequate. According to a report from Ukrainian state prosecutors, around half of them \u2014 also known as Hwasong-11 \u2014 not only deviated from their trajectory but also exploded in midair. Since then, they have been dramatically improved thanks to Russian help, Budanov told us, now striking with deadly accuracy. This has given Russia a badly needed source of SRBMs.\nThese improvements could extend beyond the KN-23s. While Budanov did not specify what was changed, this is likely to boost the capabilities of its many other ballistic missiles, extending the dangers beyond the peninsula.\nRussian aid to North Korea, Budanov suggests, will alter the balance of power on the peninsula.\nWith that background out of the way, here are the questions and answers pertaining to these issues from our interview, which have been lightly edited for clarity:\nQ: What are the latest developments about North Korea and its assistance to Russia?\nA: [There are] agreements on the beginning of the creation of capabilities to produce UAVs of the Garpiya and Geran [the Russian version of Iranian Shahed-136 drones] types on the territory of North Korea. It will for sure bring changes in the military balance in the region between North Korea and South Korea.\nQ: How many of these drones will Russia help North Korea develop?\nA: So they just agreed to start the organization of this production on the territory of North Korea.\nQ: What else is Russia giving North Korea in turn for supplying troops and weapons?\nA: It\u2019s more about technology transfer.\nQ: What kind of technology?\nA: One example is the technology for the production of UAVs. The other technological solution is, I told you before about the KN-23 ballistic missiles. Initially, with the beginning of the transfer to Russia, they were flying with a deviation of a few kilometers, but now they are exactly hitting the target. This is the result of the common work of Russian and North Korean specialists. Also, there is the modernization of the aviation means of engagement \u2014 long-range air-to-air missiles. Particular technologies on submarines. Unfortunately, ballistic missiles which are carriers of nuclear payloads.\nQ: So Russia is helping North Korea improve its nuclear weapon system as well?\nA: So let\u2019s say they had huge problems with the carriers of these missiles and the firing from their sea component. And Russians are helping them with this. And the great demonstration of this for everybody is, as I mentioned before, this famous KN-23 ballistic missile. The KN-23 missiles that were delivered in the very beginning, now it\u2019s an absolutely different missile in [terms] of their technical characteristics. The accuracy is increased many times.\nQ: What\u2019s the latest on North Korean troops, weapons and equipment being delivered to Russia, and what is Russia giving in return? How many North Korean troops are in Russia, and is any new equipment going there?\nA: The range of armaments provided by North Korea to Russia is quite wide, starting with [122mm] D-74 [howitzers] and 107mm infantry variant [multiple launch rocket systems] MLRS systems to 240mm MLRS and the 170mn M1989 [Koksan self-propelled artillery guns]. Unfortunately, this gun is demonstrating itself quite well in battle. It\u2019s firing from quite a long range, and it\u2019s quite good in terms of accuracy.\nQ: How many Koksans have they gotten and how many will they get?\nA: We have data that the Russian Federation was provided 120 pieces. But I think that supply will continue because these guns are demonstrating themselves quite well. This is unfortunate for us because this is artillery for long-range firing.\nQ: How many North Korean troops are there in Russia now?\nA: There are about 11,000 North Korean troops in Kursk Oblast. But there is also the problem of the visit of [Sergei Shoigu], the Secretary of the National Security Council of the Russian Federation, to North Korea. And there he, among other things, agreed on the beginning of work of so-called labor migrants on the territory of Russia in order to partially replace the labor migrants from Central Asia that they consider as not stable for their state and vulnerable to recruitment by our special services and Western ones. But there is a big probability that people among this labor migrant, they will start to sign contracts with the Ministry of Defense of Russia. And it wouldn\u2019t be the warriors from North Korea. It would be Russian warriors, but of North Korean nationality.\nQ: How many of those migrant workers from North Korea do you anticipate will go?\nA: So this agreement just happened recently. That\u2019s why we [are] just working on the specific numbers. And we would like to answer this question. We need to confirm the exact number that will come to Russia.\nStay tuned for our second installment from our most recent interview with Budanov that includes discussions about recent aid provided to Russia by China and Iran.\nContact the author: howard@thewarzone.com"

      "text": "Turkey hopes to unveil its new Bayraktar TB3 drone this year. The armed drone is a successor to the TB2, well-known for its combat successes in Libya, Syria, Nagorno-Karabakh, and, most recently, Ukraine. Unlike its TB2 predecessor, the TB3 is designed as a naval drone capable of operating from short runways and ship decks.\nTurkey also hopes to commission its navy's new flagship, the TCG Anadolu (L-400), an amphibious assault ship based on Spain's Juan Carlos I, this year as well. Turkey had previously contemplated ordering a small fleet of fifth-generation F-35B Lightning II short-takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) fighters for the Anadolu. However, Ankara was banned from buying any F-35s in 2019 after acquiring advanced S-400 air defense missile systems from Russia.\nInstead, Turkey decided it would use the Anadolu mainly as a drone carrier. After all, if there is one thing that Turkey has proven itself capable of designing, developing, and deploying, it is armed drones. Thanks to their foldable wings, between 30-50 TB3s could operate from the Anadolu once it's completed.\nAnd Turkey isn't just content with building TB3s for its shiny new flagship. It hopes to export these drones to other countries as it has done with the TB2.\n\"The upcoming TB3 will be a great fit for Japan's Izumo-class platforms,\" said Haluk Bayraktar, CEO of the TB2 and TB3's manufacturer Bayak, in March.\nBayraktar might be on to something. Most navies cannot hope to field anything like a modern-day American supercarrier, so most make do with amphibious assault ships, landing helicopter docks like the Anadolu.\n\"Japan's Izumo-class ships were designed for VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft (such as helicopters), as such, it is smaller than a conventional aircraft carrier,\" James Rogers, Assistant Professor in War Studies at SDU in Denmark, told me. \"This being said, the TB3 has been specially designed for take-off and landing on short runway aircraft carriers, and they have foldable wings, so the TB3 could be a way for these smaller 'carriers' to have a fixed-wing longer-range airpower capacity.\"\nRogers went on to note that the TB3 is \"set to fill an important capabilities gap for Turkey.\"\n\"With F-35Bs still unable to be exported to Turkey, the TB3 will provide Turkey's TCG Anadolu amphibious assault ship with operational offensive airpower,\" he said. \"If this proves successful, it will pave the way for other countries with similar ships to launch what is effectively a 'Drone Aircraft Carrier', where amphibious assault ships are turned into 'drone motherships'.\"\nAside from providing armed drones for the Anadolu, Baykar may have aims to dominate an emerging market for naval military drones.\n\"Airborne drones for the maritime domain are a growth area in military drone development,\" Rogers said. \"Russia is experimenting with large VTOL drones and drones launched by catapults from ships for use in and around the Northern Sea Route.\"\n\"Yet, out of necessity, Turkey is leading the way with the TB3 for national military use and potential future international sales.\"\nGiven the fact that the TB3 is designed primarily for naval operations, can it realistically replicate the export success of its land-based TB2 predecessor?\n\"The TB3 will initially ride off the reported operational success of the TB2 across the world,\" Baker said. \"From Libya to Ukraine, the TB2 has been promoted by Turkey as a world-leading drone system, but the TB3 will still need to be proven in the longer term and sold in a responsible way to mitigate misuse by new drone actors.\"\n\"Nevertheless, I can see the TB3's BLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) flight ability and automated take-off and landing systems being a unique selling point of the TB3 over the TB2,\" he concluded.\n\"It is an indicator of Turkey trying to cement its place as a 'drone superpower'.\""

(Baykar Makina )\nThe Japan Ministry of Defense (MoD) has been testing medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to finalise procurements best suited to meet the requirements of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF).\nA spokesperson for the MoD told Janes on 21 August that the MoD tested the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Heron MK II, and is currently testing T\u00fcrkiye's Bayraktar TB2 UAVs for the JGSDF.\n\u201cThe test and evaluation of the Heron Mk II concluded in FY [fiscal year] 2024, while the Bayraktar TB2 is scheduled to complete its demonstration trials within the current fiscal year,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nThe spokesperson added that the MoD has not yet decided if it will procure these UAVs. \u201cThe selection of specific systems for potential procurement will be determined through a careful and comprehensive assessment of various factors. In general, defence equipment procurement is conducted through a comprehensive evaluation process that reflects Japan's security environment and considers factors such as performance, cost, and logistical sustainability,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nHeron Mk II and Bayraktar TB2 can be deployed by the JGSDF to enhance intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). The tests of these UAVs and the MoD's intended procurements are in line with Japan's 2025 defence White Paper, which underscores the need to procure more unmanned systems that can support the Japan Self-Defense Forces' (JSDF's) ISR and combat operations.\nLooking to read the full article?\nGain unlimited access to Janes news and more..."

      "text": "The first drone war opens a new chapter in India-Pakistan conflict\nThe world's first drone war between nuclear-armed neighbours has erupted in South Asia.\nOn Thursday, India accused Pakistan of launching waves of drones and missiles at three military bases in Indian territory and Indian-administered Kashmir - an allegation Islamabad swiftly denied.\nPakistan claimed it had shot down 25 Indian drones in recent hours. Delhi remained publicly silent. Experts say the tit-for-tat attacks mark a dangerous new phase in the decades-old rivalry, as both sides exchange not just artillery but unmanned weapons across a volatile border.\nAs Washington and other global powers urge restraint, the region is teetering on the edge of escalation, with drones - silent, remote and deniable - opening a new chapter in the India-Pakistan conflict.\n\"The Indo-Pak conflict is moving into a new drone era - one where 'invisible eyes' and unmanned precision may determine escalation or restraint. Thus, in South Asia's contested skies, the side that masters drone warfare won't just see the battlefield - they'll shape it,\" Jahara Matisek, a professor at the US Naval War College, told the BBC.\nSince Wednesday morning, Pakistan says Indian air strikes and cross-border fire have killed 36 people and injured 57 more in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. On the other side, India's army reports at least 16 civilians dead from Pakistani shelling. India insists its missile barrage was retaliation for a deadly militant attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam last month - an attack Islamabad denies any role in.\nPakistan's military announced on Thursday that it had shot down 25 Indian drones across various cities, including Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. The drones - reportedly Israeli-made Harop drones - were reportedly intercepted using both technical and weapon-based countermeasures. India claimed to have neutralised several Pakistani air defence radars and systems, including one in Lahore, which Islamabad denied.\nLaser-guided missiles and bombs, drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become pivotal in modern warfare, significantly enhancing the precision and efficiency of military operations. These can relay co-ordinates for airstrikes or, if equipped, directly laser-designate targets, and help immediate engagement.\nDrones can be used as decoys or suppression of enemy air defences, flying into contested airspace to trigger enemy radar emissions, which can then be targeted by other munitions like loitering drones or anti-radiation missiles. \"This is how Ukraine and Russia both do it in their war. This dual role - targeting and triggering - makes drones a force multiplier in degrading enemy air defences without risking manned aircraft,\" says Prof Matisek.\nExperts say India's drone fleet is largely built around Israeli-made reconnaissance UAVs like the IAI Searcher and Heron, along with Harpy and Harop loitering munitions - drones that double as missiles, capable of autonomous reconnaissance and precision strikes. The Harop, in particular, signals a shift toward high-value, precision-targeted warfare, reflecting the growing importance of loitering munitions in modern conflict, experts say.\nThe Heron, say experts, is India's \"high-altitude eyes in the sky\" for both peacetime monitoring and combat operations. The IAI Searcher Mk II is designed for frontline operations, offering up to 18 hours of endurance, a range of 300km (186 miles), and a service ceiling of 7,000m (23,000ft).\nWhile many believe India's combat drone numbers remain \"modest\", a recent $4bn deal to acquire 31 MQ-9B Predator drones - which can can fly for 40 hours and up to an altitude of 40,000ft - from the US marks a major leap in its strike capabilities.\nIndia is also developing swarm drone tactics - deploying large numbers of smaller UAVs to overwhelm and saturate air defences, allowing higher-value assets to penetrate, say experts.\nPakistan's drone fleet is \"extensive and diverse\", comprising both indigenous and imported systems, Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst told the BBC.\nHe said the inventory includes \"over a thousand drones\", featuring models from China, Turkey and domestic manufacturers. Notable platforms include the Chinese CH-4, the Turkish Bayraktar Akinci, and Pakistan's own Burraq and Shahpar drones. Additionally, Pakistan has developed loitering munitions, enhancing its strike capabilities.\nMr Haider said the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) has been actively integrating unmanned systems into its operations for nearly a decade. A key focus is the development of \"loyal wingman\" drones - unmanned aerial vehicles designed to operate in co-ordination with manned aircraft, he added.\nProf Matisek believes \"Israel's technical assistance, supplying Harop and Heron drones, has been pivotal for India, while Pakistan's reliance on Turkish and Chinese platforms highlights an ongoing arms race\".\nWhile the recent drone exchanges between India and Pakistan mark a significant escalation in their rivalry, they differ markedly from the drone-centric warfare observed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, experts say. There, drones become central to military operations, with both sides deploying thousands of UAVs for surveillance, targeting and direct attacks.\n\"Deploying drones [in the ongoing conflict] instead of fighter jets or heavy missiles represents a lower-level military option. Drones are less heavily armed than manned aircraft, so in one sense, this is a restrained move. However, if this is merely a prelude to a broader aerial campaign, the calculus changes entirely,\" Manoj Joshi, an Indian defence analyst, told the BBC.\nEjaz Haider believes the recent drone activity in Jammu \"appears to be a tactical response to immediate provocations, not a full-scale retaliation [by Pakistan]\".\n\"A true retaliatory strike against India would involve shock and awe. It would likely be more comprehensive, involving multiple platforms - both manned and unmanned - and targeting a broader range of objectives. Such an operation would aim to deliver a decisive impact, signalling a significant escalation beyond the current tit-for-tat exchanges,\" Mr Haider says.\nWhile drones have fundamentally reshaped the battlefield in Ukraine, their role in the India-Pakistan conflict remains more limited and symbolic, say experts. Both countries are using their manned air forces to fire missiles at one another as well.\n\"The drone warfare we're witnessing may not last long; it could be just the beginning of a larger conflict,\" says Mr Joshi.\n\"This could either signal a de-escalation or an escalation - both possibilities are on the table. We're at an inflection point; the direction we take from here is uncertain.\"\nClearly India is integrating drones into its precision-strike doctrine, enabling stand-off targeting without crossing borders with manned aircraft. However, this evolution also raises critical questions.\n\"Drones lower the political and operational threshold for action, providing options to surveil and strike while trying to reduce escalation risks,\" says Prof Matisek.\n\"But they also create new escalation dynamics: every drone shot down, every radar blinded, becomes a potential flashpoint in this tense environment between two nuclear powers.\""

      "text": "CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand \u2014 Despite a recent accident with an Israeli-built drone, South Korea\u2019s military is pressing ahead ahead with unmanned technology, including a stealthy loyal wingman designed to accompany the air force\u2019s new KF-21 Boramae fighters.\nThe accident occurred on March 17, when an IAI Heron-1 drone belonging to Korea\u2019s army veered off a runway upon landing at Yangju, subsequently colliding with a parked Surion helicopter. Both aircraft were written off, meaning the army has now lost all three of its Herons in accidents.\nNonetheless, the country is under the gun to accelerate its drone plans \u2013 and for reasons outside immediate military-equipment considerations.\nKim Jae Yeop, senior researcher at the Sungkyun Institute for Global Strategy in Seoul, told Defense News South Korea\u2019s low birth rate, amongst the lowest in the world, is looming large.\n\u201cThe number of regular troops in the armed forces, which is now roughly 500,000, will highly likely decrease to fewer than 400,000 in the next decade,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAs a result,\u201d Kim explained, \u201cSeoul is taking active measures to expand the role of military unmanned systems to offset the reduction in troops. They can be acquired at significant scale at a lower cost and without risk to life in missions.\u201d\nOne important program saw Korean Air roll out a new loyal wingman technology demonstrator \u2013 called the Low Observable Unmanned Wingman System, or LOWUS \u2013 on Feb. 25.\nThe stealthy turbofan-powered LOWUS, funded by the Agency for Defense Development since 2021, was unveiled at the Korean Air Tech Center in Pusan. Its maiden flight is expected later this year, ahead of manned-unmanned teaming flight tests in 2027.\nPossessing an internal weapons bay and looking similar to the American XQ-58A Valkyrie, Korean Air lists a length of 10.4m and wingspan of 9.4m for the aicraft.\nAs with similar loyal wingman concepts by other major powers, the idea for the drone sidekicks is fly missions ranging from strike to surveillance, jamming and escort.\nThe LOWUS will likely have a domestic engine and active electronically scanned array radar. Korean Air gained experience with requisite stealth technologies when developing the blended-wing KUS-FC, or Kaori-X, drone that first flew in 2015.\nIn the future, Korea\u2019s air force is expected to introduce composite squadrons of manned fighters and loyal wingmen.\n\u201cConsidering the fact that only a small number of countries like the U.S., Australia and Russia have been producing and testing similar kinds of systems, the LOWUS highlights Seoul\u2019s technological achievements,\u201d said Kim.\nAnother program currently underway comprises a search for loitering munitions for Korean special forces units. A platform is due to be selected later this year, and Seoul is allocating around $22 million to this acquisition.\nForeign types like the Switchblade 600 and Hero 120 are under consideration, with the aim being to give special forces strike drones they can use independently against North Korean invaders without the need for calling in external fire support.\nGordon Arthur is an Asia correspondent for Defense News.

The intellectual property will be jointly shared between T\u00fcrkiye and Saudi Arabia,\" Bayraktar stated.\nThe Saudi agreement covers the procurement of approximately 60 Akinci UCAVs along with technology transfer and local production capabilities. The deal represents one of the largest defense export contracts in the Republic's history, with deliveries scheduled between 2025 and 2026.\nManufacturing will occur at SAMI facilities in Saudi Arabia, where airframe, avionics, wiring and subsystems will be produced locally alongside software sharing. Turkish defense companies Aselsan and Roketsan are collaborating to manufacture smart bombs, electro-optical systems and guidance kits.\nSAMI and Baykar signed three additional memoranda of understanding in July 2024 to expand UAV system cooperation.\nThe Bayraktar TB3 UCAV is an indigenously developed armed unmanned aerial vehicle designed for takeoff and landing on short-runway amphibious assault ships.\nThe system features foldable wings enabling operations from naval vessels and can conduct reconnaissance, surveillance, intelligence and assault missions.\nBayraktar TB3's key performance specifications:\nThe TB3 offers fully autonomous takeoff and landing capabilities with line-of-sight and beyond-line-of-sight communications for remote operations.

      "text": "On Sept. 13, Ukraine\u2019s defense ministry tweeted photos of the remains of an Iranian-built Shahed-136 drone its forces had shot down over the country\u2019s eastern Kharkiv province. The incident occurred just two months after the White House disclosed that Iran was supplying \u201chundreds\u201d of its domestically-built military drones to Russia and mere weeks after the first delivery of these armed drones was confirmed.\nIt was a striking reminder of the new rapidly unfolding reality: Middle Eastern powers are now supplying armed drones to the two warring sides in the Russo-Ukrainian War. Historically, this is a significant turnabout. After all, during the long years of the Cold War, the United States and its Western allies, on the one side, and the Soviet Union, on the other, supplied stupendous quantities of arms to warring Middle East countries. This was aptly exemplified by the frantic, simultaneous U.S. and Soviet airlifts of armaments and supplies to their regional allies, Israel on the one side and Egypt and Syria on the other, during the October 1973 Arab-Israeli War.\nNow, as Europe endures its most dangerous and destructive conflict since the end of the Second World War, it is rival Middle East powers that are actively arming both sides.\nBayraktars for Kyiv\nTurkey began supplying Ukraine with its well-known Bayraktar TB2 drones before this war erupted following Russia\u2019s Feb. 24 invasion. There were also discussions before Feb. 24 to build a factory for locally manufacturing Turkish drones on Ukrainian soil. Russia\u2019s invasion has failed to force Ankara and Kyiv to abandon these plans. In retrospect, it may well have unwittingly proven to have sped them up.\nAnkara did not cease supplying Kyiv with TB2 drones after Feb. 24. In fact, the size of Ukraine\u2019s fleet appears to have more than doubled since then. Before the war, Turkey supplied about two-dozen TB2s. Since the war began, Kyiv has reportedly received at least 50 drones, with even more on the way. These armed drones played a substantial role helping Ukraine repel Russia\u2019s invasion, especially early in the war when Moscow had its sights set on Kyiv.\nPlans are still underway to build that Turkish drone factory in Ukraine. On Sept. 9, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky received Haluk Bayraktar, the CEO of Baykar Defense, manufacturer of the eponymous Bayraktar drones, in Kyiv. \u201cWe discussed the details of the construction of the Baykar factory in Ukraine and the production of new products using Ukrainian components,\u201d Zelenskyy said after their meeting.\nFurthermore, according to Turkey\u2019s state-run press, the Ukraine plant will assemble the new Bayraktar Ainici drone (which is far larger, more heavily armed and advanced than the TB2) and the upcoming Kizilelma uncrewed fighter jet.\nShaheds for Moscow\nIran\u2019s supply of drones to Russia is far more recent and in its early stages. As early as 2019, Russia, according to Iran\u2019s state-run press, expressed interest in potentially acquiring some of Iran\u2019s indigenously-produced drones. Tehran has developed a variety of drones, from reconnaissance and surveillance to armed and \u201csuicide\u201d models, also known as loitering munitions.\nIt would not be surprising if Iran and Russia also have plans to jointly manufacture Iranian drones on Russian soil, especially as Moscow is ultimately seeking to acquire hundreds of these drones per the White House claim. Such a move would not be unprecedented for Tehran. After all, it opened a factory for building its Ababil-2 drones in Tajikistan in May. Furthermore, Iranian drones are relatively easy to manufacture. Tehran has already taught some of its proxy militias how to locally assemble them clandestinely in countries such as Yemen and Iraq.\nThe Ukraine conflict is the first one in which Iranian drones have been used outside of the Middle East (Turkish-built TB2s, on the other hand, have seen combat in Syria, Libya, and Nagorno-Karabakh). While they are not likely to singlehandedly turn the tide of the war in Russia\u2019s favor, there are already some indications that they could pose a serious threat to the Ukrainian forces. Shahed-136s recently destroyed one of Ukraine\u2019s long-range American-supplied M777 howitzers, an artillery system that has played an important role, alongside Ukraine\u2019s American M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), in countering Russia\u2019s powerful artillery. A Ukrainian colonel told the New York Times that if Kyiv is not provided with adequate countermeasures, these Iranian-supplied drones \u201cwill destroy all our artillery.\u201d According to President Zelensky, Ukraine has shot down eight Iranian drones so far in this conflict.\nConclusion\nIf this war drags on into the coming months and years, it would not be surprising if more sophisticated and deadly Turkish and Iranian drones appear over that Eastern European battlefield. Turkey and Iran may well use Ukraine as an opportunity to test their newer drones in a more challenging combat environment. Russia cynically used Syria as a \u201clive-fire training opportunity\u201d for several weapons systems it had never used in combat. Turkey\u2019s Akinci could potentially make its combat debut in this war in Ukrainian service. Russia and Iran, which have expanded their military-technical cooperation since the start of this war, may even jointly develop new drones after extensivelyevaluating the combat performance of existing Iranian models in this war.\nNobody knows for sure what will happen next in Ukraine. However, the influx of Middle Eastern-made weaponry into a European conflict is already unprecedented in modern history. Neither Turkey nor Iran will likely stop arming these two bitter adversaries anytime soon. If anything, they will likely expand these armament programs quantitatively and qualitatively, further enabling Moscow and Kyiv to continue fighting for the foreseeable future."
