  "title": "Commentary: Disney's settlement with 'Mandalorian' actor Gina Carano isn't capitulation. Firing her was",
  "description": "Disney's settlement with Gina Carano is not an indictment of 'cancel culture' or another example of corporate capitulation. It was simply the right thing to do.",
  "content": "Actress Gina Carano, Lucasfilm and its parent company Walt Disney Co. have settled the federal lawsuit filed in which Carano claimed that, in 2021, she was wrongfully terminated from her role in \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d after she expressed her conservative political views on social media.\n\nThe settlement details have not been made public, but Lucasfilm released a statement praising Carano\u2019s on-set professionalism and expressing the hope of \u201cidentifying opportunities to work together with Ms. Carano in the near future.\u201d\n\nI am here to beg everyone to remain calm and avoid using the four Cs: cancel culture (is this the end of it?) and corporate capitulation (is this another example of it?)\n\nNo and no.\n\nCancel culture has long been an amorphous and often recklessly applied term, used to describe a litany of events, including but certainly not limited to male predators losing their jobs, students protesting their school\u2019s choice of graduation speakers and outrage over J.K. Rowling\u2019s stance on transgender women.\n\nRecently, however, it has taken a far more concrete shape that looks astonishingly like the White House where President Trump continues to literally cancel all manner of things, including U.S. membership in the World Health Organization, the regulatory power of the Environmental Protection Agency and huge portions of Medicaid. Recently, he fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after the bureau documented weaker than expected numbers for July and downward revisions for the previous two months.\n\nCorporate capitulation, too, is alive and well, with law firms, universities and media companies falling like dominoes before Trump\u2019s lawsuits and threats of defunding. Last year, Trump sued ABC and its parent company Disney for defamation after anchor George Stephanopoulos wrongly stated on air that Trump had been found civilly liable for raping E. Jean Carroll \u2014 Trump had been found civilly liable of sexually assaulting and defaming Carroll. Disney settled for $15 million, paid to Trump\u2019s presidential foundation and museum.\n\nEven more troubling was Paramount Global\u2019s decision to pay a $16-million settlement in what many consider a frivolous lawsuit brought by Trump against \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d After late-night host Stephen Colbert called the move a \u201cbig fat bribe\u201d designed to ensure Paramount\u2019s recent acquisition by Skydance, CBS, which is owned by Paramount, announced that \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d was being canceled due to financial considerations.\n\nSo while it is tempting to see Disney settling with Carano as a piece of a larger and very worrisome whole, particularly when Elon Musk financed her lawsuit, it was in fact simply the right thing to do.\n\nCarano is a former mixed martial artist turned actor who has been vocal about her support for conservative causes and President Trump. In 2020, she had caught some flack for posting \u201cbeep/bop/boop\u201d as her pronouns in her Twitter bio, which some took as her way of mocking trans people. She denied this, changed her bio and expressed support for the trans community.\n\nThere were also posts that criticized masking policies and shutdowns during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as one calling for an investigation into voter fraud after the 2020 election.\n\nBut it was a repost on Instagram that cost her her job \u2014 in February 2021, she reposted a famously horrific image of a half-naked Jewish woman fleeing from a mob with a moronically simplistic message about divisive politics: \u201cMost people today don\u2019t realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews. How is that any different from hating someone for their political views?\u201d\n\nLanding just a month after then-President Trump sent an armed mob to attack the Capitol in the hopes of overturning an election he refused to believe he had lost, the post, which appeared to compare MAGA supporters in 2021 America with Jews in Nazi Germany, sparked #FireGinaCarano.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what Disney did. Calling her posts \u201cabhorrent and unacceptable,\u201d Lucasfilm excised her character from \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d and canceled an upcoming spinoff in which she was to star. Her talent agency, UTA, dropped her and Hasbro canceled a line of toys based on her \u201cMandalorian\u201d character.\n\nIt was an overreaction that smacked of fear and pandering. I do not agree with the sentiments Carano expressed in her posts, but compared with the blithely toxic abuse regularly used on social media, they are relatively benign, based far more on genuine ignorance \u2014 most people are in fact aware of the vicious antisemitism leveraged by the Nazis as well as their institutionalized tactics of fear \u2014 than anything else.\n\nOf course, those who attempt to be politically provocative on social media (and reposting a photo of a victimized Jewish woman in such context is the definition of political provocation) cannot then feign shock and dismay when people are provoked, especially at a time when far-right tweets, including the president\u2019s, had led to a violent attack against lawmakers. (Hence the irony of Musk\u2019s support \u2014 the platform he renamed X was in large part built on its ability to harness all manner of just and unjust hashtag campaigns.)\n\nBut as my colleague Robin Abcarian noted when Carano filed her lawsuit in 2023, the social media mob\u2019s decision that a woman, who was far from a household name, deserved to lose her livelihood, and more important, Lucasfilm\u2019s agreement with that decision, was extreme.\n\nBad publicity is never good for an entertainment property and whether it was explicit in her contract or not, Carano did represent, to a certain extent, \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d Lucasfilm and Disney. Unfortunately, the entertainment industry\u2019s increasing reliance on social media has created a world in which actors and other creative types are expected to amass millions of followers on platforms that tend to reward the outspoken and outrageous over the thoughtful. Encouraged to reveal themselves \u201cauthentically,\u201d stars can find themselves prodded by fans to comment on current events and excoriated when they refuse or respond in a way that certain followers consider insincere or politically incorrect.\n\nTelling people to stay off social media is not the answer; neither is regulation by hashtag campaign.\n\nWhile Carano\u2019s case is certainly reflective of many perils that face us at the moment, the fact that she reached a settlement, including an apparent promise of more work, is not a sign of further deterioration.\n\nThe fear that our cultural landscape is being attacked by political forces that would strangle the notion of free speech and competing ideologies is real and justified. But in this case, the capitulation came not when Disney and Lucasfilm decided to settle with Carano, but when they fired her in the first place.",

      "text": "A raging Trump digs in on his trade war, fires official after brutal jobs report\n- Share via\n- U.S. job growth stalled in July, with just 73,000 jobs added.\n- President Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, accusing her without evidence of manipulating unemployment data.\n- Trump escalated his trade war, imposing new tariffs on imports from 66 countries.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is doubling down on its trade war against much of the world despite increasingly harrowing economic numbers emerging at home, with stock markets and Treasury yields tumbling Friday on news of the most significant slowdown in job growth since the pandemic.\nGovernment data showed the U.S. economy added 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 far fewer than expected \u2014 and issued revised numbers for the prior two months that showed only 19,000 jobs were created in May, and 14,000 in June, amid widespread uncertainty over President Trump\u2019s tariff policies and deep cuts to government employment.\nThe unemployment numbers came a day after Trump signed an executive order increasing tariffs on 66 countries, further roiling a decades-old system of global trade.\nThe chair of the White House council of economic advisors reacted to the unemployment report by saying the numbers are \u201cnot what we want to see.\u201d But Trump responded by directing his team to fire the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a nonpartisan position responsible for overseeing the statistical analysis of jobs data, suggesting the numbers were politically \u201cmanipulated.\u201d She was fired hours later.\nU.S. hiring is slowing sharply as President Trump\u2019s erratic and radical trade policies paralyze businesses and raise doubts about the outlook for the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\u201cI was just informed that our Country\u2019s \u2018Jobs Numbers\u2019 are being produced by a Biden Appointee, Dr. Erika McEntarfer, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, who faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala\u2019s chances of Victory,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.\nMcEntarfer was confirmed by a Senate vote of 86 to 8 in January 2024. He did not offer evidence to support his accusations of manipulated data, either for this year or before the 2024 election.\n\u201cWe need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can\u2019t be manipulated for political purposes.\u201d\nParadoxically, Trump and his team also seemed to acknowledge the authenticity of the numbers by blaming the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, for the disappointing results.\nFor months, Powell has resisted pressure from Trump to lower interest rates amid concerns over stubbornly high inflation \u2014 and the prospect that prices will increase further if the president\u2019s trade war persists. The Federal Reserve chairmanship is another position meant to operate with independence.\n\u201cInflation has cooled, wages have increased, unemployment is stable, and the private sector is growing,\u201d Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said in a statement to The Times. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s America First agenda has ensured new jobs go to American citizens, instead of illegals or foreign-born workers. The tariffs are raking in billions of dollars to make our country wealthy again. Jerome \u2018Too Late\u2019 Powell needs to cut rates so our economy can continue to boom.\u201d\nAt the closing bell, the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen more than 500 points, while the NASDAQ was down over 2.25%. The U.S. dollar fell against other currencies. But the most telling moves may have occurred in the bond market, which saw the most drastic slumps in 10-year and two-year Treasury yields in a year.\nThe increased unemployment rate, to 4.2%, came off government data reported earlier in the week that showed a dramatic decrease in imports and consumer demand to the United States, figures that have temporarily inflated economic growth numbers. Overall, economists are warning that U.S. gross domestic product could grow less than 2% this year, its worst performance since the height of the pandemic.\nTrump has had issues with unemployment data for many years, often using one of his favorite terms, \u201cfake,\u201d to describe them. During his 2016 campaign, he argued that unemployment was worse than the government figures showed; once in the White House, he suggested the official data understated the strength of the economy.\nInvestors are beginning to realize that Trump never follows through on his tariff threats, inspiring the TACO trade: \u2018Trump always chickens out\u2019\nThe timing of the latest jobs report comes at a politically inopportune moment for Trump, who had set Friday as a deadline for countries around the world to negotiate trade deals with the United States on his terms, or face steep tariff rates.\nOnly a handful of framework agreements were struck \u2014 with the European Union, South Korea, Japan, the United Kingdom and Vietnam, among others \u2014 while dozens of other nations were hit with rate hikes. Major trading partners faced brutal increases, including Brazil, which now faces a 50% rate on most goods, and India, hit with 25% import duties.\nSwitzerland was slammed with a 39% rate, but most countries on the list released by the White House were given 15% tariff rates. The new import taxes are to take effect Aug. 7.\nEconomists have warned since April 2, when Trump declared \u201cLiberation Day\u201d from a global system of free trade, that his new policies would devastate the U.S. economy, raising prices and slowing growth in the short term while depressing living standards for years to come.\n\u201cThe good news,\u201d Trump wrote on Friday, \u201cis that Tariffs are bringing Billions of Dollars into the USA!\u201d\nTariff discussions remain unresolved for Canada and Mexico, two of the United States\u2019 largest trading partners. Though Trump said this week that Friday was a firm deadline and would not be extended, on Thursday he said new tariffs on some Mexican goods would be delayed 90 days while the two countries continue to negotiate.\nPalm Springs is bracing for an economic hit. Canadian snowbirds are canceling vacations and selling property because of Trump.\nCanada, on the other hand, remains at an impasse with the president over his demands. Trump increased tariffs to 35% on many Canadian goods, which went into effect Friday.\n\u201cWe will continue to negotiate with the United States on our trading relationship,\u201d Prime Minister Mark Carney said in a statement, but, \u201cthe Canadian government is laser focused on what we can control: building Canada strong.\n\u201cWe can give ourselves more than any foreign government can ever take away,\u201d he added."

      "text": "Why are America\u2019s most powerful institutions capitulating to Trump?\n- Share via\nLike ancient oaks uprooted by tornadoes, some of America\u2019s richest and most powerful institutions have been capitulating to Donald Trump. Law firms, universities, even Supreme Court justices have surrendered to Trump\u2019s most outlandish demands that they cede their governing principles to him and pay financial tribute that runs into hundreds of millions of dollars.\nThe rationale for some of Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 social and economic \u2014 are mysterious. But a greater mystery is why these institutions have given in, sometimes without a whisper of defiance.\nThe capitulation trend has encompassed some American institutions that made their names standing firm against authoritarianism. One is CBS, whose parent, Paramount Global, last month settled a $20-billion Trump lawsuit over the editing of an interview with Kamala Harris at \u201c60 Minutes\u201d by paying $16 million, ostensibly to finance Trump\u2019s presidential library.\nA nation of sheep will beget a government of wolves.\n\u2014 Edward R. Murrow, former CBS News icon\nThe settlement \u201cresembled payment of an extortion-like penalty to the government for the standard editing\u201d of the Harris interview, Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for Leadership Studies and a leading professor at the Yale School of Management, wrote in The New Republic with two Yale colleagues.\nAs my colleague Meg James reported, critics blasted the settlement, with one calling it a \u201cspineless capitulation\u201d that would only embolden politicians and others to \u201cweaponize lawsuits and bring regulatory pressure to bear to silence and censor independent journalism.\u201d\nShortly after the settlement, as it happens, CBS announced the cancellation of Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cLate Show,\u201d silencing a widely followed Trump critic (at least on broadcast TV). The network attributed its decision to economic factors, but it\u2019s been commonly seen as related to the settlement with Trump.\nSonnenfeld ably placed the settlement in the context of CBS\u2019s distinguished journalistic history, which he traced back to the work of Edward R. Murrow in the 1930s and later; under Murrow, he noted, the news division of CBS became \u201cthe gold standard of broadcast journalism.\u201d\nIn settling what many legal commentators regarded as a frivolous lawsuit, Sonnenfeld wrote, Paramount\u2019s goal appeared to be securing the government\u2019s approval of its then-pending $8-billion merger with Skydance Media.\nThe merger promptly received approval from the Federal Communications Commission and closed on Aug. 7, completing what Sonnenfeld called a \u201csellout of the Columbia Broadcasting System\u2019s journalistic values to commercial interests.\u201d\nMany of the other deals with Trump similarly subordinate the institutions\u2019 moral or ethical values to commercial or financial concerns.\nTrump administration immigration and travel policies could have severe negative effects on L.A. events such as the World Cup and Olympics.\nI asked Paramount for a response to Sonnenfeld\u2019s commentary, and received a statement that \u201ccompanies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable costs of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial or reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause.\nCBS is far from alone. Indeed, in the media sphere it was preceded by the Walt Disney Company, which in December settled Trump\u2019s lawsuit over ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos\u2019 on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. In fact, Trump had been found liable for sexually assaulting and defaming Carroll, not for rape. The settlement involved a $15-million contribution for Trump\u2019s presidential library.\nLeading universities have surrendered to Trump accusations of antisemitism and gender discrimination. Columbia (from which I hold a graduate degree) agreed last month to pay $221 million to \u201cresolve\u201d government allegations that it has violated federal anti-discrimination laws. Brown University also reached an agreement with the White House last month to pay $50 million toward workforce development programs in its home state, Rhode Island.\nTrump has recently turned his crosshairs on UCLA, freezing more than $300 million in research grants on the ostensible grounds that the university has failed to \u201cpromote a research environment free of antisemitism.\u201d UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk has responded that \u201cthis far-reaching penalty of defunding life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination.\u201d\nAt least nine leading national law firms have also capitulated to Trump attacks by agreeing to payments totaling $940 million, according to a compilation by Axios, including pro-bono legal representation for conservative entities and other commitments.\nThese settlements often involve non-financial commitments. Some institutions under Trumpian fire agree to end programs promoting workforce, student and faculty diversity, equality and inclusion, or \u201cDEI,\u201d to cite the common conservative shibboleth, or to eliminate other forms of outreach. In effect, they\u2019re ceding control over their academic structures to the White House.\nHiltzik: Stephen Miller says Americans will live better lives without immigrants. He\u2019s blowing smoke\nWill mass deportations make wait times at the ER get shorter and schools have more money? The truth is just the opposite\nInstitutions that have fought back have often been able to block administration threats in federal trial and appellate courts. That\u2019s been true for four law firms that have challenged Trump. Harvard, the target of a concentrated attack by Trump, has won a temporary restraining order against the administration\u2019s effort to prevent the university from enrolling foreign students. A separate lawsuit over Trump\u2019s threat to freeze scientific and other academic grants to the university and its affiliates is pending.\nThe surrendering institutions typically have cited the economic consequences of opposition. Trump\u2019s threat to withhold research funding, which can run to billions of dollars a year, has rattled universities. In explaining Columbia\u2019s nine-figure payoff to the administration, Acting President Claire Shipman stated that most of the $400 million in federal research grants that Trump canceled in March will be reinstated, \u201cand Columbia\u2019s access to billions of dollars in current and future grants will be restored.\u201d The university said the settlement would close \u201ca period of sustained federal scrutiny and institutional uncertainty.\u201d\nAt the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison\u2014the first law firm to reach a deal with Trump\u2014Chairman Brad Karp said the deal was made to reverse Trump\u2019s executive order cutting its lawyers off from government contracts, revoking their security clearances and prohibiting them from entering government buildings or dealing with federal employees. That all amounted to \u201can existential crisis\u201d for the firm, Karp told his partners and associates.\nIt\u2019s possible, though never stated outright, that the surrendering institutions recognize that the clock is running on Trump\u2019s authority. His presidency runs only until Jan. 19, 2029. (Never mind his musings about a third term, which would be unconstitutional. On the Gonna Happen scale, that\u2019s a Not.) They may simply be buying time in the expectation that a succeeding president will reverse the strictures he has imposed. In the meantime, courts may quash his threatened punishments as illegal or unconstitutional infringements of 1st Amendment rights.\n\u201cAppeasement may well be a viable strategy when the party being appeased is willing to take the win and stand down,\u201d writes Steve Vladeck of Georgetown law school. But it\u2019s \u201ca potentially catastrophic approach\u201d that can end up enabling, even encouraging, more bad behavior.\nColumbia, for example, thought that by acceding to Trump\u2019s demands in March to discipline students involved in a pro-Palestinian protest and placing its Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department under \u201cacademic receivership\u201d and appointing an outside chair to run the unit for five years, won it a restoration of research funding. This proved to be untrue, leading to its $221-million settlement in July.\nTrump\u2019s proposed 50% cut in NASA\u2019s science budget would turn the agency into an empty shell. Who\u2019s behind this?\nEven while mounting a legal fight against Trump, Harvard has shuttered its diversity offices, which served minority and LGBTQ students and women, in July\u2014steps that resembled demands from the Trump administration as part of an offer to restore potentially billions of dollars in research funding. But those actions haven\u2019t appeared to quell Trump\u2019s attacks on the university. The university has said that it \u201cremains committed to cultivating a community where all of its members can thrive.\u201d\nThe truth is that Trump can do a lot of damage to institutional interests while he remains in office and legal challenges wend their way through the federal judicial system on their way to possible consideration by the Supreme Court. Even if the High Court ultimately finds Trump\u2019s actions to be illegal, the process takes time and money, neither of which the plaintiffs will recover.\nAs Trump\u2019s public standing begins to erode, new signs of resistance are emerging among his likely targets. Within the Big Ten conference, faculty senates at 14 of the 18 member schools have passed what amount to mutual aid commitments, aimed at coordinating \u201ca unified and vigorous response\u201d to political attacks, in the words of the model resolution developed at Rutgers.\n(The other 17 schools are the universities of Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin; Indiana University; Michigan State, Ohio State and Penn State; Purdue; Northwestern; UCLA; and USC.) The faculties at Purdue, UCLA and USC haven\u2019t yet signed up, but dozens of other schools have inked so-called mutual academic defense compacts.\nOne can only wonder if the trend toward capitulation to Trump\u2019s bare-knuckled threats will have lasting consequences for the rule of law, social norms and the reputations of the submissive institutions. Some law firms that made deals with Trump to protect their business interests have lost clients that came to doubt that they would stand up forthrightly for the clients\u2019 interests.\nSonnenfeld alluded to the possible aftermath in his brief against Paramount/CBS, which he described as a \u201ctragic capitulation of First Amendment rights, accompanied by a demoralizing and brand-tarnishing political appeasement.\u201d He closed his essay with a fitting quote attributed to Murrow: \u201cA nation of sheep will beget a government of wolves.\u201d\nMore to Read\nInsights\nL.A.

The Los Angeles Times editorial staff does not create or edit the content.\nIdeas expressed in the piece\nAmerica\u2019s most powerful institutions, including CBS, Columbia University, Brown University, and major law firms, are abandoning their core principles by capitulating to Trump\u2019s demands and paying hundreds of millions in settlements. The article characterizes this as resembling \u201cpayment of an extortion-like penalty\u201d rather than legitimate legal resolution.\nThese settlements represent a fundamental betrayal of institutional values, with CBS\u2019s $16 million payment particularly egregious given the network\u2019s distinguished history under Edward R. Murrow, when it served as \u201cthe gold standard of broadcast journalism\u201d. The settlement coincided with the cancellation of Stephen Colbert\u2019s show, silencing a prominent Trump critic.\nThe capitulation strategy is fundamentally flawed and counterproductive, as institutions that initially tried appeasement, like Columbia University, discovered that giving in to demands did not provide lasting protection. Columbia\u2019s March concessions failed to restore research funding, ultimately requiring a $221 million settlement in July.\nInstitutions that have fought back through the courts have achieved better outcomes, with Harvard winning a temporary restraining order and four law firms successfully challenging Trump\u2019s threats. This demonstrates that legal resistance can be more effective than submission.\nThe trend toward capitulation sets dangerous precedents that will embolden further attacks on institutional independence and academic freedom, ultimately weakening the rule of law and democratic norms. As one critic noted, the settlements will make it \u201cpolitically harder for the next university to fight back\u201d[1].\nDifferent views on the topic\nInstitutions justify their settlements as prudent business decisions to avoid the substantial costs and unpredictable risks of prolonged legal battles. Companies settle litigation to prevent \u201csignificant financial or reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause\u201d.\nUniversity administrators argue that settlements serve their institutions\u2019 broader mission by restoring critical funding streams. Columbia\u2019s Acting President Claire Shipman emphasized that most of the $400 million in canceled federal research grants would be reinstated, ensuring \u201cColumbia\u2019s access to billions of dollars in current and future grants will be restored\u201d.\nLaw firm leaders describe their settlements as responses to existential threats to their operations. Paul, Weiss chairman Brad Karp characterized Trump\u2019s executive order cutting off government contracts and revoking security clearances as creating \u201can existential crisis\u201d for the firm that required immediate resolution.\nSome institutions may be pursuing a strategic waiting game, recognizing that Trump\u2019s presidency has finite duration ending January 19, 2029. They may be \u201cbuying time in the expectation that a succeeding president will reverse the strictures he has imposed\u201d while courts potentially overturn Trump\u2019s actions as unconstitutional.\nLegal experts suggest appeasement could be viable under certain circumstances. Georgetown law professor Steve Vladeck notes that \u201cappeasement may well be a viable strategy when the party being appeased is willing to take the win and stand down,\u201d though he acknowledges it carries significant risks."

      "text": "Stanislaus County settles notorious malicious prosecution case for $22.5 million\n- Share via\nSix years after a jury acquitted a Modesto defense attorney and his codefendants in an alleged murder conspiracy, Stanislaus County has agreed to settle a malicious prosecution lawsuit for $22.5 million, one of the largest payouts of its kind in the history of the California courts.\nCounty supervisors approved the settlement Tuesday on the threshold of a trial in the federal case, which was brought by eight plaintiffs who contended that police and prosecutors had fabricated the charges against them.\nAt the heart of the case was the late Frank Carson, a veteran Modesto defense attorney with a pugilistic style who delighted in antagonizing police and prosecutors. The ill feeling toward him at the Stanislaus County district attorney\u2019s office was no secret.\nIn August 2015, after a three-year investigation, the district attorney\u2019s office accused him of masterminding a complicated plot to kill a scrap-metal thief, Korey Kauffman, as revenge for the alleged theft of pipes on Carson\u2019s property.\nEight others were charged with helping Carson murder Kauffman or covering up the crime: two brothers who owned a local liquor store; three members of the California Highway Patrol; Carson\u2019s wife and stepdaughter; and a drug-addled handyman who cut a deal in exchange for his cooperation.\nNo physical evidence linked any of the defendants to the death of 26-year-old Kauffman, whose fragmented skeleton was found in the Stanislaus National Forest in 2013, 17 months after he vanished. Kauffman, who stole habitually to feed his meth addiction, ran in a world where many people had wished him harm.\nBut investigators at the district attorney\u2019s office \u2014 including those Carson had publicly denounced and ridiculed \u2014 decided to focus on him based on a tip that Kauffman had planned to steal from Carson\u2019s property. The case resulted in an 18-month preliminary hearing and a 17-month trial, the second-longest murder trial in California history. Even as he stood trial for murder, Carson continued to practice law at the downtown Modesto courthouse.\n\u201cI\u2019m getting paid back for 25 years of putting my thumb in the eye of the man,\u201d Carson would say.\nThe Times explored the case in a 2021 podcast, \u201cThe Trials of Frank Carson.\u201d\nThe star witness was the handyman, Robert Woody, who according to testimony was smoking crystal meth when he confessed to a girlfriend that he had killed Kauffman and fed his body to the pigs. Police arrested him, and Woody insisted he had made up the story to impress the girlfriend.\n\u2018The Trials of Frank Carson\u2019 is a true crime podcast about power, politics and law in California\u2019s Central Valley. Carson was Stanislaus County\u2019s most controversial defense attorney, a wizard with juries and a courtroom brawler with an unapologetically caustic style.\nBut a lead investigator in the district attorney\u2019s office, Kirk Bunch \u2014 a man Carson had attacked as \u201cdishonest and unprofessional\u201d \u2014 promised Woody dire consequences if he didn\u2019t cooperate, in an interview captured on tape.\n\u201cWe can go for the death penalty or life without parole,\u201d Bunch told Woody, who eventually gave prosecutors an elaborate story implicating Carson and others.\nWoody\u2019s story shifted many times, often under highly suggestive questioning from law enforcement, and he failed to lead police to a single piece of physical evidence linked to the homicide.\nThat did not stop prosecutors from building their case on his word. At trial, he testified that Carson had asked liquor store owner Bobby Athwal to watch out for thieves on his junk-strewn lot in Turlock, where \u2014 Woody claimed \u2014 he witnessed Athwal and his brother fatally attack Kauffman.\nIn an interview with The Times after the trial, Woody said he made up the whole account because he had no other choice. He was facing a charge of first-degree murder and wanted to see his family again. He described his testimony as \u201cmake-believe\u201d and \u201cstories they wanted to hear.\u201d\nIn the end, Woody, who was allowed to plead no contest to manslaughter in exchange for a seven-year prison term, was the only person convicted in connection with Kauffman\u2019s death.\nCarson and the liquor store owners, Athwal and his brother Daljit, were acquitted in June 2019, and charges against the other co-defendants were tossed out by the court or prosecutors.\nCarson\u2019s family believes the stress of the criminal case, including 17 months he spent in jail, destroyed his health and contributed to the heart attack that killed him at age 66, a year after his acquittal.\n\u201cThey called him aggressive, but he was the kind of defense attorney who stood up for his clients,\u201d said Carson\u2019s widow, Georgia DeFilippo, whose cut of the settlement is $4 million. \u201cI think it broke his heart and broke his spirit. He wasn\u2019t the same.\u201d\nShe said she would like to see criminal charges brought against former Stanislaus County Dist. Atty. Birgit Fladager, who presided over the prosecution, and against others in her office.\n\u201cThey invented a fiction and placed us in there as if we were characters in a badly written novel,\u201d she said this week. \u201cI\u2019ll never get over the fact that that could be done, and they were able to walk away from it without any real [consequences].\u201d\nModesto defense attorney Frank Carson spent years accusing local police and prosecutors of corruption. One day they accused him of masterminding a sprawling murder and cover-up conspiracy.\nDeFilippo said she believes that she and her daughter were arrested on spurious charges merely to pressure her late husband into pleading guilty to a murder he didn\u2019t commit.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t care about me or my daughter or those poor highway patrolmen. They ruined their lives. They were after Frank,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll never think about law enforcement the same way. I wake up and think, \u2018Thank God I\u2019m not in prison.\u2019\u201d\nShe is co-executor of Carson\u2019s estate, which will also receive $4 million in the settlement. Her attorney, Gary Gwilliam, described the case as \u201ca cautionary tale.\u201d\n\u201cThis is what happens when the government goes after people they don\u2019t like,\u201d Gwilliam said.\nHe said that during depositions in the civil case, the prosecutors and law enforcement officers who targeted Carson did not acknowledge that they had done anything wrong. \u201cYou can take it to the bank there was never any discipline of anybody,\u201d Gwilliam said. \u201cThey said they thought they did the right thing. \u2018We thought Woody was credible.\u2019 They have to toe the line.\u201d\nThe case was rife with mistakes, including the assignment of key roles to investigators with \u201cpronounced histories of enmity\u201d toward Carson and reliance on a witness, Woody, who had an incentive to lie, according to an analysis by Matt Murphy, a former Orange County prosecutor who served as an expert witness for the plaintiffs.\nIn a detailed report, Murphy said the \u201cacrimonious history\u201d between Carson and local prosecutors should have compelled the district attorney\u2019s office to recuse itself. He concluded that the case should not have been filed in the first place. \u201cI do not believe any reasonable jury would ever have convicted these defendants,\u201d he wrote.\nDoug Maner, a former Stanislaus County prosecutor and frequent critic of the district attorney\u2019s office, said the prosecution was \u201cthe most horrible abuse of justice\u201d and that the size of the settlement suggested a realistic fear that jurors might deliver a much larger penalty had the case gone to trial.\n\u201cThe risk must have been gigantic to pay $22.5 million for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey obviously must have been concerned about a judgment double, triple that, which would have been appropriate under the facts of this case.\u201d\n\u201cThey went after the defense attorney they hated most,\u201d he said. \u201cThey took an attorney and locked him up for a year and filed charges against his wife and his [step]daughter to extort a plea.\u201d\nThe $22.5 million will be divided among the eight plaintiffs, including the three former CHP officers and the liquor store owners.\nThomas Boze, Stanislaus County counsel, said the money will be paid from the county general fund and insurance.\nStanislaus County Dist. Atty. Jeff Laugero, who took office in January 2023, described the settlement as \u201ca necessary step to close a difficult chapter and maintain our focus on current public safety priorities.\u201d"

      "text": "Gina Carano sues Disney for firing her from \u2018The Mandalorian,\u2019 with help from Elon Musk\n- Share via\nGina Carano wants a jury to get her \u201cStar Wars\u201d job back.\nThe former \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d actor filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Walt Disney Co., Lucasfilm and Huckleberry Industries alleging wrongful termination and discrimination for her dismissal from the Disney+ series. Carano, who had portrayed former Rebellion soldier Cara Dune for two seasons on \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d had come under fire in 2021 for a number of problematic social media posts when Lucasfilm issued a statement that she was no longer employed by the studio.\nAccording to the complaint filed in California federal court, Carano is seeking more than $75,000 in compensatory damages and to force Lucasfilm to reinstate her as Dune in a jury trial. Elon Musk, through X, the company formerly known as Twitter, is helping to fund Carano\u2019s lawsuit.\n\u2018The Mandalorian\u2019s\u2019 Gina Carano will not be part of future \u2018Star Wars\u2019 projects after Lucasfilm deemed her social media posts \u2018abhorrent and unacceptable.\u2019\nOn Tuesday, Carano recounted in a post on X how an attorney hired by the social media site had reached out to her about her situation after she had responded to one of Musk\u2018s posts that offered to help those who had lost their jobs for their activity on the social media platform.\n\u201c[A] few months ago I received an email from a lawyer who had been hired by X to look into my story & many others,\u201d Carano wrote. \u201cTurns out after sending them as much information as I could gather these past few months, my now lawyers & X believe whole-heartedly in my case & are moving forward.\u201d\nX\u2019s head of business operations Joe Benarroch said in a statement to press including the Hollywood Reporter and Variety that the company was financially supporting supporting Carano\u2019s lawsuit \u201cas a sign of X Corp.\u2019s commitment to free speech ... empowering her to seek vindication of her free speech rights on X and the ability to work without bullying, harassment, or discrimination.\u201d\n\u201cPlease let us know if you would like to join the lawsuit against Disney,\u201d added Musk in a post on X.\nIn February 2021, Carano shared a since-deleted Instagram post that implied being a conservative today is comparable with being Jewish during the Holocaust. She had also previously been called out for right-wing posts that falsely claimed voter fraud affected the results of the 2020 presidential election, mocked wearing masks amid the COVID-19 pandemic and made fun of respecting people\u2019s pronouns.\nOn more than one occasion, Carano\u2019s social media statements incited critics to declare her racist or transphobic and demanded she be fired from the series. Others would rally around her in support, urging people to cancel Disney+ instead.\nFrom Jonathan Majors\u2019 disastrous ABC News interview to his new relationship, observers say poor PR moves will complicate the actor\u2019s comeback from a December assault conviction.\nIn response to questions about Carano\u2019s status with the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise at the time, Lucasfilm issued a statement clarifying that she was \u201cnot currently employed\u201d with the studio and that \u201cthere [were] no plans for her to be in the future.\u201d The company also described Carano\u2019s problematic social media posts as \u201cabhorrent and unacceptable.\u201d\nBut according to Carano, Lucasfilm\u2019s 2021 statement was untrue because she alleges she was promised a role in the since-shelved \u201cStar Wars\u201d spinoff \u201cRangers of the New Republic.\u201d\nCarano and her attorneys claim that not only was the actor fired for her social media posts, she was \u201ctargeted, harassed, publicly humiliated, [and] defamed\u201d for making \u201cpolitical statements that did not align with what [Disney] believed was an acceptable viewpoint.\u201d\nThe complaint also alleges Carano was harassed when the company demanded she make a public apology after she was called on to explain her position and required to meet with representatives of GLAAD. It claims that Carano was discriminated against because male actors who made left-leaning political statements, such as those that mocked Republicans, were not subject to the same treatment as Carano.\nDisney has not responded to request for comment."

(I\u2019d never heard of it either.) An official statement, claiming that the \u201cLate Show\u201d cancellation represents \u201ca purely financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night \u2026 not related in any way to the show\u2019s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount\u201d (italics mine) is \u2014 however true it might be \u2014 just the sort of thing to make one say, \u201cPull the other one.\u201d\n\u201cOther matters\u201d would seem to refer to the merger and to Paramount\u2019s recent payment of $16 million to settle a frivolous Trump lawsuit over the perfectly routine editing of a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Kamala Harris interview that was somehow supposed to give Harris an unfair advantage in the 2024 election and to have caused her opponent \u201cmental anguish\u201d \u2014 a payment Colbert characterized in a monologue just a few days ago as a \u201cbig fat bribe\u201d: \u201cAs someone who has always been a proud employee of this network, I am offended.

But just taking a stab at it, I\u2019d say $16 million would help.\u201d\nCBS attributed the cancellation to \u2018a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.\u2019\nThough he responded to his studio audience\u2019s supportive boos saying, \u201cYeah, I share your feelings,\u201d he was only kind to the network: \u201cI do want to say that the folks at CBS have been great partners,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful to the Tiffany network for giving me this chair and this beautiful theater to call home.\u201d\nBut there have been plenty of surrogates to draw connections, provide context and bite harder, especially in light of the departure of \u201c60 Minutes\u201d executive producer Bill Owens and CBS News President Wendy McMahon. \u201cLove you Stephen,\u201d ABC host Jimmy Kimmel, posted on Instagram, \u201cadding \u201cF\u2014 you CBS and all your Sheldons.\u201d (In January, ABC also settled a Trump suit for $16 million, over George Stephanopoulos erroneously saying that Trump had been found civilly liable of \u201crape.\u201d)\nOf the remaining late-night hosts, we may say that each is special in their own way. Colbert, 61, who has been at \u201cThe Late Show\u201d for 10 years, is the most mature, professorial and philosophical \u2014 gentle, a gentleman, and at times a mock-gentleman, addressing his audience as \u201cMy fellow Americans,\u201d or echoing Walter Winchell, \u201cMr. and Mrs. America and All the Ships at Sea,\u201d or as \u201cLadies and Gentlemen.\u201d He slaps himself in the face twice before every show to \u201cbe in the moment \u2026 [to] only do this for the next hour.\u201d Though he may still kick up his heels during a monologue, as an interviewer he is composed and thoughtful and curious \u2014 and funny, to be sure \u2014 to the degree each conversation demands. A committed (liberal) Catholic, he co-narrated the English-language audiobook of Pope Francis\u2019 \u201cLife: My Story Through History,\u201d with Franciscan Father John Quigley, at the same time, he\u2019s a first-generation Dungeons & Dragons devotee, a lifelong reader of science fiction and a man of whom director Peter Jackson said, \u201cI have never met a bigger Tolkien geek in my life.\u201d (Jackson cast him as \u201cLaketown spy\u201d in \u201cThe Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.\u201d) He\u2019s a person who will quote Gandalf in a conversation on grief and loss with Anderson Cooper, or, on \u201cThe Friendship Onion\u201d podcast with Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd, a.k.a. Merry and Pippin, declare that after reading \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d after college, \u201cI realized that Aragorn is the Apollonian model of manhood \u2026 The Hobbits are us. And we should love life as much as they do.\u201d\nAnd he knows a thing or two about Ronnie James Dio.

Because it ran on basic cable and not network television, and because Colbert hid within the character of a pompous conservative pundit, the show could take wild swings; to the extent it looked respectable, it was only a matter of irony. Colbert and Jon Stewart, on whose \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d where Colbert had earlier worked, staged a \u201cRally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear\u201d on the National Mall in Washington, which drew a crowd of more than 200,000; he ran for president twice and created a PAC, Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow, \u201c100 percent legal and at least 10 percent ethical.\u201d\nDuring its run, he (or his writers) gave the world \u201ctruthiness,\u201d named 2006\u2019s Word of the Year by Merriam-Webster, which defined it as \u201ca truthful or seemingly truthful quality that is claimed for something not because of supporting facts or evidence but because of a feeling that it is true or a desire for it to be true.\u201d Colbert was twice named one of Time\u2019s 100 Most Influential People. Ben & Jerry\u2019s created an ice cream flavor, Stephen Colbert\u2019s AmeriCone Dream, in his honor, and NASA dubbed a piece of exercise equipment for use on the International Space Station the \u201cCombined Operational Load-Bearing External Resistance Treadmill,\u201d or COLBERT.\nTestifying in character in 2010, before a House Judiciary subcommittee on legal status for immigrant farmworkers, he said, as if looking into 2025, \u201cThis is America,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want my tomato picked by a Mexican. I want it picked by an American, then sliced by a Guatemalan and served by a Venezuelan in a spa where a Chilean gives me a Brazilian \u2026 My great grandfather did not travel over 4,000 miles of the Atlantic Ocean to see the country overrun by immigrants. He did it because he killed a man back in Ireland. That\u2019s the rumor, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. I\u2019d like to have that stricken from the record.\u201d\nThe signature segment of \u201cThe Late Show\u201d is the \u201cColbert Questionert\u201d in which the host poses 15 questions \u201cergonomically designed to penetrate straight to the soul of one of my guests and reveal their true being to the world.\u201d (It\u2019s \u201ca scientifically verified survey; I\u2019ve asked several scientists and they assured me \u2014 yeah, it\u2019s a survey.\u201d) Designed to create comic and/or sincere responses, they range from \u201cWhat\u2019s the best sandwich?\u201d (Will Ferrell: \u201cSalami and grapefruit on rye, with a light sheen of mayonnaise.\u201d) to \u201cApples or oranges?\u201d (Colbert considers apples the correct answer, because you can put peanut butter on them.) to \u201cThe rest of your life in five words.\u201d (Tom Hanks: \u201cA magnificent cavalcade of color.\u201d) Cate Blanchett took it lying on Colbert\u2019s desk, as if in therapy. \u201cWhat do you think happens when we die?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou turn into a soup,\u201d she replied. \u201cA human soup.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s Colbert\u2019s extended interviews and discussions, from \u201cThe Late Show\u201d and elsewhere, posted online, that dig the deepest and reveal the most about him in the bargain: a much circulated conversation with Nick Cave from last year; a long talk with Anderson Cooper, after the death of his mother, both about grief and gratitude; an episode of \u201cThe Spiritual Life With Fr. James Martin, S.J.,\u201d from a couple of weeks ago. (Colbert describes himself as \u201cpublicly Catholic,\u201d not \u201ca public Catholic.\u201d) Such discussions perhaps point the way to a post-\u201dLate Show\u201d practice for Colbert, much as it became one for David Letterman, who passed the seat on to him. (He\u2019s only the second host since the show\u2019s premiere in 1993.)\nAs to the field he\u2019ll be leaving next May, who can say? Taylor Tomlinson\u2018s \u201cAfter Midnight\u201d game show, which followed \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d expired this week. Kimmel and Seth Meyers, who go as hard against Trump as does Colbert, and the milder Jimmy Fallon, seem for the moment safely fixed at their desks. Though new platforms and viewing habits have changed the way, and how much, it\u2019s consumed, late-night television by its temporal nature remains a special province, out at the edge of things, where edgy things may be said and tried. (Don\u2019t expect Colbert to go quietly into that goodnight.) Yet even as the No. 1 show in late night, \u201cThe Late Show\u201d reportedly loses money. There\u2019s something to that \u201cfinancial decision,\u201d I\u2019m sure; it\u2019s the \u201cpurely\u201d that smells. We\u2019ll see.\n\u201cI absolutely love that Colbert got fired,\u201d Trump posted on his vanity social media site, going on to say that he \u201chears\u201d that \u201cJimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert.\u201d Trump and Colbert could not be farther apart as humans. The president sells fear; he uses it as a club. But the TV host is sanguine.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t laugh and be afraid at the same time,\u201d Colbert is fond of saying, sometimes adding, \u201cand the Devil cannot stand mockery.\u201d"

My desires remain in the arts, which is where I hope you will join me.\u201d\nShe also thanked X owner and billionaire Elon Musk, who funded her lawsuit against Disney, calling it a \u201cGood Samaritan deed\u201d from someone she had never met.\nA Lucasfilm spokesperson said in a statement Thursday that the company looked forward to \u201cidentifying opportunities to work together\u201d with Carano in the \u201cnear future,\u201d now that the lawsuit was concluded. The company did not disclose the conditions of the settlement.\nDisney\u2019s settlement with Gina Carano is not an indictment of \u2018cancel culture\u2019 or another example of corporate capitulation. It was simply the right thing to do.\n\u201cMs. Carano was always well respected by her directors, co-stars, and staff,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cShe worked hard to perfect her craft while treating her colleagues with kindness and respect.\u201d\nThe settlement comes a little more than a year after Carano sued Burbank-based Disney, Lucasfilm and Huckleberry Industries after she was dismissed from the Disney+ series. Carano, who portrayed former Rebellion soldier Cara Dune for two seasons, had been criticized for several controversial social media posts.\nIn one now-deleted post, she implied that being conservative today was comparable with being Jewish during the Holocaust. Critics had also called out posts in which she falsely claimed voter fraud affected the results of the 2020 presidential election, derided pandemic-era mask mandates and made fun of stating people\u2019s pronouns.\nHer social media postings ignited a firestorm of controversy, with critics calling for her to be fired from the series, while her supporters urged others to cancel Disney+ instead.\nIn 2021, a Lucasfilm representative said in a statement that Carano was not currently employed by the \u201cStar Wars\u201d production company, and that there were \u201cno plans for her to be in the future.\u201d The statement also called her posts \u201cabhorrent and unacceptable.\u201d\nCarano claimed at the time that she had been promised a role in the now-shelved \u201cStar Wars\u201d spinoff \u201cRangers of the New Republic.\u201d In her lawsuit, she said she was \u201ctargeted, harassed, publicly humiliated, [and] defamed\u201d for making \u201cpolitical statements that did not align with what [Disney] believed was an acceptable viewpoint.\u201d\nShe had been seeking more than $75,000 in damages and to be reinstated in her role in \u201cThe Mandalorian.\u201d"

Some called the settlement a stain on the proud legacy of CBS News.\n- For months, Paramount executives have been torn over how to handle Trump\u2019s $20-billion lawsuit. The dispute helped prompt the departure of two senior CBS News executives.\nCritics blasted Paramount Global\u2019s decision to pay $16 million to settle President Trump\u2019s lawsuit over \u201c60 Minutes\u201d edits, calling the move a \u201cspineless capitulation\u201d that erodes U.S. press freedoms.\nParamount late Tuesday agreed to a landmark settlement with Trump to end his $20-billion broadside against CBS News. The president will not be paid directly, or indirectly, as part of the deal, Paramount said. Instead, the money will go to cover Trump\u2019s legal fees and help finance his future presidential library.\nParamount\u2019s leaders hope the settlement will help clear a path for Trump-appointed regulators to bless the company\u2019s $8-billion sale to David Ellison\u2019s Skydance Media. They wanted to tamp down tensions with the president.\nBut journalists and others on Wednesday said the payment will embolden attacks by Trump and his allies on news outlets. Some called the settlement a stain on the proud legacy of CBS News, the onetime home of such fearless journalists as Edward R. Murrow, Walter Cronkite and Mike Wallace.\n\u201cThis is a shameful decision by Paramount,\u201d Clayton Weimers, executive director of Reporters Without Borders USA, said in a statement. \u201cShari Redstone and Paramount\u2019s board should have stood by CBS journalists and the integrity of press freedom. Instead, they chose to reward Donald Trump for his petty legal assault.\u201d\nPresident Trump had filed a $20-billion lawsuit claiming a \u201860 Minutes\u2019 interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris was manipulated to show her in a flattering light. Trump alleged the news interview was \u2018election-threatening.\u2019\nTrump\u2019s legal team quickly celebrated the settlement, saying: \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit.\u201d\nBob Corn-Revere, chief counsel for the non-profit 1st Amendment advocacy organization Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, took an opposing view, saying wider repercussions would result.\n\u201cA cold wind just blew through every newsroom,\u201d Corn-Revere said in a statement. \u201cParamount may have closed this case, but it opened the door to the idea that the government should be the media\u2019s editor-in-chief.\u201d\nFederal Communications Commissioner Anna M. Gomez, the lone Democrat on the panel, said the settlement was \u201ca desperate move [by Paramount] to appease the Administration and secure regulatory approval of a major transaction currently pending before the FCC.\u201d\n\u201cThis moment marks a dangerous precedent for the 1st Amendment, and it should alarm anyone who values a free and independent press,\u201d Gomez said.\nThree Senate Democrats warned that any payment to Trump to gain favorable treatment by regulators could violate federal anti-bribery laws. Paramount\u2019s dealings with Trump \u2018raises serious concerns of corruption and improper conduct,\u2019 they said.\nFor months, Paramount executives have been torn over how to handle Trump\u2019s $20-billion lawsuit. The dispute helped prompt the departure of two senior CBS News executives who tried to hold their ground, particularly as \u201c60 Minutes\u201d continued airing stories that took a hard look at Trump\u2019s policies and actions.\nJournalists were horrified by the board\u2019s willingness to settle the case rather than defend 1st Amendment freedoms.\nCBS News staffers feared the company would be forced to apologize when they said they did nothing wrong. (The settlement, negotiated through a mediator, did not require an apology.)\n\u2018They have to get [the deal] approved,\u2019 said Mario Gabelli, a longtime Paramount shareholder. Gabelli and others are eager for a new chapter, but the Skydance deal has turned into a fitful slog.\nThe legal wrangling began in October when CBS broadcast different portions of an answer given by then-Vice President Kamala Harris to a question about the Biden administration\u2019s waning clout with Israel\u2019s prime minister.\nCBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d program ran a clip of Harris giving a muddled response to the question. A day later, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d aired a different portion of her answer. This one was forceful and succinct.\nCBS has acknowledged editing Harris\u2019 answer.\nTrump and fellow conservatives seized on the edits, claiming CBS had manipulated Harris\u2019 answer to make her appear more authoritative to enhance her standing with voters. He called the edits an example of election interference.\nCBS has long denied such claims.\nParamount Co-Chief Executive George Cheeks said during the company\u2019s shareholder meeting Wednesday that settlements are designed for companies to avoid \u201cbeing mired in uncertainty and distraction.\u201d\n\u201cCompanies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable costs of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial or reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause,\u201d Cheeks said.\nThat rationale did little to mollify detractors who alleged that Trump\u2019s complaints were thin.\nParamount\u2019s settlement \u201cwill be remembered as one of the most shameful capitulations by the press to a president in history,\u201d said Seth Stern, director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation.\nParamount said the agreement with Trump included a release from threatened defamation claims.\nBut it\u2019s not clear that Paramount\u2019s headaches will go away.\nThree left-leaning U.S. Senators \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) want to take a closer look at Paramount\u2019s decision-making.\nIn May, the senators sent a strongly worded letter to Paramount\u2019s controlling shareholder, Redstone. They cautioned that a settlement could be viewed as bribing an elected official to win favorable regulatory treatment with regard to the Skydance merger.\n\u201cThis could be bribery in plain sight,\u201d Warren said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m calling for a full investigation into whether or not any anti-bribery laws were broken.\u201d\n\u201cWhen Democrats retake power, I\u2019ll be first in line calling for federal charges,\u201d Wyden separately wrote in a post on the Bluesky social media site. \u201cIn the meantime, state prosecutors should make the corporate execs who sold out our democracy answer in court.\u201d\nParamount on Thursday asked a federal judge in Texas to dismiss the $20-billion lawsuit. The media company separately has agreed to have a mediator look at the case.\nSome journalists said they feared the settlement could have a chilling effect, particularly among news organizations that lack deep pockets or have unrelated business pending before the federal government.\n\u201cCBS News may weather the financial hit, but smaller newsrooms facing similar legal threats could be pushed to the brink,\u201d Tim Richardson, journalism and disinformation program director at the nonprofit PEN America, said in a statement.\n\u201cThe danger is clear,\u201d Richardson said, calling the settlement a \u201cspineless capitulation.\u201d\n\u201cEmboldened politicians and powerful actors will feel more free than ever to weaponize lawsuits and bring regulatory pressure to bear to silence and censor independent journalism.\u201d"

The photograph was taken in 1941, during the Lviv pogroms in Ukraine.\n\u201cJews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbors \u2026 even by children,\u201d said the post. \u201cHow is that any different from hating someone for their political views?\u201d\nCarano has said that the message behind the meme was simple: \u201cDo not demonize your neighbor.\u201d In her own naive way, I actually think she believes it.\nBut if I need to explain to you the difference between deadly antisemitic purges and getting into a fight on Facebook with someone whose politics you despise, you probably should not be posting this stuff in the first place. And you deserve the criticism that follows.\nBut do you deserve to lose your livelihood?\nThe social media mob decided that Carano was unfit to be employed and digitally descended on Lucasfilm, and its corporate parent, Walt Disney Co., demanding it #FireGinaCarano. The entertainment giant did just that.\nFormer \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d actor Gina Carano has filed a lawsuit, with the help of Elon Musk, against Disney and Lucasfilm that alleges she was wrongfully terminated and discriminated against when she was fired from the \u201cStar Wars\u201d series.\n\u201cGina Carano is not currently employed by Lucasfilm and there are no plans for her to be in the future,\u201d Lucasfilm said in a statement on Feb. 10, 2021. \u201cNevertheless, her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities are abhorrent and unacceptable.\u201d\nThat\u2019s really not what she did, but that did not stop Disney from canceling a \u201cStar Wars\u201d spinoff series, \u201cRangers of the New Republic,\u201d that she was to star in. Nor did it stop UTA, her talent agency, from dropping her. Nor did it stop Hasbro from scratching the line of action figures that was based on her \u201cMandalorian\u201d character, Cara Dune.\n\u201cI was distraught,\u201d Carano told Glenn Beck last week. She said she briefly lost most of her hearing, as well.\nAnd then, she said, she got an email from a lawyer who works for Elon Musk, the impulsive billionaire who owns X.\nLast year, Musk offered to fund lawsuits for anyone who believes they have been subject to employment discrimination because of their posts.\nCarano, with Musk\u2019s backing, filed her employment- and sex-discrimination lawsuit last week.\n\u2018The Mandalorian\u2019s\u2019 Gina Carano will not be part of future \u2018Star Wars\u2019 projects after Lucasfilm deemed her social media posts \u2018abhorrent and unacceptable.\u2019\n\u201cAfter two highly acclaimed seasons on The Mandalorian as Rebel ranger Cara Dune, Carano was terminated from her role as swiftly as her character\u2019s peaceful home planet of Alderaan had been destroyed by the Death Star in an earlier Star Wars film,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. \u201cAnd all this because she dared voice her own opinions, on social media platforms and elsewhere, and stood up to the online bully mob who demanded her compliance with their extreme progressive ideology.\u201d (Kudos, by the way, to the attorneys who drafted the brief, which is a fun \u2014 if cheesy \u2014 read.)\nCarano, 41, maintains that she was unceremoniously canned because she dared to express her conservative political views on social media. Hard to disagree with that. In a March 2021 call with investors, then-Disney CEO Bob Chapek implied that Carano did not share the company\u2019s values of respect, decency, integrity and inclusion. He didn\u2019t mention free speech, which is ironic since Disney would later accuse Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis of violating the company\u2019s free speech in retaliation for Disney\u2019s opposition to the state\u2019s 2022 \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d legislation.\nIn her posts, Carano has also ridiculed California mask mandates, embraced conspiracy theories about voter fraud and mocked demands by trans activists that she state her preferred pronouns, which, alluding to R2-D2, she declared were \u201cboop/bop/beep.\u201d That is not transphobia; that is refusing to be cowed by people who demand you do something you don\u2019t feel like doing. (I don\u2019t put pronouns on my signature card, either.)\nSocial media posts got her canned from \u2018The Mandalorian\u2019 and the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 universe. Now Gina Carano is back and set to star in a revenge thriller.\nCarano also alleges that she was treated differently from her male co-star, Pedro Pascal, the Mandalorian himself, who once posted a meme conflating former President Trump with Hitler and Nazis, and suffered no blowback, even though, as the lawsuit alleges, \u201csome would find their statements \u2018abhorrent.\u2019 \u201d\nCarano was a celebrated mixed martial arts fighter before being tapped, out of the blue as she has described it, by Steven Soderbergh to star in his 2011 thriller \u201cHaywire\u201d with an A-list cast of co-stars: Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Ewan MacGregor, Channing Tatum and Michael Fassbender.\n\u201cI expect her to become a considerable box-office success,\u201d Roger Ebert wrote in his \u201cHaywire\u201d review, \u201cbecause the fact is, within a limited range, she\u2019s good. She has the no-nonsense beauty of a Noomi Rapace, Linda Fiorentino or Michelle Monaghan.\u201d\nThat Carano\u2019s movie career has been derailed is clear. That it happened because she embraces ideas that are out of step with Hollywood\u2019s liberal orthodoxy is also clear. It\u2019s not fair, but she became a target for rabid \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans and a headache for Lucasfilms \u2014 which is not required to put up with headaches.\nIn 2022, she starred in \u201cTerror on the Prairie,\u201d a movie produced by Ben Shapiro and the Daily Wire as part of the conservative media outfit\u2019s attempt to do battle with, as Shapiro put it, \u201ca culture that despises conservatives.\u201d The movie bombed.\nWith Disney and Lucasfilm, Carano took a stand on principle, and she lost. She is asking for damages, of course. And she also wants her job back. In the end, she traded stardom for a star turn on conservative talk shows. I wonder if she thinks it was worth the price."

      "text": "Inside CBS News: Fear, anger and a silver lining after Paramount-Trump settlement\n- Share via\nFor months, CBS News has been roiled with trepidation that parent company Paramount Global would write a big check to make President Trump\u2019s $20-billion lawsuit go away.\nOn Tuesday night, those fears came true.\nParamount Global agreed to pay $16 million to settle Trump\u2019s legal salvo against \u201c60 Minutes\u201d over the editing of an interview with his 2024 opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\nWithin the news organization, there was anger over what is widely seen as a capitulation to Trump in order to clear a path for Paramount\u2019s $8-billion merger with David Ellison\u2019s Skydance Media. The case was labeled as frivolous by 1st Amendment experts.\nBut among some CBS News veterans, tempers were calmed by a sobering reality: that the outcome could have been worse.\nThe biggest concern inside the news division since Trump\u2019s complaint was that the media company would be strong-armed into making an apology or statement of regret over a case that they believed had no merit. Amid the internal anger over the settlement, there is relief that that did not happen.\n\u201cEverybody knew that was a line in the sand,\u201d said a relieved CBS News veteran not authorized to comment publicly on the matter.\nAnother journalist at the network, speaking on the same condition, said the thinking among many was that any financial payment of less than $20 million without an apology would count as a partial win.\nAs the negotiations to end the suit lingered, it became more apparent that corporate interests overrode any concerns about the appearance of caving to Trump\u2019s demands.\nTrump filed suit in October, claiming \u201c60 Minutes\u201d edited an interview with Harris to make her look better and bolster her chances in the election, which Trump won decisively. CBS denied the claims, saying the edits were routine.\n\u201cIf there wasn\u2019t a merger pending and they took this to court they would have won,\u201d the journalist said of Trump\u2019s case. \u201cI think they understood that if they made an apology they would have an internal rebellion and they would have because there was nothing to apologize for.\u201d\nSome say that the departures of former \u201c60 Minutes\u201d executive producer Bill Owens and CBS News and stations head Wendy McMahon were enough to satisfy the Trump camp\u2019s desire for an apology. Both executives were adamant that CBS News did nothing improper in the handling of the Harris of interview.\nTrump\u2019s legal team claimed victory.\n\u201cPresident Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement.\nBut while \u201c60 Minutes\u201d avoided the humiliation that would have come with a statement of contrition, the program that is the foundation of the news division now has to move forward in an era of media mistrust on the political right and disappointment on the left by those who believe courage is in short supply.\n\u201cCBS Evening News\u201d anchor John Dickerson raised those challenges Wednesday on his streaming program.\n\u201cThe Paramount settlement poses a new obstacle,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cCan you hold power to account after paying it millions? Can an audience trust you when it thinks you\u2019ve traded away that trust? The audience will decide that.\u201d\nAccording to several CBS News insiders who spoke to The Times, no one is expected to depart \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in protest of the settlement decision.\nAndrew Heyward, a former CBS News president who is now a consultant, said it will be up to the new owners of CBS to maintain the program\u2019s journalistic independence.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s jeopardized in the future, that would be unfortunate for CBS News and the country,\u201d he said.\nThough there is anger, many feared a bleak future for the news organization and the rest of the network if Paramount Global couldn\u2019t close the Skydance deal. The lawsuit was seen as an obstacle to the deal, which needs approval from the Federal Communications Commission, run by Trump appointee Brendan Carr.\n\u201cWe can get outraged all we want, but the fact is we were in a really precarious situation,\u201d said one of the journalists not authorized to speak publicly. \u201cIf that merger went dead, I don\u2019t know if anyone would have come along and bought the whole company.\u201d\nThe \u2018Good Morning America\u2019 co-host will remain with the program, which has recently fallen behind NBC\u2019s \u2018Today\u2019 in the ratings.\nWhile ownership change usually generates fear and uncertainty through media organizations, insiders at CBS News say they will be happy to see Paramount Global\u2019s controlling shareholder Shari Redstone in their rearview mirror once the Skydance deal is done.\nThe feelings inside the news division regarding Skydance range from hope for new investment from deep-pocketed Ellison to resignation that \u201cit can\u2019t get any worse.\u201d\nAs for any damage to its reputation, CBS News is taking some comfort in the fact that ABC News hasn\u2019t noticeably suffered from its own $16-million settlement over anchor George Stephanopoulos mistakenly saying Trump was convicted of rape rather than sexual abuse in the civil suit brought by E. Jean Carroll. Stephanopoulos signed a new contract at the network amid the controversy, and his program \u201cGood Morning America\u201d hasn\u2019t suffered a ratings loss since.\nViewers have high expectations for \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which after 57 seasons still ranks as the most-watched news program on television (it\u2019s also the most profitable show on CBS). If the program is allowed to maintain the same standard of deep reporting it\u2019s known for, the audience will get past a bad corporate decision, according to Heyward.\n\u201cPeople on the right will say it\u2019s another example of mainstream media getting what it deserves,\u201d Heyward said. \u201cPeople on the left will say it\u2019s another example of a corporation caving to President Trump for its own selfish interests. And most people will go back to watching \u201960 Minutes\u2019 and expect strong independent reporting without fear or favor \u2014 that\u2019s what really matters.\u201d"

CBS denied the allegations, saying the edits were routine.\nThe unedited footage confirmed that Harris was accurately quoted.\nBut Trump\u2019s team said the edits caused Trump \u201cmental anguish.\u201d After returning to the White House this year, Trump doubled his lawsuit damages demand to $20 billion.\n\u201cHer answer was horrendous,\u201d Trump told reporters last month on the White House lawn. \u201cI would say election-threatening. ... Her answer was election-threatening, it was so incompetent.\u201d\nTwo California Democrats have proposed a hearing to review Paramount Global\u2019s efforts to settle Trump\u2019s $20-billion lawsuit. \u2018I haven\u2019t seen a president act in this brazen of a manner,\u2019 said state Sen. Josh Becker (D-Menlo Park).\nTrump\u2019s lawsuit called the edits \u201cmalicious, deceptive, and substantial news distortion calculated to confuse, deceive, and mislead the public.\u201d The trims, the suit alleged, were \u201cpartisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference.\u201d\nCBS has acknowledged editing the interview, which is routine in the news business. Longstanding 1st Amendment interpretations give news producers wide latitude to decide what material to broadcast as long as they don\u2019t distort the information presented to viewers.\nParamount\u2019s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, pushed for a settlement. The Redstone family\u2019s investment firm, which holds the controlling Paramount shares, is juggling more than $400 million in debt and she wanted to facilitate the sale of Paramount, as well as her family\u2019s holding firm, to Skydance.\nFamily members are counting on their portion of the Paramount sale proceeds. A representative has said Redstone recused herself from decisions dealing with Trump\u2019s lawsuit but the mogul had made clear her desire for a settlement.\nThe Redstone family controls 77% of Paramount voting shares.\n\u201cEllison is great. He\u2019ll do a great job with it,\u201d Trump told reporters during a news conference Wednesday on the White House lawn.\nSkydance executives and their private equity partners also agitated for Paramount to end the bickering with Trump to resolve a key headache before the new owners take over.\nParamount, in a statement, said it has treated Trump\u2019s lawsuit \u201ccompletely separate from, and unrelated to, the Skydance transaction and the FCC approval process.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been nearly a year since Redstone and fellow Paramount directors approved Skydance\u2019s two-phased $8-billion deal.\nDavid Ellison, son of tech billionaire Larry Ellison, is eager to run the company that boasts the legendary Melrose Avenue film studio, the Paramount+ streaming service, CBS and cable channels including Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and BET.\nSkydance operations and personnel are expected to be folded into Paramount in the second phase of the transaction.\nThe deal faces one last regulatory hurdle. Paramount must win FCC Chairman Brendan Carr\u2019s consent to transfer more than two dozen CBS station licenses to the Ellisons. FCC approval has been held up for months.\nSkydance and Paramount face an October deadline to finalize the deal or risk its collapse.\nRedstone would then have to come up with hundreds of millions of dollars to satisfy her creditors, including Larry Ellison, giving her another reason to favor a settlement.\nHer willingness to set aside free speech values prompted pushback from journalists. The nonprofit Freedom of the Press Foundation decried Paramount\u2019s decision to cede 1st Amendment freedoms in an effort to advance the Skydance deal. It vowed to sue Paramount if it settled.\nBut the deal\u2019s months-long delay was wearing.\nRedstone separately disclosed in early June that she was being treated for thyroid cancer.\n\u2018They have to get [the deal] approved,\u2019 said Mario Gabelli, a longtime Paramount shareholder. Gabelli and others are eager for a new chapter, but the Skydance deal has turned into a fitful slog.\nThe legal saga began last fall when CBS News invited both Harris and Trump to sit down with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d a campaign season tradition. After initially agreeing, Trump backed out.\nCBS went forward with the Harris piece but got into hot water after the network broadcast two portions of her response to a question by CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker. When he challenged Harris about the Biden administration\u2019s struggles dealing with Israel\u2019s prime minister, Harris gave a three-sentence answer.\nCBS\u2019 Sunday morning show \u201cFace the Nation\u201d aired her first sentence, which was convoluted. The following night, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d ran the second part of her answer, which was forceful and succinct.\nTrump and his supporters cried foul, pointing to the discrepancies.\nTrump takes to his Truth Social platform to criticize \u201860 Minutes\u2019 coverage, which remains relentless despite his legal action against the program.\nThe showdown accelerated a week before the election when Trump filed his lawsuit in Amarillo, Texas. He accused CBS of trying to cover up Harris\u2019 \u201cword salad\u201d to manipulate the results of what was expected to be a tight election.\nTrump won decisively, and CBS sought to have the case dismissed.\nThe network\u2019s lawyers said its journalists were protected by the 1st Amendment. It also argued that the case should be moved from west Texas, where it was heard by a Trump-appointed federal judge. The lawyers sought to get the case moved to a New York court, where CBS and \u201c60 Minutes\u201d are based.\nThe interview in question didn\u2019t mention Texas. In February, Trump added Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas), his former doctor, to the lawsuit as an additional plaintiff. Jackson is a Texas resident.\nTuesday night\u2019s settlement stipulated that Jackson would not receive any money.\nEarlier this year, the Texas judge ordered the two sides to present their cases to a mediator. A retired judge who handles complex litigation began hearing the matter April 30.\nParamount wants to secure the rights to stream \u2018South Park,\u2019 but the deal still hasn\u2019t come to fruition as the Skydance deal is still in limbo.\nThe controversy stabbed at the heart of CBS News and its legacy of fearless broadcast journalism.\nCBS News producers have long maintained they did nothing wrong. Journalists refused to sign any apology, which was long seen as a key demand from Trump and his team.\nInside the company, a pitched battle raged for months.\nIn late April, the executive producer of \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Bill Owens, quit. That prompted longtime CBS newsman Scott Pelley to inform \u201c60 Minutes\u201d viewers the show had faced increased corporate oversight because of Paramount\u2019s desire to win the Trump administration\u2019s approval of the Skydance deal.\n\u201cNone of our stories has been blocked,\u201d Pelley told viewers. \u201cBut Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.\u201d\nSome corporate executives were furious over Pelley\u2019s public statements, insiders have said.\nSince taking over as chairman of the communications agency, Carr has revived news bias complaints and launched probes into diversity initiatives at Comcast and Disney. This month, he blasted NBC\u2019s coverage of the Kilmar Abrego Garcia controversy.\nThe Trump dispute also contributed to the departure of Wendy McMahon, the president of CBS News and Stations. She stepped down under pressure in May.\nThere were other sore points. Redstone, who also serves as the chair of the Paramount board, had also expressed dissatisfaction with CBS News\u2019 coverage of the Israel-Hamas war.\nFallout from the settlement could prompt additional headaches.\nThree left-leaning U.S. senators warned Redstone that Paramount could face allegations of bribery if it wrote a big check to mollify Trump in an effort to facilitate the FCC\u2019s review of the Skydance deal.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Paramount offered Trump $15 million to make the lawsuit go away, but he declined.\nTrump and CBS-owner Paramount Global enter mediation this week. Company leaders are eager to put the Trump lawsuit and \u201860 Minutes\u2019 controversy behind them.\nThe issue became an unexpected pain point in Skydance\u2019s pursuit of FCC approval to take over the CBS licenses.\nEarly this year, the FCC\u2019s Carr opened an inquiry into whether the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d edits constituted \u201cnews distortion\u201d despite a longstanding acknowledgment by the FCC that it had little authority to act on complaints about accuracy or bias of reporters and news networks.\n\u201cThe agency is prohibited by law from engaging in censorship or infringing on First Amendment rights of the press,\u201d FCC said in guidelines posted on its website. \u201cThose protected rights include, but are not limited to, a broadcaster\u2019s selection and presentation of news or commentary.\u201d\nCarr ordered CBS to release the raw footage.\nVideo of the unedited interview confirmed the network\u2019s account. But the footage also revealed that Harris\u2019 jumbled answer was clipped to its most cogent part.\nPresident Trump filed a $10-billion lawsuit alleging CBS deceptively edited the Kamala Harris interview. CBS publicly released the transcripts and footage after turning the material over to the FCC.\n\u201cIt is troubling anytime a news organization settles a suit that was plainly winnable,\u201d RonNell Andersen Jones, a 1st Amendment expert and law professor at the University of Utah, said in an interview earlier this year. \u201cIt represents lost 1st Amendment ground that didn\u2019t have to be ceded.\u201d\nParamount becomes the latest media company to settle, rather than risk incurring the president\u2019s wrath or facing an ugly courtroom confrontation.\nRather than leading Paramount to reclaim its place among industry titans, Redstone\u2019s tenure atop the company has been marred by miscalculations and setbacks.\nWalt Disney Co. in December settled a Trump suit against ABC News and anchor George Stephanopoulos by agreeing to pay $1 million for legal fees and donating another $15 million for Trump\u2019s future presidential library.\nThe resolution came after Stephanopoulos asserted during an on-air interview that a jury had found Trump \u201cliable for rape\u201d in a civil case. Jurors had actually determined Trump was liable for \u201csexual abuse.\u201d\nSome news outlets have fought back, including the Associated Press, which has vigorously defended its reporters\u2019 ability to cover the president.\nGannett\u2019s Des Moines Register and independent pollster J. Ann Selzer also have battled Trump\u2019s legal challenges to an Iowa poll that overstated Harris\u2019 support. The poll was published just days before the election, suggesting Harris was leading in the Hawkeye State, though she lost convincingly.\nThis week, Trump and his fellow plaintiffs moved to have their federal case dismissed.\nThe president revised his claims \u2014 that the poll\u2019s publication amounted to election interference and violated Iowa\u2019s Consumer Fraud Act \u2014 with a new lawsuit in state court.\nAn emboldened president and his allies have launched a vigorous campaign to use levers of government to intimidate an increasingly fragmented and polarized media, experts say."

Gavin Newsom was critical of settlements two Ivy League universities reached with the Trump administration to restore grants, suggesting UCLA would take a different route.\n- On the line is $584 million in federal grant funding that was suspended last week.\n- The federal government pulled the funds after accusing UCLA of tolerating antisemitism.\nGov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday said UC should not bend \u201con their knees\u201d to the president as university leaders negotiate with the Trump administration to restore more than half a billion dollars in frozen UCLA grants amid antisemitism accusations.\nNewsom chided settlements Trump struck with two Ivy League universities. Columbia and Brown agreed to pay hefty fines and make sweeping campus changes in exchange for the restoration of research money that was also canceled over Trump antisemitism allegations. Harvard too is negotiating with the government over similar charges.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not Brown, we\u2019re not Columbia, and I\u2019m not going to be governor if we act like that,\u201d Newsom said, referring to settlements the universities announced last month. \u201cPeriod. Full stop, I will fight like hell to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nColumbia\u2019s and Brown\u2019s agreements included highly criticized payouts. Columbia will pay more than $200 million to the federal government and Brown will pay $50 million to Rhode Island workforce programs \u2014 in addition to promises to share admissions data with federal authorities. The Trump administration has accused elite universities, including UCLA, of illegally considering a person\u2019s race when deciding whom to admit.\nTwo years after the Supreme Court ruled against affirmative action, President Trump wants colleges to prove they do not consider race in admissions.\nColumbia also agreed to review its Middle Eastern studies programs and submit to an outside monitor to oversee whether it was following the settlement. Faculty have accused the university\u2019s leaders of relenting on coveted higher education values of academic freedom independent of government or political influence.\nThe remarks from Newsom were his first public comments about how UC should proceed with Trump, and the first indication \u2014 if vague \u2014 of how a UC settlement with Trump may or may not look.\nThe university system, run by its president and Board of Regents, is independent under the state Constitution of \u201call political or sectarian influence.\u201d At at the same time, the governor can exercise political sway over the regents, whose members he appoints. Newsom also holds an ex-officio seat on the board.\nNewsom, speaking in San Francisco, made the remarks during a media question-and-answer period after an event about artificial intelligence workforce partnerships the state announced with Google, Adobe, IBM and Microsoft.\n\u201cThere\u2019s principles. There\u2019s right and wrong, and we\u2019ll do the right thing. This is about our competitiveness. It\u2019s about the fate and future of this country. It\u2019s about our sovereignty. It\u2019s about so much more than the temperament of an aggrieved individual who happens to currently be president of the United States,\u201d Newsom said.\nAsked about UC\u2019s negotiations, Newsom said, \u201cThey\u2019ll do the right thing.\u201d\n\u201cI have the confidence and I\u2019ll do everything in my power to encourage them to do the right thing and not to become another law firm that bends on their knees, another company that sells their soul or another institution that takes a shortcut and takes the easy wrong versus the hard right.\u201d\nUC and UCLA spokespeople did not immediately respond Thursday to a question about Newsom\u2019s comments.\nUCLA and University of California officials said Monday that it will negotiate with Trump over $339 million in medical and science grant freezes.\nUC President James B. Milliken said Wednesday that the university system was \u201cagreeing to engage in dialogue with the federal administration\u201d after the Department of Justice sent a letter to UC last week saying it found UCLA had violated the civil rights of Jewish students after activists erected a pro-Palestinian encampment in April 2024.\nMilliken said the the goal of negotiations was for all \u201csuspended and at-risk federal funding restored to the university as soon as possible.\u201d\nThe grant suspensions affect research into areas including neuroscience, clean energy and cancer. The Justice Department and U.S. Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi said on July 28 that UCLA would pay a \u201cheavy price\u201d for acting with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to the civil rights of Jewish and Israeli students who complained of antisemitic incidents since Oct. 7, 2023. The date marks when Hamas attacked Israel, which led to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza.\nIn his Wednesday statement, Milliken said that the cuts \u201cdo nothing to address antisemitism. Moreover, the extensive work that UCLA and the entire University of California have taken to combat antisemitism has apparently been ignored. The announced cuts would be a death knell for innovative work that saves lives, grows our economy, and fortifies our national security. It is in our country\u2019s best interest that funding be restored.\u201d\nIn a campuswide letter Wednesday, UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk said the grant suspensions were \u201cdevastating for UCLA and for Americans across the nation.\u201d\nTimes staff writer Taryn Luna contributed to this report."

Jean Carroll.\nAccording to settlement documents made public Saturday, ABC will also post a note on its website expressing regret over the claim in a March 10 segment on Stephanopoulos\u2019 \u201cThis Week\u201d program and pay $1 million in legal fees to Trump\u2019s lawyer.\nStephanopoulos said during his interview with Rep.

Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) that Trump had been \u201cfound liable for rape,\u201d which misstated the verdicts in Carroll\u2019s two lawsuits against him.\nLast year, Trump was found liable for sexually assaulting and defaming Carroll and was ordered to pay her $5 million. In January, he was found liable on additional defamation claims and ordered to pay Carroll $83.3 million. Trump is appealing both verdicts.\nNeither verdict involved a finding of rape as defined under New York law.\nThe judge in both cases, Lewis Kaplan, has said that the jury\u2019s conclusion was that Carroll had failed to prove that Trump raped her \u201cwithin the narrow, technical meaning of a particular section of the New York Penal Law.\u201d\nKaplan noted that the definition of rape was \u201cfar narrower\u201d than how rape is defined in common modern parlance, in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes, and elsewhere.\nThe judge said the verdict did not mean that Carroll \u201cfailed to prove that Mr. Trump \u2018raped\u2019 her as many people commonly understand the word \u2018rape.\u2019 Indeed ... the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.\u201d"
