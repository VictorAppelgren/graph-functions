  "content": "Apple will unveil its new iPhone 17 lineup on September 9 in a range of new colors. Below, we've collated all the rumored colors for the regular iPhone 17, the all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, the \u200ciPhone 17 Pro\u200c, and the larger \u200ciPhone 17\u200c Pro Max.\n\nLast year, Apple chose soft, pastel-inspired finishes for its iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models. They are available in ultramarine, teal, pink, white, and black. The yellow that the iPhone 15 comes in is notably missing, having been replaced by the darker blue hue of the ultramarine. Together, the iPhone 16 colors appear more saturated and vivid \u2013 pink and ultramarine especially show a bolder, more confident hue compared to the pastel washes of the iPhone 15.\n\nFor the regular iPhone 17, Apple is rumored to be offering the following colors.\n\nBlack and White remain as classic color options, complemented by four new options, including a Steel Gray twist on Space Gray:\n\nThese colors came from an \"internal document\" obtained by Macworld. Many have also been rumored by leakers \"Majin Bu\" and Sonny Dickson.\n\n\n\nWith the 2025 iPhone launch, Apple will introduce an ultra thin \"iPhone 17 Air,\" marking the first notable redesign to the iPhone's form factor in several years. The device will replace the Plus model in Apple's iPhone 17 lineup. iPhone 17 Air is just a placeholder name, and we don't know what Apple will call the new device, but multiple rumors have confirmed Apple's work on a super thin iPhone.\n\n\n\n\n\nApple plans to offer the iPhone 17 Air in four colors, including black, silver, light gold, and light blue, according to leaker Majin Bu. Macworld has also independently corroborated the four colors.\n\nIt's not clear if light gold will be Apple's actual marketing name for this color, but light blue is thought to be a re-emergence of Sky Blue, the same color that debuted on the latest M4 MacBook Air models Apple released in March.\n\nThe new lighter blue color option for the device was first mentioned by Weibo leaker \"Fixed Focus Digital,\" who suggests that this blue shade will be central to Apple's marketing for the new device. Described as significantly lighter than any previous blue Apple has released, the color may appear almost white in low-light conditions. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has also independently confirmed the light blue color.\n\nThe finish is said to echo Apple's past use of lighter tones, particularly the iPhone 13 Pro's \"Sierra Blue.\" That color marked a shift toward more subtle, pastel-like shades \u2013 metallic and icy, it shifted between blue and light gray depending on the lighting. Apple continued this trend with the softer, pastel finishes introduced in the iPhone 15 lineup.\n\nMajin Bu has said that it \"looks even more stunning than the much-loved Sierra Blue of the iPhone 13 Pro, with a brightness and refinement that make it irresistible.\"\n\nThe Sky Blue finish on the MacBook Air is not very saturated, and the color's appearance can vary based on lighting conditions. Apple describes it as \"a beautiful, metallic light blue that creates a dynamic gradient when light reflects off of its surface.\"\n\nApple has stuck with muted colors for its recent iPhone \"Pro\" models made from titanium. For the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple offered a new Desert Titanium color. The iPhone 16 Pro also comes in Natural Titanium, White Titanium, and Black Titanium.\n\nThis year, however, iPhone 17 Pro models are rumored to have an aluminum frame instead of titanium. The back of the devices will also reportedly have a new \"part-aluminum, part-glass\" design. This could potentially usher in all-new color choices for Apple's high-end iPhone 17 models. And so far, we have heard rumors of at least two.\n\n\n\n\n\nApple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models will have a new copper-like orange color option, according to accessory specialist and occasional leaker Sonny Dickson. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has also independently confirmed the new color.\n\nDickson has shared images of alleged lens covers for the rear cameras on the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max models, with five color labels. Macworld has independently corroborated the colors:\n\nApple is seemingly sticking with some familiar finishes for the iPhone 16 Pro lineup: the black, gray, and silver colors probably match the current Black Titanium, Natural Titanium, and White Titanium options. However, a dark blue lens cover hints at the possible return of Blue Titanium, last seen with the iPhone 15 Pro.\n\nThe standout though is the orange lens cover, which may signal the debut of a completely new copper-like finish \u2013 an option Apple has never offered on any iPhone before.\n\u2022 iPhone 17 Release Date, Pre-Orders, and What to Expect\n\nWhat do you think of the color options in this year's iPhone 17 series? Let us know in the comments.",

      "text": "iPhone 17 Pro Models Rumored to Feature Aluminum Frame Instead of Titanium Frame\nOver the years, Apple has switched from an aluminum frame to a stainless steel frame to a titanium frame for its highest-end iPhones. And now, it has been rumored that Apple will go back to using aluminum for three out of four iPhone 17 models.\nIn an investor note with research firm GF Securities, obtained by MacRumors this week, Apple supply chain analyst Jeff Pu said the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all be equipped with aluminum frames. Interestingly, though, he expects Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air model to have a titanium frame.\nThis would be a notable change for the Pro models, as all of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro models have titanium frames, resulting in the devices weighing less than iPhone 14 Pro models with heavier stainless steel frames.\nAluminum frames were already rumored for the iPhone 17 Pro models once before.\nPu said Apple plans to use aluminum for the iPhone 17 Pro models due to environmental considerations. Aluminum generally has a lower carbon footprint compared to titanium, and Apple is aiming to achieve carbon neutrality for all of its products and supply chain by 2030. Following in the footsteps of the Apple Watch, and the latest Mac mini, perhaps some iPhone 17 models will be advertised as Apple's first carbon-neutral iPhones.\nIt is unclear why the iPhone 17 Air would have a titanium frame, as aluminum is lighter than titanium, which would be fitting for the device's thin and light design. We may have a partial explanation, though. Last year, fellow Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the iPhone 17 Air's frame would use a mix of titanium and aluminum, with a lower amount of titanium compared to the iPhone 15 Pro models. Apple surely has its reasons here, so hopefully we will find out more details before the iPhone 17 series is unveiled in September.\nPopular Stories\nAn iPhone 17 announcement is a dead cert for September 2025 \u2013 Apple has already sent out invites for an \"Awe dropping\" event on Tuesday, September 9 at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California.

      "text": "Apple's iPhone 17 Pro Models\nContents\nOn September 9, Apple will introduce the iPhone 17 Pro and the iPhone 17 Pro Max, two new high-end flagship devices that will be sold alongside the iPhone 17 and the all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 \"Air\" that's replacing the iPhone 17 Plus.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models will get a refreshed design for the rear casing and the camera area. Rumors suggest Apple could go with a part glass, part aluminum build, which would increase durability. The glass would allow wireless charging to continue to be available, but a partial aluminum frame would be less prone to breakage.\nWe're also expecting an update to the rear camera, with some rumors suggesting Apple is working on a horizontal camera bump that would be a major deviation from the current square-shaped camera arrangement. With this setup, there would be a centered, horizontal camera bump at the back of the iPhone, with the three lenses arranged in either a horizontal orientation or the standard triangle orientation, just with a larger bump.\n120Hz ProMotion refresh rates are rumored for all models, so better refresh rates may no longer be a Pro iPhone exclusive Apple is also rumored to be adding a more resilient anti-reflective display that's able to better hold up against drops and scratches.\nThere won't be size changes, because Apple increased the size of the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max last year, and there are no rumors of an updated size. The iPhone 17 Pro will continue to measure in at 6.3 inches, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max will be 6.9 inches.\nApple is developing new A-series chips for the iPhone 17 Pro models, built on the latest 3-nanometer node. We could see some improvements to efficiency and performance, with Apple set to use A19 Pro chips for the higher-end 2025 iPhones.\nThis roundup focuses on the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. For an overview of all iPhone 17 models, we have a separate iPhone 17 roundup, and we also have specifics on the super thin iPhone 17 Air in that roundup.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\nDesign\nThere will be two models, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. Apple increased the size of the Pro lineup last year, and we're expecting those same screen sizes with no further changes in 2025. The iPhone 17 Pro will measure in at 6.3 inches, while the iPhone 17 Pro Max will measure in at 6.9 inches. Overall size isn't going to change, but rumors suggest we could see some \"significant\" design updates, specifically to the rear of the device.\nApple could eliminate the titanium frame that it's used for the last several years, instead transitioning back to using aluminum. The iPhone 17 Pro models might have an aluminum frame and a back that's half glass and half aluminum instead of all glass. The half-and-half design would improve durability at the top where there's aluminum, while still allowing for wireless charging with the glass at the bottom.\nWhile some rumors have said the iPhone 17 Pro will have a two-tone design with a camera bump that's a different color than the rest of the device, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman says that the camera area will be the same color as the rest of the iPhone, the same as the iPhone 16 models are now.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro could be thicker in order to accommodate a larger battery, with the thickness coming in at 8.725mm, up from 8.25mm.\nRumors suggest that Apple might redesign the camera bump. Rather than a square bump, Apple could adopt a larger \"rectangular\" camera bump that's made from aluminum instead of glass and that spans across the back of the device. A horizontal camera bump would be a major design change, and suggests that the lenses of the camera would be arranged horizontally.\nThere is said to be a \"glass section\" around the logo that's integrated into an \"overall metal chassis,\" which has previously been described as a half aluminum, half glass build. The glass section of the iPhone will accommodate wireless charging, while the rest could be made from aluminum to improve durability.\niPhone 17 Pro dummy models and CAD Renders have an outlined area on the back that ranges from the camera module to the bottom of the chassis, mirroring the rumored half aluminum, half glass design that we've heard about.\nA leaked iPhone 17 Pro aluminum chassis features an area for the camera bump, confirming that the next-generation iPhone will a sturdier build that won't break as readily as glass.\nLeaked iPhone 17 Pro cases provide a look at just how large the rear camera bump might be. There is an oversized rectangular cutout that spans the entire back of the case.\nA test version of the iPhone 17 Pro may have been spotted in the wild, with the device confirming the updated rear camera design.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro could have a new antenna design that wraps around the rear camera bump, possibly providing improved 5G, LTE, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth connectivity compared to prior-generation models. There may also be fewer antenna lines.\nColors\nLeaked iPhone 17 Pro components suggest that the iPhone 17 Pro models could be available in a copper-like orange color, along with black, gray, silver, and a dark blue shade. If the parts are accurate, these could be the colors that Apple will offer.\nOne leaker has suggested that one of the iPhone 17 Pro colors could somehow reflect the Liquid Glass design language in the iOS 26 update. Instant Digital said that there is a \"special\" color that is \"connected to the iOS 26 Liquid Glass design.\nThe leaker believes that the color that prior leaks refer to as white actually looks different depending on the light, perhaps with more of an iridescent look.\nMagSafe\nApple may relocate the Apple logo on the back of the iPhone 17 Pro models, possibly because of the redesigned camera module. Rumors suggest that Apple will move the logo lower on the device, and it could be located inside a break in the MagSafe ring.\nTo accommodate the relocated logo, Apple may also tweak the MagSafe magnet layout compared to existing iPhone models. Leaked images of the alleged iPhone 17 Pro magnet array feature a design with an open bottom for the Apple logo.\niPhone 17 Cases\nApple is rumored to be designing new \"TechWoven\" fabric-style cases for the iPhone 17 lineup. The cases are said to offer enhanced durability compared to the prior FineWoven cases that Apple used to sell.\nThe iPhone cases appear to have small holes at the bottom corners that would accommodate a lanyard or a crossbody strap. They are said to have metallic buttons with \"improved tactile feedback,\" a Camera Control button, and MagSafe compatibility.\nThe cases could come in colors that include black, green, blue, purple, and orange.\nApple is also supposedly going to offer a crossbody strap that features a unique magnetic attachment system.\nDisplay\nAll iPhone 17 models could get 120Hz ProMotion technology in 2025, which would mean ProMotion would no longer be a Pro-only feature.\nWhile multiple rumors have suggested ProMotion display capabilities will expand to the entire iPhone 17 lineup, a Chinese leaker believes that's partially inaccurate. The leaker says that the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air will get 120Hz displays, but that the displays will not support adaptive refresh rates down to 1Hz.\nA 120Hz panel would allow for smoother scrolling, animations, and UI transitions, but it would not allow for always-on display functionality.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models were going to be updated with a scratch resistant anti-reflective display coating, but it sounds like that might not happen this year after all. Apple ran into issues scaling up its display coating process, and it was too slow when taking into account millions of devices, so the coating plan was scrapped.\nThere have been mixed rumors about the size of the Dynamic Island. Analyst Jeff Pu claims that Apple is using metalens technology for Face ID that will allow for a narrower Dynamic Island across the iPhone 17 lineup, but Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo does not expect notable changes to the Dynamic Island and he believes it will be the same size.\nA-Series Chip\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models will adopt Apple's next-generation A19 Pro chip. The A19 Pro will be built on an upgraded N3P 3-nanometer process that should bring modest efficiency and speed improvements compared to the A18 Pro.\nRAM\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to have 12GB RAM, up from 8GB in the iPhone 16 Pro models.\nThermal Improvements\nThe iPhone 17 Pro could use a vapor chamber cooling technology for improved thermal performance. Vapor chamber technology disperses heat across a larger surface area to prevent thermal throttling and to keep performance stable, and it could be a benefit for Apple's high-powered A19 chip.\nA copper thermal plate said to be for the vapor cooling system surfaced in June.\nCamera\nAll four 2025 iPhone models are rumored to have an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera, which is an improvement over the 12-megapixel front-facing camera in the iPhone 16 models. The camera will notably improve image quality, and allow for more cropping in without a loss of quality.\nApple is expected to upgrade the Telephoto lens to 48 megapixels, a major improvement over the current 12-megapixel Telephoto lens. The iPhone 17 Pro models will be the first iPhones with three 48-megapixel lenses, as the Wide and Ultra Wide lenses have already been upgraded to 48 megapixels.\nOne leaker has suggested the new 48-megapixel Telephoto lens will offer 3.5x optical zoom (85mm equivalent) instead of the 5x zoom (120mm equivalent) that is currently available. 3.5x optical zoom could be better suited for portraits, and the higher resolution allows for more cropping in, allowing Apple to also simulate 5x optical zoom. Apple already uses this method for the Fusion camera in the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, as the Wide lens enables a 2x digital crop that is the only \"telephoto\" option for Apple's more affordable iPhones.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro could support shooting 8K video, up from the current 4K recording maximum.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models might offer dual video recording, a feature that would allow users to record video with the front and rear cameras simultaneously. Some apps already support this functionality, which is useful for content creators, but the built-in camera does not.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro's Wide camera could have a mechanical aperture that lets users adjust the size of the aperture to tweak the amount of light that reaches the lens. Current iPhones have fixed apertures, but a variable aperture will allow for more control over the depth of field.\nOne tipster claims that the iPhone 17 Pro will feature a Telephoto lens that supports up to 8x optical zoom, up from 5x optical zoom on the 16 Pro models. There may also be a second Camera Control button for accessing camera settings.\nIt's possible that some feature of the Telephoto lens will be exclusive to the iPhone 17 Pro Max. The Telephoto lens is supposed to get upgraded to 48 megapixels, and there are rumors that the lens might be able to switch from 5x zoom to 8x zoom.\nThe 5x to 8x zoom could possibly be limited to the iPhone 17 Pro Max because a moving lens like that requires more internal space.\nBattery and Charging\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max could have Apple's biggest iPhone battery to date, with a battery capacity of 5,000mAh. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 4,676mAh battery, so the 17 Pro Max could last longer than the 33 hour maximum that the 16 Pro Max features. The A19 Pro and new Qualcomm Snapdragon X80 modem could also increase battery life.\nWith the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, Apple introduced a new battery adhesive that can be loosened with a low-voltage electrical current, making the batteries easier to remove and replace. That same technology could be used in the iPhone 17 Pro models this year.\nThe upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models might have a reverse wireless charging feature that allows them to wirelessly charge the AirPods and Apple Watch. Apple supposedly tested reverse wireless charging for the iPhone 17 Pro models, but it's not yet clear if it will be in the final version of the device.\nThe iPhone 17 models are expected to support 25W wireless charging with third-party wireless chargers that support the next-generation Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard. Right now, iPhones are limited to 15W wireless charging with third-party chargers, but the new Qi standard supports up to 25W charging.\nAn image of the alleged iPhone 17 Pro battery suggests it will have a metal cover and a slight L-shape. Apple could also use the removable adhesive that it used for the standard iPhone 16 models, which would make repair simpler.\nConnectivity\nWhile the iPhone 17 Air will have Apple's C1 5G modem, the iPhone 17 Pro models will continue to use 5G modems from Qualcomm. Qualcomm modems support both 6GHz and mmWave 5G, while the C1 is limited to 6GHz 5G.\nAll four iPhone 17 models that are coming in 2025 will have Apple's first custom-designed Wi-Fi chip with Wi-Fi 7 support. Wi-Fi 7 is already used in the iPhone 16 models, but Apple's chip design could bring additional efficiency and connectivity improvements, and it paves the way for a future all-in-one SoC.\nApple is aiming to create a wireless setup where the components are tightly integrated and more energy efficient, which will let the company cut down on the battery use of cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth technologies.\nWi-Fi 7 supports data transmission over 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz band simultaneously for faster speeds and lower latency with a supported router. Wi-Fi 7 supports peak speeds of more than 40Gb/s. Bluetooth 5.3 is also expected.\niPhone 17 Ultra?\nOne rumor has suggested the largest of Apple's iPhones in 2025 will be called the \"iPhone 17 Ultra\" instead of \"iPhone 17 Pro Max,\" but this is a rumor that we've heard twice before during the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 rumor cycles, so there is a good chance that this information is not accurate.\nPricing\nThe iPhone 17 models could see a price hike, as Apple's component costs are increasing due to tariffs. Apple will pair the potential price increase with new features and camera design changes to justify the price to consumers, rather than blaming tariffs.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro could be $50 more expensive than the prior-generation iPhone 16 Pro, but it might start with 256GB of storage rather than 128GB of storage, which would raise the price.\nLaunch Date\nApple is holding an \"Awe Dropping\" iPhone-centric event on Tuesday, September 9 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. The iPhone 17 Pro models will debut at the event. Pre-orders are likely to follow on Friday, September 12, and a launch could happen on Friday, September 19.\nWhat's Next for the iPhone Lineup\nStarting in 2026, Apple will split its iPhone lineup between fall and spring launches. The iPhone 18 Air, iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and a foldable iPhone will launch in the second half of 2026, while the standard iPhone 18 and the iPhone 18e won't launch until spring 2027.\nThe iPhone 18 Pro models that are coming in 2026 could have under-display Face ID, which would cut down on the size of the Dynamic Island. There might just be a single camera hole for the front-facing camera, with the camera cutout located in the top left corner. Later, in 2027, Apple could release an iPhone with an all-screen design, featuring an edge-to-edge display with no cutouts. Apple is essentially planning iPhone design updates every year through 2027.\nApple's first foldable iPhone is expected in fall 2026, and rumors suggest it will launch alongside the iPhone 18 Air and iPhone 18 Pro models. It is expected to have a \"nearly invisible\" crease when it's folded, thanks to a high-quality hinge.\nMore on the iPhone 18 lineup with Apple's first foldable iPhone can be found in our dedicated iPhone 18 roundup."

      "text": "The 2025 iPhone 17 Air\nContents\nWith the September 9 iPhone event, Apple will introduce an ultra thin \"iPhone 17 Air,\" marking the first notable redesign to the iPhone's form factor in several years. iPhone 17 Air is just a placeholder name, and we don't know what Apple will call the new device, but multiple rumors have confirmed Apple's work on a super thin iPhone.\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to be around 5.5mm thick, and at 5.5mm, it will be the thinnest iPhone released to date. That measurement doesn't include the area with the camera bump, which could be thicker to accommodate the single 48-megapixel rear camera rumored for the device.\nApple will sell the iPhone 17 Air alongside the standard iPhone 17, the iPhone 17 Pro, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max. We are not expecting an iPhone 17 Plus this year, with the iPhone 17 Air effectively replacing it in the lineup. Early rumors suggested the iPhone 17 Air could be as expensive or more expensive than the iPhone 17 Pro, but more recent information suggests it will cost more than the iPhone 17 but won't be as expensive as the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. That suggests we could see a price point around $899, similar to the current iPhone 16 Plus.\nIn terms of size, rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Air will have a 6.6-inch display, which will put it in between the iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Pro Max in size. As mentioned, it will have a single-lens rear camera, and Apple could be planning for a horizontal bar-like camera bump at the back, a design feature that's also rumored for the Pro iPhones.\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to feature a 120Hz ProMotion display, and it will be equipped with Apple's C1 5G modem. Other features will include an A19 chip, Wi-Fi 7, and a more advanced display material that can better hold up to drops and scratches. There will be some small design changes to accommodate the device's thin chassis, such as a USB-C port that's not entirely centered, and fewer speaker holes.\nApple plans to market the iPhone 17 Air with a focus on design rather than internal specs. It won't have the top-of-the-line components or the fastest chip like the iPhone 17 Pro models, but the fresh design may be appealing to customers.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\nDesign\nWith the 2024 iPad Pro launch, Apple slimmed down the chassis, and the 12.9-inch model is just 5.1mm thick. It's Apple's thinnest device ever, and now Apple is aiming to follow it up with a super thin and light iPhone.\nWe've heard several rumors about the iPhone 17 Air, and thickness estimates have ranged from 5mm to a little over 6mm. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, for example, thinks that the iPhone 17 Air will be around two millimeters thinner than the iPhone 16 Pro.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is 8.25mm thick, so an iPhone 17 that's 2mm thinner would come in at around 6.25mm. 6.25mm would make the iPhone 17 Air the thinnest iPhone to date, but some rumors think it will be even thinner.\nThe Information believes the iPhone 17 Air will be around 6mm thick, while Jeff Pu thinks it will be 6mm thick. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the iPhone 17 Air will be 5.5mm thick at its thinnest point, which likely means it will have a 5.5mm chassis with a thicker area for the rear camera bump. Dummy models that have surfaced are approximately 5.5mm thick.\nThe thinnest iPhone to date was the iPhone 6, which measured in at 6.9mm. iPhones got thicker with the iPhone X and beyond, because Apple changed device thickness to provide more space for the battery, camera lenses, Face ID hardware, and more. The iPhone 17 Air could be 9.5mm thick at the camera bump end, which means we can expect the camera bump to be notably thicker than the rest of the device.\nApple might use a titanium-aluminum frame for the iPhone 17 Air, with the device using more titanium than the current Pro iPhones. Rumors suggest that the iPhone 17 Air will weigh in at 145 grams. That would make it similar in weight to the iPhone SE 2 or the iPhone 13 mini, which are 148 grams and 141 grams, respectively. Titanium could help ensure that the iPhone frame resists bending while also keeping the device lightweight.\nConceptual renderings of the iPhone 17 Air provide insight into what the device is expected to look like. Mockups, renders, and dummy models feature a device with a slim, 5.5mm profile and a thicker rear camera bar with single-lens camera. Apple hasn't implemented a horizontal camera bar before, so this will be a significant design change. The iPhone 17 Pro models are also expected to have a camera bar.\nThe iPhone 17 Air will have a 6.6-inch display, which Apple chose because it was worried anything larger might be susceptible to bending. Apple initially planned on a 6.9-inch screen size for the device, but it was sized down to prevent any potential bending issues.\nRumors suggest the iPhone 17 Air will feature a \"glass section\" around the logo that's integrated into an \"overall metal chassis,\" which has previously been described as a half aluminum, half glass build. The design can be seen in some renderings and iPhone 17 Air dummy models.\nThe iPhone 17 Air will have some subtle design changes so that all of the internal components can fit despite the thinness of the chassis. Dummy models suggest that the USB-C port on the bottom edge won't be centered front to back, and will instead be shifted closer to the rear of the device.\nThe speaker grilles have also been simplified, with just two holes on either side of the port rather than the typical five.\nThe iPhone 17 Air will include MagSafe charging, a Camera Control button, and an Action Button, based on dummy models of the device that have been circulating.\nA closer look at the thin design of the iPhone 17 Air can be seen in a video that shows off an iPhone 17 Air dummy model. Dummy models are often an accurate representation of what we can expect, as they are created for case makers based on leaked information from Apple's suppliers.\nA screen protector designed for the iPhone 17 Air based on leaked design dimensions suggests that the front camera of the device might be located on the left of the Dynamic Island, rather than on the right like the iPhone 16 models.\nColors\nThe iPhone 17 Air could be available in black, white, light gold, and light blue. The blue shade is rumored to be a very light blue similar to the blue that Apple used for the MacBook Air.\niPhone 17 Cases\nApple is rumored to be designing new \"TechWoven\" fabric-style cases for the iPhone 17 lineup. The cases are said to offer enhanced durability compared to the prior FineWoven cases that Apple used to sell.\nThe iPhone cases appear to have small holes at the bottom corners that would accommodate a lanyard or a crossbody strap. They are said to have metallic buttons with \"improved tactile feedback,\" a Camera Control button, and MagSafe compatibility.\nThe cases could come in colors that include black, green, blue, purple, and orange.\nApple has considered creating a bumper case designed for the iPhone 17 Air. The case would feature protection for the edges of the device, but would not cover the back. Apple last released a bumper case alongside the iPhone 4 in 2010. For the iPhone 17 Air, a bumper case would offer some protection without impacting the thin design of the device.\nApple is also supposedly going to offer a crossbody strap that features a unique magnetic attachment system.\nDisplay\nThe iPhone 17 Air is rumored to have a 6.6-inch display, which means it will be larger than the iPhone 17 but smaller than the iPhone 17 Pro Max. There have been mixed rumors about the size of the Dynamic Island. Analyst Jeff Pu claims that Apple is using metalens technology for Face ID that will allow for a narrower Dynamic Island, but Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo does not expect notable changes to the Dynamic Island and he believes it will be the same size.\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to use the same OLED panel as the current iPhone 16 Pro models, which is sourced from Samsung. The panel has a 30 percent increase in brightness and improved longevity compared to the prior-generation iPhone 16 display.\nThe entire iPhone 17 lineup is could get 120Hz ProMotion display technology, which means it will no longer be a feature limited to the Pro lineup. ProMotion displays will be enabled by the low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) panels that Apple plans to use for all of the iPhone 17 models. LTPO allows for 1Hz to 120Hz refresh rates, and adds always-on display support.\nWhile multiple rumors have suggested ProMotion display capabilities will expand to the entire iPhone 17 lineup, a Chinese leaker believes that's partially inaccurate. The leaker says that the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air will get 120Hz displays, but that the displays will not support adaptive refresh rates down to 1Hz.\nA 120Hz panel would allow for smoother scrolling, animations, and UI transitions, but it would not allow for always-on display functionality.\nThere were rumors that some iPhone 17 models were going to be updated with a scratch resistant anti-reflective display coating, but it sounds like that might not happen this year after all. Apple ran into issues scaling up its display coating process, and it was too slow when taking into account millions of devices, so the coating plan was scrapped.\nHints of the iPhone 17 Air were found in the iOS 26 beta. There is a wallpaper for a display that has a 1260 x 2736 resolution, but that doesn't correspond to any existing iPhone models. It is, however, a resolution that would work for a 6.6-inch display.\nNaming\nWe don't know what Apple is going to call its ultra thin iPhone. Rumors have referred to it as the \"iPhone 17 Slim\" or the \"iPhone 17 Air,\" but neither name is official.\nGiven that Apple has an iPad Air and an iPad Pro and a MacBook Air and a MacBook Pro, the iPhone \"Air\" naming might make the most sense to Apple customers.\nA-Series Chip\nApple is working on A19 and A19 Pro chips for the iPhone 17 lineup, and the iPhone 17 Air will get one of those two options. Some rumors suggest it will get the A19 alongside the iPhone 17, but it could also feature the A19 Pro with one fewer GPU core than the A19 Pro used in the iPhone 17 Pro.\nRumors suggest that all iPhone 17 models will have a vapor chamber heatsink to improve thermal performance. Vapor chambers work by spreading headtevenly across a larger area, reducing thermal throttling and ensuring consistent performance.\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to have 12GB RAM, which would put it on par with the iPhone 17 Pro models. Current iPhone 16 models have 8GB RAM, the minimum for Apple Intelligence.\nCamera\nWith limited internal space due to the slimmed down design, the iPhone 17 Air will get just a single-lens rear camera. Rumors suggest it will use the same 48-megapixel Wide camera that's in the iPhone 16 models. If the iPhone 17 Air only has a single-lens rear camera, it will not be capable of capturing spatial video or spatial photos unless Apple has a new technique in mind for capturing this kind of content.\nAll iPhone models coming in 2025 are rumored to have an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera, which is an improvement over the 12-megapixel front-facing camera in the iPhone 16 models. The camera will notably improve image quality, and allow for more cropping in without a loss of quality.\nConnectivity\nApple-Designed 5G Modem Chip\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to be one of the first iPhones that will use an Apple-designed 5G modem chip. Apple's modem will be capable of theoretical 5G download speeds of up to 4Gb/s, which is slower than Qualcomm modems in current iPhones. The chip also won't support the fastest mmWave 5G, and it will be limited to sub-6GHz speeds.\nFor other iPhone 17 models, Apple plans to continue to use Qualcomm chips. It's just the iPhone 17 Air that will get the Apple chip.\nSIM Tray\nApple will remove the physical SIM slot in iPhones sold in more countries next year, though it is not yet clear which countries. U.S. iPhone models haven't included a SIM tray since the iPhone 14, but Apple has continued using it in other countries.\nThe iPhone 17 Air may be too thin to support a SIM tray.\nBluetooth and Wi-Fi\nAll four iPhone 17 models that are coming in 2025 will have Apple's first custom-designed Wi-Fi chip with Wi-Fi 7 support. Wi-Fi 7 is already used in the iPhone 16 models, but Apple's chip design could bring additional efficiency and connectivity improvements, and it paves the way for a future all-in-one SoC.\nApple is aiming to create a wireless setup where the components are tightly integrated and more energy efficient, which will let the company cut down on the battery use of cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth technologies.\nWi-Fi 7 supports data transmission over 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz band simultaneously for faster speeds and lower latency with a supported router. Wi-Fi 7 supports peak speeds of more than 40Gb/s. Bluetooth 5.3 is also expected.\nBattery\nWith the iPhone Air featuring a chassis that's just 5.5mm thick, there will be less room for the battery. Apple is optimizing battery life with the more efficient C1 modem, processor improvements, and a higher-density battery that could use silicon-anode battery technology, but there could still be a hit to battery life.\nAccording to The Information, the iPhone 17 Air will have \"worse\" battery life compared to other iPhones. Apple's internal testing has apparently found that 60 to 70 percent of iPhone 17 Air users will be able to go a full day without charging, while that number is 80 to 90 percent for other iPhone models.\nThe iPhone 17 Air could have a 2,800mAh battery, which would be similar to the battery that Apple used in the iPhone 12. A second rumor says the battery will be under 3,000mAh, and a third suggests Apple will use a 2,900mAh battery.\nAlleged images of the iPhone 17 Air's battery suggest that it will be half as thin as the battery designed for the iPhone 17 Pro. It supposedly measures in at 2.49mm thick, which would take up just under half the thickness of the device if the iPhone 17 Air is 5.5mm thick as rumored.\nCharging\nApple is planning to release an iPhone battery case alongside the iPhone 17 Air that will add extra battery capacity, but it will mean that iPhone 17 Air users who need more battery will have to compromise on thickness.\nThe iPhone 17 models are expected to support up to 35W wired charging speeds, which means there would be no change from the current charging maximum.\nThe iPhone 17 models could support 25W wireless charging with third-party wireless chargers that support the next-generation Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard. Right now, iPhones are limited to 15W wireless charging with third-party chargers, but the new Qi standard supports up to 25W charging.\nPricing\nThe iPhone 17 Air could be priced at $899, which is the current price for the iPhone 16 Plus. At $899, the iPhone 17 Air would be more expensive than the iPhone 17, but less expensive than the iPhone 17 Pro.\nThe iPhone 17 models could see a price hike, as Apple's component costs are increasing due to tariffs. Apple will pair the potential price increase with new features and design changes to justify the price to consumers, rather than blaming tariffs.\niPhone 17 Air Launch Date\nApple's 2025 iPhone-centric event will take place at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on Tuesday, September 9. Pre-orders may follow on September 12, with a launch to happen on Friday, September 19.\nWhat's Next for the iPhone Air\nApple is already planning for the next few iPhone Air models, and the company plans to introduce an iPhone 19 Air with a larger display in the second half of 2027. The iPhone 18 Air coming in 2026 will be the same size as the iPhone 17 Air coming in September.\nA future version of the iPhone Air could use an upgraded LTPO3 OLED display that uses far less battery power. Apple could introduce this technology by 2027, resulting in iPhones that have longer battery life."

According to the Weibo leaker known as \"\nFixed Focus Digital,\" blue is highly likely to be the \"main color\" of the iPhone 17 Air upon its launch later this year, placed at the forefront of Apple's marketing materials.\nThe leaker went on to explain that the iPhone 17 Air's blue finish is \"different from all the blue colors released by Apple in the past.\" The finish is apparently \"very light,\" and in low-light conditions, could be \"easy to confuse with white.\"\nThe rumor bears a resemblance to the Apple's \"Sierra Blue\" finish, which was the standout color offered on the iPhone 13 Pro. Sierra Blue was the first \"Pro\" iPhone color option to use a lighter shade that was still saturated with color. Sierra Blue was a unique metallic, almost icy look, that could appear blue in some conditions, and light grey in others. Apple went on to further experiment with even paler pastel glass and aluminum colors with the iPhone 15 models.\nFixed Focus Digital has a mixed track record for Apple rumors. While the leaker has had some major wins, such as reporting that the fourth-generation iPhone SE would in fact be the \"iPhone 16e\" and the iPhone 16 Pro's Gold Titanium color option, other claims have been inaccurate.

      "text": "Seasoned leaker Sonny Dickson has shared more dummy models of Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 series, with the latest lot revealing a noticeable shift in Apple's iPhone Pro model design that goes beyond the much-talked-about new rear camera bar.\nDickson points out that the iPhone 17 Pro dummy models feature an outlined area on the back, beginning just below the camera module and extending to the bottom of the chassis. Dickson says this is \"where the glass will change.\"\nAccording to Chinese leaker Fixed Focus Digital, the iPhone 17 Pro models will use a combination of materials \u2014 specifically, a glass section for the logo area integrated into an overall metal chassis. This explains the red areas on the iPhone 17 Pro models we saw in a previous CAD image.\nAccording to The Information, Apple has chosen a half glass, half aluminum build for its high-end devices to increase durability. The glass would allow wireless charging to continue to be available, but a partial aluminum frame would be less prone to breakage.\nApple's current iPhone 16 Pro models feature a titanium chassis \u2013 a change Apple touted as a key upgrade when it debuted with the iPhone 15 Pro. With the introduction of the iPhone 17 lineup, Apple is reportedly planning to bring the entire selection of devices back to aluminum.\nConsistent with rumors and previous CAD images, the dummies depict Apple's embrace of an elongated horizontal camera module along the top of the back of the iPhone 17 Pro models and the iPhone 17 Air, but not on the regular model. The dummies also appear to have a smoother transition between the edges of the camera bump and the back cover, reportedly owing to Apple's use of a new glass-and-metal splicing material process.\nToday's dummies also indicate that all iPhone 17 models \u2013 including the all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air \u2013 will feature MagSafe. The new design will constitute one of the most significant visual changes to Apple's high-end iPhone models in recent years.

      "text": "We\u2019re only a few months away from the official launch of the iPhone 17 lineup, and multiple reports have covered what colors to expect for the new phones. Every year, Apple tries to surprise us with a few new colors for the new generation, and this year will be no different.\nMacworld has received information from independent sources about the colors of the iPhone 17 lineup that corroborate the latest rumors, so we now have a better idea of what they will look like.\nThese are the new iPhone 17 colors\nTo recap, some leakers have already reported on the potential colors for some of the models in the iPhone 17 family. For instance, a leaker known as Majin Bu said that Apple had been experimenting with purple and green versions of the iPhone 17 base model. The leaker also claims that the rumored ultra-thin \u201ciPhone 17 Air\u201d model will be available in a light shade of blue.\nMore recently, reputable leaker Sonny Dickson also revealed the possible two new colors of the 17 Pro models: dark blue and copper. Independent sources who requested anonymity told Macworld that we can indeed expect these new colors for the iPhone 17 lineup. The same source independently verified the Desert Titanium color for the iPhone 16 Pro before last year\u2019s launch.\nFoundry\nWe also obtained access to an internal document with the Pantone colors used as a reference for designing and building the new iPhones.\nWhile the colors are currently the same for both the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, Apple will provide different color options for the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air to distinguish the two models. The iPhone 17 base model is expected to be available in the following colors:\n- Black (same as iPhone 16)\n- White (same as iPhone 16)\n- Steel Gray (Pantone 18-4005-TPG)\n- Green (Pantone 2282 U)\n- Purple (Pantone 530 U)\n- Light Blue (Pantone 658 U)\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 17 Air will be available in four color options:\n- Black (same as iPhone 16)\n- White (brighter/colder than the iPhone 16)\n- Light Blue (Pantone 657 U)\n- Light Gold (Pantone 11-0604 TPG Gardenia)\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that, at least based on Pantone color references, the blue iPhone 17 Air will be slightly lighter than the base iPhone 17. Apple reportedly wants less saturated colors for the iPhone 17 Air to reinforce the lightness of the device, which is expected to weigh around 145 grams and be 5.5 mm thick.\nFoundry\nAccording to our sources, the blue of the iPhone 17 Air will resemble the Sky Blue introduced with the M4 MacBook Air. At the same time, the Gardenia model should look like a lighter version of the current Desert Titanium color option on the iPhone 16 Pro.\nSpeaking of the Pro models, Apple has prepared new colors for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max as well:\n- Black (same as iPhone 16 Pro)\n- White (same as iPhone 16 Pro)\n- Gray (similar to Natural Titanium)\n- Dark Blue (Pantone 19-4025 TPG Mood Indigo)\n- Orange (Pantone 1501243 TCX Papaya)\nThe blue iPhone 17 Pro will likely be very similar to the Blue Titanium color previously offered with the iPhone 15 Pro. The orange, on the other hand, will have a \u201cfluorescent\u201d look, according to our source, which also notes that due to materials and light in the real world, the colors on actual devices may differ slightly from their Pantone-based representations. Apple is reportedly switching from titanium to aluminum with the iPhone 17 Pro, which has clearly affected the shades Apple has chosen.\nFoundry\nApple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 at an event in September with several new features, including an A19 chip, 12GB of RAM for the Pro models, and a larger screen for the standard iPhone 17. Most notably, the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air will replace the iPhone 16 Plus. There\u2019s also expected to be a new design for the rear camera, with a larger array that stretches across the back of the back."

      "text": "iPhone 17 Air Rumored to Be Available in These Four Colors\nApple plans to offer the iPhone 17 Air in at least four colors, including Black, Silver, Light Gold, and Light Blue, according to a leaker known as Majin Bu.\nThe new lighter blue color option for the device was first mentioned a day ago by Fixed Focus Digital, a Weibo account with more than two million followers, and Majin Bu said that he has confirmed this information with his own sources.\nIt is unclear if Light Gold and Light Blue will be Apple's actual marketing names for those colors, if this rumor proves to be accurate.\nMajin Bu said that the Light Blue color will be similar to the Sky Blue finish offered for the latest MacBook Air, so perhaps Apple would opt to extend the Sky Blue name to the iPhone 17 Air. This is merely speculation on our part.\nAs a refresher, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to be the thinnest iPhone ever. However, the device is expected to have some compromises compared to iPhone 17 Pro models, including worse battery life, only a single rear camera, only a single speaker, and potentially either an A19 chip or a slightly limited version of the A19 Pro chip.\nThe device is also expected to have a 6.6-inch OLED display, MagSafe, and 12GB of RAM.\nApple should unveil the iPhone 17 Air in September.\nMajin Bu has a mixed track record with Apple rumors.

      "text": "The 2025 iPhone 17\nContents\n2025 may bring one of the biggest updates to the iPhone's design that we've seen since the 2017 iPhone X, with Apple rumored to be planning for an all-new iPhone 17 \"Air\" that has a thinner design, a new display size, a different look for the camera, and more.\nWe are expecting four total models in 2025: the iPhone 17, the iPhone 17 Pro, the iPhone 17 Pro Max, and the new iPhone 17 \"Air.\" There will be no iPhone 17 Plus, with Apple doing away with the \"Plus\" lineup because it has not proven popular with customers. The slimmed down iPhone 17 Air won't be a direct replacement for the iPhone 17 Plus, instead making a debut as a new device option in the lineup. Rumors suggest that the upcoming iPhone 17 Air will have a display that's around 6.6 inches, and a chassis that's 6mm thick or less.\nIf we compare the iPhone lineup to the Mac and iPad lineups, the iPhone 17 Air will be comparable to the MacBook Air or the iPad Air, while the iPhone 17 Pro is the equivalent of the MacBook Pro or the iPad Pro.\nBecause the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will have 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch display sizes like the current 16 Pro models, the iPhone 17 Air will be right in the middle of those two devices in terms of size. Apple is also expected to increase the overall size of the standard iPhone 17 to 6.3 inches to match the size of the iPhone 17 Pro.\nSome early rumors suggested the slimmer iPhone 17 Air could be a high-end device that's more expensive than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, but it's actually going to be a mid-tier device that's less expensive than the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, but more expensive than the iPhone 17. In that way, it will replace the \"Plus\" iPhone in the lineup as a middle ground in price between the 17 and the 17 Pro.\nAll four iPhones released in 2025 are expected to get ProMotion display technology with a 120Hz maximum refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video playback, which means that ProMotion will no longer be a feature limited to the Pro iPhone models. The change will be enabled by LTPO OLED displays that Apple is rumored to be using for all of the iPhone 17 models. Always-on display technology is also enabled by LTPO display technology, but it's not yet clear if always-on will come to all models or remain exclusive to the Pro iPhone models.\nFor the Pro models, Apple could swap out titanium for aluminum, and part of the glass frame could transition to aluminum for better durability. We've heard rumors indicating that the iPhone 17 Pro models will have a half-glass half-aluminum exterior, with the glass portion still allowing for MagSafe charging. This update could come alongside a camera design change, with Apple perhaps opting for a horizontal pill-shaped camera bump rather than the traditional square camera bump. We've also heard that the iPhone 17 Air could have a horizontal camera bump, so this is likely to be a design change that we'll see for multiple iPhones in the lineup.\nAs for camera updates, Apple is said to be working on an updated 24-megapixel front-facing camera with a six-element lens, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max could include an upgraded 48-megapixel Telephoto camera, which would be an improvement over the current 12-megapixel sensor. The iPhone 17 is expected to have the same Wide and Ultra Wide cameras, while the iPhone 17 Air is expected to get a single-lens 48-megapixel rear camera.\nAt least one iPhone 17 model next year will get an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip rather than a chip manufactured by Broadcom, and it's likely to be the iPhone 17 Air. Apple is also expected to use its own modem chip in the device, testing it instead of a Qualcomm chip. The standard iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Pro models are likely to continue to use Qualcomm chips.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\nDesign\niPhone 17\nThis year, Apple is planning for an iPhone 17, an iPhone 17 Air, an iPhone 17 Pro, and an iPhone 17 Pro Max, but there will be no iPhone 17 Plus in the lineup. Apple is nixing the \"Plus\" iPhone due to subpar sales and limited customer interest in the device.\nThe standard iPhone 17 will look a lot like the current iPhone 16, with most rumors focusing on the iPhone 17 Air and the iPhone 17 Pro models. So far, we haven't heard a lot that's specific to the iPhone 17, and it will be the iPhone that gets the fewest new features in terms of design.\nWe are expecting a larger display size. Rumors suggest the iPhone 17 display will be 6.3 inches, up from 6.1 inches. At 6.3 inches, it'll be the same size as the iPhone 16 Pro, which is also the size that Apple plans to use for the iPhone 17 Pro. Apple is eliminating the Plus model entirely, so there's just going to be the one lower-priced standard iPhone 17. Display sizes across the lineup will be 6.3 inches for the iPhone 17 and 17 Pro, 6.6 inches for the iPhone 17 Air, and 6.9 inches for the iPhone 17 Pro Max.\nThe iPhone 17 Air and iPhone 17 Pro models are rumored to have a new rectangular camera bar with rounded corners, with the bar spanning the back of the iPhone. The standard iPhone 17 model is not expected to feature the same design change, and it will continue to look like the iPhone 16 with two vertical rear cameras positioned in a pill-shaped camera bump.\nApple is said to be testing new green and purple shades for the upcoming iPhone 17 models. The iPhone 17 models could come in black, white, steel gray, light blue, green, and purple.\nBased on CAD renders, mockups, and dummy models, there is no change to the design of the iPhone 17 camera, while the iPhone 17 Air has a single lens rear camera with an elongated bump. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max feature a wide bump that houses three lenses in the same arrangement as the current design, but with a horizontal bump that adds more space between the lenses and the LiDAR and flash.\nAll of the iPhone 17 models coming in 2025 could feature slimmed down bezels, with the smaller bezels of the 16 Pro and Pro Max expanding to the iPhone 17.\nThere have been mixed rumors about the size of the Dynamic Island for the iPhone 17 models. Analyst Jeff Pu claims that Apple is using metalens technology for Face ID that will allow for a narrower Dynamic Island on all four models, but Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo does not expect notable changes to the Dynamic Island and he believes it will be the same size as the iPhone 16 Dynamic Island.\niPhone 17 'Air'\nMultiple rumors have suggested that Apple is working on an all-new version of the iPhone for 2025, with the device expected to have a \"significantly thinner\" design than current iPhone models. It won't be a direct replacement for the \"Plus\" iPhone that Apple has released for the last several years, but we aren't getting an iPhone 17 Plus this year in order to make room for the new iPhone 17 Air.\nWe've heard Apple's new super thin iPhone referred to as the \"iPhone 17 Slim\" or the \"iPhone 17 Air,\" but we don't know what Apple will actually call the new iPhone when it launches in 2025. iPhone 17 Air seems to make the most sense given that Apple already has a MacBook Air and an iPad Air and uses the name to distinguish those devices from higher-end Pro models.\nThe placeholder names reference the sleeker, thinner design of the device. Rumors have not exactly agreed on size, and we've heard everything from 5mm thick to a bit over 6mm thick. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes the iPhone 17 Air will be about two millimeters thinner than the current iPhone 16 Pro. The iPhone 16 Pro is 8.25mm thick, so an iPhone 17 that is 2mm thinner would come in at around 6.25mm. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that the iPhone 17 Air will be 5.5mm thick at its thinnest point, and his wording suggests that it would have a thicker rear camera bump area that exceeds the size of the 5.5mm chassis.\nAnalyst Jeff Pu has also suggested that the upcoming iPhone will be around 6mm thick, but The Information has said it will be between 5mm and 6mm thick. Dummy models are 5.5mm thick, so the iPhone 17 Air will be Apple's thinnest iPhone to date. The iPhone 6, which measured in at 6.9mm, is the thinnest iPhone Apple has released so far. iPhones actually got thicker with the iPhone X and beyond, as Apple needed more space for the battery, camera lenses, Face ID hardware, and more.\nAs for overall display size, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to fall somewhere between the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max in size. Separate rumors have targeted 6.55 inches, 6.6 inches, and 6.65 inches as the diagonal display size that Apple has settled on, which would make it smaller than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, but larger than the 17 Pro.\nRumors suggest that the iPhone 17 Air will weigh in at 145 grams. That would make it similar in weight to the iPhone SE 2 or the iPhone 13 mini, which are 148 grams and 141 grams, respectively.\nThe Information claims the rear camera of the device will be relocated from the upper left side of the iPhone to the center of the device. The camera setup was described as a \"large, centered camera bump\" on the back of the device. Such a design has been seen in an alleged component leak and in dummy models, plus we've heard similar rumors about the iPhone 17 Pro.\nThe iPhone 17 Air will have some subtle design changes so that all of the internal components can fit despite the thinness of the chassis. Dummy models suggest that the USB-C port on the bottom edge won't be centered front to back, and will instead be shifted closer to the rear of the device. Colors could include black, silver, gold, and a very light blue.\nThe speaker grilles have also been simplified, with just two holes on either side of the port rather than the typical five. The device will include MagSafe charging, a Camera Control button, and an Action Button.\nA closer look at the thin design of the iPhone 17 Air can be seen in a video that shows off an iPhone 17 Air dummy model. Dummy models are often an accurate representation of what we can expect, as they are created for case makers based on leaked information from Apple's suppliers.\nFor more information on the upcoming iPhone 17 Air, we have a dedicated iPhone 17 Air roundup.\niPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are going to have some significant design changes. Apple is allegedly planning to eliminate the titanium frame, instead going back to aluminum. Apple has not used aluminum for a higher-end iPhone since the stainless steel iPhone X was introduced in 2017.\nAlong with an aluminum frame, the iPhone 17 Pro models are rumored to include a half-aluminum half-glass backing rather than an all-glass back. The top half of the back could be made from aluminum, while the bottom half will continue to be made from glass to support wireless charging functionality. A partial aluminum back would potentially make the iPhone 17 Pro models more durable to drops.\nApple is planning for a larger \"rectangular\" horizontal camera bump that is made from aluminum rather than glass. Current camera bumps are square, so a rectangular camera bump would be a notable design change. Though the rear camera design is changing, the lenses themselves are expected to still be arranged in a triangle shape.\nLeaked iPhone 17 Pro cases provide a look at just how large the rear camera bump might be. There is an oversized rectangular cutout that spans the entire back of the case.\nApple may relocate the Apple logo on the back of the iPhone 17 Pro models, possibly because of the redesigned camera module. Rumors suggest that Apple will move the logo lower on the device, and it could be located inside a break in the MagSafe ring.\nTo accommodate the relocated logo, Apple may also tweak the MagSafe magnet layout compared to existing iPhone models. Leaked images of the alleged iPhone 17 Pro magnet array feature a design with an open bottom for the Apple logo.\nLeaked iPhone 17 Pro components suggest that the iPhone 17 Pro models could be available in a copper-like orange color, along with black, gray, silver, and dark blue. If the parts are accurate, these could be the colors that Apple will offer.\nAdditional rumors about the iPhone 17 Pro can be found in the iPhone 17 Pro roundup.\nOne leaker has suggested that one of the iPhone 17 Pro colors could somehow reflect the Liquid Glass design language in the iOS 26 update. Instant Digital said that there is a \"special\" color that is \"connected to the iOS 26 Liquid Glass design.\nThe leaker believes that the color that prior leaks refer to as white actually looks different depending on the light, perhaps with more of an iridescent look.\niPhone 17 Cases\nApple is rumored to be designing new \"TechWoven\" fabric-style cases for the iPhone 17 lineup. The cases are said to offer enhanced durability compared to the prior FineWoven cases that Apple used to sell.\nThe iPhone cases appear to have small holes at the bottom corners that would accommodate a lanyard or a crossbody strap. They are said to have metallic buttons with \"improved tactile feedback,\" a Camera Control button, and MagSafe compatibility.\nThe cases could come in colors that include black, green, blue, purple, and orange.\nApple is also supposedly going to offer a crossbody strap that features a unique magnetic attachment system.\nThermal Upgrades\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models will reportedly use vapor chamber cooling technology for improved thermal performance. Vapor chamber technology disperses heat across a larger surface area to prevent thermal throttling and to keep performance stable, and it could be a benefit for Apple's high-powered A19 chip.\nWhile this could be a feature limited to the iPhone 17 Pro, there has been a rumor suggesting that Apple will use a vapor chamber heatsink to improve thermal performance across all iPhone 17 models.\nDisplay\nThere are a few enhancements coming to the iPhone 17's display, with Apple adding a new coating and planning to bring Pro features to standard models.\nThe iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air are expected to use the same OLED panel as the current iPhone 16 Pro models, which is sourced from Samsung. The panel has a 30 percent increase in brightness and improved longevity compared to the prior-generation iPhone 16 display.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models were going to be updated with a scratch resistant anti-reflective display coating, but it sounds like that might not happen this year after all. Apple ran into issues scaling up its display coating process, and it was too slow when taking into account millions of devices, so the coating plan was scrapped.\nProMotion and Always-On\nThe 120Hz \"ProMotion\" refresh rate has been limited to the Pro versions of the iPhone for several years, but in 2025, it is expected to expand to the entire iPhone lineup. Multiple rumors suggest that the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air models will include ProMotion support in addition to the iPhone 17 Pro models. ProMotion refresh rates would potentially allow for always-on display functionality, but it is not clear if Apple plans to expand always-on to the entire lineup.\nApple will use low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) panels for all iPhone 17 models, which is what enables ProMotion thanks to better power efficiency. ProMotion enables refresh rates ranging from 1Hz to 120Hz, and at the high end, the 120Hz refresh rate provides smoother scrolling and video content.\nWith all four iPhones slated to get ProMotion displays in 2025, ProMotion refresh rates will no longer be a feature that sets the Pro iPhone models apart.\nA-Series Chip\nThe iPhone 17 series won't get TSMC's next-generation 2-nanometer chips, but we are expecting A19 chip technology that's likely built on an upgraded 3-nanometer process. Apple typically upgrades iPhones with faster and more efficient chip technology each year.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to include an A19 Pro chip, while the iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Air could have the standard A19 chip. There's also a chance that the iPhone 17 Air will have an A19 Pro with one fewer GPU core than the A19 Pro used for the iPhone 17 Pro models.\nThe A19 chips will be built on TSMC's 3NP process. Compared to earlier versions of 3nm chips, the N3P chips offer increased performance efficiency and increased transistor density.\nRAM\nThe iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone 17 Air are expected to include 12GB RAM, an improvement over the 8GB RAM in the current high-end iPhone 16 models. Rumors suggest the standard iPhone 17 will only have 8GB RAM.\nApple-Designed 5G Modem Chip\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to be one of the first iPhones to get an Apple-designed 5G modem, with Apple continuing to use Qualcomm modems for the other iPhone 17 models.\nApple's modem chip will be capable of theoretical 5G download speeds of up to 4Gb/s, which is slower than Qualcomm's modems in current phones. The chip will not support the fastest mmWave 5G, and will instead be limited to sub-6GHz 5G.\nSIM Tray\nApple will remove the physical SIM slot on iPhones in more countries next year, though it is not yet clear which countries. Apple did away with the SIM card tray in the United States with the iPhone 14 models, but a physical SIM has so far been present on iPhones sold outside of the United States.\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to lack a SIM tray entirely because of how thin it is.\nBluetooth and Wi-Fi Chip\nAll four iPhone 17 models that are coming in 2025 will have Apple's first custom-designed Wi-Fi chip with Wi-Fi 7 support. Wi-Fi 7 is already used in the iPhone 16 models, but Apple's chip design could bring additional efficiency and connectivity improvements, and it paves the way for a future all-in-one SoC.\nApple is aiming to create a wireless setup where the components are tightly integrated and more energy efficient, which will let the company cut down on the battery use of cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth technologies.\nWi-Fi 7 supports data transmission over 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz band simultaneously for faster speeds and lower latency with a supported router. Wi-Fi 7 supports peak speeds of more than 40Gb/s. Bluetooth 5.3 is also expected.\nBattery and Charging\nThe upcoming iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max could have batteries that are easier to remove, adopting the same technology Apple introduced in the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus use a type of adhesive that can be loosened with a low-voltage electrical current, but the 16 Pro and Pro Max have standard adhesive.\nNext year, all iPhone 17 models might have the new, easier to remove adhesive, which makes battery replacements simpler.\nThe iPhone 17 models are expected to support 25W wireless charging with third-party wireless chargers that support the next-generation Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard. Right now, iPhones are limited to 15W wireless charging with third-party chargers, but the new Qi standard supports up to 25W charging.\nThe upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models might have a reverse wireless charging feature that allows them to wirelessly charge the AirPods and Apple Watch. Apple supposedly tested reverse wireless charging for the iPhone 17 Pro models, but it's not yet clear if it will be in the final version of the device.\nCamera Updates\nAll iPhone models coming in 2025 are rumored to have an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera, which is an improvement over the 12-megapixel front-facing camera in the iPhone 16 models. The camera will notably improve image quality, and allow for more cropping in without a loss of quality.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to feature a 48-megapixel Wide camera, a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, and a 48-megapixel Tetraprism Telephoto camera, which will make it the first iPhone to feature three 48-megapixel cameras, and it is also expected to support 8K video recording for the first time.\nThe iPhone 17 Air will have a single-lens 48-megapixel rear camera, while the standard iPhone 17 will have a dual-lens camera system with a Wide camera and an Ultra Wide camera.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models could feature a mechanical aperture that will let users adjust the size of the camera aperture, changing the amount of light reaching the lens. Current iPhone models have fixed apertures, but a variable aperture will let images be captured with shallow depth-of-field.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models might also support dual video recording, a feature that would allow users to record video with the front and rear cameras simultaneously. Some apps already support this functionality, which is useful for content creators, but the built-in camera does not.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will continue to include a 5x Telephoto optical zoom lens, and it will still be a Pro-exclusive feature. The standard iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Air will not have the 5x zoom option and will have no Telephoto lenses.\nPricing\nThe iPhone 17 Air could be priced at $899, which is the current price for the iPhone 16 Plus. At $899, the iPhone 17 Air would be more expensive than the iPhone 17, but less expensive than the iPhone 17 Pro.\nThe iPhone 17 models may see a price hike, as Apple's component costs are increasing due to tariffs. Apple will pair the potential price increase with new features and design changes to justify the price to consumers, rather than blaming tariffs.\nThe iPhone 17 models could see a $50 price increase compared to the iPhone 16 models, according to Jeffries analyst Edison Lee. The price increase would mean the base iPhone 17 would start at $850.\niPhone 17 Launch Date\nApple is holding an \"Awe Dropping\" iPhone-centric event on Tuesday, September 9 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. The iPhone 17 models will debut at the event. Pre-orders are likely to follow on Friday, September 12, and a launch could happen on Friday, September 19.\nAfter the iPhone 17\nStarting in 2026, Apple will split its iPhone lineup between fall and spring launches. The iPhone 18 Air, iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and a foldable iPhone will launch in the second half of 2026, while the standard iPhone 18 and the iPhone 18e won't launch until spring 2027.\nThe iPhone 18 Pro models that are coming in 2026 could have under-display Face ID, which would cut down on the size of the Dynamic Island. There might just be a single camera hole for the front-facing camera, with the camera cutout located in the top left corner. Later, in 2027, Apple could release an iPhone with an all-screen design, featuring an edge-to-edge display with no cutouts.\nApple's first foldable iPhone is expected in fall 2026, and it will launch alongside the iPhone 18 Air and iPhone 18 Pro models. It is expected to have a \"nearly invisible\" crease when it's folded, thanks to a high-quality hinge.\nThe iPhone 18 Pro expected in 2026 could have a main rear camera with a variable aperture. A variable aperture lens would allow the iPhone to perform more like a DSLR camera, providing users with more manual control over the amount of light entering the lens.\nA variable aperture lens would be able to better adjust to different lighting conditions, and it would also allow for more control over depth of field for sharper focus on subjects and smoother background blur.\nThe iPhone 18 Pro models may include the C2 chip, an upgraded version of Apple's C1 modem. The C2 is expected to feature improved power consumption and transmission speed, and it will include mmWave 5G support.\nApple's iPhone 18 models will use Apple's A20 chip, which could be manufactured on the next-generation 2-nanometer process. The 2nm process will ensure that the A19 has notable speed and performance improvements over the 3nm A19 chip that's coming in the iPhone 17 lineup.\nA future version of the iPhone could have a 200-megapixel camera, which would match technology that Samsung has made available in its Galaxy line. The 200-megapixel camera would likely be for the rear Main lens, and a higher megapixel option would allow the iPhone to shoot photos with more detail. Images would be higher resolution, and would able to be cropped in further without loss of image quality."
