  "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised the test-firing of two types of new antiair missiles, state media said Sunday, displaying his expanding military capabilities as the South Korean and U.S. militaries carry out joint drills.\n\nThe North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said the test Saturday proved the missiles effective in countering aerial threats such as drones and cruise missiles, and that Kim assigned unspecified \u201cimportant\u201d tasks to defense scientists ahead of a major political conference expected early next year.\n\nThe report did not specify the missiles that were tested or where the event took place. It did not mention any remarks by Kim directed at Washington or Seoul.\n\nThe test coincided with new South Korean President Lee Jae Myung\u2019s trip to Tokyo for a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, where they vowed to strengthen bilateral cooperation and their trilateral partnership with the United States to address common challenges, including North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Lee was to depart for Washington on Sunday for a summit with President Donald Trump.\n\nKim\u2019s government has repeatedly dismissed calls by Seoul and Washington to restart long-stalled negotiations aimed at winding down his nuclear and ballistic missile programs, as he continues to prioritize Russia as part of a foreign policy aimed at expanding ties with nations confronting the United States.\n\nSince Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Kim has sent thousands of troops and large shipments of weapons, including artillery and ballistic missiles, to help fuel President Vladimir Putin\u2019s warfighting.\n\nThat has raised concerns Moscow could provide technology that strengthens Kim\u2019s nuclear-armed military, with experts pointing to North Korea\u2019s aging antiair and radar systems as a likely area of cooperation.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s previous conservative government said in November that Russia supplied missiles and other equipment to help strengthen air defenses of the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, but did not specify which systems were provided.\n\nKim held a ceremony in Pyongyang last week to honor North Korean soldiers who fought in Ukraine, awarding state \u201chero\u201d titles to those who returned and placing medals beside 101 portraits of the fallen, praising them as \u201cgreat men, great heroes and great patriots,\u201d state media reported.\n\nAccording to South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent around 15,000 troops to Russia since last fall and about 600 of them have died in combat.\n\nKim has also agreed to send thousands of military construction workers and deminers to Russia\u2019s Kursk region, a deployment South Korean intelligence believes could happen soon.",

      "text": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Few people understand what may be going through the minds of North Korean soldiers fighting and dying for Russia in the war against Ukraine. But Lee Chul Eun is one of them.\nLee, 38, a North Korean defector and former soldier now living in South Korea, said it is \u201cdevastating\u201d to see troops from the reclusive, communist-ruled North being sent abroad by leader Kim Jong Un, \u201conly to then give up their youth for a land that is not even theirs but the foreign land of Russia.\u201d\nHe is one of multiple defectors who spoke to NBC News about the training, conditions and mindset of North Korean soldiers, including their willingness to take their own lives if necessary.\nLee said his former colleagues \u201care essentially just sent out to be cannon fodder on the front lines.\u201d\nFor the first time since they arrived in Russia in the fall, North Korean soldiers have been captured alive by Ukrainian forces, with video and photos showing one man with bandages around his jawline and another with bandaged hands.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who announced the prisoners\u2019 apprehension earlier this month, said they were living proof that North Korea had entered the war, in a major escalation of the yearslong conflict.\nThe U.S. and allies say there are more than 11,000 North Korean troops fighting in the Russian region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion in August. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has confirmed the reports.\n\u201cHonestly, it is not easy to capture a North Korean soldier,\u201d Ryu Sung Hyu said in an interview in the South Korean capital, Seoul.\nAll North Korean recruits are taught a song that includes a verse about saving their last bullet for themselves to avoid capture, said Ryu, who served in the North Korean military until 2019, when he escaped to freedom in South Korea.\nAccording to South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, there was at least one recent incident in which a North Korean soldier, faced with possible capture by Ukrainian forces, tried to detonate a grenade while shouting Kim\u2019s name but was killed before he could succeed.\nThe South Korean military said last week that North Korea is preparing to send additional troops to Russia after about 300 of its soldiers were killed and 2,700 others were injured. The high casualty rate was due to the soldiers\u2019 poor understanding of modern warfare, as well as the way they were being deployed by Russia, South Korean lawmakers said.\nTheir willingness to fight and die for Russia could be a major factor in determining the course of the Ukraine war, as well as the level of American military aid to Ukraine under President Donald Trump, who has expressed skepticism over continued U.S. support.Kim is thought to be providing Russian President Vladimir Putin with troops and weapons in hope of receiving technical assistance with his nuclear and ballistic missile programs. His flurry of weapons testing has continued with three launches already this year, including multiple short-range ballistic missiles, a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile and strategic cruise missiles.\nTrump drew ire from South Korea on Tuesday after he described the reclusive regime as a \u201cnuclear power,\u201d a phrase that U.S. officials have long refrained from using, as it could signal recognition of North Korea as a nuclear-armed state.\nKim is sending troops to Russia for two reasons, \u201cboth of which are driven by desperation,\u201d said Ahn Chan Il, who served in the North Korean military for over a decade and defected to South Korea in 1979. The first is to earn foreign currency, which is in short supply in North Korea under United Nations sanctions imposed over its weapons programs.The deployment also provides valuable experience for the North Korean military, which has not been deployed overseas since the Vietnam War.\nDorothy Camille Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council this month that fighting alongside Russia makes North Korea \u201cmore capable of waging war against its neighbors.\u201d\nLee, who spent five years in the North Korean military, said the troops had been sent to Russia as mercenaries rather than soldiers, noting that they weren\u2019t wearing their uniforms. South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service has said they were given Russian military uniforms and Russian-made weapons, along with forged identification documents.\n\u201cEven if they die there it does not matter, because North Korea sent them out without officially recognizing them,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey were sent there not to bring honor to the country, but to give up their lives and bring back lots of money.\u201d\n'No longer a part of the society'\nMilitary service is compulsory in North Korea, which has one of the world\u2019s largest standing armies. Soldiers undergo three months of basic training before being assigned to a unit, said Lee, who came to South Korea in 2016 after swimming for six hours from the North.\n\u201cAs soldiers,\u201d Lee said, \u201cthey are told they are individuals who are now no longer a part of the society and their families, and must follow the orders of the supreme leader,\u201d meaning Kim.\nThey have no trouble believing this, having been indoctrinated by North Korean propaganda from childhood, said Lee.\nNorth Korean soldiers spend most of their time not actually being soldiers but working on farms and construction projects, Lee and others said.\n\u201cI think I only fired three bullets per year,\u201d said Lee Hyun-seung, who served in the North Korean military for more than three years. When he moved to a more elite unit, he said, \u201cwe had more like 20 bullets.\u201dAsked whether he thought the North Korean troops could help Russia win the war, Lee \u2014 whose family defected in 2014 and who now lives in the U.S. \u2014 was skeptical.\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not that sure,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I know their training and I know they are not well trained.\u201d\nFor North Korean soldiers, who receive food and clothing but are otherwise essentially unpaid, the main enemy is hunger.\nNorth Korea struggles with food shortages as Kim devotes the majority of resources to his weapons programs, meaning that, like most of the broader population, soldiers suffer from malnutrition and can even starve to death.\nMeals are made up mainly of plain rice, corn or potatoes, sometimes mixed with grass or even tree bark, said Lee Chun Eul.\nHe said his feelings about North Korea changed gradually, largely due to his exposure to foreign media that finds its way into the country despite tight government controls \u2014 \u201cJames Bond\u201d was a favorite of his growing up in the 1990s. More recently, the North Korean government has been alarmed by the popularity of South Korean TV dramas, sentencing two teenagers to 12 years of hard labor for watching them.\n\u201cWhen I look at North Korean mercenaries sent to Russia, I wonder if they would still have joined if they had watched as much foreign media as I did in North Korea,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI also wonder if the North Korean regime and Kim Jong Un\u2019s dictatorship would still be in place.\u201d\nThe defectors say they hope the North Korean troops fighting in Russia will take the opportunity to leave like they did.\n\u201cWhen North Korean workers, who have lived their entire lives trapped in a restrictive system, experience life abroad, they come to see North Korea as nothing short of a prison,\u201d Ahn said. \u201cOnce they realize what freedom could mean, it\u2019s hard to imagine they wouldn\u2019t consider breaking free to live a freer life.\u201dIn addition to finding freedom, they could provide the U.S. and others with valuable intelligence regarding the North Korean military\u2019s strategies and capabilities, which are often exaggerated by the North Korean government.\nAhn and other North Koreans who defected as soldiers have offered Ukraine their assistance against the North Korean troops.\n\u201cHowever, rather than directly participating in the war, our focus is on psychological warfare to change the mindset of North Korean soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough platforms like YouTube or leaflets, we aim to deliver messages to the North Korean troops, urging them not to die meaningless deaths and instead seek freedom.\u201d\nIn the meantime, they watch with heavy hearts as casualties mount among North Korean soldiers whose experiences they know only too well.\n\u201cThese young people did not go knowing they were going to die,\u201d Lee said, \u201cbut died because they did not know.\nJanis Mackey Frayer and Stella Kim reported from Seoul, South Korea, and Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong."

      "text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un hailed his country\u2019s fallen soldiers in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine as \u201cheroes\u201d at an emotional award ceremony, state media said Friday, in a rare public admission of the losses Pyongyang has suffered in the conflict.\nThe North Korean leader \u201cextended deep gratitude and warmest militant respect\u201d to those who had returned home \u201cdespite the hail of bullets and bombs of the life-and-death war in the foreign country,\u201d state news agency KCNA reported.\n\u201cThe victory won by the brave soldiers who participated in the war is a great feat that firmly defended the great honor of the KPA,\u201d Kim was quoted as saying, referring to his military, the Korean People\u2019s Army.\nPhotos released by state media showed Kim pinning commendation badges on soldiers\u2019 uniforms as well as on photo frames of deceased soldiers hung on a wall. They also showed him meeting with and embracing tearful family members of deceased soldiers.\nKCNA said Kim laid a flower on a memorial wall and paid a silent tribute at the ceremony, during which the national anthem was also played.\nThe ceremony on Thursday came a week after Kim received a letter from Russian President Vladimir Putin that also described the North Korean troops as \u201cheroic.\u201d\n\u201cThe bonds of militant friendship, goodwill and mutual aid which were consolidated in the days of the war long ago remain solid and reliable even today,\u201d Putin said in the letter published by North Korean state media Voice of Korea.\nPyongyang and Moscow have forged increasingly close ties after the Kremlin found itself diplomatically isolated following its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Kim and Putin signed a mutual defense pact last year, and experts say North Korea may have sent Russia troops in exchange for advanced military technology that would aid its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\nNeither Russia nor North Korea confirmed the deployments until months after Pyongyang sent its first soldiers last fall. Though the two countries have not revealed the exact number of troops involved, it could be as high as 15,000, according to South Korean, U.S. and Ukrainian officials.\nOf those, about 600 are believed to have been killed, South Korea\u2019s spy agency said, and thousands more injured.\nThough North Korea has one of the largest militaries in the world, its troops have had little real-world combat experience since the end of the Korean War in 1953. But they are strongly loyal to Kim and are trained to take their own lives rather than surrender, former North Korean soldiers who defected have told NBC News.\nAccording to South Korean intelligence, there was at least one incident in which a North Korean soldier seeking to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces was killed while trying to detonate a grenade and shouting Kim\u2019s name.\nIt is unclear how many North Korean troops remain on the frontlines. South Korean lawmakers said after an intelligence briefing in June that North Korea could deploy additional troops to Russia in July or August and that it was continuing to supply Moscow with arms.\nIt is \u201chighly unusual\u201d for North Korea to hold a ceremony honoring soldiers during an ongoing conflict, Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told NBC News.\nThe absence of any senior Russian representatives or any reference to close ties with Russia could indicate that North Korea is \u201cexpressing dissatisfaction at being sidelined\u201d in recent negotiations among Putin, President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy over ending the war in Ukraine, Yang said.\n\u201cIf such dissatisfaction continues, cracks could appear between Pyongyang and Moscow,\u201d he said.\nBut if they manage to mend their differences, Yang said, \u201cit cannot be ruled out that North Korean forces will remain stationed for a time as a tripwire along the Russia\u2013Ukraine border.\u201d"

      "text": "The Trump administration said Friday that it had taken a 10% stake in Intel, the president's latest extraordinary move to exert federal government control over private business.\nThe United States will not seek direct representation on Intel's board and pledged to vote with the current Board of Directors on matters requiring shareholder approval, \"with limited exceptions,\" according to a joint release from the Trump administration and Intel. The move also comes as the United States vies with China in the race to dominate the artificial intelligence industry.\nPresident Donald Trump announced the deal on his Truth Social platform Friday, praising the company's CEO just two weeks after he called on the executive to resign over alleged China ties.\n\"It is my Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL, a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future,\" he wrote. \"I negotiated this Deal with Lip-Bu Tan, the Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The United States paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars. This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL. Building leading edge Semiconductors and Chips, which is what INTEL does, is fundamental to the future of our Nation.\"\nWhile the U.S. held temporary stakes in firms at the center of the 2008-2009 global financial meltdown as part of a bailout, this move is unusual since the economy is not embroiled in a crisis. Congress published a study in 2003 that examined the impact of the federal government taking direct stakes in public companies, concluding that doing so would \u201cnot offer a free lunch\u201d and expose taxpayers to \u201cgreater risk\u201d alongside the upside potential.\nThe stake will be paid for through $5.7 billion in grants previously awarded to Intel under the 2022 U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, plus $3.2 billion awarded to the company as part of a program called Secure Enclave. It\u2019s a formerly classified initiative that Congress appropriated funds for in 2024 after lobbying by Intel, Politico reported in 2024.\nIncluding $2.2 billion in CHIPs grants Intel has received so far, the total investment is $11.1 billion, or 9.9%. Intel is valued at about $108 billion on the stock market.\nTrump continues to bulldoze through long-held norms regarding government and business, departing from the free-market ethos that has long prevailed in both major U.S. political parties.\nThis month, Trump persuaded the chipmakers Nvidia and AMD to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenues from some sales to China in return for securing export licenses there.\nWhile those firms have seen their fortunes rise amid the larger artificial intelligence boom, a windfall from any of them is no sure thing. In the case of California-based Intel, the company has struggled to keep up with rivals in recent years, with its shares down some 60% from the highs seen during the pandemic.\nBut amid the ongoing artificial intelligence arms race \u2014 and the goal of making computer chips a national security priority \u2014 Trump officials zeroed in on Intel as a means of leveling up U.S. control over semiconductor production.\nEarlier this week, Japan\u2019s SoftBank also announced it would invest $2 billion in Intel to \u201cdeepen their commitment to investing in advanced technology and semiconductor innovation in the United States.\"\nSome Democrats signaled they were on board with the move.\n\"U.S. leadership is critical for both our economy and national security,\" U.S. Senator Mark Warner, D-Virginia, said in a statement Friday evening.\n\"Taking an equity stake in Intel may or may not be the right approach, but one thing is clear: allowing cutting-edge chips to flow to China without restraint will erode the value of any investment we make here at home. We need a strategy that protects American innovation, strengthens our workforce, and keeps the technologies of the future firmly in American hands.\""

      "text": "A liberal lawyer was elected president of South Korea on Tuesday, ending months of political instability in the key U.S. ally that began with a botched declaration of martial law.\nLee Jae-myung, leader of the Democratic Party, was sworn into office Wednesday. His conservative rival, Kim Moon-soo, of the People Power Party, said he humbly accepted \u201cthe choice of the people.\u201d\nAccording to the National Election Commission, Lee received 49.4% of the vote, while Kim received just over 41%. Another conservative candidate, Lee Jun-seok of the upstart Reform Party, received 8.3%.\nIn his inauguration speech, Lee, 61, emphasized national unity after the martial law episode and said he would be \u201ca president who ends the politics of division.\u201d\n\u201cWe will fully uncover the truth, assign proper responsibility and establish firm measures to prevent recurrence,\u201d he said.\nLee said he would lead a \u201cpragmatic, market-oriented government\u201d and strengthen U.S.-South Korea relations and trilateral cooperation with the U.S. and Japan.\nIn a departure from his predecessor, Lee also said he would engage in dialogue with rival North Korea while responding strongly to its nuclear and military provocations.\n\u201cWe will restore the military\u2019s honor and the public\u2019s trust, which were damaged by illegal martial law, and ensure that the military is never again mobilized for politics,\u201d he said.\nThe election took place six months to the day after President Yoon Suk Yeol shocked the East Asian democracy of more than 50 million people by abruptly declaring martial law, citing threats from \u201canti-state forces\u201d and accusing the opposition-controlled parliament of paralyzing the government.\nLawmakers pushed past soldiers Yoon had sent to parliament to vote unanimously against the order, which Yoon then withdrew.\nLed by Lee, lawmakers impeached Yoon on Dec. 14 over the short-lived order, after which South Korea was led by a series of acting presidents. The leadership vacuum has hampered South Korea in Washington as it is trying to negotiate with the Trump administration over a 25% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff and other levies.\nLee, who narrowly lost to Yoon in 2022, had been considered the most likely next president since Yoon was impeached. The election was triggered in April when the Constitutional Court upheld his impeachment.\nBut South Korean voters were animated more by anger at Yoon and his party than by an affinity for Lee.\n\u201cHis victory is not thanks to any particular policy proposals, but rather a result of Yoon\u2019s spectacular collapse,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\nThe martial law episode has deeply unsettled South Korea, which spent decades under military-authoritarian rule. It has also worsened polarization between liberals and conservatives, with regular rallies held for and against Yoon and a presidential campaign filled with personal attacks.\nSome voters directed their anger at Kim, the candidate for Yoon\u2019s former People Power Party, even though Yoon left the party last month to help his campaign.\n\u201cI believe that Lee will restore the democratic system and establish a democratic government,\u201d said Lee Jung Sup, a company executive in Seoul. \u201cThen our economy will be revitalized.\u201d\nKim, who was labor minister under Yoon, criticized the martial law declaration but opposed his impeachment. Supporters pointed to Kim\u2019s squeaky-clean record, contrasting it with Lee\u2019s involvement in several criminal trials.\n\u201cIt is unfair to reflect the martial law declared by the former president onto Kim,\u201d said Oh Chang-soo, a retired religious leader in his 60s.\nLee\u2019s vows to punish those involved in the martial law order have raised fears of further political turmoil. Yoon is still standing trial on charges of insurrection, a crime that is punishable by death or life in prison.\nLee said this week that besides addressing economic concerns and internal division, his main priority is reaching a trade deal with the United States.\nIn addition to the 25% tariff \u2014 which is set to take effect July 9 \u2014South Korea\u2019s trade-dependent economy is vulnerable to sector-specific U.S. levies on some of its most important exports, such as steel and automobiles.\nAsked about President Donald Trump\u2019s tendency to pressure his negotiating partners, Lee said, \u201cThat\u2019s a kind of political behavior exhibited by powerful nations, and we must endure it well.\u201d\n\u201cIf the president of the Republic of Korea\u2019s kowtowing briefly would allow 52 million people to thrive, then he must do so,\u201d he told South Korea\u2019s Christian Broadcasting System on Monday, using the country\u2019s formal name.\nWhile Trump is a formidable figure, Lee said, diplomacy should be mutually beneficial, and \u201cI\u2019m not an easy opponent, either.\u201d\n\u201cWe have a fair number of cards to play,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are things to give and take on both sides.\u201d"

      "text": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea\u2019s President Lee Jae Myung faces a pivotal foreign policy test barely two months after taking office, with back-to-back summits in Tokyo and Washington that reflect the wider struggle of U.S. allies to navigate President Donald Trump\u2019s unilateral push to redefine postwar orders on trade, security and alliances.\nThe meetings come after Seoul and Tokyo reached trade deals with Washington that spared them from the Trump administration\u2019s highest tariffs, but only after pledging hundreds of billions of dollars in new U.S. investments.\nTrump\u2019s transactional approach with long-standing allies extends beyond trade to security and has fueled fears in South Korea that he will demand higher payments to support the U.S. troop presence in the country, even as he possibly seeks to scale back America\u2019s military footprint there to focus on China.\nThe looming concerns about a U.S. retreat in leadership and security commitments come as South Korea and Japan confront growing cooperation between their nuclear-armed adversaries, North Korea and Russia, partners in the war in Ukraine and in efforts to break isolation and evade sanctions.\nA day after confirming his Aug. 25 summit with Trump, Lee\u2019s office announced he will visit Japan on Aug. 23-24 to meet Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, a rare diplomatic setup that underscores how Trump is drawing closer two often-feuding neighbors with deep-rooted historical grievances.\nThe meeting on Saturday in Tokyo of Lee and Ishiba is largely about projecting leverage as the countries seek to coordinate their response to Trump, said Choi Eunmi, an analyst at South Korea\u2019s Asan Institute for Policy Studies.\n\u201cThere is now the Trump risk,\u201d Choi said. \u201cThere\u2019s especially a lot of uncertainty in the business sector, so they might discuss ways to ease that uncertainty \u2026 not necessarily in joint efforts to confront Trump, but within the framework of trilateral cooperation.\u201d\nYukiko Fukagawa, a professor at Japan\u2019s Waseda University, said Lee\u2019s visit to Tokyo will also be seen positively in Washington, long frustrated by its Asian allies\u2019 persistent disputes over Japan\u2019s colonial rule of Korea before the end of World War II, and the way these tensions hindered three-way security collaborations.\n\u201cBecause they have to deal with increasingly challenging mutual counterparts, such as China and America, both Japan and South Korea are under pressure to set aside minor differences to cooperate on larger objectives,\u201d Fukagawa said.\nYoshimasa Hayashi, Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, said Lee\u2019s visit will help promote the \u201cstable development\u201d of bilateral ties as their countries work together on international challenges.\nIshiba, who has met Trump twice in person \u2014 at the White House in February and at the G7 in Canada \u2014 could also offer Lee tips ahead of his summit in Washington.\nSeoul and Tokyo share many crucial interests in the face of Trump\u2019s efforts to reset global trade and U.S. security commitments.\nThey are both under pressure from Washington to pay more for the tens of thousands of American troops stationed in their countries and also to increase their own defense spending. Their vital automobile and technology industries are vulnerable to Trump\u2019s tariff increases.\nThey navigate a tricky balance between the U.S. and its main rival, China, a growing regional threat that is also the largest trade partner for Seoul and Tokyo. They are alarmed by North Korea\u2019s accelerating nuclear program and its deepening alignment with Russia, which could complicate future diplomatic efforts after a long stalemate in U.S.-led denuclearization talks.\nIt makes more sense for South Korea and Japan to work with the Trump administration under a trilateral framework rather than engage Washington separately, especially given how Trump mixes security and economic demands, said Ban Kil-joo, a professor at South Korea\u2019s National Diplomatic Academy.\nFor example, the countries could propose a trilateral scheme to support Trump\u2019s push to expand natural gas and other energy production in Alaska, rather than negotiating potential investments bilaterally, he said.\nLee\u2019s meeting with Trump could include talks to flesh out the details of South Korea\u2019s $350 million investment fund for U.S. industries, centered on cooperation in shipbuilding, a sector Trump has highlighted in relation to South Korea.\nSeoul has one of the largest trade surpluses among Washington\u2019s NATO and Indo-Pacific allies, and Trump is eager to hear from Lee on how his country intends to quickly bridge the trade gap, said Victor Cha, Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\nA more crucial topic for the leaders could be the future of their decades-long military alliance.\nThe U.S., which keeps about 30,000 troops in South Korea to deter North Korea, has long urged Seoul to accept greater flexibility to use them for missions beyond the Korean Peninsula \u2014 a demand that has intensified under Trump.\nComments by senior U.S. government and military officials suggest that, in addition to pressing South Korea to pay more for hosting American forces, the Trump administration could seek to reshape U.S. Forces Korea as part of a broader military focus on ensuring capability to respond to a conflict with China over Taiwan.\nThat shift would mean conventionally armed South Korea taking on more of the burden against the North, while the U.S. turns its focus to China. This could affect the size and role of U.S. Forces Korea, leaving Seoul with fewer benefits but higher costs and risks at a time when the North Korean nuclear threat is growing, experts say."

      "text": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea and the United States began their annual large-scale joint military exercise on Monday to better cope with threats by nuclear-armed North Korea, which has warned the drills would deepen regional tensions and vowed to respond to \u201cany provocation\u201d against its territory.\nThe 11-day Ulchi Freedom Shield, the second of two large-scale exercises held annually in South Korea, after another set in March, will involve 21,000 soldiers, including 18,000 South Koreans, in computer-simulated command post operations and field training.\nThe drills, which the allies describe as defensive, could trigger a response from North Korea, which has long portrayed the allies\u2019 exercises as invasion rehearsals and has often used them as a pretext for military demonstrations and weapons tests aimed at advancing its nuclear program.\nIn a statement last week, North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol said the drills show the allies\u2019 stance of \u201cmilitary confrontation\u201d with the North and declared that its forces would be ready to counteract \u201cany provocation going beyond the boundary line.\u201d\nUlchi Freedom Shield comes at a pivotal moment for South Korea\u2019s new liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who is preparing for an Aug. 25 summit with President Donald Trump in Washington. Trump has raised concerns in Seoul that he may shake up the decades-old alliance by demanding higher payments for the American troop presence in South Korea and possibly reducing it as Washington shifts its focus more toward China.\nTensions on the Korean Peninsula remain high as North Korea has brushed aside Lee\u2019s calls to resume diplomacy with its war-divided rival, with relations having soured in recent years as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un accelerated his weapons program and deepened alignment with Moscow following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s needed now is the courage to steadily take steps toward easing tensions, grounded in a firmly maintained state of ironclad security readiness,\u201d Lee said during a Cabinet meeting on Monday. South Korea also on Monday began a four-day civil defense drill involving thousands of public workers, often scheduled alongside the allies\u2019 summertime military exercises.\nSeoul\u2019s previous conservative government responded to North Korean threats by expanding military exercises with the United States and seeking stronger U.S. assurances for nuclear deterrence, drawing an angry reaction from Kim, who last year renounced long-term reconciliation goals and rewrote the North\u2019s constitution to label the South a permanent enemy.\nIn his latest message to Pyongyang on Friday, Lee, who took office in June, said he would seek to restore a 2018 inter-Korean military agreement designed to reduce border tensions and called for North Korea to respond to the South\u2019s efforts to rebuild trust and revive talks.\nThe 2018 military agreement, reached during a brief period of diplomacy between the Koreas, created buffer zones on land and sea and no-fly zones above the border to prevent clashes.\nBut South Korea suspended the deal in 2024, citing tensions over North Korea\u2019s launches of trash-laden balloons toward the South, and moved to resume frontline military activities and propaganda campaigns. The step came after North Korea had already declared it would no longer abide by the agreement.\nWhen asked whether the Lee government\u2019s steps to restore the agreement would affect the allies\u2019 drills, the South\u2019s Defense Ministry said Monday that there are no immediate plans to suspend live-fire training near the Koreas\u2019 disputed western maritime border.\nWhile the allies have postponed half of Ulchi Freedom Shield\u2019s originally planned 44 field training programs to September, U.S. military officials denied South Korean media speculation that the scaled-back drills were meant to make room for diplomacy with the North, citing heat concerns and flood damage to some training fields.\nDating back to his first term, Trump has regularly called for South Korea to pay more for the 28,500 American troops stationed on its soil. Public comments by senior Trump administration officials have suggested a push to restructure the alliance, which some experts say could potentially affect the size and role of U.S. forces in South Korea.\nUnder this approach, South Korea would take a greater role in countering North Korean threats while U.S. forces focus more on China, possibly leaving Seoul to face reduced benefits but increased costs and risks, experts say."

Kim\u2019s regime has deployed thousands of troops to the Russian front, suffering heavy casualties, and has deepened its military cooperation with Moscow in hopes of acquiring advanced technology for its nuclear program.

Meanwhile, South Korea\u2019s political landscape has shifted with Lee\u2019s election, prompting a renewed focus on diplomatic engagement with North Korea and a reassessment of the U.S. forces\u2019 role in the region.",
