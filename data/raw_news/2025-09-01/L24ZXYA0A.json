  "description": "The project in the Manila Bay entertainment district consists of a five-star hotel, a casino, a shopping mall and several theaters.",
  "content": "Travellers International Hotel\u2014controlled by billionaire Andrew Tan\u2019s Alliance Global\u2014is taking over the development of a $1.3 billion casino resort from its partner Suntrust Resort in Manila Bay following project delays.\n\nSuntrust Resort, which is indirectly owned by Hong Kong-listed LET Group, said it\u2019s seeking a \u201cstrategic working agreement\u201d with Travellers to expedite the completion of the project in the Westside City township being developed by Megaworld, Tan\u2019s real estate arm, in the Manila Bay entertainment district.\n\nUnder the proposed agreement, Suntrust said it will effectively hold a 20% indirect stake in Entertainment City Resorts, owner and lessor of the property where the project is being constructed. Travellers\u2014which owns and operates the Newport World Resorts, a casino complex next to the country\u2019s main international gateway, the Ninoy Aquino International Airport\u2014will have majority interest.\n\nThe Westside City casino complex was supposed to open in December this year but the opening has been postponed to the third quarter of 2026 due to construction delays, according to Suntrust, which started working on the project in 2019.\n\nSuntrust is 51% indirectly owned by Fortune Noble, an investment vehicle controlled by LET Group, formerly Suncity Group. Megaworld owns 34% of Suntrust.\n\nWestside Integrated Resort is the fourth casino in Manila\u2019s Entertainment City, an 800-hectare waterfront district competing with Macau and Singapore to attract gamblers across the region. There are three existing casino resorts in the area including billionaire Enrique Razon Jr.\u2019s Solaire, tycoon Lawrence Ho\u2019s City of Dreams Manila and Tokyo-based Universal Entertainment\u2019s Okada Manila.\n\nWestside Integrated Resort consists of a five-star hotel with 475 suites, a casino with 281 gaming tables and over 1,000 slot machines, a shopping mall and several theaters, the biggest of which will have 3,000 seats.\n\nLET Group is owned by Andrew Lo Kai Bong, a Hong Kong-based gaming entrepreneur who led a group of investors that took control of the former Suncity Group in July 2022. Aside from its interest in the Philippines, its Summit Ascent unit holds a stake in a Russian casino resort.\n\nWith a real-time net worth of $1.5 billion, Tan is among the wealthiest in the Philippines. Apart from real estate, his Alliance Global has stakes in Emperador, the world\u2019s biggest brandy maker, and in the Philippine franchisee of McDonald\u2019s.",

      "text": "Alliance Global Group\u2014controlled by real estate and liquor billionaire Andrew Tan\u2014said Tuesday it has agreed to buy the 40% stake held by its financially troubled partner Genting Hong Kong in their joint venture company, Travellers International, owner of Newport World Resorts hotel and casino in Manila.\nGenting Hong Kong\u2014controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay\u2014is exiting the Philippine casino joint venture after the cruise ship operator went into liquidation in January 2022 as the Covid-19 pandemic upended the tourism industry. Financial details of the transaction weren\u2019t disclosed.\nThe integrated resort was called Resorts World Manila when it opened in 2009 but was renamed Newport World Resorts last year after Genting Hong Kong\u2019s liquidation. Alliance Global, which has been in talks to acquire its partner\u2019s stake in the property for about a year now, will have 100% ownership of the property once the deal is completed.\nThe divestment of the Newport stake is the latest asset to be divested by Genting Group as it focuses on expanding its footprint in New York and revamping its properties in Singapore and Malaysia. Last month, Genting Malaysia sold a waterfront property in Miami for $1.2 billion.\nTaking full ownership of the Philippine casino bodes well for Alliance Global amid a casino boom in the country. Travellers, which also owns and operates hotels outside the Metro Manila, was the fastest growing business segment of Alliance Global this year, with the hotel and casino operator returning to the black as revenue surged 60% to 7.8 billion pesos ($139 million) in the first quarter.\nAlliance Global holds Tan\u2019s interest in Megaworld, one the country\u2019s biggest property developers; Emperador, owner of Spain\u2019s Bodegas Fundador, the world\u2019s No. 1 brandy maker as well as Golden Arches, the Philippine franchisee of McDonald\u2019s. Tan has a net worth of about $2.5 billion, according to Forbes\u2019 real-time data."
