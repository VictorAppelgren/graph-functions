Meanwhile, Ohio cities like Cincinnati face very real challenges that he continues to ignore.\n\nWhat\u2019s in it for him? In President Donald Trump\u2019s pay-for-play White House, no favor is free. DeWine owes us an answer: Is he trading Ohio\u2019s resources for his own political gain? And how much is this pointless deployment costing Ohio taxpayers?\n\nMore: Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine orders 150 National Guard members to DC as states send troops\n\nBy most estimates, the price tag is staggering: $530 per National Guard member, per day; half a million dollars a day for 1,000 troops; and millions more once transport, housing, and equipment are added.\n\nDeWine should stop currying favor with Trump and start doing the job Ohioans elected him to do.\n\nIt is beyond sad that Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine is so feeble against President Donald Trump\u2019s autocratic instincts. What an insult to our troops and taxpayers to send the Ohio National Guard to Washington, D.C., for an expensive, made-up, political fear-mongering effort to claim \"toughness.\" This abuse of power is not tough. It\u2019s pathetic!\n\nSending the Ohio National Guard to DC is a political stunt\n\nWhile I saw Gov. Mike DeWine's comments on his deployment of the Ohio National Guard to Washington, D.C., he dodged the essential question. What exactly does deploying Ohioans to Washington, D.C., for a non-existent problem have to do with the state of Ohio? How exactly is it \"the right thing to do?\"\n\nMore: 'Political theater:' Activists call on Gov. Mike DeWine to not send National Guard to D.C.\n\nIt is not consistent with past deployments, as he stated. It is a stunt and does not align with the ideals on which this country was founded. The governor should be ashamed of his action. I know I am ashamed of being an Ohioan right now.\n\nDeWine is wrong to send troops to D.C.\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine has announced he is sending 150 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to crack down on violent crime there. But statistics from the Department of Justice indicate violent crime is down to a 30-year low in D.C. and down 26% over last year.\n\nDeWine justifies his decision by saying Trump decided to send troops, not him and that the Army asked for backup support. The Ohio National Guard exists to respond to emergencies in our state, such as natural disasters like the catastrophic flooding experienced in Texas or the train derailment and devastation that occurred in East Palestine with the release of toxic fumes. No such emergency exists that warrants sending our Ohio taxpayer-funded resources to Washington, D.C.\n\nDeWine is enabling Trump's dystopian view to militarize the police force against its own citizens, particularly those who are engaged in peaceful protest and exercising their First Amendment rights. It's time to call it what it is: This is a martial law soft launch to expand Trump's authoritarian vision.\n\nIf you don't think this can happen at the ballot box in 2026, just wait and see.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: DeWine's National Guard deployment is costly and pointless | Letters",

Mike DeWine has ordered 150 National Guard members to support the District of Columbia National Guard, as states across the country send troops to the nation's capital.\n\"We have been asked by the Secretary of the Army to send 150 military police from the Ohio National Guard to support the District of Columbia National Guard,\" DeWine said in an Aug. 16 statement.\n\"These Ohio National Guard members will carry out presence patrols and serve as added security,\" he said. \"None of these military police members are currently serving as law enforcement officers in the state of Ohio.\"\nThe deployment comes as other Republican-led states, including West Virginia and South Carolina, also send National Guard members to the nation's capital, The Washington Post reported Aug. 16.\nOn Aug. 11 President Donald Trump said he would deploy National Guard troops to Washington to take over the Metropolitan Police Department, which is authorized during an emergency, as part of an aggressive federal effort to crack down on crime in the nation\u2019s capital.\nU.S. District Judge Ana Reyes told the Justice Department on Aug. 15 to rewrite Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s order so that federal officials would order the mayor to make changes in policing, which the law says the mayor \u201cshall\u201d do, rather than directly control police officers.\nReyes said she couldn\u2019t decide on other issues in DC\u2019s lawsuit against the Trump administration until after collecting evidence at a hearing next week.\nThis is a breaking story and will be updated.\nUSA TODAY staff, including White House correspondent Bart Jansen, contributed to this report.\nNathaniel Shuda is the suburban and Saturday editor for The Columbus Dispatch and news editor for the Newark Advocate.

      "text": "Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine calls sending National Guard to D.C. 'the right thing to do'\nGov. Mike DeWine says it's the \"right thing to do\" to send 150 Ohio National Guard members to Washington, D.C., as President Donald Trump deploys troops and seizes control of the city's Metropolitan Police Department.\nTrump announced on Aug. 11 that he would deploy National Guard troops to Washington to crack down on crime in the nation\u2019s capital. Late Aug. 15, Secretary of the Army Daniel P. Driscoll asked DeWine to send military police to D.C.\n\"The initial decision to deploy D.C. National Guard was not my decision. That was the president of the United States' decision,\" DeWine told the statehouse bureau. \"But when the secretary of the Army asks for backup support to our troops that are already deployed, yes, we will back up our troops.\"\nDeWine is one of three Republican governors who said they'll send additional troops, Reuters reported.\nOhio House Democrats are calling on DeWine to bring the Ohio National Guard home.\n\u201cOhio\u2019s National Guard exists to protect and serve Ohioans and other Americans in moments of true crisis. When disasters like floods, storms, or community emergencies happen here at home, they\u2019re there to rebuild,\" said House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati. \"Their mission is helping Ohioans, not serving as props in a president\u2019s political theatre.\"\nBut DeWine says his decision, which was optional, is consistent with how he's deployed the Ohio National Guard in the past.\nWhat will the Ohio National Guard do in D.C.?\nThe Ohio National Guard will patrol Washington, D.C., and protect federal buildings, DeWine said.\n\"If in doing a patrol or if in standing guard of a federal building, an arrest has to be made, our guard will be in direct contact with the D.C. police department who will make arrests,\" DeWine said. \"Our people won't make the arrests.\"\nHow long will the Ohio National Guard be in the nation's capital?\nThe Ohio National Guard will leave Aug. 20 for a 30-day deployment, DeWine said. The secretary of the Army could ask for an extension, which DeWine could grant or deny.\nHow often does DeWine deploy the Ohio National Guard?\nDeWine deployed Ohio National Guard members and Ohio State Highway Patrol troopers to the southern border in 2021. He also sent members to assist with hurricane recovery in Florida, North Carolina and Louisiana.\nIn 2020, DeWine sent the National Guard to Columbus and Cleveland to respond to protests following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In both instances, mayors requested help.\nThe Ohio National Guard played a key role in Ohio's COVID-19 response and assisted with the aftermath of a train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, in February 2023.\nIs the D.C. deployment different?\nWashington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't ask for help with the city's violent crime rate, which declined 35% between 2023 and 2024. Attorneys for the District of Columbia are suing the Trump administration over its police takeover.\nDeWine says that doesn't matter, legally.\n\"The people who don't like it in D.C. don't have the authority. The president of the United States has that authority,\" DeWine said. \"Anybody can argue whether or not he should or shouldn't have the authority, but it's very clear. There is no debate he has the authority to do what he did.\"\nBut Democrats say the deployment is political. Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Columbus, said in a statement: \"The men and women of Ohio's National Guard signed up to serve their country, not a lawless president who has repeatedly ignored our nation's constitution and principles.\"\nWhat will this cost and who pays?\nThe federal government will pay for the Ohio National Guard's service, a spokesperson said. No cost estimate was available as of Aug. 18.\nIs sending the National Guard optional?\nIt depends. Typically, governors control the National Guard within their states. The federal government can request assistance from state National Guard members, which governors can approve or reject. That is the case with Secretary Driscoll's request for Ohio National Guard assistance in D.C.\n\"The law is not a blank check allowing the president to use military forces anywhere in the country and for any purpose so long as they can find one willing governor,\" according to a Brennan Center for Justice analysis.\nIn certain circumstances, presidents can federalize the National Guard by invoking the Insurrection Act. But this is rare.\nEarlier this year, Trump deployed the California National Guard to respond to protests over immigration enforcement \u2212 against the wishes of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. An appeals court ruled that Trump could retain control of the troops while a judge reviews the legality of Trump's decision.\nWill the Ohio National Guard be deployed to Cincinnati?\nDeWine said he's received no requests to deploy the Ohio National Guard to Cincinnati, where a viral brawl led to debates about the city's security, and has no plans to deploy them.\nDeWine instead offered other help to Cincinnati officials that included traffic enforcement and aviation surveillance.\n\"They've taken me up on part of it, but not all of it,\" DeWine said. \"But that's their choice. They have the choice.\"\nUSA TODAY contributed to this article.\nState government reporter Jessie Balmert can be reached at jbalmert@gannett.com or @jbalmert on X."
