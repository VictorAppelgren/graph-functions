Both prime areas, it may seem high prices may be the cause, but there\u2019s more than meets the eye.\n\n\u201cThe scale of residential construction and conversions has been higher in downtown Manhattan, particularly in specific neighborhoods such as Soho and the East Village, which represent this trend,\u201d said appraiser Jonathan Miller, of Miller Samuel.\n\n\u201cComing out of the pandemic, Manhattan experienced the highest rate of population growth, particularly downtown, which was further aided by many office-to-residential conversions, with many more expected,\u201d he added. \u201cThis has resulted in a potentially higher vacancy rate compared to other boroughs, but it\u2019s not excessive.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, in Staten Island\u2019s Great Kills and Jackson Heights in Queens, just two homes in each community were unoccupied, representing vacancy rates so low they are practically negligible.\n\nBut fear not, demand for city living is still ferocious, at least when it comes to renting.\n\nManhattan recently ranked among the five most competitive rental markets in the country, with new leases in June commanding a record median rent of $4,625, The Post reported.\n\nAbout 70% of tenants renewed their leases in the first quarter of 2025, leaving slim pickings for newcomers. Apartments that did hit the market attracted an average of 11 interested renters apiece, up from seven a year earlier.",

      "text": "One of Israel\u2019s greatest artists asks $19M for her rare NYC home \u2014 and it stands to sell for the first time in decades\nHome is where the art is.\nThe celebrated Israeli artist Ilana Goor \u2014 whose seaside residence and museum in Jaffa, south of Tel Aviv, is filled to the brim with her curiosities for all visitors to explore \u2014 has put her New York City home back on the market for $19 million.\nBuilt in 1903, Goor and her husband, Leonard Lowengrub, have owned the 6,600-square-foot residence since the 1970s. Not only does this mark the first time in decades for the property to turn a new chapter, but \u2014 being a carriage house \u2014 it\u2019s a rare dwelling to get.\nNew York\u2019s carriage houses are disappearing relics, with some 75 still in existence, and few rise beyond two or three stories. At 178 E. 75th St., however, Goor\u2019s stands defiantly taller.\nIts return to market also marks a dramatic reduction from its original $37.75 million ask.\nOver the years, Goor \u2014 a sculptor and designer whose work is also displayed in museums around the world \u2014 used the space as both a private home and exhibition hall, similar to what she has in Israel, layering modern interventions over exposed brick, skylights and iron.\nCurbed once described the interiors as \u201cteeming with the widest possible range of eccentric art,\u201d from medieval-style tapestries to rainbow abstractions and even a pink-and-blue sheep perched atop built-ins.\nListing agent Smitha Ramchandani of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate said the home defies easy categorization.\n\u201cIt\u2019s such an extraordinary carriage home. It\u2019s truly rare to be on that block,\u201d she told The Post. \u201cIt offers a blend of the historic charm and modern luxury. It has an elevator and it also has about 1,200 square feet of rooftop, which is extremely rare to have that in a townhome.\u201d\nGoor spearheaded an ambitious renovation that added floors, a primary suite level and a rooftop terrace designed for entertaining.\n\u201cShe designed the whole thing,\u201d Ramchandani noted. \u201cThey added and redid the whole townhouse. So the design of it was having levels of privacy in her home and her entertainment, which is the kitchen, the living room and the dining room is basically where she practically lives.\u201d\nThe layout reflects that vision: a dramatic gallery with 22-foot ceilings adjoins a three-car drive-in garage.\nAbove, a solarium-style living room opens to a south-facing garden, while the entire fifth floor is devoted to a master suite complete with dual walk-in closets, a fireplace and roof access.\nWellness amenities include a sauna, gym, and lounge in the English basement, while terraces and the 1,200-square-foot roof deck provides outdoor retreats.\nThe townhouse is also a reflection of Goor\u2019s wider career.\nHer home in Jaffa operates as the Ilana Goor Museum, where works by Giacometti and Albers mingle with her own industrial bronzes and welded furniture.\nAt East 75th Street, that same eclectic spirit has left its mark, with Ramchandani recalling that \u201cwhen you come into this home, your eyes will never rest just because you see such beautiful things around.\u201d\nFor decades, the couple hosted prime ministers and presidents here. Photographs displayed throughout the home capture meetings with world leaders and celebrities alike.\nAt 89 and 93, Goor and Lowengrub are reluctantly parting with the property.\n\u201cThey are coming to a different phase in their lives,\u201d Ramchandani explained. \u201cWith their age, they\u2019re at a point in their lives where they have to let go, but it\u2019s very hard for them to. But at some point in your life, you can\u2019t fight time.\u201d\nShe describes the property as \u201cthe love house\u201d because of the couple\u2019s enduring partnership.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much love between them and when you see them and when you talk to them, it\u2019s just incredible,\u201d she said. \u201cYou feel amazing energy in this home.\u201d\nDespite its artistic and personal history, the home has struggled to find a buyer in the past.\nAttempts to sell in 2007, 2008, and 2013 were unsuccessful, StreetEasy records show.\nThe current price cut reflects both market realities and the owners\u2019 readiness to move forward.\n\u201cThis is not just real estate,\u201d Ramchandani said. \u201cThis is a jewel, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own something rare, historic and deeply inspiring.\u201d"

      "text": "Furious homeowner says her insurance company flew a drone over her house and refused renewal \u2014 for 1 minor reason\nWhen Lynne Schueler looked up at the branches of a beloved tree in her Massachusetts yard, she never expected that a drone might be looking down on her.\nSchueler, who had held a policy with the same insurer for more than a decade, was shocked to receive an email containing an aerial photo of her home and a warning that she had six weeks to cut back limbs hanging over her roof \u2014 or lose her coverage.\n\u201cIt was very invasive, because they had taken a picture of my house without me knowing, which was really kind of crazy,\u201d she told CBS News Boston in an interview.\nThe longtime policyholder said she felt trapped: removing the branches cost $1,200, but losing coverage could have jeopardized her mortgage.\n\u201cI had insurance with this company for the last 12 years, with no claims,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a good customer to them.\u201d\nIndustry critics say Schueler\u2019s experience is increasingly common as insurers adopt aerial imaging to assess risk.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s becoming very, very common,\u201d Amy Bach, executive director of consumer group United Policyholders, told CBS.\nShe added that insurers are now dropping customers based on images that show \u201cmold on your roof,\u201d \u201cdamaged roof tiles\u201d or \u201ctrees touching your house.\u201d\nOther homeowners across the country have faced similar surprises.\nMike Arman, near Daytona Beach, Fla., previously told the Daily Mail he was twice \u201cspied on\u201d by insurers despite not having made a claim in 52 years.\nHe recalled being told his roof had problems based on satellite footage which \u201clooked like it was taken in 1936,\u201d and said the company \u201crefused to come and see his home in person\u201d despite being located just three miles away.\nIn California, longtime customer Joan Van Kuren told CBS she was stunned when her insurer of almost four decades dropped her after a drone captured what it labeled \u201chazardous\u201d renovation clutter.\nInsurers contend that aerial photos are less intrusive than sending adjusters to homes. Lawmakers, however, are beginning to push back.\nIn Massachusetts, State Rep. David LeBoeuf has introduced legislation that would require companies to provide homeowners with copies of any photos taken, noting on social media that the bill \u201cwould give homeowners date stamped copies of the images and an opportunity to repair any identified damages or identify errors in the findings of the image analysis.\u201d\nCalifornia Assemblymember Lisa Calderon has advanced a similar proposal, warning that \u201cwe are in the middle of an insurance crisis and Californians are facing nonrenewals or policy cancellations, sometimes without justification,\u201d in a press release.\nShe said constituents \u201cdeserve to have access to important information regarding the coverage of one of their most valuable assets.\u201d\nBut advocates argue these efforts still fall short.\n\u201cThis can be done through time stamps on aerial images and set timeframes on how old they can be,\u201d Emily Rogan, senior program officer at United Policyholders, said.\nShe added that customers should \u201chave the chance to correct misinformation or errors and stay insured.\u201d\nFor Schueler, whose branches were cut just in time to keep her policy, the experience has left a lasting unease.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t home because my car wasn\u2019t in the driveway,\u201d she said. \u201cIt ended up costing $1,200. I had no choice.\u201d"

      "text": "Real-estate mogul Barbara Corcoran sold her Fifth Avenue penthouse in just one day in May \u2014 and it appears her next-door neighbor took note of the success.\nAn 11-room penthouse alongside Corcoran\u2019s former pad listed for $11.5 million this week, according to a StreetEasy listing update.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the rare Fifth Avenue duplex has attempted to sell, but if Corcoran\u2019s recent deal is anything to go by, it might not be on the market for long.\nThe Upper East Side home is perched atop the 15th floor of 1158 Fifth Ave., a white-glove co-op circa 1924.\nThe prewar building, located at Fifth Avenue and 97th Street, boasts Central Park and city skyline views.\nThe listing, held by Linda Maloney of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, calls the home\u2019s wraparound terrace its \u201ccrown jewel.\u201d\nThe listing advertises five bedrooms and five full bathrooms, including a primary bedroom with a private terrace. The sprawling residence also features an eat-in chef\u2019s kitchen and a formal dining room.\nAmenities include ample built-ins, laundry rooms on both floors and two fireplaces \u2014 one gas, one woodburning.\nThe fresh listing comes less than four months after the home\u2019s high-profile neighbor listed and sold her similarly well-appointed home in less than 24 hours.\nCorcoran, founder of the Corcoran Group, purchased the duplex next-door for $10 million in 2015, according to city records. She undertook extensive renovations of the 4,600-square-foot aerie, including flipping the floor plan, installing a chef\u2019s kitchen and transforming her terrace greenhouse into a dining area.\nThe $12 million asking price was below her total investment, the New York Times reported. Corcoran told the outlet that she \u201cnever thought\u201d she would leave. She has since relocated to a one-story apartment in the same Carnegie Hill neighborhood.\nCorcoran\u2019s penthouse remains in contract, so its eager buyer and their final price remain under wraps until the sale officially closes.\nThe newly listed duplex was purchased in 2005 for $3.01 million, according to city records. The owners tried to sell for $8.9 million in 2010, according to StreetEasy, but they ultimately removed the listing after 6 months.\nBoth homes atop the 1158 Fifth Ave. edifice enjoy a 24-hour doorman and concierge, a live-in resident manager, a fitness center and bike storage \u2014 but if you can get views like this, you can probably afford a cab."

      "text": "Here\u2019s how many renters compete for 1 NYC apartment \u2014 but it\u2019s worse elsewhere in the nation\nSurprise, surprise: Manhattan currently ranks among the top five most competitive rental markets in the country.\nThe Big Apple rose the ranks of RentCafe\u2019s most recent report on rental competitiveness nationwide. Manhattan is currently the fifth most competitive rental market in the country, according to the data. Demand is high, turnover is low and vacancies are brief.\nIt\u2019s the rental market that never sleeps.\nManhattan\u2019s median rent reached another record high in June, according to a report by appraiser Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman, marking the fourth broken record in five months.\nNot only was the median rent on a new Manhattan lease a whopping $4,625 last month, but the competition for these units is fiercer than ever.\nIn Manhattan, 25% of rentals incurred bidding wars in June \u2014 a fraught process typically reserved for homeowners.\nMore than half of Manhattan renters understandably chose to stay put in the first quarter of 2025, according to RentCafe\u2019s analysis of Yardi data. Lease renewals reached 70% in that period. Fewer vacant apartments meant crowded open houses \u2014 11 renters were competing for each open apartment, the report found. That\u2019s an increase from just seven renters pet unit during the same period last year.\nThe high-pressure environment is resulting in vacant apartments leaving the market five days faster than the same period last year, resulting in the typical rental unit spending an average of 45 days for rent.\nManhattan certainly isn\u2019t the only city where renters are feeling the heat. Miami renters are facing far greater competition for housing, according to RentCafe. The Sunshine State\u2019s largest city boasts an occupancy rate of 96.6% in the first quarter of 2025, with 21 prospective renters per unit and average vacancies of just over a month.\nSuburban Chicago and Broward County, Florida took second and third places, followed by Eastern Los Angeles and suburban Philadelphia.\nFierce competition for rentals in Florida locales like Miami and Broward County contrast sharply with reports of stalling home sales across the state. Broward County saw an 18% year-over-year decline in home sales and a 24% drop in condo closings in May, according to recent data from the Miami Association of Realtors.\nHomebuyer hesitancy extends from the Floridian coast to the Big Apple.\n\u201cWith high mortgage rates and economic uncertainty, renting is looking more attractive than buying for many people right now,\u201d said Doug Ressler, manager of business intelligence at Yardi Matrix, which provides data to RentCafe."
