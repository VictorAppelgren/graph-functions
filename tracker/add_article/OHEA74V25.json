      "summary": "The piece argues that President Trump’s recent attempts to impose federal control over state police, bail policies, and flag‑burning laws exceed the Constitution’s limited federal powers and violate the 10th Amendment’s reservation of police power to the states. Drawing on Madison’s principle of subsidiarity and Supreme Court rulings in U.S. v. Lopez and Printz, the author stresses that public‑safety matters remain primarily state jurisdiction. The article cites Reagan’s inaugural remarks and Scalia’s rulings on flag‑burning to illustrate the enduring tension between federal authority and state sovereignty. Andrew P. Napolitano, a former New Jersey judge, uses the piece to defend state autonomy and warn against expanding presidential power.",
