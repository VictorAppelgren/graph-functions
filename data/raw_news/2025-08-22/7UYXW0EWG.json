      "text": "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s love was on full display during her August 13 appearance on his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast. In between the story of how she got her masters back in May, backstage secrets of her Eras Tour and the announcement of her new album, The Life of a Showgirl, Swift and Kelce \u2014 seated close together and often affectionate during the two-hour pre-recorded show \u2014 revealed intimate insights into their two-year relationship. Swift recalled how Kelce\u2019s \u201cwild, romantic gesture\u201d of shouting her out on the podcast in July 2023 made her feel like she was in \u201can \u201980s John Hughes movie,\u201d while Kelce gushed about Swift\u2019s brains and talents and repeatedly referred to himself as \u201cthe luckiest man in the world.\u201d The podcast episode garnered a record-breaking 10 million views in 16 hours.\nIt\u2019s been an eventful summer for the pair. Just three weeks prior to her appearance on \u201cNew Heights,\u201d Swifties were thrown into a frenzy after Kelce finally shared photos of his superstar girlfriend on Instagram. The Kansas City Chiefs tight end posted a carousel of intimate pics featuring him and Swift in a variety of settings (wearing matching black at an upscale restaurant, posing with pal Erin Andrews in the snow, sipping wine in the mountains, skating on an ice rink) alongside a caption that read: \u201cHad some adventures this offseason, kept it 100.\u201d They\u2019ve been spotted holding hands on romantic dinner dates in NYC, taking in an NHL championship game in Florida and attending a wedding in Knoxville, Tennessee.\nThe past few months have been the longest stretch of uninterrupted time that Swift and Kelce, both 35, have had together since they began dating. Swift spent much of the last two years on the road for her 149-date Eras Tour (which wrapped in December) while Kelce played in two Super Bowls with his team and worked on numerous film and TV projects, including the Prime Video game show Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity? and Happy Gilmore 2.\nAccording to sources, much-needed quality time has proven to both Swift and Kelce that they have what it takes to go all the way \u2014 and clearly the confidence to publicly fawn over one another like never before. \u201cTaylor and Travis have settled into a real rhythm as a couple, and the more time they spend together, the more they realize how aligned they are,\u201d says a source. (\u201cWhenever I\u2019m with her, it feels like we\u2019re just regular people,\u201d Kelce told GQ in his September cover story. \u201cWhen there is not a camera on us, we\u2019re just two people that are in love.\u201d) Adds a second source: \u201cDuring this downtime, they really noticed all the little things they have in common. They feel like they\u2019ve found their person.\u201d\nOn the Same Page\nThe pair had gone into virtual hiding following Kelce\u2019s shocking Super Bowl loss in early February. In March, a source told Us they had made a \u201cvery deliberate\u201d decision to take a step back from the public eye. They hunkered down at Swift\u2019s $50 million Manhattan penthouse and later Kelce\u2019s $20 million rental in Boca Raton, Florida, where the tight end had been training for his upcoming season with the Chiefs. \u201cThe break came at the right [moment],\u201d says the second source. \u201cTaylor needed to spend more time with Travis [so they could really] get to know each other.\u201d\nEven they were a little surprised by how well they gel. \u201cThey found a lot of common ground they were not expecting, and it made their relationship stronger,\u201d says the second source, noting that the 14-time Grammy winner and the future Hall of Famer \u201chave found their counterpart in terms of ambition, work ethic and values.\u201d Kelce told GQ: \u201cWe are two fun-loving people who have the morals to appreciate everyone for who they are. We share all those values.\u201d\nTheir lifestyles are in sync. \u201cAthletes have a different mindset; they are more disciplined, and it\u2019s very similar to Taylor\u2019s mindset,\u201d the second source says. \u201cShe will never tell anyone that she is an athlete,\u201d Kelce told GQ, \u201cbut I\u2019ve seen what she goes through. I\u2019ve seen the amount of work that she puts on her body, and it\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201d The source adds: \u201cThere are a lot of parallels, and they have really connected on that level with eating and working out.\u201d\nDespite their celebrity status, Swift and Kelce are both down-to-earth and known for being approachable to fans. \u201cThey are very empathetic people. Meeting someone like that is a dream come true for them,\u201d the second source says. Kelce likened Swift to his mom, Donna, in GQ, praising their kindness and ability to \u201csay hello to everyone in the room\u201d and \u201cshow love and support no matter what.\u201d\nSwift has met her match when it comes to romance. \u201cShe leaves Travis love notes and buys sentimental gifts, and he does the same thing,\u201d the second source shares, adding that the \u201cKarma\u201d singer \u201cnever experienced that in a partner before Travis.\u201d Things with Kelce are lighter and more fun compared to Swift\u2019s previous relationships. \u201cTravis has the best personality,\u201d says the first source. \u201cTaylor thinks he\u2019s hilarious and is never bored with him.\u201d\nWhen they\u2019re not enjoying dates across the U.S. (the pair were spotted having dinner at Harry\u2019s in West Palm Beach in May, hitting up members\u2019 club San Vicente West Village in downtown Manhattan in June and visiting JoJo\u2019s Bar near Kelce\u2019s Ohio hometown in July) they\u2019re doing ordinary couple things like watching movies and cooking. Notes the second source, \u201cTaylor has been loving the quiet, normal days with Travis.\u201d\nBack to Business\nSoon, Kelce will be back on the field for his 13th, and potentially final, NFL season. \u201cI just have such a motivation to show up this year for my guys,\u201d Kelce told GQ. (\u201cThis may be his last [season],\u201d an insider told Us in June, \u201cso he\u2019s giving it his all.\u201d) Swift is \u201cincredibly supportive,\u201d says the first source, noting that she\u2019s become \u201cobsessed\u201d with football. \u201cShe is the most engulfed fan now. She knows what the injury reports look like,\u201d Kelce told GQ, adding that Swift even adopted his signature first down finger pointing gesture on stage. \u201cI became a person who was running through the halls of my house screaming, \u2018We drafted Xavier Worthy,\u2019\u201d Swift admitted on \u201cNew Heights\u201d, referring to the Chiefs\u2019 first-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. \u201cMy friends were like, \u2018What? Who body snatched you?\u2019\u201d\nThe source adds that the singer \u201cloves\u201d going to games, where she hangs out with Kelce\u2019s family and the other WAGs. She\u2019s become especially close with QB and Kelce bestie Patrick Mahomes\u2019 wife, Brittany, and Chariah Gordon, who\u2019s engaged to former Chiefs wide receiver Mecole Hardman Jr., revealed that Swift knitted their baby daughter a blanket.\nFootball will coincide with press for The Life of a Showgirl, which Swift recorded during the European leg of her tour with producers Max Martin and Shellback. \u201cWe knew that we had to bring the best ideas we\u2019ve ever had, and I also know the pressure I\u2019m putting on this record by saying that, but I don\u2019t care because I love it that much,\u201d Swift gushed on \u201cNew Heights.\u201d Of course, Kelce is already a fan, promising listeners that every track on the new album is a \u201cbanger\u201d and is going to make people dance. \u201cShe\u2019s constantly creating,\u201d says the first source of the singer. \u201cIt\u2019s in her nature.\u201d\nTotally Committed\nIf there were any doubts about their long-term potential as a couple, this summer (and the Instagram post, and the podcast\u2026) put them to rest. \u201cThis time together solidified Taylor knowing that she wants to be with Travis forever,\u201d says the second source. The first source adds that Swift and Kelce are \u201con the same page\u201d when it comes to settling down. \u201cThey want to be married and have kids in the future,\u201d notes the source. \u201cThey\u2019re both genuinely ready for that chapter.\u201d\nFor more on Swift and Kelce, watch the exclusive video above and pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly \u2014 on newsstands now."
