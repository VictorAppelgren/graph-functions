  "description": "It's staying, but being simplified",
  "content": "The Camera Control button on the iPhone 16 (on the right)\n\u2022 Apple may stick with the Camera Control button\n\u2022 Previous rumors suggested it wouldn't be on the iPhone 18\n\u2022 We may see a simpler button on future iPhones\n\nLast week we heard a rumor that the iPhone 17 would be the last to sport the Camera Control, which was only introduced last year with the iPhone 16 \u2013 but a fresh leak suggests the button will live on, albeit in a different form.\n\nThe new rumor comes from well-known tipster Instant Digital (via MacRumors), which states that Camera Control components are in production for the iPhone 18. That refutes the idea that Apple would get rid of it as it's not seeing a lot of use.\n\nThere is a twist though: Apple is apparently removing the capacitive sensor next year to cut down on costs. That's the sensor that detects any kind of touch or swipe, enabling users to gradually change settings like exposure or zoom.\n\nThat will leave only the pressure sensor, detecting distinct touches of different strengths. We'll have to wait and see how that might affect the different functions of Camera Control \u2013 some of them might be remapped or replaced, with the help of iOS.\n\nWhen the Camera Control was introduced with the iPhone 16 models, Apple described it as a feature that \"elevates the camera experience\" and which is \"packed with innovation\" \u2013 offering easier access to various camera controls and Visual Intelligence.\n\nIn our iPhone 16 review, we described it as \"major enhancement\" for the Apple handsets, and in fact the \"best addition\" to the 2024 handsets. However, it didn't make an appearance on the iPhone 16e that Apple launched the following February.\n\nDespite our enthusiasm for the small button, it's fair to say the reaction overall has been mixed. Some have struggled to find a real purpose for the Camera Control, but it seems that some time and effort investment is required to make the most of it.\n\nWhat seems clear is that we'll get the standard Camera Control button back again with all four iPhone 17 handsets in September \u2013 including, if the leaks are to be believed, the iPhone 17 Air that's supposedly replacing the iPhone 16 Plus this year.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 I found the best use for Camera Control\n\u2022 These are the best iPhones you can buy right now\n\u2022 The iPhone 17 could cost $50 more",

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nForget the iPhone SE; the iPhone 16e represents a whole new class of affordable iPhone. It has an excellent screen, powerful performance, a cutting-edge CPU with Apple Intelligence, and even an all-new C1 modem chip. It's also a bit of a frustrating conundrum. Apple has raised the price to the point where it's almost out of budget range, but it hasn't added a second camera, and it's brought back the notch. Ultimately, this is another great iPhone \u2013 but it may not be the best choice if you're looking for a 'budget' phone.\nPros\n- +\nModern design\n- +\nVersatile Action button\n- +\nNew C1 chip\nCons\n- -\nThe notch is back\n- -\n2x zoom is just a crop\n- -\nNo MagSafe\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nApple iPhone 16e: Two-Minute Review\nThe iPhone 16e is a good phone. It has a pleasing design, and it feels like a true member of the iPhone 16 family. It is not a great phone, though \u2013 how could it be with a retro notch in the Super Retina XDR display and just a single 48MP camera?\nThere are 'budget' phones that cost far less and which have larger screens and multiple rear cameras. They're not iOS handsets, and that counts for something \u2013 any new iPhone joins an expansive and well-designed ecosystem offering connective tissue between excellent Apple services and other Apple hardware. I mostly live in that world now, and I appreciate how well my iPhone 16 Pro Max works with, for instance, my Mac, and how all my cloud-connected services know it's me on the line.\nIt's been a while since I've had such conflicting feelings about an iPhone. I appreciate that Apple thought it was time to move away from the iPhone SE design language, one that owed most of its look and feel to 2017's iPhone 8. I'm sure Apple couldn't wait to do away with the Lightning port and the Home button with Touch ID (which lives on in Macs and some iPads). But instead of giving us something fresh, Apple took a bit of this and a bit of that to cobble together the iPhone 16e.\nThe display is almost the best Apple has to offer if you can ignore the notch, aren't bothered by larger bezels, and don't miss the Dynamic Island too much. The main 48MP Fusion camera is very good and shoots high-quality stills and videos, but don't be fooled by the claims of 2x zoom, which is actually a 12MP crop on the middle of the 48MP sensor. I worry that people paying $599 / \u00a3599 / AU$999 for this phone will be a little frustrated that they're not at least getting a dedicated ultra-wide camera at that price.\nConversely, there is one bit of this iPhone 16e that's not only new but is, for the moment, unique among iPhone 16 devices: the C1 chip. I don't know why Apple's cheapest iPhone got this brand-new bit of Apple silicon, but it does a good job of delivering 5G and even satellite connectivity. Plus, it starts moving Apple out from under the yolk of Qualcomm, Apple's cellular modem chip frenemy. That relationship has been fraught for years, and I wonder if Apple had originally hoped to put the C1 in all iPhone 16 models but the development schedule slipped.\nIn any case, while it's hard to measure the connectivity benefits (it's another good 5G modem), Apple says this is the most efficient cellular modem it's ever put in an iPhone (that seems like a swipe at Qualcomm), and helps to deliver stellar battery life: a claimed 26 hours of video streaming. Battery life in real-world use will, naturally, be a different story.\nOn balance, I like this phone's performance (courtesy of the A18 chip and 8GB of RAM), its looks, and how it feels in the hand (a matte glass back and Ceramic Shield front), and I think iOS 18 with Apple Intelligence is well-thought-out and increasingly intelligent (though Siri remains a bit of a disappointment); but if you're shopping for a sub-$600 phone, there may be other even better choices from the likes of Google (Pixel 8a), OnePlus (OnePlus 13R) and the anticipated Samsung Galaxy S25 FE. You just have to be willing to leave the Apple bubble.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nApple iPhone 16e: Price and availability\nApple unveiled the iPhone 16e on February 19, 2025. It joins the iPhone 16 lineup, and starts at $599 / \u00a3599 / AU$999 with 128GB of storage, making it the most affordable smartphone of the bunch. It's available in black or white.\nWhile some might consider the iPhone 16e to be the successor to the iPhone SE 3, it has little in common with that device. In particular, that was a $429 phone. At $599, Apple might be stretching the definition of budget, but it is $200 cheaper than the base iPhone 16. The phone's price compares somewhat less favorably outside the iOS sphere. The OnePlus 13R for instance is a 6.7-inch handset with three cameras, and the Google Pixel 8a matches the iPhone 16e's 6.1-inch screen size (though at a lower resolution), but also includes two rear cameras.\nYou won't find more affordable new phones in the iOS space. The iPhone 15 has the main and ultra-wide camera and the Dynamic Island, but it costs $699 / \u00a3699 / AU$1,249. A refurbished iPhone 14 costs $529, but neither it nor the iPhone 15 supports Apple Intelligence.\n- Value score: 4/5\nApple iPhone 16e: Specs\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | iPhone 16 |\n|---|---|\nDimensions: | 146.7 x 71.5 x 7.8mm |\nWeight: | 167g |\nDisplay: | 6.1-inch OLED |\nResolution: | 2532 x 1170 pixels |\nRefresh rate: | 60Hz |\nChipset: | A18 |\nRear cameras: | 48MP main (26mm, f/1.6) |\nFront camera: | 12MP (f/1.9) |\nStorage: | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB |\nApple iPhone 16e: Design\n- No trace of the iPhone SE design remains\n- Hybrid iPhone 14/15 design\n- Sharper edges than the current iPhone 16 design\nThere's no question that the iPhone 16e is a part of the iPhone 16 family. At a glance, especially when the screen is off, it's almost a dead ringer for the base model; the aerospace aluminum fame is only slightly smaller.\nUpon closer examination, those similarities recede, and I can see the myriad differences that make this a true hybrid design. This is now the only iPhone with a single camera, which almost looks a little lonely on the matte glass back. The edges of the metal band that wraps around the body are noticeably sharper than those of any other iPhone 16, but the phone still feels good in the hand.\nThe button configuration is essentially what you'd find on an iPhone 15. There's the power / sleep / Siri button on the right, and on the left are the two volume buttons and the Action button. Unlike the rest of the iPhone 16 lineup the 16e doesn't get the Camera Control, but at least the Action button is configurable, so you can set it to activate the camera or toggle the Flashlight, Silent Mode, Voice Memo, and more. I set mine to launch Visual Intelligence, an Apple Intelligence feature: you press and hold the Action button once to open it, and press again to grab a photo, and then you can select on-screen if you want ChatGPT or Google Search to handle the query. Apple Intelligence can also analyze the image directly and identify the subject.\nThe phone is iP68 rated to handle water and dust, including a dunk in six meters of water for 30 minutes. The screen is protected with a Ceramic Shield to better protect it from drops, though I'm not sure it does much to prevent scratches.\nI put a case on the phone, never dropped it, and handled it gingerly, and yet within a day I noticed a long scratch on the screen, although I have no recollection of brushing the display against anything. I had a similar situation with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra; I await the phone that can handle life in my pocket (empty other than the phone) without sustaining a scratch.\nOverall, if you like the looks of the iPhone 16 lineup (or even the iPhone 14 and 15 lineups) the iPhone 16e will not disappoint.\n- Design score: 4 / 5\nApple iPhone 16e: Display\n- Almost Apple's best smartphone display\n- The notch is back\n- The bezels are a little bigger\nIf you're coming from the iPhone SE to the iPhone 16E, you're in for quite a shock. This 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED screen is nothing like the 4.7-inch LCD display on that now-retired design.\nThe iPhone 16e features a lovely edge-to-edge design \u2013 with slightly larger bezels than you'll find on other iPhone 16 phones \u2013 that leaves no room for the dearly departed Touch ID Home button. Instead, this phone adopts the Face ID biometric security, which is, as far as I'm concerned, probably the best smartphone face recognition in the business. Face ID lives in the TrueDepth camera system notch, which also accommodates, among other things, the 12MP front-facing camera, microphone, and proximity sensor.\nWhile I never had a big problem with the notch, I can't say I'm thrilled to see it return here. The rest of the iPhone 16 lineup features the versatile Dynamic Island, which I think most would agree is preferable to this cutout.\nThe iPhone 16e shares the iPhone 16's 460ppi resolution, but it does lose a few pixels (2532 x 1170 versus 2556 x 1179 for the iPhone 16). It still supports True Tone, Wide color (P3), and a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio. The only area where it loses a bit of oomph is on the brightness front. Peak brightness for HDR content is 1,200 nits, and all other content is 800nits. The iPhone 16's peak outdoor brightness is 2,000 nits. As with other non-pro models, the refresh rate on the iPhone 16e sits at a fixed 60Hz.\nEven so, I had no trouble viewing the iPhone 16e screen in a wide variety of lighting situations, and any shortcomings are only evident in the brightest, direct sunlight.\nIn day-to-day use, everything from photos and video to AAA games, apps, and websites looks great on this display. Colors are bright and punchy, and the blacks are inky. I'm not distracted by the notch on games, where it can cut a bit into the gameplay view, and most video streaming defaults to a letterbox format that steers clear of it, with black bars on the left and right sides of the screen.\n- Display score: 4 / 5\nApple iPhone 16e: Software and Apple Intelligence\n- iOS 18 is a rich and well-thought-out platform\n- Apple Intelligence has some impressive features, but we await the Siri of our dreams\n- Mail and photo redesigns leave something to be desired\niOS 18 is now smarter, more proactive, and more customizable than ever before. I can transform every app icon from 'Light' to 'Tinted' (monochromatic), fill my home screen with widgets, and expand them until they almost fill the screen. This customizability carries through to the Control Center, which is now a multi-page affair that I can leave alone, or completely reorganize so the tools I care about are available with a quick swipe down from the upper-right corner.\nApple Intelligence, which Apple unveiled last June, is growing in prominence and utility. It lives across apps like Messages and Email in Writing Tools, which is a bit buried so I often forget it exists. It's in notification summaries that can be useful for at-a-glance action but which are sometimes a bit confusing, and in image-generation tools like Image Playground and Genmojis.\nIt's also in Visual intelligence, which, as have it set up, gives me one-button access to ChatGPT and Google Search.\nI think I prefer the more utilitarian features of Apple Intelligence like Clean Up. It lets you quickly remove people and objects from photos as if they were never there in the first place.\nI'm also a fan of Audio Mix, which is not a part of Apple Intelligence, but uses machine learning to clean up the messiest audio to make it usable in social media, podcasts, or just for sharing with friends.\niOS 18 also features updated Photos and Mail apps with Apple Intelligence. I've struggled a bit with how Photos reorganized my images, and I've had similar issues with how Mail is now reorganizing my emails. I hope Apple takes another run at these apps in iOS 19.\nSiri is smarter and more aware of iPhone features than before. It can handle my vocal missteps, and still knows what I want, but remains mostly unaware of my on-device information, and feels far less conversational and powerful as a chatbot than Google Gemini and ChatGPT.\n- Software score: 4.5 / 5\nApple iPhone 16e: Camera\n- 48MP Fusion is a good camera\n- The front-facing camera shines as well\n- A single rear camera at this price is disappointing\nWith a more powerful CPU, a bigger screen, and the new C1 chip, I can almost understand why Apple set the iPhone 16e price as high as it did. Almost\u2026 until I consider the single, rear 48MP Fusion camera. Most smartphones in this price range feature at least two lenses, and usually the second one is an ultra-wide \u2013 without that lens you miss out on not only dramatic ultra-wide shots but also macro photography capabilities. Had Apple priced this camera at $499, I might understand.\nStill, I like this camera. It defaults to shooting in 24MP, which is a bin of the 48MP available on the sensor (two pixels for each single image pixel to double the image information). There's a 2x zoom option, which is useful, but it's only shooting at 12MP because it's only using the central 12 megapixels from the full 48MP frame. These images are still good, but just not the same resolution as the default or what you could get shooting full-frame.\nOverall, the camera shoots lovely photos with exquisite detail and the kind of color fidelity I appreciate (in people and skies especially) in a wide variety of scenarios. I captured excellent still lifes, portraits, and night-mode shots. I was also impressed with the front camera, which is especially good for portrait-mode selfies. Much of this image quality is thanks to the work Apple has done on its Photonic Engine. Apple's computational image pipeline pulls out extraordinary detail and nuance in most photographic situations, even if it is for just these two cameras.\niPhone 16e camera samples\n- Camera score: 4 / 5\nApple iPhone 16e: Performance\n- The A18 is an excellent and powerful CPU\n- It's ready for Apple Intelligence\n- C1, Apple's first cellular modem, is effective for 5G and satellite connectivity\nIf you're wondering why the successor to the iPhone SE is not a $429 smartphone, you might look at the processing combo of the powerful A18 and the new C1.\nThe A18 is the same chip you'll find in the iPhone 16, with the exception of one fewer GPU core. I promise you'll never notice the difference.\nPerformance scores are excellent, and in line with the numbers we got for other A18 chips (and slightly lower than what you get from the A18 Pro in the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max).\nThe A18 has more than enough power not just for day-to-day tasks like email and web browsing, but for 4K video editing (which I did in CapCut) and AAA gaming (game mode turns on automatically to divert more resources toward gaming). I played Asphalt 9 United, Resident Evil 4, and Call of Duty Mobile, and made things easier for myself by connecting my Xbox controller. My only criticism would be that a 6.1-inch screen is a little tight for these games. The audio from the stereo speakers, by the way, is excellent \u2013 I get an impressive spatial audio experience with Resident Evil 4.\nThere's also the new C1 chip, which is notable because it's Apple's first custom cellular mobile chip. Previously Apple relied on, among other partners, Qualcomm for this silicon. I didn't notice any difference in connectivity with the new chip, which is a good thing \u2013 and I was impressed that I could use text via satellite.\nI didn't think I'd get to test this feature, but AT&T connectivity is so bad in my New York neighborhood that the SOS icon appeared at the top of my iPhone 16e screen, and next to it I noticed the satellite icon. I opened messages, and the phone asked if I wanted to use the Satellite texting feature. I held the phone near my screen door to get a clear view of the sky, and followed the on-display guide that told me which way to point the phone. I got a 'Connected' notification, and then sent a few SMS texts over satellite. It's a nifty feature, and it was a nice little test of the C1's capabilities.\n- Performance score: 5 / 5\nApple iPhone 16e: Battery\n- Long lasting\n- Wireless charging\n- No MagSafe\nIt's clear that Apple has prioritized battery life on the iPhone 16e over some other features. That would likely explain, for instance, why we have wireless charging but not MagSafe support \u2013 adding that magnetic ring might have eaten into battery space. The C1 chip is apparently smaller than the modem chip in other iPhone 16 models, and even the decision to include one camera instead of two probably helped make room for what is a larger battery than even the one in the iPhone 16.\nApple rates the iPhone 16e for 26 hours of video-rundown battery life \u2013 that's about four hours more than the iPhone 16. In my real-world testing the battery life has been very good, but varied use can run the battery down in far fewer than 26 hours.\nOn one day when I did everything from email and web browsing to social media consumption and then a lot of gaming, battery life was about 12 hours \u2013 gaming in particular really chewed through the battery and made the phone pretty warm.\nMy own video rundown test (I played through episodes of Better Call Saul on Netflix) returned about 24 hours of battery life.\nI used a 65W USB-C charger to charge the phone to 57% in 30 minutes, with a full charge taking about one hour and 50 minutes. I also tried a 20W charger, which charged the phone to 50% in 30 minutes.\n- Battery score: 5 / 5\nShould you buy the Apple iPhone 16e?\niPhone 16e score card\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\nValue | Since this is now Apple's new budget phone you might expect either a lower price, or more for its considerably higher price.

      "text": "This \u2018meh\u2019 iPhone 17 Air camera tip might give us more insight than meets the eye\n- A 'leaked' image shows a screen protector for the iPhone 17 family\n- And the iPhone 17 Air has a standout change with a left-oriented selfie camera\n- This dull tip could hint at more than meets the eye\nThe iPhone 17 Air has been tipped to have a front-facing camera on the left-hand side of the Dynamic Island that the rumored super-slim phone is expected to have.\nThis comes courtesy of tipster Majin Bu, who has a habit of surfacing claimed leaks taken from Chinese social media on X, often with a mixed track record of accuracy. Bu posted an image of screen protectors that are supposedly for the iPhone 17 lineup.\nThese images are hardly dynamic and don't hint at big design changes for the next-generation iPhones. But for an image labelled 'IP17Air', the front-facing camera has been shifted from the right-hand side of the Dynamic Island (as seen on the iPhone 16 models and expected for their next-gen counterparts) to the left.\nNow, before you yawn yourself off this article, let me explain why it could be more interesting than you think.\nMoving a camera isn't a big deal, especially as Apple would likely make sure iOS 26 takes this into account when using the likes of the reworked camera app to snap selfies and so on.\nBut Apple tends to rarely do things for the sake of it or just for a bit of design flair. Rather, I think this change could be a clue as to how Cupertino might have reworked the internal layout of its iPhones to produce a super-slim variant of a next-gen Apple phone.\nFormula iPhone\nIf you happen to follow Formula One \u2013 which, as it happens, Apple has made a movie about \u2013 you'll know that how components in an F1 car are packaged is vital to getting the most performance out of a car; in terms of aerodynamics, weight distribution, weight, and so on. The rules of F1 mean that there are limitations to how much can be changed with each team's car to ensure that one doesn't have an unfair advantage over the others.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAnd I think the same logic can be applied from an F1 car to making super-slim phones, well, to an extent, so bear with me.\nThis is because consumers have certain expectations from phones \u2013 especially those from the biggest brands \u2013 such as decent performance, rear- and front-facing cameras, a solid battery life, and a decent display. And given phones have basically got somewhat iterative generation-to-generation, there are arguably limitations to what can be done to make a phone slim and light without too many compromises.\nAs such, this tipped camera reposition in the Dynamic Island is a potential hint that Apple is working to package the internal components and structures of the iPhone 17 Air in such a way as to make it seriously slim.\nGiven Samsung beat Apple to the punch with the Galaxy S25 Edge, I think Tim Cook's crew will need something special to stand out and avoid being slated for following in its rival's footsteps instead of leading.\nOf course, the iPhone 17 Air could still be rumor and speculation, with screen protector makers reacting to the tips rather than any official design. But at this point, a form of iPhone 17 Air seems quite likely; we're sure to find out more come the expected September Apple event.\nYou might also like\nRoland Moore-Colyer is Managing Editor at TechRadar with a focus on phones and tablets, but a general interest in all things tech, especially those with a good story behind them.

      "text": "With the iPhone 16, Apple has taken its standard smartphone and elevated it to new heights. As you'll read in our iPhone 16 review, the addition of new buttons, new software, and a redesigned camera bump make Apple's latest base model a worthy upgrade over the already excellent iPhone 15.\nThe iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max rank among the best iPhones ever made, and they could get even better when Apple Intelligence features begin to roll out in earnest over the coming months. If well implemented, the iPhone 16 could become one of the best AI phones, too.\nBelow, we've rounded up everything you need to know about the iPhone 16, from its price and release date to its new hardware and software.\niPhone 16: key information\n- The iPhone 16 began shipping on September 20\n- Starts at $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399\n- It inherits the Action button from the iPhone 15 Pro\n- ... and gets a new dedicated Camera Control button\n- Camera Control can be used to instantly learn about your surroundings\n- The iPhone 16 uses the new A18 chipset\n- It comes with up to 512GB of storage\n- ... and 8GB of RAM to power Apple Intelligence\n- Apple Intelligence features will begin rolling out in October\n- ... but the Apple Intelligence public beta is live now\n- The iPhone 16's cameras are aligned vertically for spatial video capture\n- It ships with iOS 18\n- The iPhone 16 comes in Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White, and Black\n- The iPhone 16 charges at up to 45W, which is much faster than the iPhone 15\niPhone 16: price and release date\n- Starts at $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399\n- Began shiping on September 20\nThe iPhone 16 was announced at the 'It's Glowtime' Apple event on Monday, September 9, and began shipping on Friday, September 20. For a look at the latest deals, check our our dedicated iPhone 16 deals page.\nThe iPhone 16 starts at $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399 for the model with 128GB of storage, with that price rising to $899 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,599 for the model with 256GB of storage and $1,099 / \u00a31,099 / AU$1,949 for the model with 512GB of storage.\nFor reference, those are the same prices as we saw for the iPhone 15 at launch in the US and UK. In Australia, the iPhone 16 is actually AU$100 cheaper than the iPhone 15. Full iPhone 16 pricing can be found below.\n| Storage | US price | UK price | AU price |\n| 128GB | $799 | \u00a3799 | AU$1,399 |\n| 256GB | $899 | \u00a3899 | AU$1,599 |\n| 512GB | $1,099 | \u00a31,099 | AU$1,949 |\nIncidentally, the iPhone 16 is reportedly more popular than the iPhone 15 was at launch, even in regions where pricing has remained static.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\niPhone 16 specs\nBelow, we've detailed the key iPhone 16 specs.\n| iPhone 16 | |\n|---|---|\n| Dimensions: | 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm |\n| Weight: | 170g |\n| Display: | 6.1-inch OLED |\n| Resolution: | 2556 x 1179 pixels |\n| Refresh rate: | 60Hz |\n| Chipset: | A18 |\n| Rear cameras: | 48MP main (26 mm, \u0192/1.6), 12MP ultrawide (13 mm, \u0192/2.2) |\n| Front camera: | 12MP (\u0192/1.9) |\n| Storage: | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB |\niPhone 16 colors\nThe confirmed iPhone 16 colors are Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White, and Black.\nFor reference, the iPhone 15 launched in Yellow, Blue, Pink, Green, and Black, so Apple has swapped out three shades for new colors this year.\niPhone 16: new features\n- New Action Button\n- New Camera Control button\n- New A18 chipset\n- Will get Apple Intelligence features in October\n- Vertical cameras for spatial video capture\nSave for its vertically aligned rear camera lenses (which have been re-arranged to allow for spatial video capture) and the additions of both the iPhone 15 Pro's multi-purpose Action button and an all-new Camera Control button, the standard iPhone 16 looks a whole lot like the standard iPhone 15.\nOf course, those three physical upgrades are not inconsequential \u2013 they're most definitely all welcome, especially the new Camera Control feature, which we'll dive into below \u2013 but alone, they're not enough of a reason to upgrade. The real exciting improvements for the iPhone 16 come under the hood.\nFor starters, Apple's latest standard model is powered by the new A18 chipset, which marks a two-step jump over the A16 Bionic chipset inside the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. That's a big deal, since Apple almost always slaps its previous-generation top-end chipsets on its new standard models; instead, this year, the iPhone 16 gets an exclusive chipset (well, alongside the iPhone 16 Plus).\nThat said, an early benchmark suggests the A18 chipset might not quite provide as much of a boost in power as we'd hoped.\nIt will however boost your privacy, as we've learned that it includes a way to stop malicious apps from disabling the camera and microphone indicators.\nWe also now know that the iPhone 16 comes with 8GB of RAM, up from 6GB of RAM on the iPhone 15. Apple has confirmed as much, but the revelation came as no surprise, as at least 8GB of RAM is needed to power Apple Intelligence features, which we know the iPhone 16 has (albeit not until October, when Apple Intelligence will begin rolling out in beta).\nAmong the most exciting Apple Intelligence features on the horizon are a ChatGPT-powered Siri, text summarization, writing assistance, and generative image creation. These tools will bring the iPhone 16 in line with rival devices like the Google Pixel 9 and Samsung Galaxy S24 \u2013 in other words, Apple is no longer behind in the AI race.\nApple hasn't yet disclosed the size of the iPhone 16's battery, but we do know that the new phone offers a \"big boost in battery life.\" Given that the iPhone 15 is rated for 20 hours of video playback, that's a promising claim.\nThe iPhone 16 also supports wireless MagSafe charging at up to 25W, which is almost double the previous 15W limit, and 45W wired charging, which is over 50% faster than the iPhone 15 lineup. Nice work, Apple.\nBut back to the Camera Control button, which is the big new physical upgrade on all of the iPhone 16 models. This physical-but-also-capacitive button sits on the right-hand side of the phone, under the power button, and doubles as a shutter release.\nOne press of the Camera Control button immediately initiates the camera app, another press takes a photo, while holding it down starts a video. But that's not all: rather like a touch bar, the Camera Control button also supports various gesture controls, so can zoom and adjust exposure, among other useful things, using just your finger.\nAs mentioned, this new Camera Control button is joined by the old multi-purpose Action button on the iPhone 16, so presumably the combination of the two features could make the new phone (or at least the iPhone 16 Pro) one of the best camera phones around.\nMy analysis\nAxel is TechRadar's Phones Editor, and has been reviewing and writing about the best mobile devices (iPhones included) for several years. Based in the UK, he handles news and feature coverage for the phones section of the site, and regularly edits TechRadar's phones-related reviews and buying guides. You'll find Axel's byline on over 1,500 TechRadar articles.\nSo, should you upgrade to the iPhone 16? Well, the bottom line is this: the iPhone 16 is designed for those who want to access Apple Intelligence features without paying the premium demanded by the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max (or indeed last year's iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max).\nOn a design level, this is a very similar phone to the iPhone 15. It's the same size, it's got similar cameras, the same screen, and although Apple is promising \"big\" battery life upgrades for the iPhone 16, the iPhone 15's battery is already more than decent.\nThat said, there's more to the iPhone 16 than meets the eye. As TechRadar's Jacob Krol concluded in his iPhone 16 review: \"The line between standard iPhones and Pro models is getting increasingly blurred, as the base iPhone 16 is now a powerful pick that mixes affordability with a lot of newness.\n\"And the speed of Apple\u2019s A18 platform, combined with two excellent cameras and an entirely new Camera Control button, make the iPhone 16 a great choice for folks who don\u2019t need to go Pro.\"\nSo, that's all positive stuff. I am a little disappointed that Apple stuck with a 60Hz display, and that we'll need to wait for Apple Intelligence features to be rolled out after the iPhone 16 is shipped. But if you don't want to be left behind in the AI race, or are sporting an older iPhone, then the iPhone 16 is well worth picking up.\nIf you're not too fussed about virtual assistance, though, and are holding out for some more consequential iPhone design upgrades, then Apple's latest standard model doesn't look like a must-own if you're coming from an iPhone 15.\nAxel is TechRadar's Phones Editor, reporting on everything from the latest Apple developments to newest AI breakthroughs as part of the site's Mobile Computing vertical.

      "text": "The iPhone's Camera Control could be the new MacBook Touch Bar, according to sketchy rumor that says iPhone 18 will drop it\n- The iPhone 17 series could be the last phones with a Camera Control button\n- This is apparently because Apple has found that people aren't using it much\n- But the source doesn't have much of a track record, and there are other reasons to doubt this claim too\nIt\u2019s fair to say that responses to the Camera Control button on the iPhone 16 series have been mixed. While some users are unconvinced by this addition to the iPhone, others have found a lot to love about the Camera Control button. But if you\u2019re in the latter camp you\u2019ll be disappointed to hear that its days might be numbered.\nAccording to Weibo poster OvO Baby Sauce OvO (via GSMArena), the iPhone 17 series might be the last phones with this button, as Apple has apparently told its suppliers it will no longer order Camera Control button parts.\nThis is apparently because Apple has found that iPhone owners aren\u2019t using the button much, and that by removing this key, the company can cut some costs \u2013 which could be especially beneficial in this new age of tariffs.\nStill, I\u2019m unconvinced. It\u2019s hard to get a sense for how many people actually use the Camera Control button much, with social media suggesting it\u2019s a real mix of lovers and haters, but even if not many people are using it, we doubt Apple would give up on it so fast.\nEven the much-maligned MacBook Touch Bar lasted five years before Apple ditched it, and it\u2019s clear that some people do like the Camera Control.\nMore than just camera controls\nPlus, the Camera Control button does more than that name suggests \u2013 it\u2019s also the gateway to Visual Intelligence, which is one of Apple\u2019s headline AI features. Now, there are other ways to access this, but they\u2019re less immediate, or require you toggling it to the Action button, which then means you can\u2019t use that for something else.\nRight now, Visual Intelligence itself might not seem a big deal to most people, but that\u2019s in large part because Apple Intelligence lags behind rival AI services. If and when it starts to catch up, Visual Intelligence could be something you\u2019d reach for often, as it lets you use AI to learn about or translate whatever you\u2019re looking at.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nSo it seems unlikely that Apple would make such a major feature less easily accessible \u2013 it would be like admitting not only that these camera controls aren\u2019t that useful, but that Visual Intelligence isn\u2019t either.\nI can\u2019t see Apple doing that, and it\u2019s worth noting that the source making this claim also doesn\u2019t have much of a track record. So until the same claim is made by someone like Mark Gurman \u2013 who has a history of accurately leaking Apple information \u2013 you should probably file this under unlikely.\nYou might also like\n- The iPhone 17e could get these 3 upgrades, according to new leak \u2013 including the super-useful Dynamic Island\n- The iPhone 17 Air almost makes the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge look thick in new dummy unit photos\n- The iPhone 17 Pro could cost $50 more than its predecessor \u2013 here\u2019s what that might mean for other configurations\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "I\u2019m torn on the iPhones 16\u2019s Camera Control \u2013 it\u2019s handy but unfinished\nIf you\u2019ve read my previous thoughts on iPhones here at TechRadar and its sibling site Tom's Guide, you\u2019ll know I have fairly firm opinions on Apple\u2019s smartphones.\nSince moving from Android to iPhone at the end of 2021, I\u2019ve not gone back to the platform Google built, despite trying some of the best Android phones. The ease of iOS has taken in me; I love the titanium construction, I\u2019ve found Ceramic Shield glass to be a minor game changer, I enjoy the Action button, and the cameras almost never let me down on iPhones.\nBut for once, I\u2019m on the fence.\nWhat\u2019s got me pondering is the Camera Control \u2018button.\u2019 In some ways, it\u2019s a cool new feature that uses haptics well. In other ways, it\u2019s superfluous and not fully featured.\nI\u2019ve been trying out the iPhone 16 Pro Max for a couple of weeks now, and when it comes to capturing a photo, l try and use Camera Control as much as possible. As I\u2019m 37 and a millennial, I still like snapping photos on my phone in landscape orientation, so having a physical button where my finger naturally sits is good for capturing a shot without messing up the framing by tapping on the screen or trying to hit the Action button \u2013 I have this mapped to trigger the \u2018torch\u2019 anyway, which is surprisingly helpful.\nI also like flicking through zoom ranges with a swipe on the Camera Control without the need to tap on small icons. The exposure control is kind of cool, though swapping between the features Camera Control can control doesn\u2019t quite feel intuitive to me yet, and often, my taps cause me to lose the precise design of a scene.\nSo yes, Camera Control is interesting. But\u2026\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nDid anyone really ask for it? It feels like a feature for the sake of Apple\u2019s mobile execs to have something new to talk about at the September Apple event. It\u2019s just about a \u2018nice to have\u2019 feature, but it\u2019s hardly a phone photography game changer.\nNot my tempo\nHowever, maybe I\u2019ll warm to it over time. Yet, the biggest issue is the lack of AI tools at launch for Camera Control. Apple actively touts the AI features for Camera Control that can be used to smartly identify things the cameras are pointed at and serve up all manner of information. That hasn\u2019t happened yet, with a rollout arriving post-launch when Apple Intelligence fully arrives; there's a beta option, but I'm not willing to try that on my main phone.\nI\u2019ve yet to understand that. Sure, other phone makers have touted AI features that will come after their phones are released and may be limited to certain regions, to begin with, but at least they launch with some of the promised AI suites. The iPhone 16 range launched without any Apple Intelligence features.\nThis is not what I expected from Apple, a company that famously doesn\u2019t adopt new tech until it\u2019s refined and ready for polished prime time. So, for it to launch smartphones without next-generation smarts is baffling to me. But it\u2019s also the primary reason why I feel torn about Camera Control; if it had Google Lens-like abilities at launch, baked into a hardware format, I can see myself being a lot more positive about Camera Control.\nOf course, Apple's use of such a camera button will undoubtedly cause other phone makers to follow suit. I only hope they don\u2019t skimp on features when their phones launch.\nAs for Camera Control in the here and now, I\u2019ll keep an open mind and keep using it; I\u2019ll just cross my fingers that it'll become seriously handy once it gets its prescribed dose of AI smarts.\nYou might also like\nRoland Moore-Colyer is Managing Editor at TechRadar with a focus on phones and tablets, but a general interest in all things tech, especially those with a good story behind them.

      "text": "These rumored iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max features suggest Apple is planning its biggest camera upgrade for years\n- The top iPhone 17 models could get 8x optical zoom\n- An extra camera button could also be added\n- Apple is said to be working on a pro-level camera app\nIf Apple sticks to its usual schedule then we're less than two months away from the launch of the iPhone 17 models, and it sounds as though the Pro and Pro Max models are in line to get three key upgrades related to cameras and photography.\nAccording to an anonymous tipster who contacted MacRumors, the first upgrade is going to be a jump to 8x optical zoom, which would be up from the 5x optical zoom you can find in the iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nSecond, there's apparently going to be a second Camera Control button on the opposite side to the current Camera Control on the iPhone 16 models \u2013 which is on the right hand side of the handsets if you hold them in portrait mode.\nThe original Camera Control button lets you open the Camera app and tweak a variety of settings for taking pictures, including exposure and tone. Apparently the new button will \"complement\" the existing one with its own choice of settings.\nA new camera app?\nFinally, the third upgrade predicted by this tipster is a new \"pro camera app\" from Apple for photos and videos. It's not clear if this would be an iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max exclusive \u2013 it might be made available for other iPhones too.\nThe new app would take on the likes of Halide and Filmic Pro, available on the App Store. The tipster says that this app may arrive as an update to the Final Cut Camera app that Apple already makes, though presumably it would come preinstalled.\nWe don't really know anything about this tipster, so of course take these rumors with a grain of salt. The information is said to come from a commercial that's being filmed for Apple \u2013 and which will be used to show off this year's big new features.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIf all of this is accurate, it would be one of the most significant iPhone camera upgrades in quite some time, and 8K video might be included as well.

      "text": "If you give it a chance, there's a lot to love about the iPhone's Camera Control button\nIt\u2019s rare to see almost all Apple fans agree on something simultaneously, but when the Camera Control feature launched alongside the iPhone 16 line in September, hate for the additional button was swift and fierce (just take a look at some of the Reddit threads on the subject).\nAt the risk of angering the mob, I do not count myself among these Camera Control naysayers. In fact, Camera Control is one of my favorite features of my current iPhone, the iPhone 16 Plus.\nBefore I explain why I fall on that side of the debate, I will admit that Camera Control is far from perfect. I do agree that its positioning is a tad nonsensical, and it would work a great deal better if it were placed in a more natural spot, similar to a typical shutter button.\nStill, I know that I\u2019m not completely alone in my overall love for the photography-first button, with others on TechRadar having noted that it can be helpful at times, or even incredibly useful for a very specific purpose.\nSo, now that we\u2019re well over half a year into Camera Control's existence, and it looks set to remain part of the iPhone\u2019s toolkit for generations to come, I think it\u2019s worth taking another, closer look at the feature see what it does right, and how Apple might look to improve things on the iPhone 17.\nTaking iPhone\u2019s cameras to the next level\nI know I\u2019ll never be able to take a picture on my iPhone 16 Plus that could hold a candle to something taken on one of the best cameras, but the simplicity of smartphone photography is what wins over, time and time again.\nBeing able to quickly whip out your phone and take a snapshot never gets old, especially when those images are saved in the cloud for future reference or instantly available for sharing with friends on social media. Still, I'd be lying if I said that the physical experience of taking those shots feels superior on a phone.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIn my efforts to try and bridge that gap, I\u2019ve amassed a small collection of smartphone accessories over the years that try to recreate the traditional shutter button experience. I\u2019ve got the portable ShiftCam SnapGrip, as well as the company's more robust SnapGrip Pro attachment. But as with any accessory, these tools do diminish the compact nature of a smartphone, which is why the introduction of Camera Control felt like the answer to a problem I'd been trying to fix.\nNo longer would I need to carry these add-ons about my person; now I could just use the wonderfully clicky button that Apple had built into the body of its latest handsets.\nNot only that, but part of the reason why I enjoy using a physical shutter button, as opposed to just poking the touchscreen, is that the delayed resistance between the movement of my finger and the picture being taken forces me to be a bit more considerate in the shots I take.\nHolding the phone a bit more tightly in order to frame the shot and account for any movement when pressing Camera Control gives you a moment of pause to assess whether or not you\u2019re actually taking a picture of something that interests you, or you\u2019re simply doing so for the sake of it. With this in mind, Camera Control has helped me not only to take fewer pictures (and save my iPhone\u2019s storage in the process), but also feel happier with the shots that I do take.\nBecause of the way in which Camera Control lets you jump between the photographic styles on the iPhone 16, it\u2019s also allowed me to experiment a bit more with the types of pictures I take.\nFor example, an indoor shot that might look a tad mundane in color can actually look a great deal better when taken in black and white. Particularly, the Stark B&W mode is now my go-to option because of how it really saturates the monochrome palette to capture your attention.\nHow can Apple improve Camera Control?\nI firmly believe that Camera Control has had a solid first outing, but looking towards how it could be used in the iPhone 17 range, I think that there are some easy wins that Apple could claim to turn around the general consensus.\nAs I mentioned before, the positioning of Camera Control has to change. If Apple could just move the button closer to the bottom right-hand corner of the iPhone, it would make using the feature so much easier, although I concede that it might require tweaking the resistance to avoid accidental presses.\nWhat would really take Camera Control to the next level, however, is an app, or a set of built-in guides, that can teach folks who don\u2019t know that much about manual photography how to properly adjust aspects like depth and exposure.\nAs much as I loved having quick access to those components via Camera Control, I haven\u2019t felt confident enough to make use of them, which is why some help for beginners like myself would go a long way towards showing people how they can really maximize Camera Control to their own benefit.\nUntil such software comes to pass, you can always check out our list of the top five Camera Control tips you need to know, as well as our guide on how to customize Camera Control to better suit your needs.\nYou might also like\nAfter cutting his teeth covering the film and TV industries, Tom spent almost seven years testing the latest tech over at Trusted Reviews before heading out into the world of freelance writing.

      "text": "iPhone 17 Pro: latest rumors, tips and everything we\u2019ve heard so far\nThe iPhone 17 Pro probably won\u2019t land until September 2025, but this being a high-profile handset we\u2019re already hearing leaks and rumors about it \u2013 along with the rest of the iPhone 17 series.\nThe Pro will likely slot in just below the iPhone 17 Pro Max, and just above the iPhone 17 and perhaps the rumored iPhone 17 Air or iPhone 17 Slim.\nAnd while we don\u2019t know loads about it yet, early rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Pro will have a new button, new cameras, and a new chipset, making this a potentially major and exciting upgrade. Below, you\u2019ll find everything we\u2019ve heard about the iPhone 17 Pro so far.\nCut to the chase\n- What is it? The next smaller Pro iPhone\n- When is it out? Possibly September 9\n- How much will it cost? Likely upwards of $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,849\nExpect it in September\n- Likely to land in September of 2025\n- Will probably cost at least $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,849\nWe haven\u2019t heard many iPhone 17 Pro release date leaks yet, but based on Apple\u2019s usual patterns we can say that it will probably be announced in the first or second week of September, and indeed the first leak we heard points to a September launch for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nMore specifically, it will probably be announced on the Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday of the first or second week of September. Apple more often goes for the second week of September, leaving the most likely announcement dates as September 8, September 9, or September 10. These dates have now also been backed up by Apple watcher Mark Gurman, with another iPhone 17 Pro release date leak pointing to September 9 specifically.\nPre-orders then typically open on the Friday of the announcement week, which would mean September 12, and the iPhone 17 Pro will most likely ship the following Friday, which would be September 19, which is a date that has also been backed up by one of the leaks above.\nBut it\u2019s possible the various stages of the launch will happen a week earlier, or that Apple will break with its usual patterns.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThere aren\u2019t yet many iPhone 17 Pro price leaks either, but the iPhone 16 Pro starts at $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,849, and the earliest iPhone 17 Pro price leak we've heard suggests it might cost more than that. Given that President Trump is currently threatening Apple with tariffs, a price rise looks likely, and more recent iPhone 17 Pro price leaks agree, putting the increase at roughly $50 (around \u00a340 / AU$75).\nAnother leak has also put the iPhone 17 Pro Max at $50 higher than its predecessor, but added that it will also start at twice as much storage, with 256GB apparently being the base capacity. The same source has since reiterated this claim, suggesting they're confident of it.\nCan you trust these rumors?\nSo far there aren't many release date leaks or many price leaks, but based on past form we're almost certain that the iPhone 17 Pro will be announced in September, and from what we're hearing so far it could well have a price rise.\nA new button and a new color\n- Might include a new button and a new camera design\n- Expect the same screen size but possibly upgrades to the tech\n- Could have an aluminum frame\nThe biggest iPhone 17 Pro design leak we\u2019ve heard so far is that the volume buttons and the Action button might all be replaced by a single new key that can do the job of all those things. Exactly how it would do all those things is uncertain, but it may well have a similar design to the Camera Control button, meaning it can register different strength presses as well as swipes, and respond in different ways to each.\nIt's worth noting that Apple has previously made iPhone prototypes with unified volume buttons, including an iPhone 14 Pro prototype. The buttons here were solid-state rather than mechanical, and it's not clear whether the iPhone 17 Pro's implementation would be mechanical or not, if it even happens, but it could look something like this anyway.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro will probably also be available in at least one new shade, with one leak suggesting Apple is considering using one of the three colors pictured below. From left to right these are Dark Green Titanium, Teal Titanium, and Green Titanium, and the source says Teal Titanium is the most likely to get used.\nHowever, the same source has more recently said that a Sky Blue shade is the most likely, and has also previously put forward Titanium Blue or Titanium Purple as possibilities.\nMore recently, another iPhone 17 Pro colors leak pointed to orange, dark blue, black and white shades, while an even more recent iPhone 17 Pro colors claim suggested black, white, blue, gray, and brown shades.\nOrange is looking more likely than brown, as it has leaked more frequently, but it has also been met with a mixed reaction.\nIn any case, you might also be able to get a 'TechWoven' case for your iPhone 17 Pro, and these reportedly come in green, orange, black, navy blue, and purple shades.\nWe\u2019ve also heard that the iPhone 17 Pro might use a \u201cmore complex\u201d aluminum design, rather than the titanium of its predecessor.\nAnother leak has since shed more light on this aluminum design, saying that the iPhone 17 Pro will have an aluminum frame and that the top half of the back will also be aluminum, with the bottom half remaining glass so wireless charging will work. The report adds that it will also have a larger rectangular camera bump than the iPhone 16 Pro.\nA leaked image supposedly showing an iPhone 17 series frame lines up with this leak, and points to a Pixel 9-like camera design. You can see this below.\nHowever, we've elsewhere heard a counter to this, with another source saying the iPhone 17 Pro will use titanium, not aluminum.\nWe've also heard the possibility of a different but still new iPhone 17 Pro camera design, as you can see in the image below. But this comes from a source with a mixed track record, so we're not convinced.\nThis iPhone 17 Pro Max render got given a redo by its creator that paints the odd design in a new light. But it doesn't tell us any more about why Apple would go for such a design; Cupertino tends not to mix up iPhone design unless it facilitates a new feature or hardware.\nStill, ever more leaks are showing off this design, including a photo of what appears to be an iPhone 17 Pro test unit, multiple sets of iPhone 17 dummy units, and some that show an iPhone 17 Pro dummy unit alongside the iPhone 16 Pro, so it's looking likely, which is seemingly a disappointment to many Apple fans.\nIt's also a design that Google has poked fun at, for being somewhat similar to the Pixel line's appearance.\nThat said, more recent leaked iPhone 17 Pro dummy unit photos show a much more polished version of this design than those early leaks. So it might not look so bad after all.\nIn any case, there's also a small chance the iPhone 17 Pro could have a smaller Dynamic Island by hiding Face ID components under the screen. We've heard talk of a smaller Dynamic Island more than once now, but another source claims the Dynamic Island won't be changing.\nWe've also elsewhere heard that the iPhone 17 Pro won't have a two-tone design, with the camera and back apparently set to be the same color, and that from the front not much will be changing. You can see how this might look in a single-color iPhone 17 Pro render.\nOne smaller design change we might see is the presence of curvier sides than the iPhone 16 Pro has, though so far only one source has mentioned this.\nAnd while we don't yet know how thick the iPhone 17 Pro will be, it certainly looks a lot thicker than the iPhone 17 Air in a leaked image.\nAs for the screen, the iPhone 17 Pro might have a 6.3-inch display, just like the iPhone 16 Pro, but it could be more anti-reflective than the current display, as well as being more scratch resistant. That said, a more recent leak suggests Apple has abandoned plans for a scratch resistant and anti-reflective coating.\nWe've also heard that the iPhone 17 Pro's screen could use a new technology that makes it more power efficient, durable, and overall better performing.\nCan you trust these rumors?\nWe fully expect the iPhone 17 Pro to have a 6.3-inch screen, since Apple only recently upped the display size with the iPhone 16 Pro. Surprisingly, the new camera design is also looking likely, since lots of sources have said this is happening. The other design and display leaks so far are worth taking with a pinch of salt though, as not many sources have weighed in.\nTwo upgraded cameras\n- A 48MP telephoto upgrade is likely\n- It could also have a new 24MP front-facing camera\n- The main sensor could be smaller\nThe main camera upgrade coming to the iPhone 17 Pro could be a 48MP telephoto camera, up from 12MP on the iPhone 16 Pro. This 48MP telephoto camera has been mentioned in several iPhone 17 Pro camera leaks, including from reputable iPhone leakers, so this may well happen.\nMost leaks suggest it will still offer the same level of zoom \u2013 namely 5x optical zoom, but one source differs, saying that the iPhone 17 Pro will instead offer 3.5x zoom, but will still be capable of 'lossless' 5x and even 7x by cropping into the image.\nHowever, one questionable leak points to 8x optical zoom, along with a second Camera Control button and a new pro camera app.\nHowever, it's possible the biggest zoom upgrades will be limited to the iPhone 17 Pro Max, with one source saying this phone will be \"the most powerful telephoto phone\".\nThe other significant camera upgrade we could see is a 24MP front-facing camera, up from 12MP on the current model.\nAs for the main and ultra-wide cameras, leaks so far suggest they\u2019ll stick at 48MP like on the current model. However, one source suggests that oddly the main sensor could be smaller on the iPhone 17 Pro, which might make it a downgrade.\nWe've also heard that the iPhone 17 Pro might be capable of 8K video recording, which would be up from the 4K of current Pro models.\nAnd while less likely there\u2019s also talk that the iPhone 17 Pro could have a mechanical aperture, meaning you\u2019d be able to change the aperture and therefore also the depth of field.\nFinally, we've also heard that Apple might be testing a 200MP camera, but while this could be used on a future iPhone it probably won't be included on the iPhone 17 Pro.\nCan you trust these rumors?\nSo many sources have talked about a 48MP telephoto camera that this upgrade seems likely. We haven't heard as much about the other cameras though, including the rumored 24MP selfie snapper upgrade, so we're less sure of those specs. We also wouldn't count on the phone having a mechanical aperture, as that seems a bit niche for how much work it might involve.\nThe most powerful iPhone chipset yet\n- A top-end A19 Pro chipset\n- Either 8GB or 12GB of RAM\nOne thing we can be very confident about is that the iPhone 17 Pro will have a new chipset, one that will most likely be called the A19 Pro.\nNot only is an A19 Pro chipset an obvious upgrade, but it has also been mentioned by multiple sources.\nBeyond that, there\u2019s a chance that the iPhone 17 Pro will get 12GB of RAM, which is something we've heard more than once, and would be an increase on the 8GB in the iPhone 16 Pro.\nHowever while multiple leaks have pointed to 12GB, some others suggest that only the iPhone 17 Pro Max will get this upgrade.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro might however get a vapor chamber, which could help it avoid overheating and could also boost performance. We've heard this vapor chamber claim from multiple sources now, so it's looking likely.\nAnd as for the battery, Apple is reportedly considering using a thinner and lighter motherboard, which could free up additional space for a larger battery than in the current model. We've also heard that the iPhone 17 Pro could offer reverse wireless charging.\nFinally, for software we expect the iPhone 17 Pro to run iOS 26, and this is now out in beta form, so we know all about it. The headline change is a whole new look to the interface, but many apps have also been streamlined, a new Apple Games app has been added, and there are improvements to Apple Intelligence.\nCan you trust these rumors?\nOne of the few things we're almost certain of is that the iPhone 17 Pro will have a new chipset, since that's a standard yearly upgrade for Apple's phones. We hope it will also get a RAM upgrade, but so far it's unclear whether it will or not.\nYou might also like\n- Best iPhone: which Apple smartphone reigns supreme?\n- iPhone 16 Pro review: pocket-sized brilliance and no concessions\n- iPhone 17 Pro Max: latest news, rumors, and everything we\u2019ve heard so far\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "I found the absolute best use for the iPhone 16 Camera control \u2013 you just have to get a little wet\nCamera Control, one of the most significant updates to the iPhone 16 lineup, is a somewhat polarizing feature. Some are fascinated by the photographic possibilities, and others wonder why Apple thought we needed yet another button on the iPhone. I've been a bit torn myself. As Apple introduces new capabilities via iOS 18 updates, like a gentle press to lock focus and exposure, I excitedly test it out. Most of the time, however, I forget the button is there. That is, until I went on vacation and discovered Camera Control's true purpose.\nUnderwater photography.\nFor those not familiar with Camera Control, it's a button (Apple hates when we call it a button, but it moves, so it's a button) on the right side of all iPhone 16 models that responds to partial and complete presses and gestures to enable a wide range of camera features and, more recently, Apple's Visual Intelligence.\nCamera Control is a great feature, especially when you want to use, say, the iPhone 16 Pro Max in landscape mode. Holding it like a traditional camera, you press a physical, almost shutter-like button to snap a photo or launch a video capture.\nSurface dwellers need not apply\nAs I noted, I've used it some since the iPhone 16 launched in September 2024, but I often forget it's there. Fast forward to earlier this month and my long-awaited vacation to Antigua, a Caribbean island known for its excellent weather, beaches, palm trees, pristine water, and marine life.\nOne afternoon, we walked the long beach to a lagoon-like area where the water was particularly clear, calm, and shallow enough to wade in a few dozen yards without getting our chests and shoulders wet. Immediately, I noticed schools of small white fish swimming around my legs. Then I spotted others with stripes, a few long, thin ones, and at least a few darker swimmers.\nI tried using the iPhone 16 Pro Max to take pictures of the fish as they dashed around, but shooting from the surface into the water didn't produce any shareable results (see above). Having experimented with underwater iPhone photography in the past, I decided it was time to give my phone a dip. I didn't want to dive underwater, though. There was a strong breeze, and I thought it would be too cold. Instead, the plan was to just put the iPhone 16 under and snap away.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nA fin-tastic time\nAs I'm sure you know, your iPhone 16 is IP68 rated, which means it can be under 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. I felt confident the phone could handle a few intermittent dips and survive.\nI quickly realized this might be the perfect test bed for the new-ish Camera control button, so I gingerly lowered the phone into the water and started pointing it toward the fish. I didn't have to open the camera app beforehand. A full press of the button launches the Camera app.\nMoving slowly toward a pair of fish, I pressed the Camera Control just enough to enable exposure and focus lock (you feel a little haptic pulse), then I did a full press. I did this a few times, slowly chasing the fish from one side of the lagoon to the other.\nObviously, I could've still used the down volume button to shoot photos, but then I'd always have to start by opening the camera above water and then blindly fumbling to find the right button (\"Is it the \"up\" or \"down\" volume button?!\") while holding the phone underwater, which is no fun. Plus, you can't do the partial press to lock focus and exposure.\nLights, cameras, water, action\nI also used Camera Control to shoot some videos. Again, I like the idea that I didn't have to start shooting above water and then dip the phone in. Instead, I could find the shot I wanted and then press the button to start capturing the video. This may also have helped me get closer to the fish since they didn't see my big head right behind the iPhone.\nOne thing I could not do was apply gestures underwater in much the same way the iPhone's screen is useless when it's submerged.\nIn the end, I got some of the best underwater iPhone photos and videos I've ever captured, and while my hands and legs got wet, I never had to dive underwater. I think I prefer this to snorkeling.\nSwim safe\nOne important caveat on all this. If you follow my lead and start shooting underwater shots with your iPhone 16, remember that the time limit is 30 minutes and only at a depth of about 5 feet of water.\nMore importantly, once you've submerged your phone, you won't be able to charge it with a wired charger until that port is dried out. If you try to plug in a USB-C cable, the iPhone will launch an alarm and post an on-screen message. Just remember to travel with a wireless charger, and you'll be fine.\nIt can take a while for the phone to dry out after a dip. The morning after my excursion, I was working out and listening to a podcast on my iPhone through its speakers (no one else was there). The audio was quite muffled. I vigorously tapped the phone on my palm to dislodge the water that was likely blocking the speakers, and that did the trick.\nHave you been using Camera control on your iPhone 16?

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe line between standard iPhones and Pro models is getting increasingly blurred, as the base iPhone 16 is now a powerful pick that mixes affordability with a lot of newness. The range of available colors, including some strikingly vibrant options, make a great first impression, and the speed of Apple\u2019s A18 platform, combined with two excellent cameras and an entirely new Camera Control button, make the iPhone 16 a great choice for folks who don\u2019t need to go Pro.\nPros\n- +\nCamera control changes the game, and content creators will love it\n- +\nA18 chip is plenty powerful\n- +\nAction button is a welcome addition\nCons\n- -\nStill just a 60Hz display\n- -\nNot a major upgrade over the iPhone 15\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nApple iPhone 16: Two-Minute Review\nDo you need to go Pro? That\u2019s always been the question when new iPhones drop; and with the iPhone 16, it\u2019s never been more burning. Apple has narrowed the gap between standard and Pro with this year's lineup, and it really comes down to whether you want the telephoto camera and superior screen of the Pro iPhones, and whether you need even more horsepower.\nI\u2019ve spent a week with the iPhone 16, and it feels more Pro than I expected, starting with the A18 chip inside. Apple\u2019s putting an all-new chip \u2013 not a hand-me-down from last year\u2019s Pros \u2013 inside the iPhone 16. It makes everything about the iPhone 16 feel fast, from basics like email, browsing the web, or snapping photos to more advanced tasks like playing power-hungry games, editing photos or videos, and multitasking.\nFor the starting price, the iPhone 16 offers responsive performance to compete with rivals like the Galaxy S24 or Pixel 9. It\u2019s not a night-and-day improvement over the iPhone 15 for say, video exports or gaming, but if your iPhone is any older than that, you will notice an improvement day-to-day.\nThe 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display still lacks ProMotion and always-on features. Seemingly, Apple thinks you should go Pro to get those, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll miss them much. Just like the iPhone 15, the iPhone 16 boasts up to 2,000 nits of brightness for use on sunny outdoor days. It\u2019s also a great viewfinder for the 48-megapixel main camera, which has a better sensor than last year\u2019s iPhone, and an improved 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that can now shoot macro photography.\nThe cameras are similar to the iPhone 15's, but the real reason to upgrade would be for the new Camera Control button if you\u2019re into content creation. It\u2019s a major enhancement, and lets you easily capture photos or record videos while intuitively adjusting settings along the way \u2013 just be ready to have to practice the difference between a light and a heavy touch on the technology-filled button \u2026 err, control.\niOS 18 brings with it some fun new tricks, and a preview of Apple Intelligence shows that Apple isn\u2019t yet shipping some of the most exciting promised features \u2013 and we don\u2019t know when those will arrive \u2013 but the few that we\u2019ve been able to test work nicely on the iPhone 16.\nIf you currently have an iPhone 15 and aren\u2019t interested in Camera Control or Apple Intelligence, I\u2019d say you can hold out this year. But if you have an older iPhone, you get the sum of the iPhone 16\u2019s parts and the other enhancements that came before it, and that makes for a worthwhile upgrade.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nApple iPhone 16: Price and Availability\nApple\u2019s entire lineup of new iPhone\u2019s \u2013 the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max \u2013 are all up for preorder now and will officially land on September 20, 2024. That\u2019s also when deliveries will first arrive and from that day on they will be on sale at Apple stores.\nThe iPhone 16 comes in Pink, Ultramarine, Teal, Black, or White. Its storage capacity starts at 128GB, but you can get up to 256GB or 512GB. In the box, you\u2019ll get a white-braided USB-C to USB-C cable.\nRegardless of color, the iPhone 16 costs $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399 for 128GB of storage, $899 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,599 for 256GB of storage, and $1,099 / \u00a31,099 / AU$1,949 for 512GB of storage.\nApple iPhone 16: Specs\n| iPhone 16 | |\n|---|---|\n| Dimensions: | 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm |\n| Weight: | 170g |\n| Display: | 6.1-inch OLED |\n| Resolution: | 2556 x 1179 pixels |\n| Refresh rate: | 60Hz |\n| Chipset: | A18 |\n| Rear cameras: | 48MP main (26 mm, f/1.6), 12MP ultra-wide (13 mm, f/2.2) |\n| Front camera: | 12MP (f/1.9) |\n| Storage: | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB |\nApple iPhone 16: Design\n- Color choices for the iPhone 16 might be the best of any iPhone\n- Still feels like a modern iPhone, now with a redesigned camera stack\n- Much lighter than the iPhone 16 Pro\nFor most folks, you know an iPhone when you see one, and it\u2019s an aesthetic that is instantly recognizable as Apple keeps honing. I\u2019ve spent a week with the latest iPhone and it feels just like the iPhone 15 \u2013 it\u2019s actually the same dimensions at 146.7 x 71.6 x 7.8mm, which also comes close to the measurements of the iPhone 14.\nThat\u2019s not a bad thing. The iPhone 16 keeps the more modern build that the iPhone 15 ushered in with smooth, rounded edges and color-infused backs. However, rather than only offering light, pastel-y shades, Apple upped the vibrancy and delivered the best color lineup in ages.\nI\u2019ve got the Pink iPhone 16, and it\u2019s a delight \u2013 it\u2019s not quite hot pink like Barbie might choose, but it\u2019s still a bouncy shade that pops a bit differently depending on how the light hits it. You can also get it in Teal, Black, White, or Ultramarine \u2013- a mix of blues \u2013 and you can see the other colors in my iPhone 16 Plus review.\nAlong with the fresh colors, the back is home to the biggest design change. This is the only way that most folks will be able to tell the iPhone 16 from a previous one. The camera modules sit in a vertical orientation. The primary 48-megapixel Fusion camera sits atop the 12-megapixel ultrawide lens, stacked in a slightly raised glass bump that looks like a pill. The true tone flash is off to the side, but since Apple is sticking with larger lenses here, it\u2019s like the iPhone X\u2019s camera bump on steroids. I quite like this look.\nIt\u2019s not just for looks, though; this new orientation allows the iPhone 16 to capture Spatial Photos or Spatial Video for playback on the Apple Vision Pro. The stacked layout lets it capture proper stereo depth when shooting.\nThere are two new buttons on the iPhone 16 this year: the Action Button that premiered on the iPhone 15 Pro has officially trickled down. It\u2019s kind of a superhero, do-it-all button. You can pick from several presets to have it turn on the flashlight, start an accessibility feature, Shazam a song, or even open the camera \u2026 though I suspect that won\u2019t get much use.\nMore interestingly, you can set it up to run a Shortcut, which means it can really do anything. Using the Shortcut app on iOS, you can set up the ultimate smart home routine or have it start a group chain. Or you might be like me and have it play a specific version of Bruce Springsteen's \u201cBorn to Run.\u201d While it is more advanced, I appreciate that the app contains a bunch of pre-made options \u2013 it lowers the difficulty level.\nThe Action Button lives right above the volume up and volume down buttons on the left-hand side of the iPhone 16, and I think it\u2019s an excellent addition. You can also set it to just replace the mute switch, which is handy as that\u2019s the spot where the switch used to be.\nThe power button remains unchanged on the left-hand side, but towards the bottom is the \u201cCamera Control.\u201d While I\u2019m tempted to call it a button, it is, in fact, much more than that with a ton of tech stacked on top, including haptics to help you feel a light press, a double press, a slide to left or right, and even a deeper press. It\u2019s arriving on the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, as well as the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max.\nThe Camera Control is in the perfect spot, as it mirrors the shutter button on a traditional camera. When the iPhone 16 screen is off \u2013 I\u2019m still sad it\u2019s not always on \u2013 you can press Camera Control once wake up the phone and a second time to open the Camera.\nYou can Camera Control to take a shot or double-press lightly to pull up settings. Then, if you select zoom, you can swipe left or right to zoom in or out. I\u2019ll dive into this a bit more below, but it\u2019s quite possibly the best addition to arrive on the iPhone, and I think Apple recognizes just how many photos are taken with its phone every day, week, month, and year.\nBetween the new inputs, camera module redesign, and new colors, the iPhone 16 feels like a breath of fresh air for the modern iPhone. It\u2019s not a whole new look, but it\u2019s more than just one iterative change.\n- Design score: 4.5 / 5\nApple iPhone 16: Display\n- Gets bright enough to combat a sunny day or stark indoor lighting\n- Still no 120Hz ProMotion or Always-On functionality\n- Dynamic Island is even more useful with more apps offering Live Activities\nThe iPhone 16 has the same display as the iPhone 15, and that\u2019s not necessarily bad. It\u2019s still a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display that offers punchy, vibrant colors, stark contrast points, and inky blacks for reading text. While you may never need it, the display can also hit 2,000 nits at peak brightness, which means it can get really bright \u2013 like bright enough to be used on a sunny day on the beach or under harsh fluorescent lights. The iPhone 16 has a familiar resolution of 2556 x 1179 at 460 pixels per inch, just like the iPhone 15.\nFor taking and viewing photos, playing games, watching TikToks, browsing the web, and streaming Emily in Paris, everything looked great on the iPhone 16\u2019s screen. I regularly drive an iPhone 15 Pro Max, which boasts an always-on display and ProMotion (aka a 120Hz refresh rate). The iPhone 16 is not only easier to hold in just one hand than supersized iPhones like the iPhone 16 Plus, but it\u2019s enjoyable to use daily.\nThe iPhone 16 also sticks with a pill-shaped notch called the Dynamic Island, and I\u2019m a huge fan of the versatility here. iOS has visual feedback called Live Activities that can live on top of the Dynamic Island, so you can quickly dismiss a timer after watching it count down at the top, or get music playback controls complete with colors that match the album artwork and waveform of the audio.\nThird-party applications like Flighty can take over the Dynamic Island to show you how much time is left before you land or, on the ground, until you start boarding. It\u2019s super functional and contains the Face ID sensors for securely unlocking and authenticating your phone. The 12-megapixel front-facing camera is also on the Dynamic Island for selfies, video calls, or recording your next trending TikTok.\nLike the iPhone 15, the Super Retina XDR display is not always on and does not support ProMotion, Apple\u2019s name for a 120Hz screen. I don\u2019t think either of these will really be a bother unless you\u2019re coming from a device that had those features. I\u2019ve used 120Hz screens, but I didn\u2019t notice the iPhone 16 slowing down with scrolling, video playback, or gaming. It feels quite responsive and, again, I really did enjoy the viewing experience here.\nConsidering that Apple has promoted always-on and ProMotion to the Pros, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see them arrive for some time. Yes, other phones in this price range offer 120Hz refresh on the display and always-on features with LTPO technology, but unless you\u2019ve used them before, you won\u2019t miss them. You might miss them out of spite, but not in use.\n- Display score: 4 / 5\nApple iPhone 16: Software and Apple Intelligence\n- iOS 18 lets you customize even more of the iPhone experience\n- Passwords app is a great addition\n- Apple Intelligence is arriving soon with some useful features\nI\u2019m happy that iPhone 16 is powered by the A18 processor and not last year\u2019s A17 Pro as iOS 18 has a whole lot of features and Apple Intelligence is right around the corner with iOS 18.1 (expected to arrive next month, October 2024).\niOS 18 doesn\u2019t redesign the iPhone\u2019s operating system, but it adds a lot of good stuff. For one, the app grid is now flexible, and you can place app icons with spaces between them or even use empty rows. You can also apply a color tone to all your apps, and for the dark mode lovers out there, you can set apps to always appear in that shade.\nThe Passwords app is a really welcome addition as it moves your saved logins out of Settings and into a dedicated space. You can save any and all accounts \u2013 previous passwords stored within the iCloud keychain will appear here \u2013 as well as Wi-Fi credentials, and you can share with friends or family. It\u2019s an iOS sleeper hit.\nFinally, RCS messaging support is here, which makes it easier to text with friends who don\u2019t have an iPhone. You can now schedule iMessages to be sent in the future, a feature I especially like. If you know you need to send a message, you no longer need to make a note and then remember to send it later.\nThese are just a few of the things that iOS 18 enables, but I encourage you to check out TechRadar\u2019s other pieces here. It\u2019s modern software that matches the hardware.\nOf course, we also have Apple Intelligence, and it\u2019s coming in hot. It was a key focus when Apple unveiled the iPhone 16 as the first iPhone built from the ground up for Apple Intelligence.\nI\u2019ve been able to play with some of the forthcoming features \u2013 like Writing Tools, Clean Up in Photos, and Summarization \u2013 within the developer beta of iOS 18.1. I\u2019m not speaking to performance here, as bugs and slowdowns are expected with any beta, but let me peel back the curtain a bit and talk about what you can expect.\nFor one, I\u2019ve tried the redesigned Siri and I love the colorful screen takeover effect. Gone is the floating orb at the bottom, and now a rainbow-hued edge wraps around the iPhone 16's 6.1-inch display. It\u2019ll continue glowing while listening and responding, and while it isn\u2019t fully context-aware of what\u2019s on your screen, Apple\u2019s assistant is better at understanding the nuances of conversation. You can also double-tap at the bottom should you want to type to Siri.\nMy favorite Apple Intelligence experience is the notification summaries. If you\u2019re in a big group chat with college friends and you constantly get pings, Apple Intelligence will summarize and group them together. The summaries are sometimes comically inaccurate, but more times than not it\u2019s been quite helpful. The best part is that Apple Intelligence is not just for messages; it will try to summarize all notifications.\nI really wish that Apple\u2019s \u201cWriting Tools\u201d were more front-and-center. To find Writing Tools, when you draft a message you need to select all the text, then click the Apple Intelligence icon if it shows up at the top of the keyboard. It\u2019s buried a bit, and the results vary.\nThe most fun elements of Apple Intelligence, like Image Playground, Genmoji, context-aware Siri, and countless others, are not here yet. Neither is Visual Intelligence, which is essentially Apple\u2019s take on Google Lens, though a bit more actionable. It is still forthcoming.\nThus far, the limited Apple Intelligence features available on the iPhone 16 run very well on this phone. Clean Up can finish removing someone from the background of a photo faster on my iPhone 16 than on my iPhone 15 Pro Max, so I think the iPhone 16\u2019s A18 processor will be plenty powerful for the eventual tidal wave of Apple Intelligence features.\n- Software score: 4 / 5\nApple iPhone 16: Camera\n- Still a two camera setup\n- Changes to image processing deliver an improvement in clarity and low-light performance\n- Camera Control is an excellent addition, which avid photographers will love\nWith the iPhone 16 family, Apple\u2019s been focusing on leveling the playing field and closing the gap between non-Pros and Pros. That trend clear with the cameras and heralded by Camera Control launching on all the iPhone 16 models.\nOf course, what\u2019s a camera control without cameras to capture content? For the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, Apple is sticking with two cameras: a 48-megapixel Fusion and a 12-megapixel ultrawide. Both are similar to the main and ultrawide on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, but are aided in performance by the new image pipeline on the A18 chip.\nTechnically, you can shoot from 0.5x ultrawide all the way up to a 2x telephoto, or go all the way to 10x digital zoom. It\u2019s not as versatile as the iPhone 16 Pro or Pro Max, considering those both have real optical zoom, but the camera is no slouch here. Whether I used it to capture cityscapes, portraits of humans and dogs, or mixed lighting at a concert, the iPhone 16 was up for the challenge.\nI particularly like the clarity and level of detail that the iPhone 16\u2019s main camera provides\u2014the \u201cFusion\u201d nomenclature is twofold, as it combines every four pixels into one, delivering 48-megapixel quality in a 24-megapixel default-size image.\nYou can shoot with 48-megapixels, but if you pick the 128GB storage option, you may want to reserve that for special shots. The 24-megapixel shots, which you can see below, are rich with details and especially good at providing a natural bokeh around an object.\nI also appreciate that the iPhone 16 is a bit better than the iPhone 15 and much better than the previous models at handling light flares at night, thanks to a new anti-reflective coating. You can also get closer without physically moving as there is 2x telephoto option, which basically zooms in using the 48-megapixel full-size sensor. It\u2019s a nice way to frame portraits or focus attention.\nThe 12-megapixel ultrawide is still a unique way to frame shots and capture a good amount of detail without crazily obscuring the corners or edges. It boasts a faster f/2.2 aperture vs. last year\u2019s f/2.4 ultrawide, and allows more light to be captured, making it better for nighttime shooting.\nI especially like that Macro photography is now on the base model iPhone 16 and 16 Plus. It\u2019s a very fun shooting mode, and I got closer to nature and discovered hidden elements in objects. I also appreciate that you can turn this on by default or manually enable it.\nAll-in-all, the iPhone 16 is a powerful camera, and it\u2019s made better by the Camera Control. It took me a few days to get used to the new control, these learning how much pressure to apply and figuring out that there are hidden menus. I\u2019ve gotten used to it and like that it\u2019s in a natural position that lets me snap a shot with ease.\nWhen taking photos, you can perform two light presses to see more advanced options, including exposure, depth, zoom, camera, styles, and tone. You can click into any of these and then adjust by swiping through presets to make adjustments. When you engage the Camera Control, the interface gets much cleaner, leaving just the digital shutter button.\nFolks who love taking photos or recording videos will be right at home with Camera Control. Give it a few days, but it can be a great tool when you learn the various sub-menus for capturing a shot and making minute adjustments.\nI enjoyed using it at the Sea Hear Now Festival to quickly zoom in on the stage or swipe back to get an ultra-wide to capture the crowd. Even better, I jumped into styles to get a cool shot in black and white. I unpack this more in my iPhone 16 Plus review, but the Camera Control is an excellent addition that highlights how impactful the iPhone can be for capturing photos and videos and memories.\nApple isn\u2019t the first and won\u2019t be the last to add a super-charged shutter button to a phone. But it\u2019s a very Apple approach to layer Camera Control with technology like a force sensor and taptic engine with a touch surface and a sapphire crystal finish. It feels super high-end, even on the affordable iPhone 16, and I could see a lot of folks upgrading just for more minute control over the camera.\nIf you\u2019re getting a case, it pays to get one that isn\u2019t simply a cutout but has the proper tech embedded to match the sapphire crystal \u2013 I like Apple's own Silicon solution, the Otterbox Lumen or the new Beats by Dre iPhone cases.\niPhone 16 camera samples\n- Camera score: 4.5 / 5\nApple iPhone 16: Performance\n- The A18 provides the iPhone 16 with plenty of power, likely for years to come\n- Improved GPU makes intense games and intense creative use cases fly here\n- The iPhone 16 is ready for future Apple Intelligence features\nConsidering that the standard iPhones have received the last year\u2019s processor for the last few years, it\u2019s good news and a welcome surprise that the iPhone 16 is getting a brand-new platform. The Apple-made A18 powers the smaller 6.1-inch iPhone 16 and the bigger 6.5-inch iPhone 16 Plus. And if you were impressed by the forthcoming Apple Intelligence features, know that the A18 has a sizable Neural Engine to help power all your AI processes\u2026 well, at least the ones that stay on the device.\nMaking up the A18 is a 6-core CPU comprised of 4 efficiency cores and 2 performance cores, a 5-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. That\u2019s all paired with 8GB of RAM, to help with everyday tasks, more creative ones, gaming, and even Apple Intelligence tools like Clean-Up in Photos or Writing Tools.\nThis all comes together for a fast experience whether I tried those basic tasks that I expect an iPhone to hit out of the park or more advanced chores like exporting a 4K video in CapCut, playing a AAA title like Resident Evil, or remixing audio in the Photos app.\nWhether browsing the web, picking songs in Nugs.net or Apple Music, streaming the latest episode of Futurama on Disney+, drafting this review, or opening any number of apps, I couldn\u2019t make the iPhone 16 slow down. Not even when I tossed a FaceTime on top. The phone did get hot during some AAA gaming, but it did not get slower.\nFor games, whether Assassin's Creed or Asphalt 9, the improved GPU of the A18 made the experience even more immersive with smooth gameplay and the ability to see extra details. I\u2019ll be curious to see future titles take advantage of this extra horsepower, and it could make the argument even stronger for gaming within the Apple ecosystem. Of course, you won\u2019t get a 120Hz refresh rate on this phone.\nI\u2019ve been impressed with performance day in and day out for over a week on the iPhone 16 \u2013 it feels efficient, smooth, and has the proper amount of speed for the cost. From a quantitative perspective, the iPhone 16 scored a 3,301 on Geekbench 6 single-core and 8,033 on multicore, which beats the current Android champs, like the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.\nSafe to say, the A18 is plenty powerful, and I suspect it will offer plenty of headroom for years. It also puts the standard iPhones closer to the Pros than ever \u2013 and that\u2019s before you throw in Camera Control, great colors, and Apple Intelligence.\n- Performance score: 4.5 / 5\nApple iPhone 16: Battery\n- Like the iPhone 15, the iPhone 16 delivers all-day battery life\n- Support for faster wired and wireless charging is a welcome addition\nJust like with iPhone 15, and every iPhone before that, Apple does not publicly share the battery size for any of its phones \u2013 or most of its products. We\u2019ll wait until somebody else tears one apart to get the answer in mAh. Rather, Apple says the iPhone 16 should last for up to 22 hours of local video playback, up to 18 hours of video playback if streamed, and up to 80 hours of audio playback. That\u2019s an additional 2 hours of video playback over the iPhone 15.\nConsidering those are specific use cases, I\u2019m here to tell you that the iPhone 16 can get you through a full day, from morning to evening, even under more intensive use. After a few days of use I\u2019d estimate 15 to 16 hours of screen time before I needed to recharge my iPhone 16.\nYou can, of course, engage low power mode to stretch it a bit more and stop it from constantly refreshing in the background. On Future Lab\u2019s battery rundown test, the iPhone 16 lasted for 12 hours and 43 minutes, which is a decent amount of time, but not the best I\u2019ve seen.\nOn a particularly busy day at a festival filled with a lot of photo capture and video recording, I did need to recharge my iPhone 16 after about 8 hours of use. So, more intense tasks will eat the battery faster. Luckily, it still comes with a braided USB-C to USB-C cable in the box, and you can fast-charge the iPhone 16. I was able to get it from 0% to 48% in about 30 minutes with a standard 20-watt adapter, but plugging it into a 35-watt charger did get to 51% in 30 minutes.\nThe iPhone 16 also has some new wireless charging tech with support for the new MagSafe charger and the Qi2 standard \u2013 you can get up to 25W with MagSafe and up to 15W with Qi2. You\u2019ll also want to pair either of those with at least a 30-watt adapter. I did notice with either wireless charging platform, the iPhone 16 did get a bit warmer than with a wired charge.\n- Battery score: 4 / 5\nApple iPhone 16: Should You Buy?\niPhone 16 score card\n| Attributes | Notes | Rating |\n| Design | Not only does the iPhone 16 feel great in the hand with extra ergonomics, the camera layout looks the part, and the color palette is terrific. | 4.5 / 5 |\n| Display | While it\u2019s not ProMotion or Always-on, the iPhone 16 still offers a vibrant screen that is great for myriad tasks indoors or outdoors. | 4 / 5 |\n| Performance | With the new A18 inside, the iPhone 16 feels like it can keep up with the Pros. | 4.5 / 5 |\n| Camera | The new Camera Control steals the attention and lets you get more out of an excellent main camera and a good ultrawide shot that allows for unique framing. | 4.5 / 5 |\n| Software | iOS 18 provides many small updates, and once Apple Intelligence is here, it will be supported. | 4 / 5 |\n| Battery | You can expect around a day of use from the iPhone 16, but it won\u2019t stretch to two. | 4 / 5 |\n| Value | The standard 16 feels more like a Pro, and even with only 128GB of storage, it\u2019s good value. | 4 / 5 |\nBuy it if..\nYou want an affordable, smaller iPhone\nAt $799 and with a 6.1-inch display, the iPhone 16 is an excellent option for those who don\u2019t want to use two hands or spend a ton.

To complete this review, I've been using the iPhone 16 in Pink for over a week as my daily driver. I transferred my phone number via e-sim from my iPhone 15 Pro Max and began to set up the iPhone 16 as new.\nDuring my time with it, I tried to test out every facet of the phone, from making calls to playing games, productivity tasks, taking tons of photos and videos, FaceTime calls, and much more. To test performance, I performed both qualitative and quantitative tests, including GeekBench 6. For battery life, I marked how the percentage dropped over the day and what type of tasks I was completing. The team at Future Labs US conducted a battery test.\nFor the camera, I took many photos and videos utilizing all the different modes, including 0.5x, 1x, 2x, Portrait, Macro, and Panorama. I also took comparison photos with an iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPhone 15, and iPhone 15 Plus. For video, I filmed using all the available recording options and tested the new editing features, including audio mix and slowing down 4K recordings.\nI compared daily usage results with other phones, both iPhone and Android and tried to ultimately use them as I would use my phone daily. With iOS 18.1 and trying out Apple Intelligence, I focused on the features currently available and how they performed.\nFirst reviewed September 2024.\nJacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

      "text": "The iPhone 17 Air almost makes the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge look thick in new dummy unit photos\n- New photos show an iPhone 17 Air dummy unit alongside the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge\n- Apple's phone looks quite a lot slimmer than Samsung's\n- However, its camera appears to stick out further\nIt looks like we\u2019re going to see a battle of the super slim smartphones this year, as not long ago, the 5.8mm thick Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge launched, and we\u2019re expecting the iPhone 17 Air to follow very soon \u2013 a phone that could be even slimmer.\nTipsters haven\u2019t yet settled on exactly how thick Apple\u2019s upcoming phone will be, with various sources putting it at between 5.0mm and 6.0mm. But the bulk of recent leaks position it somewhere in the middle of those figures, with 5.44mm, 5.5mm, and 5.65mm having been put forward by separate sources.\nIf the iPhone 17 Air does come in at any one of those rumored thicknesses, it will be slimmer than the Galaxy S25 Edge, and while a difference of roughly 0.15mm \u2013 0.35mm might not sound like much, a leaked photo suggests the difference in thickness between these two phones could be really noticeable.\nBe honest, S25 Edge or iPhone 17 Air? \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/F81O7Q1WeIAugust 17, 2025\nShared by @theonecid, the photos above show a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge alongside what\u2019s presumably an iPhone 17 Air dummy unit, and you can see that the latter looks much slimmer.\nHaving said that, it also looks like the iPhone 17 Air\u2019s camera lens might stick a bit further out than Samsung\u2019s, so at the widest point, it might not be much slimmer. Still, for the most par,t the iPhone 17 Air looks impressively thin here.\nComing with compromises\nOf course, there are inevitably compromises in having such a slim phone, with the biggest rumored one being just one camera lens on the back. The Galaxy S25 Edge has two, and the standard iPhone 17 is expected to have two as well.\nBeyond that, it\u2019s also likely that the iPhone 17 Air will have a small battery, so you might have to sacrifice quite a lot if you choose Apple\u2019s slimmest phone.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nBut options are good. If you want something slightly thicker, there\u2019s the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, and if you don\u2019t care about slim phones at all, then there are all sorts of other devices to choose from \u2013 including the rest of the iPhone 17 line, all of which we\u2019re expecting to launch in early September.\nYou might also like\n- The iPhone 17 Pro could cost $50 more than its predecessor \u2013 here\u2019s what that might mean for other configurations\n- iPhone 17 Air leak reveals what it might lack compared to the iPhone 17 Pro \u2013 and I think that's too big a compromise\n- 'This looks hideous': the iPhone 17 Pro has been shown off in a new orange shade that you\u2019re going to either love or hate\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "The best iPhone for you will depend on what you value most in a smartphone. We've reviewed every iPhone released since 2007 (that's 46 models and counting), so we can confidently say that you don't necessarily need to buy the most expensive model to get the best experience with Apple's ubiquitous smartphones.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is, of course, the obvious choice for power users, but the standard iPhone 16 is a better option for those who prefer smaller phones. The iPhone 15, meanwhile, continues to rank as the best-value iPhone, while the newly announced iPhone 16e is the outright cheapest model.\nThe iPhone 17 series is tipped to land on September 9, so if you're in the market for a new iPhone, we'd suggest waiting until next month (if you can) before making a decision on which model to buy. Even if you're not fussed about owning the latest iPhone, the new line's arrival will likely drive the price of existing models down.\nBelow, we've selected the best iPhones for every use case, comparing key factors such as price, performance, cameras, and battery life to help you find a model that meets your needs. We've tested over 1,000 phones since 2005, so you can be confident that our recommendations are based on expert knowledge, in-depth analysis, and intelligent comparisons between devices.\nOnce you're set on a model, check out our best iPhone deals and Apple coupon codes pages for a roundup of the latest discounts. And for a look into the future, head to our iPhone 17 rumors hub.\nQuick list\nBest overall\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is the best Apple phone you can buy today. Its combination of an A18 Pro chipset, a great camera suite, and Apple Intelligence compatibility make it a potent flagship handset, though the smaller iPhone 16 Pro is equally impressive.\nRead more below\nBest for most people\nAll things considered, the iPhone 16 is the best all-round iPhone on the market right now thanks to its compact size, A18 chipset, excellent cameras, and future-proof software compatibility.\nRead more below\nBest value\nApple's base 2023 model may lack the bells and whistles of its newer stablemates, but the iPhone 15 is still fast, compact, and photographer-friendly. With USB-C connectivity and the Dynamic Island, it's a very complete iPhone for a compelling price.\nRead more below\nBest budget\nIf you're happy to forgo some niceties like the Dynamic Island and MagSafe, the iPhone 16e is an excellent iPhone entry-point thanks to its top-tier screen and powerful performance.\nRead more below\nBest battery life\nThe iPhone 16 Plus is the model to go for if battery life is your number one priority. The 16 Pro Max offers comparable endurance, but as a value proposition, the 16 Plus has it beat.\nRead more below\nI'm TechRadar's Phones Editor, and have been reviewing and writing about the best mobile devices (iPhones included) for several years. Based in the UK, I handle news and feature coverage for the phones section of the site, and regularly edit TechRadar's phones-related reviews and buying guides. You'll find my byline on over 1,500 TechRadar articles.\nThe best iPhone in 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best iPhone overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you want the very best iPhone money can buy right now, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is the model to go for. The iPhone 15 Pro Max was already (and still is) an exceptional handset, but Apple's latest flagship comes with a bigger screen, a more powerful chipset, a superior telephoto camera, a new Camera Control button, and Apple Intelligence compatibility.\nApple is pitching the latter of those features as the biggest selling point of the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and while Apple Intelligence endured a rocky start to life, it's beginning to take shape, with more Apple Intelligence features on the way, too.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is powered by the A18 Pro chipset, which, according to our benchmark tests, is the most powerful chipset Apple has ever produced. In fact, the A18 Pro bested the results of all of the Android phone chipsets we tested in 2024, so the 16 Pro Max is a truly market-leading handset.\nAll that power makes scrolling, streaming, gaming, and productivity tasks a breeze on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, while the phone's gorgeous 6.8-inch Super XDR OLED display (with ProMotion) is the biggest and best iPhone screen, well, ever.\nOn the camera front, the iPhone 16 Pro Max boasts a 48MP quad-pixel main lens, a 48MP ultra-wide lens (the first on an iPhone), and a 12MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom (even more zoom would've been nice, but perhaps that's being greedy). Apple's new flagship also achieved a record-setting 16 hours of battery life in our testing, which is a figure rivaled only by the iPhone 16 Plus.\nIt's worth noting that the 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro is exactly the same phone as the iPhone 16 Pro Max, but smaller and cheaper. So, if you're not fussed about owning the biggest iPhone, we'd advise going for that model instead.\nRead our full iPhone 16 Pro Max review\nThe best iPhone for most people\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're not fussed about the larger size, faster refresh rate, and telephoto camera capabilities of Apple's more expensive Pro models, the standard iPhone 16 is an excellent all-round iPhone that we consider to be the best iPhone for most people.\nThe iPhone 15 (below) is still our pick as the best-value iPhone given its cheaper price, but the iPhone 16's compatibility with Apple Intelligence means that it won't become outmoded as quickly as Apple's 2023 base model.\nOf course, the iPhone 16 brings more than just software upgrades. In addition to the Action button inherited from the iPhone 15 Pro, the iPhone 16 gets an all-new Camera Control button, which can be used as a traditional shutter button or as a capacitive button that lets you zoom and adjust exposure, as well as a superfast A18 chipset, a larger battery and a faster 45W charging speed than the iPhone 15.\nThe iPhone 16's 48MP wide and 12MP ultra-wide cameras are impressive, but if you want truly exceptional zoom capabilities, you're better off going for the iPhone 16 Pro (or indeed the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra or Pixel 9 Pro).\nAs for the iPhone 16's display, you'll get a stunning 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED screen that we found offers punchy colors and stark contrast points, though as alluded to above, you'll have to go for the pricier iPhone 16 Pro to benefit from Apple's ProMotion (i.e. 120Hz refresh rate) technology. For a spec-by-spec comparison of the two models, check out our iPhone 16 vs iPhone 16 Pro explainer.\nRead our full iPhone 16 review\nThe best value iPhone\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDespite the arrival of the iPhone 16 series, we still consider the standard iPhone 15 to be the best-value iPhone in 2025. What it lacks in titanium sides, 120Hz scrolling, or high-spec zoom photography, the standard iPhone 15 more than makes up for in performance and portability.\nFor just $699 / \u00a3699 / AU$1,249 from Apple directly, you get a 6.1-inch Super XDR OLED display, a fast A16 Bionic chipset, a USB-C port, a supremely capable 48MP main camera, and Apple\u2019s smart digital screen cut-out, the Dynamic Island, all delivered in a sleek and eye-catching design package.\nYou do lose out on Apple Intelligence compatibility with the iPhone 15, so if you're ready to embrace smartphone AI and want a future-proof pocket companion, the iPhone 16 is the better buy. However, if you're simply looking for a speedy, long-lasting, and eye-catching iPhone to see you through the next three or four years, the iPhone 15 is an excellent choice.\nFor a spec-by-spec comparison of the two models, check out our iPhone 16 vs iPhone 15 explainer.\nRead our full iPhone 15 review\nThe best budget iPhone\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFollowing the launch of the iPhone 16e in February 2025, Apple discontinued both the iPhone SE (2022) and the iPhone 14, meaning the company's new entry-level iPhone 16 model is now the cheapest iPhone available as new.\nThe iPhone 16e brings several key upgrades over the iPhone SE (2022), including a 48MP main camera, a more powerful chipset, a longer-lasting battery, and Apple Intelligence compatibility. You'll have to make do with a physical notch instead of the Dynamic Island, and there's no MagSafe compatibility to speak of here, but the iPhone 16e is, after all, intended to be a no-frills model.\nIf you're looking for more bells and whistles, go for an iPhone 15 or an iPhone 16 (to see how the iPhone 16e stacks up against those more expensive models, check out our iPhone 16e vs iPhone 15 and iPhone 16e vs iPhone 16 comparisons), but put simply, this is the best budget iPhone available in 2025.\nRead our full iPhone 16e review\nThe best iPhone for battery life\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe iPhone 16 Plus takes everything great about the standard iPhone 16 and supersizes it, meaning this is the handset to go for if you prefer a larger iPhone but don't want to spend big on the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nThis year's model gets all the same benefits as the standard iPhone 16 \u2013 the Action button, the Camera Control button, Apple Intelligence compatibility, and so on \u2013 but the Plus also benefits from battery life that pretty much wipes the floor with its comparatively priced competition.\nIn our testing, the iPhone 16 Plus lasted a whopping 16 hours and 29 minutes; that's endurance to rival the iPhone 16 Pro Max. So, if battery life is your number one priority, we'd recommend going for this phone over the iPhone 16 Pro Max and saving yourself $300 / \u00a3300 / AU$550 (if you don't care about ProMotion, that is).\nRead our full iPhone 16 Plus review\nFAQs\nWhat is the best iPhone?\nThe best iPhone is usually one of the latest numbered models, but the value of each will depend on your specific needs. If you want a big screen, go for a Pro Max (the latest and greatest is the iPhone 16 Pro Max). For top specs in a smaller size, pick a Pro, and if you want to save some money, then get a standard model or the iPhone 16e.\nWhich iPhone is the best value for money?\nRight now, the iPhone that offers the best value for money is the iPhone 15, although the iPhone 16 is the more money-savvy choice if you're keen to use Apple Intelligence features. The iPhone 16e, meanwhile, is the outright cheapest iPhone, so go for that if you're simply looking for the most inexpensive option.\nHow to choose the best iPhone?\nA lot of iPhones are quite similar to one another, so choosing which model to buy mostly just means seeing what's different between them and finding the right fit for you.\nAll iPhones are powerful, and Apple supports them for a long time, so age and chipset needn't be a big deal, but if you don't plan on upgrading for a long time, then a newer model with a faster chipset is ideal.\nBigger factors, though, include the screen size \u2013 and bigger isn't always better. If you want something compact that you can easily slip into a small pocket, then consider Apple's 6.1-inch models. But if you plan on doing a lot of gaming or video-watching, something larger would be better.\nResolution and refresh rate are also worth paying attention to for the optimal visual experience \u2013 the higher the better in both cases, so ideal options will have things like a 120Hz refresh rate and a resolution above 1080p.\nCamera quality and battery life are important considerations, too, and you can't get a full picture of these just from a specs list, so read our full entries above (or click through to our detailed reviews) for insights into how each iPhone fares in those departments.\nHow we test\nWe've reviewed every iPhone on this list, meaning for each, we've passed our expert judgment on them after extensive testing. These reviews saw us use each phone as our main handset for at least a week, and often longer.\nIn the process, we would explore various use cases, including calls, texts, social media, video streaming, gaming, taking photos, and more, with some heavy use days and other lighter ones.\nIn short, we use our iPhones just like you would \u2013 but we make sure to test every key feature, as well as run benchmark tests, checking how long they take to charge, and more.\nUsing that data, we've then ranked each handset, factoring in price, value, and how they compare to one another, with a particular focus on their screens, designs, battery life, performance, and cameras.\n- You've reached the end of the page.

      "text": "Apple to Simplify iPhone 18 Camera Control Button, Not Remove It\nAn established Chinese leaker has pushed back against recent rumors suggesting Apple plans to eliminate the Camera Control button from the iPhone 18, instead claiming the company is working to simplify the component to reduce costs.\nAccording to Weibo leaker Instant Digital, the Camera Control's pressure-sensitive modules for the iPhone 18 series currently remain in trial production. However, Apple is reportedly removing the capacitive sensor from the current dual-sensor design, and opting instead to rely solely on pressure sensing to achieve all button functions.\nThe current Camera Control button on iPhone 16 models uses both capacitive and pressure sensors beneath a sapphire crystal surface. The capacitive layer detects touch gestures, while the force sensor recognizes different pressure levels for taps, presses, and swipes.\nInstant Digital says Apple's revised approach is similar to designs found in devices like the OPPO X8 Ultra and vivo X200 Ultra, where pressure sensors alone can recognize light taps, firm presses, and sliding gestures.\nThe leaker suggests cost concerns are driving the change, noting that the current solution is \"genuinely very expensive\" for Apple and is generating costly after-sales repairs. This is said to be creating \"significant internal cost pressure\" for Apple, especially since not all of its AI-powered Visual Intelligence features have fully rolled out yet, which is limiting the button's perceived value.\nInstant Digital has a decent track record for leaks, suggesting this is a genuine debunk of the recent report from another Weibo account indicating that Apple would drop the Camera Control from the iPhone 18 lineup due to low user engagement. Its removal would have been quite the reversal \u2013 Apple only debuted the Camera Control button on the iPhone 16 series last year.\nPopular Stories\nWe're only weeks away from Apple's annual iPhone event \u2013 rumored to take place on September 9 \u2013 and along with the new iPhone 17 series, we're going to get a new version of the Apple Watch Ultra for the first time since 2023.\nBy the time the Ultra 3 is unveiled, it will have been two years since the previous model arrived.

The button, which offers quick camera access and AI features, has received mixed reactions, yet Apple plans to retain it in a simplified form rather than eliminate it entirely. Meanwhile, rumors about the iPhone 17 line point to a price bump, a new camera layout on the Air model, and potential upgrades to the Pro models, but the core Camera Control feature is expected to persist across the upcoming releases.\"}",
