  "title": "ASUS ROG CETRA Gaming Earbuds Are Going for Peanuts in Best Buy\u2019s Clearance Sale",
  "description": "These earbuds aren't just comfy, but they can make just about any game you play feel much more cinematic.",
  "content": "Laggy audio can spoil a clutch win just as fast as a dropped connection. The ASUS ROG CETRA True Wireless In-Ear Gaming Earbuds aim to keep you locked in, whether you are grinding ranked matches at home or sneaking in a few rounds on a lunch break. Slip them in, tap to connect, and you get a clean, energetic sound that makes footsteps easier to pick out and voice chat easier to follow. They are light, pocket friendly, and ready for phones, tablets, laptops, and handhelds that support Bluetooth audio.\n\nHead over to Best Buy to get the ASUS ROG CETRA True Wireless In-Ear Gaming Earbuds for just $70, down from its usual price of $100. That\u2019s a discount of $30 and 30% off.\n\nSee at Best Buy\n\nSound is tuned with gaming in mind, so the mix pushes detail where it helps most. Footsteps and reloads sit clearly in the midrange, while bass has enough punch to make explosions feel lively without muddying dialogue. A game mode tightens the sync between what you see and what you hear, which helps timing in rhythm games and keeps action scenes feeling immediate during streams.\n\nNoise control is handled on both sides of the spectrum. When you want quiet, active noise cancellation lowers the background clatter from buses, coffee shops, and shared dorm spaces. When you need to hear what is going on around you, a quick tap brings in outside sound so you can catch a boarding call or a teammate\u2019s question from across the room. Multiple microphones work together to focus on your voice, so callouts land clearly and phone calls do not sound like you are underwater.\n\nComfort matters during long sessions, and the small shells sit securely without pinching. A few sizes of ear tips come in the box, so you can find the seal that keeps bass full and the earbuds steady during a jog. Touch controls handle the basics like play, pause, skip, and mode switching. The charging case slips into a jeans pocket and tops the buds back up between matches. USB-C charging keeps things simple, and a short pit stop on a cable before you head out buys extra playtime for the evening.\n\nOutside of games, the sound works well for daily life. Podcasts stay crisp, lo-fi playlists feel warm, and video voices stay easy to understand without cranking the volume. Sweat resistance helps at the gym, and the compact case makes these a natural travel companion next to a handheld console or e-reader.\n\nIf you want earbuds that pull double duty for gaming and everyday listening, this set checks a lot of boxes without crowding your bag or your budget. The ASUS ROG CETRA True Wireless In-Ear Gaming Earbuds are still available for $70 at Best Buy, a solid drop from the regular $100 price.\n\nSee at Best Buy",
