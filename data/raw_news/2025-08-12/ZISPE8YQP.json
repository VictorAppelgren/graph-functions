  "title": "2025 Preseason College Football Polls Dominated By The SEC And Big Ten",
  "description": "Led by No. 1 Texas, the Big Ten and SEC combine to occupy seven of the top nine spots in both the AP and coaches' polls, and 11 of the top 15.",
  "content": "The super conference model is not yet a part of the college football landscape. It might as well be, however, as the SEC and Big Ten continue to operate within a sphere far removed the others. Such proof can once again be found in the top 25 preseason polls where the two conferences combine to occupy 16 spots in the AP and 15 in the coaches\u2019. The tally was 15/15 last year.\n\nLed by No. 1 Texas, the Big Ten and SEC together occupy seven of the top nine spots in both polls, and 11 of the top 15. Such dominance, of course, is in part a byproduct of the rich getting richer. Both conferences added inventory following the 2023-24 season when the SEC expanded to 16 teams by welcoming Texas and Oklahoma from the Big 12, and the Big Ten swelled to 18 teams with the addition of USC, UCLA, Oregon and Washington from the Pac-12.\n\nIt all makes for an even juicier heavyweight matchup August 30 when the top-ranked Longhorns travel to Columbus to meet the No. 3/2 Buckeyes in the season opener for both. The teams met in a CFP semifinal last season with eventual national champ Ohio State prevailing, 28-14.\n\nLed by the Super 2, here are a few (alphabetical) observations from the preseason polls ahead of the season kicking off August 23 in Dublin with a Big 12 clash between No. 17/20 Kansas State and No. 22/21 Iowa State.\n\nThe No. 8/8 Crimson Tide do not open as a top-five team for the first time since Nick Saban\u2019s initial season in Tuscaloosa. That was 2008 when \u2018Bama was No. 24/NR before reeling off 16 straight appearances in the top five of both polls. By the way, the Tide went 12-2 in Saban\u2019s debut on the Bryant-Denny Stadium home sideline and finished No. 6/6. Kalen DeBoer went 9-4 and No. 17 in both polls in his 2024 debut with Alabama.\n\nThe Sun Devils went from consecutive 3-9 seasons to the playoff last year and there is belief among the pollsters that third-year coach Kenny Dillingham has his squad poised for more good things in 2025 even with running back Cam Skattebo in the NFL. In fact, the No. 11/11 preseason showing is the Sun Devils\u2019 highest since opening at No. 8/9 in 1998, a season that resulted in a 5-6 mark under Bruce Snyder.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 pulling up the bottom of both polls is notable for the fact no non-power conference team was ranked in either poll heading into the 2024 season. Spencer Danielson\u2019s team started 3-1 last season with the only loss by a field goal at Oregon. BSU worked its way into the top 10 and, as the leader of the pack among the Group Five, advanced to the playoff where they lost to Penn State in the Fiesta Bowl. Heisman finalist Ashton Jeanty is in the NFL, though plenty of production on both sides returns, including junior quarterback Maddux Madsen.\n\nThe No. 15/17 Gators return to the preseason polls following a three-year hiatus. In fact, it has been since the 1960s that they went four straight years without being included. A strong finish to 2024 \u2013 four straight wins, including over ranked LSU and Ole Miss \u2013 resulted in an 8-5 season and plenty of optimism that rolled into the offseason in Gainesville. That optimism carries over big time thanks largely to quarterback D.J. Lagway, who could very well be part of the Heisman conversation in his first season as the starter out of the chute.\n\nMake it eight straight years the No. 5/4 Bulldogs have appeared in the top five of both preseason polls. In a larger picture that begins in 2012 under Mark Richt, UGA has now opened in the top 10 in 11 of 14 years. Believe it or not, the 2025 season is Kirby Smart\u2019s 10th at the helm in Athens. His first season (2016, preseason No. 18) was the last time Georgia opened outside the top 15.\n\nThe last time No. 12/12 Illinois and No. 20/19 Indiana (below) were in the preseason polls together? You can stop searching because this is a first. Bret Bielema\u2019s Fighting Illini were one of five Big Ten teams with at least 10 wins last year (10-3), which was the first such season for Illinois since Ron Turner led his squad to a 10-2 mark and Sugar Bowl appearance in 2001. The good feeling heading into this season swirls around a bevy of returning starters on both sides of scrimmage, including QB Luke Altmyer and DB Xavier Scott.\n\nThis marks the second time this decade the No. 20/19 Hoosiers open a season in the top 25 after concluding the previous one in the polls. See also 2020-21 under Tom Allen. Curt Cignetti\u2019s first season in Bloomington was a magic carpet ride of sorts as an 11-2 campaign (that began 10-0 ) represented the first time in school history the Hoosiers won more than nine games. While Oregon and Penn State played for the Big Ten conference title, Indiana went straight to the playoff, a first-round defeat at Notre Dame. Quarterback Kurtis Rourke was one-and-done at IU, and filling his shoes is a major task.\n\nThe No. 6/5 Fighting Irish are the highest ranked non-B10/SEC team in the coaches\u2019 poll, though Clemson, at No. 4, has that distinction in the AP. Coach Marcus Freeman will turn to a new starting quarterback \u2013 either redshirt freshman C.J. Carr or sophomore Kenny Minchey \u2013 during a demanding start to the season that features a trip to Miami and visit from Texas A&M.\n\nThe last time the No. 3/2 Buckeyes were not in the preseason rankings? That was 1988 in John Cooper\u2019s first season and with the Buckeyes were coming off a 6-4-1 campaign in Earle Bruce\u2019s final year at the helm in Columbus. Things got worse before they got better under Cooper as Ohio State went 4-6-1 in '88. The Buckeyes extended their record of being ranked in the preseason to 72 years. This is also the 13th straight year they will open among the top six teams.\n\nThere is no greater disparity in the polls than the Sooners checking in at No. 18 in the AP and being the best of the rest among the coaches who voted. With 221 voting points in the latter, OU is 25 points in arrears of No. 25 Boise State. This marks the third consecutive preseason the Sooners are outside the top 10, something that last happened 1996-2000, a stretch that included four years being unranked.\n\nIt was 40 years ago that the No. 16/16 Mustangs were last ranked in the preseason. A death penalty, continued residency in Southwest Conference and membership in the WAC, Conference USA, American and, currently, the ACC, have followed since Bobby Collins\u2019 squad opened the 1985 season at No. 3. Alas, this was no Pony Express of Eric Dickerson/Craig James fame. Rather, the season was a ho-hum 6-5. Such a record looked like something special given the Mustangs, thanks to their NCAA-imposed two-year ban (1987-88) from the gridiron, would not win more than a half dozen games until 2009. The 2025 season will be their second enjoying the riches of the ACC.\n\nSteve Spurrier was in charge when the Gamecocks last appeared in the preseason polls in 2014. That was the last full season in Columbia for the \u2018Head Ball Coach\u2019 following a trio of 11-2 showings, seasons that were capped by bowl wins and top-10 finishes. Shane Beamer has a pair of postseason rankings on his resume in four years as South Carolina\u2019s coach, incluidng No. 19/19 last season. This year marks the first time the No. 13/13 Gamecocks open a season ranked on his watch.\n\nThe preseason polls represent the first time the No. 23/24 Red Raiders are ranked at any point since they appeared at No. 25 for one week in 2018 under Kliff Kingsbury. A decade earlier, Mike Leach\u2019s squad soared as high as No. 2 before winding up the 2008 season where they started: at No. 12. That was Tech\u2019s last appearance in the preseason top 25.",

      "text": "The Notre Dame Fighting Irish are looking to put together another strong season, and this time, finish the job they couldn't last year. In the 2025 season, the Fighting Irish are going to rely on a young quarterback to lead them back to the College Football Playoffs.\nAccording to Pete Nakos of On3.com, the two Notre Dame quarterbacks vying for the starting job are in a heated battle for the position. Those two quarterbacks are CJ Carr and Kenny Minchey.\n\"When Steven Angeli transferred to Syracuse this spring,\" Nakos writes, Notre Dame's quarterback competition turned into a two-way battle between Kenny Minchey and CJ Carr. One source told On3 this past week that it is neck-and-neck with no clear separation.\"\nThis tight competition is one that'll be tough for Marcus Freeman to decide on. But Nakos brings up a key point that could turn the tide in Minchey's favor: Carr was sidelined for all of 2024.\n\"Minchey has the most college experience and more experience practicing in Mike Denbrock's system with Carr sidelined last year,\" Nakos writes, \"and that could prove to be a difference-maker when Marcus Freeman makes a decision.\"\nThe Notre Dame starting job is an important one, and with the competition still fierce, the starter isn't known as of yet.\nMORE: Notre Dame football's interest in joining Big Ten revealed\nBut, while competition could be good, the fact that neither is standing out isn't a great sign. If both were looking great, the wording might be similar, but there would be a lot more open optimism.\nAnd yet, there is still a competition going on for the starting quarterback job, despite the season being on the horizon. Notre Dame's starting quarterback in week one will have won the job, and it's going to be a close one, with either Carr or Minchey capable of winning the job.\nWith both lacking experience, the Fighting Irish quarterback spot might not be as strong as it could be. This report from Nakos indicates that neither has stood out as of yet.\nWhile there's time for one to separate from the other, the quarterback competition typically isn't a good sign, especially this late into the process. Carr and Minchey are in a tight competition, one that is of utmost importance heading into 2025.\nMORE NCAAF NEWS:\n- Michigan starting quarterback still an 'open competition' according to Sherrone Moore\n- Oregon receives negative injury update involving 5-star freshman\n- College football updated polls: AP Top 25, Coaches Poll rankings released for 2025 season\n- Abdul Carter calls for fellow Penn State star rusher Micah Parsons to get paid\n- Oregon's Jeremiah McClellan reveals reason for Ohio State commitment flip"

      "text": "SMU Banned From Playing Football in \u201987\n- Share via\nDALLAS \u2014 Citing evidence of a slush fund to pay players, the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. has levied its most severe penalties ever against a major college football program, suspending Southern Methodist University for the 1987 season.\nAccording to the sanctions, revealed during a Wednesday press conference at SMU\u2019s student center, the Mustangs may resume playing football in the fall of 1988. But their schedule for that season has been reduced from 11 games to 7, all away from home.\nOther restrictions placed upon SMU by the NCAA, including a significant reduction in the number of football scholarships the university may offer during the next two years, are expected to limit the Mustangs\u2019 ability to compete with other Division I-A schools for several years.\nThe NCAA\u2019s decision, however, fell short of the maximum sentence established in Section 7-(D) of the enforcement procedures, the so-called \u201cdeath penalty.\u201d\nThe Mustangs could have been suspended for two years under the rule, which applies to universities found guilty of committing major rules violations less than five years after receiving sanctions for prior violations.\nSince the rule was passed in June 1985 at an NCAA special convention, SMU was the first repeat offender to appear before the NCAA\u2019s Committee on Infractions.\nAfter discovering 36 violations in the football program, the NCAA placed the Mustangs on probation for three years in August 1985.\nThis is the seventh time since 1958 that SMU has been on probation, an NCAA record not listed in the press brochure along with those set on the field by former SMU All-Americans such as Doak Walker, Kyle Rote, Don Meredith and Eric Dickerson.\nSMU has fielded a team every year since 1915, appearing in 11 postseason games, including the 1936 Rose Bowl.\nThe Mustangs won at least 10 games in each of four seasons between 1981 and 1984 and were ranked No. 2 with an 11-0-1 record in 1982.\nBut as Meredith might say, \u201cTurn out the lights; the party\u2019s over.\u201d\nIn its report, the Infractions Committee said: \u201cNot only is Southern Methodist University a repeat major violator, but its past record of violations is nothing short of abysmal.\n\u201cThese violations and additional past infractions cases demonstrated that numerous individuals associated with the university\u2019s athletics program, including key staff members and outside representatives, have been committed to achieving athletics success through deliberate and flagrant violations of fundamental NCAA rules.\u201d\nThe NCAA\u2019s director of enforcement, David Berst, said the penalties might have been more severe if SMU officials had not cooperated with the NCAA investigation.\nHe said the NCAA would not have been able to prove the existence of the slush fund without evidence presented by SMU.\nWilliam B. Stallcup, SMU\u2019s interim president, said the university will not appeal.\n\u201cThe temporary loss of football will be a bitter outcome for some,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut, as a university, we accept it, knowing that, in our recent dealings with the football program and the NCAA, we have done what is right and that we have conducted ourselves in a manner befitting our university.\u201d\nWhen appearing before the Infractions Committee 13 days ago in Coronado, Calif., Stallcup and Lonnie D. Kliever, SMU\u2019s faculty athletic representative, recommended punishment that was significantly less severe.\nBesides a reduction in the size of the coaching staff and the number of scholarships that could be offered, they suggested the elimination of two non-conference games during each of the next two seasons.\nAs a member of the Southwest Conference, SMU regularly plays eight games against other members and three games against teams outside the conference, although only two non-conference games had been officially scheduled in each of the next two seasons.\nThe NCAA\u2019s enforcement staff\u2019s recommendations varied only in that they stipulated the Mustangs should be prevented from playing any non-conference games during the next two seasons.\nBut the six-member Infractions Committee, chaired by Dr. Frank Remington of the University of Wisconsin, delivered a decision that stunned many who were affected.\nBerst indicated that the Infractions Committee also delivered a message to other universities.\n\u201cThe Infractions Committee takes very seriously the position prescribed by the NCAA,\u201d he said, referring to the 1985 death-penalty legislation.\n\u201cI think this action has some deterrent value for institutions inclined to follow the example of SMU.\u201d\nBesides the suspension for the 1987 season and the reduced schedule in 1988, sanctions against SMU include:\n--No football practice, except for conditioning programs, until the spring of 1988.\n--A reduction in the coaching staff to a head coach and five full-time assistants. Other Division I-A universities are allowed eight full-time assistants.\n--No football scholarships for the 1987-88 academic year, 15 for 1988-89. The NCAA recently adopted a rule allowing universities 25 scholarships a year, down from 30 in recent years.\n--No off-campus recruiting until Aug. 1, 1988, one month before the Mustangs resume playing. No prospective players will be allowed to visit the campus at the university\u2019s expense until the beginning of the 1988-89 academic year.\n\u201cThe present administration of the university has expressed its hope for a new beginning in athletics,\u201d the Infractions Committee\u2019s report said.\n\u201cCanceling the football season in 1987 will afford an opportunity for the university to start a new football program based on integrity and fair play, rather than on wrongdoing and deception.\u201d\nBerst delivered the decision to SMU officials Tuesday. It was announced at Wednesday\u2019s news conference, which was televised live by Dallas\u2019 CBS affiliate.\nOn a gloomy, rainy morning, the SMU players who have eligibility remaining were summoned to the football offices at Ownby Stadium to watch the proceedings on closed-circuit television.\nThe 52 players on scholarships learned that their scholarships will be honored at SMU but that they also are free to transfer to other universities and play next season. Under normal circumstances, transfer students are ineligible for one year before they can resume playing.\nJeffrey Jacobs, a junior wide receiver from Dallas, said he believes as many as 30 of the players will transfer.\nCompounding the drama of Wednesday morning\u2019s announcement, moments after Berst read the Infractions Committee\u2019s report to about 100 members of the media, he staggered to the door and passed out.\nStallcup explained that Berst had complained of flu symptoms.\nAs Stallcup read a prepared statement, he was interrupted by the siren of an approaching ambulance.\nBut after an examination by paramedics, Berst returned to the auditorium.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more embarrassing to me than anything else,\u201d Berst said.\nThen, turning to Stallcup and Kliever, he said: \u201cYou may even have enjoyed that.\u201d\nThat was disputed by Kliever, who said: \u201cThat\u2019s a quick and easy way to get out of answering questions.\u201d\nKliever, a professor of religious studies, said he was \u201cdeeply embarrassed and regretful\u201d about the notoriety the football program has brought to SMU.\nAs for the university\u2019s decision to cooperate with the NCAA, Kliever said: \u201cWe wanted to undercut any temptation to place the blame on the NCAA for our problems. We wanted no cries of investigative harassment or selective enforcement to cloud the issue of blame or credit. We wanted to take the responsibility for correcting as well as reporting our problems.\u201d\nUniversity officials were less contrite following the announcement of probation in 1985, when they threatened legal action against the NCAA.\nUnder the terms of that penalty, the Mustangs lost television and bowl appearances for two years as well as all 30 of their scholarships in 1986 and 15 in 1987.\nAthletic department officials also were ordered to police the activities of nine prominent boosters, who allegedly were involved in the violations.\nThat was August 1985.\nOne month later, according to the investigation, one of the boosters, who has not been identified, resumed payments to 13 football players.\nThe payments, made between September 1985 and December 1986, ranged from $50 to $725. The payments reportedly were funneled through an athletic department official with the knowledge of other staff members.\n\u201cCertain key athletic department staff members agreed that promises made to student athletes prior to the 1984-85 academic year during the young men\u2019s recruitment should continue to be fulfilled,\u201d the Infractions Committee\u2019s report said.\n\u201cPrevious cash payments to the student-athletes had gone undetected by the NCAA, and the involved staff members agreed to continue the payments and to distribute them to the young men. It was understood that such payments would not be made to new student-athletes.\u201d\nStallcup would not identify the staff members involved, saying they had been granted anonymity in return for information that could be presented to NCAA investigators.\nHead Coach Bobby Collins and Athletic Director Bob Hitch resigned in December.\nUniversity President Donald Shields had previously resigned, citing ill health.\nStallcup, who has replaced Shields on an interim basis, said a committee has been formed to study the future of SMU\u2019s football program and whether it will continue in Division I-A.\nSMU\u2019s board of governors previously announced the end of a special admissions program for athletes. Instead of receiving special treatment, athletes will have to meet the same standards as other students to enroll in the university.\n\u201cI find outrage in the community, inside and outside SMU, that we have allowed this to happen and that it has continued since two years ago,\u201d Stallcup said.\n\u201cThe attitude is, \u2018Get your problems solved and then take steps to assure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u2019\n\u201cAs for what we\u2019ll have to do to achieve that, who knows?\u201d\nTHE PENALTIES\nNCAA\u2019S ACTION AGAINST SMU FOOTBALL PROGRAM WEDNESDAY:\nSchedule: SMU is banned from playing football in 1987 and limited to a restricted 1988 schedule. SMU can play only seven Southwest Conference games in 1988--none at home. SMU loses non-conference games against Oklahoma and New Mexico in 1987 and against Oklahoma and Notre Dame in 1988 at an estimated cost to the school of more than $500,000.\nTV, Bowl Games: SMU is barred from television and bowl appearances in 1988.\nProbation: The probation, SMU\u2019s seventh since 1958 and the third this decade, lasts until 1990.\nCoaches: SMU is limited to a head football coach and five full-time assistant coaches until August 1989. It usually has eight assistant coaches.\nScholarships, Recruiting: SMU can award no scholarships in 1987 and only 15 in 1988. SMU normally awards 25 scholarships a year. Off-campus recruiting is prohibited until August 1988. SMU\u2019s 52 scholarship football players are free to transfer immediately to other schools without loss of eligibility."

      "text": "Boise State traveled to Eugene on the second Saturday of the 2024 college football season and led No. 7 Oregon early in the fourth quarter. The unranked Broncos went down in defeat on a field goal as time expired, though Spencer Danielson\u2019 team served notice that it would be one to be reckoned with.\nWhile the Ducks ascended to No. 1 by the end of October and eventually lost the national championship to Ohio State, the Broncos galloped through the Mountain West, climbed to No. 8 and made their way to State College where they lost (31-14) to the Nittany Lions in a College Football Playoff game that was a one-score affair with 10 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. The defeat halted an 11-game win streak and concluded a 12-2 season.\nNo longer with the services of Heisman runner-up Ashton Jeanty, the No. 6 selection of the Las Vegas Raiders after leading the nation with 186 yards rushing per game, the easy question is whether Boise State has enough offensive production to reign supreme and represent the Group of Five in the 12-team CFP once again. The easy answer? Yes.\nCertainly, that is the case if you believe the three major print preview publications (Athlon, Lindy\u2019s and Phil Steele) that began to appear on magazine shelves around Memorial Day. There is no reason to think otherwise as the Broncos head into their final season as a member of the Mountain West before moving to what will be a nine-team Pac-12.\nEven with Jeanty, defensive end Ahmed Hassanein and safety Seyi Oladipo in the NFL, Danielson is not lacking when it comes to returning playmakers. Indeed, quarterback Maddux Madsen will operate behind an experienced line and again have Matt Lauter, one of the nation\u2019s top tight ends, among his targets. The running game should more than hold its own thanks in part to portal acquisition Malik Sherrod (Fresno State) and the continued development of Sire Gaines, who got his feet wet last season.\nMeanwhile, a defense that averaged 3.9 sacks per game to rank second nationally, should again be stout despite key losses. That is thanks to the return of, among others, end Jayden Virgin-Morgan (team-high 10 sacks), safety Ty Bennefield (leading tackler) and corner A\u2019Marion McCoy (14 PBUs).\nFor the third time in five full seasons the Broncos open in the Sunshine State when they meet USF for a Thursday evening affair August 28 in Tampa. A tricky spot in the schedule is an Oct. 4 trip to Notre Dame one week after hosting Appalachian State, whose 2024 slip below .500 is likely temporary.\nTulane among others to watch\nWhile Phil Steele has Toledo (No. 25) and Memphis (No. 27) at least knocking on the door of G5 supremacy, only three other teams -- James Madison, Navy and Tulane -- are in the top 60 of each publication, which serves to underscore the thought of how wide open it is among the non-power conferences.\nThere is agreement when it comes to the Green Wave, who are ranked tightly from No. 43 to No. 48 while the Midshipmen range from No. 40 to No. 54. Phil Steele has JMU at No. 32, far ahead of Lindy\u2019s and Athlon, which have the Dukes at No. 58 and No. 59, respectively.\nTulane is 32-10 with three American championship game appearances (one win) in as many years, including Jon Sumrall\u2019s first as coach in New Orleans last season. While the defense has four of its top five tacklers returning, the offense endured major blows with the departures of quarterback Darian Mensah, who transferred to Duke \u2013 Guess who\u2019s coming to Yulman Stadium on September 13? -- after placing sixth nationally in pass efficiency, and running back Makhi Hughes, who left for Oregon after rushing for 2,779 yards and 22 touchdowns in two seasons. In addition, the top three wideouts expired their eligibility and the No. 1 tight end transferred to Miami. (Note: The Green Wave added former BYU quarterback Jake Retzlaff on July 21.)\nKaden Semonza (Ball State) and Brendan Sullivan (Iowa/Northwestern), who arrived in June, will battle it out at QB and behind a line in need of three new starters. In addition to Duke and the reunion with Mensah, the schedule the season\u2019s first four weeks also includes the opener versus Northwestern and a trip to Ole Miss.\nNavy won 10 games last season, including over service academy rival Army and against Oklahoma in the Armed Forces Bowl. While the offensive line had three starters graduate, much of the offense returns, including quarterback Blake Horvath, who was the American\u2019s third-leading rusher and totaled 30 touchdowns. Though the top three tacklers, led by linebacker and the American\u2019s leading tackler, Colin Ramos, graduated, there is plenty of talent and depth returning on a defense that was third in the conference in allowing 22.2 points a year ago.\nThe back end of Navy\u2019s schedule is demanding with a trip to South Bend, a visit from USF, Thanksgiving turkey in Memphis, and the traditional clash with Army, which will be in Baltimore for the first time since 2016.\nJames Madison is 28-9 in its three seasons of FBS affiliation, each as a member of the Sun Belt in which they are 17-7. Bob Chesney took over for Curt Cignetti, who did wonders at Indiana, and went 9-4 as a first-year FBS coach in 2024. The big question heading into preseason camp is the health of quarterback Alonza Barnett. The junior threw 26 TDs and only four INTs before tearing an ACL in the regular-season finale. Hence, it should not surprise if Matthew Sluka, who played under Chesney at Holy Cross for two seasons before transferring to UNLV last year, takes over the offense at least initially.\nThe Sun Belt\u2019s top scoring defense (20.5) a year ago had four of its top six tacklers depart and new DC Colin Hitschler\u2019s unit will be challenged in the season\u2019s opening month with trips to Louisville and Liberty as well as a conference opener versus Georgia Southern."

      "text": "TAMPA, Fla. \u2013 Much of the build-up among Gator Nation heading into Friday afternoon\u2019s Gasparilla Bowl against Tulane swirled around quarterback DJ Lagway. After all, it was the true freshman who was a savior of sorts in starting the final six games of the regular season and helping lead the Gators\u2019 turnaround from 4-5, and daily calls for coach Billy Napier to be canned, into 7-5.\nMake it 8-5 as Florida defeated the Green Wave at Raymond James Stadium, 33-8, in front of 41,472 mostly UF fans.\n\u201cTo see Gator Nation out there in full force was special,\u201d said Napier. \u201cGreat to finish the right way and I am really proud of our players.\u201d\nLagway made several nice throws, though there were a few of the head-scratching variety. A late-first half interception in the end zone was particularly puzzling as there was not an open receiver. Another pick was into triple coverage.\nREAD: USF Football Actual Home Attendance In 2024\nLagway was not only a culprit in a first half that saw the Gators outgain Tulane, 269-62, but hurt themselves with penalties and ineffective play in the red zone. The result was only a 9-0 lead on a trio of Trey Smack field goals.\nHowever, when all was said and done, Lagway completed 22 of 35 passes for 305 yards and a touchdown to earn MVP honors. The Gators finished with 529 yards.\n\u201cNot taking care of the ball, but the guys rallied around me and we came out and played a much better second half,\u201d said the 6-foot-3, 240-pound Lagway.\nFacing backup quarterback and Oregon transfer Ty Thompson after starter Darian Mensah (sixth nationally in pass efficiency) transferred to Duke, the Gators were able to key on the Green Wave\u2019s running game and limited star running back Makhi Hughes to 29 yards on eight carries. UF held Tulane to 194 yards and 11 first downs.\nThe win, which gave the Gators a 25-24 mark in bowl games, closed the season with a four-game win streak.\n\u201cI was so impressed with how the players took ownership and the players bringing solutions to the table,\u201d said Napier. \u201cAll of a sudden, you have confidence that you can play with anybody, and that\u2019s what happened about midway through the season.\u201d\nPlease make a small donation to the Tampa Free Press to help sustain independent journalism.

      "text": "You know something special is taking place when Indiana defeats Michigan after netting all of 18 yards in the second half. Alas, special things have been taking place in Bloomington all season. Defeating the Wolverines, and at home, was certainly a headliner. After all, the Hoosiers were 2-42 \u2013 2-42!! \u2014 against the maize and blue since 1967.\nThe hope among the faithful is that the wins continue to pile up in what remains of a season that has the Hoosiers checking in at No. 5 in the second CFP ranking. That hope includes playing into January. At this rate, it is difficult to doubt Curt Cignetti\u2019s team?\nIndiana, along with Oregon, BYU and Army, remains undefeated as the schedule reaches the middle of November. While a 10-win season (10-0/7-0 Big Ten) is unprecedented, if not unimaginable in the history of IU football, well, imagine this: prior to the 20-15 verdict over Michigan, Cignetti\u2019s squad defeated each of its previous nine opponents by at least 14 points. They defeated six foes by at least 24 points!\nThe Hoosiers, though, showed something they did not have to the previous nine weeks, and that was the ability to win the close one, the tough one, the gritty one. A true Big Ten-type win, if you will.\n\u201cIt reflects our competitive character,\u201d Cignetti said after the game, played in front of 53,082 at Memorial Stadium.\nPerhaps defensive lineman CJ West summed it up best.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\n\u201cWe don't blink,\u201d said the redshirt senior, who transferred from Kent State. \u201cWe have a warrior mentality that we can stop anybody at any time. We prepare for this.\u201d\nComplementary football\nThe mentality West noted is reflected statistically as the Hoosiers boast the nation\u2019s stingiest run defense (72 yards per game) and are third in total defense (256 yards). It adds up to a team yielding all of 13.8 points per game to rank seventh.\nPenetration has been key under first-year coordinator Bryant Haines, who was on Cignetti\u2019s staff at James Madison and Elon. His unit leads the Big Ten and is 13th nationally in tackles for loss with 7.3 per game.\nEdge rusher Mikail Kamara and tackle James Carpenter followed Cignetti and Haines from Harrisonburg and have been an impactful duo to say the least. Kamara, a Lott Trophy (character and performance) semifinalist, is among the nation\u2019s leaders in sacks (9.5) and tackles for loss (14.5) while Carpenter has four sacks and eight tackles for loss. Sophomore defensive back Amare Ferrell is second in the Big Ten with four interceptions.\nThe other side of scrimmage has been impressive as well. The Hoosiers have scored 59 touchdowns in their 10 games, a total that includes 57 by the offense to tie Miami for the nation\u2019s top figure. Quarterback Kurtis Rourke provided Cignetti and OC Mike Shanahan, who like Haines worked under Cignetti at James Madison and Elon, with ample experience via the portal having started 33 games at Ohio. The sixth-year player\u2019s impact in his new environs has been rather resounding in that he is second nationally in pass efficiency (Jaxson Dart) while leading a team averaging 43.9 points, which is second in the nation to Miami\u2019s 45.0.\nThe Canadian-born (Ontario) Rourke, who missed the Oct. 26 game versus visiting Washington with a banged up thumb, has thrown 21 touchdown passes with only four interceptions in 238 attempts. His completion percentage of 71.8 is fifth nationally and is, in no small part, a byproduct of the time and space provided by a line recognized for its effort.\n\u201cWe really felt confident that we could have a special season this year,\u201d said Rourke, in the aftermath of the win over Michigan. \u201cIt is not necessarily a surprise, but you love to be 10-0. The goal at the beginning of the year is to win every game.\u201d\nSpecial teams play shall not be overlooked. Blocked kicks, clutch field goals, punts pinning the opposition deep and the return game, especially on punts \u2014 see Ke\u2019Shawn Williams\u2019 22-yarder in the fourth quarter versus Michigan as proof \u2014 have all had an unmistakable impact.\nLook ahead\nFollowing a bye this week, the Hoosiers will prepare for a date in Columbus against No. 2 Ohio State (8-1/5-1 Big Ten). The matchup represents not only another opportunity to keep the good times rolling, but defeat another conference power that has long tormented IU. The Buckeyes have won 28 straight in the series dating to a tie in 1990. Indiana\u2019s last win was 1988 in Bloomington, 41-7, and the most recent victory in Columbus was 1987, 31-10. Bill Mallory was on the IU sideline for both matchups.\nThe Old Oaken Bucket is on the line when the regular season concludes with a visit from Purdue (1-8/0-6 Big Ten) on Nov. 30. The Hoosiers will be intent on turning the tables after the \u2018P\u2019 has been affixed to the bucket three straight years and five of the last six. The Boilermakers lead the all-time series 77-42-6 and have a 63-32-3 mark since the trophy was first awarded in 1925.\nThe Big Ten championship game is Dec. 7 in Indianapolis, about an hour north of Bloomington. First things first as there is a job to do and help might be needed in a conference boasting four of the top five teams in the second CFP ranking."

The upcoming season features notable matchups, including Texas facing Ohio State, and highlights the struggles of teams like Alabama, which is not in the top five for the first time since 2008. Additionally, the quarterback competition at Notre Dame remains tight between CJ Carr and Kenny Minchey, raising concerns about the team's readiness as the season approaches.",
