  "description": "Familiar trends surfaced that have killed fast starts in the past in the 34-27 loss to the Eagles.",
  "content": "Zac Taylor wasn\u2019t pleased. Not that the Bengals head coach should be coming off a 34-27 defeat in Philadelphia, extending the preseason winless streak to seven.\n\nHe wanted this game to be different. He played his starters against the Eagles\u2019 backups, he enjoyed the glory of a midseason form performance from Joe Burrow and he entered with an urgency to make this year feel different from the previous by starting faster out of the gate.\n\nInstead, the 2025 preseason opener looked a whole lot like the 2024 regular season.\n\nThe offense shone while the defense looked lost, special teams misfired and all phases played undisciplined football. And, oh yeah, the Bengals scored 27 points, and it wasn\u2019t nearly enough.\n\nEveryone had seen this show before, and \u2014 even in the preseason \u2014 they sounded sick of it.\n\n\u201cOverall, just as a team, this was a team effort in the loss,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe gave up seven points on field goals. We lined up offside on a field goal; they missed it, they got three points. We hit the center on a field goal that turned into a touchdown. So that ended up being a four-point drive set, seven points right there. Penalty on a long kickoff return that we had given up, long punt return, threw an interception, and gave them the ball in scoring position. And so those are all things that, as a team, we can\u2019t tolerate. We\u2019ve got to play better team football than that. I expect our guys to fight these guys, come back, and they give us a chance at the end that I appreciate, but there\u2019s a lot of things that we have to fix and correct as a team. That\u2019s not one unit, that\u2019s not one person, that\u2019s not one position. It is a whole team effort that we got to fix in order to win our next game.\u201d\n\nEven Burrow took on shades of his 2024 post-games, downplaying his own success and offering a motivational tone toward the rest of the team.\n\n\u201cWe got to be better,\u201d Burrow said. \u201cToo many procedural penalties, too many errors. Things like that are going to happen, but I think it just wasn\u2019t clean enough across the board.\u201d\n\nThe amplified frustration, even at this point in the preseason, serves as another symbol of the internal pressure everyone is feeling to hit the ground running early this year. This many mistakes weren\u2019t going to be excused or downplayed. It should be an interesting 11 days between now and Monday Night Football in Washington.\n\nUntil then, let\u2019s take a deeper look at who impressed, who struggled and one player who made me ask a question.\n\nDylan Fairchild. One of the most interesting figures in Thursday\u2019s game was going to be the third-round pick. The Bengals made clear on draft night they were clearing the path for him to start at left guard and haven\u2019t relented on that messaging throughout training camp. Still, the question remained: would he look out of place in his debut with two high-end starters on either side of him? He didn\u2019t just look the part, but he posted a few impressive blocks while not allowing any pressures on Burrow.\n\nOn one pitch to Chase Brown, Fairchild perfectly executed a reach block to seal off the hole, and Brown broke up the middle for his longest run of the night. Granted, this wasn\u2019t the Super Bowl Eagles\u2019 defensive starters, but this had a chance to be ugly in his first start. It wasn\u2019t in the least. It feels a lot easier trotting Fairchild out in front of Burrow Week 1 in Cleveland after seeing those two drives.\n\nChase Brown. While everyone will circulate clips of Ja\u2019Marr Chase\u2019s ridiculous back-shoulder, toe-tap catch or 36-yard touchdown reception, what stood out on the drive was how dangerous this offense will be featuring Brown for a full season.\n\nHis burst in the passing game, zipping up the sideline, turning a checkdown into an explosive play and his explosiveness running up the middle in the tweaked Bengals\u2019 running attack were notable. He was as dynamic as can be after taking over last year, but looked poised to even add another element to his game.\n\nBurrow-Chase. Fans are so lucky to get to watch these two play together. That\u2019s all.\n\nTanner Hudson. Hudson\u2019s productivity in camp enjoyed a notable bump after the signing of Noah Fant put his spot on the bubble. He built on it in a big way on Thursday, grabbing six receptions for 62 yards and two touchdowns. It wasn\u2019t just the plays; it was the Bengals staff giving him the runway. Hudson was in with the starters, catching the touchdown from Burrow by bullying his way into the end zone, but also in with third-string QB Desmond Ridder toe-tapping for a score last in the fourth quarter.\n\nHudson\u2019s been in the middle of many big games during his two seasons in Cincinnati and has big fans in the quarterback room. If there was a plan to push Hudson out with the Fant signing, he made that exponentially harder in Philadelphia.\n\nDJ Ivey. The 2023 seventh-round pick created positive buzz for himself in camp and earned an opportunity to play a significant amount of snaps on Thursday. This was a critical night for a player battling for position on the back of the roster. It went terribly. Ivey got flipped around and looked lost on a slant. He got beaten deep by Darius Cooper right before halftime and then was offside on the 55-yard missed field goal attempt from Jake Elliiot. It\u2019s one thing for a guy to make a play on you, it\u2019s another to look lost, not understand a game situation and make a critical procedural error. A rough night that saps the life out of him breaking into a more prominent defensive role.\n\nIsaiah Williams. Williams had just one target on Thursday night. No, the lack of volume wasn\u2019t the issue. It was what happened on that one target. Jake Browning did a decent job getting the ball off to him in traffic on third down. It might not have been the most advisable pass, but it hit Williams right in the hands, went through them and bounced off his helmet into the air. It should have been intercepted, but it fell to the ground. That kind of a rep can\u2019t be on tape when you are battling for the final roster spot and trying to force a team to keep you around as the sixth wide receiver. They aren\u2019t going to bury him because of one play, but that didn\u2019t help.\n\nRight guard/swing tackle. It might be time to move Cody Ford back out to tackle or sign somebody (it\u2019s actually about five months past time to sign somebody). Lucas Patrick was the one weak link on an otherwise solid offensive line effort. He got beaten badly on the first drive to allow Byron Young a shot at Burrow. Ford had his rough moments with the second team. Jalen Rivers, the fifth-round pick out of Miami in the swing tackle rotation, also had a rough night, allowing a sack (disallowed by penalty) and other pressures. If a regular-season game were being played on Sunday, Ford would likely be the best option at swing tackle. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s probably time to start working him out there more and giving Rivers those reps in at guard, which were discussed last week. The current setup was uninspiring.\n\nShemar Stewart. The narrative flip continues. Stewart showed up screaming off the edge in his NFL debut, getting a tackle for loss and a couple of pressures that either flushed the quarterback or sped up his clock. Those are the types of plays the staff expects to see from a first-round pick playing against second-teamers, but it doesn\u2019t diminish the milepost.\n\nDefensive coordinator Al Golden deployed Stewart inside on an early third-and-5 with the first-team defense. Joseph Ossai and Myles Murphy were lined up outside with Kris Jenkins at the three technique. This was proof of Golden\u2019s plan to have Stewart\u2019s versatility, which he has been raving about, be part of a third-down rush package.\n\nWhat made me think about this is how long Golden will wait to shift Stewart into the starting defensive end role? Does that come in practice this week and in the second game at Washington? I have to think he\u2019s done enough to get a promotion. If that occurs, does he take the place of Ossai or Murphy? That point will end up moot once Trey Hendrickson returns.",

  "summary": "The Bengals lost their first preseason game, 34-27 to Philadelphia, extending their seven-game winless streak to seven. Despite a strong performance from Joe Burrow, the team's defense and special teams struggled, with the Bengals scoring 27 points. Head coach Zac Taylor acknowledged the mistakes made by the team as a team effort. The loss was further exacerbated by several procedural penalties, an offside penalty, and a long punt return. Dylan Fairchild, a third-round pick from the Bengals, was one of the standout performers in the game, with his blocks and playmaking ability. Tanner Hudson's performance was also noted, but the loss was not without criticism.",

      "text": "Joe Burrow dropped back to pass more times in Thursday\u2019s preseason opener in Philadelphia than he had in his entire preseason career. He did so to avoid the early-season struggles that have marred season after season.\nAfter two consecutive touchdown drives in Philadelphia, he looked more than ready to leave the preseason portion of the program behind him.\nAdvertisement\nBurrow connected on 9 of 10 passes for 123 yards and two touchdowns against the Eagles\u2019 backups.\nHe checked every box you could want to see in the process. Burrow hit Ja\u2019Marr Chase on a patented back-shoulder ball down the sideline. He converted a third down with a perfectly placed ball to Tee Higgins. He processed the field to sling a checkdown to Chase Brown, who broke a tackle for a long gain. He even scrambled to buy time to throw a touchdown pass (even though that was wiped out by a penalty).\nTo top it all off, he stood in the face of an unblocked blitzing linebacker to take a hit and deliver a strike to Chase, who turned and galloped for a 36-yard touchdown reception.\nFirst 9 \u27a1\ufe0f 1 TD hits different #CINvsPHI on Bengals Preseason TV Network pic.twitter.com/8S6KJyiznp\n\u2014 Cincinnati Bengals (@Bengals) August 8, 2025\nThat play \u2014 and the midseason form illustrated in the process \u2014 might have been exactly what Burrow had in mind. It\u2019s hard to draw up an expanded preseason appearance much better than that.\n\u201cThat\u2019s our identity,\u201d director of player personnel Duke Tobin said on the team broadcast. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are all about.\u201d\nBurrow was more muted in his evaluation after the game, calling his performance \u201caverage.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t like anything,\u201d he said. \u201cFor myself, I could have been better. I missed the first throw. I put all the other ones where I wanted to put them. I would have liked to have spun it a little better, consistently, today, but we scored two touchdowns, so go learn from a couple reps and get better.\u201d\nThis marked the first extended preseason action of Burrow\u2019s career. In a 2021 game coming off his torn ACL, Burrow took three snaps and fired just one pass \u2014 a quick wide receiver screen. Coming off a wrist injury last year, he played one series in a preseason game against Tampa Bay that included seven passes and a touchdown pass to Higgins. Burrow only held the ball for more than 2.4 seconds on one of those passes.\nAdvertisement\nOn Thursday, he largely processed and unloaded before pressure came near, but did make two throws longer than 18 air yards that required him to hold the ball, plus the final touchdown throw with Jeremiah Trotter Jr. running into his face.\nParticipating in the preseason to this extent has long been a desire for the franchise quarterback, but he\u2019s consistently battled ailments in August. Now fully healthy for the first time in the preseason, he got his wish.\nBurrow hopes that feeling the rush and gaining real reps working the pocket will help lessen the impact of opening-week clunkers that contributed to the team\u2019s slow starts. The Bengals are 1-9 in the first two games of the season since selecting Burrow in 2020. His health was consistently a large part of the problem in those losses.\nWhat did Burrow take from Thursday\u2019s game?\n\u201cJust good to play football again,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more reps you get at it, the better you are going to be at it. We got 15 reps tonight. So we are 15 reps better.\u201d\nStat | Weeks 1-2 | Weeks 3-18 |\n|---|---|---|\nEPA/dropback | -0.10 (36th) | 0.12 (5th) |\nPasser rating | 81.9 (32nd) | 104.5 (2nd) |\nCompletion % | 63.4% (27th) | 69.5% (1st) |\nTD-INT ratio | 1.6-1 (29th) | 3.4-1 (4th) |\nRecord | 1-9 | 37-21-1 |\nCincinnati head coach Zac Taylor stated this week that he expected Burrow and the starters to play longer in their Aug. 18 game at Washington on Monday Night Football. He also opened the door to adjust depending on what transpired. It\u2019s fair to wonder if the effectiveness of his performance in Philadelphia alters that plan slightly.\nAll starters are expected to rest in the preseason finale against Indianapolis.\nThe Bengals open the season at Cleveland on Sept. 7, then play at home against Jacksonville in Week 2 on Sept. 14.\n(Photo: Eric Hartline / Imagn Images)"
