      "text": "You simply will not guess the main character of the Psychonauts studio and Brutal Legend art director's new mind-bending adventure\nA lighthouse... you play as a damn cute lighthouse\nDouble Fine Productions just announced its first game in four years: Keeper, which is about a walking lighthouse, because of course it is.\nThe Psychonauts studio has been quiet for a while, but it just reared both of its heads at the Xbox Game Showcase 2025 to reveal a third-person adventure game that's intentionally hard to categorize. There are some puzzles, some exploration, lots of mind-bending sights, and, gosh darn, how did they make a lighthouse cute!?\nThe setup is that a stray bird causes a really old lighthouse to crumble down. Then, somehow, the lighthouse stands using ingrown roots as its feet, pat-pat-pattering across a fantastical world while trying not to topple over again. You can help it along its way when Keeper comes to Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Game Pass on October 17, 2025.\nDouble Fine has multiple projects in development right now, and this one's led by Lee Petty, who was previously the art director on the metal open world Brutal Legend and the main game director of Rad, Headhunter, and Stacking. Petty made Keeper with a slightly different approach, though.\n\"When it came time to work on a new project, Lee was keen to start from a place that could not be so simply categorized by its genre, defined by its mechanics, or summarized by its setting,\" an Xbox Wire blog explains. \"Instead, he wanted to explore the blurring of genres and to create room for something more atmospheric \u2013 a space for the player to really live inside, and take in the vibes.\"\nKeeper apparently spawned from the isolation Petty felt during the pandemic, around the time that Double Fine was wrapping up its last game, Psychonauts 2.\nFor now, check out the full Summer Game Fest schedule so you don't miss a single thing.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nKaan freelances for various websites including Rock Paper Shotgun, Eurogamer, and this one, Gamesradar. He particularly enjoys writing about spooky indies, throwback RPGs, and anything that's vaguely silly. Also has an English Literature and Film Studies degree that he'll soon forget.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

We look forward to welcoming you to the Bandai Namco booth which will be located in Hall 6, booth A20.\nTowa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree will invite players to defend Shinju Village against the evil Magatsu and his minions , in a 2D isometric roguelite set to launch on 19 September 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and PC. Choose two Guardians, with each mastering their own abilities, and venture on quests in a vibrant world crafted with a beautiful hand-drawn style reminiscing of Japanese ink painting.\nLittle Nightmares III lifts the curtain on a new playable demo of this upcoming atmospheric adventure game. Players will step for the first time into the Carnevale, discovering that what should be a festival of fun and childlike wonder, is yet another grim place filled with danger and disturbing residents.

      "text": "Upcoming PS5 games: New PS5 games for 2025 and beyond\nWith so many upcoming PS5 games to keep track of in August and beyond, this list does the remembering for you\nWe have lots of upcoming PS5 games to look forward to in the months ahead. In fact, August is set to bring us a ton of exciting titles, such as Gears of War: Reloaded and a new Mafia game. However, don't be fooled, 2025 is a massive year for gaming in general. There are still plenty of new PS5 games to keep track of, from PS5 exclusives to big third-party games, as we officially pass the halfway mark of the year.\nSure, our list of the best games of 2025 is already stacked with the likes of Monster Hunter Wilds and Split Fiction, but following a slew of announcements (thanks to the likes of the State of Play June showcase and Summer Game Fest Live 2025), Sony fans are being fed each and every month. We still have the likes of Ghost of Yotei to look forward to, a ton of upcoming indie games, and a Borderlands sequel on its way. That's not even mentioning long-awaited PS5 releases of hit PC and Xbox games such as Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, now confirmed to be heading to our Sony consoles as well.\nThere's a lot to remember, so to help you keep track of everything, we've created a helpful roundup of all the new games for 2025 and beyond set to come to the platform. Read on below to see all the upcoming PS5 games on the way, listed in release date order for easy browsing.\nUpcoming PS5 games to watch out for\n2025\nMafia: The Old Country\nDeveloper: Hangar 13\nPublisher: 2K\nRelease date: August 8, 2025\nMafia: The Old Country was announced during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024, and we couldn't be more excited about it. Set during 1900s Sicily, the new game is based on Mafia's origins and is taking the series back to its roots. Recently, we got a new trailer for this one as well as a shiny new release date. We'll keep you posted as more details head our way. Until then, at least we can rest easy knowing that we\u2019ll be exploring the town of San Celeste once again in August this year.\nSenua's Saga: Hellblade 2\nDeveloper: Ninja Theory\nPublisher: Xbox Game Studios\nRelease date: August 12, 2025\nOriginally released as a console exclusive on Xbox Series X, developer Ninja Theory announced Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is getting optimized in an enhanced edition with new features for PS5 and PS5 Pro. As the sequel to Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice which released in 2017, Hellblade 2 is a dark adventure steeped in myth that you find out more about in our glowing Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 review.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nMadden NFL 26\nDeveloper: EA Orlando\nPublisher: EA Sports\nRelease date: August 14, 2025\nMadden NFL 26 is the follow up to the best sports game of 2024, Madden NFL 25. Based on the National Football League, it's up to players to take their teams to victory, through smart plays and strategic decisions. What we are most excited about for this upcoming PS5 game are the improvements that have reportedly been made to the Franchise mode. Draft logic, team needs logic and sim stats have all been retooled. Hopefully the changes are great ones and we get another hit on our hands!\nSword of the Sea\nDeveloper: Giant Squid\nPublisher: Giant Squid\nRelease date: August 19, 2025\nEver wondered whether Journey would be massively improved with a sword? Well, that's what Sword of the Sea looks to be offering. Developed alongside former Thatgamecompany artist, who helped shape the iconic look of indies like Flow, Flower, and Journey, this beautiful indie looks set to put a focus on exploration and free-flowing navigation, with your armament used not only for defense but hyperkinetic sand-surfing too. Sword of the Sea honestly looks like a real delight, and one we can't wait to see more of.\nDiscounty\nDeveloper: Crinkle Cut Games\nPublisher: PQube\nRelease date: August 21, 2025\nLet's be honest most cozy games follow the premise of a character moving to the countryside and leaving the big corporate lifestyle behind. Unless you choose the Joja Mart path in Stardew Valley (you monsters) this is a genre that has you fighting gentrification. However, Discounty turns everything on its head, letting you be the \"bad guy\". Run your own discount supermarket, make deals, expand, and see how the community reacts when no one can compete with your low prices.\nGears of War: Reloaded\nDeveloper: The Coalition\nPublisher: Xbox Game Studios\nRelease date: August 26, 2025\nGears of War: Reloaded is a remaster of the original Gears of War game, and shockingly, it's coming to PS5! We say \"shocking\" because the Gears franchise is historically an Xbox-only affair, given the fact that the games are published by Xbox Game Studios. So, yeah, Gears of War: Reloaded being on our list of upcoming PS5 games is a very big deal and means that you\u2019ll be able to experience one of the best shooters of all time on your console of choice. Sign us up!\nMetal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater Remake\nDeveloper: In-house\nPublisher: Konami\nRelease date: August 28, 2025\nIt's been almost 20 years since the release of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater and its legend has only spiraled out of control in that time. Thankfully, Konami is working to introduce one of the best PS2 games to a whole new generation of players with a Metal Gear Solid 3 remake for PS5. While we're yet to get any concrete details apart from trailers on the expected changes or a look at any real-time gameplay, we are keen to see what steps Konami will take to modernize this exceptionally important (and extraordinary) stealth-action game.\nShinobi: Art of Vengeance\nDeveloper: SEGA\nPublisher: SEGA\nRelease date: August 28, 2025\nOne of the most surprising and exciting new PS5 games announced during the February State of Play showcase was the upcoming 2D action platformer, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance. Created by the team behind Streets of Rage 4, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is packed with style. From the clips and trailers we've seen so far, there's stunning art, and snappy gameplay, that every Hollow Knight fan will enjoy. You'll get to play the role of the ninja Shinobi Joe Musashi who, after finding is home destroyed, embarks on a quest for vengeance. With multiple environments and puzzles to solve along the way, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance has plenty to offer to keep you busy this August.\nLost Soul Aside\nDeveloper: Ultizero Games\nPublisher: Sony\nRelease date: August 29, 2025\nLost Soul Aside is a new, original action RPG from Shanghai-based studio Ultizero that sees you take on the role of protagonist Kaser as he sets out to find his sister, whose soul has been taken by beings known as the Voidrax. With big bosses to face and plenty of enemies to tackle with its action-oriented combat system complete with combos, Lost Soul Aside promises to test your reflexes!\nHirogami\nDeveloper: Bandai Namco Studios Singapore\nPublisher: Bandai Namco Entertainment\nRelease date: September 3, 2025\nHirogami is a stunning new PS5 game on the way in 2025, and it's one of the most unique and strangely peaceful adventure experiences yet. Exploring a vast, paper-folded world as protagonist Hiro, you'll be able to turn into various new creations \u2013 like foxes or frogs, for example \u2013 to help navigate your surroundings. Hirogami looks bursting with colorful vistas, intricate traversal puzzles, and plenty of hostile enemies as Hiro fights back against \"deadly digital invaders\", according to the game's Steam page, and we only have to wait a few months for its September release.\nHell is Us\nDeveloper: Rogue Factor\nPublisher: Nacon\nRelease date: September 4, 2025\nHell is Us is an upcoming adventure game set in a war torn country that also happens to be packed with supernatural creatures. Exploration is at the heart of the new PS5 game, but there is also plenty of combat on offer to keep action fans entertained as well. We're super intrigued about the world on display in Hell is Us. It looks pretty original, and we are curious about the underlying story behind the setting, and faceless white monsters. Hopefully, we hear more news on Hell is Us soon!\nEverybody's Golf: Hot Shots\nDeveloper: HYDE, Inc.\nPublisher: Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc.\nRelease date: September 4, 2025\nGolfing makes for some of the best sports games around, so of course, we are excited about Everybody's Golf: Hot Shots. Aim, time your shots right, and watch as golf balls fly after your club hits them with a satisfying \"clunk\". This upcoming PS5 game is also one that offers both solo and multiplayer options, allowing up to four players on local co-op as well as online options.

The extraction shooter recently opened its doors for a second test, and has been steadily building momentum since \u2013 because, spoiler alert, it seems really good. Arc Raiders is currently the eighth most wishlisted game on Steam, and with just a few months to go until its long-awaited PS5 launch, it really does feel like if anything can crack the highly competitive shooter genre, it's going to be Embark Studios.\nMina The Hollower\nDeveloper: Yacht Club Games\nPublisher: Yacht Club Games\nRelease date: October 31, 2025\nThe developer of Shovel Knight returns with this upcoming PS game, and once again, they can't resist striking the earth! Yet what Shovel Knight did for 2D side-on platformers, Mina the Hollower, centering on a whip-wielding rodent, does for top-down Game Boy-style adventures like The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. Playing with conventions, the gameplay changes up now and then to have some more action-heavy set-pieces. But for the most part, Mina will be questing whip in hand through dungeon environments. The big twist, of course, is her abilities as Hollower \u2013 she can burrow into the ground to pop up elsewhere!\nVampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2\nDeveloper: The Chinese Room\nPublisher: Paradox Interactive\nRelease date: October 2025\nLooking for a game with a bit of extra bite? Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 puts you in the seedy underbelly of Seattle, which should suit you just fine as a vampire ready to test out your new fangs. Turned as an act of vampire terrorism during the 'Mass Embrace', you'll soon get caught up in vampire faction politics, where you're still just trying to deal with your new way of life. This is an RPG at its core, too, filled with player choices, a strong narrative, and branching dialogue options.\nCairn\nDeveloper: The Game Bakers\nPublisher: The Game Bakers\nRelease date: November 5, 2025\nSpeaking of high, climbing adventure, Cairn finally has a release date of November 5. This has been one to watch since The Game Bakers \u2013 the developer behind Furi \u2013 revealed it last year. When we last caught up with the studio in January, Cairn was described as \"our most challenging production in terms of development complexity,\" \u2013 and if you've got an issue with heights, it might be just as tough to play.\nInazuma Eleven: Victory Road\nDeveloper: LEVEL5 Inc.\nPublisher: LEVEL5 Inc.\nRelease date: November 13, 2025\nAlthough this upcoming RPG and sports game was initially scheduled to be with us in August, we're still super excited to get our hands on this one despite the delays. Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road is LEVEL5 Inc.'s next entry to the famed football RPG that will have you taking on the role of a high school student named Destin Billows.

You can choose to recruit a party from a pool of 30 characters and must work to rebuild your home village.

Scheduled to release sometime this year, Code Violet is a third-person action horror title that follows the story of Violet Sinclair (a woman forced into the 25th Century to take part in expanding the human colony known as Aion) as she works to uncover the mysteries of the Aion Bioengineering Complex. The story is truly an existential nightmare from everything we hear, and personally, we can't wait to see what creatures and terrors await us when this one launches.\nMoonlighter 2: The Endless Vault\nDeveloper: Digital Sun\nPublisher: 11 bit studios\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nIf you love cute RPGs then you're probably just as excited as we are that Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault will be heading to PS5 sometime this year. The upcoming game is a sequel to the 2018 action role-playing Moonlighter, and sees you having to run your own little shop. However, in order to get things to sell you'll need to brave dangerous levels, weaving in roguelike mechanics to your otherwise cozy RPG life.

The announcement trailer seen during the PlayStation Showcase 2023 is peppered with nods to the arcade stylings of the 1994 original, this time in sleek, hyper-pigmented 4K graphics to introduce Marathon to a new generation. And with more gameplay shown since, it's good to see Bungie giving some love to other IPs aside from Destiny 2 and Halo.\nMixtape\nDeveloper: Beethoven and Dinosaur\nPublisher: Annapurna Interactive\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nMixtape looks like the kind of game that makes you all shades of nostalgic. Inspired by coming-of-age movies and set against a backdrop of endless, lazy summers, this upcoming PS5 game has you \"re-living the teenage riot before school's out forever\". It's due out later in 2025, and even without a firm release date, I'm already getting a little bit teary eyed thinking about Annapurna's latest.\nDarwin's Paradox\nDeveloper: ZDT Studios\nPublisher: Konami\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nDarwin's Paradox see's you take on the role of a blue octopus who gets pulled out of the sea and throw into an adventure full of mystery and danger in a questionable food factory. Set to make the most of the DualSense controller, the PS5 launch will feature sound effects from the controller for squeaking rats and alarms, and haptic feedback on the triggers when you're firing out ink. Yes, since the protagonist Darwin is an octopus, you can put all your tentacle skills to good use, from climbing, to cloaking yourself in ink, and more.\nCrimson Desert\nDeveloper: Pearl Abyss\nPublisher: Pearl Abyss\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nFrom the developers of Black Desert Online, Crimson Desert is an upcoming open world game that is packed with medieval action. Set on the war-torn continent of Pywel, players will take on the mercenary Macduff as they explore various settlements, take down massive bosses, and encounter mythical beasts on their journey. All the trailers and teasers that we've seen for Crimson Desert look fantastic, and we can't wait to get our hands on it.\nEverywhere\nDeveloper: In-house\nPublisher: Build a Rocket Boy\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nEverywhere is the new upcoming \"multi-world\" game first revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live. Developed by Build a Rocket Boy with former Rockstar president Leslie Benzie on the project, we got a very early look at the project, which, according to the official site, \"seamlessly blends gameplay, adventure, creativity and discovery in an all-new multi-world gaming experience\", that's claims to redefine \"how players connect with one another and with the digital world around them.\" Since the initial reveal was shrouded in mystery, no platforms were announced, but we assume it's set to come to PS5.\nHela\nDeveloper: Windup\nPublisher: Knights Peak\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nHela is a new 3D adventure from a team of developers that previously brought us Unravel. Set in a beautiful nature world inspired by Scandinavian landscapes, you take on the role of a mouse who's the little familiar of a witch in need of aid. As you set out into the big wide world, you'll gather ingredients and brew magical potions to help her.

We first caught wind of it at Summer Game Fest 2023, and the announcement trailer is suitably chaotic. From the spray of bullets raining down on legions of the undead to decidedly out-of-tune rendition of You Give Love a Bad Name underscoring it all, this is one horde FPS game worth keeping an eye on as we await a more concrete release date.\nJudas\nDeveloper: Ghost Story Games\nPublisher: Ghost Story Games\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nBioShock creator Ken Levine has finally revealed his new project - Judas. With seriously strong BioShock vibes, Judas is a single-player narrative title where you must try to escape a disintegrating starship. You must survive by either making or breaking alliances with the other people on the ship, your so-called worst enemies. You're playing as the titular Judas, who is described as \"mysterious and troubled\", and seemingly has powers in her left hand that she can switch out - again very Bioshock in space vibes all round.\nLittle Devil Inside\nDeveloper: Neostream Interactive\nPublisher: Neostream Interactive\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nLittle Devil Inside first began life on Kickstarter back in 2015. Fast forward five years later, and we see a debut trailer during the PS5 reveal stream with the news that it will be a timed exclusive. As an RPG with survival elements, Little Devil Inside is set in the \"Victorian-like\" era in a semi-open world. The trailer showed off a whole host of monsters and also gave us brief glimpses of some of the combat elements and features. It was easily one of the biggest surprises of the recent showcase.\nNo Rest for the Wicked\nDeveloper: Moon Studios\nPublisher: Private Division\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nNo Rest for the Wicked from Ori and the Blind Forest and Will of the Wisps developer Moon Studios is a new action RPG set in the year 841.

The diablo-esque experience features different character builds to play around with, along with an online co-op mode that will allow you to play with up to three friends.\nMortal Kombat Legacy Kollection\nDeveloper: Digital Eclipse\nPublisher: Atari\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nA restoration of Mortal Kombat's earliest days, Mortal Kombat Legacy edition bundles together the fighting game series' launches between 1992 and 2003. That includes the first four Mortal Kombat games along with the GBA's Mortal Kombat Advance, Deadly Alliance, and Tournament Edition.

While we'll be returning to Raccoon City, it looks thoroughly destroyed from the last time we were there: a giant crater dominates its horizon, while the city's iconic police station lies in ruins. The protagonist seems to be FBI agent Grace Ashcroft, whose past is tied heavily to the Remnant Hotel \u2013 perhaps a little too heavily, given we soon see her tied to a gurney and seemingly fighting for her life to escape. But the most exciting news of all is that Resident Evil Requiem will be launching on February 27, 2026, meaning there's not long to wait at all.\nTides of Tomorrow\nDeveloper: DigixArt\nPublisher: Deep Silver\nRelease date: Feb 24, 2026\nThe next game from Road 96 developer DigixArt, Tides of Tomorrow, is a choose-your-own-adventure-style adventure with a twist. Rather than leaving players to deal with their own decisions (see: terrible mistakes), Tides of Tomorrow syncs you up with other players \u2013 be they pals or streamers \u2013 and changes your story based on who you choose to follow. It's an interesting premise, so anyone looking for something genuinely fresh in the multiplayer scene should keep an eye out for more on this.\nGTA 6\nDeveloper: In-hoise\nPublisher: Rockstar Games\nRelease date: May 26, 2026\nRockstar Games has confirmed that GTA 6 is coming to PS5 in 2025.

The upcoming PS5 game will have you taking on the role of Elliot and his trusty fairy sidekick as you are tasked with exploring a mysterious set of ruins that's been found in the wilds. The combat looks very fun from what we've seen from the trailer already, so we have high hopes that this will be a 2026 standout.\nDirective 8020\nDeveloper: Supermassive Games\nPublisher: Supermassive Games\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nUntil Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, and The Quarry developer Supermassive Games has another horror game in the works. However, this time we'll be flung into a sci-fi nightmare with a story reminiscent of classic horror movies like The Thing and Alien. In this new PS5 game, a crew wakes up from Stasis unexpectedly, only to find that their ship has been invaded by a dangerous alien that can mimic its prey. Like all other Supermassive Games experiences, the main objective is survival here, and we can't wait to see more of the title's gameplay. Originally, the game was set to release in October 2025; however, it's now been pushed to 2026. We're still waiting on a new release date, so keep your eyes peeled on this page!\nThe Blood of Dawnwalker\nDeveloper: Rebel Wolves\nPublisher: Bandai Namco Entertainment\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nDeveloped by Rebel Wolves, a new studio founded by The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, The Blood of Dawnwalker is a goth gamer's dream. It's a moody vampire RPG where you'll have to race against the clock and the sweet allure of power in order to save your family within the game's 30-day and 30-night timeframe. So far, we've only seen a cinematic trailer and a small glimpse of gameplay for this title, but everything looks fantastic so far. Fingers crossed that we have a new hit on our hands!\nPlanet of Lana 2: Children of the Leaf\nDeveloper: Wishfully\nPublisher: Thunderful Publishing\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nWishfully is set to bring us a sequel to its atmospheric cinematic adventure that released back in 2023 (check out our Planet of Lana review for more on that) with Planet of Lana 2: Children of the Leaf. With the planet not saved from strange robots that invaded the world, we'll be reuniting with protagonist Lana and her little cat-like companion Mui as they set out to uncover the world's mysterious past. From venturing through ruins to solving puzzles, and much more, the sequel promises to more challenges and a longer, deeper story.\nMortal Shell 2\nDeveloper: Cold Symmetry\nPublisher: Playstack\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nThe first Mortal Shell was pretty gnarly and goopy, a unique take on the soulslike genre that was all about butting heads with strange foes by using equally as strange powers \u2013 including hardening \u2013 switching powers to match the threat. Mortal Shell 2 dares to ask: what if things were even more metal? And there were guns? With an introductory metal song by Ben Sahar, performed by Behemoth, this is like they injected Doom straight into the original game, all flames and fury as you tear about the oddest beasts you could imagine.\nBeast of Reincarnation\nDeveloper: Game Freak\nPublisher: Fictions\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nFrom the minds that brought us Pok\u00e9mon, this new PS5 game will have us chasing a very different kind of monster. In Beast of Reincarnation, you'll play as Emma the Sealer in the year 4026. You must pursue the titular beast, which seems to be causing nature to run rampant in ways that are somewhat destructive. The game was revealed during the Xbox Games Showcase at Summer Game Fest 2025 and looks visually breathtaking. With clashing blades, a wolf companion, and a stunning world to explore, there's a lot to look forward to here.\nCode Vein 2\nDeveloper: Bandai Namco Entertainment\nPublisher: Bandai Namco Entertainment\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nThought Bloodborne was the only soulslike to load up on vampires and weird blood powers? Think again. The underrated Code Vein took a weightier, meatier, and distinctly gothic anime approach to the format. This direct sequel from Bandai Namco dials things up by adding timey elements to the mix, and even more over-the-top powers. Crunchy, weighty attacks that see your main characters transform mid-combat seem to be taking cues from the Scarlet Nexus \u2013 their more recent release \u2013 so we can expect Code Vein 2 to embrace quicker, more combo-heavy brawls while evolving the unique tone of the original.\nEnd of Abyss\nDeveloper: Section 9\nPublisher: Epic Games\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nSection 9 is bringing a spooky new isometric shooter in 2026. With goopy monsters serving a taste of The Last of Us alongside some creepy-cute animations circa Little Nightmares, End of Abyss looks like a survival horror nightmare with a sci-fi kick. The story is a little hazy at this stage aside from featuring a lot of bullets, gore, and deep space horror, but judging from the reveal trailer, this will be one for the classic survival horror fans to dig their teeth into.\nOnimusha: Way of the Sword\nDeveloper: Capcom\nPublisher: Capcom\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nIt's been years since we've had a brand new Onimusha that isn't a remaster or a VR outing. So, you can imagine our excitement when Onimusha: Way of the Sword was announced during the 2024 Game Awards. Set to release sometime in 2026, Onimusha: Way of the Sword follows the story of a samurai who wields a mysterious artifact known as the Oni Gauntlet. It's up to you to use this strange object to defeat monsters from another world called Genma. The cation will be set in Edo-era Kyoto and promises to sport plenty of dark fantasy elements. So far, the trailer looks incredible. We can't wait to learn more about this one in the future!\nSaros\nDeveloper: Housemarque\nPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nReturnal developer Housemarque returns with a new PS5 game, Saros. To clarify, this isn't a sequel to Returnal. However, it does \"build on Returnal's award-winning third-person action,\" according to the game\u2019s creative director, Gregory Louden. From the cinematic trailer that we've seen so far, Saros will follow Arjun Devraj (portrayed by Rahul Kohli), who is forced to relive the last days of a planet he is continuously fighting for his life. The game is set to release sometime in 2026, and to be honest, it looks fantastic. We'll be keeping a close eye on this one, folks!\nStarseeker: Astroneer Expeditions\nDeveloper: System Era Softworks\nPublisher: Devolver Digital\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nOk, let's get this out of the way first, Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions is not Astroneer 2 or a sequel of any kind. Instead, this upcoming PS5 game is a new entry in the series set in the Astroneer universe. Players will have to work together here to complete planet-wide objectives across tons of different star systems. Embark on expeditions, discover vibrant worlds and their features, face dangerous creatures, and see how your ever-evolving space station changes with each upgrade. Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions currently has no release date, but we do know that it has its sights set on a 2026 launch.\nMARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra\nDeveloper: Skydance New Media\nPublisher: Plaion\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nOut of all the upcoming Marvel games on the horizon, we are most excited about MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra. So far, we've only seen a cinematic story trailer for this new PS5 game, showing off Black Panther and Captain America facing each other in a war-torn occupied Paris during WW2. The teaser is thrilling, so already we are hooked! While we are still waiting for a firm release date on this one, we do know that it's set to come out sometime in 2026. So, stay tuned for updates!\nPragmata\nDeveloper: Capcom\nPublisher: Capcom\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nCapcom revealed a mysterious new game called Pragmata that leaves more questions than it answers, but certainly piqued a lot of interest when it was added to the upcoming PS5 games list. Described as a \"thought-provoking game\", the trailer shows someone in what looks like a space suit in a futuristic setting, where they encounter a young girl called Diana and a holo-cat. While it's only coming in 2026, we're certainly eager to learn more about this rather enigmatic adventure.\nNioh 3\nDeveloper: Team Ninja\nPublisher: Koei Tecmo\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nWith Nioh 2, Team Ninja really left their own mark on the soulslike genre \u2013 combining tricky clashes with powerful yokai with the ability to turn the tides with your own demonic powers. Nioh 3, however, looks to be going beyond a straight sequel, embracing the improvements Team Ninja made to their own formula with Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, which imagined a supernatural world set in Chinese history that was their own riff on what FromSoftware accomplished with Sekiro. Here, it comes full circle, as Nioh 3 incorporating the greater mobility and exploration introduced in Wo Long into the world of Nioh 3.\n007 First Light\nDeveloper: IO Interactive\nPublisher: IO Interactive\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nIO Interactive is gearing up to tell the origin story for James Bond in a brand new game originally titled Project 007 before getting the fresh name of 007 First Light. Although details are scarce, we recently got a new trailer during the last State of Play showcase that showed off some gameplay. We also know is that it's going to be an entirely original James Bond story - so not tied to the novels or films. Hakan Abrak, CEO of IO says that it is \"the most ambitious game in the history of our studio\". Exciting times ahead.\nMarvel: TOKON Fighting Souls\nDeveloper: Arc System Works\nPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nHere's a State of Play reveal that nobody had on the cards: Arc System Works (Guilty Gear, Double Dragon) has unveiled Marvel: TOKON Fighting Souls, a 4v4 tag team fighting game set in the Marvel universe. Though there's no exact release date beyond 2026, we've already seen that the likes of Spider-Man, Doom, Ghost Rider, Storm, Captain America, and Iron Man will all be playable. It's hard to understate how big a collaboration this is, so fans of the best fighting games should absolutely keep their eyes peeled for more news on this ahead of it launching on PC and PS5.\nBloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement\nDeveloper: ArtPlay\nPublisher: 505 Games\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nCastlevania fans, this one's for you. Featuring all the 3D side-scrolling hack-n'-slash action you could wish for, Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement is an upcoming PS5 game on the way in 2026. It's already looking like everything a self respecting Victorian gothic fan could ask for: winding stone castles, dramatic flowing capes, a lady in a fancy hat sitting atop a pile of human skulls\u2026 honestly, the cool Soulsy combat is almost a mere bonus to the sheer spooky vibes the reveal trailer gives off. We'd expect nothing less from developer ArtPlay, so the new Bloodstained game is definitely one to keep an eye on in the coming months.\nSea of Remnants\nDeveloper: Joker Studio\nPublisher: NetEase Games\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nAny game introduced with its own folk song gets a pass in our books, and that goes double when pirates are involved. An adventure RPG set on the high seas, Sea of Remnants has opened pre-registration. Beyond that, we haven't heard too much about what's in store beyond ship-based battles and some sort of slot machine-wielding crab. Hopefully that last one's explained sooner rather than later, eh?\nRomeo is a Dead Man\nDeveloper: Grasshopper Manufacture\nPublisher: Grasshopper Manufacture\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nRevealed with a stylishly animated trailer, lashings of ultra violence, and a truly devil-may-care attitude, it could only be a new game from Grasshopper Manufacturer. Romeo is a Dead Man is the latest creation from Suda51, complete with hand-drawn animations, zombies, gore, and plenty of (bitten) tongue-in-cheek humor to boot. Our FBI-investigator protagonist Romeo Stargazer is as outrageous as his name in both manner and mayhem, tearing through zomboid enemies in the reveal trailer for a chaotic taste of the carnage in store.\nBlighted\nDeveloper: Drinkbox Studios\nPublisher: Drinkbox Studios\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nDescribed as a \"psychedelic western nightmare\", this Metroidvania comes from the steady hands at Drinkbox Studios \u2013 responsible for the likes of Guacamelee and Nobody Saves the World. The colorful, crunchy action takes place in a sort of isometric perspective, which reminds us of the likes of Hades. Here, however, you can play through your adventure either solo or with 3-players, making this a more sociable experience \u2013 if this is anything like the co-op fun that was in Guacamelee 2, we're in for a riotous time.\nInfinitesimals\nDeveloper: Cubit Studios\nPublisher: Epic Games Publishing\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nYou might be small, but you are at least mighty \u2013 the threats you're facing\u2026 rather mundane? When your spaceship crashes on a strange planet, you have to contend with the wildlife and strange structures that resemble a somewhat futuristic Earth. Think if Pikmin were a shooter and looked way more realistic. With your fellow alien squad scattered to the winds, it's up to brave the blades of grass and insects in your way to get them back, and find out what happened to the colony you were sent to join up with.\nTBC\nPersona 4 Revival\nDeveloper: Atlus\nPublisher: Sega\nRelease date: TBC\nAfter years of rumors and wishful thinking, Inaba is looking particularly luscious in our first look at the Persona 4 remake. Revealed during Summer Game Fest 2025, Persona 4 Revival will be giving one of the best Persona games a modern makeover for the PS5 as we follow the high schooler Yu Narukami in a high-stakes murder mystery. From the trailer, we've seen that all the original aspects that we loved about the JRPG are still seemingly in tack. However, we assume that we'll soon hear news on some tweaks and changes once a release date gets announced as well.\nAphelion\nDeveloper: DON'T NOD\nPublisher: DON'T NOD\nRelease date: TBC\nDevelopers of Life is Strange are diving into a brand new sci-fi story with the new PS5 game, Aphelion. Made in collaboration with the European Space Agency, Aphelion tells the story of a character crash landing on a strange and hostile planet, on a mission to find someone named \"Thomas\". However, don't expect a walk in the park for this journey as Aphelion is deadly and you\u2019ll be engaging in plenty of \"tense stealth gameplay\". Currently we're still waiting for a release date for this one, so stay tuned!\nSuper Meat Boy 3D\nDeveloper: Team Meat\nPublisher: Headup\nRelease date: TBC\nSuper Meat Boy is getting a fancy new 3D makeover in the upcoming PS5 game, Super Meat Boy 3D, after years of delighting us all with his 2D outings. On a mission to save his girlfriend, you'll have to guide Meat Boy through some of the most brutal and scream inducing platformer levels you'll ever face. But hey, who said love was easy, right? Currently we are still waiting on a release date for this one, however, we can all rest easy knowing that it'll be a bloody, delightful affair once it does launch.\nAtomic Heart 2\nDeveloper: Mundfish\nPublisher: Mundfish\nRelease date: TBC\nLook: managing to work the phrase \"Atomic Heart 2\" into your Atomic Heart 2 reveal trailer is a feat that's worth acknowledging. Soundtrack it to Don't Stop Me Now, and you've already got a tone that's sillier than even the first game. We've got no release window for this upcoming PS5 game, but given the trailer's only just confirming it's in development, it could be a while before we get our hands on Atomic Heart 2.\nThe Cube\nDeveloper: Mundfish\nPublisher: Mundfish\nRelease date: TBC\nAs if Atomic Heart 2's reveal at Summer Game Fest 2025 wasn't enough, Mundfish also revealed The Cube \u2013 an MMO RPG set in the same universe as Atomic Heart. The premise is as simple as it is weird: a gigantic floating cube has appeared in the sky, and scientists are racing to uncover a reality-changing equation that's hidden within. The catch? There's all sorts of sentient life on its surface, and the cube itself \u2013 so big it has its own biomes \u2013 is constantly rotating. Multiplayer shooters are hard to crack, but this one really does sound as interesting as it does strange.\nChrono Odyssey\nDeveloper: Chrono Studio\nPublisher: Kakao Games\nRelease date: TBC\nWith enough Soulslike energy and grimdark fantasy vibes to give Malenia a heartattack, Chrono Odyssey is an upcoming action-MMORPG set in a \"seamlessly designed open world\". Team up with your friends (or total strangers) to explore every inch, defeating all manner of hulking, brutish monsters in your path using time-bending powers to even the score. Freezing foes in place, levitating them\u2026 you decide.\nLego Voyagers\nDeveloper: Light Brick Studio\nPublisher: Annapurna Interactive\nRelease date: TBC\nLego Builder's Journey might be one of the best Lego games you didn't play, which is why it's great to see the devs get the chance to build on the concept of puzzley, semi-realistic Lego action. Lego Voyagers centers on two tiny single square bricks \u2013 the really narrow ones \u2013 with a single eye sticker each. They roll and click around diorama-style areas that have all the sheen you'd expect from real-life Lego bricks. To progress, they'll need to put their heads together to build paths forward, and sometimes literally as they connect to the same objects, and you have to collaborate to get the results you need. It's a great new PS5 game to keep track of!\nAssassin's Creed Hexe\nDeveloper: Ubisoft Montreal\nPublisher: Ubisoft\nRelease date: TBC\nUbisoft Montreal \u2013 the birthplace of Assassin's Creed \u2013 is working on a very different type of entry to the series. Following the release of Assassin's Creed Valhalla in 2020, the studio has been quietly working on Assassin's Creed Codename Hexe under the leadership of Watch Dogs Legion's creative director Clint Hocking. While it's thought to be in early development, an early tease suggests a far darker setting that could revolve around Europe's bloody 16th century witch trials. Sadly, there's a good chance we'll be waiting until 2025 and beyond for this one.\nCities Skylines 2\nDeveloper: Colossal Order\nPublisher: Paradox\nRelease date: TBC\nCities Skylines 2 is finally coming to console after its PC launch last year, and is the long-awaited sequel to one of the most popular city builders of all time. It's bringing with it enhanced features like better road tools, public and cargo transportation, traffic AI, massive 150 tile maps per unique city, and a cinematic camera. We'll also be able to get much closer to the action than ever before, with the opportunity to follow individual citizens from birth to death in your city.\nDune Awakening\nDeveloper: Funcom\nPublisher: Funcom\nRelease date: TBC (PC release June 10, 2025)\nFuncom is bringing us a new survival open-world MMO set in the vast landscape of the classic sci-fi setting Arrakis. Dune: Awakening is said to blend the survival game genre with a multiplayer experience as you try to live in the harsh landscapes of the planet. You'll be building shelters to weather sandstorms, looking after your stillsuit, and trying to brave the deep desertland. It'll be interesting to see how the famous setting serves as a home for an MMO experience. During Gamescom 2024, it was announced that the game is set to release in Early Access for PC players in 2025. However, we are still waiting on a PS5 release window.\nElder Scrolls 6\nDeveloper: Bethesda Game Studios\nPublisher: Bethesda\nRelease date: TBC\nAh, the Elder Scrolls 6. The 37-second trailer that blew the world's mind at E3 2018. The game that we know nothing about beyond this same trailer, that is in development somewhere within Bethesda Game Studios along with Starfield. Because it is so far away from release, you can bet your bottom coin that it's going to appear - at some point - on the PS5 (although hopefully not whatever the PS6 could be).\nFairgames\nDeveloper: Haven Studios\nPublisher: SIE\nRelease date: TBC\nHaven Studios was acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2022, becoming part of the PlayStation Studios family to help lead the PS5's expanding live service initiative. The studio's debut is Fairgames, an all-new co-op experience where you'll team up with friends to go up against the corporate overloads squeezing the life out of the world. A report surfaced in 2025 that studio lead Jade Raymond had parted ways with the project, and we're still awaiting a further update on the new multiplayer experience.\nIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet\nDeveloper: Naughty Dog\nPublisher: SIE\nRelease date: TBC\nIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is the new game from Last of Us and Uncharted developer Naughty Dog. Currently in development for PS5, the project has been in the works since 2020 and will see us take on the role of new protagonist Jordan A. Mun, a bounty hunter who ends up stranded on a distant planet that's said to have lost communication with the outside universe hundreds of years ago.\nLight No Fire\nDeveloper: Hello Games\nPublisher: Hello Games\nRelease date: TBC\nNo Man's Sky developer Hello Games is bringing us a new experience with Light No Fire - a survival sandbox adventure you can play with others. Set on an open-world fantasy planet that's described as being the same size as the Earth, you'll be given the freedom to explore its diverse biomes as you try to unravel its lore and mysteries. With building and survival aspects, we also saw in the reveal trailer that you can fly through the vistas on the back of a dragon, climb mountains, and even set sail across the oceans.\nMarvel's Wolverine\nDeveloper: Insomniac\nPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment\nRelease date: TBC\nUndoubtedly one of the biggest surprises of the PlayStation September 2021 showcase came in the shape of those famous adamantium claws belonging to none other than Wolverine. Yes, a new standalone Marvel's Wolverine game is currently in development. While we're light on details for the moment, we do know Brian Horton is Wolverine's creative director, and Cameron Christian is the game director. Horton was creative director on Spider-Man Miles Morales and has also worked on games such as Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider.\nNew Mass Effect\nDeveloper: BioWare\nPublisher: EA\nRelease date: TBC\nIt might be quite a way off release, but that isn't going to stop us being ridiculously overexcited for a brand new Mass Effect game - aka Mass Effect 5. Seemingly picking up after the events of Mass Effect 3, we'll be seeing some old faces return and some plot lines picked back up. Of course, the big question of whether Shepard will return remains, but we're ready for everything.\nNew Virtua Fighter Project\nDeveloper: Rya Ga Gotoku Studio\nPublisher: Sega\nRelease date: TBC\nVery little is known about the new Virtua Fighter Project currently in the works, but the the brief teaser trailer showed off a powerful figure in a hat who punched another man through a wall. Said to be a completely new project in the Virtua Fighter series, it's certainly one to watch out for.\nOkami sequel\nDeveloper: Capcom\nPublisher: Capcom\nRelease date: TBC\nA sequel to the beloved painterly adventure Okami is currently in the works from Capcom and game director Hideki Kamiya. With a brief teaser trailer show so far, we've only gotten of glimpse of the follow-up so far, but it looks set to bring us to another gorgeous world in the same signature style, with the promise of a heartwarming story in the same vein as the original as we once again take on the role of Amaterasu.\nPhantom Blade 0\nDeveloper: Cruel Man Studio\nPublisher: S-Game\nRelease date: TBC\nIf you're a fan of samurai swashbuckling and moody feudal Japan as a setting, Phantom Blade 0 seems to be promising us both. The third person action title is yet to have a confirmed release date, but from what we've seen at the PlayStation Showcase 2023, your character has \"66 days to live\". What will he do with it? \"Get my heart back,\" he responds. We don't know much else just yet, but its brooding color scheme and fast-paced melee combat seem like a dynamic blend of Gungrave GORE aesthetics with Ghost of Tsushima action, and we're already here for it.\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake\nDeveloper: Aspyr\nPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment and Lucasfilms Games\nRelease date: TBC\nAfter many rumors began circulating, the latest Sony showcase confirmed that a remaster of BioWare's beloved Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is on the way, and the upcoming Star Wars game is coming to PS5. Aspyr and Sony Interactive Entertainment are working with Lucasfilm Games to rebuild the classic adventure, which promises to bring KOTOR to a new generation with \"modern tech, features, visuals, and more, while maintaining the integrity of the story and characters\" so many have come to love.\nThick as Thieves\nDeveloper: OtherSide Entertainment\nPublisher: Megabit Publishing\nRelease date: TBC\nWhat happens when several thieves, each with their own special set of talents gets put on the same heist. Well, you can find out the answer to that question with the upcoming PvPvE game, Thick as Thieves. Outwit and act fast to steal treasure before any other players can get their hands on it. However, be warned, it isn't easy rising through the ranks in a 1910s metropolis that is filled with shadows and magic. Thick as Thieves looks to be tons of fun and an exciting spin to typical stealth based gameplay. Currently, we're still waiting for a release date for it, so stay tuned for updates.\nLumines Arise\nDeveloper: Enhance, Monstars\nPublisher: TBC\nRelease date: TBC\nWhere do you go from a game as sublime as Tetris Effect? Switch gears, and apply the same Enhance transcendental puzzling action to another franchise entirely with Lumines Arise. Promising to take us away to yet another synesthetic sensory wonderland, reviving the PSP classic Lumines: Puzzle Fusion from Q Entertainment. Like Tetris, it's all about falling blocks, except here you have to nudge them into 2x2 grids and match colors to get them to pop. The must-have portable puzzler drew comparisons to Tetris with its original release, so it's the perfect successor for the Tetris Effect developers to have some more fun.\nILL\nDeveloper: Team Cloud\nPublisher: Mundfish Powerhouse\nRelease date: TBC\nPerhaps the gnarliest game of Summer Game Fest 2025, Ill has resurfaced after several years of cooking from developer Team Cloud. It comes with good news for horror fans: it looks gnarlier than ever, with its creature design leaning into body horror with zombified babies and \u2013 for lack of a better term \u2013 inside-out people. There was also a huge emphasis on reactivity to gunshots \u2013 shoot a humanoid in the leg, and it stumbles down for an execution. This has been on indie horror fans' radars for years, but fingers crossed it's inching toward a release date now that it's under the wing of Atomic Heart developer Mundfish's new creative label.\nFor more future releases coming to other platforms, head over to our lists for all the upcoming PC games, upcoming Switch 2 games, and upcoming Switch games.\nSam Loveridge is the Brand Director and former Global Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar.

      "text": "Upcoming PC games: New PC games for 2025 and beyond\nAll the latest upcoming PC games on the way this year and next, from Octopath Traveler 0 to Borderlands 4\nIt's August, and thanks to these upcoming PC games, the last weeks of Summer are set to be thrilling ones. It's been a jam-packed 2025 already, with Grounded 2, Killing Floor 3, and Tales of the Shire having launched in the last month alone.\nIf you're like me, though, there's no such thing as too many new games, which is where this list comes in. This list compiles all of the new PC games still to come this year, from some seriously gnarly upcoming horror games (including Dying Light: The Beast, which was recently delayed to September), to some very important upcoming RPGs. We even have a remaster of the original Gears of War to keep an eye out for in the coming weeks, as well as a new Kirby adventure, the long-awaited Mafia prequel, and a host of gorgeous upcoming indie games to choose from. Octopath Traveler 0 is also on the way, following a stunning reveal at July's Nintendo Direct, meaning fans of the best JRPGs are in for a truly magical winter. We also got a first glimpse at Once Upon a Katamari, too, which is scheduled to launch in just a few short weeks.\nWith everything in release date order, you'll have a Steam wishlist crammed with upcoming PC games in no time. Ready to dive in? Let's start with this month's offerings...\nAll the new PC games to keep an eye on\n2025\nMafia: The Old Country\nDeveloper: Hangar 13\nRelease date: August 8, 2025\nThe Mafia games are iconic, so of course we're excited that a new title in the series is coming to PC in 2025. Mafia: The Old Country is a prequel that will take players to the streets of 1900s Sicily. You'll take on the role of Enzo Favara and will have to prove your worth as you try to navigate (and survive) the underworld of one of the most unforgiving periods of criminal history.\nSword of the Sea\nDeveloper: Giant Squid\nRelease date: August 19, 2025\nYou'd be forgiven if you thought this was Journey 2. It's close, and made by some of the same people. Sword of the Sea is brought to you by Giant Squid, which has delivered Abzu and The Pathless to date, and it sees you playing as a character called Wraith. You'll be zooming around an abandoned realm on a Hoversword (yes you read that right), exploring the Necropolis of the Gods, but also trying to avoid the leviathans that dwell there. It looks exceptionally beautiful and zen, and we can't wait to see more.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nGears of War: Reloaded\nDeveloper: The Coalition\nRelease date: August 26, 2025\nGears of War: Reloaded is a full remaster of the first game, so you'll be able to dive into the action that kickstarted the iconic Xbox series from The Coalition on PC with lots of shiny bells and whistles, including 4K resolution and 120 FPS support, along with online and split-screen co-op in the campaign, and cross-play for its returning multiplayer experience.\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater\nDeveloper: Konami\nRelease date: August 28, 2025\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the long-awaited remake of Metal Gear Solid 3. According to the developer, it's going to be a faithful story recreation but offer players evolved gameplay and visuals. While it's a pretty faithful portrayal of some of those original environments, too, you can expect some new features, including an original online multiplayer mode to get stuck into.\nHell is Us\nDeveloper: Rogue Factor\nRelease date: September 4, 2025\nThe Hell is Us trailer is wild, and it immediately caught our attention as soon as we saw it. In a world that was gripped and ruined by a mysterious calamity, you must explore what\u2019s left and face some of the wackiest-looking creatures while doing so. The semi-open world is combat-heavy, strange, and comes with no maps or compass markers, meaning that it'll be easy to get lost as well as discover wonders unexpectedly. So far, the game looks to be a surreal trip that we're personally all for taking come September time.\nBorderlands 4\nDeveloper: Gearbox Software\nRelease date: September 12, 2025\nAfter years of waiting, we finally have news that Borderlands 4 will be heading our way in September 2025, and it got moved ahead by a whole week because the devs are so confident that we'll love it. That's right, more looter shooter action is coming. This time, though, we won't be traveling around Pandora. It's been confirmed that there will be a new alien planet for us to explore in the upcoming PC game, so if you were expecting a repeat of the best Borderlands games, this is going to be a fresh experience.\nDying Light: The Beast\nDeveloper: Techland\nRelease date: September 19, 2025\nThe next Dying Light game is set to bring back Kyle Crane in all his glory, this time with surprising new powers. The Beast is one upcoming PC game I can't wait to check out this summer, a bloody hack-n-slash zombie-busting fest that is promising everything developer Techland does best: action, horror, gore, and more, this time with vehicles and firearms making a long-awaited return following Dying Light's The Following DLC from 2016. What's not to love? See you in Castor Woods soon...\nSilent Hill f\nDeveloper: NeoBards Entertainment Ltd.\nRelease date: September 25, 2025\nSilent Hill f is the next big installment in Konami's iconic series and we can't wait! Not only is this the first Silent Hill game not set in the US (taking us to 1960s Japan instead), and from its trailers, it looks horrifically stunning. You'll get the chance to play as the highschooler Hinako, whose ordinary life is turned upside down once a mysterious fog engulfs and starts changing her hometown into a literal nightmare. Silent Hill f will come our way in September.\nDigimon Story Time Stranger\nDeveloper: Media. Vision Inc.\nRelease date: October 2, 2025\nWho needs Pok\u00e9mon when we have a new Digimon game to look forward to this year? Sorry, Nintendo, but our monster-taming sights are firmly set on the upcoming PC game Digimon Story Time Stranger for now. In the upcoming JRPG, you'll have to discover the mysteries surrounding the collapse of your world, kickstarting an adventure that will send you across parallel dimensions and into different realities.\nLittle Nightmares 3\nDeveloper: Supermassive Games\nRelease date: October 10, 2025\nBandai Namco's unnerving horror-platformer series is back. We heard from Little Nightmares 3 developer Supermassive Games at Gamescom 2023, where they told us all about what it's like to spearhead the third instalment. We know the first chapter takes us through the arid plains of Necropolis, with the horrifying Monster Baby chasing down our two new protagonists, Low and Alone. LN3 will also be the first in the series to go the multiplayer route, with it being an optional game mode if you want to play the game with a friend via local couch co-op.\nLittle Nightmares Enhanced Edition\nDeveloper: Engine Software BV\nRelease date: October 10, 2025\nAlongside Little Nightmares 3, the game that started it all is getting a shiny re-release with Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition. Set to support 4K and 60FPS, you step into unsettling world of the Maw as Six for the first time, or rediscover it all again complete with Performance and Quality modes, improved visuals, and gameplay tweaks including game helpers and updated checkpoints.\nKeeper\nDeveloper: Double Fine Productions\nRelease date: October 17, 2025\nKeeper is described as a surreal third-person atmospheric adventure filled with a puzzles. Telling a tale without using words, you follow the story of a forgotten lighthouse who stands alone on a island lost at sea. When the lighthouse awakens and tendrils start to snake out of its once dormant form, you control the vertical structure as it sets with a mysterious purpose. Joined by a seabird, you'll make your way to center of the island.\nJurassic World Evolution 3\nDeveloper: Frontier Developments\nRelease date: October 21, 2025\nEveryone knows that management games run best on PC, so no doubt a ton of players will be thrilled to hear that we are getting a new Jurassic World Evolution game, with Jurassic World Evolution 3. It's up to you to make the best (and probably most daily) tourist attraction around as you unlock dinosaurs and attract guests to your prehistoric park. A ton of dinos are up for grabs here, including cute baby ones, and favorite characters also return, including Doctor Ian Malcolm (still portrayed by Jeff Goldblum).\nNinja Gaiden 4\nDevelopers: PlatinumGames Inc. / Team NINJA\nRelease date: October 21, 2025\nGrab your masks and get ready to hide in the shadows because Ninja Gaiden 4 has been announced and will be heading our way in October.

The series is iconic, and now the story is being expanded to usher in a new generation. In Ninja Gaiden 4, you'll get to play both the legendary Ryu Hayabusa and the new protagonist Yakumo. From what we've seen so far, the action looks incredible.

Wait, you've done that already?! Well, Once Upon a Katamari is promising a brand new serving of the classic snowball-style action game, and it's coming out just days away from Halloween. The latest chapter will see us venturing \"through new worlds to roll up thy heart's desires,\" restoring the stars at the behest of our sassy, stocking-clad father. I'm just as confused as you are, but it's hard not to crack a smile at an upcoming PC game with this much whimsy.\nThe Outer Worlds 2\nDeveloper: Obsidian Entertainment\nRelease date: October 29, 2025\nThe Outer Worlds 2 is bringing us to Arcadia for new adventures with a fresh colony that's said to have \"skip drive\" technology. Promising to carry on the first entry's signature sense of humor, Obsidian's follow-up will introduce a new cast of companions with their own dreams to fulfill - and we can choose whether or not we help them. Taking on the role of an \"Earth Directorate\" agent, we'll investigate dangerous rifts and be presented with choices that will let us shape our own sci-fi-shaped journey.\nArc Raiders\nDeveloper: Embark Studios\nRelease date: October 30, 2025\nArc Raiders is a new multiplayer extraction adventure that sees you take on the role of a raider in a desolate world.

Mina The Hollower is a top-down Game Boy-style kind of adventure that gives off strong The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.

For sure, one to add to your wishlists, especially if you are a fan of action-heavy titles with an adorable twist.\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2\nDeveloper: The Chinese Room\nRelease date: October 2025\nIt's been two decades since the first game, but Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines 2 is intended to launch in late 2025. The much-anticipated sequel to a cult classic RPG, Bloodlines 2, has emerged from a rocky developmental period with tons to show for it, including post-alpha gameplay, four playable vampire clans upon release, and plenty of planned DLC to boot. Bloodlines 2 is a \"neo-noir thriller\" that will see us step into the shoes of customizable main character Phyre, a recently re-awoken Elder vampire who finds themselves in the middle of a very different Boston Camarilla than they remember. As a powerful child of the night grappling with the newness of the modern world, this might just be the vampire RPG experience we've been waiting for since Troika Games' original.\nCairn\nDeveloper: The Game Bakers\nRelease date: November 5, 2025\nCairn is a new realistic climbing simulation that sees you take on the role of a pro climber called Aava. As you set out to make your way up Mount Kami, the summit of which has never been reached, you'll meet other climbers and solve problems along the way as you freely explore the mountain, journey over the rock face, and navigate your way through difficult sections.\nOctopath Traveler 0\nDeveloper: Square Enix\nRelease date: December 4, 2025\nTurn-based JRPG fans, you're in luck. Octopath Traveler 0 is officially coming this December, set to deliver a prequel to the last two games that expands its already iconic formula. You'll be in control of an eight-character party, selected from a pool of \"over 30 recruitable members\" as you embark upon yet another stunning medieval fantasy journey. This is one upcoming PC game we are very happy to count among the year's roster, and despite the series' popularity as some of the best Switch games ever, it's sure to be a heavy-hitter for PC players too.\nTBC 2025\nMarathon\nDeveloper: Bungie\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nMarathon is the revival of Bungie's shooter that was in development before Destiny. It's an extraction shooter, we guess in the vein of Escape from Tarkhov or Rainbow Six Extraction. We're already loving the art style, and with Bungie's shooting at the heart, this one is going to be one to pay attention to. It's since been pushed out of its September release date, and we're still awaiting word on when it will arrive.\nMixtape\nDeveloper: Beethoven and Dinosaur\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nIt's been years of waiting, but we finally know that Mixtape from Artful Escape developer, Beethoven and Dinosaur will be heading to PC later this year in 2025. Inspired by classic teen movies and coming-of-age stories, this new PC game is set against a backdrop of endless, lazy summers. While not much around the characters and story is known yet, we have seen clips of mall skateboarding antics, roadtrips and fireside circles. It looks like a total vibe, and we can't wait to learn more!\nHollow Knight: Silksong\nDeveloper: Team Cherry\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nTeam Cherry started out by developing DLC for Hollow Knight, one of the best Metroidvania games of the modern era, and the scope of the project quickly spiraled out of control. Now a full fledge sequel that's been years in the making, Hollow Knight: Silksong will feature all-new combat mechanics, characters, and worlds to learn and explore, and despite all these years of waiting, we're still excited to jump back in. Never fear, if there's more concrete release date news, we'll be updating as soon as we can.\nSlay the Spire 2\nDeveloper: Mega Crit\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nAs the sequel to the stellar 2019 roguelike deck-builder, Slay the Spire 2 from developer Mega Crit will see you head into a newly evolved spire where dangerous, deadly foes lurk within its labyrinth.

Metal Edan follows a Hyper Unit Aska, who are sent on a suicide mission to try and save their citizens. However, when they venture onto Moebius, an orbital city, they are met with carnage. From clips and trailers for this upcoming title, we've seen plenty of bright colors, cybernetic warfare, and fast gameplay on display. It looks like a wild, fun time and should be on your radar if you love blasting robots with guns.\nWitchbrook\nDeveloper: Chucklefish / Robotality\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nWitchbrook is new magic school life sim from Wargoove and Eastward publisher Chucklefish that's set to bring us to the cozy seaside city of Mossport.

With residents to get to know (and even develop romantic relationships with if you so choose), you can also spend your time growing your own garden, decorating your cottage, go shopping, hit the arcade, and more. Complete with four-player online co-op support, this is one adventure that promises to cast a spell over us.\nClockwork Revolution\nDeveloper: inXile\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nOne of the coolest-looking upcoming PC games is Clockwork Revolution, a steampunk action adventure that resembles BioShock Infinite. There's no official release date just yet, but what we saw at the 2023 Xbox Games Showcase gives us reason to get excited. Right now it's expected to launch sometime in 2025 or later, so watch this space...\nCrimson Desert\nDeveloper: Pearl Abyss\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nIf gritty third-person action is your vibe, you'll love Crimson Desert. This upcoming PC game sees players traversing unforgiving lands as Kliff Macduff, a lone warrior who deals with problems (and monsters) by the sword. You only need to check out our Crimson Desert preview to see how much this open-world has to offer, from combo-based combat encounters to a sprawling world to explore and conquer.\nTears of Metal\nDeveloper: Paper Cult\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nTears of Metal screams \u201cFreedom\u201d as its clans descend on the battlefield in a roguelike co-op hack n slash. The almost comic-book art style hides brutal skirmishes between legions of medieval Scottish fighters, but there\u2019s a common enemy afoot. A fiery meteor has crashed into a distant island, and our battalions are facing an oncoming invasion like no other. It\u2019s not all stabby stabby, though, the trailer gave us a first look at some interesting management and strategy mechanics that will serve each run as well. Tears of Metal is due to land in 2025 on Steam.\n2026\nResident Evil Requiem\nDeveloper: Capcom\nRelease date: February 27, 2026\nWe didn't think it would be real, but our dreams have all collectively come true because Resident Evil 9 (aka Resident Evil Requiem) was announced during the Summer Game Fest 2025 Live presentation. Come February 2026, we'll be diving back into Raccoon City, following FBI agent Grace Ashcroft, whose past is tied heavily to the Remnant Hotel \u2013 perhaps a little too heavily. There's plenty of intrigue and anticipation with this one, so our hopes are high for Capcom's latest addition to one of the best horror franchises ever made.\nTBC 2026\nDirective 8020\nDeveloper: Supermassive Games\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nWhat better way to celebrate a new year than with a new scary interactive story? That's right, Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology developer Supermassive Games has another horror game in the works. This time, we'll be flung into a sci-fi spooky take with a story reminiscent of some of the best horror movies like The Thing and Alien. In this new PC game, a crew wakes up from stasis unexpectedly, only to find that their ship has been invaded by an alien who can mimic its prey (where is Kurt Russel when you need him, right?). Like all other Supermassive Games experiences, the main objective is survival here. Originally, this was a 2025 title, but it has been delayed to 2026.\nThe Blood of Dawnwalker\nDeveloper: Rebel Wolves\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nThe Blood of Dawnwalker is an exciting new RPG from newly formed studio Rebel Wolves - which is made of former The Witcher devs. Set in 14th-century Europe, which is rife with plague and conflict, you take on the role of Coen, a half-human, half-vampire, who sets out to try and save his family.

Said to be the start of a new saga, this looks set to be one new RPG to watch out for.\nChronicles Medieval\nDeveloper: Raw Power Games\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nThe debut game from Raw Power Games, Chronicles: Medieval looks like the first game to truly bring competition to Mount and Blade's specific blend of strategy and action. A brutal war game set in medieval Europe, Chronicles: Medieval was revealed with a trailer narrated by Tom Hardy that was mostly CG, but still managed to squeeze in a shot of the player gathering together a band of troops. It's the sort of blend of big-picture strategy and moment-to-moment action that's kept PC players hooked on Total War for years \u2013 albeit with much more direct stabbing \u2013 so this one's going right on the Steam wishlist.\nBlighted\nDeveloper: Drinkbox Studios\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nMetroidvania get ready because Silksong isn't the only title heading to PC. However, this offering is only heading our way in 2026. Blighted is a \"psychedelic western nightmare\" from Drinkbox Studios that takes place in a sort of isometric perspective (think Hades). You'll get the chance to experience a colourful adventure either solo or with up to three friends. From the clips we've seen, the art is stunning, and the co-op action looks to be especially engaging.\nOut of Words\nDeveloper: WiredFly, Kong Orange\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nOut of Words is a new co-op adventure that you can play with a pal online with cross-platform support, or locally in couch co-op.

Along the way, you'll have to improve your gear and just try to stay alive in facility you'll soon find yourself trapped in.\nGame of Thrones: War for Westeros\nDeveloper: PlaySide\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nWere you annoyed with the ending of the Game of Thrones TV show, and can't wait for George RR Martin to finally finish Winds of Winter (not that we're doubting)? Game of Thrones: War for Westeros puts the power in your hands to decide what happens after winter finally comes, this RTS Strategy asking you to play strategist \u2013 \"you decide who lives, and who dies\". This is teased in the reveal trailer by showing a clash between Jon Snow and the White Walkers' Night King, having Jon win at first, then showing a version where it's reversed.\nFable 4\nDeveloper: Playground Games\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nPlayground's upcoming RPG, Fable 4, will be the fourth ever game in the series, but the very first under the new developer after Lionhead Studios folded six years after Fable 3. We'd originally thought it a long-awaited sequel, but more recent cinematic sneak peeks from Playground Games have revealed Fable to be more of a series reboot. It's still set in the glittering medieval fantasy kingdom of Albion, and still features that crass tongue-in-cheek British sense of humor we loved about the original trilogy, but the new Fable game is set to bring it into the 2020s with style.\nWax Heads\nDeveloper: Patattie Games\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nWax Heads is one of our most anticipated cozy games heading to PC and will see you take part in a narrative driven experience where you'll be running a struggling record store. Chat to your customers and discover their music tastes, curate a collection of tunes, and follow your favourite bands. Wax Heads looks like the perfect game to unwind with, and set's itself out from the cozy game pack with its punk-twist. Personally, we can't wait for this one!\nThere are No Ghosts at the Grand\nDeveloper: Friday Sundae\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nIn this charming (and very musical) upcoming PC game, you'll be in charge of restoring an English hotel back to its glory days. However, there's a spooky twist. While you renovate during the day, you'll have to catch ghosts during the night. Uncover a supernatural plot as you not only restore the hotel but the entire village as well. There are No Ghosts at the Grand looks wholly unique and like the perfect blend of story-driven action paired with decorating and combat features.\nBeast of Reincarnation\nDeveloper: Game Freak\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nComing our way in 2026 is a brand new game from Game Freak, an action RPG with soulslike elements called Beast of Reincarnation. In this stunning new world, a mysterious beast is spreading blight across the land, and it's up to Emma the Sealer to pursue and stop it once and for all. From the upcoming PC game's trailer, it looks like Emma will have plenty of bosses to take down as she and her white wolf companion travel around the setting. We'll keep you posted on a release date, because let's be honest, Beast of Reincarnation already seems like a banger.\nAt Fate's End\nDeveloper: Thunder Lotus\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nCalling all cozy gamers who need a good emotional crisis, the developers behind Spiritfarer (Thunder Lotus) have a new game in the works. Titled At Fate's End, this upcoming action adventure looks magical, stylish, and packed with action.

Hopefully, we will learn more details soon.\nTBC\nThick as Thieves\nDeveloper: OtherSide Entertainment\nRelease date: TBC\nThick as Thieves is an upcoming multiplayer PvPvE game that's coming our way from Deus Ex developer, Warren Spector.

With a fresh co-op campaign, you can also expect returning multiplayer favorites like Zombies return.\nGrave Seasons\nDeveloper: Perfect Garbage\nRelease date: TBC\nGrave Seasons puts a horror-spin on the farming sim formula by getting you to root out the supernatural serial killer who calls the town you're in home. As you grow crops, fish and mine, you'll have the chance to develop romantic relationships if you so choose as you set out to help the locals and uncover the truth. Who you get to know and develop bonds with will matter as you can even romance the killer.\nPersona 4 Revival\nDeveloper: Atlus\nRelease date: TBC\nWell, after years of wishing for it, Atlus has finally given the people what they want: a Persona 4 remake. Announced during the Xbox Games Showcase at Summer Game Fest 2025, we're going to be diving back into one of the best JRPG-infused murder mysteries around with Persona 4 Revival. From what we've seen so far, the story seems to remain largely untouched, and the turn-based party system is still in place. However, hopefully, we see some tweaks to the dungeons and enemy encounters in the future once a release date is announced. Stay tuned for updates!\nILL\nDeveloper: Team Cloud\nRelease date: TBC\nHands down the gnarliest game of Summer Game Fest 2025 ILL is an upcoming PC game that looks to be skin-crawling in the best possible way. From developer Team Cloud, gameplay is action-heavy with gunshots galore and multiple gruesome enemies to slay. In the trailer for the game, we saw mutant creatures with four mouths, blood splatters, and even some zombie babies. What more could a horror fan want? No release date has been revealed just yet, so stay tuned for updates.\nFractured Blooms\nDeveloper: Serenity Forge\nRelease date: TBC\nDescribed at Summer Game Fest 2025 as Doki Doki Literature Club meets Silent Hill, Fractured Blooms looks like a first-person farming simulator with a dark twist. Its reveal trailer jumped from growing tomatoes to walking down dark corridors and jumping at self-slamming doors, all while ominous narration talks about preparing dinner and\u2026 eating legs? At this point we know about as much as you do \u2013 which is still more than we'd like to \u2013 but perhaps this psychological horror will be best going into without spoiling too much.\nLego Voyagers\nDeveloper: Light Brick Studio\nRelease date: TBC\nWhen it comes to PC games, Lego offers hit after hit, which is why we were thrilled to see devs take the plunge and give us some more semi-realistic Lego action with Lego Voyagers. In this upcoming PC game, we'll follow two tiny single square bricks as they navigate numerous diorama-style areas. They'll have to work together to build paths forward and get the job done. It's wholesome looking, very cute, and seems like a great time to be honest. Hopefully, we get a release date soon!\nChrono Odyssey\nDeveloper: Chrono Studio\nRelease date: TBC\nChrono Odyssey is a new action MMO RPG developed in Unreal Engine 5 that will bring us to a \"seamless open-world setting\" that's said to feature various biomes.

With lots of enemies to face and boss battles to take on, The Cube challenges you to try and survive whatever is thrown out you each round.\nFelt That: Boxing\nDeveloper: Sans Strings Studio, Stoopid Buddy Studios\nRelease date: TBC\nIt's odd to highlight the realism of some of the fuzziest puppets imaginable, but when you see Felt That: Boxing in action it really does just look like you're watching a recording of some actual pro puppeteering (it's made in Unreal). Putting you in the boxing gloves of Ezra 'Fuzz-E' Wright, \"an unadoptable orphan\", this mixes arcade action with comedic, crass storytelling to tell the tale of your rise up the ranks to master of the ring.\nKiller Inn\nDeveloper: Tactic Studio\nRelease date: TBC\nWhat if Dead by Daylight had a baby with Cluedo? Meet Killer Inn, an upcoming multiplayer horror-mystery game from Square Enix where players have to deduce the culprit of an ongoing murder investigation \u2013 or do the killing themselves. You can set traps and find other means to survive against the hidden killer in this Among Us-like, but if solving crimes (or committing them) isn't quite your bag, escape is always an option.

The campaign is set to star noted Ark superfan Vin Diesel, while the game itself will feature a larger play space, more dynamic world events and dinosaur AI, and overhauled progression and survival systems.

However, five years after the announcement it was in the works, fans are still to see the Elder Scrolls 6 release. Don't worry, though; this game is still on its way, and now that Starfield has launched, we know that Elder Scrolls 6 is next on Bethesda's schedule before they start working on other titles like Fallout 5. Currently, the most likely release date is 2026, despite the game initially targeting a 2024 release. So, hang in tight because there is still plenty of waiting ahead of us, it seems.\nFairgames\nDeveloper: Haven\nRelease date: TBC\nFairgame$ - as it's officially styled - is a new heist game from Jade Raymond's new studio Haven.

Which is one reason why Haunted Chocolatier has so easily captured our attention. In this upcoming RPG, we'll be taking on the role of a chocolate maker living in a fantasy castle, and we're already in love with it. Spooky settings, a cool visual style, and a smart iteration of the core Stardew systems make this one of the most highly anticipated new PC games out there - even if we have no idea when we could possibly be seeing it.\nMarvel's Blade\nDeveloper: Arkane Studios\nRelease date: TBC\nA standout moment from The Game Awards 2023 was the announcement that the upcoming Marvel game, Marvel's Blade, is in development. The teaser trailer lets on very little, save that the iconic vampire hero of comic book legend is to make his long-awaited return to video games at some point in the next few years. Being made in tandem with Xbox, it's not expected to load outside the Xbox Series X or PC platforms. It's a bummer for Sony fans, but good news for us PC players keen to sink our teeth into a dynamic single-player experience.\nPhantom Blade 0\nDeveloper: S-Game\nRelease date: TBC\nPhantom Blade 0 is a hack-n-slash RPG that's \"the spiritual rebirth of the original Rainblood\". It's an Unreal Engine 5 creation, which is allowing it to be much larger and richer than the source material, without losing its core. Set in the Phantom World, you'll blend Chinese Kungfu, with occult arts, and other powers that make Phantom Blade 0 a little different.

We'll update you as soon as we have more information.\nShe Dreams Elsewhere\nDeveloper: Studio Zevere\nRelease date: TBC\nThalia has found herself trapped within her own mind, having to face off against her anxieties and nightmares if she wants to stand any chance of freeing herself from a coma. Looking like a cross between Undertale and Earthbound, She Dreams Elsewhere has its own twists on combat, where you can customize your party members using charms. Building Connections with your pals will also enable you to learn more about them (which sounds a bit like Persona to us). We're already entranced by the sheer style of this one.\nSkate 4\nDeveloper: Full Circle\nRelease date: TBC\nSkate 4 (now titled Skate) has been in the works for a while, since 2021, to be exact. But hey, most good things are worth waiting for. The iconic Skate series has let players explore on wheels and kickflip their way into stardom for years now. However, the new entry is going to change the game as we know it with its free-to-play format and fresh setting. While we still don\u2019t have a release date for the upcoming skateboarding game, playtesting has been underway since July 2022, so it\u2019s only a matter of time before we hear news.

      "text": "Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater \u2013 Everything we know about the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake\nA complete guide to all the latest news and details about the upcoming Metal Gear Solid 3 remake\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the name of the upcoming Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, which is set to bring the 2004 experience back with new additions, visual enhancements, and more. With the release just a few months away, we got another look at the remake of one of the best best PS2 games of all-time during the Summer Game Fest season, with a shiny new trailer dropping during the June State of Play.\nWith early impressions painting the picture of a remake that captures the experience of the original, it already looks like longtime fans are in for a treat, and with fresh modes and more rounding out the adventure, it promises to be a great way for newcomers to experience the iconic stealth game.\nWith one of the best game stories - even if it is pretty complex - and lots of bells and whistles that will bring it into the modern era, it's quickly shaping up to be one of the biggest new games for 2025. With more trailers giving us a look at gameplay, fresh details dropping about a new mode, and more, read on below for a full recap of everything we know so far about Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.\nMetal Gear Solid 3 remake release date\nThe Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater release date is August 28, 2025. That means we only have a few months left of waiting, folks.\nThis Metal Gear Solid 3 remake has been a long time coming, as well. The title was initially announced in 2023 with a 2024 launch window. However, the upcoming game was pushed back, leaving fans wondering about the new Metal Gear remake for a few months. With the wait almost over, now is the perfect time to check out our list of the best stealth games of all time to get you back into the sneaking mood.\nMetal Gear Solid 3 remake platforms\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be launching on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC when August 28 comes around this year. Like most big game releases, console fans can also expect to see a physical release of the title on launch day. However, PC players will only have a digital copy of the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake available to them.\nThe game will also be available for PS5 Pro players as it's officially on the list of PS5 Pro-enhanced games over at Sony. So, yeah, there are plenty of choices for you platform-wise. If you're looking for more details on Sony's latest console before picking up this game, you can check out our PS5 Pro review for more details!\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nMetal Gear Solid 3 remake pre-orders\nThe good news is that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater pre-orders are now live on Steam and both PlayStation and Microsoft's storefronts. Pre-ordering the standard edition of the game will cost you $69.99/ \u00a369.99, while pre-ordering the deluxe edition will run you $79.99/\u00a379.99.\nThe deluxe edition will give you access to the game two days ahead of the base release date, meaning you can start playing on August 26. It also comes with the \"Sneaking DLC pack\" which includes a handful of cosmetic items such as new uniforms and equipment for Snake.\nBelow is a list of everything included in the Sneaking DLC pack:\n- Battle Dress - Uniform\n- Sneaking Suit - Uniform\n- Crocodile Suit - Uniform\n- Naked (Woodland) - Uniform\n- Naked (Ammunition Belt) - Uniform\n- Gold - Uniform\n- Face: Glasses - Face\n- Face: Sunglasses -Face\n- Kerotan Mask - Equipment\n- GA-KO Mask - Equipment\nMetal Gear Solid 3 remake trailer\nThere have been several Metal Gear Solid 3 remake trailers, but the latest showing came during the PlayStation State of Play June 2025 showcase during Summer Game Fest. In it, we get to see some gameplay in action, with Snake sneaking in various ways up above and low to the ground - we even see him the water (complete with a crocodile disguise). Of course, the signature box makes an appearance, too.\nMetal Gear Solid 3 remake gameplay\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a stealth action game that will primarily stick to the gameplay of the original PlayStation 2 game. You'll be sneaking through forests and bases, taking down guards, and trying to fight off the subordinates of the Boss.\nIn the trailer shown during the February 2025 PlayStation State of Play showcase, we also saw Snake using some martial arts to overpower a guard. This indicates that \"close-quarters combat\" or \"CQC\" - aka the hand-to-hand combat system from the original game- is making a comeback in this remake as well.\nIn terms of new features in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the big difference is visuals. The remake looks stunning, and cut scenes feel dynamic as they allow you to zoom in and out of each 4K scene with ease. The PlayStation 2's original control scheme, which, let's be honest, was far from perfect, has had an overhaul in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater as well, along with animations getting a fresh coat of paint as well.\nAs our hands-on Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater preview (which you can watch in video form above) of the game points out, in terms of remakes, it takes more of a purist approach. It makes quality-of-life improvements and upgrades the visuals, however, the original's gameplay and core story are largely untouched.\nAnother fun gameplay feature that's returning in the remake is that PS5 players will have an Ape Escape mode where Snake has to chase and catch cartoonish monkeys with a habit of mocking you across the map. This mode is, of course, from the Metal Gear cross-over with the Ape Escape games. However, Xbox players won't be getting to experience this since Ape Escape is a Sony Property.\nInstead, Xbox players will be getting a mode with a Bomberman crossover. We're still waiting on news regarding what PC players will be getting here, so stay tuned as more details head our way.\nMetal Gear Solid 3 remake online multiplayer\nDuring the Konami Press Start showcase, a Metal Gear Sold Delta Snake Eater online multiplayer mode was revealed. Called Fox Hunt, the new, original mode is said to broaden \"the franchises core stealth element where players must utilize their environments to camouflage and evade opposing players\".\nFox Hunt producer Yu Sahara spoke on the online multiplayer mode for Snake Eater, and put emphasis on the fact that will many will think on Metal Gear Online, this is very much it's own an original experience, saying that \"the landscape of multiplayer games has changed a lot since MGO\".\nMetal Gear Solid 3 remake development\nThe big question on everyone's mind about Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater's development is whether Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima was involved in the project after he publicly split with Konami. Well, we're here to set the record straight. Kojima Productions is not involved with the new Metal Gear remake.\nThe title is instead being handled by Konami's internal developer, Konami Digital Entertainment, and Virtuos (who has co-developed titles such as the Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster and Assassin's Creed Liberation Remastered). Despite the fact that neither Kojima nor original artist Yoji Shinkawa is involved in the new game, Konami has made sure to stick to a faithful adaptation of the original game. The Metal Gear official Twitter account reaffirmed this point in a post, explaining how it led to the game's name \"Metal Gear Solid Delta\".\n\"The Delta symbol (\u0394) was chosen because its meaning fits the concept of the remake project,\" the official Metal Gear account clarified. \"Delta means 'change' or 'difference' without changing structure.\"\nThe Delta symbol (\u0394) was chosen because its meaning fits the concept of the remake project. Delta means \"change\" or \"difference\" without changing structure.#MetalGearSolid#MGSDelta pic.twitter.com/LRWrNzg3heMay 25, 2023\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is also the first Metal Gear game not to use Fox Engine - which was a proprietary game engine by Konami. Instead, the game uses Unreal Engine 5.

      "text": "Little Nightmares 3: Everything we know so far about the new horror game from Supermassive\nLittle Nightmares 3 is coming to us from Until Dawn developer Supermassive, and its set to arrive in October\nLittle Nightmares 3 is officially coming this October to bring us into its darkly amtosmpheric world known as The Spiral. Taking on the role of protagonists Alone and Low, we'll be venturing through decidedly creepy settings, with the recent Bandai Namco summer showcase once again giving us another looking at the likes of the Carneval funfair, filled with unsettling attractions.\nAlong with a dedicated Little Nightmares showcase that gave us more insight into the setting and features of the upcoming horror game, we've also gotten plenty of trailers, gameplay footage, and details from Little Nightmares 3's developer Supermassive Games, the studio behind the likes of Until Dawn and the future release, Directive 8020.\nEver since it was first announced during Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase in 2023 there's been a growing level excitement for what promises to be one of the biggest new games for 2025 coming our way this spooky season. For a full roundup of everything we know so far about Little Nightmares 3, read on below.\nLittle Nightmares 3 release date confirmed\nThe Little Nightmares 3 release date has been set for October 10, 2025\nFollowing its initial reveal, the return of Little Nightmares was set to land sometime in 2024 before Supermassive posted a statement in May of that year confirming its delay into 2025. The reveal of the October date then came in the Little Nightmares Showcase event, which confirmed we'll be getting the upcoming adventure during the spooky season.\nLittle Nightmares 3 platforms\nLittle Nightmares 3 is set to release on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, Switch, and Switch 2\nThe horror-filled adventure was initially confirmed to be among the upcoming Xbox Series X games, upcoming PS5 games, and upcoming Switch games, as well as last-gen consoles. But it wasn't until the Little Nightmares showcase event that we got confirmation that a Switch 2 version of Little Nightmares 3 will also be launching, which is great news for those who've picked up Nintendo's latest console.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nLittle Nightmares trailers\nWe've gotten a helping of Little Nightmares 3 trailers following its initial reveal. With an announcement trailer (which you can watch above) giving us our first look at the new protagonists of the adventure, we also got to see various obstacles they'll face in the dark world, with teases of different locations and a very ominous mirror.\nIn the \"You're being watched\" trailer (below), we're introduced to a mysterious figure who's said to always be watching every move we make in the world. It looks like we'll be tracked on surveillance-style monitors. How unsettling.\nLittle Nightmares 3 story\nLittle Nightmares 3 story follows protagonists Low and Alone, two young children who became best friends when they encountered each other in a \"lonely nightmare\". As they get lost in the frightening world of Nowhere, they'll have to work together to try and find a way out together, or risk being condemned to a \"fate worse than death\".\nWith emphasis once again put on the idea that you'll be entering a world \"not made for children\", Little Nightmares 3 looks set to build on the chilling atmosphere of games past, and of course, just like any number of the best horror games, you can expect to face some unsettling figures that won't be giving you a warm welcome in Low and Alone's shoes.\nFor a refresher on the previous games, be sure to check out our Little Nightmares review and Little Nightmares 2 review.\nLittle Nightmares 3 setting\nThe setting of Little Nightmares 3 will once again bring us into the universe known as Nowhere, which is only accessible through dreams.\nWith Low and Alone lost in a nightmare, they'll be venturing through various locations within a twisted place called The Spiral, and face all kinds of monstrous dangers. From a sandy Necropolis where a giant baby resides, to a creepy candy factory and \"filthy funfair\" known as the \"Carnevale\". Each place will be filled with residents who will try to hunt you down, so you can expect to face obstacles and be chased by some nasty inhabitants.\nLittle Nightmares 3 gameplay\nWe've gotten to see quite a lot of Little Nightmares 3 gameplay since it was first announced, trailers showing off some gameplay elements, as well as an in-depth walkthrough from Bandai Namco which showed off 18-minutes of footage of the \"many hidden hazards of the Necropolis\". In the latter video, we see Low and Alone venture through a sand storm before climbing up into the ruins of the Necropolis.\nUnfortunately, this is the playground of a monstrous baby that looms large over the location, and who seems to be hellbent on making you its next playthings. We see how both Alone and Low have to sneak out of the way of the baby's line of sight, or find safety behind cover, which transforms the area into a scary game of hide and seek.\nDuring the Little Nightmares Showcase event, we also got to see 11-minutes of gameplay, only this time, we were taken through the unsettling Carnevale location in the Spiral. Producer Coralie Feniello introduces the setting by describing it as a \"funfair filled with disturbing attractions and frightening visitors\", and we certainly get a taste of that in the footage.\nCapturing the overwhelming feeling of being a small kid in a big fairground, we follow Alone and Low as they sneak past big lumbering visitors and unsettling attractions - from a circus-like tent, to drowned apple-bobbing, and a Ferris wheel - in the rain soaked location, which is accompanied by the occasional cracks of thunder. Towards the end of the gameplay, the pair are perused by a large figure holding a club - it's all very creepy.\nNot unlike the earlier Little Nightmares adventures, the gameplay we've seen so far shows off some familiar elements, such as puzzle-like sections that see the pair work together to move boxes, or make it across a platform. There are also shots of the duo using various objects to make it through areas - such as using a parasol-like makeshift umbrella to float across a ledge. With some unsettling scenarios, we'll often have to run, hide, or a combination of both, and even if the occasion calls for it, defend ourselves.\nIs Little Nightmares 3 co-op?\nLittle Nightmares 3 will be the first entry in the series to support online co-op.\nSpeaking on co-op, Bandai Namco producer Coralie Feniello said it was \"the most requested [feature] by our community\" following Little Nightmares 2, which had the perfect set-up for a similar feature since it saw you play as Mono as he travelled through the world alongside Six - the lead character from the first game.\nBut you'll also be able to play the entirety of Little Nightmares 3 solo, too. Should you do so, one of the characters will be an AI that you give instructions to, as Feniello explains:\n\"We don't want to have the AI being too smart, because the player might feel like they are doing everything, but we don't want to have the AI feeling dumb, either. The first time you see an object that the AI can interact with, you have to call the AI, and then they come and they do it. But in terms of gameplay, we are making sure that it's the same level of experience and as enjoyable in multiplayer [as it is] in single. But maybe in single, you will have a bit more on the narrative part.\"\nLittle Nightmares 3 development\nWhile the first two games in the Little Nightmares series were made by developer Tarsier Studios, Supermassive has taken up the mantle for the third installment, with Bandai Namco back on board as the game's publisher. Supermassive is a studio well-versed in the horror genre, having made narrative, survival experiences like Until Dawn and The Quarry, so it'll be interesting to see how the team puts their stamp on the universe.\nTarsier, on the other hand, is currently developing a new horror IP with Reanimal, which promises to take you on an \"even darker and more terrifying journey than ever before\".\nLittle Nightmares 3 pre-order\nLittle Nightmares 3 pre-orders are now live on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, with Switch and Switch 2 pre-orders set to come at a later date.\nBandai Namco revealed the game with launch with different editions. Alongside the Standard Edition which costs $39.99 / \u00a334.99, there will also be a Digital Deluxe Edition for $59.99 / \u00a349.99, which comes with the Secrets of the Spiral Expansion Pass and the Residents Costume Packs.\nFor those after more collectible goodies, there's also a Mirror Edition that comes with the Deluxe edition content along with a Low and Alone 12 inch figurine, a metal game case, artbook, physical and digital soundtrack, stickers, and a themed box.\nFinally, there's also a Spiral Edition exclusive to the Bandai Namco store that comes with everything in the Mirror edition along with a music box base, a Nome controller/ phone holder, and a double-sided coin of Low and Alone.\nI started out writing for the games section of a student-run website as an undergrad, and continued to write about games in my free time during retail and temp jobs for a number of years. Eventually, I earned an MA in magazine journalism at Cardiff University, and soon after got my first official role in the industry as a content editor for Stuff magazine. After writing about all things tech and games-related, I then did a brief stint as a freelancer before I landed my role as a staff writer here at GamesRadar+. Now I get to write features, previews, and reviews, and when I'm not doing that, you can usually find me lost in any one of the Dragon Age or Mass Effect games, tucking into another delightful indie, or drinking far too much tea for my own good.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "Borderlands 4: Everything we know so far\nThe Borderlands 4 Switch 2 release date has been set for October 3\nBorderlands 4 is coming our way this September to bring us more looter shooter action. Gearbox's new adventure was first officially revealed in 2024, and since then, we've learned a lot more about the next Borderlands game - including, most recently, that it's set to launch on Switch 2 in October.\nWith a Borderlands 4 Direct back in April that revealed more details about the improve co-op systems, we've also gotten to see more about the Vault Hunters we'll be meeting, including new Siren, Vex. Most recently, a video from Gearbox also gave us further insight into playable melee character Rafa. Set to build on what's come before in the best Borderlands games, we've also been shown the planet of Kairos that we'll be venturing to as we experience a plot that's said to be a \"turning point\" in the Borderlands universe.\nOriginally set to arrive a little later in the year before Gearbox confirmed Borderlands will be landing 11 days earlier, the studio has also confirmed the new game will be among the lineup of upcoming Switch 2 games, and now that its officially gone gold, there's never been a better time to get a refresher on all that's been reveal as we approach the launch date. For more on all things Borderlands 4, read on below.\nBorderlands 4 release date\nThe Borderlands 4 release date is set for September 12, 2025 for PC, Xbox Series X, and PS5, and will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 a month later on October 3, 2025.\n2K announced the amended release date, which brings the launch forward by 11 days, with Borderlands 4 originally slated to arrive on September 23. The title will launch across all platforms simultaneously, with news coming as part of the February PlayStation State of Play.\nBorderlands 4 trailer\nThe first Borderlands 4 trailer doesn't feature any actual gameplay, but it does set the tone for what Gearbox is trying to capture here. You can watch the teaser above, which showcases a fractured planet under siege from the skies. However, below you can also find the latest trailer for Borderlands 4, which was revealed during The Game Awards 2024.\nWhile this second trailer is also mainly cinematics, it does show some gameplay, with players stalking around different environments and shooting at enemies. We also see some platforming in the teaser, as well as some cool abilities being used to crowd-control targets.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nBorderlands 4 platforms\nBorderlands 4 will launch on PC, PS5, Nintendo Switch 2, and Xbox Series X. 2K Games has confirmed that the title will launch on both the Epic Game Store and Steam storefronts.\nWhile Gearbox hasn't confirmed this firmly, it looks like Borderlands 4 won't be on PS4 or Xbox One, as the platforms were missing from the reveal trailer. Future Switch 2 owners will be in for a treat, though, as the next generation Nintendo console was confirmed as one of the Borderlands 4 launch platforms we can expect just a month later in October.\nGearbox boss Randy Pitchford did confirm, though, that there will be a download on Switch 2 regardless of whether or not you buy a physical copy, and it's said to run at 30FPS.\nFirst Borderlands 4 gameplay details\nAlongside a Borderlands 4 gameplay trailer (which you can watch above), we also got an 18 minute long gameplay deep dive from Gearbox that gave us an in-depth look at the looter shooter in action. With members of the development team guiding us through the footage, we get to see how the open zones of Kairos can be freely explored, and you can expect to tuck into a variety of new activities - which you can do solo or with pals. One such activity is known as a Silo, which is a location that houses old tech you can hijack.\nAs you \"assume the role of a legendary Vault Hunter\", you'll be blasting your way through \"hordes of enemies in search of new treasures to loot\", with \"the deepest and most diverse skill trees of any Borderlands title yet\". In an interview with us here at GamesRadar+, senior project producer Anthony Nicholson also detailed that the upcoming entry will play around \"the humor and comedic opportunities we explored in Borderlands 2\".\nGearbox is also aiming to give \"an unprecedented level of expression\" to players, with \"billions of weapons and accessories\" to loot and acquire. And speaking of weapons, the upcoming adventure looks set to do things a little differently in that department, with some changes to guns - namely, that there three new manufacturers, and a \"Licensed parts system\":\n\"With the new Licensed Parts system, you can find guns that incorporate the behaviors and abilities from multiple manufacturers into a single weapon, fueling our wildest loot variety yet,\" a PlayStation blog details. \"In addition, Borderlands 4 reworks our approach to the iconic Legendary guns that have unique effects you won\u2019t find on any other piece of gear.\"\n\"In Borderlands 3, Legendaries dropped too often, devaluing them and making other loot feel less special overall. In our new system, not only do all guns feel great, but now Legendary drops will truly be special events.\"\nGearbox has also said that a principal focus for Borderlands 4 is in the balance of approachability and complexity. \"I think our RPG side of the game is so important,\" says creative director Graeme Timmins. \"Just like our first-person side, where we're always looking to expand and add depth, we're doing that on the RPG side, but we don't want to do that at the cost of complexity.\"\nBorderlands 4 setting\nThe Borderlands 4 setting has been confirmed, and it's taking us away from Pandora to a new planet known as Kairos. With our first proper look at the setting during the detailed gameplay deep dive, the PlayStation blog post that followed the showcase also sheds more light on the planet.\nSaid to be \"rife with warring factions, deadly fauna, and desperate inhabitants\", Kairos was kept hidden for thousands of years thanks to an oppressive figure known as the Timekeeper, who controlled the world's residents with \"cybernetic implants called Bolts and a synthetic army of soldiers known as The Order\".\nBut things change when a rogue moon, which was teleported from Pandora at the end of Borderlands 3 by famed Vault Hunter Lilith, pierces the protective veil of the planet and kickstarts a whole lot of chaos that you'll get to be a part of.\nIn a video titled \"Welcome to Kairos\", the team at Gearbox went into more detail about the \"prison planet\" as managing narrative director Lin Joyce put it. When we arrive on the world, Joyce says the residents there are \"hungrier than they've ever been to get off Kairos and fight back against the oppression that they've been living under\" there.\nWhile Pitchford has previously confirmed it's not open-world per se, it is set to be the most open and free Borderlands game to date, and it certainly looks expansive. Said to feature \"seamlessly connected spaces\", the world is made up of four zones that you can explore with \"next to no loading times\". Kairos will also feature a dynamic weather system, with lots of side activities to discover.\nBorderlands 4 Vault Hunters\nGearbox has confirmed that Borderlands 4 will feature four new Vault Hunters, with the studio continuing its tradition of cycling new playable characters into the fold.\n\"We think it's important that we switch it up and not do just rote designs, game to game,\" says Timmins.\nWith a look at some of the new Vault Hunters in action during the deep dive gameplay footage, Gearbox has revealed details about two of the playable characters: Vex the new Siren, who uses supernatural phase energy and is able to conjure minions, and Rafa, an Exo-soldier and former Tediore trooper who uses an experimental exo-suit.\nIn gameplay overview videos dropped by Gearbox, we've gotten to see an extensive look at Vex, as we as a more recent look at Rafa, who's described as a \"battle-ready combat veteran\" who serves as a \"great gateway for FPS players to step into the series.\"\nSome familiar Borderlands faces will also return, including Zane, Moxxi, and Claptrap. We can also expect to meet a lot of new characters in the world of Kairos, with the deep dive gameplay video showing off a few, including a drone known as Echo-4 who will joining us on our adventures. The little robot buddy can hack equipment, scan the environment, and also guide us to objectives in the world.\nBorderlands 4 co-op\nBorderlands 4 co-op support has also been confirmed. The upcoming adventure will feature 4-player online co-op, as well as 2-player split screen couch co-op, so you can get stuck into the core campaign with pals.\nWith cross-play support also included - meaning you can play with others across platforms - a lot of emphasis was put on the improved co-op features coming to the latest entry in a big gameplay deep dive from the team at Gearbox:\n\"Co-op has always been at the heart of Borderlands, and we've put a ton of work into making it better than ever,\" says Nicholson. \"Our improved lobby is just the start. You can also set your own campaign difficulty independently of the rest of the party. This way, everyone can tune the experience to their liking.\"\nIf you get split up during your adventures, Timmins also revealed during the deep dive that you can \"easily fast travel to your friends\", and loot is instanced for each player, so you won't have to fight against each other to bag the goods.\nBorderlands 4 development\nBorderlands 4 is being developed by Gearbox Software, the studio responsible for all mainline games in the franchise. The Gearbox CEO says that Borderlands 4 has been in development for \"several years\" \u2013 the studio's last game was Tiny Tina's Wonderlands in 2022.\nBorderlands 4 will be published by 2K Games \u2013 just as it did with the previous titles. This will, however, be the first Borderlands game to release with Gearbox Software operating as an owned and operated 2K studio \u2013 the company was acquired by Take-Two Interactive in 2024.\nBorderlands 4 has long been teased by both Take-Two and Gearbox. The game appeared on the Linkedin page for a former employee of a Gearbox support studio last year, and the publisher confirmed Borderlands 4 to be in active development back in March 2024.\nRandy Pitchford also started name-dropping the game while trying to get out ahead of the film adaptation \u2013 our Borderlands movie review didn't paint a glowing picture. Still, Pitchford recently told GamesRadar+ that \"I\u2019m confident that our fans are going to be very, very happy with the next video game project,\" and the studio is certainly on the right track after that recent Game Awards trailer.\nCan I pre-order Borderlands 4?\nBorderlands 4 is now available to pre-order across all platforms, with Gearbox revealing that there will be three editions of the upcoming looter shooter. Pre-ordering any of the editions will also get you a Gilded Glory Pack pre-order bonus, which includes a Vault Hunter skin, one weapon skin, and an ECHO-4 drone skin.\nThe Standard Edition will come in at $69.99, while the Deluxe Edition - that comes with a Bounty Pack which will grant post-launch DLC packs, as well as additional vehicles, weapons and gear, Vault Hunter cosmetics, and a special Fire hawk's Fury weapon skin - costs $99.99.\nFinally, the Super Deluxe Edition clocks in at $129.99 and will come with the Vault Hunter pack. This includes new story packs, two new map regions, new gear and weapons, more Vault Hunter and ECHO-4 cosmetics, and the Ornate Order Pack which comes more with skins and goodies.\nWhy not check out the upcoming PS5 games and upcoming Xbox Series X games we think you should have on your radar right now.\nI started out writing for the games section of a student-run website as an undergrad, and continued to write about games in my free time during retail and temp jobs for a number of years.

      "text": "After years of rumor and speculation, finally getting my hands on an actual Xbox handheld is a pretty surreal experience. The ROG Xbox Ally X is an exceptionally impressive piece of technology, and a bold new way to interact with the Xbox ecosystem. It's also the result of a somewhat shocking collaboration between a platform holder looking to get serious about a burgeoning 'Play Anywhere' strategy and a manufacturer looking to widen its mass market appeal \u2013 ASUS having become best known for creating powerful, if somewhat unapproachable, handheld gaming PCs.\nIt's exceptionally rare for platform-holders to collaborate with external partners like this. Hardware is treated as serious business. When you're asking players to make a large financial investment, you better get it right the first time; one wrong move in the console market and it's near impossible to recover.\nThe Dreamcast decimated SEGA. An ill-defined vision crippled the Wii U. It took Sony seven years to regain ground after the PS3 launch debacle. The Xbox One was so poorly received that it inflicted psychic damage on an entire generation of players. Even Valve got a rare reality check with its Steam Machines, forcing the company to eventually refocus its hardware ambitions towards the Steam Deck.\nSo, why risk taking a new hardware initiative out of house? Collaboration is, after all, code for relinquishing some amount of control \u2013 be it over form-factor, internal components, or user experience. All of this preamble is vital context to say that I think Xbox may have made the right move here. The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X \u2013 the two systems headlining this new initiative, set for release in 2025 \u2013 appear to take the best of what Asus already has on the market, matching it with some really interesting refinements and optimizations, to make the system more palatable for a wider mass market.\nHands-on the Xbox handheld\nLet's start with how the ROG Xbox Ally X felt in my hands. At 715 grams, it's technically heavier than the Steam Deck (669 grams) and its OLED variant (640 grams), but you wouldn't know it from the way weight has been distributed across the console. I can't say how well the ROG Xbox Ally X will hold up during longer play-sessions, but the hour I spent with the machine didn't raise any immediate red flags.\nI'm also a big fan of the ROG Xbox Ally X form-factor, with Xbox having worked closely with Asus on a redesign of the existing ROG Ally X. The console features new contoured handgrips, built to the same design principles that inspired the Xbox Wireless Controller. It's largely comfortable, the ABXY button and asymmetrical thumbstick placement make immediate sense to a brain wired to Xbox's controller rhythms.\nXbox's CVP of gaming devices and ecosystem, Roanne Sones, says this has been done to make the console more accommodating to a wider range of handsizes, although I must admit I did still struggle to comfortably stretch my index fingers across the left and right bumpers. The inclusion of Impulse Triggers into the ROG Xbox Ally X design (these aren't included in the cheaper ROG Xbox Ally) felt fantastic as I was chewing through Locust in the opening stages of Gears of War: Reloaded.\nSpeaking of the play experience, it felt exceptionally smooth. The ROG Xbox Ally X is powered by an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor, packs 24GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. I've always been more a console player then a PC gamer, so I'll admit that the significance of the silicon and components inside of the system is a little lost on me. But I know a good feeling and looking video game when I play one.\nPlay Anywhere\nSo while I can't speak to how more demanding titles will ultimately handle on the system \u2013 nor to the experience of Xbox Cloud Gaming or Xbox Remote Play \u2013 there was little obvious daylight between playing a first-party Xbox game natively on ROG Xbox Ally X versus playing it on Xbox Series X. The framerate of Gears Reloaded was rocksolid 60fps, with the system supporting 120Hz refresh rate and FreeSync Premium, and the remastered visuals popped on the 7-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) screen. I'm genuinely impressed, and can easily see the ROG Xbox Ally X becoming a vital part of my commute.\nWhat's really sold me on the concept of the ROG Xbox Ally systems is the work Microsoft has done to optimize the core user-experience. This isn't merely a standard ROG Ally with an Xbox button punched in above the left thumbstick, the Xbox and Windows divisions have collaborated to create a more refined mobile ecosystem. One of the reasons I've always been a little scared off by PC gaming handhelds like the ROG Ally are that they are exactly that \u2013 the standard PC experience scaled down to handheld size. I've always gravitated towards console gaming because I want as few barriers to getting into the games I want to play as possible, optimized for the best possible experience out of the box.\nBooting up the ROG Xbox Ally X, rather than hit standard Windows 11 OS screens I'm pushed directly into the Xbox full screen experience. An aggregated gaming library is right there waiting, designed to reflect the look and style of the traditional Xbox ecosystem as it exists across console, mobile, and cloud devices. I say aggregated gaming library because as well as supporting native, cloud, and remote play experiences, the ROG Xbox Ally systems will also give quick access to all of your video games across Xbox, Game Pass, Battle Net, and any other Windows PC-based storefront. It's really clean, it's fast, and features none of the nonsense that I sometimes (fairly or not) associate with playing on PC.\nThis Xbox full screen experience has been fully optimized for handheld too. Background activity and non-essential tasks in the Windows 11 OS are minimized, routing system resources like the 24GB of memory towards higher framerates and consistent performance. The Xbox button brings up a Game Bar overlay allowing for easy access to apps, chat, and settings, and lets me quickly shift between recently played games. It didn't feel like I was interacting with an existing handheld PC that had been retrofitted to allow for integrated Xbox functionality, but rather a device that was built to deliver it.\nIs it worth it?\nI've been wanting an Xbox handheld for years now. In a world where I can access the best Xbox games through everything from the Series X to web browsers, or punch into Game Pass from Smart TVs and Fire Sticks, it didn't make much sense to me that Microsoft didn't have a comprehensive solution for gaming on the go. The inelegant solution up until now had always been to strap my smartphone into something like the Razer Kishi V2 and pray that the battery life or Wi-Fi connection held. That is about to change.\nI always said I'd purchase a Steam Deck once (and only once) an optimized Game Pass experience was available. I was starting to crack on that purchasing decision, the console becoming more attractive the more I've been exposed to them in the world. But the ROG Xbox Ally X has come around just in time. While I'm certainly curious to know what a first-party developed Xbox handheld would look like \u2013 to be clear, Xbox staff I've spoken to have made no commitment to such a device in the future \u2013 the ROG Xbox Ally X is shaping up to be an exceptionally solid solution. A way to natively pick up my progress of whatever Xbox game I'm playing in any given week, and take it out into the world without having to worry that the experience will be hindered by some invisible force.\nThe question that will ultimately determine whether the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X are a success, however, is the cost of the thing. Xbox and Asus will not speak to pricing just yet, and I am worried that the two systems are going to be prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of players. The existing ROG Ally and ROG Ally X consoles retail at $649.99 and $799.99, respectively. If this pricing structure holds for the ROG Xbox Ally consoles, that would put the two incoming devices as the most expensive pillars of the Xbox hardware family. The Xbox Series X recently increased in price from $499 to $599.\nThe question then, perhaps, Microsoft will be asking players around Holiday 2025 is just how much they value the idea of having a full Xbox experience with them everywhere they go. With a 512GB Steam Deck OLED priced competitively at $549, and the Nintendo Switch 2 at $449.99, it might be an uncomfortable conversation.\nHere's all of the key upcoming Xbox games that you'll be able to play on the ROG Xbox Ally X.\nJosh West is the Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar+.

      "text": "The Blood of Dawnwalker: Everything we know so far\nThe Blood of Dawnwalker looks to be the next big RPG so here's all the latest news and details about the upcoming vampire game\nThe Blood of Dawnwalker is an exciting new vampire RPG coming our way from developer Rebel Wolves. With talent on board that previously worked at The Witcher 3 studio CD Projekt Red, we've steadily gotten to learn more about its take on vampiric lore, as well as the intriguing protagonist will be filling the shoes of in its dark, alternate take on medieval Europe.\nAs Coen, who's half human, half vampire, we'll be setting out to try to save our family over the course of 30 days and 30 nights. Described as a sandbox RPG that will let us shape our journey, we've gotten to see a gameplay trailer during the Xbox Game Showcase 2025, along with a more in-depth overview showcasing a part of a midgame quest, which only makes our sense of anticipation for this new game grow.\nAnd with more from Rebel Wolves in a recent Q&A and another appearance during a Bandai Namco Summer showcase, which shed light on the \"experimental\" new open-world that will \"push the genre forward\", there's already a lot of details to sink our teeth into out this new RPG. For a full overview of everything we know so far The Blood of Dawnwalker, read on below.\nThe Blood of Dawnwalker release date speculation\nBlood of Dawnwalker is set to launch sometime in 2026.\nWe still don't have an exact release date, but in a trailer that showcased during the Xbox Game Showcase 2025 , it confirmed the 2026 year window.\nThere have been hints that we'll learn more about the game around summer this year. So once we have more state-of-development updates and news, we'll be able to narrow down a potential release date even further. For now, though, we recommend sitting tight and checking out our list of the best horror games to keep you busy in the meantime.\nThe Blood of Dawnwalker platforms\nOnce it releases, you'll be able to play The Blood of Dawnwalker on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nUnfortunately, this is a heavy-duty game that was developed using Unreal Engine 5, so we don't expect a Nintendo Switch release anytime soon. We also doubt that it will be added to our list of upcoming Switch 2 games in the future, either. However, you never know! If Nintendo gives us any surprising release date news, we'll be sure to let you know.\nThe Blood of Dawnwalker trailer\nThe first cinematic trailer for The Blood of Dawnwalker is here, and you can watch it for yourself above. In the clip, we see Coen desperately trying to save his little sister, Lunka, who has the plague. The two run into an abandoned ruin, where they become surrounded by the King's men who are aiming to kill Lunka in order to stop the spread of the disease. However, before the little girl dies, a group of vampires suddenly descend on the army like an all-you-can-eat buffet.\nThe trailer gives us our first real look at the vampire Brencis, who takes up the fallen king's crown and gives Lunka his blood after Coen begs him to save her. Don't let the child-saving antics fool you, though: Brencis is by no means a good guy.\n\"I've been watching your little valley. Pestilence, famine, killing, and blood spilled carelessly like water. Things will be different now for all of you.\" he says after destroying the crown and letting his undead friends literally tear a human limb from limb in front of the siblings. His words are pretty ominous if you ask us, and we imagine that nothing good can come from waking the ancient vampire's wrath.\nThe Blood of Dawnwalker story and setting\nThe Blood of Dawnwalker is set in AD 1347 in a fictional kingdom called Vale Sangora that's located \"somewhere in the Carpathians\" (aka Central to Southeastern Europe). In this world, darkness has spread as humans face a plague followed by the imposing force of the ancient vampire Brencis - who forces the human population into a life of servitude and blood taxes.\nWe follow a young man named Coen, who ends up with the vampiric curse. However, Coen isn't a full-blown creature of the night just yet. He is still half-human, meaning that he is a Dawnwalker: a being who can still navigate both the night and day. Described as a Jekyll and Hyde-style character, he'll need all the supernatural abilities now afforded to him as he races against the clock to try and save his family in only 30 days and 30 nights.\nWhile we don't know the full story of Blood of Dawnwalker, we assume there will be more political upheaval and social dynamics to explore, given Tomaszkiewicz's work on The Witcher 3. We also know that Brencis will have a massive part to play in the story as he is set to be the game's main antagonist.\nFrom the game's trailer we also know that Coen's actions will largely revolve around his bond with his sick sister named Lunka. The official Dawnwalker Twitter account has also been gradually posting characters' backstories for all of us to explore. For instance, we recently learned about the origin of an ancient Greek vampire who appeared in the cinematic trailer called Xanthe.\n\"She was a priestess, once, on a remote Greek island, the name of which she has since forgotten,\" the post reads. The account also shared that Brencis was born during the Roman Empire, and we discovered that the other vampires in the trailer are named Bakir and Ambrus.\nBorn in the Roman Empire under the name Caeso Burrienus Laurentius, AD 131, to a noble family who owned massive latifundia, Brencis was destined for greatness.He joined the rank of Senators and quickly rose to the top of Roman officialdom, with ambitions to become the next\u2026 pic.twitter.com/rA2Uvvfu0UJanuary 16, 2025\nExcitingly, it's also been revealed that the story of The Blood of Dawnwalker is akin to a narrative sandbox and is said to be \"so non-linear that you can align with the human rebellion or finish the game without ever meeting them\". Once prologue wraps, we'll essentially be able to have free reign over how we approach saving our family, meaning we'll have a lot of agency to shape our own journey in the RPG.\nBlood of the Dawnwalker vampire lore\nMore details also shed light on vampiric side of the RPG in a Xbox Wire blog post, which revealed how one turns another. With a different spin on the classic lore we've come to know in popular culture, The Blood of Dawnwalker sets out to \"honor the classic vision\" of \"elegant nobility of the night\", while also \"introducing some twists that make our vampires stand out in more distinct, sometimes unsettling ways.\"\nOne such way in how a human gets turned, which sees a vampire pull out one of their teeth and \"pierce the heart of their chosen target\". This ritual is said to \"play a crucial role\" in Coen's transformation into a dawnwalker, but as a half human, something is said to have gone wrong in his case. While this is only lightly teased, what happens to Coen promises to \"have far-reaching implications\" in the world. How intriguing.\nThe Blood of Dawnwalker gameplay\nBlood of Dawnwalker is a single-player open-world game that is also marketed as the first chapter in a \"new saga\" from Konrad Tomaszkiewicz (one of the directors of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt). The upcoming game will be a story-focused RPG with multiple endings, and the open-world setting we'll venture to is said to be smaller in scale than other adventures so you feel like you know place.\nSome gameplay footage initially appeared in a trailer which debuted during the Xbox Game showcase 2025 (which you can watch above). In it, we see protagonist Coen dodging blows and fighting in close quarters with a sword as he speaks of monsters that roam in the shadows and take advantage of those in the light.\nThe follow-up Xbox Wire post directly after the showcase also shed some light on Coen's combat skills, with the developers at Rebel Moon studying \"medieval fighting styles\", with some trained swordsmen even on team. As a human by day, Coen will learn magic that's \"raw\" and \"ritual-based\", with dark primordial origins - meaning that the magic will be tied to grounded elements such as blood, heat, and air. Casting requires you to become a sort of conduit to occult carvings and runes.\nAt night, Coen's vampiric side awakens, where you can choose to fight with your \"claws, enhanced strength\", and \"dark powers\", that are \"only available after sunset\". If you do use these skills, it will affect your human side and feeds into a system that's tied to Coen's blood craving - which is connected to his health and hunger. Lose health, and he becomes more suspectable to losing control and giving into his vampiric side. This can even lead to some bad consequences, and potentially even lock you out of certain questlines.\nCreative director Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz also revealed that the RPG is a sandbox that gives you a lot of freedom to do things like \"kill off a lot of NPCs\" - including really important ones you encounter on your journey.\nIn a 20-minute gameplay overview video, we also got to see more of the RPG in action during a quest take takes place midgame, which is said to feature \"legendary swords and a haunted alms house\". While we don't get much more detail on the questline itself beyond the fact that Coen is chasing leads to discover a \"powerful weapon\", we are shown some of the gameplay systems, including swordplay against travelling bandits on the road.\nWe see Coen is able to cast a hex known as \"Burning Blood\", which boils the blood of his foes and burns their skin to deal physical damage over time. We also see you can perform finisher moves that in one case decapitates an opponents head clean off. There's some insight into the skill trees, too, with Coen having human perks, vampire perks, shared perks, and active abilities to invest in as you progress. Openly opposing vampires can also have consequences, with the gameplay video highlighting how our choices will impact our approach as we get further into the story.\nThe Blood of Dawnwalker 30 days and 30 nights\nTime is also set to be a massive mechanic in the upcoming game. In fact, to complete the main objective of Dawnwalker, you only have 30 days and 30 nights to save your family.\nNow, if you were worried that a time constraint would make you miss anything on your first playthrough, don't worry: exploring doesn't tick the clock forward. Instead, completing quests will move time along. However, there is some urgency with these said quests, so you can't completely relax either. One feature that will appear in Blood of Dawnwalker is a \"limited time\" quest system.\n\"In short - the player has limited time to complete the main goal - exploring the world doesn't move the time forward, but every quest does. It plays a huge role in our narrative setup, and we'll be expanding on what it means later on,\" explained Rebel Wolves senior PR manager Mateusz Greiner.\nGreiner also assured fans that when choosing what to do in the game, so you can plan your time wisely, \"it will always be clearly telegraphed to the player if an activity moves time forward (and by how much) - players will have control over it.\"\nIn a Q&A series, Rebel Wolves also answered fan questions, including one asking how the time mechanic works. The answer from the studio is quite illuminating. Once again confirming Coen will have 30 days and 30 nights to complete his main objective, the team explained that while the game doesn't end after that period of time, \"Coen's family might suffer the consequences\" if you waste that time.\nRebel Wolves also reiterated that The Blood of Dawnwalker doesn't have a regular clock, and completing quests is the only way time pushes forward, with each quest having an associated \"time cost\".\nFor those wondering about the 'time' mechanic in The Blood of Dawnwalker from the reveal this week.The studio has since clarified more detail:\u25aa\ufe0fYou have 30 days and 30 nights in the game to save your family (main objective)\u25aa\ufe0fThere is no \"hard time limit\" and you aren't\u2026 pic.twitter.com/rrlOgQ1Aw4January 15, 2025\nCan you pre-order The Blood of Dawnwalker?\nThere are currently no pre-orders for The Blood of Dawnwalker live (heartbreaking, we know). This fact won't change for some time as well, given that we don't even have a release window for the game yet.\nIf you are dying to play something right now, you can check out our guide to the best open-world games for 2025. Otherwise, we'll have to be patient and keep our wallets at the ready for Coen's big vampire-filled day out.\nFor more future releases, head over to our guides on all the upcoming PS5 games, upcoming Xbox Series X games, and new PC games.\nAfter reviewing films throughout University and being a cosy game expert for years, I realised that entertainment journalism was my true calling in 2019.

      "text": "Xbox Games Showcase 2025 needs to build on Microsoft's momentum, but it may need to go beyond The Outer Worlds 2 to pull it off\nRoad to Summer Game Fest | In an already standout year for Microsoft, this showcase could be a victory lap \u2013 but there\u2019s always more to prove in the shadow of Switch 2\nLooking ahead to 2025's Xbox Games Showcase at Summer Game Fest this weekend, it'd be all too easy for the publisher to rest on its laurels. Microsoft's gaming division is up by 5% in revenue as of its latest earnings call, and with digital services like Xbox Game Pass making up for hardware sales setbacks, this growth is a testament to all the brilliant new games Microsoft has released over the last six months.\nTrue, some of these games have seen more commercial success than others. South of Midnight's modest reception felt lukewarm after the breakout hype over Avowed, undoubtedly Xbox's standout first-party exclusive of the year so far, while Bethesda and MachineGames' already popular Indiana Jones and the Great Circle became a cross-platform favorite when it launched on PS5 mere months after its Series X debut \u2013 and hey, remember when The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered got shadowdropped five days later?\n2025 is shaping up to be one of the best years for Microsoft Gaming in a very long time. That makes it even more important for the Xbox Games Showcase to make a strong case for the rest of the year, showing off its in-house upcoming Xbox Series X games while championing the flagship console as the best place to play imminent third-party hits. Especially since, you know, the showcase is coming three days after the Nintendo Switch 2 launches \u2013 and I'd be surprised if that didn't cast some kind of shadow.\nThinking outside the (x)box\nJoin GamesRadar+ as we count down to Summer Game Fest 2025, helping you make sense of the busy weekend ahead. Check out the Summer Game Fest schedule for a full list of events.\nWith the promise of both first and third-party Xbox titles on June 8th's lineup, as well as a dedicated The Outer Worlds 2 deep-dive from developer Obsidian immediately after, Xbox Games Showcase 2025 has an opportunity to be not only celebratory, but preparatory.\nThe success of Avowed earlier this year cements Obsidian as the latest Xbox posterchild, with a litany of successful games released since the studio's acquisition by Microsoft in 2018. It makes sense that Xbox is positioning Obsidian front and center as it sets its intentions for the coming months; even as the publisher bears down on its cross-platform \"Xbox Everywhere\" initiative, first-party exclusives will still be of special interest to many tuning in this weekend.\nThere are plenty of likely showstoppers I can think of in that vein. We haven't seen much of Fable 4 since its delay to 2026, while Perfect Dark and Gears of War: E-Day have both been MIA since their respective reveals this time last year. We're also fairly light on State of Decay 3 and Clockwork Revolution news, as despite both currently sitting pretty on our list of expected new games for 2025, rumors and estimates have them likely to be delayed.\nI'm especially keen to see if we get any new Marvel's Blade intel, despite how Arkane Austin said it would be \"going quiet\" for some time in 2023 to focus on its production stages \u2013 but hey, a girl can dream.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nXbox has many third-party partners it could be showcasing this weekend, drumming up some hype around announced games with release dates already set for the imminent future.\nBorderlands 4 is an especially hot topic, with the release date mere months away at this point, as is Mafia: The Old Country and Supermasive Games' Directive 8020. It would also be a brilliant time to firm up some ballpark-2025 release windows for games like Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines 2 (which was delayed to October for a \"technical quality overhaul\" in response to early gameplay feedback), Crimson Desert, and Chucklefish's cozy new pixel RPG Witchbrook.\nAfter all, now that GTA 6 has been delayed to 2026, there's surely no time like the present for an avalanche of new release dates to help iron out the rest of our 2025 gaming calendars.\nThe road ahead\nI know, I know \u2013 that's a lot of games, and a lot of educated assumptions besides. Perhaps the most interesting potential third-party partner we might see at Xbox Games Showcase, though? Ubisoft.\nDespite being listed as a Summer Game Fest partner, the Assassin's Creed publisher has yet to confirm whether a Ubisoft Forward showcase will be going ahead. Bummed as I am at the prospect of waiting even longer for a look at Assassin's Creed: Codename Hexe, though, a cryptic tweet depicting an extreme close-up of Splinter Cell hero Sam Fisher's face has led many fans to believe that this could be a teaser for a long-awaited remake Ubisoft announced some four years ago.\nIf this is true, it could come at any point over the weekend's festivities \u2013 including the inaugural proceedings on June 6 \u2013 so it's definitely one for Xbox sleuths to watch for.\nAfter an impressive start to 2025, Xbox Games Showcase is Microsoft's chance to keep the good times rolling. It's an opportunity to impress console and PC gamers alike, not giving up on the strength and utility of its hardware even as console unit sales slow down, and prove that Xbox intends to carry this momentum into Q4 and beyond.\nIt'll be no small feat to draw attention away from the Switch 2 hype, but if Microsoft brings the goods I know it's well equipped to, the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 should be well worth postponing a Mario Kart World race for.\nTune into the Future Games Showcase on June 7 to check out a litany of brand new games on the way this year, hosted by Matt Mercer\nJasmine is a staff writer at GamesRadar+.

      "text": "Upcoming Switch 2 games for 2025 and beyond\nFrom Metroid to Elden Ring, here's all the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 games to look forward to in 2025\nThere are a ton of upcoming Switch 2 games to look forward to in the months ahead. Since the Switch 2's launch earlier this year, we saw a host of fantastic Switch 2 launch games arrive alongside it (including the likes of Mario Kart World). However, thanks to the most recent Nintendo Direct live stream and Indie Showcase, we now have several new games to add to our wishlists, such as Octopath Traveler 0.\nOn top of the slew of recent Switch 2 news, we also have the likes of a new Pok\u00e9mon game to look forward to, along with the return of some Kirby-shaped racing goodness and Samus' long-awaited comeback. In short, 2025 is a busy year for Nintendo fans, be they after new Switch 2 exclusives or exciting third-party releases on the new-gen console. But it's also tricky deciding where to spend your cash. So, that's where we come in.\nHere, we've brought together all of the confirmed new Switch 2 games headed our way, all in order of release date, so you can stay on top of the latest games set to come to Nintendo's latest console. And if you're looking for recommendations of what to play next while you wait for these new arrivals, be sure to check out our pick of the best Switch 2 games so far, too. Read on below to find our helpful roundup of all of the upcoming Switch 2 games.\nUpcoming Switch 2 games 2025\nEA SPORTS Madden NFL 26\nRelease date: August 11, 2025\nIf you are a fan of playing the best sports games around, then you'll be happy to know that EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 will be heading to the Switch 2 this August. This upcoming game will follow the same beloved formula from past Madden NFL titles, however, EA has stated that what makes NFL 26 stand out is its \"new AI-powered machine learning system trained by real play calls and game situations.\" Only time will tell to see if it's another winner or not, though.\nDrag x Drive\nRelease date: August 14, 2025\nDrag x Drive is an upcoming Switch 2 game that fully utilizes the console's new Joy-Con features. To play this sports game, you'll be using the controllers like a computer mouse, moving them on a flat surface in order to propel your wheelchair around the court. Zoom around the map to grab the ball from the opposing team, and then flick your controller in the air to try and score a point in their basketball hoop. It's a ball game that uses all the Joy-Con's capabilities!\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nStory of Seasons: Grand Bazaar\nRelease date: August 27, 2025\nThe Story of Seasons franchise is a Nintendo icon, so it makes sense that the latest remaster of one of the best 3DS games would be heading to the Switch 2. Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar will have you taking on the role as a farmer of the windy Zephyr Town. It's up to you to help the community and bring Zephyr back to its glory days. There's farming, crafting, and even some romance waiting you with this upcoming Switch 2 game, so be sure to mark your calendars for August.\nKirby and the Forgotten Land + Star Crossed World\nRelease date: August 28, 2025\nAs a Kirby superfan, I'm incredibly pleased to see that not only is Kirby and the Forgotten Land getting a fancy new Switch 2 Edition, but we're also going to see the new expansion Star Crossed World on the console as well. Forgotten Land is one of the best Kirby games ever made, so if you're new to the pink blob's franchise, it's a must-play!\nShinobi: Art of Vengeance\nRelease date: August 29, 2025\nShinobi: Art of Vengeance is a 2D action platformer that looks to be one of the most stylish upcoming Switch 2 games on our list.

Still, it now has a second chance on Nintendo's new console. Follow Kay Vess in a sci-fi adventure taking place in a vast open world filled with film easter eggs. It's wild to see the Switch 2 handle one of the most taxing sandbox games in recent years, especially when the Steam Deck struggled (often hitting sub-20 FPS lows).

      "text": "The Outer Worlds 2: Everything we know so far about Obsidian's new RPG\nWith an innovated perks and flaws system on the way, The Outer Worlds 2 wants you to play your way this October\nThe Outer Worlds 2 is set to bring us more Obsidian RPG goodness this year, with a release date firmly set for October. With more in-depth look at what's in store thanks to the likes of the Xbox Game Showcase 2025 earlier this year, which was immediately followed by a dedicated Direct that followed, we've gotten a much clearer picture of the sequel, which is set to be bigger in just about everyway to the 2019 RPG that came before it.\nIt's been a busy year for studio, with The Outer Worlds 2 now being the next major upcoming Obsidian game to follow the likes of Avowed which released back in February, and Grounded 2 which is set to land on July 29 in Early Access. But the expanded scope, suite of improvements, and quirky perks and flaws undoubtedly make the new sci-fi RPG one of the biggest new games for 2025.\nSet to come our way as one of the major upcoming Xbox Series X games, Obsidian also confirmed it will be coming to PC and PS5, too. From gameplay to trailers and more from the developers behind the adventure, there's a lot of exciting details out there about what's going to be store for us as we step into the world of Arcadia. For more on The Outer Worlds 2, read on below to get a full overview.\nThe Outer Worlds 2 release date confirmed\nThe Outer Worlds 2 release date is set for October 29, 2025.\nThe release date was officially confirmed during the Xbox Game Showcase 2025, with a new trailer dropping (which you can watch above) ahead of the dedicated Direct. The October date came after we got a 2025 launch window last year during The Game Awards 2024.\nWhile we await its arrival later this year, check out Obsidian's latest release with our Avowed review.\nThe Outer Worlds 2 trailers\nA new Outer Worlds 2 trailer dropped during The Game Awards 2024, and it finally gives us a look at the upcoming RPG's gameplay. With a funny voice-over accompanying the footage, we see some sci-fi player hubs, enemy encounters, tons of new shiny weapons, and some stunning environments. You can watch the clip for yourself above to see all the action play out.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nThis more action-packed trailer came after the initial Outer Worlds 2 reveal trailer dropped back in 2021, which you can see just below.\nThe Outer Worlds 2 setting\nThe Outer Worlds 2 is set in Arcadia, an \"isolated colony\" that's run by authoritarian faction called the Protectorate. As explained in The Outer Worlds 2 Direct, the faction's dictatorship is said to be thematically based around the question of \"how much freedom people give up for security and luxury\". Founded by the inventor of the skip drives, the Protectorate is incredibly wealthy too.\nAs an Earth Directorate agent, we've been sent here to examine what's going on with the aforementioned Skip Drives, which are starting to damage space-time in a way that's fast getting out of hand and causing rifts. Every faction has a different reason for closing the rifts for their own separate agendas.\nThe Outer Worlds 2 platforms\nThe Outer Worlds 2 is set to come to PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5. While it was thought to be an Xbox Series X exclusive, Obsidian revealed it will be also be landing PlayStation's console in our first proper look at the upcoming RPG back in December 2024.\nThe Outer Worlds 2 gameplay\nEverything we've seen of The Outer Worlds 2 gameplay shows it as generally bigger and far more fleshed out in scope than the first Outer Worlds in almost every respect, from the refined approach to the perks and flaws system to the scale of the star system we'll be venturing to. Factions and companions have also received a significant upgrade, with each faction having its own radio station and plenty of reactive adjustments to aid overall immersion in the RPG.\nDuring the extended deep dive Direct following Xbox Games Showcase, Obsidian walked us through its myriad gameplay tweaks - starting with the mechanics of shooting. Guns \"feel\" better in The Outer Worlds 2 \u2013 from recoil and snapping down sights, to sound effects, and there will be vast array of different ways to approach combat depending on the skills, flaws, and perks you pick that will allow you tailor your style - whether the be gung-ho with goopy explosives, going stealthy, and much more.\nThe sequel will also feature larger environments, with Obsidian setting out to \"encourage exploration with improved mobility across the board\". With the ability to run, slide, double-jump, and essentially parkour our way across \"nooks and crannies\" of the worlds we'll venture to. The game will also feature seamless first and third person perspective switches to really allow you to customize your experience.\nAs detailed in an IGN First preview earlier this year, The Outer Worlds 2 is also set to put a greater focus on Skills over Stats this time around, with 12 different skills in total that speak to your character's strengths - with the likes of Engineering and Hacking being among them. Traits will also be available which act apply permanent effects to your character that work in your favor, or be more negative in nature.\nYou'll also have different approaches in conversation, with certain parameters such as specific skills and traits to pass particular speech checks - not unlike the first game. The quest also involves a puzzle making use of a device known as the N-Ray scanning device, which lets you see through walls to detect enemies. It looks like we're going to have lots of different means to approach situations both in and out of combat, in true Obsidian RPG form.\nBoth the IGN First preview and the Direct also delved into the the return of perks and flaws. In terms of the former, Obsidian has revealed there will be over 90 different perks, but you won't be able to respect your character because your choices \"are permanent\". This has been done because, so that you really have to \"double down\" on your character and commit to the decisions you make.\nThe latter is also more responsive to the way you play this time around. In the early IGN preview, one example shows how players that skip dialogue often can offer up a flaw that requires you to get through conversations in a set amount of time if you want to avoid a penalty, while another in the Direct is Bad Knees, which sees players moving faster for the duration of the game with the snag that your creaking joints might break your stealth cover at any given time.\nCreative director Brandon Adler also spoke on the inspirations behind The Outer Worlds 2's gameplay in an interview with us here at GamesRadar+. As well as touching on the obvious influences of one of Obsidian's most beloved RPGs, Fallout: New Vegas, Adler also points to \"the newer Deus Ex games\".\nFor more, be sure to check out our The Outer Worlds 2 hands-on preview.\nThe Outworlds 2 weapons\nAlongside the dedicated The Outer Worlds 2 Direct, which confirmed gunplay has been improved in \"every way\", Obsidian also revealed it did a full breakdown of Destiny\" and got advice from the Halo team to make it feel even better this time around.\nWith a suite of improvements for aiming, reloading, and sound effects, the Direct also confirmed throwables will be introduced for the first time, with the likes of smoke grenades, distraction devices, and science grenades that can levitate enemies.\nFavorite weapons from the first game will be sticking around, with the Shrink Ray set to return in The Outer Worlds 2 - only instead of making an enemy smaller for a set amount of time, they'll stay downsized, which allows you kick or crush them.\nNew weapon types will be in the game, too, with a roster of inventive and wonderfully weird guns and melee weapons to wield in the sci-fi corporate-run universe. Various examples were given for some of the unique weapons we'll get to mess around - you can find the full list of new weapons confirmed so far below:\n- The Boarst Blaster - A big gun that fires out tumors that explode like grenades or be consumed for additional health\n- Rookie's Reward - A rifle-like gun that levels up the more you use it throughout the game, and each time it levels, it will shoot out confetti in a \"fun fanfare\" celebration\n- The Pop-Up Gun - Fires out ad drones to distract enemies with corporate slogans and jingles, and the drones can also be exploded\n- The Armageddon - A science weapon that fires out little arms that stick to surfaces or people and continue to hit what they've landed on\n- The Spectrum Dance Saber - a sword-like melee weapon that sees you attack to a musical beat and earn addition bonus for each hit you land in time\n- The Big Bang - A big gun that uses material harvested from rifts to shoot out a giant ball of energy that vaporizes everything in its path (ammo is extremely rare)\n- Gary - living science armor, when wearing Gary, he will lash out at foes\nCan I pre-order The Outer Worlds 2?\nThe Outer Worlds 2 is now available to pre-order across all platforms. Obsidian confirmed the upcoming sci-fi adventure can now be pre-ordered at the closing the Outer Worlds 2 Direct, with two different editions to choose from.\nThe Outer Worlds 2 standard edition costs $79.99 / \u00a369.99 and will come with a Commander Zane Anti-Monopolistic Battle Pack.\nThe Outer Worlds 2 premium edition clocks in at $99.99 / \u00a389.99 and will get you up to five days Early Access ahead of launch, the DLC pass for two future story expansions, and the Moon Man's Corporate Appreciation Premium Prize pack along with a digital artbook and soundtrack.\nWhile we wait for more The Outer Worlds 2 details, you can read our list of the best RPG games of all time if you fancy playing some classics.\nJosh West is the Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar+.

      "text": "Pokemon Legends Z-A: Everything we know so far about the upcoming Nintendo game\nPokemon Legends Z-A has been confirmed for Nintendo Switch 2 and is launching later this year!\nPokemon Legends Z-A is officially coming this year, with The Pokemon Company at last confirming an October release date for the RPG. This news comes after we got a hearty helping of gameplay footage earlier this year, with showcases revealing we'll be venturing back to the single-city setting of Lumiose, which previously appeared in Pokemon X and Y.\nFrom open-zone areas to real-time dodges and commands, and the return of Mega Evolutions for the first time in seven years, the April Nintendo Switch 2 Direct also confirmed the new adventure will be landing on the new-gen console as one of the many upcoming Switch 2 games. And excitingly, (thanks to the July Pokemon Presents showcase), we've also recently learned some story details and new features, such as Pokemon grooming, as well. It's all coming together, but with so much news, it's hard to keep on track with one of the most anticipated new games for 2025, not to mention one of the biggest upcoming Switch games on the horizon.\nTo make your life easier, we've gathered all the details into one handy guide for you. So, read on below as we take you through an overview of everything we know so far about Pokemon Legends Z-A.\nPokemon Legends: Z-A release date confirmed\nThe Pokemon Company has confirmed that Pokemon Z-A Legends release date will be October 16, 2025.\nThe official release date came in a press release from Nintendo, which at least gives us a concrete time frame following the \"late 2025\" window that was revealed previously.\nPokemon Legends: Z-A platforms\nPokemon Legends: Z-A will launch on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025, with the Switch 2 version being an Enhanced Edition, according to the March 2025 Nintendo Direct.\nIt's worth noting that The Pokemon Company has used slightly confusing language across its social channels, stating that Z-A is coming to \"Nintendo Switch systems.\" Following the reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2, a recent Nintendo Direct showcase confirmed that the upcoming Pokemon game will indeed be launching on past and current generations of its flagship console. Great news for anyone not looking to upgrade just yet!\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nPokemon Legends: Z-A trailer\nWe got our first proper trailer for Pokemon Legends: Z-A during the 2025 Pokemon Day showcase on February 27. In the clip, we see scenes of Pokemon having fun throughout Lumiose City - which is currently undergoing redevelopment to be a home for both trainers and Pokemon alike.\nWe also see the designated \"Wild Zones\" that exist in the metropolis, marked by green gates. Of course, we also see some battles, critter catching, and world exploration. It's classic Pokemon here, and we are excited to see more trailers drop in the future!\nYou can watch the Pokemon Legends: Z-A trailer above.\nPokemon Legends: Z-A gameplay\nThanks to the Pokemon Legends: Z-A trailers, we've now gotten multiple looks at the expected gameplay for the upcoming title. This includes its setting, which will be entirely within Lumiose City. This means that you're likely going to be unable to explore the wider Kalos Region. That's no doubt going to be a bit of a letdown for some of you Pokemon X and Y fans out there, but it does make sense, given the smaller scope of the Pokemon Legends series of titles.\nHowever, don't worry, there's still plenty to do. While in Lumiose City, your player character will be staying at a hotel named Hotel Z, which will be your base of operations as you tackle all sorts of incidents that will occur in the city. You'll be joining a team dedicated to protecting the city known as Team MZ. During the day, you can explore the city, diving into lush \"wild zones\" where you can catch some new party members and battle wild Pokemon.\nThe city is also filled with side-quests, including research objectives to complete for resident scientist Mable and detective quests to fulfill with the returning X and Y character Emma. The city is filled with customization options to such as Pokemon grooming and relaxation spots. However, during nighttime, you'll have to battle other trainers in the \"Z-A Royale\" system and make your way up through the ranks to progress the story. This comes with significant changes to the battling mechanics as well.\nAccording to the Pokemon website, in Pokemon Legends: Z\u2011A, \"Trainers and their Pokemon will move around in real-time during battles.\" There are also new features to consider when battling, such as the precise timing for swapping out your Pokemon, the different lengths of time moves will take, and how big an area the moves will impact.\" This will be the first battle system of its kind in a Pokemon game and will make combat a lot more of a strategic affair.\nNintendo also revealed that the title of the game actually references the new ranking system that's linked to the competitive battle zones. As trainers, we'll start out at rank Z and rise up to rank A, hence Z-A.\nPokemon Legends Z-A starters\nThe three Pokemon Legends Z-A starters are Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile.\nChikorita is the grass-type starter that was first introduced in Generation II. It is also one of the first three starters in Pokemon of Johto seen during Pokemon Gold and Silver. This grass type is described as having a gentle personality who loves sunbathing. So, if you love cozy, cute things, it'll be the perfect starter for you. Chikorita also evolves into Bayleef starting at level 16, which then evolves into Meganium (aka the most adorable and dinosaur-coded Pok\u00e9mon around) at level 32.\nTotodile is the water-type starter, which was also introduced in Generation II and, like Chikorita, was a starter during Pokemon Gold and Silver. This Pokemon has a rough personality and a tendency to bite, so be on the lookout for your fingers if you choose this critter as your first partner. Totodile evolves into Croconaw at level 18, which then evolves into Feraligatr starting at level 30.\nFinally, we have Tepig, the fire-type starter. Tepig was introduced during Generation V and was one of the starters available during Pokemon Black and White. Tepig loves finding food but has a habit of excitedly burning things when it's to worked up. Tepig evolves into Pignite at level 17, and then into Emboar starting at level 36.\nPokemon Legends: Z-A The Legendary Pokemon\nLegendary Pokemon will also be among the Pokemon Legends: Z-A Pokedex for all of us to meet when the game releases later this year. The one we know for sure is heading our way is Zygarde.\nZygarde was first introduced during the sixth generation as a dual-type Dragon/Ground Legendary Pok\u00e9mon and was a major player in the animated Pokemon the Series: XY.\nAccording to the Pokemon website, \"Zygarde is made up of a multitude of cell-like components, and it changes form depending on how many of these components have gathered together. Its brain is made up of the few existing Zygarde Cores, while the rest of its body is comprised of Zygarde Cells, which are far more plentiful. It seems to have taken a special interest in you... What could its connection to this story be?\"\nExpect Zygarde to be a massive part of the story of Pokemon Legends: Z-A. We may also see some possible connections to this legendary and the large corporation called Quasartico Inc. (that is re-developing Lumiose City). Stay tuned for updates!\nPokemon Legends: Z-A Mega Evolution explained\nPokemon Legends: Z-A Mega Evolution brings back a beloved feature first introduced in Pokemon X and Y that will boost your Pokemon's power and change their appearance. In Lumiose City, some Pokemon can go beyond normal evolution when they raise their levels in battle. Only a few Pokemon can Mega Evolve, and when they do, it temporarily unleashes the energy hidden within the Pokemon.\nWhen a trainer has a high bond with their partner, a Key Stone (worn by the Trainer) will resonate with the Pokemon's \"Mega Stone\" - that is what allows the evolution to take place. Below is a list of some of the confirmed Pokemon who can use Mega Evolution in Pokemon Legends: Z-A.\n- Mega Charizard X\n- Mega Charizard Y\n- Mega Dragonite\n- Mega Kangaskhan\n- Mega Ampharos\n- Mega Gardevoir\n- Mega Sableye\n- Mega Altaria\n- Mega Absol\n- Mega Lucario\nThe list above is expected to grow. And, in fact, according to leakers, 27 new Mega Evolutions could be added in the upcoming game. So far, in the series' history, we've had 48 Mega Evolutions. An additional 27 would bring the new total up to an impressive 75.\nHowever, before you get too excited about this news, keep in mind that nothing has been officially confirmed just yet. We'll keep you posted as more news heads our way!\nCan you pre-order Pokemon Legends: Z-A?\nYes! Pokemon Legends Z-A Pre-orders are live as of June 5, 2025. You can also currently wishlist the game on the Nintendo e-Shop now.\nFans can now pre-order both a digital and a physical copy of the game via the Nintendo e-Shop. Prices for the Switch version of the game are $59.99/\u00a349.99, while the Switch 2 versions will cost you $69.99/\u00a358.99. You'll also get a bonus item if you purchase the deal, which will be a \"Pokemon Legends: Z-A Partner Pokemon Figurine\", comprising the starters in the game.\nAnd, if you are a big collector and live in the UK, there are also Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Z-A Edition Mega Evolution bundles up for grabs for both the original Switch and the Switch 2. This bundle comes with the game, Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y figurines, and a pin set of the starters.\nIf you don't have a Switch 2 yet, you can also get a Pokemon Legends: Z-A bundle that includes the new game with the console for $499.99. Pre-orders for this bundle go live on July 23, 2025, in the UK. We are still waiting on US details, so stay tuned.\nWhile you wait for the game to arrive, check out our list of the best games like Pokemon to play today.\nIf you're looking for something else to tuck into while you wait, be sure to check out our pick of the best Switch 2 games.\nJosh West is the Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar+.

      "text": "Metal Gear Solid and Resident Evil Village stars set to host Future Games Show at Gamescom 2025\n\"I've had a sneak peek and the show is packed with world premieres, new trailers, and deep dives into some incredible games\"\nThe Future Games Show at Gamescom is being hosted by actors David Hayter and Maggie Robertson this year, best known for their roles as Metal Gear Solid's Snake and Resident Evil Village's Lady Dimitrescu.\nOver the course of Hayter's career, he's also nabbed screenwriting credits on Netflix's Warrior Nun and movies such as X-Men, X2: X-Men United, and Watchmen.

      "text": "Upcoming Obsidian games: Every new Obsidian game in development\nThe list of upcoming Obsidian games is small but mighty, with The Outer Worlds 2 leading the charge\nThe small list of upcoming Obsidian games marks exciting times ahead for any sci-fi and survival game fans. The developer is known for its storytelling, as well as creating adventures that are shaped by player choice, and now, with the recent release of Avowed, you may be wondering what's next. Well, thanks to the recent announcements made during Summer Game Fest 2025, we now have two of the most exciting sequels heading our way.\nIf you're unfamiliar with Obsidian, firstly, are you ok? And secondly, now is a great time to get up to speed with one of the most creative and personality-filled names in the gaming industry. Over the years, we've seen an increase in the studio's willingness to experiment and try new things, from the co-op experience Grounded to the stylized historical mystery Pentiment. Avowed was their last release, and the fantasy title has already established itself as one of the best games of 2025. However, it's just the start of a great year, as we know that Obsidian has a handful of the most exciting new games of 2025 in their back pocket.\nFrom updates around The Outer World's sequel to the big reveal of Grounded 2, there is a lot to keep track of. The Fallout New Vegas studio was acquired by Microsoft in 2018, meaning they are also some of the biggest upcoming Xbox games to keep an eye out for that will also be coming to Xbox Game Pass on Day One. So, for a full recap, read on below as we take you through all the upcoming Obsidian games on the way.\nUpcoming Obsidian games\nGrounded 2\nRelease date: July 29, 2025\nPlatform(s): PC, Xbox Series X\nShocking everyone, Grounded 2 was announced during the Xbox Games Showcase at Summer Game Fest 2025. Not only did we learn that we'll be able to dive into the sequel to one of the best survival games in Early Access in just a few weeks, but we were also treated to a separate direct that unveiled a ton of cool new features of the game. Set two years after the events of the original Grounded, our four teens are still missing and are still tiny. You'll have to navigate Brookhollow Park in order to uncover the community's secrets and get back home.\nThe upcoming game will introduce new creepy crawlies, such as cockroaches, new biomes, and mounts. Honestly, it looks fantastic and like another co-op winner. Keeping the typical Obsidian brand of humor and RPG elements alive as well, we've been teased with more story elements this time around. We'll keep you posted as soon as we hear more details.\nThe Outer Worlds 2\nRelease date: October 29, 2025\nPlatform(s): PC, Xbox Series X, PS5\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nThe Outer Worlds 2 was first officially announced back in 2021 with a brief teaser trailer that tapped into the first game's signature sense of humor. While it didn't reveal much beyond confirming the sequel's existence, we finally got a release date and an in-depth look at the upcoming game during Summer Game Fest 2025. In its own separate direct after the Xbox Games Showcase 2025, we got to see more RPG elements, fancy new weapons, and multiple comparisons to one of Obsidian's best games ever made, Fallout: New Vegas.\nIn terms of story, the action will take place in Arcadia; we'll be exploring a new colony as an Earth Directorate agent who's sent to investigate dangerous rifts. We'll also be meeting a fresh cast of companions who are all said to have dreams of their own - and whether you want to help them fulfill those dreams is up to you. You can expect to once again be able to shape your own adventure and character in what promises to be another choice-driven RPG from the studio.\nHere are the best Xbox Series X games to pick up while you wait for these Obsidian gems.

      "text": "Hollow Knight Silksong: Everything we know so far\nHollow Knight: Silksong rumblings are suddenly picking up again\nHollow Knight: Silksong is easily one of the most anticipated new games. In fact, the level of hype surrounding the long awaited sequel has only grow with each passing year.\nAnd the big summer summer of announcements only left us wanting more Hollow Knight Silksong, with Team Cherry's new roguelike getting a brief mention during Summer Game Fest Live 2025, before it was followed up by the reveal of the new Deadpool VR game. Then, it popped up during the reveal of the Asus ROG Ally, which was shown during the Xbox Games Showcase 2025.\nAlongside a massive Steam update just before the Summer Game Fest 2025 schedule kick off, we've only been fed small crumbs, but that hasn't made any of the excitement surrounding follow-up to one of the best Metroidvania games die down. We're still awaiting a major update from Team Cherry and that all important release date, but while we await further news, you can find a recap of all things Hollow Knight: Silksong below.\nThis Hollow Knight: Silksong hub was updated on July 21 to include any news.\nHollow Knight: Silksong news\n- Hollow Knight: Silksong dev simultaneously backtracks and doubles down on possible DLC, thinks \"DLC is likely\" despite his last apparent teaser being a joke\n- Hollow Knight: Silksong fans reach as-yet-unheard-of levels of cope as the Metroidvania's Nintendo Switch store page briefly disappears\n- The Hollow Knight: Silksong ARG turned out to be us clutching at straws, but dev says: \"the game is real, progressing and will release\"\n- 6 years and 1 prolonged delay later, Xbox is still calling \"incredible\" Hollow Knight: Silksong one of its \"upcoming games\"\n- Hollow Knight: Silksong developer teases us with a bunch of cryptic Nintendo Switch 2 clues including a cake, Imagine Dragons, and some Australian wine\n- Hollow Knight: Silksong fans tragically trolled by a random Steam update listed as \"for beta testing\"\n- Hollow Knight: Silksong is \"not in dev hell,\" says tester who finds fan cynicism \"disheartening\" but agrees developer Team Cherry \"should be better\" at communicating\n- Taking the mantle from Elden Ring fans, Hollow Knight Silksong hopefuls are going feral over the Metroidvania's first hidden Steam update in 14 months\n- As the wait for Silksong continues, Hollow Knight fans threaten to \"sacrifice\" their own forum to get the developer's attention\n- Hollow Knight Silksong's agonizingly long road to release might actually be an accidental stroke of genius\n- Hollow Knight Silksong community in shambles after finding something new in 4-year-old gameplay clips\nHollow Knight Silksong release date speculation\nThe Hollow Knight Silksong release date has yet to be revealed, but its appearance in a sizzle reel during the Switch 2 Direct in April reiterates a 2025 launch window.\nOriginally Silksong was set for an early 2023 target, before getting pushed back. Team Cherry's Matthew Griffin confirmed the initial delay back in the day, noting in a statement that while \"development is still continuing,\" the scope of the project requires more time. \"We're excited by how the game is shaping up, and it's gotten quite big, so we want to take the time to make the game as good as we can,\" added Griffin.\nIn March 2025, we also heard word from a brief teaser from Xbox that Silksong is still counted as one of its upcoming games to look forward to. In this statement, the game was next to a collection of 2025 titles. So, while we don't have a firm date yet, it seems like Silksong is still on its way and the Nintendo appearance seems to reinforce the year window. Fingers crossed we get a late-2025 release window in the future.\nHollow Knight Silksong platforms\nThe Hollow Knight: Silksong platforms have been confirmed as Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, and PC \u2013 via Steam, GOG, and the Humble Store.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nFollowing the Switch 2 Direct in April 2025, it was clarified that Silksong will be coming to Nintendo's current and next-gen consoles, which is certainly exciting for those planning to get their hands on a Switch 2 this year.\nAdditionally, Team Cherry has confirmed that a Hollow Knight: Silksong Xbox Game Pass release has been secured, meaning it'll be available to all subscribers on the day of release.\nWill Hollow Knight: Silksong be on PS4 or PS5?\nEver since Team Cherry announced this sequel back in 2019, PlayStation owners have been left asking the same question: Will Hollow Knight Silksong be on PS4 and PS5? And for the longest time it looked uncertain, especially after Xbox owners learned that the game would be coming to Xbox Game Pass. Thankfully, PlayStation has since cleared up any confusion. The platform holder took to Twitter to confirm that Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on PS5 and PS4.\nHollow Knight Silksong trailer\nAbove you can watch the debut Hollow Knight: Silksong reveal trailer, which Team Cherry used to announce the game to the world for the very first time all the way back in February 2019.\nThe two-minute trailer began with Hornet's kidnapping, showing her breaking free to explore lush meadows and dank underground passageways. The trailer showed there are new enemies to conquer, new bosses to fight, brand new friends to meet along the way, and new towns to explore, complete with NPC characters and their associated quests.\nAnd now we have this second Hollow Knight: Silksong gameplay trailer to pour over from E3 2022. More gameplay sneak peeks, more bosses and bad guys, and more from our old pal Hornet \u2013 who's been promoted from friend and foe of the original game to playable hero.\nHollow Knight Silksong gameplay\nAs for Hollow Knight: Silksong's gameplay, initially the only footage we had to go off was from the debut trailer. Despite it being a pure introduction to the sequel, we actually did get to see plenty of clips of protagonist Hornet jumping into action, as she bounds and leaps over enemies with finesse. And now that's been solidified and built upon by the more recent trailer, with everything looking incredibly fluid.\nIt\u2019s clear then that Hollow Knight's blend of platforming and 2D combat is returning for Silksong. In fact, Team Cherry looks to have made the platforming distinctly more acrobatic with Hornet than with the Knight in the original game: the new protagonist looks like a gymnast compared to the Knight, deftly flipping over huge enemies with ease.\nHealing also works differently in Silksong than in Hollow Knight. Instead of slowly refilling her health like the Knight did, Hornet can instantly heal three health nodes, and not only that, but she can also do this on the move. However, Hornet has a Silk metre, and healing three nodes of health immediately empties the bar.\nHollow Knight Silksong story\nIf you've played Hollow Knight, you'll no doubt remember Hornet, who frequently got in the way of the player character, but ended up becoming their ally partway through. Hollow Knight: Silksong actually switches out protagonists, replacing the Knight with Hornet for this new adventure.\nIn this new game, Hornet finds herself kidnapped, and spirited away to a kingdom called Pharloom. Said to be \"haunted by Silk and Song\" according to developer Team Cherry themselves, Silksong's basic plot puts Hornet right at the bottom of this new kingdom, and tasks her with ascending to the top of the kingdom and reaching a shining citadel to find out the truth behind her kidnapping.\nAdditionally, there's also going to be side quests for Hornet to take on. These sound a lot more fleshed out than in the original Hollow Knight, as Silksong actually allows you to keep track of all your side quests in a journal. Perhaps this is an opportunity to tell more stories outside of the main plot of Silksong.\nHollow Knight Silksong development\nHollow: Knight: Silksong actually began development as another DLC chapter for the original Hollow Knight. Set to star Hornet, developer Team Cherry quickly realized the scope of the DLC was far bigger than they anticipated, so they actually carved out the space for a full-blown sequel starring Hornet instead.\nLooking at the sequel now, it's not hard to see why. Hollow Knight: Silksong's debut trailer boasted of over 150 brand new enemies, including new bosses to fight in addition to this. In fact, there's brand new features for the sequel, like the ability to craft weapons, tools, and traps from materials gathered off of fallen enemies.\nIf you liked the music of the original game, then we've got good news for you. Original composer Christopher Larkin has returned to collaborate with Team Cherry to score Hollow Knight: Silksong, which means the new adventure promises to have memorable tunes for punchy moments.\nCan't stand the wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong? Then you might want to check out one of the best roguelike games, or even some of the fantastic games like Hollow Knight that are out there just waiting to be played today.\nHirun Cryer is a freelance reporter and writer with Gamesradar+ based out of U.K. After earning a degree in American History specializing in journalism, cinema, literature, and history, he stepped into the games writing world, with a focus on shooters, indie games, and RPGs, and has since been the recipient of the MCV 30 Under 30 award for 2021.

      "text": "Grounded 2: Everything you need to know about the new survival game\nGrounded 2 is now out in Early Access, so here's all the latest news before you dive into a new bug-filled adventure\nGrounded 2 is finally out in Early Access, and already we can't get enough of the bug-filled title. The sequel to Obsidian's 2022 survival adventure was first revealed during the Summer Game Fest 2025 schedule, which brought us a reveal trailer along with an extended Direct showcase that gave us an in-depth look at Grounded 2, alongside the other big upcoming Obsidian game, The Outer Worlds 2.\nWe've had a chance to play the new game (check out our Grounded 2 review for more details on that), and it's already a blast. Taking a Bug's Life-like adventure with Honey I Shrunk the Kids vibes, everything has been scaled up to be bigger and better in the sequel, with a new environment, more foes to face, mounts, and more. But those who love Grounded need not fear, since Obsidian has also assured fans the first game is here to stay following the release of the follow-up. And since it's one of the best survival games we've seen in recent times, it's great to know the first game will be preserved even as we step into something new with Grounded 2.\nBelow, you'll find everything you need to know about what looks set to be one of the biggest upcoming Xbox Series X games on the near horizon. From its features to its reveal trailer and much more, read on below to get an overview on all things Grounded 2!\nGrounded 2 release date\nThe good news is that Grounded 2 has now launched into Xbox Game Preview and Steam Early Access as of July 29, 2025. This big news was revealed during the recent Xbox Games Showcase 2025 as part of Summer Game Fest, and shocked everyone.\nThe first Grounded was announced back in 2019, and then went into Early Access in 2020 before getting a full release in 2022. So far, it's unclear when exactly the sequel will have its full release. Obsidian currently plans to follow the same window as the first Grounded, which stayed in Early Access for two years following its initial launch.\nGrounded 2 platforms\nGrounded 2 is currently only available to play on Xbox Series X and PC in its Early Access state.\nRight now, there is no word on a PS5 or Nintendo release. However, before you start lamenting about owning the wrong console, it's worth keeping in mind that in 2024, the first Grounded was released on the Switch, PS4, and PS5, and Obsidian has even stated that is isn't ruling out PS5, but says that Grounded 2's initial release is \"all about being in Game Preview and Early Access\".\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nSo, the sequel could follow in Grounded's footsteps and make its way to other consoles in the future. Who knows, maybe we'll see it added to our list of upcoming Switch 2 games as well! For now, though, it's looking to be an Xbox exclusive at launch. And while the original game landed on the Xbox One, Obsidian explained that Grounded 2 was born out of the limitations of the last-gen console, with the sequels world being created from \"ground-up\" for the Xbox Series X.\nGrounded 2 trailer\nThe first Grounded 2 trailer (which you can watch above) gave us our first look at the bigger setting we'll be exploring and venturing across in the upcoming sequel, with the small heroes running across everything from a spilled ice cream tub to a giant juice carton in the park.\nWe also get some story hints, which all kick off after a news segment announces that there has been an explosion at BrookHollow Park during a ceremony that celebrated the two-year anniversary of four teens being minaturized against their will. Ominet is also mentioned as it's revealed that the teens are missing once again.\nFinally, the trailer also showed off probably Grounded 2's biggest new feature: mounts. There are tons of clips of teens riding spiders, ants, and more. It's all very exciting, and we can't wait to find out more about the story as well as tame some giant creepy crawlies.\nGrounded 2 story and setting\nGrounded 2 is set a few years after the events of the first game in the year 1992, and will follow the story of the four original teens who are still missing.\nIf you're unfamiliar with the story of the first Grounded, basically, you are one of four teens who find themselves mysteriously shrunken down to the size of an insect and trapped in a backyard. As they explore and try to survive the brutal environment of the yard, they discover notes from Dr. Wendell Tully, who invented the machine known as SPAC.R, which can shrink objects and people.\nIt turns out that you are, in fact, in Dr. Wendell Tully's yard, and so is the SPAC.R. Thanks to an explosion, the pieces are scattered, and you must find them all to get back to normal. Along the way, it's discovered that the company Ominent is behind your kidnapping and has been experimenting on children.\nIn Grounded 2, Ominent is back in full force and up to shady antics once again. During the Xbox Showcase at Summer Game Fest 2025, we learned the company seems to be back to its old tricks, and it's up to you to survive whatever they throw at you. In fact, you'll have to find more Ominent research labs to progress the game too, so expect to discover some more secrets there.\nIn the Grounded 2 Direct following the Xbox Game Showcase, the development team at Eidos Montreal and Obsidian Entertainment also revealed the world of 2 is larger than the first, and will take place in Brookhollow Park, which has new biomes, from the likes of an icy environment that takes the form of an overturned ice-cream cart that's contents has spilled out, as well as a \"spooky\" anthill.\nSpeaking with GamesRadar+ during the Summer Game Fest event, Obsidian co-founder and Grounded 2 director Chris Parker explained how the technical limitations of the Xbox One influenced the decision to build an expanded world from the ground up for the second game on the current-gen Xbox Series X/S.\nGrounded 2 gameplay\nMuch like its predecessor, Grounded 2 is primarily a survival game that will have you scavenging a gigantic world for materials, as you loot bug corpses, dive into dungeons, craft shelters, and unlock upgrades that turn you into a tiny insect terminator.\nLike the first game, as you progress the story through exploring research labs and battling massive boss bugs, you'll get to unlock technology and equipment that helps you survive as well as thrive in your shrunken state. Not only will you need to stay alive with all the creepy crawlers after you, but you'll have to manage your hunger and thirst levels as well.\nStamina also depletes during combat, and a nighttime cycle will make enemies more aggressive, so keep that in mind when you're out and about looking for resources. Like the first game, co-op is also a big gameplay feature, giving you the opportunity to play with your mates (or use them as a shield when fighting those giant bugs). The game can be played solo, though, so don't worry, no matter what kind of player you are, you are sorted here.\nAnd while everything is set to be bigger in scale in the future follow-up, Obsidian also revealed that it never considered stretching beyond four player co-op, because it would have \"undermined what Grounded was really about\". What truly makes Grounded stand out among other titles in the survival genre is its RPG-like quirks. Action is expected to be split up with witty dialogue from NPCs, and you'll cover tidbits of lore as you make your way through the game and work to survive as a mini-person just trying their best.\nDuring the Grounded 2 Direct, we also learned more about new gameplay features, including the fact that we'll be able to dash this time around, but so can all of the enemies we face, with the reveal that we'll also be facing cockroaches.\nExcitingly, the upcoming sequel will additionally feature mounts known as buggies that give us a new way to traverse and explore the world, and they'll fight alongside you when you jump off of them. In fact, Obsidian said it to rethink how the world works in Grounded 2 because bringing mounts to the sequel was such a big change.\nYou can read more about the expanded scope of the upcoming survival adventure in our Grounded 2 hands-on preview. Or, if you want to get a head start on your first playthrough, check out our guides on the Grounded 2 Acorn locations and the Grounded 2 Grass Seeds location.\nCan I pre-order Grounded 2?\nSorry, folks, but you can't pre-order Grounded 2 just yet. However, considering how the game is now out in Early Access, that may change soon once we get word on a full release date.\nYou can now wishlist the game on both Steam and the Microsoft Store, so at least that's something! We'll keep you posted as we wait for more updates. In the meantime, you can read our original Grounded review to prepare yourself before the sequel hits.\nFor more adventures with friends, check out our list of the best co-op games to play today.

      "text": "Predicting the games of Summer Game Fest 2025: What we expect to see from each of the 20 major publishers in attendance\nWith Summer Game Fest 2025 nearly here, let's get expectations in order with a list of all our predictions for the showcases\nSummer Game Fest 2025 is almost here, due to begin on June 6, and the sun is shining and ready for heaps of the hottest gaming news! In advance of the major press conferences and showcases from the biggest platform holders and publishers, we're ready to kick off our coverage of one of the spiciest events of the year.\nWith E3 2025 remaining an impossibility \u2013 the once great annual event now fallen by the way side in favor of SGF, the Summer Game Fest 2025 schedule is the new tome to follow \u2013 the likes of Xbox, Steam, PlayStation and Nintendo are present, bringing info on the new games of 2025 and beyond! Over the decades, it's events like these that are lynchpins of the gaming calendar, and really show what the future of gaming will bring across specific announcements, yes, but also highlight the trends that will continue to shape the industry. The countdown to Summer Game Fest 2025 starts here!\n2K\nWhile we may be treated to updates and announcements surrounding 2K's premier sports titles such as WWE 2K25, NBA 2K, and more \u2013 the publisher has some real big adventures on the way. We expect Borderlands 4 to steal the show, the upcoming zany sci-fi co-op shooter looking set to bring the looter back to its roots in a big way as soon as September 12. Only a few months ahead of release, it should be a blow out. Additionally, Mafia: The Old Country is releasing even sooner \u2013 August 8 \u2013 and promises to be a focused single-player story experience. We're salivating to find out more about what that means. We'd also love to finally see something from the long-awaited BioShock 4\u2026 could this be the time? Just don't expect much more from GTA 6 though, Rockstar marches to its own drum, and we just got a massive new GTA 6 trailer for that as well as a delay to 2026.\n505 Games\nIf our Blades of Fire review is any indication, 505 Games is in a really solid place right now with their slate of published games. While you can always expect plenty in the pipeline from them (I'd already be eager to get some Blades of Fire DLC, but I may be dreaming), it's Wuchang: Fallen Feathers that's they're next big release. If they're at the show, they're bound to be telling us more about this huge title from Leenze. Inspired by Chinese mythology, it aims to use the setting to offer a new twist on the soulslike genre, and it's shaping up to be seriously impressive so far.\nBandai Namco\n2025 has already been a big year for Bandai Namco, but the publisher still has some absolute mammoths on the near horizon, and we expect to hear at least some news for the long-awaited Little Nightmares 3. Currently, the Supermassive Games title is slated to launch in 2025, so it's more than possible that a release date gets announced during a showcase. The same could be said for Digimon Story: Time Stranger, which similarly only has a 2025 release window at the moment. As massive RPG fans, we're hopeful for something The Blood of Dawnwalker shaped as well, but considering that game was only announced in January this year, it may not make the showcase cut.\nBlumhouse Games\nBlumhouse Games may be a relatively young publisher (having only been founded in 2023), however, it currently has five games in development, and we're betting that we'll see at least a handful during Summer Game Fest. If you're a cozy gamer, chances are that you've heard of Grave Seasons (a farming life sim with a serial killer twist). The game was announced in June last year, so we're due an update, and we expect to see it during either the Wholesome Direct or the PC Gaming Show. Fingers crossed, we get more insights into Blumhouse Games' other horror titles as well in the later showcase, looking at you, Project C.\nCapcom\nResident Evil 9 would be the dream, we know. However, looking closer to reality, it's more likely that Capcom's involvement in the Summer Game Fest will center around its 2026 title that was announced at the end of last year. We're talking about Onimusha: Way of the Sword, the upcoming entry to the samurai Onimusha series. It's also possible that Capcom may be in the lineup due to Nintendo. Street Fighter 6 is a Switch 2 launch title, and we could be seeing more of it as it's one of the best offerings for the upcoming console. Personally, we're hoping for some Okami 2 news, since that was also revealed last year. Fingers crossed that Capcom meets all our high expectations.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nCD Projekt\nIn terms of upcoming CD Projekt Red games, let's be honest, The Witcher 4 is going to be the star of the day. We got our first trailer for the new RPG during the Game Awards 2024 livestream, though we still don't know a release window. The publisher are teaming up with Unreal to present more on the game at the engine's own showcase event, State of Unreal where they will be \"showcasing some of the innovative technology & features that will power The Witcher 4, and beyond\". Cyberpunk 2077: Orion (the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel) also recently got a pre-production update, so there's a chance it'll make an appearance in some capacity as well.\nDevolver Digital\nDevolver Digital actually has a lot going on currently in terms of games in active development, so we expect to see quite a few offerings from the publisher pop up throughout Summer Game Fest. Since Nintendo is going to be involved, we're betting that the upcoming Switch 2 game, Enter the Gungeon 2, gets some kind of news (hopefully a release window). Skate Story is also overdue for an update and still needs a 2025 release date. Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions is also another cross-platform 2026 outing that has a lot of eyes on it, so we wouldn't be shocked to see it appear in some capacity as well. However, Devolver Digital is known for throwing wild curveballs, so potentially we could be looking at some fresh, never-before-seen indie announcements as well. Devolver Digital is always a fun wild card after all.\nDotemu\nIn terms of SGF partners, Dotemu is definitely one of the smaller ones in terms of games in development. However, although the line-up isn't massive, it does come with one of our most anticipated upcoming Marvel games and a new outing in the iconic Ninja Gaiden series. Marvel Cosmic Invasion was recently announced to be heading our way sometime in 2025, as was the 2D platformer Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound. We'll likely see both of these titles at some point, hopefully with release dates in hand. However, at least we can rest easy knowing that there will be plenty of pixelated beat em up action, regardless. I mean, what else could you expect from ninjas and superheroes, right?\nIO Interactive\nProject 007 has a new title \u2013 007: First Light, and is set to receive its full reveal this week. No doubt, this is tying into Summer Game Fest. The dev studio already mastered assassination espionage with Hitman, so we're shaken, stirred and everything in between to see how they tackle the good guy spy himself. Also, it's easy to take the series for granted following the release of Hitman 3, but the whole Hitman World of Assassination package does continue to update and do quite well. This year is a big moment for it as well, as it'll be coming to Nintendo Switch 2 allowing players to take their hits on the go. It might even end up being one of our favorite Nintendo Switch 2 games if it comes out well.\nMundfish\nThe release of Atomic Heart must have gone well, because the developer just announced a publishing arm \u2013 Mundfish Powerhouse \u2013 that aims to help other developers get their games out there and breakthrough to audiences. Alongside the announcement, the developer also revealed Atomic Heart broke through 10 million players in total \u2013 not too bad. Given the SGF partnership, we'll likely hear more about the Powerhouse initiative, and what games they have planned for their first wave of publishing.\nNeowiz\nWe really enjoyed this developer's Pinocchio-inspired take on soulslikes in our Lies of P review back in 2023. The studio has continued to bring updates to the adventure since release, and we're now barrelling close to the Summer 2025 launch window for its major Lies of P: Overture DLC which brings a new chapter as well as difficulty options. Summer Game Fest 2025 will be occurring over, well, the summer \u2013 so expect to hear more about the DLC. We'd also love to hear what Neowiz has planned next, but we understand they'll want to focus on tying the bow on Lies of P so far.\nNintendo Switch 2\nConsidering the Nintendo Switch 2 itself launches on June 5, its early launch days overlap with Summer Game Fest 2025 directly \u2013 which makes me anxious just to type out. Regardless, expect plenty of information on the launch lineup from the show, detailing the likes of Mario Kart World for those still on the fence about purchasing. While there's certainly lots of announcements Nintendo could make about the year ahead for the hardware, it's the imminent release of Donkey Kong Bananza that's sure to be in the spotlight, given its July 17 launch date. As the big new open world platforming adventure, this feels like the biggest showpiece for the system at the moment in general.\nPearl Abyss\nThe Black Desert Online developers have more than a few new project irons in the fire, so to speak. The colorful monster catching DokeV hasn't had an update in so long it feels like it's due for a bit of a re-reveal, but we're not holding our breath. More imminent is Crimson Desert, which has been making the rounds at various showcases before SGF 2025. A single-player open world medieval-style fantasy adventure, what we've seen has been breathtaking, and the boss fights we've gone hands-on with have showcased twitchy combat. We're still waiting to see how it'll all come together, and waiting for a firm release date. Here's hoping we find all that out and more come SGF 2025.\nPlayStation\nThere's so much coming up for PlayStation that we're desperate to hear more about, but let's at least try to begin realistically. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach from Kojima Productions is sure to have a final big showcase ahead of its June 26 release date. Likewise, Ghost of Yotei, from Sucker Punch Productions \u2013 the sequel to Ghost of Tsushima \u2013 is creeping ever closer to its October 2 launch, and we're due a deeper dive into the systems in a showcase at some point soon. It also feels like Saros, Housemarque's spiritual successor to Returnal, could put in an appearance. Whether Marathon will be there, given the recent scandals around its art, remains to be seen.\nFurther off, but still possible, is Intergalatic: The Heretic Prophet, Naughty Dog's latest which looks to be a departure from The Last of Us and Uncharted \u2013 but it may be too early to see more on this yet. Also, given how much we loved Insomniac Games' latest in our Spider-Man 2 review, we're desperate for more from them, especially when it comes to Marvel's Wolverine. Likewise, co-op heister Fairgames remains a bit of a mystery, as do several unannounced projects from some of their top studios like God of War: Ragnarok developer Sony Santa Monica Studio, or what's next to followup on Horizon Forbidden West from Guerilla Games.\nSega\nSega have so many games cooking it's hard to know where to begin, while at the same time feeling due to announce some kind of higher profile spotlight game. Could we get a new Sonic platformer? Yakuza 9? Skies of Arcadia Re-Legended? (Okay, let me have one spot to manifest). One thing is clear, Sega are big supporters of the Switch 2, with launch games Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S and Yakuza 0: Director's Cut releasing imminently, and the likes of sort-of-Persona-spin-off Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army getting a remaster that'll also be on the system.\nBeyond Switch 2, Sonic is still doing his thing. The actually-quite-good-looking Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is due in 2025, so expect more details on that. On the smaller screen, Sonic Rumble is meant to be coming to mobile \u2013 but was recently delayed \u2013 and Persona 5: The Phantom X is also set to finally release in English soon. Meanwhile, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance will be the first in Sega's series of legacy revivals, coming 29 Aug. Will we finally see more from Jet Set Radio, Golden Axe, Crazy Taxi, and Streets or Rage as well?\nSquare Enix\nFor such a huge publisher, there's actually a lot up in the air with Square Enix at the moment, so it'd be great to get a firmer picture for how its biggest series are looking to evolve next. Namely, with Kingdom Hearts Missing Link for mobile cancelled and a recent new glimpse at Kingdom Hearts 4, are we due a bit of a blowout for the Disney crossover RPG? It'd be great to get some more news on what's next for Final Fantasy, be it the surely-on-the-way Final Fantasy 17 and Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3, which will close out the redo trilogy. Other than that, Dragon Quest 1 & 2 HD-2D Remake, which we enjoyed going hands-on with, will likely put in an appearance ahead of its October 30 release.\nSteam\nCould it be? Is it finally time for Half-Life 3!? Probably not. But, well, we can dare to dream. We're a little unsure quite what Steam themselves may be doing at SGF 2025, but if we had to put money on it we'd bet they don't have much in terms of games software, but perhaps hardware instead. The SteamDeck seems to have been a success \u2013 we certainly loved the hardware in our Steam Deck OLED review \u2013 and it'd make sense that Steam as a platform may continue in this direction. Never a company to silo themselves, it's likely more 'portable PC' devices may partner with Steam to bring its OS to devices.\nSupermassive Games\nThe stalwart horror developer who ran screaming into our hearts with Until Dawn continues to release some solidly spooky games, and they've got two upcoming that are sure to be represented at SGF 2025 that we can't wait to see more about. Directive 2080 is a sci-fi thriller that looks more than a little chilling, and is the latest in their Dark Pictures anthology of frights (though the series' titling is now \u2013 and perhaps wisely \u2013 minimized). They're also working on Little Nightmares 3, a standalone third entry in the uneasy platforming series, picking up the reins from creators Tarsier Studios (who are working on their own new thing: Reanimal).\nTechland\nParkour-centric zombie series Dying Light continues to be a delight, and the developer has a followup to 2022's Dying Light 2 due later this year: Dying Light: The Beast. Seeing the return of original protagonist Kyle Crane, this started development as DLC before transforming into its own thing. Likewise, Kyle can now transform, using his titular beast powers to dominate the forested environment like we've never been able to in the series before. Beyond this, Techland is also working on some not-quite announced projects like a fantasy game \u2013 but we'd expect them to remain focused on telling us more about Dying Light: The Beast for now.\nXbox\nThe platform holder isn't just at Summer Game Fest 2025, but has a whole Xbox Games Showcase airing on June 8. We'll be digging deep into everything Xbox is bringing, but it'll be a fascinating time to get to grips with where Xbox is in the industry at the moment. Rumors abound about all sorts, including the possibility of new hardware \u2013 though it sounds like that might not be kicking around this year after all. But, anything can be an Xbox now, or so they say.\nIn terms of games, Xbox have just come off releasing Doom: The Dark Ages through Bethesda. The big new release this time around will be The Outer Worlds 2, as Xbox have already announced it'll receive a dedicated Direct following the broader showcase. We're also hoping Xbox Game Studios will tell us more about Gears of War: E-Day, State of Decay 3, Clockwork Revolution, and Perfect Dark \u2013 which feel like they're due more info soon. Further off, and games we'd really love to hear more about but have been light on info for a while are the Fable reboot, Marvel's Blade, Everwild, and The Elder Scrolls 6. They've got to tell us more sometime, right?\nFor more future releases, check out our guides on all the upcoming PS5 games and upcoming Xbox Series X games.\nGames Editor Oscar Taylor-Kent brings his year of Official PlayStation Magazine and PLAY knowledge. A noted PS Vita apologist, he's also written for Edge, PC Gamer, SFX, Official Xbox Magazine, Kotaku, Waypoint, GamesMaster, PCGamesN, and Xbox, to name a few.

Rarely focused entirely on the new, the call to return to retro is constant, whether that's a quick evening speed through Sonic 3 & Knuckles or yet another Jakathon through Naughty Dog's PS2 masterpieces.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "Metroid Prime 4: Beyond \u2013 Everything we know so far about the upcoming Switch game\nMetroid Prime 4 is landing on Nintendo Switch in 2025, and Samus' return looks well worth the wait\nMetroid Prime 4: Beyond is at last set to arrive this year after being the works for a number of years. First revealed with a very brief teaser back in 2017, Samus' upcoming return in a fresh adventure was even rebooted and changed hands over the course of development, but from what's been shown so far, it looks like it's going to be worth the wait.\nWith recent showcases - such as the April Nintendo Switch 2 Direct and a Nintendo Treehouse stream - giving us some proper insight into the direction of the new Metroid Prime entry, we've gotten to see its Star Wars-style opening cutscene, alongside confirmation that it's going to be among the lineup of upcoming Switch 2 games set to come our way that will make use of the new-gen console's unique mouse controls in a\nWe're still awaiting that all important release date, but it's already shaping up to be one of the biggest new games for 2025, and rumors are already doing the rounds that we may well see of the upcoming adventure very soon. But with Retro Studios at the helm of the game and plenty of details now out in wild about what's in store, read on below to find out more about all things Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.\nMetroid Prime 4: Beyond release date speculation\nNintendo has confirmed that the Metroid Prime 4: Beyond release date will be set for sometime in 2025, although the publisher is yet to confirm a firm date.\nIn June, there were unconfirmed reports that an advert for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was spotted in the London Underground with the information \"out now\" on the poster. The tube station that was reportedly running the AD was Oxford Circus Station; however, before we all start yelling \"it must have shadow dropped,\" Metroid Prime 4 isn't out yet, folks. If the advert was real, it was simply a mistake, as there is still no way to get your hands on the game yet.\nPokemon Legends Z-A coming in October and Donkey Kong Bananza now out as of July 17, we are betting on a November release, or possibly a December one for the holidays. We'll keep you posted as soon as we know more.\nMetroid Prime 4: Beyond platforms\nMetroid Prime 4 is set to land on Switch and will also be coming to the Switch 2.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 Direct confirmed Metroid Prime: 4 Beyond will be getting a Switch 2 Edition release alongside its launch on Switch. This version will run on the new-gen console with two different available modes: Quality mode runs at 4K 60FPS, while Performance mode runs at 1080p at 120FPS.\nMetroid Prime 4: Beyond trailer\nThe latest Metroid Prime 4 trailer debuted during the March 2025 Nintendo Direct. In this new teaser, we see Samus navigating the jungle planet of Viewros, where she must explore and scan mysterious statues to escape.\nHowever, Samus isn't alone and the trailer shows us plenty of exciting new enemies for us to blast. But, one of the most curious bits of information shared during this teaser is Samus' new psychic powers. The clip shows off abilities that will fling players towards enemies and assist in navigating the map as you can unlock doors.\nWhile that may sound like a big departure from the series, worry not! The trailer also has us occupying a first-person perspective as Samus navigates hostile environments, bringing back the FPS stylings of Metroid Prime 3 as she guns down enemies, and scans the corpses.\nMetroid Prime 4 screenshots\nNintendo released new Metroid Prime 4: Beyond screenshots. You can see these by scrolling through the gallery above, which should give you a good sense of the visual fidelity Nintendo is striving to deliver for this Switch release. You'll see Samus in combat with Space Pirates, some beautiful new environments, and get a glimpse at some returning abilities.\nMetroid Prime 4: Beyond gameplay\nThe Metroid Prime 4: Beyond gameplay experience is going to be a delicate blend of quiet exploration, puzzle solving, and frantic shootouts, something the best Metroid games always capture with ease. You see these sides of play represented in the reveal trailer: Samus using her Scan Visor to assess the environment and gather information, shifting into her Morph Ball to explore new areas of the environment, and blasting away Space Pirates with her Power Beam and Missile Launcher.\nDuring a recent Nintendo Direct, we also saw that psychic abilities will be a new feature in the gameplay. You'll be able to use these powers to solve puzzles around the map, and control beams as you face off against enemies. From the most recent trailer for Metroid Prime 4, these new abilities will play a large part in the story, too.\nThe Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Switch 2 Edition will also make use of the Switch 2's new Joy-Con controller mouse-function, for more \"intuitive gameplay\". We saw during the Direct Showcase how this can be effectively used to direct and aim Samus' arm canon.\nIf you're looking to get a better idea of how Metroid Prime 4: Beyond may play, be sure to check out our glowing Metroid Prime Remastered review - which should convince you to pick up the classic!\nMetroid Prime 4 powers and abilities\nThere's still plenty more we need to learn about the game, but there's already some details that can be gleaned from the gameplay and trailers we've seen so far to pick out all the returning powers and abilities in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond:\n- Power Suit\n- Power Beam\n- Missile Launcher\n- Morph Ball\n- Scan Visor\n- Psychic Abilities\nMetroid Prime 4 story\nThe Metroid Prime 4: Beyond story is still tightly under wraps, although we do know the general premise thanks to a recent Nintendo Treehouse presentation.\nThe game opens with Samus being tasked by the Galactic Federation to protect and defend an artifact from Space pirates. While trying to complete that objective, she sees that Metroids have seemingly teamed up with the game's main antagonist, Sylux, with the bounty hunter reappearing after their showing in Metroid Prime Hunters.\nWhile we are unsure about what happens next, we do know that the artifact will end up sending Samus to a new world. In previous trailers, we know that Samus will be trapped on an alien Jungle planet called Viewros. And after interacting with some statues, we also know that she'll be granted some ancient powers that give her psychic abilities. While we are still unclear on how she was trapped or why, Metroid Prime 4's story will focus on Samus trying to escape her current situation and get off this strange planet.\nWe're curious to discover more, especially regarding this uneasy alliance between the Space Pirates and Metroids.\nMetroid Prime 4's Sylux explained\nRetro Studios has confirmed that Sylux will play a massive role in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, but who is this mysterious character? Little is known about this powerful bounty hunter, and that's despite multiple appearances in the series. So here's what I can tell you: Sylux carries a strong distrust of the Galactic Federation and views Samus Aran as an enemy for her association with the organization.\nSylux made their debut in 2004's Metroid Prime Hunters, attacking Samus as she explores the depths of the Vesper Defense Outpost. It's also believed that Sylux is piloting the ship that tracks Samus in the 'special ending' of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. There's a history here, so expect Sylux to be a formidable threat in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.\nWhy Metroid Prime 4 restarted development\nMetroid Prime 4 has been in some form of active development for nearly a decade \u2013 first teased in 2015, and later revealed at E3 2017.\nThe game was originally in development at Bandai Namco Studios, although it wasn't to be. Citing concerns over the quality of the production, Nintendo opted to restart development of Metroid Prime 4 in 2019 \u2013 handing the project over to Metroid Prime creator Retro Studios. It appears that everything is back on track now, with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond set to launch for Nintendo Switch - and Nintendo Switch 2 - in 2025.\nCheck out the best Switch 2 games to play while you wait for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.\nI started out writing for the games section of a student-run website as an undergrad, and continued to write about games in my free time during retail and temp jobs for a number of years.

Let's dive in.\nThis list of upcoming indie games was updated on August 1st, removing recent releases and adding some new indies we have an eye on.\n2025\nDiscounty\nRelease date: August 21, 2025\nPlatform(s): PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PS4, Switch\nDiscounty from developer Crinkle Cut Games is set to bring us to the harbor town of Blomkest, where you'll start managing your own discount supermarket that's been entrusted to you from your aunt. From organizing your stores layout, to looking after stock levels, and working at the checkout counter, you'll get to know the quirky locals and get sucked into town drama as you try to build up your discount empire. How you shape your store and how much it will come to benefit the town is for you to decide.\nIs This Seat Taken?\nRelease date: August 2025\nPlatform(s): PC, Switch\nIs This Seat Taken? is a new puzzle game from developer Poti Poti Studio that sees you try to seat a host of characters who all have their own very particular preferences. With a cute artstyle, it's described as being a \"low-pressure cozy\" puzzler that puts your logic to the test as you try to play matchmaker and place characters down in a variety of different settings and scenarios - from sitting on a bus to a wedding reception.\nBaby Steps\nRelease date: September 8, 2025\nPlatform(s): PC, PS5\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nBaby Steps from developers Gabe Cuzzillo, Max Boch, and Bennett Foddy is all about learning to walk again. Physics-based and comedic, you take on the role of Nate who, after watching One Piece in his family's basement for a very long time, has to rediscover what it means to put one foot in front of the other. From the minds behind Ape Out and Getting Over It, you can expect to fall over a lot as you try to master this wonderfully weird walking simulator.\nThe Berlin Apartment\nRelease date: November 2025\nPlatform(s): PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5\nThe Berlin Apartment from developer btf is a narrative first-person adventure that sees you take on the role of a handyman who sets out to refurbish an old apartment nestled in the city of Berlin, Germany. As work begins, you'll start to uncover the history of the apartment, with relics of the past turning into the silent witnesses of events that once took place inside the residence. With many stories to discover within the same four walls, it sounds as if we'll be peeling back layers of the past bit by bit as we go.\nTBC 2025\nGrave Seasons\nRelease date: TBC\nPlatform(s): PC\nIf you love farming with a dash of something spooky, Grave Seasons looks like the slasher Stardew Valley of your dreams... and nightmares. Not only will this adorable pixel RPG see you tending the fields as a doting farmer, you'll be dating the townsfolk and hoping beyond hope that they aren't a serial killer. I mean, it sounds like a pretty typical dating app experience in 2025 if you ask me, only much cuter given its charming isometric vibes.\nMixtape\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nPlatform(s): PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5\nMixtape is a new narrative adventure from Artful Escape developer, Beethoven and Dinosaur. Described as a musical retrospective, the story follows a group of friends as they head to a party on their last night together. As they make their way, you'll be taken back through musically-infused reenactments of their formative memories together.\nWinter Burrow\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nPlatform(s): PC, Xbox Series X/S\nWinter Burrow is a new survival game with a delightfully cute twist. With Wind in the Willows inspirations, Pine Creek Games' upcoming adventure sees you take on the role of a little mouse who returns home to try and restore their childhood burrow. While you'll have to face harsh, cold environments and dangerous insects as you gather resources, you'll always be able to return to the cozy safety of the burrow, where you can craft, bake pies, knit sweaters, and more.\nThe Mermaid's Mask\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nPlatform(s): PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5\nThe Mermaid's Mask is a follow-up to the excellent 2019 murder-mystery detective game, Tangle Tower from developer SFB Games. Bringing back main sleuths Detective Grimoire and Sally, you'll set out with the pair set to investigate the murder of Magnus Mortuga, who was the captain of the \"world's strangest submarine\". Strange things are evidently going on, with the mention of a possible curse. How intriguing. As you hunt for clues, you'll be able to once again interact with a variety of objects, which are all now in 3D.\nSlay the Spire 2\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nPlatform(s): PC\nAs a follow-up to the stellar roguelike deckbuilder released in 2019, Slay the Spire 2 from developer Mega Crit will see you return to the Spire in the sequel, with new slayers, enemies, events, treasures, and bosses to face. With various strategies to try out and decks to build, the sequel has been built on a new engine and is set to release in Early Access. The devs are even teasing new ways to play, but we'll have to wait and see just what those are.\nThe Gecko Gods\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nPlatform(s): PC, Switch\nIf you're looking for a relaxing puzzle-based experience, The Gecko Gods might just be one to add to your wishlist. Playing as a little gecko, you can explore a mysterious island and make the most of the lizard's agile movements to climb cliffs and yes, even eat bugs. Setting out on a quest to save their friend, The Gecko Gods sees you solve puzzles across crumbling ruins and discover the lore of the land as you explore. There's no way we can pass up the chance to play as a little gecko protagonist.\nBlippo+\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nPlaform(s): PC\nBlippo+ is a bit of mystery of a game, but an intriguing one at that. Coming from Untitled Goose Game and Thank Goodness You're Here publisher, Panic, it looks set to be a sort of FMV, text-based \"television experience\" that draws inspiration from '80s and '90s on a channel known as Blippo+. It certainly seems wonderfully weird, and we're here for it.\nTBC 2026\nToem 2\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nPlatform(s): PC\nToem 2 from developer Something We Made is the sequel to the wonderful 2021 photo adventure. Once again taking on the role of a photographer, the follow-up will see you set off on a new journey snapping pictures to uncover hidden secrets, solve puzzles, and help out friends along the way. The first game was truly a charming gem with a relaxing, laid back feel, and we have no doubt Toem 2 will be just as delightful.\nTBC\nNeverway\nRelease date: TBC\nPlatform(s): PC\nNeverway from developer Coldblood Inc is a new life sim that brings to mind games like Stardew Valley with its own distinct nightmarish twist.

      "text": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 \u2013 Everything we know so far about the upcoming shooter\nCall of Duty: Blacko Ops 7 is heading our way in 2025 and is returning to BO2's dark, tech-dominated future\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 is officially on the way, with its first reveal dropping during the Xbox showcase during the Summer Game Fest 2025 schedule. Set to bring us into the year 2035, some 40 years after the events of last year's Black Ops 6, we'll be seeing the return of David Mason in new entry from developers Tryarch and Raven Software.\nBlack Ops 6 turned out to be the biggest release in the franchise's history, so we're curious to see what Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 brings to the table when it arrives sometime later this year. With some details out there about what's in store, including co-op campaign and \"cutting-edge technology\" that we'll be able to wield in its futuristic setting, there are also some clues to dig into in its initial reveal trailer.\nSo, for a full overview of this exciting new game, read on below as we take you through everything we currently know so far about Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, from its story and setting, to its gameplay, and more.\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 release date speculation\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 is set to launch in late 2025. This big news came our way during Summer Game Fest, and all of us FPS fans couldn't be happier.\nXbox and Activision have yet to confirm a release date, and we're expecting to get the full answer at the reveal event coming later this summer. If we examine Call of Duty's traditional release windows, it's logical to expect Black Ops 7 to arrive between the late October period and mid-November. Stay tuned for updates.\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 platforms\nAt launch, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will be on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC via Xbox PC, Battle.net, and Steam. Of course, with Activision now being in the Xbox family, Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers will get it day one. But a potential release on the Switch 2 hasn't been mentioned. We'll be keeping an eye out for anything further updates in regard to Nintendo's latest console, but for the time being, it looks like it won't be landing on the platform.\nDespite the cutting-edge tech involved in the most recent Call of Duty games (BO6 used the IW 9.0 engine with current-gen-specific optimizations), the powers that be aren't ready to let go of last-gen consoles yet. Don't expect an optimal experience on 12-year-old hardware, though.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 trailer\nAt this stage, we've only received one look at Black Ops 7. It arrived right at the end of June 2025's Xbox Games Showcase and mostly consisted of a CG cutscene establishing the in-universe tech advancements in line with what we saw in 2012's Black Ops 2. It's an intriguing 3-minute teaser, though.\nAt the very end, we get quick glimpses of what appears to be in-game action, including multiplayer maps, campaign sections, and this year's Zombies mode. Of course, there's a new menace that needs to be taken down, and David Mason is back in action. Watch out for a surprise comeback, too.\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 story and setting\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 is set \"more than 40 years\" after Black Ops 6 in the year 2035, meaning it happens a whole decade after Black Ops 2, which took place in 2025 outside of its late-Cold War sections. If the 'numbers situation' of this sub-franchise doesn't make sense to you, know that you're not alone. It's the result of jumping all over the timeline in a very non-linear way and deciding to bring back numbered entries after Black Ops: Cold War.\nBefore we dive any deeper into Black Ops 7's story and setting, here's a rundown of the chronological order of the Black Ops sub-franchise: World at War (yes, it's connected to the series), 1, Cold War, 6, 2, 7, 4, and 3. Two important notes: If you want to avoid a bunch of spoilers, it's recommended to play 2 before 6 due to its late 1980s flashbacks, which have an impact on what comes after. Second, Black Ops 4 is skippable as it's the franchise's only multiplayer-only installment... and just isn't good overall.\nWith that whole mess out of the way, let's go back to Black Ops 7. Yes, it's set in the future, and the world is \"on the brink of chaos\" yet again. At this point, it's important to bring up that Black Ops 2 offered several endings depending on a couple of player choices and whether the optional Strike Force missions were completed or not before reaching the end of the campaign.\nWe've yet to receive confirmation on which ending has been chosen as 'canon' to shape the state of the world and the main characters when Black Ops 7's story begins, but the twisted bad guy Raul Menendez is back somehow. Many will instantly say he's not dead, but the Black Ops series is known for loopy twists and a focus on psychological warfare, so he could be back but not alive (think of The Joker's presence in Batman: Arkham Knight). Is he alive, dead but living rent-free in David Mason's head, or just part of an advanced AI system? All the options make sense in the Black Ops universe, so we're not ruling anything out.\nLittle else is known about the actual plot of the campaign beyond the fact that David Mason is said to lead a team and fight back against a \"manipulative enemy who weaponizes fear above all else.\"\nThe teaser trailer also provides some clues: peace has been restored (or is in the process of being restored) thanks to an organization called The Guild. During the events of Black Ops 6, this group is involved in weapon trafficking and smuggling. 40 years later, it's evolved into a seemingly huge global weapons manufacturer led by CEO Emma Kagan. They're offering to protect the world from itself thanks to all sorts of automated weapons, drones, and robots.\nNeedless to say, David Mason and his team will have a hard time believing The Guild, and Raul Menendez might be key to uncovering a new conspiracy.\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 gameplay\nThis is Call of Duty we're talking about, so we're not expecting any major shake-ups to the winning first-person shooter formula that's kept the franchise at the top of the food chain for so long. However, we must assume a number of additions introduced in 2024's Black Ops 6 \u2013 namely, the omni-movement system \u2013 are being kept around alongside refreshed mechanics from Black Ops 2 due to the return to its futuristic setting. All the specifics are expected to be revealed when the Black Ops 7 event happens this summer.\nWhat we do know already is the story campaign, developed by Raven Software, will be playable in co-op for the first time since Black Ops 3 (2015). \"Round-based Zombies in the heart of the Dark Aether\" are also back, meaning that Activision and Treyarch aren't messing with the core structure for the foreseeable future. Again, we'll be learning more soon.\nCan you pre-order Call of Duty: Black Ops 7?\nPre-orders for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 aren't available yet and likely won't go live until we have a firm release date.\nExpect this to change later this summer. Meanwhile, you can continue to grind through Black Ops 6's seasons, or go back and play through some of the best Call of Duty games.\nFor more future outings, read our pages on all the upcoming Xbox Series X games and upcoming PS5 games on the way.\nFran Ruiz is that big Star Wars and Jurassic Park guy.

      "text": "Xbox tries again, says Hollow Knight: Silksong will have a Gamescom 2025 demo, its first public showcase in 6 years, and suggests it's coming \"this holiday\"\nSilksong actually real, confirmed?\nHollow Knight: Silksong will have a public demo at Gamescom 2025 over in the Xbox corner, giving long-starved fans their first real taste of the game since an E3 2019 Nintendo Treehouse demo. Yeah, it's been that long. The upcoming Australian museum demo doesn't really count.\nXbox-related Silksong announcements have let fans down before, but this news comes after Team Cherry committed to a 2025 launch. Xbox seems to be putting Silksong down for a holiday release here.\n\"This year, the Xbox booth will be full of fantastic upcoming games from Xbox and our incredible third-party partners coming to Xbox, PC, and Game Pass this Holiday and beyond \u2013 and yes, that includes Hollow Knight: Silksong,\" the official Xbox blog reads, stopping just short of renting a marquee to write 'Silksong is real' in lights. This suggests a November or December Silksong release.\nThe Silksong demo will be playable on PC and the new ROG Xbox Ally X. The new Xbox-styled handheld PC previously featured Silksong in its reveal, and the game remains a day-one Xbox Game Pass title after all these years.\n\"And beyond\" leaves the door open for 2026 release dates (or later) for the games shown at Xbox Gamescom, which might seem scary, but try to focus on the \"holiday\" part here. Team Cherry \u2013 granted, not the most reliable oracle \u2013 has been sticking to a 2025 launch so far this year, so this holiday timing could actually narrow it down for us.\nNaturally, some of the Skong faithful have taken this as a sign that an unannounced Nintendo Direct rumored, as ever, for the coming months will give us a final release date. Apparently, they didn't learn their lesson from the other 47 Nintendo Direct no-shows. But hey, Silksong was at the Switch 2 reveal and that gave us the 2025 confirmation, so maybe Silksong has turned a corner.\nOther Skong devoted, worn down by years of desperation and rumor-mongering, seem to have rejected this news as a mere ploy, like tragic creatures trapped underground for years rejecting the sunlight they once fervently sought. I know it's hard to believe, so say it slowly: public demo, 2025 launch, probable holiday timing.

The game is said to be a faithful reimagining of the 2004 action title, and with no platform exclusivity, we can expect to see it on Xbox Series X in the not-too-distant future.

Discover secrets and hack your way through enemies and you seek to uncover the truth of the land. There\u2019s no map, compass, or quest tracker marker here so you\u2019ll have to dive fully into the unknown. It looks amazing from what we\u2019ve seen so far, so we don\u2019t mind the possibility of getting lost in Hell is Us.\nCronos: The New Dawn\nRelease date: September 5, 2025\nDeveloper: Bloober Team\nGame Pass: Yes\nBloober Team is back and, feeling fresh from its time with Silent Hill 2, it has another upcoming horror game in the works for us. Cronos: The New Dawn feels like the Dead Space 2 remake we haven't got yet, offering all the deep space terrors and grisly body horror a third-person shooter fan could ask for. Even better: Cronos looks set to come to Xbox Game Pass as a day-one entry, and with a Fall release date in the pipeline, get ready to celebrate Halloween in terrifying style.\nBorderlands 4\nRelease date: September 12, 2025\nDeveloper: Gearbox Software\nGame Pass: TBC\nAt Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024, we got the biggest reveal of the year: Borderlands 4 is coming out in 2025. Yep, that's right, we are getting some more looter shooter action. However, we won't be returning to Pandora this time around. Instead, players will explore new alien planets as they hunt for treasure and blast their way through waves of enemies. We can't wait, and this is easily one of our favorite upcoming Xbox Series X games to keep track of.\nDying Light: The Beast\nRelease date: September 19, 2025\nDeveloper: Techland\nGame Pass: TBC\nGet ready for some zombie action because Kyle Crane is making a comeback in the new game Dying Light: The Beast.

Now stranded in a village known as Tresna, you'll set out in search of treasure to sell in the shop you run by delving into dungeons.

We certainly loved the original experience - our Moonlighter review speaks to that.\nClockwork Revolution\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nDeveloper: inXile\nGame Pass: Yes\nA brand new upcoming RPG from the Wastelands team, Clockwork Revolution was announced at Xbox Games Showcase 2023. The trailer shows a steampunk-infused world that feels both historical and futuristic, complete with blimps overhead alongside floating steam trains weaving through the cityscape.

Set to launch in Early Access in 2025, Subnautica 2's biggest addition will be co-op, and it will be available on Game Pass from day one. Besides that, we know very little about Subnautica 2 - but that's just part of the fun (or fear), isn't it?\nWitchbrook\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nDeveloper: Chucklefish, Robotality\nGame Pass: TBC\nCozy gamers have been waiting for Witchbrook since 2018, and luckily, our patience has finally borne magical fruit since the life-sim will be launching on Xbox Series X sometime later this year.

While renovating the hotel with a talking decorator gun \u2013 yes, you read that right \u2013 you'll extend your decorative skills to the surrounding town, which seems to have a penchant for ska. There's just one catch: something fishy is going on, and if you're not careful while looking for your missing dad, \"they will Wicker Man your ass\". That's probably nothing \u2013 don't worry about it!\nAnimo\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nDeveloper: Pawprint Studio\nGame Pass: No\nThe pop tunes that score this introductory trailer are infectious, the star hero hoverboarding around a colorful world as they make friends with all manner of creatures. Somewhere between the likes of Pokemon and Palworld, Animo's big twist seems to come from the ability to actual control the critters you befriend by somehow transforming into them, exploring the world from their perspective as you battle some much bigger but no less cute beasties in real-time (one is called an Alpha Tubster).\nMudang: Two Hearts\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nDeveloper: EVR Studio\nGame Pass: No\nWhat makes you feel rage?

Also in the mix are strange humanoid machines. Emma also looks to have a loyal wolf companion who will help out.\nSuper Meat Boy 3D\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nDeveloper: Team Meat\nGame Pass: Yes\nEver wanted what Super Meat Boy would be like if it jumped from its two-dimensional roots into three dimensions? Don't expect a leap that's as game-changing as going from Super Mario Bros. to Super Mario 64, which is a good thing for fans of the brutally punishing precision platformer. The masochistic level design returns, only now in 3D, floating platforms harboring all sorts of saw blades and other traps that'll turn Meat Boy into viscera, allowing you to try again instantly. In essence, this is Super Meat Boy with added depth as you move in and out of hazards, rather than anything too different.\nPlague Tale Legacy Resonance\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nDeveloper: Asobo Studio\nGame Pass: Yes\nSo long to Amicia and Hugo - the new Plague Tale game features what looks like a new protagonist.

The upcoming side-scrolling platformer shows two once-close sisters embroiled in a bitter feud, set against the backdrop of a beautiful fantasy world that's \"fractured\" by the sisters' quarrel. Pitched by the developer as a \"more intense, more action-driven game, but no less intimate\" than the likes of Spiritfarer, we'll get to see what all the beautiful hand-crafted action is all about when At Fate's End launches sometime in 2026.\nOut of Words\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nDeveloper: WiredFly, Kong Orange\nGame Pass: TBC\nOut of Words is a new co-op platforming adventure in a world that's entirely crafted by hand, which is reflected in its unique puppet-like artstyle.

Set more than 40 years after Black Ops 6 in 2035, we don't yet know much about the plot of the next installment, but with sleek new weapons, invisibility, and jumps out of cool new dropships, the trippy imagery in its initial reveal trailer suggests a deeper dive into the weird, dream-like pseudo-horror sequences we loved in BLOPS 6.

If that name sounds familiar, it's because Routine was actually announced a decade ago. The studio announced it, showed a little of its haunting sci-fi world to the public, and then disappeared from the face of the planet. We're happy Routine is back though, because between the low-fi tech you'll need to wield to survive, some genuinely awe-inspiring environments, and hellishly creepy androids, this looks like an unmissable horror game. Routine doesn't have a release window, but it is set to launch on Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Game Pass.\nState of Decay 3\nRelease date: TBC\nDeveloper: Undead Labs\nGame Pass: Yes\nState of Decay is back with the third entry in the zombie survival-horror series. Cleverly called State of Decay 3. Currently in early development, it's looking to bring fans the 'ultimate' zombie survival sim, and from the looks of the first trailer, it's going to brutal. Zombie deers, folks. Zombie deers. Graphically the game looks fantastic, so expect things to be even more gruesome than ever before.\nShe Dreams Elsewhere\nRelease date: TBC\nDeveloper: Studio Zevere\nGame Pass: Yes\nTrapped in a coma, Thalia's only hope of escape is to confront her own nightmares that are keeping her there. She Dreams Elsewhere has a surreal art style that nods towards Undertale and Earthbound (and has similar turn-based combat to match), the strange world within Thalia's mind is filled with interesting and intriguing places to explore. Characters can be customized in combat using Charms, and further enhanced by building Connections with them (which we hope is a little like Persona in action).\nTides of Annihilation\nRelease date: TBC\nDeveloper: Eclipse Glow Games\nGames Pass: TBC\nTides of Annihilation is an upcoming Xbox games that's a stunning looking hack-and-slash fantasy adventure, set in the backdrop of London in ruins. Here you'll play as the young Gwendolyn who is the city's last survivor. However, there are a ton of fantastical looking foes and bosses, eager to finish off humanity once and for all. Tides of Annihilation was announced during the February 2025 PlayStation State of Play showcase, and from the clips of the game that we've seen so far, it looks like the action is at the forefront and that the unique setting works beautifully. For sure, it's one to keep an eye on.\nFor more new picks, check out our lists of all the upcoming PS5 games and new PC games heading our way.
