  "title": "Paul Smith\u2019s Foundation, CFDA Program Supports American Fashion Design",
  "description": "Founded in 2020, the philanthropic arm of the British brand helped established Fashion Residency at Studio Smithfield in London to support young fashion talent",
  "content": "In the Edith Wharton novel \u201cThe Buccaneers\u201d and the current Apple TV+ series, the premise is Gilded Age American heiresses aiding titled Brits with their pocketsful of money in exchange for social status. Today in fashion, the tables have turned, thanks to Sir Paul Smith\u2014he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000\u2014a Brit is offering an opportunity of financial support for an American fashion designer. In continuing to expand the reach of the Paul Smith Foundation, the British tailored clothing legend\u2019s philanthropic venture will expand support via its fashion program to Americans in partnership with the CFDA, as both entities share the mission to promote and support the education of fashion designers to grow their creativity and innovation.\n\nStarting on August 14th, the CFDA will invite designers to apply to the program, which will give one lucky applicant the chance to join Fashion Residency at Studio Smithfield in London for its second-year cohort alongside six UK-based designers. Established in 2024, The Fashion Residency at Studio Smithfield, founded by The Mayor of London, Projekt, and Paul Smith\u2019s Foundation, was enabled with support from the City of London Corporation. Established in 2020 to coincide with Paul\u2019s 50th year of business, Paul Smith\u2019s Foundation was created to support early-career creative people working in fashion, visual arts, and design.\n\nThe recipient of the inaugural Paul Smith\u2019s Foundation x CFDA Designer-in-Residence will receive a complimentary 400-sqft studio space for 12 months, supported by Projekt, mentoring from industry leaders, and business-planning training, visa, flights, as well as a significant contribution to their living.\n\nWhile up-and-coming British designers have especially struggled post-Brexit, current economic and political factors in the US are pointing to funding for the arts and access to education diminishing daily. Together, the CFDA and Sir Paul aim to help nurture young talent towards their own sustainable businesses.\n\n\u201cPartnering with the CFDA to have this opportunity to have an American-based designer join the Fashion Residency is delightful, and hopefully, it will be a life-changing experience for them. We formalized the Paul Smith\u2019s Foundation a few years ago, but I have been told quite flatteringly that we\u2019ve been running one for years without realizing it! I have had designers come to me for years, like John Galliano and Alexander McQueen just to name two who have come for advice, basic advice like \u2018what\u2019s a collaboration, what\u2019s a contract\u2019\u2026not advice on how to design, or run a studio or how to put a collection together but very practical advice and that\u2019s what I am very proud of what our foundation does,\u201d said Sir Paul Smith in a release.\n\n\u201cFashion is a truly global business, and an opportunity such as this will provide one American talent with invaluable experience and exposure in an international market,\u201d said Steven Kolb, CFDA CEO and President. \u201cThe chance to work alongside peers in the UK fosters creative exchange, builds cross-cultural understanding, and strengthens our industry. We are deeply grateful to Sir Paul Smith for his continued collaboration and dedication to nurturing the next generation of talent.\n\nIn September 2025, shortlisted candidates will be interviewed by a panel including Sir Paul Smith, Steven Kolb, Chief Executive Officer and President at CFDA, and Sara Kozlowski, Vice President of Program Strategies / Education & Sustainability Initiatives at CFDA, in New York City, where the recipient will be determined.\n\nCloser to another example of the CFDA teaming up with designers to support the next generation of talent, the Veronica Beard X CFDA Creative Futures Scholarship just announced its 2025 class, which includes incoming FIT senior Athmiha Saravanen for tailoring; another incoming FIT senior Giorgio Parolini Arroyo for soft wovens; Polimoda Florence transfer student now at FIT Samira Koehler for knitwear, and Marist University incoming senior Lena Alibrio for denim.",

      "text": "Veronica Beard is ready to take its woman-on-the-go style global.\nThe brand, known for its versatile styling and layering of blazers and dickeys, plus jeans, shoes and accessories, has built a reputation as a contemporary fashion label that can dress the modern working woman. After spending the past year putting puzzle pieces into place, the brand is now well-positioned for stronger international expansion, as a significant shift is underway in the prestige and luxury fashion markets.\nThe brand, which launched in 2010 from sisters-in-law Veronica Swanson Beard and Veronica Miele Beard, now has 41 stores in places like New York City; Troy, Mich., and Seattle. In the past 12-months alone, Veronica Beard has opened at least eight stores. The overall business is approximately two-thirds direct-to-consumer and one-third wholesale retail, with annual revenue of more than $300 million, said Stephanie Unwin, president of Veronica Beard.\nOver the same 12-months, the Veronica Beard assortment has also grown with the addition of handbags. Priced at under $700, the idea was to offer a more affordable item to bring younger and more aspirational consumers into the brand. It\u2019s a strategy that has proven effective in the past. Veronica Beard launched shoes in 2017 for under $500, and it has grown by triple digits in the past year. Typically, Veronica Beard\u2019s hallmark blazers retail for approximately $700 to $800.\n\u201cWhen you look at the model, even with luxury, the accessories are often the entry point [for customers],\u201d said Unwin. \u201cWe thought about that similarly; and, when we looked at the market opportunity ... we wanted to fill the white space between mass, contemporary and the luxury brands.\u201d\nThe big focus now is on international markets like Munich, Amsterdam, Brussels, and Geneva through wholesale partnerships. Currently, the brand has a presence in London, Germany, and the Benelux region of Brussels, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Veronica Beard will also open up to five stores over the next three years. The past year required focus on building a team to oversee international expansion, distribution and technological infrastructure. In March, Veronica Beard hired Francois LeFloch, as head of Veronica Beard International. More recently, in May, the brand announced the hire of Halsey Anderson as chief brand officer, a newly created post. Under that role, Anderson will be tasked with crafting the global brand vision, including influencer and social media marketing, creative assets, styling and editorial.\n\u201cEurope is a key growth market for us\u2014our wholesale business has already shown strong potential, and now we want to complement that with retail spaces that fully express our brand\u2019s identity,\u201d said LeFloch. \u201cCities like Paris and Milan [are]\nThe backdrop to Veronica Beard\u2019s growth is the ongoing decline in luxury sales, driving customers to look to other brands and more accessible, yet still high-quality, offerings. Since 2024, luxury brands from conglomerates like Kering, LVMH and Richemont have experienced inconsistent quarters of sales growth and decline. In April, Kering shared its first-quarter sales declined by 14% year-over-year with a whopping 25% year-over-year sales drop at its flagship Gucci brand. Also in April, LVMH shared that first-quarter fashion sales declined 5% year-over-year. Meanwhile, Richemont exceeded analyst expectations in May for its fourth-quarter sales, after a tough first-half of fiscal 2025 sales. Fourth-quarter sales rose 7% year-over-year, thanks in part to its jewelry brand, Cartier.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an undeniably challenging time for many brands given the global climate. While luxury is currently under pressure, our positioning offers a unique advantage,\u201d said LeFloch. \u201cSuccess will come from choosing the right locations that align with our brand and values.\u201d\nThe brand positioning has not only focused expansion categories like handbags, but also on strategic partnerships and a focus on sportswear. Following a collaboration with the NFL in Oct. 2024, the team then set its eyes on the French Open in early June with an eight-piece capsule collection with Head Sportswear. NCAA tennis champion Ayan Broomfield, starred in the collab campaign. Sportswear, a quintessentially American category, is also the focus for the brand\u2019s resort 2026 collection, dubbed \u201cVarsity Electric,\u201d which features a sportswear-heavy offering mingled with Veronica Beard\u2019s traditional styles.\n\u201cOur woman has always been on the go. We've always tried to serve up an offering that provides her with that versatility,\u201d said Unwin. \u201cHopefully, we make her feel confident when she's out there, making it happen, and that's the most important thing.\u201d"

The ten finalists include Angelo Fabricio Urrutia of 4SDESIGNS; Colin LoCascio of Colin Locascio, Rachel Scott of Diotima, Kim Shui of Kim Shui, Kozaburo Akasaka of Kozaburo, Melitta Baumeister of Melitta Baumeister, Sami Miro of Sami Miro Vintage, Fletcher Kasell and Tanner Richie of Tanner Fletcher, Everard Best and T\u00e9la D'Amore of Who Decides War and Henry Zankov of Zankov. This year marks the program returning to its original format, which names one grand prize winner and two runners-up. The winner will be $300,000 and the other two runners-up $100,000 each. The program helps create meaningful business mentorships and a pathway to success for all finalists.\n\"Every year, I am astounded by how much talent we have in this country, with designers who are as wildly creative as they are sensitive to the world today. They're not only imaginative but also strive to be thought leaders and community creators, reminding us that fashion can be meaningful to everyone. I'm delighted to say that this year's ten CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalists are all those things\u2014and more. My congratulations to our class of 2023,\u201d Anna Wintour, Chief Content Officer, Cond\u00e9 Nast and Global Editorial Director, Vogue, said in a release.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important that the world sees this new generation of American designers\u2026 the talent in the united states is unparalleled in regards to creativity and diversity and, moreover, truly American\u2026 the CFDA/Vogue fashion fund shines an important and generous light on this,\u201d Thom Browne, Chairman of the CFDA, said in a release.\nLike many businesses in New York, young fashion brands faced shutting down for good following the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in 2001. Vogue established the program partly due to former Vogue market editor Meredith Melling who rallied support for the designers after learning of their struggles after 9/11, which resulted in human loss and business losses. In 2004 the first CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund was awarded to Jack McCollough, and Lazaro Hernandez of Proenza Schouler. Other previous prize winners and runners-up include Christopher John Rogers, Kerby Jean-Raymond, Jonathan Cohen, and Emily Bode.\nDuring the pandemic, an interim program mission was established A Common Thread repurposed for a two-year iteration A Common Thread. This will remain incorporated\u2014to raise both awareness and needed funds for those in the American fashion community who have been impacted by COVID-19.\nThe selection committee gathers boldface names of the fashion industry including designers, retailers, journalists, talents, and business owners. This includes Steven Kolb of the CFDA, Vogue staffers Mark Holgate and Chioma Nnadi, Aurora James of Brother Vellies and the Fifteen Percent Pledge, Rool Patel of Saks Fifth Avenue, Eva Chen of Instagram, Sam Lobban of Nordstrom"

      "text": "Stepping off the busy streets of Paris into the Paul Smith showroom to discover the autumn-winter 2022 women\u2019s ready-to-wear collection is like stepping into the yesteryear of the 1960s. For this new season Smith dived right into an era of French cinema of New Wave films to tell a sartorial story filled with the house\u2019s true to form tailoring and lively fall colors.\nHow it all came to be\nBut before diving into the collection, it\u2019s worth getting to know the man Sir Paul Smith himself. Born in Nottingham, England, Smith left school at fifteen to pursue being a racing cyclist. But, it was a bad bicycle accident that led young Smith to turn from cycling to designing clothes. Fashion was not his first love. It\u2019s something the designer developed a love for a few years later. Another unique thing about him is that he\u2019s not trained in fashion design. His wife taught him and with a lot of practice he has created an established brand. His wife Pauline, his then girlfriend, encouraged Smith to pursue the art of designing clothes and to open a shop, and what a strong sense she had.\nWhen sitting and talking to Smith, he exudes the saying, \u201cnever despise small beginnings,\u201d and small beginnings did he have. For him he is glad the company did not grow, as he called it, \u201clike a rocket.\u201d\n\u201cShe [Pauline] and I made the clothes for the shop and then we bought some clothes from young designers to complement our clothes. That was in 1970 and six years later we started to make a small collection of clothes to sell to other shops, and she designed those. I didn\u2019t design them, and from 76\u2019-81\u2019 Pauline designed the clothes and I was in charge of everything else. She then went on to study art and the history of art, and decided to leave fashion and at that point I was experienced and qualified enough to take over the reigns as the designer.\nToday the brand has 62 stores, owning showrooms in Milan, London, New York, Paris and Tokyo - and owning its warehouse in Nottingham, and employs close to two-thousand employees. \u201cI\u2019m one of the few designers who owns their own brand, and there are some amazing and talented designers but they work for big corporations.\u201d While the brand may not be as big as a corporate brand, Smith is modest about the success of it. The brand\u2019s fifty-two-year growth is rooted in his love for Pauline, who though retired, still offers sartorial counsel. And, it\u2019s also due to his humility and sincere kindness to everyone he meets.\nIn those early years Paul gained hand\u2019s on know-how by training under a Saville Row tailor, Lincroft and Kilgour and attending Haute Couture shows in Paris. \u201cI was 21 I was privileged to go to the Haute Couture shows when couture was only eight or twenty people in the audience of brands that only had two shows a day for two weeks, no music and only sixteen or twenty outfits. What was remarkable is that there would be a famous singer, socialite, or someone from the Kennedy family. But there was also two nuns, and 3-5 young girls aged fifteen or sixteen at nearly every show I went to- Chanel, Saint Laurent, Courr\u00e8ges, and Balmain. The reason they were there is the fact the nuns knew they could get a beautiful career as a seamstress or an embroider in fashion.\u201d\nThe 60s influence on Smith\nWhat\u2019s unique about Smith is that he has an affinity for the \u201960s and \u201970s and it shows in his collections. He\u2019s not one to shy away from wide pantlegs at the hems, or throw in pops of colors.\n\u201cI was a teenager in the \u201960s and I think whenever there is period of time as a human being that\u2019s impactful, it\u2019s being a youth. This is when you often experience things for the first time like falling in love, traveling abroad, or seeing a band,\u201d he muses. The 60s was only important to me because I was young and experienced things for the first time. This was the period of the second and third generations after the horror of war, and it was the first-time people could actually relax by growing their hair long or playing the guitar, to just do something that had never really been done before. It was period or release.\u201d\nThe collection\nAnd the 60s are very much a part of this collection. Keeping with the times, the world is, in mind, Smith wanted a collection of pieces that are relaxed. For a long period during the pandemic, people wore sweats and pajamas. His background in tailoring allowed him to move the boundary of relaxed-wear but still maintain the tailoring, creating a collection of comfort.\n\u201cThe collection is very relaxed and very modern. It means that any woman could wear this collection and feel very much of now in a beautifully created way. The cloths are really beautiful, there\u2019s a lot of sustainability aspects or organic aspects to the collection, recycled fabrics and organic fabrics. The tailoring is constructed in a way that\u2019s very comfortable. So, anyone that has been used to wearing sweatpants and hoodies can now dress up in a way that\u2019s still comfortable.\u201d\nIn addition to the tailoring, the cuts are also noticeable. In the men\u2019s looks Smith has created plants with inverted pleating, giving them a unique flow as one walks. It was Pauline that taught her husband about balance and proportion with the correct sized pockets, suppression into the waist so that the designer can respect the female form. For Smith, it\u2019s a collection that he calls, \u201csimple but beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe men\u2019s collection is inspired by the art films from France in the 60s. It\u2019s very much about the color you were used to seeing in 60s films. It was very experimental at that time, and filters were put onto the lenses and the colors were slightly distorted,\u201d he shares. And this is quite palpable in the collection, of the designs being reminiscent of what you would see at that time in film.\n\u201cI love my job and I love life,\u201d he says. Retirement doesn\u2019t seem to be on the horizon for the seventy-five-year-old. \u201cLife is changing very fast with modern communication and a lot of things. The joy of Paul Smith is continuity. \u201cOn my tombstone it will be \u2018not bad, he did ok,\u2019\u201d he laughs. While the brand hasn\u2019t grown like a rocket, its pace has been in line with natural growth as Smith has been able to keep the company relevant."

      "text": "This article contains spoilers from Season 3 of The Gilded Age.\nAnother dramatic season of The Gilded Age is coming to a close, and the highly anticipated Season 3 finale is now streaming on HBO Max. Here\u2019s everything to know about the status of The Gilded Age Season 4, including the renewal status, plot, returning cast and more.\nAhead of Season 3, Louisa Jacobson told viewers to expect \u201ca lot of plot twists.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to keep you on your toes,\u201d the actress told People, and she wasn\u2019t lying. One of the biggest twists in Season 3 came in Episode 6 with the surprise death of John Adams, who was struck by a speeding horse carriage moments after sharing one last romantic moment with Oscar.\nBy the end of the penultimate episode, George Russell was also in danger of being killed off after an unknown assailant shot him in his office. George ultimately survived the gunshot wound (thanks to Dr. Kirkland), but one downside of his near-death experience is that it may have made him more certain tha his marriage with Bertha may be broken after all. (He still can\u2019t forgive his wife for marrying their daughter Gladys off to the Duke of Buckingham to one-up the Astors.)\nWhen Carrie Coon, who portrays Bertha, was asked by Variety whether George and Bertha will be able to put aside their differences next season, she answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know. It depends what George wants.\u201d\nOscar, who is still grieving the loss of John, is considering the idea of a mutually beneficial marriage to Enid. And, in a twist of events, Gladys and the Duke are happy together and expecting a child.\nThe finale also saw Marian and Larry reconcile and continue their engagement after she broke off their relationship by letter, a decision she made after he lied to her and her aunts about his whereabouts. Another beautiful moment from Episode 8 was when William surprised Peggy and proposed to her at the Black Ball.\n\u201cWe shot that over three 20-hour days, and when [director Salli Richardson-Whitfield] showed me the playback on set, when Peggy turns around in slow motion, I just burst into tears,\u201d Den\u00e9e Benton told TV Line about filming the touching scene.\nReady for more of The Gilded Age following the finale? Keep reading to learn the latest on season four.\nWill There Be The Gilded Age Season 4?\nYes, HBO announced on July 28, 2025, that the series had been renewed for a fourth season, a few episodes before the Season 3 finale.\nThe renewal comes as HBO reports that total premiere-night viewing for Season 3 has increased for five consecutive weeks, resulting in a 20 percent growth over last season. Fan engagement has also risen, with social chatter jumping nearly 60 percent week over week.\nAdditionally, the third season has received the most critical acclaim than the previous two seasons. Variety\u2019s TV critic Alison Herman called it \u201cthe best season yet,\u201d adding that it \u201crecalibrates The Gilded Age into a show that\u2019s more dramatic in some areas and more lighthearted in others than it\u2019s been in the past.\u201d\nWhat Will The Gilded Age Season 4 Be About?\nThe plot details for The Gilded Age Season 4 are under wraps. Fellowes said in a recent interview with TV Insider that he doesn\u2019t have a plan for further seasons of the show, but said that the job is to \u201creinvent\u201d the series every season.\n\u201cBut each time you have to reinvent the show in order to give it a new dynamic to fit its new proportions. And I think that is part of our job,\" he explained. \"That\u2019s part of what you do if you write a series for television. So in a sense, each [season] has to have a satisfactory conclusion given what\u2019s taken place within the series, but an open end where we may be going to, and that is the sort of double discipline that we write to really.\"\nOne question many fans will likely have following the events of the Season 3 finale is whether Bertha and George\u2019s relationship is heading for divorce, despite the strong foundation of their marriage. \u201cI\u2019m ruthless in business, not with the people I love,\u201d he said to his wife before leaving for an unknown amount of time. When she asked if he was coming back, he replied, \u201cNot until we know what we want.\u201d She says that she wants them to be together, but he says he\u2019s \u201cnot so sure.\u201d\nCould there be a chance that George and Bertha will spend some time apart in Season 4? Morgan Spector, who plays George, thinks so. \u201cBecause we know how good this couple can be together, it would be really fascinating to see them spend a season figuring out how to get back to each other,\u201d he told TVLine.\nMeanwhile, Coon believes her character will fix things, telling The Hollywood Reporter that Bertha\u2019s \u201cwheels are already turning about how she\u2019s going to fix it.\u201d She continued, \u201cYou know she\u2019s not going to give up on it. She\u2019s indefatigable, of course. So I think she\u2019s looking out that window and she\u2019ll have a moment of grief, and then she\u2019s going to get to work on some kind of plan.\u201d\nWho Will Be The Gilded Age Season 4 Cast?\nReturning and new cast members for The Gilded Age Season 4 have not been revealed, but there\u2019s strong chance that the main cast will return. This includes Bertha Russell (Coon), George Russell (Spector), Ada Brook (Cynthia Nixon), Agnes van Rhijn (Christine Baranski), Marian Brook (Louisa Jacobson), Gladys Russell (Taissa Farmiga), Peggy Scott (Den\u00e9e Benton), and more.\nClaybourne Elder, who portrays John Adams, is unlikely to return following his character\u2019s tragic death in Season 3.\nWhen Will The Gilded Age Season 4 Come Out?\nHBO has yet to announce a premiere date for The Gilded Age Season 4. The first season debuted in 2022, followed by Season 2 in 2023. There was then a two-year period before Season 3 was released in June 2025, so the fourth season could come out anywhere from next year to mid-2027.\nThe Gilded Age Season 3 is airing on HBO Max."
