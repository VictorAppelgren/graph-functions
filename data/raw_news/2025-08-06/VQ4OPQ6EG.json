  "content": "Nashville, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Republican US Sen. Marsha Blackburn announced on Wednesday that she is entering the open Tennessee governor\u2019s race in 2026, setting up a primary clash with US Rep. John Rose.\n\nBlackburn\u2019s announcement makes official what had been expected for some time from the ally of President Donald Trump. She had made no secret that she was planning on running for the position.\n\nIt sets up a Republican primary clash in August 2026 against Rose who is also a Trump backer. They will be competing to replace GOP Gov. Bill Lee, who is hitting his limit of two four-year terms in office.\n\nBlackburn won her Senate seat in 2018 by nearly 11 percentage points over Democrat Phil Bredesen, a popular former governor. That victory marked a rightward shift from previous Republican senators who has represented the state. She then won reelection against Democratic state Rep. Gloria Johnson by more than 29 percentage points last November.\n\nFirst elected to the US House in 2002, Blackburn aligned with the tea party movement and regularly appeared on Fox News. Before that, the Brentwood resident made a name for herself as a state lawmaker who helped lead the revolt against a proposed Tennessee income tax in the early 2000s.\n\nIn an opening campaign ad, Blackburn lauded Trump, promised leadership in job creation and energy production and hit on timely conservative themes \u2014 for example, empowering parents in education, defining \u201cboys and girls the way God made them,\u201d and deporting immigrants in the country illegally, \u201cwhether it takes planes, trains or starships.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn his first six months, President Trump has made historic strides in Making America Great Again, but as he sends power back to the states, he\u2019s going to need strong conservative governors who can bring that revolution home,\u201d Blackburn said in an announcement news release. \u201cI\u2019m running to serve as Tennessee\u2019s next governor to ensure Tennessee is America\u2019s conservative leader.\u201d\n\nRose, who announced his bid for governor in March, likewise has voiced strong support for Trump in a state that Trump has easily won in the past three presidential elections. Trump won Tennessee in 2024 by nearly 30 points and Lee defeated a Democratic opponent in 2022 by 32 percentage points.\n\nBlackburn\u2019s prior statements about considering a bid for governor scared off some prominent Republicans who may have otherwise run.\n\nRose, a Cookeville businessman and farmer who can tap into personal wealth, lent his campaign $5 million and raised $1.1 million from donors through June.\n\nCito Pellegra of Arlington joins Blackburn and Rose in the GOP primary.\n\nSeveral Democrats have announced or opened fundraising accounts for the race so far. They include Memphis city councilmember Jerri Green, Memphis community advocate Carnita Atwater, musician Adam \u201cDitch\u201d Kurtz and Tim Cyr from Gallatin.",

      "text": "Rep. Marsha Blackburn will win the race to represent Tennessee in the US Senate, CNN can project, outlasting a challenge from former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat who looked to run against his party to win in a state President Donald Trump won by 26 percentage points in 2016.\nBlackburn, a conservative lawmaker closely tied to the President, looked to nationalize the Senate race as much as possible, hoping to tap into the same conservatism that elected Trump in order to blunt some goodwill Bredesen had built up during his two terms as governor. Trump visited the state three times. Blackburn will be the first female senator to represent her state.\nDemocrats had hoped to pick up Tennessee as part of a narrow path to retaking the Senate.\nAlthough Bredesen ran as a Democrat, he largely ran away from the national party and regularly touted his ties to the state and independence from Washington, D.C. The strategy was clear: He hoped to bank on the fact he won every county in the state in 2006 during his second run for governor and looked to tag Blackburn as a traditional Washington ideologue.\nBredesen got some help, too. Sen. Bob Corker, whose decision to retire opened the seat and gave way to the Democratic campaign, declined to help bury the popular Democrat, a clear sign that not all Republicans have been wooed by the Trump wing of the party.\nAnd the former governor also energized Tennessee Democrats who had long struggled to gain traction in the state. Taylor Swift, a pop star known for staying out of politics, eagerly got behind his campaign, too.\nBlackburn, however, looked to highlight Bredesen\u2019s party affiliation at every turn, regularly tying him to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and some of the more high-profile liberal members of the legislative body.\n\u201cPhil Bredesen has said he would have voted against the tax cuts,\u201d Blackburn said during one debate. \u201cChuck Schumer has bought and paid for his campaign.\u201d\nBredesen looked to blunt the attack by telling voters he would not back Schumer for Majority Leader if he were elected.\nThe former governor also announced during the campaign that he would have voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial Supreme Court pick, whose confirmation hearings became a national event after professor Christine Blasey Ford testified that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in high school. Kavanaugh denied the allegations."
