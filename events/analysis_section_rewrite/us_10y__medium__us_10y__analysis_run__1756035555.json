      "feedback": "The analysis is solid on the near-term fundamentals for ACMR but falls short of a world-class, sector-level plan for a 3–6 month horizon; it should be rewritten as a formal catalyst map with timing, path-dependency, and explicit invalidations, anchored tightly to the data in the sources. Actions: (1) Convert to a 3–6 month scenario framework (base/bull/bear) with quantified triggers and windows: base-case catalysts are the Q2’25 deliverables (rev $215m, gross margin ~49%, net margin ~13–14%, debt/equity ~23%), plus the 2025 revenue guide ($850–$950m) and the implied long-run path to $1.4b by 2028, with a near-term price path toward the mid-to-high $30s if the ramp and international expansion proceed; bull-case adds upside if the 2028 trajectory increasingly materializes and the N2 bubbling Ultra C tool accelerates share gains, while bear-case hinges on escalated U.S.–China export controls or a slower-than-expected ramp. (SK994CBWR) (2) Specify precise timing windows and path-dependency: identify near-term inflection points (e.g., next two quarterly prints and any updates to the 2025 guide) and link to macro policy timing (Powell rate-cut signals) and WFE demand cycles; this ties horizon to observable events rather than abstract potential. (3) Add explicit invalidation metrics: e.g., if 2025 guidance is cut or if N2 bubbling adoption stalls beyond a 1–2 quarter window, or if export-control risk crystallizes, then drop the bullish baseline; (SK994CBWR) (4) Quantify and bind macro signals to ACMR: state how rate-cut timing and AI/digitalization demand trend could alter capex sentiment for semiconductor equipment, ensuring the macro backdrop is not treated as a generic backdrop but as a trigger with a known cadence; (5) Reconcile and justify cross-source tensions: treat the Grand Forks UAS piece as a macro capex proxy with caveats about data quality and attribution, and keep it as a peripheral backdrop rather than a core earnings driver; cite it only as a soft sectoral signal (FOM34PUWA); (6) Tighten the investment thesis on product ramps: quantify the incremental margin impact of Ultra C wb/N2 bubbling upgrades and the contribution to 2025 guidance recovery, avoiding vague “high-margin tooling” language and anchoring to the mid-40s gross margin and ~13–14% net margin observed (SK994CBWR). (7) Edit for disciplined valuation storytelling: keep the current consensus target ($34.76) as a ceiling/discovery potential, but frame the base-case price trajectory within 3–6 months as a probabilistic move modestly above $30, with clear upside only if the catalysts execute; (SK994CBWR) (8) Source discipline: ensure all numeric references come from SK994CBWR for ACMR and clearly tag macro mentions to FOM34PUWA and MTB context to avoid overstating the direct link; (9) Improve structure and clarity by removing extraneous dividend-health narrative from MTB when discussing ACMR, and keep cross-asset context at a high level to avoid dilution of the ACMR thesis. Overall, implement a scorable, event-driven path with explicit triggers, invalidations, timing windows, and watch-list signals, then close with base-case, 1–2 alts, explicit risks, and a defined confidence rating (SK994CBWR) (FOM34PUWA) (3JR35PMNT).",
