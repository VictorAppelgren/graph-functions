  "content": "is a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nThe launch of ESPN\u2019s long-awaited standalone streaming service is just weeks away. Alongside its earnings results on Wednesday, Disney revealed that ESPN\u2019s streaming service and its \u201cenhanced\u201d app will arrive on August 21st for $29.99 per month.\n\nESPN\u2019s new streaming service, which remains separate from ESPN Plus, will offer access to the network\u2019s linear channels, including ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, SECN, ACN, and more. The service will include 47,000 live sporting events every year, in addition to on-demand replays and original programming.\n\nJust ahead of Disney\u2019s earnings, the NFL announced that it\u2019s acquiring a 10 percent stake in ESPN. In exchange, ESPN is taking control of the NFL Network and gaining the license to select NFL content, including some out-of-market pre-season games during the 2025 and 2026 season, that it will air on its standalone service.\n\nAs part of the deal, ESPN\u2019s streaming service, along with Disney Plus and Hulu, will stream the NFL draft starting with the 2026 season. ESPN users will also be able to add the NFL Plus Premium plan to their subscription, which includes access to NFL RedZone. Additionally, a new deal with the WWE will make ESPN and its streaming service the home to \u201cexclusive\u201d wrestling events in the US next year, including WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and others. (NBCUniversal\u2019s Peacock previously streamed these events.)\n\nThe competition between live sports streaming services is heating up. In addition to ESPN, Comcast and DirecTV launched sports-focused streaming offerings earlier this year in an attempt to patch up the fractured landscape. Fox\u2019s sports and news streaming service also arrives on August 21st for a cheaper $19.99 per month.\n\nThe flagship $29.99 per month ESPN \u201cunlimited\u201d plan will exist alongside ESPN Plus, which will still cost $11.99 per month and house a more limited selection of live sports. ESPN will also be available with a number of plan options that include bundles with Disney Plus and Hulu. People who already have a pay TV subscription that includes ESPN will be able to access the streaming service for free.\n\nFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.",

The service, called Fox One, will cost $19.99 per month or $199.99 per year when it launches on August 21st \u2014 just weeks before the start of the 2025 NFL season on September 4th.\nFox first announced its streaming service in May. It will combine livestreams and on-demand content from Fox News, Fox Sports, FS1, FS2, Fox Business Network, Fox Weather, local Fox stations, and other channels. Users will also get the option to bundle Fox One with its Fox Nation subscription for $24.99 per month. Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch said during an earnings call on Tuesday that Fox One will be available to pay TV subscribers for free, according to CNBC.\nWith a base price of $19.99 per month, Fox One is cheaper than ESPN\u2019s standalone streaming app, which will cost $29.99 each month when it arrives in the fall. We will likely hear more about ESPN\u2019s rival app, including when it might arrive, during Disney\u2019s earnings call this week.\nIn addition to ESPN, Fox One will also have to compete with the sports-focused streaming services from DirecTV and Comcast, which emerged after Fox\u2019s plans to create a live sports streaming package with ESPN and Warner Bros.

Though you don\u2019t need Xfinity\u2019s X1 TV box to access the bundle, Comcast says using one will give you access to features like multiview, \u201cenhanced\u201d 4K, and Odds Zone, which displays odds from DraftKings and FanDuel. You can also find the Sports & News TV package from the Xfinity Stream app on mobile and smart TV platforms like Apple TV and Roku.\nAdditionally, Comcast notes that you can combine the sports streaming subscription with some of the company\u2019s other packages, like the $9.95 per month More Sports & Entertainment package, which comes with channels like NFL RedZone, MLB Network, NBA TV, and NHL Network. Both Xfinity and non-Xfinity customers can access the package at the $70 price, Comcast spokesperson Debbie Frey tells The Verge.\nDirecTV similarly launched a $69.99 per month MySports streaming package last week, which \u2014 unlike Comcast\u2019s bundle \u2014 doesn\u2019t have local CBS content yet and is only available in select cities for now.\nThese new sports-focused packages could help fill the gap left by Venu, the scrapped live sports streaming service led by ESPN, Fox, and Warner Bros.

      "text": "ESPN, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS), and the National Football League (NFL) today announced a non-binding agreement under which ESPN will acquire NFL Network and certain other media assets owned and controlled by the NFL -- including NFL's linear RedZone Channel, and NFL Fantasy -- in exchange for a 10% equity stake in ESPN. In addition to the sale of NFL Network, the NFL and ESPN are also entering into a second non-binding agreement, under which the NFL will license to ESPN certain NFL content and other intellectual property to be used by NFL Network and other assets.\nThese transactions between America's most popular sporting league and the world's most innovative sports media leader are designed to set a new standard for how professional football is delivered, experienced and celebrated by fans.\n\"Today's announcement paves the way for the world's leading sports media brand and America's most popular sport to deliver an even more compelling experience for NFL fans, in a way that only ESPN and Disney can,\" said Robert A. Iger, chief executive officer of The Walt Disney Company. \"Commissioner Goodell and the NFL have built outstanding media assets, and these transactions will add to consumer choice, provide viewers with even greater convenience and quality, and expand the breadth and value proposition of Disney's streaming ecosystem.\"\n\"Since its launch in 2003, NFL Network has provided millions of fans unprecedented access to the sport they love,\" said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. \"Whether it was debuting Thursday Night Football, televising the Combine, or telling incredible football stories through original shows and breaking news, NFL Network has delivered. The Network's sale to ESPN will build on this remarkable legacy, providing more NFL football for more fans in new and innovative ways.\"\n\"This is an exciting day for sports fans,\" said Jimmy Pitaro, chairman of ESPN. \"By combining these NFL media assets with ESPN's reach and innovation, we're creating a premier destination for football fans. Together, ESPN and the NFL are redefining how fans engage with the game -- anytime, anywhere. This deal helps fuel ESPN's digital future, laying the foundation for an even more robust offering as we prepare to launch our new direct-to-consumer service.\"\nAdditional Details\nThis new relationship brings together some of the NFL's premier media brands and fan-engagement platforms with ESPN's deep experience in producing and distributing high-quality and innovative sports programming. ESPN intends to deploy its resources and expertise in the development of NFL Network, distribution of the RedZone Channel and fantasy, to expand audience reach, increase accessibility and flexibility for consumers, drive innovation, and offer even more high-quality content to fans at highly competitive prices. As a result of this sale, NFL programming will be available on more platforms than ever before, including ESPN's upcoming direct-to-consumer (\"DTC\") service, while remaining on cable, satellite and leading streaming providers. ESPN's DTC offering will deliver an array of NFL content to subscribers.\nUnder the terms of these agreements:\n- NFL Network, including both linear and digital rights, would be owned and operated by ESPN and fully integrated into ESPN DTC, alongside traditional pay television distribution, increasing accessibility and flexibility for consumers and promoting innovation in sports programming.\n- ESPN would own broad rights to the RedZone brand and distribute the NFL RedZone Channel to pay TV operators for continued inclusion into their sports packages.\n- NFL Fantasy Football would merge with ESPN Fantasy Football, creating the official Fantasy season-long game of the NFL and one best-in-class digital experience, driving innovation and enabling broader reach to meet global demand.\n- In total, ESPN's platforms will license an additional three NFL games per season to air on NFL Network as a result of today's news. In addition, ESPN will adjust its overall NFL game schedule, with four games (including some from overlapping windows) shifting to NFL Network, which will continue to present seven games per season.\n- The NFL will continue to own and operate its retained media businesses including properties such as NFL Films and key fan-facing platforms such as NFL+, NFL.com, the NFL Podcast Network, the NFL FAST Channel and the official sites for the league's 32 clubs. It will also continue to own, operate, and produce NFL RedZone, and retain the rights to distribute NFL RedZone digitally.\nThe transactions are subject to the parties' negotiation of definitive agreements, various approvals including by the NFL team owners, and customary closing conditions.\nESPN is 80 percent owned by ABC, Inc. (an indirect subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company) and 20 percent by Hearst.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe terms \"Company,\" \"we,\" and \"our\" below and \"Disney\" above are used to refer collectively to The Walt Disney Company and the subsidiaries through which our various businesses are actually conducted.\nCertain statements in this press release may constitute \"forward\u2010looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our expectations, beliefs and business plans; transactions for which conditions to close have not been satisfied, including entering into definitive agreements, regulatory or other approvals or other conditions; content, benefits and timing of future product offerings; consumer sentiment; and other statements that are not historical in nature.
