  "description": "The Baseus Inspire XH1 noise-cancelling headphones, Inspire XC1 open-ear earbuds, and Inspire XP1 earbuds feature Sound by Bose.",
  "content": "Baseus is launching an all-new flagship audio lineup under the Inspire series. It includes three products and the sound is developed in collaboration with Bose. The Baseus Inspire XH1 noise-cancelling headphones, Inspire XC1 open-ear earbuds, and Inspire XP1 earbuds offer a diverse range of form factors, and should fit most people.\n\nThe Baseus Inspire XH1 headphones lead the charge, pairing Sound by Bose with features like Dolby Spatial Audio, Hi-Res certification, and LDAC codec support. They pack angled drivers and optimized chambers, which sport Baseus\u2019 SuperBass 3.0 and SuperBalance 3.0 tuning.\n\nThe Inspire XH1 headphones also feature SoundFit hearing personalization via the Baseus app and an adaptive ANC system capable of cutting up to 48dB of noise. You get a five-mic array, which is said to deliver clear calls even in environments up to 75dB. These headphones are rated to offer up to 100 hours of battery life without ANC, 65 hours with ANC on, and support fast charging to add 12 hours of battery with just 10 minutes of charge.\n\nBaseus is positioning the Inspire XH1 headphones as all-day, all-week gear. For comfort, they feature plush leather earcups and a cloud-like headband. They come in Cosmic Black and Starlight Off-White color options as well as a limited set of Sunset Coral and Twilight Blue finishes. You can get a pair for $149.99 / 170 euros.\n\nThe Baseus Inspire XC1 is one of the first open-ear clip-on earbuds to carry the Sound by Bose badge and house dual drivers. These earbuds feature a 10.8mm dynamic woofer and a Knowles balanced armature tweeter, plus Hi-Res Audio Wireless and LDAC codec support.\n\nThey pack soft memory silicone and weigh 5.5 grams each. The flexible earhooks are claimed to withstand 10,000 bends, while IPX7 water resistance takes care of sweat resistance. You get wind-noise reduction up to 25 km/h, making them fit for runs, rides, and workouts.\n\nThey\u2019re touted to deliver up to 40 hours of battery life with the case, and a 10-minute top-up gives them 2.5 additional hours of battery life. The Inspire XC1 also pack a four-mic ENC system for calls, multipoint connectivity, and app control. They ship in Cosmic Black and Starlight Off-White for $129 / 150 euros.\n\nRounding out the lineup, the Inspire XP1 earbuds combine Sound by Bose with Dolby Spatial Audio and adaptive ANC that\u2019s claimed to reduce up to 50dB of noise. Like the XH1 headphhones, these earbuds feature SuperBass 3.0 and SuperBalance 3.0 tuning.\n\nThe Inspire XP1 earbuds sport an ergonomic design that\u2019s said to mirror the ear\u2019s natural shape, paired with liquid silicone tips for isolation and stability. They feature a six-mic array for call clarity, which is rated to work in 80dB environments.\n\nBattery life clocks in at 8 hours with ANC off and 45 hours with the case. Plus, you can get 2.5 hours worth of battery from a 10-minute charge. They match the prices of XC1, costing $129 / \u20ac150 euros for a pair.\n\nThe Baseus Inspire lineup has a lot going for itself. Their prices undercut traditional high-end players, while offering Dolby audio, Hi-Res, adaptive ANC, and long battery life without a high-end price tag.",

      "text": "After more than a decade of existence, the Dolby Vision HDR standard is getting an upgrade. At IFA 2025, Dolby has announced its new Dolby Vision 2 standard, and no, it won\u2019t make your current TVs obsolete. It includes promise of better highlights, giving more control to the director with \u201cAuthentic Motion\u201d and other behind-the-scenes upgrades on the production side.\nDolby Vision 2 will features a \"redesigned and even more powerful image engine,\u201d alongside new tone mapping and other \u201cnew tools coming to the creative community.\u201d It will let creatives take better advantage of the capabilities of modern TVs.\nWith new Content Intelligence, Dolby Vision 2 is claimed to \u201cintelligently adapt to give the best presentation of the content fine-tuned for your device and viewing environment.\u201d There are three aspects to this:\n- Precision Black, which promises to fix user complaints of the picture being \u201ctoo dark.\u201d Such dark scenes have often looked better without HDR in my experience, but Dolby Vision 2 aims to make them clearer and easier to see in any environment without compromising artistic intent.\n- Light Sense will use ambient light detection sensors on new TVs and reference lighting data from the content source to adjust picture quality according to your ambient room lighting.\n- Sports and Gaming Optimization offers new enhancements such as white point adjustments and motion control designed specifically to address the \u201cunique needs of live sports and gaming.\u201d Motion smoothing has looked terrible on TVs for too long, and Dolby is focusing on solving this with \u201cAuthentic Motion,\u201d which is touted to be the world's first creative-driven motion control tool.\nAuthentic Motion allows the creator/director to choose to add motion smoothing to specific scenes if they feel it's necessary. In a response to CNET, Dolby said, \u201c\"[Authentic Motion allows a creative]\nDolby Vision 2 isn\u2019t available on any current-gen TV. It will be released in two versions: Dolby Vision 2 Max for high-end TVs and the standard Dolby Vision 2 more more affordable TVs. The latter will include the new Dolby Image Engine and Content Intelligence features, while the Max version is said to add \"premium features designed to utilize the full capabilities of these [high-end] displays.\u201d\nHisense will be the first TV brand to introduce Dolby Vision 2 with its upcoming mini-LED TVs. They\u2019ll be powered by MediaTek Pentonic 800 with \u201cMiraVision Pro\u201d PQ Engine, which will be the first silicon chip to integrate Dolby Vision 2."
