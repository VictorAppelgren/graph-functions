  "title": "Will iPhone Prices Go Up? Apple Is Investing $100 Billion in U.S. Manufacturing",
  "description": "Apple made a big pledge at a White House event. But the logistics of creating a gadget like the iPhone, and managing its cost, are complex.",
  "content": "Apple made a big pledge at a White House event. But the logistics of creating a gadget like the iPhone, and managing its cost, are complex.\n\nApple\u2019s pledge to invest an additional $100 billion in the U.S. will create a new U.S. manufacturing program that not only aims to create thousands of jobs, but will also eventually outfit future iPhones and smartwatches with glass screens that are fully made in America.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the new investment Wednesday evening at the White House alongside President Donald Trump. The news notches up Apple\u2019s commitment to invest in the U.S. to a total of $600 billion over the next four years to help shore up domestic manufacturing. Those plans include expansions across nine states (Arizona, California, Iowa, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, and Utah), plus building out a new Texas factory. Apple said it intends to hire 20,000 U.S. workers these next four years, with core focuses among four areas: research and development, silicon engineering, software development, and A.I. There are nine companies so far that are partnering in the new manufacturing program, including the likes of Samsung, Texas Instruments, and Corning. Corning is a manufacturer that makes high-tech glass.\n\nWith a $2.5 billion investment, Apple and Corning will prop up a glass factory in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, which will soon create glass screens for all iPhones and Apple watches. It\u2019s the first time that the glass that forms these gadgets\u2019 screens will be fully created within the U.S. \u201cThis is a significant step toward the ultimate goal of ensuring that iPhones sold in the United States of America also are made in America,\u201d Trump said during Wednesday\u2019s press conference. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is one of the largest commitments in what has become among the greatest investment booms in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d Corning produces Gorilla Glass materials, which cover the fronts of smart phones and tablets, along with Ceramic Shield, another advanced type of glass that\u2019s extremely durable. So when you drop your phone on its face, you should thank Corning if it emerges unscathed.\n\nWhile Apple\u2019s products are designed in California, most of their assembly and production takes place overseas in places like China, according to Evercore ISI. If you flip to the back of a pair of Apple AirPod Pros, an engraving on the case reads: \u201cDesigned by Apple in California. Assembled in Vietnam.\u201d It makes sense that the White House is quick to tout the investment and pile it into the accomplishments of the Trump administration. It\u2019s not easy to convince large companies to bring domestic manufacturing back home to the U.S. when they\u2019ve done so at a discount overseas. But with the new sling of tariffs unveiled by the administration, some companies have been left with little choice. What remains unclear is how Wednesday\u2019s news will affect iPhone pricing.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone has long been a premium product in the smartphone market. But when adjusted for inflation, iPhone pricing has, with a few exceptions, remained relatively stable over the years. The open question remaining is if that trend can continue as Apple lures more of its assembly line back to the U.S.",

Learn more.\niPhone price history: How Apple's pricing changes (inflation included)\nNovember 18, 2024\nThe iPhone has been around for 17 years, and in that time, its number of features and (seemingly) its price have also increased. But just how much has the price of the iPhone actually changed through time? We\u2019ll take a look at the price history of the iPhone and consider inflation to find out.\nQuick Answer\nThe original iPhone debuted in 2007 and started at $499, which, when adjusted for inflation, is $760 in 2024. For comparison, the recent iPhone 16 starts at $799. So, the iPhone has gotten slightly more expensive but is roughly comparable.\nWhat did the first iPhone cost?\nWhen Apple introduced the first iPhone in 2007, it was met with some skepticism. While people liked the touch screen and camera, the phone\u2019s $499 starting price was seen as too expensive for some.\nFast-forward to today, and people still say the $799 iPhone 15 introduced in 2023 is also too expensive. At first glance, it looks that way, but we have to take into account inflation. When considering inflation, particularly the consumer price index, we can see that all products tend to cost more over time, especially recently. As a result, the price history of the iPhone should theoretically also follow this trend.\nIf we use an inflation calculator to see how much the original iPhone\u2019s price of $499 in 2007 dollars would be today, we get a result of around $755. While that is slightly less expensive than the $799 starting price of the iPhone 15 in 2023, it\u2019s not by a large amount.\niPhone price history through the years\nThere\u2019s still more to the story regarding the price history of the iPhone. To fully understand the developments, let\u2019s look at the price upon introduction and adjust it for inflation of every generation of iPhone.\nNote that we\u2019re considering the base models of the iPhone for each generation, and these prices assume you also signed up for a contract at the time of purchase. We\u2019re also looking at the price of iPhones in the USA for comparison, as the retail price of the handset can vary in different parts of the world.\nFirst-generation iPhone (2007)\n- First-gen iPhone original starting MSRP: $499\n- Inflation-adjusted first-gen iPhone price: $760\niPhone 3G (2008)\n- iPhone 3G original starting MSRP: $199\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 3G price: $292\niPhone 3GS (2009)\n- iPhone 3GS original starting MSRP: $199\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 3GS price: $293\niPhone 4 (2010)\n- iPhone 4 original starting MSRP: $199\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 4 price: $289\niPhone 4S (2011)\n- iPhone 4S original starting MSRP: $199\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 4S price: $280\niPhone 5 (2012)\n- iPhone 5 Original starting MSRP: $199\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 5 price: $276\niPhone 5S/5C (2013)\n- iPhone 5S original starting MSRP: $199\n- iPhone 5C original starting MSRP: $99\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 5S price: $270\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 5C price: $134\niPhone 6/6 Plus (2014)\n- iPhone 6 original starting MSRP: $199\n- iPhone 6 Plus original starting MSRP: $299\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 6 price: $266\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 6 Plus price: $398\niPhone 6S/6S Plus (2015)\n- iPhone 6S original starting MSRP: $199\n- iPhone 6S Plus original starting MSRP: $299\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 6S price: $265\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 6S Plus price: $397\niPhone 7/7 Plus (2016)\n- iPhone 7 original starting MSRP: $649\n- iPhone 7 Plus original starting MSRP: $769\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 7 price: $854\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 7 Plus price: $1,011\niPhone 8/8 Plus (2017)\n- iPhone 8 original starting MSRP: $699\n- iPhone 8 Plus original starting MSRP: $799\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 8 price: $900\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 8 Plus price: $1,029\niPhone X (2017)\n- iPhone X original starting MSRP: $999\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone X Plus price: $1,287\niPhone XR (2018)\n- iPhone XR original starting MSRP: $749\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone XR Plus price: $942\niPhone XS/S Max (2018)\n- iPhone XS original starting MSRP: $999\n- iPhone XS Max original starting MSRP: $1,099\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone XS price: $1,254\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone XS Plus price: $1,380\niPhone 11/Pro/Pro Max (2019)\n- iPhone 11 original starting MSRP: $699\n- iPhone 11 Pro original starting MSRP: $999\n- iPhone 11 Pro Max original starting MSRP: $1099\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 11 price: $863\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 11 Pro price: $1,232\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 11 Pro Max price: $1,355\niPhone 12/Mini/Pro/Pro Max (2020)\n- iPhone 12 original starting MSRP: $799\n- iPhone 12 Mini original starting MSRP: $699\n- iPhone 12 Pro original starting MSRP: $999\n- iPhone 12 Pro Max original starting MSRP: $1099\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 12 price: $976\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 12 Mini price: $853\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 12 Pro price: $1,218\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 12 Pro Max price: $1,340\niPhone 13/Mini/Pro/Pro Max (2021)\n- iPhone 13 original starting MSRP: $799\n- iPhone 13 Mini original starting MSRP: $699\n- iPhone 13 Pro original starting MSRP: $999\n- iPhone 13 Pro Max original starting MSRP: $1099\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 13 price: $931\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 13 Mini price: $814\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 13 Pro price: $1,163\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 13 Pro Max price: $1,279\niPhone 14/Plus/Pro/Pro Max (2022)\n- iPhone 14 original starting MSRP: $799\n- iPhone 14 Plus original starting MSRP: $899\n- iPhone 14 Pro original starting MSRP: $999\n- iPhone 14 Pro Max original starting MSRP: $1,099\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 14 price: $861\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 14 Plus price: $969\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 14 Pro price: $1,077\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 14 Pro Max price: $1,184\niPhone 15/Plus/Pro/Pro Max (2023)\n- iPhone 15 original starting MSRP: $799\n- iPhone 15 Plus original starting MSRP: $899\n- iPhone 15 Pro original starting MSRP: $999\n- iPhone 15 Pro Max original starting MSRP: $1,199\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 15 price: $827\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 15 Plus price: $931\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 15 Pro price: $1,035\n- Inflation-adjusted iPhone 15 Pro Max price: $1,242\niPhone 16/Plus/Pro/Pro Max (2024 \u2014 no inflation adjustment)\n- iPhone 16 original starting MSRP: $799\n- iPhone 16 Plus original starting MSRP: $899\n- iPhone 16 Pro original starting MSRP: $999\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max original starting MSRP: $1,199\nAre iPhones getting more expensive?\nAs we can see from the iPhone\u2019s price history above, there was a time when the iPhone was indeed cheaper in terms of inflation-adjusted prices. But that was mainly because you had to sign up for a two-year contract with the iPhone 2 right up to the iPhone 6. Those days ended around 2016 when the price of the base model iPhone 7 without a contract jumped to $649 at release or $854 in 2024 dollars.\nEver since then, the price of the iPhone has tended to track rather closely with inflation. In fact, the models fall below the inflation-adjusted prices of their predecessors at times. Given the relatively high inflation of the last few years and the largely unchanged price of the iPhone 16 series, it is effectively cheaper than its predecessor in real terms.\nFrequently asked questions about the price history of the iPhone\nIn terms of raw numbers, it may appear the iPhone 16 is more expensive than older iPhone models. But when considering inflation, the price of the iPhone has more or less kept pace with inflation since around 2016.\nApple sometimes puts older model iPhones on sale, though not always. Plus, you can often find good deals on the iPhone from mobile service providers, such as getting an iPhone 16 for free upon signing up for a contract.\nThank you for being part of our community.
