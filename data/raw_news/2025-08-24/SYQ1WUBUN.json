  "description": "NASA plans to establish a nuclear reactor on the moon, but it isn't the only one. Here's why world powers are racing against each other to get create a foothold",
  "content": "Is NASA Building A Nuclear Reactor On The Moon? Here's What We Know\n\nNASA is bringing nuclear energy to the moon. According to internal agency documents obtained by Politico in August 2025, Interim NASA Administrator Sean Duffy looks to place a 100-kilowatt nuclear generator on the moon by 2030. The plan comes after China and Russia announced a joint venture to launch a lunar nuclear power plant by 2035, and is seen by many as the next domino in an escalating space race between the world's premier powers. Sending a nuclear reactor into space is nothing new. The practice dates back to the Cold War, when the U.S. launched the first nuclear reactor into space in 1965. Since then, Russian and American scientists have used thermoelectric generators extensively, powering select satellites, the Mars Rover, and the Voyager probes. Nuclear energy presents several advantages over the solar panels used by most low Earth orbit satellites, particularly in areas like the moon where sunlight is inconsistent.The Trump administration has had its eyes on a lunar reactor since its first term, although its progress then was minimal. In 2021, under the Biden administration, NASA announced it would launch a lunar reactor \"within a decade,\" only to revise the claim to the mid-2030s by 2024. Mass budget cuts, labor shortages, and an influx of high-profile projects like the Artemis 3 lunar landing will likely make it difficult for NASA to meet the President's audacious timeline. And while a longer project timeline may ease these difficulties, time is the defining factor for this administration, as the U.S. seeks to beat its Eastern rivals to the moon once again. As an anonymous senior NASA official told Politico, \"It is about winning the second space race.\"\n\nScientists believe that nuclear energy is critical to America's lunar ambitions. While solar is sufficient in powering low Earth orbit operations, the moon's slow rotation speed causes its surface to experience fourteen consecutive days of darkness at a time. This scarcity of sunlight renders solar power inefficient, with most lunar rovers lacking the energy stores to make it through a single lunar night. Nuclear reactors present an intriguing alternative. Although the 100-kilowatt reactor is smaller than most commercial nuclear plants, experts predict that it may generate the equivalent of 70 to 80 homes, powering several lunar operations, including enclosed habitats, research outposts, lunar rovers, 3D printers, and life support systems. According to Dr. Bhavya Lal, a former associate administrator at NASA, the reactor, like America's 94 commercial reactors, will convert the heat of a controlled reaction of uranium fuel into energy. However, the Moon's lack of an atmosphere or water supplies complicates this process, as plants use vast stores of water to cool reactors while expelling excess heat into the atmosphere. NASA will need to build massive radiators to offload this extra heat. Harsh environmental factors make a lunar reactor much more complicated. Its lack of an atmosphere means that components must operate in a vacuum. Extreme temperatures are also a concern, as the moon's surface temperature ranges between 250 and -400 degrees Fahrenheit. Moonquakes and meteorite strikes, meanwhile, could threaten the reactor's structural integrity.\n\nGetting off the ground To get a reactor to the moon, NASA will likely have to depend on SpaceX's Starship program, which the Elon Musk-led company touts as the world's most powerful rocket system. However, depending on SpaceX to execute this mission is no longer a given, as the Starship rocket kicked off 2025 with four straight explosions and counting. Whether SpaceX can meet the agency's short deadline is a major concern in light of these uncharacteristic setbacks. Already, the company is struggling to meet NASA's 2027 Artemis 3 lunar mission deadline \u2014 a project NASA paid SpaceX $4 billion to complete. These recent setbacks are an optics nightmare for a nuclear program. Sean Duffy, who also serves as the Secretary of Transportation, stresses that the rocket won't be carrying a live reactor, while industry professionals echoed that it likely wouldn't activate until a safe orbiting distance 621 miles above Earth's surface. Katheryn Huff, a professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who served as the Biden Administration's assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the Department of Energy, posited that the greater concern may be disposing of the reactor after its lifespan. Reentry into the Earth's atmosphere has proven a difficult for nuclear programs. One example Huff highlights is the 1978 Kosmos 954 disaster, in which a Russian nuclear-powered satellite exploded upon reentry and scattered nuclear debris across Canada.\n\nIf you're not first, you're last Several legal structures will govern this next stage of space exploration and resource management. On the most basic level, a lunar reactor is legal under the U.N.'s 1992 Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Space, which allows nuclear power when other sources prove inefficient. But experts believe the rationale behind the U.S.'s furious lunar push is rooted in a different U.N. edict: the 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibiting territorial claims on the moon. While the treaty bans settlements, Article IX requires that countries respect each other's infrastructure, stating that each must act with \"due regard to corresponding interests of all other State Parties.\" According to Michelle L.D. Hanlon, a professor of air and space law at the University of Mississippi, the stipulation \"means if one country places a nuclear reactor on the Moon, others must navigate around it, legally and physically. In effect, it draws a line on the lunar map.\" In this way, space infrastructure becomes a quasi-workaround for countries looking to control lunar sites. While there's been talk about melting roads onto the moon to facilitate easier travel, Hanlon predicts that countries will likely race to establish infrastructure in resource-rich regions like the lunar south pole to cement and prohibit access. Duffy confirmed this rationale during a U.S. Department of Transportation press conference, that NASA's push is all about getting there first. \"There's a certain part of the moon that everyone knows is the best,\" he said, \"We have ice there. We have sunlight there. We want to get there first and claim that for America.\"\n\nDuffy's directive has one rival nation in mind: China. As the administrator stated in an August press conference, the U.S. is \"in a race with China to the moon. And to have a base on the moon, we need energy.\" As it stands, NASA's 2030 timeline corresponds with China's plans to land its first astronauts on the moon that same year. In April 2025, Beijing announced it would build a lunar nuclear plant by 2035. The project, first announced by Russia in 2024, would power the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) \u2013 a partnership between the two powers and 15 additional nation-states and international organizations. Beijing's announcement comes as its lunar program approaches several key milestones, including the 2028 Chang'e-8 mission to test technologies for lunar base construction. Russia, for its part, looks to play a large role in this next era of space exploration. In particular, Chinese officials have touted its nuclear space pact with Russia as a distinct advantage, with Wu Weiren, chief designer of China's lunar program, saying Russia \"leads the world\" in nuclear space reactors, proclaiming \"it is ahead of the United States.\" Some see lunar infrastructure as an opportunity for cooperation, rather than exclusion. So far, however, the U.S. hasn't announced if it will partner with any nation-states in its reactor project. Rather, the agency seems to be broadly leaning towards commercial partnerships, with its premier collaborative space effort, the International Space Station, set to be replaced by commercial stations in 2030. Taking Duffy's directive at face value, NASA's primary concern may be preserving its spot at the table rather than inviting others to join it, as it stresses the need for NASA to build its reactor before a rival can \"declare a 'keep-out' zone.\"\n\nScientists have criticized the plan in light of NASA's dire budget crisis. As Joseph Cirincione, a nuclear expert and vice-chair of the Center for International Policy, told the Independent, \"The whole proposal is cock-eyed and runs against the sound management of a space program that is now being starved of money.\" According to Cirincione, a more realistic date would be 2045. Katheryn Huff, meanwhile, notes that this accelerated timeline will cut short a multiyear bidding, authorization, and input-gathering process, potentially causing the project to prioritize other concerns over scientific ones. Some, however, have expressed optimism regarding the plan. Former NASA administrator Dr. Bhavya Lal, for instance, said that the timeline is possible but will require roughly $3 billion over five years. Whether NASA can afford such an investment remains uncertain, as the agency faces historic budget cuts and labor shortages. Under the President's 2026 budget request, NASA is facing the single biggest cut in its history, dropping its funding by 24% to 18.8 billion \u2013 its lowest inflation-adjusted budget since 1961. Nearly halving NASA's science budget, it cancels 41 projects, including the Mars Sample Return, New Horizons, and Juno space exploration missions. Amplifying these concerns are questions surrounding NASA's workforce. After the administration's deferred resignation program saw a fifth of the agency leave for greener pastures, the 2026 budget looks to further reduce NASA's staff by nearly a third. It's important to note, however, that Congress continues to debate this budget, with several senators pushing back on the cuts. NASA's next step will be to designate a project lead for the reactor. Following the appointment, it will spend the next 60 days soliciting industry and interagency input. From there, interest will only continue to build around more trips to the moon.",

      "text": "How Far Away Is Voyager 1, The Most Distant Manmade Object From Earth?\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nVoyager 1 was launched into space in 1977 and has been on a one-way journey ever since, pushing the boundaries of how far a machine built by human hands can travel. Launched from Florida like most NASA craft, Voyager 1 is now over 15 billion miles away from Earth, which means a 23-hour wait for radio signals to travel to and from mission control. The only other man-made object nearly that far away is its sibling, Voyager 2. For context, 15 billion miles is equal to more than 31,000 round trips to the moon.\nBoth Voyagers are still moving quickly away from the Sun and into the cold, silent emptiness of interstellar space. Voyager 1 is traveling about 38,000 mph to the north (relative to the sun) and Voyager 2 is moving about 34,000 mph in the opposite direction. In 2012, Voyager crossed the heliopause (the outermost part of our sun's radioactive zone) and became the first object made by humans to reach interstellar space. Despite the vast distance, Voyager 1 continues to gather data and send it back to Earth. These fading whispers travel light-years across the cosmic void, representing postcards from the realm of the unknown and unseen.\nHow much closer is Voyager 2?\nIf Voyager 1 is the express bus to the outer reaches of space, Voyager 2 is the intrepid explorer that took the scenic route. Launched about two weeks earlier than its lower-numbered brother, Voyager 2 is currently a few billion miles closer to us thanks to its different itinerary. Instead of heading straight for the far reaches of space, Voyager 2 first toured Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, becoming the only spacecraft ever to visit all four gas giants.\nAs of this writing, Voyager 2 is around 12.9 billion miles from Earth. It crossed into interstellar space in 2018, around six years behind its sibling, and it's still sending back readings from a different slice of the cosmic pie. While the two probes drift in opposite directions \u2014 Voyager 1 to the north of the solar plane and Voyager 2 to the south \u2014 their missions are still united. They're mapping the unknown and doing science from places no one has ever been. NASA was even able to xtagstartza href=\"https://www.slashgear.com/1611283/how-nasa-fixed-voyager-1-from-15-billion-miles-away/\nWhat is the purpose of Voyager 1?\nVoyager 1's mission was to capture the outer reaches of our solar system up close, and breaking distance and longevity records is just a byproduct of its success. In its early days, Voyager delivered breathtaking images and valuable scientific data from Jupiter and Saturn, including our first detailed look at the rings around Saturn and the gnarly weather conditions on its largest moon, Titan. Those flybys alone were worth the trip, but the spacecraft had more to give. After it completed its tour of the planets, Voyager 1 became a pathfinder into unexplored space. The probe continues to send back important data, giving us an insight into the mysteries of the galaxy we can't get from terra firma.\nThe two Voyager spacecraft are also ambassadors from our planet and its people. The Golden Records on each Voyager carry a series of multilingual greetings, sounds from Earth, and music from Bach to Chuck Berry. That makes Voyager 1 more than just a robotic explorer; it's a representation of humanity carrying the message \"We were here\" to anyone we might be sharing the universe with. If you're curious about Voyager's message, Amazon sells print and audio CDs of Carl Sagan's Murmurs of Earth, a chronicle of the golden record project with samples of some of the messages it carries.\nWhen will Voyager 1 stop transmitting information back to Earth?\nDespite their nearly 50 years of operation, the Voyager crafts aren't meant to carry on forever. Each one runs on a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), a nuclear battery that slowly loses power over time. Every year the Voyagers lose about 4 watts of capacity, and someday the groundbreaking Voyager 1 mission will come to an end. To stretch the mission of both Voyagers as long as possible, NASA has been carefully switching off instruments one by one, starting with heaters and moving on to scientific tools.\nVoyager 2 started powering down devices back in 2020 since it's carrying one more sensor than Voyager 1. Right now, they're both running on just a few key instruments, prioritizing data from the interstellar environment. The current estimates are that scientific instruments will probably go dark sometime in 2025, but the two spacecraft could still send back proof-of-life signals until 2036.\nEven after they go silent, both Voyagers will keep flying. Voyager 1 is headed toward the constellation Ophiuchus, while Voyager 2 is coasting toward a small star in Andromeda. In about 40,000 years, each will pass within a few light-years of these interstellar targets. They won't see anything. They won't stop. But they'll be there drifting through the dark, carrying echoes of who we were to potential distant neighbors."

According to Duffy, the reactor is part of a new space race, one with the ultimate goal of establishing a sustained human presence on the moon.\n\"We're in a race to the moon, in a race with China to the moon. And to have a base on the moon, we need energy,\" Duffy told reporters in response to a question about reports that surfaced earlier in the week about his ambitious directive to launch a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor to the moon by 2030. Such a reactor would produce roughly the same amount of energy as an average U.S. household uses every 3.5 days.\nDuffy went further than simply saying he wants the United States to beat China to the moon, however. The acting NASA chief said that he wants the U.S. to claim the \"best\" part of the moon for itself.\n\"There's a certain part of the moon that everyone knows is the best,\" Duffy said. \"We have ice there. We have sunlight there. We want to get there first and claim that for America.\"\nBecause the moon rotates so slowly, the lunar surface experiences two weeks of darkness at at a time. That means solar power won't be efficient to power a crewed outpost \u2014 most robotic lunar rovers can't even survive the lunar night.\nIn addition, NASA and other international space agencies are interested in establishing bases in the moon's south polar region, near permanently shadowed craters where water ice is thought to be abundant. But because these areas are permanently dark, solar power won't cut it. Having another source of energy production could enable human explorers to venture into new areas where the sun literally doesn't shine.\nDuffy was quick to point out that putting a nuclear reactor on the moon doesn't mean launching an active reactor atop a rocket. \"We're not launching this live. That's obviously \u2014 if you have any questions about that, no, we're not launching it live,\" Duffy pointed out.\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!\nNASA plans on returning human explorers to the surface of the moon with its Artemis 3 mission, currently scheduled for no earlier than mid-2027. That mission will see a yet-to-be-named crew land near the moon's south pole for a six-day stay on the lunar surface \u2014 twice as long as the Apollo astronauts spent on the moon.\nThe interim NASA administrator went on to compare the two moon exploration programs, downplaying the public reach of his agency's own Artemis program. \"A lot of people don't know even what Artemis is. Everyone knew what Apollo was. We all knew. The whole world knew what Apollo was.

      "text": "SpaceX Will Destroy The ISS \u2013 Here's What We Know About The Plan\nEverything must come to an end sooner or later, even if it's something as beloved and significant as the International Space Station. The station still has some time left before NASA needs to properly dismantle and take it out of Earth's orbit, but a plan needs to be in place for the process otherwise there's significant risk. The station is solidly built and will remain in Earth's lower orbit until 2030. The space agency needs to be ready before it comes time for the last crew to depart the station. This isn't NASA's first rodeo with deorbiting a space station, as the national agency learned quite a few things from its own Skylab station in 1979 and Russia's Mir station in 2001.\nIn preparation for the ISS's eventual end of life, NASA selected SpaceX to develop the US deorbiting vehicle that will safely remove the station from Earth's orbit. A number of alternatives were explored before settling on deorbiting the ISS, which is a nice way of saying it's going to be destroyed. NASA considered an uncontrolled re-entry, but the ISS is nearly the size of an American football field. Without the ability to maneuver the space station, it could crash on a populated region.\nKen Bowersox, the agency's director of space operations, said, \"Selecting a U.S. De-orbit Vehicle for the International Space Station (ISS) will help NASA and its international partners ensure a safe and responsible transition in low Earth orbit at the end of station operations.\"\nWhat the deorbiting plan entails\nThere are no specifics about the deorbiting vehicle's design yet. SpaceX might take the $843 million NASA awarded it to adapt an existing Dragon spacecraft to get the job done or it might build a whole new vehicle from scratch. What is known is that the deorbiting vehicle will launch roughly a year before the International Space Station's expiration date, while astronauts are still living aboard, and attach itself to it. Those still aboard would gradually depart and return to Earth throughout that year until the station is completely vacant for the first time in 30 years.\nAs the ISS's orbit naturally decays, the deorbiting \"tugboat\" will conduct a series of burns to maneuver it to a position in Earth's atmosphere where it and any debris that falls off will crash into parts of the Pacific Ocean that aren't densely populated. The station's final resting place is a secluded place in the Pacific dubbed Point Nemo, over 1,500 miles (2,500 km) from land. This is a point in the ocean farthest from any piece of land.\nIt's not as easy as developing a vehicle that can safely bring the space station down to Earth. That's the easy part. Scientific American reported that NASA told SpaceX that the vehicle needs to be able to accomplish its mission even if up to two components fail. Right now, the ISS unassumingly orbits Earth, visible to the naked eye (if you know where to look), but its final descent will be a funeral pyre on display for the world."

      "text": "Scientists Are Planning To Melt Roads On The Moon Using Lasers - Here's How\nOne of the biggest challenges in establishing a habitat on the moon, Mars, or any other body in the solar system is the need for critical infrastructure before dreams of human settlement can come to life. It's a monumental task to carry all the raw materials and required machinery to the moon, but even if that is made possible by massive vehicles like SpaceX's Starship in the near future, we would need roads for ferrying it all across the lunar surface and avoiding the hazards created by mobile moondust.\nBut that moondust can be turned into the solution itself. After all, scientists have emphasized that extra-Earth habitats will rely on local resource utilization. Experts at Germany's Aalen University, BAM Institute of Materials Research and Testing, Clausthal University of Technology, and the German Aerospace Center are working with Austria's LIQUIFER Systems Group on an idea that involves melting that lunar dust to make solid material for roads.\nTo put it more specifically, the team seeks to melt the surface regolith to create thin blocks with a specific shape that can be used to design interlocking pieces for roads and landing pads. The inspiration behind the tests was 'PAVER' (Paving the road for large area sintering of regolith), which is backed by the European Space Agency. It envisioned using a large lens to concentrate sunlight and use the energized beam to melt the material to make solid pieces.\nHow it all works\nTo recreate the effect of using a lens for concentrating sunlight, scientists behind this experiment used a 12-kilowatt carbon dioxide laser on a material mimicking the dusty lunar surface. The immense heat produced by the laser beam melted the raw material and turned it into a glassy or crystalline solid. The strength of the material was found to be close to that of concrete. When it comes to applying the technique on the moon, the team hopes to replicate the laser's energy using a Fresnel lens to be carried to the moon in the near future.\nThe lens, which needs to measure 2.37 square meters across to achieve the desired power, would act as a sunlight concentrator to create an energy beam with a 45mm diameter and a material thickness target of 15-20 millimeters, according to the study. In the long run, the team hopes to use the laser-sintered moondust to make solid 3D structures such as habitats for astronomers, hangars, and storage units.\nScientists are hoping that structures made from this material will also shield the habitats from micrometeorites and harmful radiation, which is extremely important because the moon lacks an atmosphere that can block it. Carrying powerful laser equipment necessary for making crystalline blocks to the moon isn't feasible, but a lens that doubles as a light concentrator would be far easier, and it also solves a multitude of problems, including energy generation and supply requirements.\nLong road ahead\nDuring the tests, the team managed to create hollow-centered geometric shapes of roughly 2.5 meters that can be interlocked to create a solid surface for landing sites or paths. As promising as it all sounds, and assuming it's possible to put a sunlight-concentrating lens on the moon in the immediate future, the process of building the necessary road infrastructure could take years. \"The team estimates a 100 sq. m landing pad with a thickness of 2 cm of dense material might be constructed in 115 days,\" says an ESA press release.\nThis won't be the first project of its kind, however. As part of another ESA-supported project, a team 3D-printed bricks made out of material similar to moondust using concentrated sunlight. The charred bricks created as part of the tests had a material strength similar to that of Gypsum, which is used in plaster, tiles, and cement as a building material. The moon itself is no stranger to the phenomenon. There is an abundance of glassy beads in the lunar soil, which are said to have formed under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure resulting from an impact event.\nThe biggest benefit of making solid roads using lunar regolith is that it solves the problem of moondust, which not only damages vehicles and other equipment but also poses a danger to spacesuits. But given its natural availability as a raw material, the latest approach also solves the logistics headache and saves billions of dollars."

      "text": "Why There Haven't Been More Trips To The Moon, According To Astronauts\nThe year 2022 marked the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 17 mission and the last time humans landed on the moon. When NASA formally launched its Artemis program in 2017, not only to take astronauts back to the moon but also to build a lunar south pole base and establish a permanent presence, it raised an inevitable question: what took so long?\nNASA kept busy after its Apollo days with space exploration missions like Voyager 1 and 2, both launched in 1977 to survey the Jupiter and Saturn systems, as well as the Viking 1 and 2 missions to Mars, and the Pioneer missions that traveled to Venus. These efforts all had elements in common: they were relatively small, low cost, and offered a high scientific return on investment. The first space race against Russia was over and NASA was working within a budget, maximizing results for every dollar spent.\nDuring the '80s, a new space race aimed to dominate low-Earth orbit and conquer the space where the world's satellites operate. NASA explains that it had been given the green light by the Nixon administration to develop the Space Shuttle program, and in 1981 the Shuttle was ready for its first launch. The culmination of this space race ended with a truce in the form of the International Space Station, a beacon of international cooperation with the main two competitors, Russia and the U.S., working side by side.\nSpace exploration in the '80s, '90s, and 2000s, just like in the '50s, '60s, and '70s, was shaped by international political events happening on Earth.\nWhat astronauts have to say about the delay\nIn 2019, Insider reported that astronauts believed budget and politics were the main barriers that kept humanity away from returning to the moon. \"If it wasn't for the political risk, we would be on the moon right now,\" former NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine told Insider. \"In fact, we would probably be on Mars,\" Bridenstine added.\nNASA legend and astronaut Buzz Aldrin testified before the Senate Subcommittee on Space, Science, and Competitiveness on February 24, 2015, reading from a written statement that warned that returning to the moon would only be possible with the support of Congress and the administration. \"American leadership is inspiring the world by consistently doing what no other nation is capable of doing. We demonstrated that for a brief time 45 years ago. I do not believe we have done it since. I believe it begins with a bi-partisan Congressional and Administration commitment to sustained leadership,\" (via Senate.gov).\nBusiness Insider also interviewed Apollo astronauts Rusty Schweickart and Harrison Schmitt in 2019 during an event to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Speaking about the Artemis program, Schweickart said, \"Accelerating something that ambitious is a real challenge, and it takes commitment and dollars. We've tried two other times \u2014 administrations have tried \u2014 and they've been stillborn.\" Astronaut Schmitt added that in order for a moon program to succeed, it needs to recreate the Apollo work environment that was filled with young, energetic, and ambitious people.\nDuring his own testimony to Congress in 2015, astronaut Walter Cunningham said, \"Manned exploration is the most expensive space venture and, consequently, the most difficult for which to obtain political support.\" Cunningham reminded Congress that NASA's budget during the Apollo days peaked at 4% of the federal budget but remained below 1% percent for the past 40 years. \"Any project as complex as Apollo requires three things: resources, technology, and \u2014 most important \u2014 the will to do it,\" Cunningham added.\nArtemis is a whole new approach to funding space travel\nWith the question of how expensive space exploration will be paid for still looming, and reluctance in the US government for taxpayers to foot the whole bill of developing a whole new space program, NASA took a different strategy. The Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) aims to use public-private partnerships to make the cost of returning to space more affordable. Instead of developing everything in-house, NASA works with the commercial space sector to help fund the development of commercial space capabilities that could also benefit future NASA missions.\nThat approach will be instrumental for Artemis, and America's return to the moon. Though NASA is responsible for the program, it's working with companies like SpaceX, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and others on different elements of the hardware involved. SpaceX, for example, will be providing the Starship that NASA astronauts will use as their moon lander in 2024; they'll travel to the Lunar Gateway in an Orion spacecraft atop an SLS rocket, on which the US space agency collaborated with Aerojet Rocketdyne, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and the United Launch Alliance.\nArtemis still won't be cheap, even with NASA's reliance on private partnerships. Earlier this year, NASA Inspector General Paul Martin admitted to the House Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics that each of the first four Artemis launches were on track to cost $4.1 billion apiece, CNBC reported, as the multi-year project spiraled over budget. In a NASA audit released in late 2021, the space agency projected it would spend $93 billion on the project through 2025."

      "text": "How Many SpaceX Rockets Have Exploded So Far In 2025?\nWhen a SpaceX Starship rocket went up in a fiery explosion in June 2025, it amplified criticism regarding the company's recent string of test failures. This was the fourth straight failure of the Elon Musk-led company's Starship rocket, which is set to play a crucial role in NASA's upcoming lunar landing mission set for 2027 \u2014 a contract that netted SpaceX $4 billion. Unfortunately, these mishaps have occurred at a critical juncture for SpaceX, as the company plans to significantly ramp up its launches.\nOn top of that, rumors that SpaceX will join the United States' Golden Dome missile defense system, and its goals of leaving for Mars by 2026, have elevated scrutiny of the Austin-based space giant. Some regulators expressed concern about the unsuccessful launches, with the FAA ordering an investigation in January 2025 and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum threatening to sue the company over contamination caused by launch debris. Musk, conversely, has shrugged off the mishaps, calling the June 2025 explosion \"just a scratch\" on X.\nMuch of the concern is a matter of optics: high-profile explosions of SpaceX rockets take on new meaning when the stated goal is interplanetary settlement. With visions of settlers on the first mission to Mars firmly in SpaceX's sightlines, it's no wonder the public is more concerned with SpaceX's headline-grabbing disasters than the 430-plus successful landings of its Falcon 9. However, with five explosions this year alone, many are beginning to speculate about the toll these failures may take on the world's most lucrative space company.\nA near flawless record, with notable hiccups\nWhile SpaceX rockets' failures bombard the news cycle whenever their rockets scatter across the ocean, the company boasts an impressive success rate, with the Falcon 9 holding a 99% launch success rate since 2010. The latest version maintained a flawless record between May 2018 and July 2024, with nearly 300 launches occurring without a hitch.\nSpaceX has launched 96 Falcon 9s, the backbone of its Starlink satellite program, as of July 2025. One of these exploded in space, with SpaceX losing another Falcon as it landed from a successful mission. The first was in February 2025, when a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 22 Starlink satellites experienced a liquid oxygen leak, disrupting the rocket's deorbit processes and resulting in fiery debris falling over Poland. In the other instance, an otherwise successful Starlink mission ended when a damaged booster tipped the Falcon 9 onto its side during landing.\nThe main issue in 2025 has been the world's most powerful rocket, SpaceX's Starship program. Designed to carry passengers to extraterrestrial destinations, Musk stated in March 2025 that SpaceX aims to send its Starship rocket to Mars by the end of 2026, with a potential landing date between 2029 and 2031. Unfortunately, recent results may suggest otherwise. Thus far, four straight Starship launches have ended in explosions. The most recent of which occurred in June 2025, at its Starbase site in Massey, Texas, raising the company's yearly total to five. For reference, the global space community saw six failed orbital launches in 2024. SpaceX, however, remains undeterred, firing up the latest Starship test on July 31, 2025.\nWhat these failures mean for SpaceX\nTypically, SpaceX publicly hails mission failures as learning experiences. SpaceX's success makes it difficult to argue against Musk's \"fail fast, learn fast\" mindset, as the company accounted for over half of the world's successful orbital launches in 2024. Some experts, however, question whether this will be the case for the Starship program. Starship launches are likely more expensive than the Falcon 9's $67 million price tag, with some estimating each launch costs around $100 million.\nEnvironmental concerns have begun to add financial risks, evidenced by the Bahamas' pause of its Falcon 9 landing deal after a Starship explosion cascaded debris across the island. Add mounting delays caused by regulatory investigations, and each successive explosion paints a worrisome financial picture. Musk stated in 2019 that the total program would cost up to $10 billion; the program reportedly already passed the $5 billion mark in 2023.\nThe biggest consequence, however, may be that these explosions tarnish SpaceX's veneer of invincibility as it ventures towards a time of immense economic potential amidst intense public scrutiny. Already, SpaceX appears unlikely to meet NASA's 2027 Artemis deadline. Earlier this year, SpaceX delayed a critical demonstration, fueling further speculation. Despite these setbacks, NASA remains bullish on the project, awarding Starship a launch services contract in March 2025. Billions more could be on the line in the coming months, with Reuters reporting that President Trump's June 2025 review of SpaceX contracts could cost the company $22 billion. Whether confidence in SpaceX can withstand more fiery explosions may become an increasingly important question as the company ventures into the second half of one of its most important years yet."

      "text": "The first space race was about flags and footprints. Now, decades later, landing on the Moon is old news. The new race is to build there, and doing so hinges on power.\nIn April 2025, China reportedly unveiled plans to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2035. This plant would support its planned international lunar research station. The United States countered in August, when acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy reportedly suggested a U.S. reactor would be operational on the Moon by 2030.\nWhile it might feel like a sudden sprint, this isn\u2019t exactly breaking news. NASA and the Department of Energy have spent years quietly developing small nuclear power systems to power lunar bases, mining operations and long-term habitats.\nAs a space lawyer focused on long-term human advancement into space, I see this not as an arms race but as a strategic infrastructure race. And in this case, infrastructure is influence.\nA lunar nuclear reactor may sound dramatic, but its neither illegal nor unprecedented. If deployed responsibly, it could allow countries to peacefully explore the Moon, fuel their economic growth and test out technologies for deeper space missions. But building a reactor also raises critical questions about access and power.\nThe legal framework already exists\nNuclear power in space isn\u2019t a new idea. Since the 1960s, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have relied on radioisotope generators that use small amounts of radioactive elements \u2013 a type of nuclear fuel \u2013 to power satellites, Mars rovers and the Voyager probes.\nThe United Nations\u2019 1992 Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space, a nonbinding resolution, recognizes that nuclear energy may be essential for missions where solar power is insufficient. This resolution sets guidelines for safety, transparency and international consultation.\nNothing in international law prohibits the peaceful use of nuclear power on the Moon. But what matters is how countries deploy it. And the first country to succeed could shape the norms for expectations, behaviors and legal interpretations related to lunar presence and influence.\nWhy being first matters\nThe 1967 Outer Space Treaty, ratified by all major spacefaring nations including the U.S., China and Russia, governs space activity. Its Article IX requires that states act with \u201cdue regard to the corresponding interests of all other States Parties.\u201d\nThat statement means if one country places a nuclear reactor on the Moon, others must navigate around it, legally and physically. In effect, it draws a line on the lunar map. If the reactor anchors a larger, long-term facility, it could quietly shape what countries do and how their moves are interpreted legally, on the Moon and beyond.\nOther articles in the Outer Space Treaty set similar boundaries on behavior, even as they encourage cooperation. They affirm that all countries have the right to freely explore and access the Moon and other celestial bodies, but they explicitly prohibit territorial claims or assertions of sovereignty.\nAt the same time, the treaty acknowledges that countries may establish installations such as bases \u2014 and with that, gain the power to limit access. While visits by other countries are encouraged as a transparency measure, they must be preceded by prior consultations. Effectively, this grants operators a degree of control over who can enter and when.\nBuilding infrastructure is not staking a territorial claim. No one can own the Moon, but one country setting up a reactor could shape where and how others operate \u2013 functionally, if not legally.\nInfrastructure is influence\nBuilding a nuclear reactor establishes a country\u2019s presence in a given area. This idea is especially important for resource-rich areas such as the lunar south pole, where ice found in perpetually shadowed craters could fuel rockets and sustain lunar bases.\nThese sought-after regions are scientifically vital and geopolitically sensitive, as multiple countries want to build bases or conduct research there. Building infrastructure in these areas would cement a country\u2019s ability to access the resources there and potentially exclude others from doing the same.\nCritics may worry about radiation risks. Even if designed for peaceful use and contained properly, reactors introduce new environmental and operational hazards, particularly in a dangerous setting such as space. But the U.N. guidelines do outline rigorous safety protocols, and following them could potentially mitigate these concerns.\nWhy nuclear? Because solar has limits\nThe Moon has little atmosphere and experiences 14-day stretches of darkness. In some shadowed craters, where ice is likely to be found, sunlight never reaches the surface at all. These issues make solar energy unreliable, if not impossible, in some of the most critical regions.\nA small lunar reactor could operate continuously for a decade or more, powering habitats, rovers, 3D printers and life-support systems. Nuclear power could be the linchpin for long-term human activity. And it\u2019s not just about the Moon \u2013 developing this capability is essential for missions to Mars, where solar power is even more constrained.\nA call for governance, not alarm\nThe United States has an opportunity to lead not just in technology but in governance. If it commits to sharing its plans publicly, following Article IX of the Outer Space Treaty and reaffirming a commitment to peaceful use and international participation, it will encourage other countries to do the same.\nThe future of the Moon won\u2019t be determined by who plants the most flags. It will be determined by who builds what, and how. Nuclear power may be essential for that future. Building transparently and in line with international guidelines would allow countries to more safely realize that future.\nA reactor on the Moon isn\u2019t a territorial claim or a declaration of war. But it is infrastructure. And infrastructure will be how countries display power \u2013 of all kinds \u2013 in the next era of space exploration."

Julia Musto reports\nFast-tracking a NASA plan to build a nuclear reactor on the moon may sound dubious. Experts say that\u2019s because it is.\n\u201cThe whole proposal is cock-eyed and runs against the sound management of a space program that is now being starved of money,\u201d national security analyst, nuclear expert and author Joseph Cirincione told The Independent.\nNuclear has been used in space since the 1960s. That\u2019s nothing new. The U.S. launched its first test reactor into orbit in 1965, and the former Soviet Union has sent up dozens more.\nNASA says that a new 100-kilowatt reactor could be used to power a future base at the lunar South Pole, and fuel prospective missions to Mars and beyond. Nuclear would help to fill gaps in solar energy that occur when that side of the moon is in darkness for two weeks.\nThe majority of space experts have said that placing a reactor on the moon is possible, so, why is NASA\u2019s current plan \u201ccock-eyed?\u201d The problem is the proposed timeline.\nInterim NASA Administrator Sean Duffy, who also serves as President Donald Trump\u2019s Secretary of Transportation, pushed to expedite the project, detailed in a memo this week. Duffy said the administration wanted to have a nuclear reactor ready to launch by 2030. Earlier this year, China and Russia announced a plan to build a nuclear reactor for a lunar base by 2035.\n\u201cThe first country to do so could potentially declare a \u2018keep-out\u2019 zone which would significantly inhibit the United States from establishing a planned Artemis presence if not there first,\u201d Duffy said.\nNASA first announced in 2021 that it would put a reactor on the moon \u201cwithin a decade.\u201d In 2024, NASA then said that their target date for delivery a reactor to the Earth-based launchpad was the early 2030s. But, Cirincione says essentially no progress has been made.\n\u201cIt was in the last Trump administration that NASA had put out a press release, they had a YouTube video, they had these announcements about how they\u2019re going to develop these small, modular nuclear reactors for use on the moon, and it was going to be ready by 2026,\u201d said Cirincione, who is vice-chair of the Center for International Policy, a non-profit that advocates for a peaceful approach to foreign policy.\n\u201cOh, really? So, where is it?\u201d\nUltimately, the expert believes a nuclear reactor on the moon could take up to 20 years to become a reality.\nNASA would need a working launch vehicle, a small and adaptable reactor, and the ability to land on the moon. Right now, the SpaceX Starship is the only vehicle option \u2013 but it has exploded during several of its test flights.\nNASA has been working with Boeing on a Space Launch System - the main competitor to Space X\u2019s Starship - but that program would be canceled under the Trump administration\u2019s proposed cuts which slash 24 percent from NASA\u2019s overall budget.\nLanding on the moon is no picnic, and attempts by Japanese space companies in 2023 and 2025 ended in crashes.\nThere are also the scientific and technological advances needed for the nuclear reactors. The reactors must be able to withstand harsh conditions on the moon, including temperatures swings from 250 degrees Fahrenheit during the day to minus 400 degrees at night.\n\u201cSmall modular nuclear reactors, it turns out, are always just around the corner \u2013 a corner you never get to turn,\u201d Cirincione said.\nMany scientists and nuclear energy experts have shared in Cirincione\u2019s skepticism.\nDr. Kathryn Huff, a former nuclear energy official at the U.S. Department of Energy, and professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, wrote in a Bluesky social media post that she\u2019s not \u201cbullish\u201d on \u201cunrealistic timelines.\u201d\n\u201cThe 2030 target does not align well with recent budgetary trends\u2026\u201d she explained in a statement, shared by the university. \u201cAccelerating the FSP program could come at the expense of other critical priorities, including earth science, climate observation and space-based weather forecasting \u2013 all core elements of NASA\u2019s public-serving mission.\u201d\nDr. Alfredo Carpineti, an Italian astrophysicist, wrote in IFLScience this week that the proposal is \u201cunfeasible.\u201d\n\u201cEven if we allow landing the nuclear reactor on December 31, 2030, the timing is really too short for something that must not have any faults if you want to operate it safely,\u201d Carpineti wrote.\nOthers were more optimistic about NASA\u2019s accelerated timeline.\nSebastian Corbisiero, a senior program manager at Idaho National Laboratory who leads the Energy Department\u2019s space reactor program, told The Independent that a nuclear reactor on the moon is \u201cdoable\u201d by 2030.\n\u201cNuclear reactor technology has been around for decades, so its well known,\u201d he said. \u201cSome key differences with a space reactor is that it needs to fit on a rocket, so there are mass and volume requirements; and that the system needs to operate in vacuum \u2013 so components will need to be built to survive that environment.\u201d\nDr. Bhavya Lal, a former associate administrator for technology, policy, and strategy at NASA, and former aerospace executive Roger Myers, recently argued that it would be possible to have nuclear reactor on the moon by 2030, and it would take $3 billion to do so.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible, but it will require serious commitment,\u201d Lal told The Independent.\nBut even if plans are speeded up, Lal says there\u2019s no need to worry about the prospect of the moon blowing up. It\u2019s \u201csimply not grounded in science,\u201d she said.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

  "argos_summary": "NASA plans to launch a 100\u2011kW nuclear reactor to the Moon by 2030 to power future bases, especially at the south pole, as part of a new space race against China and Russia. The project faces technical challenges\u2014vacuum operation, extreme temperature swings, heat rejection\u2014and logistical risks tied to the still\u2011unreliable Starship launch vehicle, while budget cuts and workforce shortages threaten feasibility. Legal frameworks such as the 1992 UN Principles and the 1967 Outer Space Treaty allow peaceful nuclear use but also give the first operator a de facto influence over lunar infrastructure. Experts remain divided, with some arguing the timeline is unrealistic and others noting that small modular reactors exist, but overall the project\u2019s success hinges on sustained funding, reliable launch capability, and transparent governance.",
