      "summary": "Buying a used diesel truck with over 200,000 miles can still be a good deal if the vehicle has been well maintained, has a solid condition, and is priced appropriately. Key factors include reviewing maintenance records, understanding the truck’s past use, inspecting for rust, corrosion, illegal modifications, and checking fluids and the DEF system. A thorough physical inspection and test drive are essential to confirm the truck’s mechanical health. General used‑car advice—such as checking for rust, leaks, frame damage, and proper oil levels—also applies to diesel pickups.",
