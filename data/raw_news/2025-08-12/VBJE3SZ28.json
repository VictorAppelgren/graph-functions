  "description": "K-25, ORNL, and the Y-12 National Security Complex have all played distinct but interconnected roles in supporting the Navy's nuclear program",
  "content": "Oak Ridge has been the location for many firsts. When you mention being from Oak Ridge, you do not even need to add Tennessee. Most people will immediately identify Oak Ridge with the atomic bomb. Many will even know that the uranium-235 for the \"Little Boy\" atomic bomb came from Oak Ridge. However, not many will identify Oak Ridge with the birth of the nuclear navy, the first shipment of isotopes for nuclear medicine, the creation of the first industrial-size nuclear reactor, much less the first use of nuclear energy to produce electricity (a small but early demonstration at the Graphite Reactor).\n\nThis \"Historically Speaking\" series will feature the birth of the nuclear navy. It will bring out the details that resulted in what became one of the most effective nuclear deterrence elements of the nation. This first part of the series will focus on the support given to the U.S. Navy by Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\n\nThe K-25 Gaseous Diffusion Plant, ORNL, and the Y-12 National Security Complex have all played distinct but interconnected roles in supporting the U.S. Navy's nuclear program since the Manhattan Project. Their involvement has primarily revolved around the production of enriched uranium and the development of nuclear technologies, with one significant exception: the USS Seawolf propulsor.\n\nThe United States\u2019 nuclear-powered submarines and aircraft carriers have long been a cornerstone of America\u2019s strategic deterrence. This most powerful military force\u2019s inception can be traced to the unique scientific expertise and visionary leadership that existed in the early years of nuclear development in Oak Ridge. While the thought existed, the practical application was what was needed. Oak Ridge was where practicality prevailed, and that is where the U.S. Navy went to learn how to build a nuclear navy.\n\nThe idea of a nuclear navy began with Philip Abelson's \"Atomic Energy Submarine.\" This groundbreaking physics report detailed how a nuclear reactor could be installed in a submarine to provide both propulsion and electrical power. It was written in March 1946 while Abelson was at the Naval Research Laboratory and was later published by the Carnegie Institution.\n\nIt concluded that, \u201cwith a proper program, an atomic-powered submarine capable of operating at 26 to 30 knots submerged for many years without surfacing or refueling could be operational in about two years.\u201d It also projected that a submarine with twice that submerged speed could be developed in five to 10 years.\n\nThis report was highly influential and was later supported by Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, who, through his relentless leadership, turned the concept into a reality with the USS Nautilus, the world's first nuclear submarine.\n\nThen the first steps were taken when Capt. (later Admiral) Rickover attended a pioneering reactor training program at Clinton Laboratories in Oak Ridge led by Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner. As a result, he profoundly shaped the course of naval history.\n\nRickover and seven others from the U.S. Navy were selected to attend this newly formed program in Oak Ridge. They were here for approximately one full year. Housing would have been provided to them in the city of Oak Ridge.\n\nThat is when Rickover met Alvin Weinberg, and a close relationship soon developed as Rickover continued to pursue the practical steps required to create a nuclear navy. This relationship would continue through the years, keeping Oak Ridge close to and involved in Rickover\u2019s progress.\n\nOne of the first things needed was the design of the nuclear reactor, which Rickover managed through his powerful position on the Atomic Energy Commission's Division of Reactor Development, and as director of the U.S. Navy\u2019s Naval Reactors Branch. The USS Nautilus was the first nuclear submarine, and the USS Seawolf the second.\n\nEach of Oak Ridge\u2019s facilities contributed to the creation and development of the U.S. Navy\u2019s nuclear navy in different but related ways. This relationship with the U.S. Navy and Oak Ridge started in 1946, continues to today and is anticipated for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Clinton Laboratories (which became the Clinton National Laboratory and then the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in March 1948), in addition to providing the initial training, was also instrumental in the very early stages of reactor technology. In 1947, Rickover asked for assistance in the development of the USS Nautilus, the Navy's first nuclear-powered submarine. The concept of the pressurized-water reactor recommended by Alvin Weinberg was critical to the Nautilus's design.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Rickover arranged to have 100 naval officers spend a year in Oak Ridge for intensive study and collaboration with scientists at ORNL. The design of the pressurized water reactor, which became the standard for naval propulsion, and shielding for the protection of personnel on a submarine was all done by scientists at ORNL, as Ted Rockwell, who worked directly for Rickover, told me in an oral history interview.\n\nThe fuel rod cladding using \u201chalf-free\u201d zirconium (zirconium with hafnium reduced, which was done in Building 9211 at Y-12) was chosen because of its low neutron absorption and corrosion resistance. This remains the primary method for fuel rod cladding in nuclear reactors today. On a tour of Y-12, Finis Patton, who managed engineering for the Union Carbide Nuclear Division, told me of his personal experience doing the research that resulted in the purification of zirconium.\n\nOther examples of support provided to the U.S. Navy over the years by ORNL are:\n\u2022 None Contributed to safety modeling and reactor transient analysis, including loss-of-coolant scenarios relevant to compact naval reactor designs;\n\u2022 None Radiation shielding for confined spaces - optimizing protection with minimal weight and volume;\n\u2022 None Studied how radiation exposure affects electronics and human performance in submarine environments;\n\u2022 None Assisted in reactor life-extension studies, refurbishment planning, and decommissioning procedures for aging submarine power plants;\n\u2022 None Provided technical guidance on long-term storage of naval spent nuclear fuel and disposal of activated components;\n\u2022 None Contributed to nuclear propulsion training through simulation tools and data for naval nuclear schools;\n\u2022 None Maintained critical databases of nuclear cross sections and thermal performance; and\n\u2022 None The Acoustic Measurement Facilities Improvement Program combined instrumentation and signal processing engineering to assure the nuclear \"quiet underwater platform,\" i.e., submarine, fleet was operating as discreetly as designed. This was done by the Instrumentation & Controls Division for the Navy in the late 1980s and early '90s. At the time, this project had the largest computer in the Laboratory.\n\nAdditionally, developing and testing materials that can withstand the extreme conditions within nuclear reactors, which is vital for the longevity and safety of naval reactor cores, was done at ORNL. The education of nuclear engineers needed by the Naval Reactors Program was also done there until universities began nuclear engineering programs. Cybersecurity has also been provided to protect the Navy\u2019s digital infrastructure and systems. And finally, specific isotopes needed by the U.S. Navy have been provided.\n\nIn the book \"Critical Connections,\" written by Lee Riedinger, Al Ekkebus, William Bugg, and Ray Smith, Appendix 2, is found: \u201c1957 UT Department of Nuclear Engineering formed as a result of collaborations in reactor R&D.\u201d This was in collaboration with ORNL.\n\nSo, ORNL played an extensive role in the creation of the U.S. Navy\u2019s nuclear navy. Much of what was developed for the Nautilus also applied to other nuclear reactors. The collaboration quickly advanced many aspects of the Nuclear Age. Rickover and Weinberg played significant roles in the establishment of the understanding and implementation of the practical use of nuclear energy.\n\nNext, we will look at the roles played by the K-25 Gaseous Diffusion Plant and Y-12 in the birth of the U.S. Navy\u2019s nuclear navy.\n\nD. Ray Smith is the city of Oak Ridge historian.
