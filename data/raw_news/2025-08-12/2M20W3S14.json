  "description": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 16 Hmong and Laotian immigrants in Detroit, and they now face deportation.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nMore than a dozen migrants from Southeast Asian communities that historically allied with the U.S. during the Vietnam War have been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and now face deportation.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has confirmed that ICE arrested 16 migrants in Detroit on July 30.\n\n\"This operation resulted in the arrest of multiple criminal illegal aliens, including child sex abusers, drug traffickers, a known gang member who obstructed a murder investigation, and other Laotian nationals with extensive criminal histories,\" the department told Newsweek in an emailed statement.\n\nThe detentions come amid ongoing concerns from immigrant rights advocates over aggressive enforcement tactics that expanded under the Trump administration, with ICE ramping up arrests and deportations.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nMembers of the Hmong community, an ethnic group from Southeast Asia, were recruited by the CIA to assist the U.S. against Communist forces during the Vietnam War and a related conflict in Laos.\n\nMany later resettled in the U.S. as refugees after facing persecution in their home country of Laos and went on to live, work and have families in the United States.\n\nOf the 16 migrants ICE arrested in Michigan, 15 were detained after being summoned to their Detroit field office for routine appointments, the Detroit Free Press reported.\n\nThe final man was arrested at his workplace in Lansing, according to Christine Sauve\u0301, a manager at Michigan Immigrant Rights Center.\n\nThe migrants were taken to a detention center in northwestern Michigan, then on to facilities in Louisiana and Texas.\n\nNewsweek previously reported that Pang Nhia Hang Bailey from the Hmong community, a mother of four who had been living in the U.S. for more than four decades, was detained on July 30.\n\nICE officials told the Detroit Free Press that the detainees had criminal records and had been ordered to be removed by immigration judges over the course of years.\n\nThey added that the agency was now taking action because it had obtained travel documents from the government of Laos to send them there.\n\nDeportations to Laos have historically been difficult, but the Trump administration has pressured the country into taking deportees, the outlet reported.\n\nA group of 27 Michigan lawmakers have called for the detainees to be immediately released in a letter to Kevin Raycraft, the field director of ICE's Detroit office.\n\nState Representative Mai Xiong, Michigan's first Hmong American legislator, said in a Facebook video that many of the detainees had never been to Laos, having been born in refugee camps in other countries, or had been brought to the U.S. as children.\n\nMaiyia Xiong, the wife of Wa Kong Lor, one of the detained immigrants, said in a statement read out at a news conference: \"This appeared to be a targeted operation, an easy way for ICE officers to detain people without going to their homes.\"\n\n\"My husband, like many others that day, was taken without warning,\" she said.\n\nSufeng Yang, who arrived in the U.S. as a young child with his mother, is also among the detainees.\n\nAnissa Lee, his daughter, said Yang arrived \"seeking safety and a better life after the war,\" the Detroit Free Press reported.\n\n\"He was raised here. He was educated here, and he built his life here. The United States is all he's ever known. It's his only home. He's not just a resident here. He's a taxpayer, a provider, a father and a caregiver,\" Lee said.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security told Newsweek in a statement: \"Secretary [Kristi] Noem has unleashed ICE to target the worst of the worst\u2014including gang members, murderers, and rapists. Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the U.S.\"\n\nMichigan state Representative Donavan McKinney said at a news conference: \"It's cruel, it's wrong, it's unjust, and it must end. We are calling for their release. Families belong together, not torn apart in secrecy. We also call for transparency and accountability so these horrific events stop happening.\"\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nThe detainees remain in ICE custody, and their attorneys and local lawmakers continue to push for their release.",

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nAttorneys for the Trump administration have denied that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were directed to meet a daily quota for arrests or deportations.\nIn a court filing submitted on Friday, lawyers for the Department of Justice (DOJ) said \"neither ICE leadership nor its field offices have been directed to meet any numerical quota or target for arrests, detentions, removals, field encounters, or any other operational activities that ICE or its components undertake in the course of enforcing federal immigration law.\"\nWhy It Matters\nWhite House officials have previously referenced a daily goal of at least 3,000 arrests. President Donald Trump has ordered his administration to remove millions of migrants without legal status to fulfill his campaign pledge of mass deportations. The Republicans' hard-line immigration policy has raised concerns over racial profiling from immigrant rights advocates.\nWhat To Know\nIn May, Axios reported that Trump aide Stephen Miller and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem were pressuring ICE to increase daily immigration arrests to three times the number recorded at the beginning of Trump's presidency, signaling a shift toward a more aggressive enforcement strategy.\nMiller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and a homeland security adviser, told Fox News host Sean Hannity at the time that the agency was looking to hit 3,000 ICE arrests per day.\nIn the government's filing on Friday, attorneys said claims of a policy mandating 3,000 immigration arrests per day appeared to stem from media reports quoting a White House adviser, who characterized the number as a \"goal\" the administration was \"looking to set\" rather than an official directive or mandate.\n\"That quotation may have been accurate, but no such goal has been set as a matter of policy, and no such directive has been issued to or by DHS or ICE,\" attorneys wrote in court filings.\nThe filing is part of an ongoing lawsuit in Southern California, where immigrant advocacy organizations have accused the Trump administration of carrying out unconstitutional immigration enforcement operations in the Los Angeles area.\nWhen federal judges sought clarification about that number last week, the administration denied the existence of any quota. This denial contradicted claims made in a lawsuit alleging that the high pressure to meet arrest targets led ICE to carry out unlawful raids in Los Angeles.\nDuring the July 28 appeal hearing, Judge Ronald M. Gould pressed Department of Justice attorney Jacob Roth to explain the origin of the reported 3,000 daily arrest target, asking whether it came from ICE, the president or another official, Los Angeles Daily News reported. Roth said he was not aware of any such policy, according to the outlet.\nThere were about 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States as of 2022, according to Pew Research Center. Trump has vowed to deport 1 million people in a year.\nWhat People Are Saying\nWhite House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told Hannity in May: \"We are looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day and President Trump is going to keep pushing to get that number up higher each and every single day so we can get all of the Biden illegals that were flooded into our country for four years out of our country.\"\nA Department of Justice spokesperson told Newsweek: \"The entire Trump Administration is united in fully enforcing our nation's immigration laws, and the DOJ continues to play an important role in vigorously defending the President's deportation agenda in court.\"\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement shared with Newsweek: \"Under Secretary Noem, we are delivering on President Trump's and the American people's mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens to make American safe. Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to target the worst of the worst and carry out the largest deportation operation of criminal aliens in American history.\"\nDepartment of Justice attorney Jacob Roth wrote in a letter to the court: \"Enforcement activity is firmly anchored in binding legal constraints\u2014constitutional, statutory, and regulatory requirements that apply at every stage, from identification to arrest to custody\u2014with multiple layers of supervisory review to ensure compliance with the law. This framework, not anonymous reports in the newspapers, governs ICE's operations.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nA ruling is expected in the coming months as the court weighs the scope of ICE's enforcement authority.\nUpdate 8/4/25, 10:06 a.m. ET: This article was updated with comments from the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security.\nAbout the writer\nBillal Rahman is an immigration reporter based in London, U.K. He specializes in immigration policy and border security.

It has also encouraged individuals without proper documentation to self-deport.\nWhat To Know\nPang Bailey, 53, was born in Laos in 1972 and shortly after was brought to France as a refugee in 1973, her husband Scott Bailey wrote in a GoFundMe set up on her behalf.\nHe noted in the post that she then came to the U.S. as a refugee in 1978. Pang Bailey is of Hmong descent, an ethnic group that played a significant role in assisting the U.S. in the Vietnam War. There are an estimated 360,000 people in the U.S. who identify as Hmong according to 2023 estimates published by the U.S. Census Bureau, and the majority live in California and Minnesota.\nPang Bailey married her husband in 1999 and the couple share four children. According to the GoFundMe page her green card expired in 1995.\nPang Bailey and her husband were involved in a fraud scheme, according to two court cases reviewed by Newsweek. According to a June 1999 court docket, Magistrate Judge Donald Scheer dismissed a case alleging that Bailey and Pang Bailey \"knowingly execute[d] a scheme to defraud and to obtain money and funds under the care and custody of a financial institution by means of false and fraudulent pretenses and representations.\"\nMonths later, in February 2000 Bailey and Pang Bailey were indicted related to bank fraud. According to the court docket reviewed by Newsweek, Pang Bailey entered a plea of guilty in May 2000. It is not clear what her sentencing was.\nPang Bailey was detained on July 30, at what her husband called an \"annual report\" to immigration services. Bailey said that his wife was detained during her meeting with ICE, stating that she was then moved to Port Isabel Service Detention Center in Texas. She currently is held in the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center.\nMichigan state Representative Mai Xiong, Michigan's first Hmong American legislator wrote in an organizing Facebook post that around \"15 Hmong refugees were unexpectedly detained by ICE when they were asked to report to an ICE field office for an 'interview'.\"\nShe noted that many of the detained have never lived in Laos, but were born in refugee camps or quickly left after birth. Bailey noted in the GoFundMe that his wife has \"never lived\" in Laos. It is unclear where she may be deported to.\nThe Trump administration has maintained that it will arrest and deport illegal immigrants.\nWhat People Are Saying\nMichigan state Representative Mai Xiong, Michigan's first Hmong American legislator wrote in a Facebook post: \"These individuals were born in refugee camps in Thailand and came to the U.S. legally as children of Hmong veterans who served alongside America during the Vietnam War/Secret War in Laos. They are fathers, sons, husbands, one is a wife/daughter, loyal employees, taxpayers, and members of our community. Some lack legal representation while others are unable to speak English fluently.\"\nThe Asian Law Caucus said in a July 29 website post: \"Laos does not have a formal repatriation agreement with the U.S. Historically, Laos rarely issued travel documents for deportation. In June, 2025, the U.S. placed a partial travel ban on Laos and cut off visas for certain Lao individuals citing visa overstays and failure to cooperate with U.S. deportation policy.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nXiong is organizing a rally against ICE's recent actions toward Hmong refugees. The rally will take place in Lansing, Michigan outside of the State Capitol on August 8 at 5:30 p.m.\nAbout the writer\nMandy Taheri is a Newsweek reporter based in Brooklyn.

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nYeonsoo Go, the 20-year-old daughter of local Episcopal priest Kyrie Kim, was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents immediately following a routine visa hearing at Federal Plaza Immigration Court on Thursday, according to local news station ABC7 NY.\nNewsweek has reached out to ICE via email on Sunday afternoon for comment.\nWhy It Matters\nPresident Donald Trump has pledged to launch the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history, with immigrants residing in the country both illegally and legally, including those with valid documentation such as green cards and visas, being detained.\nThe administration's deportation plan has seen an intensification of ICE raids across the country as well as reports of people being arrested at immigration appointments.\nWhat To Know\nGo, a South Korean native and Scarsdale High School graduate, immigrated from Seoul with her mother on a religious visa roughly four years ago and was in the process of switching to a student visa. After finishing her freshman year at Purdue University, where she is studying to become a pharmacist, Go was back home in Scarsdale, Westchester County, with her mother for the summer.\nHowever, conflicting accounts exist regarding her immigration status. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Go \"overstayed her visa that expired more than two years ago\" and was placed in expedited removal proceedings following her July 31 arrest.\nGo's lawyer said the 20-year-old was ordered to appear in court on Thursday for a procedural hearing on her visa renewal application, ABC7 NY reported. However, after being given a date in October to return from the judge, she was detained by ICE agents once she left the building.\nA second woman, a 59-year-old named Ketty, a Peruvian asylum seeker, was also detained by federal agents as she left her routine asylum hearing the same day Go was.\nKetty had worked at her family's successful bakery in Peru until \"organized thugs\" threatened them with violence and death if they didn't pay a large sum of money, forcing them to flee the country, according to the New York Daily News. After crossing the border alone and arriving in New York three years ago, Ketty applied for asylum and followed all required procedures.\nThe two women are currently being held at 26 Federal Plaza, a facility that lacks basic amenities such as showers, beds, or hot food. Go has complained to her mother that agents \"barely let her have her glasses\" and hasn't been given a change of clothes, the newspaper reported.\nBoth detentions sparked weekend protests, with approximately 75 faith leaders and advocates gathering outside 26 Federal Plaza on Saturday morning to demand their release.\nWhat People Are Saying\nDHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: \"President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem are committed to restoring integrity to the visa program and ensuring it is not abused to allow aliens a permanent one-way ticket to remain in the U.S.\"\nShe added: \"Those who are in our country illegally have a choice\u2014they can leave the country voluntarily or be arrested and deported. The United States taxpayer is generously offering free flights and a $1,000 to illegal aliens who self-deport using the CBP Home app. If they leave now, they preserve the potential opportunity to come back the legal, right way. The choice is theirs.\"\nEpiscopal Diocese of New York Reverend Matthew Heyd told ABC7 NY: \"Her mother gets regular calls from Yeonsoo and she's staying at 26 Federal Plaza, which, as we know, is not actually a facility that has showers or beds or hot food. And so the detentions here are not only illegal, but they're immoral.\"\nNew York Immigration Coalition President Murad Awawdeh told the New York Daily News: \"They are showing up, following the rules of the letter of the law. And what is this telling people? That if you go to your court hearing, you may not make it out, but if you miss it, you definitely will be deported? This is not a system of justice. This is a system of injustice.\"\nWhat Happens Next?\nImmigration advocates recommend that anyone with upcoming immigration court hearings contact the New York State Office of New Americans hotline, create a family preparedness plan, and work with lawyers to arrange virtual hearings when possible.\nCommunity members continue to rally for both women's release, while their cases proceed through the immigration system.\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nAbout the writer\nAdeola Adeosun is the Newsweek Weekend Night Editor based in Atlanta, Georgia.
