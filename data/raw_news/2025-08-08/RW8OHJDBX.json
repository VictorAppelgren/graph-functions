  "content": "The human researcher only did 1% of the work in this project, with the rest done by the AI agents.\n\nThe AI agents created 92 novel candidates in days; two showed strong binding to strains that evade existing antibody therapies.\n\nLike any busy scientist, Stanford University professor James Zou would like to explore hundreds of research ideas but only has time for two or three. So he thought of a novel approach: Create artificial intelligence (AI) agents modeled after his lab and let them tackle experiments he doesn\u2019t have time to do.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nThe result was the discovery \u2014 in a few days \u2014 of two novel COVID-19 vaccines that are more effective at tackling the latest variants and also does a better job of protecting against the original strain.\n\n\u201cAt the time of this project, there were actually no good, known binders\u201d or molecules that attach to target viruses, Zou said in an interview with PYMNTS. \u201cThis is a very challenging, open-research problem, but also a very important and impactful problem from a public health perspective.\u201d\n\nThe two candidates to treat SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, were culled from 92 candidates put forward by the AI agents. These 92 were narrowed down from trillions of choices and combinations that the AI agents had to sort through and review.\n\nWhat\u2019s novel is that the AI agents used nanobodies instead of antibodies, which are more commonly used by scientists. Nanobodies are tiny, rare cousins of antibodies typically found in animals like camels.\n\n\u201cIf we asked most human researchers to design binders, I think many of them would probably have said, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s try to design antibodies,\u2019\u201d Zou said. \u201cNanobodies are much less common \u2026 so it\u2019s kind of an interesting and maybe perhaps a surprising decision by the virtual lab of AI agents.\u201d\n\nThe agents explained their reasoning: Nanobodies are smaller, easier to model computationally, and potentially more stable. The resulting 92 nanobodies they designed did bind to the latest strains of the coronavirus in physical experiments, whereas existing human-designed antibodies did not.\n\n\u201cThese novel nanobodies created by the virtual lab does show binding, and we also tested them against other COVID strains, and they also show binding,\u201d Zou said. \u201cI\u2019m quite impressed by the output of the results.\u201d\n\nZou, an associate professor of biomedical data science at Stanford, said the virtual lab was greeted with \u201ca lot of excitement and good feedback\u201d from other researchers, who are now using it to tackle problems like looking for biomarkers for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nNotably, the virtual lab is flexible and can applied to tackle challenges in other domains. It is also fully open source, Zou said. That means it can be downloaded, modified and distributed freely as long as it is appropriately accredited. The lab can be accessed on GitHub.\n\nZou\u2019s findings are detailed in a paper published in the journal Nature. Zou, who led the study, has as his co-authors John Pak \u2014 a scientist at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub \u2014 and Kyle Swanson, a Stanford computer science graduate.\n\nThe use of AI is gaining traction in healthcare, in areas such as drug discovery.\n\nIn January, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said he expects to see AI-designed drugs come to clinical trials by the end of the year.\n\nSee also: Healthcare Executives See Rising Risk From Outdated Payment Systems\n\nPowered by GPT-4o from OpenAI, the virtual lab has two lead AI agents: the principal investigator (PI) and the scientific critic (SC). The PI creates other AI agents and manages them. The SC scrutinizes the agents\u2019 solutions and pushes them to improve. A human researcher would oversee the project at a high level.\n\nIn the experiment, the PI created the following agents for its team: an immunologist, a computational biologist and a machine learning specialist. All the agents collaborated in meetings, whether team or individual.\n\nIn a team meeting, the PI agent sets the agenda \u2014 for example, whether to design nanobodies or antibodies. It offers initial thoughts and poses more specific questions to the agents to answer. Each agent contributes to the discussion based on their expertise. The SC points out flaws, asks questions and suggests improvements.\n\nThe lab also ran five parallel meetings with the same agenda to get more robust, overall agent responses, Zou said. The PI agent summarizes the meetings, draws conclusions and makes a decision or decides on next steps. It presents the summary for the human researcher to review.\n\nThere are separate individual meetings as well, when a specific task is at hand that suits one of the agents. That agent gets individual instructions.\n\nAll of this was done in a matter of days.\n\n\u201cIf we want to implement and design these pipelines and create these pipelines ourselves, it could easily take multiple months to do that,\u201d Zou said.\n\nThe human researcher only gave 1% of the work and the rest was done by the agents, according to Zou. Out of 122,462 words written in the project, the human researcher contributed 1,596.\n\nTo minimize hallucinations, the scientific critic would challenge other agents\u2019 conclusions. The team also ran multiple meetings in parallel and synthesized responses for better consensus. \u201cThe consensus is more robust and less prone to hallucinations,\u201d Zou said.\n\nZou views the platform as a collaborative tool \u2014 not a replacement for human scientists.\n\n\u201cCollaboration between AI and human is certainly much more effective than either the human alone or the AI alone,\u201d Zou said. \u201cIn problems like medicine and diseases, there\u2019s actually no shortage of problems to solve.\u201d",

Kennedy Jr. and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Mehmet Oz were expected to host tech executives at a White House event this week, Bloomberg News reported Sunday (July 27), citing sources familiar with the matter.\nAccording to the report, the plan was put together in coordination with the White House, following a May effort by CMS to get public input on barriers to sharing patient data.\n\u201cThis initiative aims to build a smarter, more secure, and more personalized health care system \u2014 one that improves patient outcomes, reduces provider burden, and drives greater value through private-sector innovation and aligned federal leadership,\u201d CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said in a written statement to Bloomberg.\nThe sources did not identify which tech companies had been invited, but said those firms would take a voluntary pledge around interoperability, or how health technology systems connect with each other and share information.\nThe pledges will involve principles involving patient and provider access to health information, and data sharing standards, the report said. Howden said CMS will share more information next week about the timeline for the plan.\nBloomberg noted that both Democratic and Republican administrations have sought to improve data flow throughout the U.S. healthcare system to bolster quality and prevent waste.\nIn other healthcare news, the recent PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cClicks, Care & Copays \u2014 How Each Generation Navigates Digital Healthcare\u201d finds that, despite being digital natives, younger Americans are technologically struggling when it comes to making basic healthcare payments.\n\u201cAnd this, after all, is a generational cohort for whom roughly 1 in 3 reported that their most recent healthcare experience was a virtual or digital one,\u201d PYMNTS wrote earlier this month.\n\u201cBut between opaque pricing, fragmented systems, and clunky user experiences, the financial side of healthcare is often a labyrinth of inefficiency. The result can be frequently missed payments, frustrated patients and untold sums in potentially uncollected revenue.\u201d\nThe research also found that a wave of innovation is transforming the sector\u2019s long-time bottlenecks around revenue cycle management, while impacting the ways patients pay for care and develop financial relationships with their provider networks and systems.\n\u201cFinTech startups and healthcare platforms are turning to embedded finance, particularly payment orchestration, in-app billing, and intelligent reminders; to reimagine how patients pay for care,\u201d the report said."

      "text": "The company announced Tuesday (July 29) that it had raised $243 million in a new funding round. Ambience says the funding will help it expand its artificial intelligence (AI) platform, which helps streamline administrative tasks in the healthcare field.\n\u201cDocumentation has long been a source of friction,\u201d CEO Michael Ng said in a news release. \u201cAmbience is turning it into a source of strength \u2014 transforming how clinicians deliver care, how administrators run operations, and how patients experience the system.\u201d\nAccording to the release, Ambience\u2019s technology helps clinicians by automating documentation with \u201cambient listening,\u201d helping reduce \u201ccognitive burden\u201d and documentation time, giving clinicians more time to focus on best patient care.\nWhile the company did not provide a new valuation, the $1 billion figure was included in a Bloomberg News report on the new round.\nPYMNTS looked at the role AI plays in the healthcare sector earlier this month in a conversation with Autonomize AI CEO Ganesh Padmanabhan.\n\u201cWe are in a unique time in history,\u201d he told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. \u201cUntil large language models specifically came about, it was impossible to distill information out of complex medical clinical documentation and contextualize it for different workflows. Now it\u2019s possible.\u201d\nBut as Webster noted, agentic AI has become the latest talking point no matter its real-world results in crucial areas.\n\u201cIt used to be generative AI, now it\u2019s agentic AI,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is still an emerging technology. Why is now the time for it to be applied in healthcare, given that a lot of the industry is still trying to get its arms around basic automation?\u201d\n\u201cHealthcare is one of those industries with a lot of knowledge work,\u201d Padmanabhan replied. \u201cData is often created by humans for other humans to consume, which makes automation innately harder.\u201d\nAt the core of the problem is a healthcare industry drowning in administrative burdens. The U.S. spends an estimated $1.5 trillion on healthcare administration each year, a cost that leads to delayed care, clinician burnout and poor patient experience.\nMeanwhile, research by PYMNTS Intelligence shows the pitfalls of relying too much on manual solutions in healthcare in an age of automation.\nThe research shows that 67% of executives and decision-makers in healthcare payer organizations say their companies\u2019 manual payment platforms are actively reducing efficiency. And 74% of these professionals said these platforms increased their organizations\u2019 exposure to risks of regulatory fines and penalties."

While large language models (LLMs) have shown an impressive ability to aid researchers across diverse domains, their uses have been largely limited to answering specific scientific questions rather than performing open-ended research6\u201311. Here, we expand the capabilities of LLMs for science by introducing the Virtual Lab, an AI-human research collaboration to perform sophisticated, interdisciplinary science research. The Virtual Lab consists of an LLM principal investigator agent guiding a team of LLM scientist agents through a series of research meetings, with a human researcher providing high-level feedback. We apply the Virtual Lab to design nanobody binders to recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. The Virtual Lab creates a novel computational nanobody design pipeline that incorporates ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta and designs 92 new nanobodies. Experimental validation reveals a range of functional nanobodies with promising binding profiles across SARS-CoV-2 variants. In particular, two new nanobodies exhibit improved binding to the recent JN.1 or KP.3 variants12,13 while maintaining strong binding to the ancestral viral spike protein, suggesting exciting candidates for further investigation.

      "text": "During a fireside chat at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Hassabis said these drugs are being developed at Isomorphic Labs, a for-profit venture created by Google parent firm Alphabet in 2021 that was tasked to reinvent the entire drug discovery process based on first principles and led by AI.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d Hassabis said.\nWhile large language models have taken the spotlight, Hassabis said that the field of AI as it applies to science is \u201ca lot richer than just the language models and things like AlphaFold.\u201d AlphaFold2, for which he and colleague John Jumper won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024, is an AI model that predicts the 3D structure of proteins, solving a half-century biology challenge.\nArdem Patapoutian, a professor of neuroscience at Scripps Research and a 2021 Nobel laureate in Physiology or Medicine who joined Hassabis at the panel, described AlphaFold as \u201cone of the most amazing, quick advancements in science I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d He said 25 years ago, it took a Ph.D. student five years to find out the structure of a protein. With AlphaFold, \u201cjust type in the sequence and it tells you the structure,\u201d he said.\nHassabis said AlphaFold has now predicted the structures of 200 million proteins known to science \u2014 work that would have taken an estimated billion years using traditional methods. The latest version, AlphaFold3, has expanded capabilities to analyze protein interactions with other proteins, ligands and DNA/RNA.\nAI Comes Full Circle\nPatapoutian also highlighted AI\u2019s potential to unlock the mysteries of brain function, particularly in understanding complex neural patterns and their relationship to behavior. He noted that while current technology can predict behavior in simple organisms, understanding more complex brains remains a significant challenge that AI could help solve.\n\u201cOverall, neuroscience is very excited about AI,\u201d Patapoutian said. It could help scientists make headway in understanding the brain because \u201cdespite decades of research, we still really don\u2019t understand how the brain works.\u201d\nEven after looking at the pattern of neurons firing in a brain, it remains difficult to predict what behavior is going to come next. Perhaps for a simple creature like the C. elegans worm that only has 300 neurons, it is possible, Patapoutian said. But for anything more complex, \u201cwe have absolutely no idea, and that has been one of the Holy Grails of neuroscience, not just to predict behavior, but (also) more complex thoughts, intelligence, consciousness.\u201d\nHassabis said in this sense AI has come full circle. The structure of the brain inspired AI\u2019s neural networks, and now AI can help scientists understand how the brain works.\nHassabis said the next frontier for AlphaFold3 is to determine how mutations can cause changes in the structure and function of the protein. AlphaFold2 solved the problem of a static protein, but he pointed out that proteins are not static. Eventually, he sees the advent of personalized medicine, where a drug is optimized for each individual\u2019s own metabolism.\nVirtual Cells and AGI\nLooking ahead, Hassabis outlined his vision for a \u201cvirtual cell\u201d simulation that could revolutionize biological research. Patapoutian said traditionally, the way one finds a protein structure is to pull it out of a cell. But then you don\u2019t know its natural position in the cell. Seeing the cell as a whole and where proteins are located would be more informative, Patapoutian added.\nFor example, being able to view a protein in a cell could let you see that it is, say, localized at the tip of the neuron where specific activity is going on, Patapoutian said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to give you a very different understanding than just levels of expression, for example.\u201d\nPatapoutian also wondered where Hassabis procured the data to train his AI models. Hassabis said beyond the public datasets, there are companies you can hire to generate specialized data to fill in the gaps. His team also uses synthetic data they generate themselves. On the flip side, they could also develop algorithms that need less data to train on. This is to mimic human beings, who can generalize based on a few examples.\nAsked when artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive, Hassabis said people who say it will arrive in months might have an ulterior motive of needing to raise funding. \u201cAI is over-hyped in the near term, but I think it\u2019s still under-appreciated in the medium- to long-term.\u201d He believes AGI could come in five to 10 years, but a couple of major breakthroughs need to arrive first.\nThese breakthroughs are a fully reasoning and planning skillset, and the ability to truly be creative, not just mimic artistic styles or novel ideas it has been trained on, Hassabis said. \u201cCould you come up with general relativity like Einstein did based on the knowledge that he had at the time in the 1900s? I don\u2019t think any of our systems could do anywhere close to that.\u201d"

      "text": "While many sectors have embraced the swift currents of digital innovation, a significant portion of the U.S. healthcare industry remains anchored in outdated payment practices, creating inefficiencies and straining financial health.\nA recent report, \u201cHealthcare Payments Need Modernization to Drive Financial Health,\u201d illuminates how manual payment systems are significantly hindering the efficiency and revenue generation of healthcare providers across the United States. The analysis reveals that despite other industries rapidly adopting digital tools, healthcare\u2019s lag in this area underscores an urgent need for transformation. Digital payments are presented as a pivotal solution, poised to revolutionize the sector by not only improving crucial cash flow and reducing financial risk but also enhancing overall patient satisfaction. While major industry players are increasingly integrating modernized systems, the report points out that significant adoption gaps persist, indicating substantial opportunities for further innovation and growth.\nKey data points from the report include:\n- Sixty-seven percent of executives and decision-makers in healthcare payer organizations report that their firms\u2019 manual payment platforms are reducing efficiency. This highlights a pervasive bottleneck within the industry\u2019s administrative operations.\n- Nearly three-quarters (74%) of these executives also stated that manual payment platforms leave their organizations more exposed to risks of regulatory fines and penalties. This underscores a significant compliance and financial vulnerability tied to outdated systems.\n- The repercussions extend to the consumer experience, with 33% of surveyed U.S. healthcare consumers expressing frustration when modern payment solutions, such as digital wallets or mobile payments, are not offered. Notably, 24% of these consumers would consider switching providers if their preferred payment method was unavailable, emphasizing the crucial link between payment convenience and patient retention.\nBeyond these core findings, the report delves into the broader implications and strategic pathways for modernization. As highlighted by Saurabh Joshi, president of CSG Forte, interviewed for the report, the benefits of digital transformation extend well beyond mere payment speed. He emphasizes that a modernized payment system also offers enhanced security and compliance, better integration with electronic health record systems and improved patient satisfaction. Non-digitized methods, such as cash or paper checks, introduce a cascade of operational complexities, including manual processing errors, delayed reconciliations, and elevated security and fraud risks, all of which ultimately escalate costs and impede cash flow for providers.\nThe industry\u2019s hesitancy to adopt these innovations often stems from perceived risks, upfront costs and the daunting task of system maintenance. However, the report strongly advises healthcare providers to engage trusted payment partners who offer industry-specific solutions. Such partners can navigate the unique complexities of healthcare payments, provide counsel on optimal processes, and ensure systems remain compliant and equipped with the latest technology, even offering backward compatibility with legacy platforms.\nUltimately, the shift to modern payment technologies is presented not merely as an option but as a strategic imperative for sustainable success, enabling providers to future-proof their operations, reduce inefficiencies, and strengthen invaluable patient relationships. Alexander Paull, vice president of Global Merchant Services at American Express, reinforces this perspective, noting that modern payment solutions are pivotal in helping providers improve operational efficiency, reduce risk and align with evolving patient preferences."
