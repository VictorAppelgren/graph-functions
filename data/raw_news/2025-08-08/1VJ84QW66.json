  "description": "The Ford Transit and Mercedes Sprinter are both great choices for a camper van conversion. However, before you decide, here's how they compare.",
  "content": "Van life has exploded in popularity in the last few years. Whether it's full-time travel and living on the road, or just owning a mobile setup for a few weekends of exploration and camping per year, the rolling campsites have a lot of appeal. Lots of vans are smaller and more maneuverable than full-size RVs. They can also be cheaper to buy, less expensive to run (better fuel economy), and easier to maintain. And two of the most popular vans for camper conversions are the Ford Transit and the luxurious-and-capable Mercedes-Benz Sprinter.\n\nBoth the Transit and the Sprinter are available in various configurations that offer a ton of space. They have powertrains that are robust enough to pull heavy camping setups, and both offer the convenience of nationwide dealership networks that can perform maintenance or repairs if necessary. Another benefit that both these vans share, is a vast array of available aftermarket parts and available accessories. Either van can be modified extensively.\n\nOn top of all the special configurations you can get directly from the manufacturer (like the specialized Ford Transit Trail that capitalized on the van life trend), there are seemingly endless ways to customize your van build, with either the Sprinter or the Transit starting as your foundation. How they stack up against each other in terms of space, available powertrains, and what each van offers, might help you decide which is better for your camper conversion.",

      "text": "2023 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter First Drive: A Van For All Seasons\nThe Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a rockstar in the van world, and not just because it wears the three-pointed star on its nose. The Sprinter helped popularize European-style vans in the United States; its influence can be seen in the current Ford Transit and Ram ProMaster\u2014both adapted from European-market models.\nSo while it's not as luxurious as Mercedes' passenger cars, the Sprinter can claim to be just as much of a trendsetter. And if you're an outdoor enthusiast, plumber, or anyone else living #VanLife, you'll want to pay attention to the 2023 Sprinter, which gets a number of significant updates for the new model year.\nWhile it's the same platform that debuted for the 2019 model year, the 2023 Sprinter has a revised engine and transmission lineup and a new all-wheel drive system that maintains some degree of off-road capability, Mercedes claims. Because these days, seemingly every new vehicle needs to have some degree of off-road capability to attract shoppers' attention.\nMore than just luxury cars\nMercedes is primarily known in the U.S. for luxury cars, and it may seem strange to see the automaker's logo on the front of a van. Yet the automaker is well established in the commercial-vehicle sector, building semi trucks, buses, and other vehicles for global markets. Step out of the airport in Berlin or Frankfurt and you'll be greeted by a line of Mercedes E-Class taxis, diesel engines contentedly clattering away.\nThat's because, while commercial users may not care about massaging leather seats, they do care about solid engineering and durability\u2014qualities that transcend luxury snobbery.\nMercedes began importing the Sprinter to the U.S. in 2001, and now builds the vans at its factory near Charleston, South Carolina. Also sold as a Dodge and Freightliner over the years, the Sprinter has become a mainstay of U.S. delivery fleets and a popular choice for RV and camper-van conversions.\nGreater flexibility through more gears\nThe big changes for 2023 are under the skin, and they bring the Sprinter more in line with Mercedes' passenger cars. For example, a nine-speed automatic transmission similar to the one used in models like the C-Class sedan is now standard across the board.\nMercedes claims the nine-speed lowers fuel consumption, and by extension emissions, compared to the seven-speed automatic that was previously standard on most Sprinter grades. That makes sense, as the addition of two extra gear ratios leaves more room for a higher, efficiency-focused top gear, but we don't have any hard numbers because the Sprinter isn't required to undergo EPA fuel-economy testing.\nA greater ratio spread also improves performance, according to Mercedes, which again is a typical benefit of adding more gears. The automaker claims improved off-the-line acceleration thanks to a lower first gear, and our test van did indeed feel quite responsive when pulling away from stops.\nMore power from fewer cylinders\nWhile the number of available gear ratios increases, the number of available cylinders decreases. Much like we've seen in passenger cars generally, Mercedes is dropping the 3.0-liter turbodiesel V6 engine and going for an all-four-cylinder lineup.\nThat leaves a 2.0-liter turbodiesel four-cylinder engine with outputs of 170 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque or 211 hp and 332 lb-ft, compared to the 161 hp and 325 lb-ft of last year's diesel-four and 188 hp and (again) 325 lb-ft for the discontinued V6. The gasoline 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine returns as well, with output unchanged at 188 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque.\nAs those figures might suggest, the name Sprinter is awfully optimistic. That became immediately apparent when we were easily overtaken by a Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross while flooring the accelerator of an all-wheel drive diesel Sprinter cargo van on a stretch of German Autobahn (the kind with speed limits, thankfully).\nSlow but steady\nThe nine-speed automatic ensured that acceleration was consistent, at least, with smooth shifts and no discernible lag in what little thrust there was. Based on the engine note, the diesel four-cylinder seemed to be working a bit harder than the old V6, which could erode some of the claimed efficiency benefits in real-world driving. But it was still remarkable that this big van was being propelled by an engine the size of an economy car's.\nFor a metal box on wheels, the Sprinter also felt relatively refined. The engine produced stereotypical diesel clatter, but without much vibration. With a 600-kilogram (1,322-pound) load in the back\u2014enough to simulate driving with cargo without blunting acceleration\u2014the ride was fairly comfortable. And while the driving position is decidedly van-like\u2014you effectively sit over the steering wheel rather than behind it\u2014the steering was precise enough to inspire confidence while maneuvering through the narrow confines of German towns.\nAll-wheel drive replaces four-wheel drive\nRear-wheel drive remains the default, but for camper-van coveters, the Sprinter can still be configured with four driven wheels. For 2023, the Sprinter gets a more car-like all-wheel drive system in place of the previous part-time four-wheel drive setup.\nThe new system is automatic like the 4MATIC systems used in Mercedes' passenger cars, so it doesn't need to be manually shifted into 4x4 mode like the old system. And where the previous system had a 35/65 percent front/rear torque split, the new system provides an even 50/50 split between the axles, with the ability to shift power between them as needed, or side to side via brake-based torque vectoring. That will make it harder to drift the new Sprinter, but should provide more traction off-road. And because first gear is lower now, you won't miss the old system's low range, Mercedes claims.\nMercedes also noted that ground clearance, approach angle, departure angle, and breakover angle are unchanged with the new all-wheel drive system, so you're in no more danger of beaching this van on an obstacle than you would have been with the previous version.\nAn all-weather van\nWeather nixed any real off-roading, but the all-wheel drive Sprinter handled a bit of mud with aplomb\u2014even on ordinary winter road tires. It should have no problem with dirt roads or unpaved campsites, although we can't speak to its capabilities in true off-roading situations.\nThe biggest benefit of the new all-wheel drive system will likely be in on-road driving anyway. As with all-wheel drive cars and SUVs, this kind of system takes the guesswork out of driving in slippery conditions. The old system required manually shifting into four-wheel drive, leaving the possibility of having inadequate traction if the driver misjudged conditions. That's not a problem here.\nSame Mercedes tech\nThe interior gets some design features to tie it to other Mercedes products, but this is by no means a luxury cabin. The steering wheel\u2014with its gloss black touch controls\u2014and round air vents are recognizable from Mercedes' cars, but instead of leather upholstery and wood trim, everything is rendered in different forms of plastic. It's exactly what you'd expect in a van, but the juxtaposition between Mercedes design elements and commercial-vehicle materials is amusing nonetheless.\nThe Sprinter gets the same Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) infotainment system as other Mercedes models (it was one of the first vehicles to get it, in fact), complete with \"Hey Mercedes\" voice assistant. But a tiny 7.0-inch touchscreen is standard, and even the larger optional 10.25-inch touchscreen seems undersized because of how far the screen is from the driver's line of sight.\nThe driver aids one would expect on a Mercedes (or a Toyota, for that matter) are available, but most are not standard equipment. Automatic emergency braking is standard, but blind spot monitoring, lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control, traffic sign recognition, and a driver attention monitor are restricted to the options list. A 360-degree camera system is available as well, and a digital rearview mirror is new for 2023.\nCompetitive cargo capacity\nMercedes continues to offer cargo and passenger versions, as well as a crew van that provides a bit of space for both passengers and cargo, and a chassis cab that's primed for RV conversions. Typical for a van, Mercedes also offers multiple wheelbase and roof height options as well.\nLike the array of configurations, the exterior styling hasn't changed for 2023. And while it got a bit rounder with its last redesign, the Sprinter retains its familiar tall-and-narrow proportions. All-wheel drive models sit a big higher than their rear-wheel drive counterparts, and positively tower over ordinary pickup trucks and SUVs.\nThe Sprinter boasts up to 533 cubic feet of cargo volume in its most spacious diesel cargo van form, with a payload capacity of 6,812 pounds. Both figures beat the best manufacturer-supplied numbers for the rival Ford Transit. Cargo vans and crew vans with the high-output version of the diesel engine also have a maximum towing capacity of 7,500 pounds, while other versions can tow 5,000 pounds.\n2023 Sprinter pricing\nPricing starts at $45,795 for a base gasoline cargo van, $48,995 for the crew van, and $50,995 for the passenger van. The diesel engine is $3,500 extra on the cargo van, $2,500 more on the crew van, and a $3,910 option on the passenger van. At the time of publication, Mercedes was only letting customers order all-wheel drive with the high-output version of the diesel engine, where it's a $6,400 option.\nIt may be a Mercedes, but the Sprinter is fairly price-competitive with similar large vans. The passenger version slightly undercuts the $51,070 base price of a 2023 Ford Transit passenger van (Ford hasn't published pricing information for other versions), although a base Ram ProMaster cargo van is a bit cheaper than the equivalent Sprinter, at $43,085.\nMost of these vans will likely go to commercial fleets, where managers think more in terms of total cost of ownership than just purchase price, however. That also creates a ready market of used vans for overlanding enthusiasts to convert into four-wheeled homes. Those with more money and less time and carpentry skills can also get pre-built conversions from specialist firms that get vans straight from the dealership, much as Ford will do with its new 2023 Transit Trail.\nBetter, but not a game-changer\nDespite the number of mechanical changes, customers likely won't need to rush out to buy a 2023 Sprinter.\nThe nine-speed automatic transmission gets the most out of the powertrain, and the new all-wheel drive system is a more convenient way to get extra traction. This would be significant in a passenger car, but fleet buyers and overlanding enthusiasts looking at their vans as assets and mobile homes, respectively, probably won't be as focused on the subtle differences in the driving experience that these changes bring. Most will probably just be happy to get an allocation in these supply-constrained times.\nThe real game changer will likely be the all-electric eSprinter, which Mercedes is finally bringing to the United States (in updated form) after several years on sale in Europe. If nothing else, it heralds the future of Mercedes' van lineup, which is slated to go all-electric in at least some markets by 2030. For now though, the internal-combustion Sprinter seems like a nice van to live with. Or in."

      "text": "2023 Ford Transit Trail Is An RV Blank Canvas For Embracing #VanLife\nIf you've spent any time on Instagram, TikTok, or Facebook during the past couple of years, you've probably seen the #VanLife hashtag pop up. RVs aren't new, but the pandemic, people increasingly working from home, and a desire to see more of the great outdoors (and preferably without a mask in the way) has boosted demand massively. While you might automatically think of huge, Class A behemoths, some of the biggest growth in the segment is actually Class B: smaller, more agile, and \u2014 importantly \u2014 far more affordable vans. That's just the market Ford is hoping to corner with its new 2023 Transit Trail.\nAs the name suggests, it's the familiar Transit van but given an out-of-the-factory upgrade to suit RV duty: whether you're building out your van yourself, or turning to a professional upfitter. From the outside, the lifted, ruggedized van looks just about close enough to a regular Transit to be stealthy, not to mention hide mud and dirt with a new palette of relatively subtle colors.\nOn the inside, though, it's Ford's vision of a blank canvas. Rather than banks of shelving for Amazon packages, drawers, and bins for worksite tools, or rows of seats for airport transfers, the Transit Trail leaves its capacious rear empty. What you see here is just one vision of what the end result might look like.\nA blank canvas in three sizes\nFord is offering three configurations of Transit for the Transit Trail package: the 148-inch wheelbase in Medium or High Roof long length, or the High Roof extended length. For context, the van you see here is the Medium long length \u2014 the smallest version \u2014 and, at 5'8, my head was just brushing the roof when I stood up inside. Opt for the High Roof version and you're looking at headroom for a 6'5 person, while the biggest configuration has 487 cubic feet of cargo space to play with.\nAll get privacy glass for the sliding side door and the twin rear doors, plus Ford has marked out drivable areas for things like shelves and cabinetry, a bed, and other key components. A keyless entry pad and built-in inverter are standard, for a 110V/400W outlet and a 12-volt socket, along with a 4G LTE modem with WiFi hotspot support for up to 10 devices.\nAn optional Upfitter Package adds an exterior light bar, high-capacity up fitter switches, a larger center console, and an auxiliary fuse panel. It also includes dual AGM batteries and modifications to the vehicle wiring system. Just don't expect an old-school propane tank: Ford says it's not touching other fuel systems and points out that many upfitters feel the same way these days, automatically opting for electric.\nThe view up-front is familiar to anyone who has spent time in a Transit. SYNC 4 is standard on a 12-inch touchscreen, with navigation an option, and there's an overhead shelf and cloth manual seats that rotate 180 degrees to face the rear. Ford offers leather, 10-way power adjustable seats that don't have that swivel as an option. In all, it's a more comprehensive set of equipment than the Adventure Prep Package available on the 2022 Transit included.\nLet the upfitting begin\nEverything you see inside beyond the front seats here, meanwhile, is aftermarket work. In this case, Vandoit added a diminutive kitchen, fridge, bed, storage, and a lithium-ion battery system. In total, it's around $40-45k worth of upfit, though Ford points out that just how much you'll spend will come down to your desired creature comforts and how much work you're willing to do yourself: anything from a few thousand dollars through to six-figures of four-wheeled luxury.\nDIYers are one of the biggest markets that Ford Pro sees for the Transit Trail, and in fact, that segment helped convince the number-crunchers on the whole project's financial viability. \"They're willing to take the time to build the van to their specifications,\" Julie Ellenberger, Product Marketing Manager at Ford Pro, explains, for whom the idea of the automaker doing the \"must-have, functional stuff; the scary stuff\" so they can concentrate on the personalized elements is particularly appealing.\nSo, Ford adds the bigger, 30.5-inch all-terrain Goodyear Wrangler Workhorse tires \u2014 2.5-inches bigger than the Transit's standard wheels, for a smoother, more planted ride even off-asphalt \u2014 and increases the track by 2.75-inches overall. It also lifts the body, for a total of 3.5-inches of lift overall, and it'll fit the roof vent fan so that new owners don't have to take an angle-grinder to their brand-new van.\nReassurance on the road\nImportantly, it also means the Transit Trail's warranty \u2014 3 year/36,000 miles bumper-to-bumper, and 5 years/60,000 miles for the powertrain, safety restrain system, and roadside assistance \u2014 remains, and the active driver assistance like blind-spot, side-sensing, and reverse warnings is tuned to suit the dimensions and other changes of the van. The new 16-inch black wheels, grille with marker lights, headlamps with LED surrounds, lower bumper, fixed side steps, lip moldings, and splash guards are all unique to Transit Trail, but they're also manufacturer parts.\nThat should make servicing far more straightforward compared to a van pieced together from third-party catalogs, and it's that aftercare story that Ford is particularly counting on to make the Transit Trail a hit. There are over 3,000 Ford dealers around the U.S., over 650 commercial vehicle centers, and more than 800 mobile service vans. While the automaker won't name names, it's blunt that rivals \u2014 which include Mercedes' Sprinter, Ram's ProMaster, and vans from GM \u2014 can't quite match its support network, and nor are they necessarily doing their own chassis modifications in the factory.\nNo electric Transit Trail - yet\nThere's a single drivetrain option, Ford's 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 gas engine with 310 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. It's paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission and permanent all-wheel drive \u2014 no manually selecting 4H or 4L here, as you would in an F-150 \u2014 with Normal, Eco, Mud/Ruts, Tow/Haul, and Slippery drive modes. The Heavy-Duty Trailer Package \u2014 with a 6,500 pound tow rating \u2014 is standard as well, complete with a tow hitch, and you can upgrade the standard 24 gallon gas tank to a 31 gallon version for more time between stops.\nWhat you won't get, for now, is BlueCruise: Ford's hands-free highway assisted driving system isn't available on Transit yet, which is a shame as it would definitely be a boon on long road-trips. Adaptive cruise control with lane-keeping \u2014 though not active lane centering \u2014 is standard, however.\nNor is there an electrified Transit Trail. While a plug-in hybrid would have obvious advantages \u2014 not least a bigger onboard battery that could be used to power cabin equipment \u2014 Ford says it's not under consideration. The automaker is looking at all-electric for the future, but the current eTransit lacks all-wheel drive and towing capacity, and the Transit Trail team isn't convinced by its maximum 126 mile range either.\nLimited supplies but no single customer\nDIY \"vanlife\" enthusiasts won't be the only audience here, of course. Ford says it's already seeing tremendous interest from professional upfitters \u2014 it keeps a database of them for people looking for a local specialist \u2014 and in fact, one company apparently tried to buy up all of the Transit Trail in the first year of production. Ford Pro gently let them down.\nThat's because it wants to make sure there are vans to go around, regardless of whether you want one ready off the upfitter's lot, or if you want to go the DIY route. Volumes will be limited \u2014 Ford won't say just how many it's making \u2014 and it'll be splitting the channel for DIY and upfitter customers. Later, it's expecting to court commercial users, seeing the potential for the van on worksites, at forest services, and similar.\nThe DIY audience is likely to be \"substantial\" Ford predicts, but it's fair to assume that demand will outstrip supply \u2014 even with the 2023 Transit Trail's $65,975 (plus destination) sticker price before modifications. Over time, you'll be able to order directly through RV dealers, but for now, the order books open from today, and the first deliveries are expected from Spring 2023."
