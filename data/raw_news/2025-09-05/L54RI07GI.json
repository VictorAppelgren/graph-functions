  "title": "The iPhone 17 Drops Next Week. Here's Everything We Know",
  "description": "Apple is hosting a Sept. 9 'special' event that's likely to include the iPhone 17 lineup. With 15+ years of covering the iPhone under our belts, here's what we expect to see.",
  "content": "With Apple confirming a \"special\" event at Apple Park on Sept. 9 , the launch of the iPhone 17 series is upon us.\n\nApple executives have reportedly been to this new lineup as the \"most ambitious in the product\u2019s history.\" The biggest rumor so far has been the elimination of the \"Plus\" variant in favor of a \"Slim\" or \"Air\" model. There's also chatter about the Pro Max variant being rebranded as the \"Ultra\" and all four models getting a 120Hz ProMotion display with 24MP front-facing cameras.\n\nIf you didn't upgrade to the iPhone 16 or are just curious to learn what Apple has cooking, here's everything we've heard about the iPhone 17 from reliable sources so far.\n\nOf the four iPhone variants in the most recent iPhone lineups, the Plus model has fared the worst, according to Bloomberg, and Apple plans to replace it with a slimmer iPhone 17 Air. Multiple reports suggest it will have a 6.6-inch display, a single 48MP rear camera, and a minimum of 8GB RAM to support Apple Intelligence ( potentially up to 12GB ).\n\nThe thin model is part of Apple's long-term plans to develop \"the thinnest and lightest products in their categories across the whole tech industry.\" With a thickness of just 6.25 mm , it is expected to overtake the iPhone 6 (6.9mm) as the thinnest iPhone ever. In April, leaker Majin Bu shared images of iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro Max mock-ups, and the difference in thickness is quite significant.\n\nOne drawback of the thin design is that it may leave no space for a speaker at the bottom, so the device may have just one speaker at the top. There's also a durability risk at stake. To avoid a repeat of the iPhone 6 Plus bending issue , Apple reduced the screen size of the 17 Air from 6.9 inches to 6.6, Gurman says. Still, the first looks at the Air, shared by leaker Majin Bu, evoke a fear of bending.\n\nAnother drawback of the 17 Air's thin design is that it leaves less room for a big battery. Per a leak , the battery capacity is a modest 2,800mAh, 20% less than the iPhone 16's 3,561mAh battery. As a result, Apple is hedging its bet and allocating just 10% of its production for it, The Information reports . To make up for the low-capacity battery, Apple might even reintroduce the MagSafe battery pack launched with the iPhone 12 , the report adds.\n\nThe other three models will most likely retain their names, though there's a rumor about 17 Pro Max being rebranded as the \" Ultra .\" It could also receive some upgraded features that differentiates it from the Pro model.  The 17 Pro Max could also get slightly thicker, according to leaker Ice Universe, going from 8.25mm to 8.725mm to make room for a bigger battery.\n\nOverall, this could be Apple\u2019s final iPhone 17 lineup, along with their display sizes:\n\nWe\u2019ll dive deeper into the display rumors below.\n\nWhile the last five generations of iPhones have looked similar, the iPhone 17 lineup will likely undergo big changes\u2014especially at the back.\n\nAll iPhones are expected to receive rectangular camera bumps with rounded corners. The base iPhone 17 could retain the vertical bump from the iPhone 16, but the Air, Pro, and Pro Max variants could get horizontal end-to-end bumps. The bumps could be protrude more than usual, according to an image of phone cases shared by leaker Sonny Dickson.\n\nFor Pro models, this would be a major shift from the squared-off camera bumps they've had since the iPhone 11 Pro . While there were strong rumors about a two-tone design (separate colors for the bump and the rest of the back), Gurman ruled those out, citing a source that revealed \"the camera area will be the same color as the rest of the device.\"\n\nLeaker Sonny Dickson backed that claim recently and shared the full list of possible colors based on camera lens cover parts. All four phones may come in Black and Silver (white-ish). Additionally, the standard iPhone 17 could come in Green, Light Blue, Purple, and Steel Gray, and the iPhone 17 Air could come in Light Blue and Light Gold. The iPhone 17 Pro models, on the other hand, would come in Gray, Dark Blue, and a surprising Orange, alongside the traditional Black and Silver. A sourced confirmed similar developments to Macworld as well.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Apple will continue using titanium for the chassis of the Pro models, though. According to The Information, all iPhone 17 models will use an aluminum frame. But a leaker contradicts this, claiming that the 17 Pro models will continue using titanium.\n\nOn the front, the pill-shaped cutout for the Dynamic Island on the iPhone 17 Air will be slightly smaller than the current iPhone 16 models , according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\n\nEarlier reports indicated that the iPhone 17 Pro Max would get a new \" metalens \" for Face ID that reduces the size of its Dynamic Island . Now, Jeff Pu says the tech might be extended to all four iPhone models.\n\nThe iPhone 17 will come with iOS 26\u2014yes, it won't be called iOS 19. As earlier reports indicated, Apple has rebranded its operating systems to align with the release year (like cars).\n\nThe biggest difference is the UI. A new \" Liquid Glass \" theme will provide translucent backgrounds for menus and a floating magnifier for items you swipe across. This may be a precursor to Apple introducing smart glasses .\n\nA new dedicated Games app puts all gaming-centric features in one place. Apps like Messages and Phone also get spam-blocking features , alongside a few other helpful updates. Plus, a much-needed battery feature that will show how long your iPhone will take to fully charge .\n\nIf you are eager to try the just-announced features, you can install the iOS 26 developer beta on a compatible iPhone right away.\n\nOf the four iPhone models, two are expected to retain their display sizes, and two are expected to change. The Pro and Pro Max models will continue to sport 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays, respectively, according to display analyst Ross Young.\n\nHowever, the base iPhone 17 might increase from 6.1 to 6.3 inches (~6.27), according to analyst Jeff Pu, possibly because of the smaller Dynamic Island and the inclusion of a metalens for Face ID. As for the iPhone 17 Air, while most reports have indicated a 6.6-inch display, Young is sticking to his earlier claim of 6.55 inches.\n\nWhen it comes to display panels, Apple is set to use the same low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) panels on all iPhone 17 models, ETNews reported in October. This means each of the upcoming models could come with 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates and always-on display (AOD) features\u2014something Apple has restricted to the Pro models so far. A Chinese leaker, however, recently disputed those claims, stating that the panels on the base and Air variant are standard 120Hz displays and not the ProMotion ones with adaptive refresh rates.\n\nMeanwhile, according to ETNews, Samsung will manufacture the panels for the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max models, while LG will build the ones for the base and Slim/Air variants.\n\nAccording to MacRumors , Apple is also working on a new anti-reflective, scratch-resistant coating for the 17 Pro models. It's expected to be more scratch-resistant than the current Ceramic Shield and avoid wear and tear for longer periods.\n\nApple could also pivot to the nano-textured glass it has used for iPads and Macs.\n\nApple's iPhones have long had 12MP front-facing cameras, but that's about to change with the introduction of 24MP front shooters on all four iPhone 17 models, says Kuo. These cameras are also rumored to be positioned more centrally within the Dynamic Island rather than in its left corner. Additionally, according to Jon Prosser, all four phones are expected to support dual video recording, meaning you will be able to record videos with both front and back cameras simultaneously.\n\nApple fans have also wanted 5x zoom across the board. That, however, will remain exclusive to the 17 Pro models, according to the South Korean outlet Elec .\n\nComing down to the phones individually, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to feature a single 48MP rear camera. The 17 Pro Max, on the other hand, could become the first iPhone to feature three 48MP cameras : wide, ultra-wide, and Tetraprism. A Tetraprism is \"basically a periscope or a way to bend light multiple times through glass, which is a tool other phone makers have used in their cameras since 2017 to bring faraway subjects closer to your smartphone,\" according to our expert . This would reduce quality loss when compared with regular digital zoom. It's unclear if the same camera setup would be extended to the 17 Pro.\n\nThere's also a rumor about 8K video recording for the iPhone 17 Pro models, but that's something that floated around for the iPhone 16 Pro models as well, with Apple eventually sticking with 4K. Additionally, according to The Information, at least one of the iPhone 17 models will feature a mechanical aperture. This will allow users to adjust the opening of a lens and, thereby, the amount of light entering it manually. Currently, all iPhone models have a fixed aperture.\n\nRecently, MacRumors received three surprising camera tips as well. First, the iPhone 17 Pro\u2019s telephoto lens may support 8x optical zoom. Second, Apple is reportedly working on a new pro-level camera app for both photos and videos, which could either be an upgrade to the existing app or a new standalone app. Finally, the upcoming models might feature an additional Camera Control button at the top that would allow you to quickly access camera and related settings. All three seem too good to be true, but with Apple, you never know.\n\nApple tends to upgrade chipsets every year. Unsurprisingly, the iPhone 17 is expected to get the A19 chip, while the Pro models will receive the A19 Pro chip. A leaker claims that the 17 Air will also receive the A19 Pro, but that wouldn't be as powerful as those on the Pro models.\n\nThe rumor mill is divided on whether these SoCs will be built on TSMC's 2-nanometer chips. The latest update, according to a recent X post by Kuo, is that all iPhone 17 phones will feature TSMC's N3P, 3-nanometer technology.\n\nLeakers are also divided on the memory upgrades. According to a recent 9to5Mac report , however, the base iPhone 17 will continue with 8GB of RAM, while the other three will be bumped to 12GB.\n\nWhen it comes to storage, a leaker named reveals that Apple might drop the 128GB option for the iPhone 17 Pro Max and offer only three variants: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB. The other three phones, on the other hand, may start with the 128GB option.\n\nAll four iPhone 17 models are expected to come with the electrically released adhesive Apple introduced last year . Previously limited to the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, the adhesive would be extended to the Pro models, making repair and replacements easier.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air is also expected to come with a battery below 3,000mAh. Some say it could be 2,800, others claim it would be 2,900. In either case, the phone would hardly last a day , according to reports of internal tests at Apple.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max, on the other hand, is expected to receive a 5,000mAh battery \u2014the biggest ever on an iPhone. For reference, the iPhone 16 Pro Max had a 4,676mAh battery, and it lasted for 22 hours and 5 minutes on a single full charge in our tests .\n\nWith the Qi 2.2 charging standard around the corner, Apple is also expected to support faster charging speeds. The max limit could go from 25W on the 16 Pro Max to 35W on the 17 Pro Max . A Weibo leaker claims the iPhone 17 Pro models could also support reverse wireless charging , meaning these smartphones will be able to charge Apple accessories like AirPods and Apple Watch without a cable.\n\nAfter developing its own A-series and M-series chips, Apple might venture into developing batteries, according to ET News. The report states that Apple is currently running a battery development project and plans to include it in \"products released after 2025.\" For now, the focus is on the modem.\n\nAfter working on a modem chip for quite some time , we finally got a look at Apple's work with the C1 modem in the iPhone 16e . The C1 supports sub-6GHz and 5G spectrum but not the faster mmWave available to the other iPhone 16 models. That limits the 16e's maximum speed potential in areas where mmWave is available.\n\nApple currently uses Broadcom's Wi-Fi 7 technology for the iPhone 16 models. According to Kuo, \"All new 2H25 iPhone 17 models will feature Apple's in-house Wi-Fi chips.\" Only the iPhone 17 Air will have the C1. That should reduce costs and \"enhance connectivity across Apple devices,\" he says .\n\nIn November, Jeff Pu also said Apple would include a Wi-Fi 7 chip in the iPhone 17 Pro in the second half of 2025.\n\nAnother hardware rumor is about the potential inclusion of a vapor chamber. As MacRumors notes , this technology reduces thermal heating by spreading it across a larger surface area. The component has already been used in high-end Android phones, and it could help Apple avoid the heating issues it faced with some Pro models earlier.\n\nWhen it comes to accessories, as mentioned earlier, Apple plans to reintroduce the MagSafe battery pack to make up for the iPhone 17 Air's low-capacity battery. Additionally, following the poor response to its Fine Woven series, Apple is rumored to be working on a new \"Liquid Silicon\" case. As the name suggests, the material is silicone, and according to Majin Bu, it has two holes for a lanyard cable at the bottom. For the iPhone 17 Air, Gurman says Apple's also testing an iPhone 4 -like bumper case that just covers the edges, and not the entire back.\n\nAccording to Majin Bu, Apple's also working on a fancy Crossbody Strap . It looks like an extended lanyard cable but doesn't need the traditional hooks. It's got two magnetic rings on one end that attach to the back of your iPhone case smoothly, the leaker says.\n\nInvites for the Sept. 9 event tip an \"awe dropping\" experience, which Gurman suggests is a \"play on jaw dropping for the thin/light of the phone.\" The orange is a nod to the rumored new iPhone color, while light blue is for the iPhone Air, he says.\n\nAs far as pricing is concerned, while multiple reports suggested that Apple may hike prices this year to offset tariff pressure, a JPMorgan report leaked this week indicates the opposite. As per the report , only the iPhone 17 Pro is expected to get a price hike. That too, only because the Pro model will ditch the 128GB variant and start with 256GB.\n\nIf we were to find common ground between all the pricing rumors we have heard, this is how the lineup shapes up:\n\nMeanwhile, Trump wants Apple to manufacture iPhones in the US , but that would be an expensive and time-consuming undertaking. The president has also threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones if they are made in India instead of the US.\n\nWe'll update this space as more rumors trickle in.",

  "summary": "Apple is set to launch the iPhone 17 series on September 9, with a \"special\" event at Apple Park. The biggest rumor so far has been the elimination of the \"Plus\" variant in favor of a \"Slim\" or \"Air\" model. The slimmer iPhone 17 Air is expected to have a 6.6-inch display, a single 48MP rear camera, and a minimum of 8GB RAM to support Apple Intelligence. However, its thin design may leave no room for a speaker at the bottom, and there is a potential durability risk. The battery capacity is reportedly 20% less than the iPhone 16 and Apple is hedging its bet and allocating just 10% of its production for it. All four models are expected to receive rectangular camera bumps with rounded corners.",
  "shortSummary": "The iPhone 17 series, launching next week, is expected to feature a slimmer model, larger screens, and upgraded features, despite concerns over durability and battery burnout.",

      "text": "Update 7:25 pm: Based on comments from our forums, it appears the original Weibo post may have been mistranslated and \"8K\" actually refers to the high price of the device rather than 8K video recording capabilities. The iPhone 16 Pro currently starts at 7,999 yuan in China.\nOur original article follows below.\nApple's forthcoming iPhone 17 Pro models are capable of shooting 8K video, up from the current maximum 4K capture resolution on the iPhone 16 series, a Chinese leaker has today suggested.\nThe Weibo-based account Fixed Focus Digital on Wednesday said that the iPhone 17 Pro is \"something to look forward to,\" since 8K video will be \"within the user's grasp.\"\nIt turns out the leaker could be onto something.\nLast September, one report claimed that Apple allegedly tested 8K video recording on the iPhone 16 Pro models. However, the capability was never enabled, likely because of hardware limitations in the current triple-lens camera setup.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro features 48-megapixel Fusion and Ultra Wide cameras, while the Telephoto camera is 12 megapixels. Since an 8K image is around 33 megapixels, the Fusion and Ultra Wide cameras are theoretically capable of 8K video recording, but the Telephoto camera is not.\nThe same report suggested that, given the rumored 48-megapixel Telephoto camera coming to the iPhone 17 Pro, 8K video recording might debut on that device instead. Apple's iPhone 17 Pro models are now heavily rumored to feature three 48-megapixel rear cameras, a major improvement over the current 12-megapixel Telephoto lens. That would make all three rear cameras theoretically capable of shooting 8K video for the first time.\nSeveral rival smartphones currently offer 8K video recording capabilities, such as the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Google Pixel 9 Pro (via AI upscaling). Even though 8K video recording isn't widely used by content creators right now, there are still use cases for it. For example, shooting 8K would allow videographers to record using the Ultra Wide camera and then crop in 50% and still achieve 4K resolution.\nNotably, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman in February reported that Apple plans to emphasize the iPhone 17 Pro's improved video recording capabilities when it unveils the device later this year, although he did not reveal any specific new features that may be coming.\nThis is what he said:\nIn past years, Apple has focused more heavily on the camera's photo-taking abilities. This year it will stress improvements to video recording. One of the goals for 2025's iPhone line is to get the vlogging community and other video creators to move away from standalone cameras and use the iPhone for even more of their work. Look for Apple to more heavily than ever tout these video recording capabilities when the new iPhones debut in September.\nIt's quite possible that 8K video recording will be one of the capabilities that Apple will tout when the new lineup launches. Video recording capabilities already added to iPhones over the years include an Action mode for stabilization, Cinematic mode for shallow depth-of-field, and 120 fps 4K Dolby Vision video recording.\nMultiple sources have claimed that the iPhone 17 Pro models will feature a redesigned rear camera system. The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are rumored to adopt a horizontal camera bar reminiscent of Google's Pixel series, and this bar is expected to span the width of the device's back, housing the triangular triple-camera setup on the left, and the flash, microphone, and LiDAR sensor on the right.\nIt is not clear why Apple would use this design, nor what the extra space would be used for, but it has shown up several times now. All four iPhone 17 models are also expected to feature an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera."

      "text": "With Apple paying tariffs on imports from many of the countries where it sources devices and device components, there have been multiple rumors about possible price increases for the iPhone 17 models.\nThe tariff situation has been in flux for most of the year, leading to a lot of uncertainty. We've rounded up the pricing rumors we've heard so far, and provided context on the latest tariff situation.\nPricing Rumors\n- Jeff Pu (GF Securities), August 2025 - Prices are \"likely\" to go up, no specific numbers provided.\n- Instant Digital (Weibo), August 2025 - iPhone 17 Pro to be $50 more expensive, but start with 256GB of storage instead of 128GB.\n- Edison Lee (Jefferies), July 2025 - Prices will go up $50 across the iPhone 17 lineup.\n- WSJ, May 2025 - Apple considering increasing iPhone 17 prices. No specific numbers provided.\n- Reuters, April 2025 - iPhone could cost up to $2,300 with tariffs.\n- CNBC, April 2025 - Apple would need to raise prices by 17 to 18 percent to offset tariffs.\n- Counterpoint Research, April 2025 - Apple would need to raise prices 30 percent to offset tariffs.\nMost speculation about a potential price increase is outdated at this point, or analysts have shied away from providing specific numbers. The most concrete recent rumor we've seen is the July Jefferies prediction suggesting a $50 increase across the lineup.\nReciprocal Tariff Changes and Exemptions\nWhen high reciprocal tariffs were first announced against countries like China, India, Vietnam, and Malaysia in April, there were fears that Apple could be hit with huge fees. Tariffs were pushed back, negotiated, and Apple CEO Tim Cook was at work behind the scenes negotiating, and at this point, Apple is going to be subject to minimal tariffs.\nShortly after the tariffs were announced, the Trump administration exempted a long list of products from being subject to tariffs, and that list included almost all of Apple's devices. The iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and other Apple devices are exempt from reciprocal tariffs, which were the highest tariffs that were put in place.\nThe upcoming 50 percent tariff on imported goods from India is a reciprocal tariff, which Apple does not have to pay at the current time. Apple also does not pay the current 25 percent fee. The high reciprocal tariffs on China are paused again, but Apple wouldn't need to pay that anyway.\nWhen semiconductors and related products were exempted from reciprocal tariffs in April, Trump promised that there was a semiconductor-specific tariff in the works that could be applicable to Apple.\nEarlier this month, Trump claimed there would be a 100 percent tariff on chips and semiconductors imported into the United States, but he said that companies that are building in the United States or that have committed to building in the U.S. will not have to pay those tariffs.\nApple has pledged to spend $600 billion on U.S. manufacturing, and won't have to pay that semiconductor tariff. That tariff isn't in place yet, and the terms are unknown, so it's still just talk at this point.\nWhat Apple's Actually Paying\nWhile Apple is exempt from the reciprocal tariff fees on semiconductors and related devices, it does have to pay other tariffs that are in place. That includes the 20 percent \"Fentanyl Tariff\" on goods imported from China that Trump enacted earlier this year, and tariffs on products that are not exempt.\nDuring Apple's July earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that Apple paid $800 million in tariff related costs in the June quarter, and that it is expecting $1.1 billion in tariff costs in the September quarter. That estimate assumes the current tariff situation remains unchanged and no additional tariffs are added.\nSo Will Prices Go Up?\nIn Q4 2024, iPhone revenue was $46 billion. If we use that number and the $1.1 billion estimate from Apple, tariffs would eat up around 2.4 percent of iPhone revenue. Apple could make that up by increasing costs around $20 per iPhone. Increasing costs of one model by $50 (as rumored for the iPhone 17 Pro) could also help offset the cost without Apple having to raise prices on all devices.\nThe $1.1 billion is not only applicable to the iPhone and applies to all products, so the iPhone-specific impact would be lower.\nOf course, that assumes the tariffs are not changing, and it also doesn't take into account any potential component cost increases. Apple's exemption from some tariffs does not mean that the company's suppliers aren't seeing an effect from tariffs and other related pressures.\nApple hasn't raised the $799 price of the base iPhone model for the last five years, so price increases on some models while keeping the base price intact seems like a possibility.\nApple also has a wild card slot with the iPhone 17 Air, because it's an all-new device and we don't have an existing model to compare it to. Right now, rumors suggest it'll be $899, which is the same starting price as the iPhone 16 Plus.\nNote: Due to the political or social nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our Political News forum.

      "text": "Tim Cook giveth, and Tim Cook taketh away. We\u2019ve long known that while this fall\u2019s iPhone 17 Air is set to be an astonishingly slender and lightweight device, it will come with a painfully small-capacity battery to compensate. And now we have a better idea of exactly how painfully small it will be.\nA leaker and blogger going by the name yeux1122 claims to have uncovered the weight, thickness, and battery capacity of the 17 Air based on what they describe (via Google Translate) as a \u201cmass production confirmed sample.\u201d The first is 5.5mm, which sits at the low end of what we\u2019ve already heard from other sources: previous reports have said \u201caround 6mm,\u201d 6.25mm, and 5.5mm, so this is about as slim as we could have hoped. And the weight is a startlingly low 145g, which would significantly undercut even Samsung\u2019s 163g Galaxy S25 Edge. Wow, frankly. Wow.\nBut the sting in the tale is the battery, which yeux1122 claims has a capacity of just 2,800mAh. If accurate, that would be substantially lower than any model in the 14-, 15-, or 16-series iPhone generations; the lowest last year was the 6.1-inch iPhone 16 at 3,561mAh, so we\u2019re looking at 21% less battery to power a considerably larger (6.65 inches, if the rumors are correct) display.\nThe only iPhones with less than 3,000mAh in recent history were the iPhone 13 mini (2,438mAh) and 3rd-gen SE (2,018mAh), but those batteries had to power screens measuring just 5.4 and 4.7 inches, respectively. You can see battery capacities and screen sizes for all the iPhones since 2021 at the bottom of this article if you want to compare.\nUser experience is more than just numbers on a spec sheet, of course, and it remains to be seen how the 17 Air will hold up in real-world performance. However, earlier reports claimed Apple will be selling a battery case to compensate for the phone\u2019s low battery life, which kind of defeats the purpose of an ultra-thin phone. Rest assured that Macworld will run exhaustive battery tests as soon as we get our hands on one\u2014but it might be worth calibrating your expectations at the lower end.\n- iPhone 17 Air (6.65 inches): 2,800mAh\n- iPhone 16e (6.1 inches): 4,005mAH\n- iPhone 16 (6.1 inches): 3,561mAh\n- iPhone 16 Plus (6.7 inches): 4,674mAh\n- iPhone 16 Pro (6.3 inches): 3,582mAh\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max (6.9 inches): 4,685mAh\n- iPhone 15 (6.1 inches): 3,349mAh\n- iPhone 15 Plus (6.7 inches): 4,383mAh\n- iPhone 15 Pro (6.1 inches): 3,274mAh\n- iPhone 15 Pro Max (6.7 inches): 4,441mAh\n- iPhone 14 (6.1 inches): 3,279mAh\n- iPhone 14 Plus (6.7 inches): 4,323mAh\n- iPhone 14 Pro (6.1 inches): 3,200mAh\n- iPhone 14 Pro Max (6.7 inches): 4,323mAh\n- iPhone SE (3rd gen) (4.7 inches): 2,018mAh\n- iPhone 13 (6.1 inches): 3,240mAh\n- iPhone 13 mini (5.4 inches): 2,438mAh\n- iPhone 13 Pro (6.1 inches): 3,095mAh\n- iPhone 13 Pro Max (6.7 inches): 4,352mAh\niPhone 17 Air specs unconfirmed and sourced from yeux1122; other specs sourced from GSMArena."

      "text": "iPhone 17 Display Sizes: What to Expect\nApple's iPhone 17 lineup will include four iPhones, and two of those are going to get all-new display sizes. There's the iPhone 17 Air, which we've heard about several times, but the standard iPhone 17 is also going to have a different display size.\nWe've heard a bit about the updated size before, but with most rumors focusing on the iPhone 17 Air, it's easy to forget. Display analyst Ross Young today reiterated the screen sizes expected for the entire iPhone 17 lineup, and it serves as a good reminder about what to expect from Apple's lowest-priced flagship.\nThe iPhone 17 will feature a larger 6.27-inch display, which will make it the same size as the current iPhone 16 Pro display. With the 16 Pro and Pro Max, Apple introduced larger displays, while the 16 and 16 Plus stayed the same size as the 15 and 15 Plus.\n- iPhone 17 - 6.27-inch display, up from 6.12 inches.\n- iPhone 17 Air - 6.55 inches.\n- iPhone 17 Pro - 6.27-inch display, identical to iPhone 16 Pro.\n- iPhone 17 Pro Max - 6.86-inch display, no change from iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nApple rounds 6.27 to 6.3 inches and 6.86 to 6.9 inches, so basically, we're going to get an iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro that are 6.3 inches, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max at 6.9 inches. The iPhone 17 Air has a new display size that Apple will likely round to 6.6 inches. It will be slightly smaller than the 6.7-inch display of the iPhone 16 Plus it replaces.\nAside from that new display size, the iPhone 17 is shaping up to be the iPhone with the fewest changes in 2025. The iPhone 17 Pro models and the iPhone 17 Air are rumored to have a new horizontal rear camera bar, but the iPhone 17 camera will look the same as the iPhone 16 camera.\nThere are features to look forward to though, such as the 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate that's rumored to be expanding to the entire iPhone 17 lineup, an improved 24-megapixel selfie camera, and a faster A19 chip.\nPopular Stories\nApple's iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max models will feature a number of significant display, thermal, and battery improvements, according to new late-stage rumors.\nAccording to the Weibo leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" the iPhone 17 Pro models will feature displays with higher brightness, making it more suitable for use in direct sunlight for prolonged periods.

      "text": "So many Amazon customers are returning Apple's \"FineWoven\" iPhone cases that the e-commerce giant now displays a warning message on the case's product listing page.\nThe message, which appears in an orange box with a triangle symbol, states: \"Frequently returned item. Check the product details and customer reviews to learn more about this item.\" Amazon first started using these warnings across the site last year.\nA Threads user noticed the warning on Thursday, which was first reported by 9to5Mac.\nApple's $59 FineWoven iPhone cases launched last year alongside the iPhone 15 as a replacement for leather products in Apple's accessory lineup. The material also appears on Apple Watch bands and MagSafe wallets, neither of which current have the \"frequently returned\" label.\nFollowing their launch, the iPhone cases were criticized as \"categorically terrible\" and \"horrible quality.\" While they do have some positive reviews, there are plenty of negative ones.\nAs of Friday morning, Amazon's official Apple iPhone 15 FineWoven case listing holds a customer review score of 3.6 out of 5 stars, with 117 ratings. While 50% of customer reviews give it 5 stars, 22% give it just one star. Amazon's summary of the reviews states, among other details, that some buyers have had issues with the case getting scratched.\n\"The phone EATS scratches,\" one anonymous Amazon reviewer writes. \"I'm talking you put it in your pocket ONCE and the thing comes out completely scratched.\"\nOther Amazon customers dubbed the case \"total junk,\" \"ugly,\" and \"the biggest waste of money in my life.\" Multiple Amazon reviewers call for Apple to bring back its leather cases, which it discontinued citing sustainability concerns.\nTech writer John Gruber's recent poll on whether Apple's FineWoven iPhone cases hold up over time received over 7,000 votes this week across multiple social media platforms. Overall, 53% of respondents said the FineWoven iPhone case is a \"piece of junk,\" while just 21% said it's \"held up well\" after a few months of use. The rest said it held up just OK.\nLast year, iPhone 15 Pro users complained that the phone's titanium exterior was prone to showing fingerprints that could temporarily change the color of the metal. Apple told users to simply wipe their phones with \"soft, slightly damp, lint-free cloth\" to resolve the issue.\nRegardless of how you feel about Apple's FineWoven material, Amazon wants you to know that these phone cases are being returned a lot, so be sure to do your research before buying a new iPhone case."

In one image, the website showed the iPhone 16 Pro Max reaching a peak charging speed of 37W with Apple's 140W USB-C power adapter, but it is unclear how long the device kept charging at that speed.\nPhoneArena saw similar results with the standard iPhone 16. In its review last year, it said that device reached a peak charging speed of 38W when it was \"under extremely heavy loads such as benchmark testing or playing games.\" The website said the iPhone 16 achieved a sustained charging speed of closer to 20W.\nAll in all, with the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models already reaching peak wired charging speeds in the 35W range, it sounds like there will be no significant improvement to wired charging speeds with any of the iPhone 17 models.\nPu did not reveal wireless MagSafe charging speeds for any iPhone 17 models. iPhone 16 models can charge at up to 25W with MagSafe.\nPopular Stories\nApple's iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max models will feature a number of significant display, thermal, and battery improvements, according to new late-stage rumors.\nAccording to the Weibo leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" the iPhone 17 Pro models will feature displays with higher brightness, making it more suitable for use in direct sunlight for prolonged periods.

      "text": "iPhone 17 Pro Max Said to Be Thicker to Accommodate Larger Battery\nApple has increased the thickness of the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro Max compared to the current generation iPhone 16 Pro Max, claims the Chinese leaker known as Ice Universe.\nApple is said to have increased the depth of the iPhone 17 Pro Max to 8.725mm, up from 8.25mm on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which would be a 0.475mm difference in thickness. The increase \"surely means a larger battery,\" according to the leaker. Apart from depth, the iPhone 17 Pro Max's frame reportedly remains unchanged, and is otherwise identical to the iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nUp until now, we have not heard any rumors about a battery life increase for the iPhone 17 Pro Max or a change in dimensions, so if Ice Universe's information is accurate, this would be a new development.\niPhone 17 Pro models are expected to have a large rectangular camera bump with rounded corners, though Apple apparently plans to stick with a triangular arrangement for the rear camera lenses.\nApple's premium devices are also rumored to have an aluminum frame, whereas the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro models have a titanium frame. The back of the devices will supposedly also have a new \"part-aluminum, part-glass\" design.\nIce Universe also claimed today that the iPhone 17 Pro Max and Apple's all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air share identical dimensions apart from the differing thickness of the devices.\nPopular Stories\nApple's iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max models will feature a number of significant display, thermal, and battery improvements, according to new late-stage rumors.\nAccording to the Weibo leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" the iPhone 17 Pro models will feature displays with higher brightness, making it more suitable for use in direct sunlight for prolonged periods.

      "text": "We\u2019re only a few months away from the official launch of the iPhone 17 lineup, and multiple reports have covered what colors to expect for the new phones. Every year, Apple tries to surprise us with a few new colors for the new generation, and this year will be no different.\nMacworld has received information from independent sources about the colors of the iPhone 17 lineup that corroborate the latest rumors, so we now have a better idea of what they will look like.\nThese are the new iPhone 17 colors\nTo recap, some leakers have already reported on the potential colors for some of the models in the iPhone 17 family. For instance, a leaker known as Majin Bu said that Apple had been experimenting with purple and green versions of the iPhone 17 base model. The leaker also claims that the rumored ultra-thin \u201ciPhone 17 Air\u201d model will be available in a light shade of blue.\nMore recently, reputable leaker Sonny Dickson also revealed the possible two new colors of the 17 Pro models: dark blue and copper. Independent sources who requested anonymity told Macworld that we can indeed expect these new colors for the iPhone 17 lineup. The same source independently verified the Desert Titanium color for the iPhone 16 Pro before last year\u2019s launch.\nFoundry\nWe also obtained access to an internal document with the Pantone colors used as a reference for designing and building the new iPhones.\nWhile the colors are currently the same for both the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, Apple will provide different color options for the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air to distinguish the two models. The iPhone 17 base model is expected to be available in the following colors:\n- Black (same as iPhone 16)\n- White (same as iPhone 16)\n- Steel Gray (Pantone 18-4005-TPG)\n- Green (Pantone 2282 U)\n- Purple (Pantone 530 U)\n- Light Blue (Pantone 658 U)\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 17 Air will be available in four color options:\n- Black (same as iPhone 16)\n- White (brighter/colder than the iPhone 16)\n- Light Blue (Pantone 657 U)\n- Light Gold (Pantone 11-0604 TPG Gardenia)\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that, at least based on Pantone color references, the blue iPhone 17 Air will be slightly lighter than the base iPhone 17. Apple reportedly wants less saturated colors for the iPhone 17 Air to reinforce the lightness of the device, which is expected to weigh around 145 grams and be 5.5 mm thick.\nFoundry\nAccording to our sources, the blue of the iPhone 17 Air will resemble the Sky Blue introduced with the M4 MacBook Air. At the same time, the Gardenia model should look like a lighter version of the current Desert Titanium color option on the iPhone 16 Pro.\nSpeaking of the Pro models, Apple has prepared new colors for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max as well:\n- Black (same as iPhone 16 Pro)\n- White (same as iPhone 16 Pro)\n- Gray (similar to Natural Titanium)\n- Dark Blue (Pantone 19-4025 TPG Mood Indigo)\n- Orange (Pantone 1501243 TCX Papaya)\nThe blue iPhone 17 Pro will likely be very similar to the Blue Titanium color previously offered with the iPhone 15 Pro. The orange, on the other hand, will have a \u201cfluorescent\u201d look, according to our source, which also notes that due to materials and light in the real world, the colors on actual devices may differ slightly from their Pantone-based representations. Apple is reportedly switching from titanium to aluminum with the iPhone 17 Pro, which has clearly affected the shades Apple has chosen.\nFoundry\nApple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 at an event in September with several new features, including an A19 chip, 12GB of RAM for the Pro models, and a larger screen for the standard iPhone 17. Most notably, the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air will replace the iPhone 16 Plus. There\u2019s also expected to be a new design for the rear camera, with a larger array that stretches across the back of the back."

      "text": "Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models could include a reverse wireless charging feature making them capable of delivering power to other Apple devices, according to the Weibo-based leaker Fixed Focus Digital.\nThe Chinese leaker says that Apple has tested reverse wireless charging for the company's new high-end smartphones, but whether the feature is actually enabled when the devices launch next month remains to be seen.\nThis is the second time we've heard about the feature potentially coming to new iPhones this year. In February, Weibo leaker Instant Digital claimed that Apple had been testing 7.5W reverse wireless charging for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, saying it could be used to charge other Apple accessories like AirPods, Apple Watch, or potentially an upcoming MagSafe Battery Pack.\nLong-running rumors of iPhone reverse wireless charging capabilities finally came to fruition in 2021 \u2013 albeit in a limited way \u2013 when Apple released the MagSafe Battery Pack for iPhone 12 and newer models. When attached to an iPhone that was charging via Lightning, the iPhone could deliver power to the MagSafe Battery Pack, which was the first instance of an iPhone being able to route power to an accessory device.\nApple discontinued the MagSafe Battery Pack in September 2023 with the launch of the iPhone 15 lineup, which dropped the Lightning cable in favor of USB-C. iPhone 15 and later models can reverse charge Apple Watch, AirPods, and other smaller devices that support Power Delivery at up to 4.5 watts via the USB-C port, but the wireless reverse charging feature for Apple devices has not been implemented since the discontinuation of the MagSafe Battery Pack.\nIn 2022, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that a relaunched MagSafe Battery Pack would eventually transition to USB-C, but that has yet to happen. Likewise, In September 2023, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman also said he expected USB-C versions of the MagSafe Battery Pack to return \"eventually.\" But he qualified that by saying \"Don't hold your breath.\"\nAll will be revealed when Apple releases its iPhone 17 lineup around mid-September, with an iPhone event rumored to be taking place on Tuesday, September 9. Would you welcome a reverse wireless charging feature? Let us know in the comments."

      "text": "iPhone 17 Pro Might Get Scratch Resistant Anti-Reflective Display After All\nApple has addressed yield issues with the scratch resistant anti-reflective display layer that it wants to use for some iPhone 17 models, and now it looks like the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max might feature the upgraded technology.\nA reliable source that spoke to MacRumors said Apple suppliers have been able to achieve a high enough yield on the anti-reflective glass to support mass production. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will get the new display technology, but it won't be coming to the iPhone 17 or the iPhone 17 Air.\nFor context, we first heard rumors about the anti-reflective display layer in 2024. It's supposedly more scratch resistant than the current Ceramic Shield, so the iPhone 17 models that use it may be able to better hold up to wear and tear.\nEarlier this year, Apple was having problems with scaling the display coating process, and it seemed like the feature was going to be canceled as a result. Adding the anti-reflective layer was too laborious, and it was slowing down production. The process has since been improved, and the new display is once again a possibility.\nCurrent iPhone models have a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating and the Ceramic Shield, but Apple hasn't focused on anti-reflectivity for the iPhone display like it has for iPad and Mac displays.\nSamsung's latest smartphones feature Gorilla Glass Armor, a technology that cuts down on reflections by up to 75 percent and improves contrast in bright lighting conditions. Apple could introduce similar functionality to keep up with the improvements that Samsung has debuted.\nPopular Stories\nApple's iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max models will feature a number of significant display, thermal, and battery improvements, according to new late-stage rumors.\nAccording to the Weibo leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" the iPhone 17 Pro models will feature displays with higher brightness, making it more suitable for use in direct sunlight for prolonged periods.

      "text": "iPhone 17 Rumored to Feature Major Thermal Design Upgrade\nThe iPhone 17 lineup will feature a vapor chamber heatsink to improve thermal performance, according to a new report.\nThe news comes from Chinese tech news site MyDrivers, which claims that the entire iPhone 17 lineup, consisting of the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max, will adopt the improved thermal heat spreader.\nVapor chamber technology is already used in many high-end Android devices. Vapor chambers work by spreading heat evenly across a larger surface area, preventing thermal throttling and maintaining consistent performance, which is particularly beneficial in slim devices.\nWhile the notorious thermal issues of the iPhone 15 Pro were seemingly resolved thanks to the iPhone 16 Pro's new aluminum thermal substructure, graphene sheet, and back glass, the report claims that the device still struggles under intense thermal load. A vapor chamber heatsink would apparently resolve this and allow for better sustained performance.\nLast year, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will also have an exclusive cooling system that combines vapor chamber technology with graphene sheets. Contrary to the latest report, Kuo said that the other new iPhone models launching in 2025 will continue to rely solely on graphene sheets.\nPopular Stories\nApple's iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max models will feature a number of significant display, thermal, and battery improvements, according to new late-stage rumors.\nAccording to the Weibo leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" the iPhone 17 Pro models will feature displays with higher brightness, making it more suitable for use in direct sunlight for prolonged periods.

As the unit price of the 6P lens is 100\u2013120% higher than that of the 5P, it will contribute significantly to Genius\u2019 revenue of more than NT$3 billion and profit in 2H25.\n- Genius\u2019 progress on the iPhone 16 Pro\u2019s periscope lens is on track. It will start shipping by the end of 2Q24 or early 3Q24, contributing significantly to Genius\u2019 revenue of over NT$3 billion and profit in 2H24. Replacement demand for the two iPhone 16 Pro models will benefit from the larger screen, increasing shipments by 5\u201310% compared to the iPhone 15 Pro series. Therefore, even considering the 10\u201315% price reduction of the periscope lens and Largan remaining the main supplier, the high unit price of the iPhone 16 Pro periscope lens can still contribute significantly to Genius\u2019 revenue and profit in 2H24.\n- Genius, as the exclusive supplier, started mass shipments of high-unit-price pancakes for Vision Pro by the end of 2023. It\u2019s estimated to contribute approximately NT$1 billion to Genius\u2019 revenue in 2024. Vision Pro contributes significantly more to Genius\u2019s revenue than most vendors.\n- Genius\u2019 ultra-wide lens profit for the iPhone 16 Pro series (as a major supplier) will continue to grow. The ultra-wide camera of the iPhone 16 Pro series will be upgraded to 48MP/0.7um/(1/2.6\") (vs. iPhone 15 Pro\u2019s 12MP/1.0um/(1/3.6\")). The expected output specification is 12MP, which will significantly improve image quality. The iPhone 16 Pro ultra-wide camera remains the 6P lens design, so the lens unit price increase is limited. However, as the production yield continues to improve, the profit of Genius\u2019s ultra-wide lens will continue to increase.\n- Genius is the supplier of the ultra-wide lens for Huawei\u2019s 1H24 new P70 series. With the P70 series\u2019 ultra-wide camera upgrade and an estimated 100\u2013120% YoY shipment growth (vs. P60 series), Genius can mitigate the impact of the off-season effect."

      "text": "Apple is expected to hold its annual iPhone announcement event during the week of September 8, 2025, with September 9 or 10 emerging as the most likely dates. Like the iPhone 16 series, this year's lineup is expected to include four models \u2013 but with a twist. The Plus device is being replaced with an all-new ultra-thin model, while the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are set to feature new rear camera designs.\nTo bring you up to speed, we've summarized below the biggest iPhone 17 rumors we've covered so far here on MacRumors. For more details, follow the links, or dive into our dedicated device roundups using the tags at the bottom of this article.\n1. All-New iPhone 17 Air\nApple is preparing to shake up the iPhone lineup with an ultra-thin model currently referred to as the iPhone 17 Air. While that name isn't official, what is clear from multiple reports is that it is expected to measure just 5.5mm thick (not including the camera bump), making it the thinnest iPhone Apple has ever made. The device will replace the iPhone 17 Plus in this year's lineup altogether. Apple is positioning this model around its design \u2013 sleek, minimal, and unlike anything else in the range. It won't match the iPhone 17 Pro models in horsepower or cutting-edge features, but its standout look could make it the most talked-about iPhone of 2025.\n2. Display Size Changes\nApple's iPhone 17 lineup will include four iPhones, and two of those are going to have all-new display sizes. The iPhone 17 will feature a larger 6.27-inch display, which will make it the same size as the current iPhone 16 Pro display. The ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air is rumored to have a 6.6-inch display, which means it will be larger than the iPhone 17 but smaller than the iPhone 17 Pro Max.\n3. Rear Camera Layout\nViewed from the rear, the standard iPhone 17 will look a lot like the current iPhone 16, with two vertical rear cameras positioned in a pill-shaped camera bump. However, the iPhone 17 Air and iPhone 17 Pro models are rumored to feature a new rectangular camera bar with rounded corners, with the bar spanning the back of the iPhone, Google Pixel-style. Despite the change, the iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to retain a triangular lens arrangement within the bar.\n4. Faster Displays\nApple intends to expand ProMotion to all iPhone 17 models, allowing the devices to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video. Previously, only \"Pro\" models in Apple's iPhone lineup have had the feature. Notably, ProMotion would also enable the display on the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 \"Air\" to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that can show the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.\n5. Chassis Material Changes\nSince the iPhone X in 2017, all of Apple's highest-end iPhone models have featured either stainless steel or titanium frames. This year, however, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature aluminum frames, with a glass section on the back of the devices to preserve MagSafe and Qi wireless charging support. The base iPhone 17 is also expected to have aluminum, while the all-new iPhone 17 Air is said to be the sole model to feature a titanium chassis.\n6. New Wi-Fi 7 Chip\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are said to be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip for the first time. Wi-Fi 7 support would allow the devices to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously with a supported router, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity.\n7. Rear Camera Enhancements\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models will have a new 48-megapixel Telephoto lens. The upgraded Telephoto will make the premium devices the first iPhones to have a rear camera system composed entirely of 48-megapixel lenses, allowing them to capture even more photographic detail. The new 48MP sensor should also allow for digital cropping to simulate longer focal lengths, offering less quality loss than normal digital zoom. One unconfirmed rumor claims the new Telephoto lens will have 8x optical zoom, up from 5x. The all-new iPhone 17 Air will have a single-lens 48-megapixel rear camera. We are not aware of any changes to base iPhone 17's dual-lens camera system with a Wide camera and an Ultra Wide camera.\n8. Selfie Camera\nAll iPhone models coming in 2025 are rumored to have an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera, which is an improvement over the 12-megapixel front-facing camera in the iPhone 16 models. The camera will notably improve image quality, and allow for more cropping in without a loss of quality. The camera is also said to have a six-element lens, up from a five-element lens, which should also slightly enhance image quality.\n9. Anti-Reflective Display\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to feature a new scratch resistant anti-reflective display layer, but the base iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air models are expected to miss out. Current iPhone models have a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating and a Ceramic Shield, but Apple hasn't focused on anti-reflectivity for the iPhone display like it has for iPad and Mac displays. It's supposedly more scratch resistant than the current Ceramic Shield, so the iPhone 17 models that use it may be able to better hold up to wear and tear.\n10. Increased RAM\nThe iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone 17 Air are expected to include 12GB RAM, an improvement over the 8GB RAM in the current high-end iPhone 16 models. Rumors suggest the standard iPhone 17 will remain at 8GB RAM like its predecessor. Any increase in RAM should result in improved multitasking on the iPhone, as well as provide additional resources for Apple Intelligence features that require large-language models to be resident in memory.\n11. Dynamic Island Changes\nOne rumor suggests Apple's iPhone 17 models will feature a redesigned Dynamic Island user interface, although the rumor lacks specific details. It was initially rumored that the iPhone 17 Pro Max might have a smaller Dynamic Island area compared to earlier iPhone models, but it was later reported that such a change might not be happening until the iPhone 18 Pro models. Another source has claimed that any reduction in the size of the Dynamic Island will come to all iPhone 17 models. If so, it will be the first change since the feature was introduced on the iPhone 14 Pro models in 2022.\n12. Faster Processors\nThe iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air are expected to feature Apple's new A19 chip, while the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will get the A19 Pro chip. Both of those chips are said to be manufactured with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process, known as N3P. Compared to earlier versions of 3nm chips, the N3P chips offer increased performance efficiency and increased transistor density.\n13. Improved Thermal Performance\nThe iPhone 17 lineup will feature a vapor chamber heatsink to improve thermal performance, according to one report. Vapor chamber technology is already used in many high-end Android devices. Vapor chambers work by spreading heat evenly across a larger surface area, preventing thermal throttling and maintaining consistent performance, which is particularly beneficial in slim devices. The report claims that every model in the iPhone 17 series will adopt the improved thermal heat spreader.\n14. New Video Recording Features\nAccording to one rumor, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will allow users to record video with the front and rear cameras simultaneously, which would be useful for content creators. Some apps on the App Store, such as Snapchat, enable this capability, but this leak suggests it will be a built-in Camera app feature. Apple has also allegedly tested 8K video recording for the iPhone 17 Pro models, which would allow videographers to record using the Ultra Wide camera and then crop in 50% and still achieve 4K resolution.\n15. Faster Wireless Charging\nApple's iPhone 17 models are likely to support up to 25W wireless charging using a variety of third-party MagSafe charging accessories, thanks to compatibility with the next-generation Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard. Currently, iPhones featuring MagSafe use Qi 2, the Wireless Power Consortium's (WPC) widely supported second-generation charging standard. With third-party chargers, Qi 2 maxes out at 15W \u2013 although iPhone 16 models do support upgraded 25W MagSafe charging using an official 30W Apple charger. That limitation is likely to change with the iPhone 17 models, which are expected to support Qi 2.2.\n16. New Colors Lineup\nThe base iPhone 17 model is rumored to be coming in six colors, comprised of the existing Black and White colors, and four new ones: Steel Gray, Green, Purple, and Light Blue. The all-new iPhone 17 Air is said to be coming in Black, White, Light Blue, and Light Gold. As for the iPhone 17 Pro models, Black, White (or Liquid Glass?), and Gray are said to be accompanied by new Dark Blue and Orange colors."

      "text": "New details about Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone 17 Air have emerged today. Unsurprisingly, the thinner model will have \u201cworse battery life\u201d than the rest of the iPhone 17 line, but Apple will bring back a discontinued accessory to help with the issue.\nWayne Ma reports for The Information that tests show the iPhone 17 Air will reduced battery life compared to other models due to its thinner design. As a solution for customers who want the thinner iPhone but struggle with battery life, it sounds like Apple will bring back the discontinued Smart Battery Case with a version made for the iPhone 17 Air.\nApple previously made a Smart Battery Case for older iPhone models. However, Apple shifted to selling a one-size-fits-all MagSafe battery pack in recent years. Apple discontinued its MagSafe battery after switching the iPhone from Lightning to USB-C.\nAccording to the report, the iPhone 17 Air battery life drop is around 20%, based on tests that determine if a user needs to recharge the iPhone to last a full day.\nThe percentage of users who can go a single day without recharging the thin phone will be between 60% and 70%. For other models, that metric is between 80% and 90%, one of the people said.\nTo solve this, Apple is developing an optional accessory\u2014a phone case meant for the thin model that also contains a battery pack, according to three people familiar with the matter.\nPerhaps because of this tradeoff, Apple reportedly has conservative estimates for iPhone 17 Air demand. The report says that just 10% of iPhone manufacturing capacity is being reserved for the thinner model due to demand uncertainty. The report claims that iPhone 17 Pro Max will account for 40% of production, iPhone 17 Pro will take 25% of capacity, and the standard iPhone 17 will take the other 25%.\n9to5Mac\u2019s Take\nIt\u2019s hardly a surprise that a thinner iPhone will have less battery life than a thicker version. This would be a major problem if the standard and Pro models didn\u2019t exist. However, having so many iPhone model options in the lineup gives way for an iPhone that trades battery life for aesthetics to exist.\nAs for the return of a Smart Battery Case, that\u2019s something that all iPhone users could appreciate, not just iPhone 17 Air users. My guess is that iPhone 17 Air customers will value the thin look and feel of the device over using a thicker case. Otherwise, just buy a standard iPhone. But we\u2019re fans of the MagSafe battery that Apple discontinued and would love to see it come back.\nEnhance your iPhone experience\nApple AirTag | Add Find My tracking to anything\nBeats USB-A to USB-C Cable | The official CarPlay cable\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "In 2025, Apple is planning to debut a thinner version of the iPhone that will be sold alongside the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max. This iPhone 17 \"Air\" will be about two millimeters thinner than the current iPhone 16 Pro, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is 8.25mm thick, so an iPhone 17 that is 2mm thinner would come in at around 6.25mm. At 6.25mm, the iPhone 17 Air would be Apple's thinnest iPhone to date. The thinnest iPhone we've seen so far was the iPhone 6, which measured in at 6.9mm. iPhones got thicker with the iPhone X and beyond, as Apple increased thickness to provide more space for the battery, camera lenses, Face ID hardware, and more.\nApple will equip the iPhone 17 Air with its own custom-designed 5G modem chip, and that chip is smaller than 5G modem chips from Qualcomm. Gurman says that Apple focused on making the chip more integrated with other Apple-designed components to save space within the iPhone, and that space savings is what allowed it to create the slimmed down iPhone 17 Air without sacrificing battery life, the camera, or the display quality.\nPrior rumors have also suggested that the iPhone 17 Air will be somewhere between 5mm and 6mm thick, and the ~6mm thickness has now been proposed by multiple reliable sources. The iPhone 17 Air is expected to have a display that's around 6.6 inches in size, and it will also feature a single-lens rear camera.\nThe iPhone 17 Air will be one of three devices that are set to get a custom Apple modem chip in 2025, with Apple also bringing the chip to the iPhone SE early in the year and a low-cost iPad.\nAs Apple improves its modem chip design, the saved space could allow for \"new designs\" such as a foldable iPhone. According to Gurman, Apple is continuing to explore foldable iPhone technology. Apple is aiming to phase out Qualcomm modems across a three-year period as Apple introduces increasingly more powerful modem chips.\nEventually, Apple could debut a system-on-a-chip that includes a processor, modem, Wi-Fi chip, and other parts, which would save additional space and allow for tighter integration between hardware components."

      "text": "iPhone 17 and 'iPhone 17 Air' Again Rumored to Feature 120Hz ProMotion Displays\nAll four iPhone 17 models launching next year will be equipped with low-power LTPO displays, according to an industry source cited by South Korea's ETNews this week. While the report does not mention this, the use of LTPO technology suggests that the entire iPhone 17 lineup will feature ProMotion displays with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz.\nProMotion has been limited to the Pro models since it debuted on the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max in 2021, so the feature's expansion to the iPhone 17 and the rumored, tentatively-named \"iPhone 17 Air\" would be notable. Samsung and LG will supply the LTPO displays for all iPhone 17 models, according to the report.\nLTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) is a low-power backplane technology for OLED displays that allows for a variable refresh rate with reduced power consumption, ensuring that ProMotion does not significantly impact battery life.\niPhone displays with ProMotion have smoother-looking scrolling and video content. ProMotion would also allow the iPhone 17 and \"iPhone 17 Air\" displays to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate. iPhone 13 Pro models can ramp down to 10Hz, while iPhone 14 Pro through iPhone 16 Pro models can go as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that shows various Lock Screen elements even when the device is locked. It is unclear if the iPhone 17 and the \"iPhone 17 Air\" would ramp down to 10Hz or 1Hz.\nDisplay Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young previously informed MacRumors that the iPhone 17 and \"iPhone 17 Air\" will likely support ProMotion, and the feature's expansion to the entire iPhone 17 lineup has been rumored multiple times.\nThe standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus still have 60Hz displays.\nApple is expected to announce the iPhone 17 series in September 2025.\nPopular Stories\nApple's iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max models will feature a number of significant display, thermal, and battery improvements, according to new late-stage rumors.\nAccording to the Weibo leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" the iPhone 17 Pro models will feature displays with higher brightness, making it more suitable for use in direct sunlight for prolonged periods.

      "text": "When rumors about the iPhone 17 Air started circulating, it sounded a lot like an Ultra model. But as new details emerged, the Air name made more sense. Recent rumors about a different iPhone model, however, have me thinking we could get an iPhone 17 Ultra this year after all\u2014but in a different way than expected.\nThree rumors indicate the iPhone 17 Pro Max may not be what we expect\nThe more rumors we\u2019ve seen emerge about the iPhone 17 Pro Max, the more I\u2019ve started to think Apple is preparing for an Ultra rebrand.\nMost years, the iPhone Pro and Pro Max models are largely identical apart from screen size. The Pro Max always has a slight battery advantage too, but that\u2019s intrinsic to its size.\nOccasionally, the Pro Max will get a camera feature a year ahead of its smaller Pro sibling, but that\u2019s hit or miss. For example, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max have no feature differences at all.\nBut more rumors keep emerging about the iPhone 17 Pro Max being differentiated from the 17 Pro.\nFor example, the 17 Pro Max has long been predicted to come with a narrowed Dynamic Island. This is due to a special \u201cmetalens\u201d technology which could help shrink the necessary Face ID components.\niPhone 17 Pro Max may also exclusively feature a vapor chamber cooling system plus graphite sheet.\nThese two rumors alone did little to make me think an Ultra rebrand was coming. But the most recent one very much did.\nAccording to leaker Ice Universe, Apple will make its iPhone 17 Pro Max substantially thicker than its predecessor. Per the leak, that means the following dimensions:\n- iPhone 17 Pro Max: 8.725mm\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max: 8.25mm\nThis change is reportedly being made to accommodate a larger battery inside the new model.\nAnd it\u2019s this rumored change that inspired me to consider the likelihood of an iPhone 17 Ultra name change.\niPhone 17 Pro Max could actually be the first iPhone Ultra\nOn the surface, making the iPhone 17 Pro Max thicker\u2014which naturally will make it heavier too\u2014seems especially strange in a year the iPhone 17 Air will launch.\nWhen your Pro line is facing competition from an ultra-thin new iPhone, why would you then make those Pro models even thicker?\nOnly if you want to further differentiate the Pro line.\nExcept per this rumor, the standard 17 Pro will not get these same changes. It\u2019s expected to stay the same size as before, same weight, same battery life, and so on.\nThe 17 Pro Max, however, is leaning hard in the opposite direction.\nIt will be differentiated not only from the 17 Air, but also more than ever from the 17 Pro.\nWhich made me think of the Apple Watch Ultra, and how much it contrasts with the Apple Watch Series 10.\n- Apple Watch Series 10 is significantly thinner than before, has a beautiful large display, and a lot of other features going for it\n- whereas the Apple Watch Ultra is purposely thicker, heavier, more rugged, and boasts significantly better battery life.\nThis playbook looks a lot like what Apple is planning for the new Pro Max model, as compared to the 17 Air and even the 17 Pro.\nIn other words, it sounds a lot like we might be getting the first ever iPhone Ultra this year.\niPhone 17 Ultra would streamline lineup\nIf Apple rebrands its iPhone 17 Pro Max as the iPhone 17 Ultra, we could see the following streamlined lineup this fall:\n- iPhone 17\n- iPhone 17 Air\n- iPhone 17 Pro\n- iPhone 17 Ultra\niPhone 17 would be the standard entry model. It would have the latest features at the lowest price.\niPhone 17 Air would sacrifice extra cameras, power, and battery life for a slimmer, ultra-thin design.\niPhone 17 Pro would boast the more powerful A19 Pro chip, three rear cameras, and other Pro features.\nTop comment by BCGeiger\nAt first I was doubtful but you make a good case. It would more clearly differentiate the various models. The cynic in me also wonders if it would also allow them to increase the price of the Ultra.\nAnd finally the iPhone 17 Ultra would offer by far the best battery life in the lineup, and the best display thanks to a smaller Dynamic Island. It would be a hefty model for users who just want \u201cthe most possible iPhone.\u201d\nTo me, this lineup makes a ton of sense.\nIt also sounds like the most compelling new iPhone lineup in years. The 17 Air will be exciting for a variety of reasons, but so too would the high-end Ultra model. And all of this would make it easy for Apple to raise prices, as I expect it to do.\nDo you think Apple will use the iPhone 17 Ultra name? Why or why not?

      "text": "A Chinese leaker with a mixed track record for accurate predictions has today disputed claims that the regular iPhone 17 and all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air will feature ProMotion displays.\nProMotion has been limited to the Pro models since it debuted on the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max in 2021, but several sources have suggested that Apple will this year fit the 120Hz variable refresh technology into the base iPhone 17 model, as well as the new iPhone 17 Air that replaces the Plus model in the lineup.\nHowever, Weibo-based leaker Fixed Focus Digital's sources apparently tell them that the panel being used in the upcoming non-Pro models is \"just a standard 120Hz screen, not ProMotion with adaptive refresh rate.\" If the claim is true, it would indicate that Apple is still using low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) panels for its lower-end iPhone models, albeit fixed at 120Hz, whereas the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are fitted with 60Hz LTPS panels.\nWithout ProMotion, a fixed 120Hz panel will still feel smooth, particularly during scrolling, animations, and UI transitions. However, it would likely drain more battery, since it's refreshing rapidly all the time, even when viewing static content. In contrast, ProMotion dynamically adjusts the refresh rate anywhere between 1Hz and 120Hz, depending on content and user interaction, which preserves battery life.\nA fixed 120Hz panel also means the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air would lack Apple's always-on display capability that shows the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked and idle.\nFortunately, the case for ProMotion coming to the non-Pro iPhone 17 remains strong. Display Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young last year indicated that Apple's suppliers are ramping up production of LTPO panels for the entire iPhone 17 lineup, further supporting the possibility of ProMotion displays across all models. LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) is a low-power backplane technology for OLED displays that allows for a variable refresh rate with reduced power consumption. Young's claim has since been corroborated by South Korea's ETNews and The Elec.\nFixed Focus Digital has shared accurate predictions in the past, including correctly naming the iPhone 16E before its official confirmation. The account also accurately claimed the iPhone 16 Pro models would be available in a new bronze finish, which ended up being Desert Titanium. On the other hand, the account was wrong about the number of iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus color options that would be available. As for ProMotion, the weight of evidence is against them on this rumor, and we're personally hoping it's a bad call. Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 lineup around September."

      "text": "'iPhone 17 Slim' Said to Feature 6.55-Inch Display\nApple's iPhone 17 Plus or \"iPhone 17 Slim\" will feature a 6.55-inch display, according to Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) analyst Ross Young.\nIn a post to subscribers on X (formerly Twitter), Young added to a report first shared yesterday by Haitong International Securities Jeff Pu. Pu claimed that the iPhone 17 Plus, rumored to launch in 2025, could be replaced by an \"iPhone 17 Slim.\"\nPu said that the iPhone 17 Slim will feature a 6.6-inch display, which is a slight reduction on the iPhone 14, 15, and 16 Plus, which feature a 6.69-inch OLED display.

      "text": "Apple Intelligence has raised the bar when it comes to RAM requirements as AI-based features require a device with at least 8GB of RAM. With Apple working to expand the capabilities of Apple Intelligence even further, the company is now rumored to put 12GB of RAM in the iPhone 17 Pro models.\niPhone 17 Pro expected to feature 12GB RAM\nRumors about some of this year\u2019s iPhone models having 12GB of RAM are not new. In fact, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted the RAM increase for the 17 Pro lineup in August last year after Apple announced Apple Intelligence at WWDC 2024. However, it\u2019s now becoming clearer that this year\u2019s iPhones will get another RAM upgrade.\nIn a note to investors seen by 9to5Mac, analyst Jeff Pu of GFHK Tech Research corroborates the rumors about the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max having 12GB of RAM, compared to 8GB in the current models. According to the analyst, the increased demand for AI capabilities has pushed PC and smartphone manufacturers to upgrade the RAM in their devices.\n\u201cMeanwhile iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are expected to migrate to LPDDR5 12GB, this transition alone will contribute to a 3.5% YoYincrease in smartphone DRAM content across an estimated 100 million new iPhone units,\u201d the analist said.\nIn 2023, only the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max were equipped with 8GB of RAM, while the non-Pro models only have 6GB of RAM. Last year, Apple put 8GB of RAM in the base iPhone 16 and 16 Plus models. As a result, Apple Intelligence is only available for iPhone 15 Pro and later. The recently announced iPhone 16e also has 8GB RAM and support for Apple Intelligence.\nWhile the RAM increase will certainly make the iPhone 17 Pro more future-proof, it also hints at new Apple Intelligence features that may require even more RAM, and consequently will only be available on these iPhone models. For instance, Apple last year updated its entire Mac lineup \u2013 including the old M2 MacBook Air \u2013 with 16GB of RAM.\nLatest rumors on the new iPhones\nBased on recent rumors, the entire iPhone 17 lineup will come with major design changes. The devices are expected to feature a new camera layout and video features that will make them more appealing for vlogging. Apple is also rumored to introduce a new ultra-slim iPhone that will sit between the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro, possibly replacing the current Plus model.\nThe new iPhones are likely to be announced in September.\n- Best deals on Apple products\n- This realistic concept shows what the iPhone 17 Air might look like in real life\n- iPhone 16e pricing hints at unpopular changes ahead for iPhone 17\n- iPhone 17 Air and iPhone 17 Pro design leaks are too strange to ignore\n- Wireless reverse charging being tested in the iPhone 17 Pro \u2013 leaker\n- Render claims to show iPhone 17 Pro design, in silver and Space Black\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "Apple has begun selling its first portable MagSafe battery chargers over the company\u2019s website.\nThe product, simply dubbed the \u201cMagSafe Battery Pack,\u201d retails for $99. And it can wirelessly recharge your iPhone 12 or 12 Pro on the go through the magnetically-attachable MagSafe connector.\nThe accessory looks similar in size to an AirPods case, making it compact enough to fit in a pocket, even while attached to an iPhone.\nThanks to the built-in magnets, the device will also remain attached to the iPhone while the charging occurs. \u201cAnd it automatically charges, so there\u2019s no need to turn it on or off,\u201d Apple says.\nThe recharging also won\u2019t interfere with your credit cards or key fobs, although Apple notes: \u201cIf you use any other (iPhone) case that holds items like credit cards, remove them before charging with your MagSafe Battery Pack.\u201d\nThe device can also double as a standard cable-based MagSafe charger. This can be done when the battery pack is connected to a power source via a Lightning cable.\n\u201cWhen charging on the go, your MagSafe Battery Pack can charge your iPhone with up to 5W of power. If connected to a 20W or higher power source, it can charge with up to 15W of power,\u201d the Apple support document for the product says.\nIn addition, attaching the MagSafe Battery Pack to an iPhone and then plugging in the MagSafe Battery Pack into a power adapter will recharge both devices simultaneously. \u201cYou can also charge both if you attach your MagSafe Battery Pack to your iPhone, then plug your iPhone into a power source,\u201d Apple adds.\nTo use the battery charger, the company says an iPhone should be running iOS 14.7 or higher. The charging status will appear on the Lock screen once the battery pack is attached. Apple also notes the software may slow down the recharging process to prevent overheating.\n\u201cTo extend the lifespan of your battery, if the battery gets too warm, software might limit charging above 80%. Your iPhone will charge again when the temperature drops,\u201d the company said.\nAccording to Apple\u2019s website, the company will ship out the battery packs within three to five business days after an order is made."

      "text": "iPhone 17 Pro Max Battery Capacity Leaked\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature the biggest ever battery in an iPhone, according to the Weibo leaker known as \"Instant Digital.\"\nIn a new post, the leaker listed the battery capacities of the iPhone 11 Pro Max through to the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and added that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature a battery capacity of 5,000mAh:\n- iPhone 11 Pro Max: 3,969mAh\n- iPhone 12 Pro Max: 3,687mAh\n- iPhone 13 Pro Max: 4,352mAh\n- iPhone 14 Pro Max: 4,323mAh\n- iPhone 15 Pro Max: 4,422mAh\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max: 4,676mAh\n- iPhone 17 Pro Max: ~5,000mAh\nThe battery life of the iPhone 16 Pro Max is 33 hours, according to Apple. This is up from 29 hours on the iPhone 14 Pro Max, and 28 hours on the iPhone 13 Pro Max. The iPhone 12 Pro Max had a battery life of just 20 hours. With an extra 300mAh of battery capacity, the iPhone 17 Pro Max could be on course to offer around 35 hours of battery life, or perhaps even more. Efficiency improvements from the A19 Pro chip and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X80 modem should also contribute significantly to enhanced battery life.\nInstant Digital has a mixed track record for Apple rumors, but has provided some strikingly accurate information, such as the imminent launch of 2023's Yellow iPhone 14, the frosted back glass of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, the Apple Watch Series 9 as a minor refresh, spatial video capture on the iPhone 15 Pro, the latest iPad Air and iPad Pro's landscape front-facing camera, the M4 iPad Pro's nano-texture display option, the iPhone 16 Pro's battery capacities, and continued Apple Watch band compatibility through the Apple Watch Series 10.

Crystal-Optech, the primary supplier of prisms, is one of the leading beneficiaries in this supply chain. Additionally, many investors worry that Apple may replace glass prisms with plastic ones. However, my latest supply chain survey indicates that iPhones will continue to use glass prisms for the next few years.\n1. iPhone 16 (2H24):\n(1) The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max will feature a tetraprism camera (with the same specifications as the iPhone 15 Pro Max).\n(2) Tetraprism camera penetration will increase from 35\u201340% in iPhone 15 series to 60\u201365% in iPhone 16 series, resulting in significant YoY growth of approximately 160% in tetraprism camera shipments in 2024.\n(3) In addition to the shipment growth, Crystal-Optech\u2019s revenue and profit will benefit from the increase in supply share from 70\u201375% in 2023 to over 80% in 2024. Another key factor is the significant reduction in capex and R&D expenses in 2024, which will also favor profit growth.\n2. iPhone 17 (2H25) & iPhone 18 (2H26):\n(1) The high-end iPhone 17 model is expected to feature an upgraded tetraprism camera, with key specification changes from a 1/3.1\" 12MP CIS in the iPhone 16 Pro series to a 1/2.6\" 48MP CIS. This upgrade will enhance photo quality and zoom functionality.\n(2) It is currently uncertain whether only the iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature the upgraded tetraprism camera. If so, the 2H26 iPhone 18 Pro will also feature the upgraded tetraprism camera.\n(3) The upgraded tetraprism camera requires all-new designed prisms. The prism must have a shorter form factor to reduce the camera\u2019s height. Considering the new design and the continuous improvement of production yields, Crystal-Optech\u2019s revenue and profits are expected to grow in 2025 and 2026.\n3. iPhone 19 (2H27):\n(1) The tetraprism camera will undergo another significant specification upgrade in the new iPhone models of 2027, with a more substantial improvement than those in the iPhone 17 and iPhone 18. The 2H27 new iPhone is expected to support a better optical zoom.\n(2) There are several ways to increase the optical zoom. One of the most feasible solutions is to increase the number of prisms to lengthen the light path (in which case, it would no longer be called a tetraprism). As the number of prisms increases, the prism size may need to be reduced, increasing the complexity of the prism design. All of the above are beneficial to Crystal-Optech\u2019s business momentum."

      "text": "The iPhone SE 4 that's set to come out early next year is expected to debut Apple's first in-house 5G modem, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain.\nIn a research note this week with Hong Kong-based investment firm Haitong International Securities, Pu said Apple is expected to roll out its custom-made 5G modem starting with the next-generation iPhone SE 4. Apple's in-house modem will then be joined by a secondary Apple-made Wi-Fi 7 chip in the iPhone 17 Pro in the second half of 2025.\nPu has previously said that iPhone 17 Pro models in 2025 will be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, which matches his latest expectations for adoption. Pu believes that both custom modem and Wi-Fi 7 chips will achieve majority adoption in iPhones by 2027.\nPu's forecast also tallies with predictions recently made by Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. On Thursday, Kuo said that at least one iPhone 17 model launching next year will be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip. Kuo also expects Apple's 5G modem to be used in the rumored ultra-thin iPhone 17 model.\nKuo believes that Apple's 5G and Wi-Fi chips are currently two different chips that will gradually be used in new products simultaneously starting in the second half of 2025. The early switch-over timelines will differ due to separate production schedules, according to Kuo. As Pu also suggests, the iPhone SE 4 will move to an Apple 5G modem but still use a Broadcom Wi-Fi chip.\nApple's shift to develop its own modem and Wi-Fi chip technology would be a significant strategic move. Currently, Apple relies on Qualcomm to supply its modems, and Broadcom for its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth components. For example, all four iPhone 16 models already support Wi-Fi 7 with Broadcom's chip, but with some limited specifications. By creating its own equivalents, Apple aims to reduce dependency on third-parties, gain more control over the technology, and potentially lower costs in the long run.\nThe fourth-generation iPhone SE is expected to have a similar design as the base iPhone 14, with rumored features including a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, a newer A-series chip, a USB-C port, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, 8GB of RAM to enable Apple Intelligence support, and of course the first-ever Apple-designed 5G modem. The new iPhone SE is expected to be released in the first half of 2025, with a launch in March or April most likely."

      "text": "Kuo: iPhone 17 to Feature 24MP Front-Facing Camera\nThe iPhone 17 lineup will feature a 24-megapixel front-facing camera, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\nThe information was shared in a new post on Medium. The iPhone 14 and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements. The iPhone 16 lineup is expected to feature the same hardware. With the iPhone 17, Apple will apparently bolster the hardware to a 24-megapixel camera with a six-element lens. Kuo says that the upgrade will significantly improve the image quality of the front-facing camera.\n- iPhone 6S: 5-megapixel front-facing camera with \u0192/2.2 aperture and 4P lens\n- iPhone 7, iPhone X, and iPhone XS: 7-megapixel front-facing camera with \u0192/2.2 aperture and 4P lens\n- iPhone 11, iPhone 12, and iPhone 13: 12-megapixel front-facing camera with \u0192/2.2 aperture and 5P lens\n- iPhone 14, iPhone 15, and iPhone 16: 12-megapixel front-facing camera with \u0192/1.9 aperture, autofocus, and 5P lens\n- iPhone 17: 24-megapixel front-facing camera with autofocus and 6P lens\nThe upgraded resolution to 24 megapixels is noteworthy because it would allow for greater detail and clarity in images. With a higher resolution, photos can maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, providing more flexibility in post-processing. Additionally, the larger number of pixels can capture finer details, making the images sharper and more vibrant.\nThe upgrade to a six-element lens would also slightly enhance image quality. Each element can be designed to correct for various aberrations and distortions, leading to clearer, more accurate photos. The additional elements can also improve the efficiency of light transmission to the sensor, enhancing low-light performance.\nIt is worth noting that the iPhone 17 Pro is expected to be the first iPhone to feature under-panel Face ID technology, which could reduce the size of the Dynamic Island, but a circular cutout for the front-facing camera is expected to remain. The iPhone 17 Pro will probably be Apple's last premium model to include a circular cutout for the front-facing camera. Apple is then expected adopt under-display cameras in 2027's \"Pro\" iPhone models for a true \"all-screen\" appearance.\nPopular Stories\nApple's iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max models will feature a number of significant display, thermal, and battery improvements, according to new late-stage rumors.\nAccording to the Weibo leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" the iPhone 17 Pro models will feature displays with higher brightness, making it more suitable for use in direct sunlight for prolonged periods.

This reiterates information that he first shared in May.\nIn a research note with investment bank Haitong International earlier this month, obtained by MacRumors, Pu said the iPhone 17 Pro Max will adopt a \"metalens\" for Face ID that results in a \"much narrowed\" Dynamic Island on the device. He does not expect this change to apply to the smaller iPhone 17 Pro, or any other iPhone 17 models.\nWhile a traditional iPhone camera has curved lenses that redirect light towards the image sensor, a metalens is a thin and flat lens with microscopic patterns etched onto it that can focus light more precisely.

      "text": "A new research note from Jeff Pu of Haitong International Securities predicts some changes for the iPhone lineup of 2025. The contents of the note were first reported by 9to5Mac.\nAccording to Pu, the larger non-Pro iPhone 17 will be referred to as a \u201cslim\u201d model, though we don\u2019t know how much thinner it will be than the current iPhone 15 Plus and expected iPhone 16 Plus. According to Pu, the iPhone 17 lineup and its screen sizes will be as follows:\n- iPhone 17: 6.1-inch display\n- iPhone 17 Slim: 6.6-inch display\n- iPhone 17 Pro: 6.3-inch display\n- iPhone 17 Pro Max: 6.9-inch display\nAll but the iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature aluminum designs that are said to be more complex, while the iPhone 17 Pro Max will be the lone titanium phone in the lineup.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max will also be the only model to use \u201cmetalens\u201d technology to dramatically reduce the size of the proximity sensor which will allow for a narrower dynamic island. A metalens is a microscopic flat structure with an array of microscopic waveguide pillars made of titanium dioxide. The waveguides focus light much like a traditional lens but at a tiny fraction of the size.\nIn addition, Pu claims that the iPhone 17 and 17 Slim will feature 8GB of RAM with either the A18 or A19 chip, while the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will jump up to the A19 Pro with 12GB of RAM. All models are expected to include a 24MP front-facing camera. Previous rumors have suggested that all iPhone 17 models will get always-on displays as well.\nPu has been accurate in some past predictions and less accurate in others, but it\u2019s worth noting that the iPhone 17 lineup\u2019s exact design and features are probably not written in stone yet even within Apple, so there\u2019s plenty of time for things to change.\nBefore the iPhone 17 arrives, we\u2019re expecting the iPhone 16 and iPhone SE 4 to launch. iPhone 16 will arrive at a September launch event \u2013 find out how to watch the Apple September event live stream. For iPhone SE 4 and other new Apple products, see when is the next Apple event.

Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming with the new iPhone 17 lineup based on the latest rumors.\niPhone 17\nLast year, the iPhone 16 was one of the most compelling base models yet. iPhone 17 may not have as packed a list of new features as what\u2019s coming to other models, but it appears ready to continue that trend nonetheless.\n- 6.3-inch screen: Slightly larger display, similar to iPhone 16 Pro size.\n- A19 chip: New chip with incremental improvements over last year.\n- 24MP front-facing TrueDepth camera: The first selfie camera upgrade in years.\n- ProMotion and always-on display: Formerly Pro-exclusive dynamic refresh rate features.\n- Refreshed color lineup: Purple, Green, Blue, Black, and White.\n- $799 price expected: The same as last year\u2019s iPhone 16.\niPhone 17 Air\nA brand new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air will replace the Plus model in Apple\u2019s lineup. It will prioritize form over function, with a futuristic design that\u2019s thinner than ever, but sacrificing battery life and cameras in the process.\n- Ultra-thin form factor: Just 5.55mm thick, easily the thinnest iPhone ever.\n- 6.6-inch display: New screen size slots right in the middle of Pro and Pro Max.\n- A19 Pro chip w/ reduced GPU count: Apple\u2019s more powerful chip, but binned with only five GPU cores.\n- 24MP front-facing TrueDepth camera: The first selfie camera upgrade in years.\n- One rear camera: Only the Main camera, no Ultra Wide or Telephoto.\n- 12GB RAM: 50% increase over prior models\u2019 8GB.\n- ProMotion and always-on display: Formerly Pro-exclusive dynamic refresh rate features.\n- C1 modem: Apple\u2019s first in-house 5G modem.\n- Colors inspired by other Air products: Light Blue, Light Gold, Black, and Silver.\n- $949 price expected: $50 price increase over last year\u2019s Plus model.\niPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max\nApple\u2019s Pro models will continue being the best possible all-around iPhones this year. iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will come in the same 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch sizes as last year, but a lot of other features are changing.\n- New design: Full-width camera bar expands typical bump, and aluminum replaces titanium.\n- A19 Pro chip: The most powerful new iPhone chip with no compromises.\n- 24MP front-facing TrueDepth camera: The first selfie camera upgrade in years.\n- 48MP upgraded Telephoto camera: Up from 12MP, making all three rear cameras now 48MP.\n- Larger battery on Pro Max only: The king in battery life will extend its lead.\n- 12GB RAM: 50% increase over prior models\u2019 8GB.\n- Anti-reflective, more scratch resistant display: New upgrades to account for loss of ProMotion exclusivity.\n- More colorful colors: Orange and Dark Blue will join Silver and Black.\n- $1,049 and $1,249 prices expected: $50 price increases over last year.\nApple\u2019s iPhone 17 lineup: summary\nThe iPhone 17 lineup, thanks largely to the addition of the 17 Air, might make it harder than usual to choose the best model for you. Those considering the base iPhone 17 will get the benefit of ProMotion for the first time ever. iPhone 17 Air will feel the most futuristic, but also come with some compromises. And while iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max sound as strong as ever, they don\u2019t have the same \u201cbrand new\u201d appeal that the Air might.\nWhich iPhone 17 model do you plan to buy?

      "text": "All-New 'iPhone 17 Air' Rumored to Feature Single 48MP Rear Camera, 8GB of RAM, and More\nIn recent months, several credible sources have claimed that Apple plans to release a redesigned, significantly thinner iPhone 17 model next year. The device's name is not yet known, so we are referring to it as the \"iPhone 17 Air\" for now.\nThere have been conflicting rumors about the design and specifications for the device, but most sources have agreed that it will have around a 6.6-inch display. In July, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said he expects the device to have a standard A19 chip, a Dynamic Island, a single rear camera, and an Apple-designed 5G modem.\nIn a research note this week with investment bank Haitong International, analyst Jeff Pu agreed that the slim iPhone 17 model will have a 6.6-inch display, and an A19 chip manufactured with TSMC's same 3nm process that is used for the A18 Pro chip. He also expects the device to feature an aluminum frame, Face ID, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, a 24-megapixel front camera, and 8GB of RAM for Apple Intelligence.\nPu expects the slim iPhone 17 model to have a noticeable new design compared to previous iPhone models. He said the device will be a mid-tier iPhone that replaces the Plus model, as he does not expect an iPhone 17 Plus in next year's lineup.\nApple will likely unveil the \"iPhone 17 Air\" in September 2025, so the device is still far away from launching, and some features could change over time.\nPu has proven to be a mostly-accurate source of info for upcoming Apple products.\nPopular Stories\nApple's iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max models will feature a number of significant display, thermal, and battery improvements, according to new late-stage rumors.\nAccording to the Weibo leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" the iPhone 17 Pro models will feature displays with higher brightness, making it more suitable for use in direct sunlight for prolonged periods. The iPhone 16 Pro and...\nJust one week before Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 series, an analyst has shared new price estimates for the devices.\nHere are J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee's price estimates for the iPhone 17 series in the United States, according to 9to5Mac:\nModel\nStarting Price\nModel\nStarting Price\nChange\niPhone 16\n$799\niPhone 17\n...\nApple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 series on Tuesday, September 9, and last-minute rumors about the devices continue to surface.\nThe latest info comes from a leaker known as Majin Bu, who has shared alleged images of Apple's Clear Case for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, or at least replicas.\nImage Credit: @MajinBuOfficial\nThe images show three alleged changes compared to Apple's iP...\nApple will launch its new iPhone 17 series this month, and the iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to get a new design for the rear casing and the camera area. But more significant changes to the lineup are not expected until next year, when the iPhone 18 models arrive.\nIf you're thinking of trading in your iPhone for this year's latest, consider the following features rumored to be coming to...\nAn iPhone 17 announcement is a dead cert for September 2025 \u2013 Apple has already sent out invites for an \"Awe dropping\" event on Tuesday, September 9 at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California. The timing follows Apple's trend of introducing new iPhone models annually in the fall.\nAt the event, Apple is expected to unveil its new-generation iPhone 17, an all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17...\nWe're only days away from Apple's \"Awe dropping\" fall event scheduled to take place on Tuesday, September 9 \u2013 and along with the new iPhone 17 series, we're going to get a new version of the Apple Watch Ultra for the first time since 2023.\nBy the time the Ultra 3 is unveiled, it will have been two years since the previous model arrived. The intervening period has left plenty of room for..."

      "text": "Next year's iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature a titanium chassis just like the current Pro models, contrary to reports of Apple adopting aluminum across its 2025 lineup, claims the Weibo leaker known as \"Instant Digital.\"\nLast month, The Information's Wayne Ma reported that Apple's two flagship iPhone 17 Pro models would be the first high-end iPhones to feature an aluminum frame since the delineation of the iPhone lineup into Pro and non-Pro models.\nPrior to the iPhone 15 Pro, high-end iPhone models used stainless steel frames. Then Apple introduced a titanium chassis to the iPhone 15 Pro, touting it as a major upgrade. However, Ma reports that with the iPhone 17 lineup, Apple is planning to transition the entire range of devices back to aluminum.\nInstant Digital doesn't agree, though. \"Of course the iPhone 17 Pro will still use titanium,\" said the leaker in a Weibo post (machine translation). \"Why would anyone believe it would switch to aluminum? Think about it \u2014 it's just not possible. Looking back at recent iPhone models, Apple has consistently emphasized the premium frame materials of the Pro series as one of its key selling points, from 'surgical-grade stainless steel' to 'titanium.' If they switched to aluminum, how could they even market it?\"\nIt's unclear if the Weibo leaker has supply chain information to back up their claim, but as a standalone argument, it's not particularly water-tight. The Information's Ma reported that the switch to aluminum is part of a major design change that includes an aluminum upper back with a \"rectangular camera bump made of aluminum rather than traditional 3D glass,\" with the bottom half of the device's back continuing to be made of glass to support wireless charging.\nApple is also no stranger to touting breakthrough iPhone features only to remove them in later models. In 2015, for example, 3D Touch was introduced with the iPhone 6s as a revolutionary way to interact with the iPhone through pressure-sensitive gestures like Peek and Pop. Apple unceremoniously ditched 3D Touch and the capacitive sensors that enabled it with the iPhone 11 in 2019.\nInstant Digital has a mixed reputation for accuracy with Apple rumors but has delivered some notably precise predictions. These include the 2023 launch of the Yellow iPhone 14, the frosted back glass on the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, the Apple Watch Series 9 being a minor refresh, spatial video capture on the iPhone 15 Pro, the addition of a landscape front-facing camera to the iPad Air and iPad Pro, and the iPad Pro's nano-texture display option.\nThe iPhone 17 series is expected to launch as usual in the fall, with new display sizes, a rumored new ultra-thin model, ProMotion displays across the lineup, and more."

      "text": "We\u2019re just a few days away from Apple\u2019s special event, when the company is expected to announce the new iPhone 16 models. There are a lot of rumors about the new phones out there, but now 9to5Mac has heard more details about what changes with the new hardware. When it comes to cameras, users can expect improvements such as 4K 120fps video and more.\nNew camera features coming to iPhone 16 Pro\nReliable sources familiar with the matter have shown us evidence of what\u2019s new in the iPhone 16 Pro\u2019s camera. As previously rumored, the new Pro models will get a new 48-megapixel ultra-wide sensor, and our sources corroborate this information. What\u2019s more, the camera system will be exactly the same between the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max.\nThis means that both Pro models will have the tetraprism lens for 5x optical zoom, whereas it\u2019s exclusive to the Pro Max model in the current generation.\nBut what about new features? When it comes to videos, iPhone 16 Pro will shoot videos in 4K resolution at 120fps for the first time (iPhone 15 is currently limited to 4K 60fps). When connected to external storage, users will be able to shoot ProRes 4K at 120fps. In addition, Apple is upgrading QuickTake from 1080p to 4K.\nInterestingly, we\u2019ve also seen evidence that Apple has tested 8K video filming with the iPhone 16 Pro. Since an 8K image is around 35 megapixels, both wide and ultra-wide lenses would have enough resolution to shoot 8K video. Of course, the new A18 Pro chip seems to be ready for 8K as well.\nHowever, it\u2019s unclear whether Apple has decided to enable 8K on production devices, especially as the zoom lens would still be limited to 4K. Apple might save 8K for next year\u2019s iPhones, which are rumored to have a new, higher resolution zoom lens.\nOther tidbits are support for the JPEG-XL format for capturing lossy and lossless photos, pausing and resuming video recording in the Camera app, removal of wind noise for videos, multiple new Photographic Styles with better machine learning to preserve skin tones, and a new mode for capturing Spatial Photos that can be viewed in 3D on Apple Vision Pro.\nMore details on the Camera Button\nThe iPhone 16 models are also rumored to get a new dedicated camera button, and our sources have also given us more details about this. Internally called the \u201cCamera Button\u201d (the marketing name may differ), it will be a touch-sensitive button capable of reproducing different actions depending on how you press or slide it.\nA simple press will open the Camera app or a third-party app chosen by the user, a feature powered by the same iOS 18 API that lets users replace Apple\u2019s Camera app on the Lock Screen.\nWith a soft press, the Camera Button will trigger the auto-focus. A hard press will take the photo or start shooting video. Sliding your finger across the surface of the button will adjust zoom or exposure.\nLatest news on iPhone 16\niPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max are expected to keep the same design, but with larger displays. The new phones will also have a faster chip.\nThe Apple event will take place on Monday at 10 A.M. P.T.
