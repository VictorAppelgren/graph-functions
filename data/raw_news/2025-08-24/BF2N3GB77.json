      "text": "As Alan Bersten and Emma Slater concluded their Dancing With the Stars Live tour run, they sealed their final duet with a kiss.\nBersten, 30, and Slater, 36, closed out the evening with a sizzling routine during the Saturday, April 19, show in Rosemont, Illinois. In now-viral social media footage, Bersten could be seen pulling Slater in for a sweet smooch at the end as audience members erupted in cheers.\nThe two DWTS pros have not formally addressed their relationship status before Saturday\u2019s kiss, though a source exclusively told Us Weekly in late 2024 that Bersten and Slater were \u201chooking up.\u201d\nAccording to the insider, Bersten and Slater are not an out-in-the-open couple, but their romance was \u201cnot new\u201d and \u201congoing.\u201d\nSlater was previously married to fellow DWTS pro Sasha Farber for four years, ultimately filing for divorce in February 2023.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still like family, so it isn\u2019t really like the love is not there, it\u2019s actually not that at all,\u201d the British dancer said during an August 2023 appearance on \u201cThe Viall Files\u201d podcast. \u201cWe\u2019re just at potentially two different places. But the hard part was that the love actually didn\u2019t go [away].\u201d\nAt the time, Slater said their breakup came down to \u201cthe kid thing.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting because I do want to have kids. I just don\u2019t want to delay Sasha\u2019s path in having kids because I know that he is ready for that,\u201d Slater said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about him too much because that\u2019s really for him to say, but it\u2019s about kids. I do want kids. I don\u2019t know what it is, I\u2019m just figuring that out for myself. It\u2019s not something I take lightly and I don\u2019t want to enter into something that I\u2019m not sure about because I would never do that.\u201d\nSlater further noted that she and Farber, 40, did speak about expanding their family throughout their marriage, but she started to feel a \u201cresistance\u201d in the end.\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s been the real friction and the real hard part,\u201d Slater admitted. \u201cIt had nothing to do with him. He\u2019s always been very much himself. It\u2019s me that\u2019s found it difficult to understand why I\u2019m feeling different.\u201d\nSlater and Farber still remain on amicable terms, especially while they both still perform on DWTS.\n\u201cWe really are close friends,\u201d Slater told Us in June 2024. \u201cHe\u2019s somebody who\u2019s in my life forever. It\u2019s a true genuine connection and he\u2019s the best person, just absolutely amazing. We just get on really, really well.\u201d\nBersten, for his part, previously dated his DWTS season 27 partner Alexis Ren before they split in December 2018."

At the center of the drama was Elena\u2019s (Nina Dobrev) love triangle with Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Damon (Ian Somerhalder).\nOff screen, Dobrev and Somerhalder sparked a romance in 2010 and continued to date for three years.\n\u201cThe first time I was on the cover of Seventeen, the cover line said, \u2018Nina: Why She Wouldn\u2019t Date Any of Her Costars.\u2019 And then cut to two years later, [I am],\u201d Dobrev joked during an interview with Seventeen in October 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s funny that I said that, but you know what? It was honestly what I believed at the time.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be dating one of my costars \u2014 my goal on the show was to be professional. But sometimes you can\u2019t help who you have a connection with, and you can only fight it for so long \u2014 which I did for a really, really long time.\u201d\nThe pair broke up in 2013, but continued to work together for two more seasons. After their split, Somerhalder moved on with Nikki Reed. They wed in 2015 and share two kids together. Dobrev, meanwhile, has been in a relationship with Shaun White since 2020.\nTheir costar Wesley was already married to Torrey DeVitto when she made multiple appearances on The Vampire Diaries, but following their divorce, he had a new offscreen love interest.\nWesley was linked to Phoebe Tonkin, who appeared on The Vampire Diaries and The Originals as Hayley. They dated on and off for four years before calling it quits.\nKeep scrolling for more couples who happened behind the scenes of The Vampire Diaries:"

Their bond is so strong that in the season 4 finale, Eddie decided to change his will to give custody of his son Christopher (Gavin McHugh) to Buck in the event of his death.\n\u201cI know that there\u2019s a contingent of fans that would like a certain outcome and the [relationship] has a life of its own in fandom in that respect,\u201d showrunner Tim Minear told the Observer in May 2021. \u201cBut I do think that, look, at the very least, these are two guys who have a deep spiritual bond with each other.\u201d\nKeep scrolling for a look at the 9-1-1 cast\u2019s real-life dating histories:"

The Almost Famous actor made headlines when he ended his relationship with Parker, who was seven months pregnant with their son William at the time, in 2003 to pursue a romance with Claire Danes. Danes and Crudup dated until 2006.\n\u201cThat was really hard. I didn\u2019t know how to not do that,\u201d Danes said in an October 2015 appearance on The Howard Stern Show. \u201cI was just in love with him.

In 2003, when Parker was seven months pregnant with William, Crudup left her to pursue a relationship with Danes. She gave birth to their son in January 2004.\nFollowing their son\u2019s birth, Crudup emailed a New York Times interviewer writing a piece about him, requesting that \u201canything about the Mary-Louise Parker situation\u201d be left out. The actor noted to the reporter that the matter was \u201cpersonal, painful and involves an infant.\u201d\nWhile Parker has never directly mentioned what happened, in her 2015 memoir, Dear Mr. You, she alluded to the situation with Crudup. She recalled telling a cab driver that she was \u201cpregnant and alone\u201d and that it \u201churts to even breathe.\u201d\nThe twosome proved they were on good terms when Crudup attended the International Women of Vision Awards in New York City with William in 2019 to support Parker, who was being honored for her charitable work at the David Lynch Foundation.\nIn 2023, Parker also shared that she wished Watts and Crudup well after learning they got married.\n\u201cI honestly of course wish them every happiness because that\u2019s my son\u2019s father,\u201d she told The Guardian at the time. \u201cSo, I\u2019m happy for them.

Danes went on to welcome three kids with Hugh Dancy.\nDanes briefly mentioned her and Crudup\u2019s split in an interview in 2009.\n\u201cThat was a choice I made to fall in love,\u201d she explained to Blackbook. \u201cIt\u2019s unpleasant to be cast in such an unflattering role [in the tabloids], but I just had to remain steadfast. I was living with the same kind of integrity that I had always lived with.\u201d\nSeveral years later, Danes and Crudup reunited at the NYU Tisch Gala in April 2025. The twosome were seen sharing a hug and chatting after Crudup walked over to her table, per a video shared by People.\nNaomi Watts\nWatts and Crudup met while filming Gypsy in 2017, one year after Watts split from Liev Schreiber, with whom she shares sons Sasha and Kai.
