  "description": "ESET warns that at least two Russian hacking groups are using the zero-day flaw in WinRAR for cyberespionage purposes.",
  "content": "Russian hackers appear to be using a new flaw in WinRAR to try and spread malware to companies in Europe and Canada, according to security researchers.\n\nAntivirus provider ESET today provided more details about the WinRAR vulnerability, warning that a Russian hacking group called RomCom has been exploiting it for cyberespionage.\n\nThe bug, dubbed CVE-2025-8088, was quietly patched on July 30 with version 7.13 of WinRAR. But starting on Friday, the security community began sounding the alarm about the threat after ESET revealed RomCom had been abusing the flaw through phishing emails.\n\nThe flaw can be used to attack Windows PCs by letting a hacker create a malicious archive. Normally, WinRAR will extract files from an archive to a user-selected destination. But ESET researchers discovered the Russian hackers exploiting a bug in WinRAR, which can cause it to extract files to a hacker-selected destination on the PC.\n\nSpecifically, RomCom\u2019s booby-trapped archives can extract hidden malicious files to the Windows startup directory, causing a PC to immediately run them upon startup. The installed backdoors can then be used to secretly steal data from an infected computer.\n\nTo convince recipients to open the booby-trapped archive, the phishing emails pretended to come from interested job applicants and contained an attached resume inside the malicious RAR archive. The phishing email campaign lasted from July 18-21, \u201ctargeting financial, manufacturing, defense, and logistics companies in Europe and Canada,\u201d ESET says.\n\n\u201cAccording to ESET telemetry, none of the targets were compromised. The attackers, however, had conducted reconnaissance beforehand, and the emails were highly targeted. Successful exploitation attempts delivered various backdoors used by the RomCom group \u2013 specifically, a SnipBot variant, RustyClaw, and the Mythic agent,\u201d ESET added.\n\nThe vulnerability also affects 7.12 and earlier versions of WinRAR. ESET reported the threat to WinRAR on July 18, which led to its software developer rolling out a patch in version 7.13.\n\nHowever, WinRAR doesn\u2019t have an auto-update mechanism. So, users will need to manually install the new version to protect themselves from the flaw.\n\nIn another disturbing find, ESET added: \u201cWe are aware that this vulnerability has also been exploited by another threat actor, and was independently discovered by the Russian cybersecurity company BI.ZONE. Notably, this second threat actor began exploiting CVE\u20112025\u20118088 a few days after RomCom started doing so.\u201d\n\nBi.ZONE also reports the the hacking group \"Paper Werewolf\" abused the flaw in phishing emails that pretended to come from a Russian research institute.",

      "text": "ESET researchers have discovered a previously unknown vulnerability in WinRAR, being exploited in the wild by Russia-aligned group RomCom. This is at least the third time that RomCom has been caught exploiting a significant zero-day vulnerability in the wild. Previous examples include the abuse of CVE-2023-36884 via Microsoft Word in June 2023, and the combined vulnerabilities assigned CVE\u20112024\u20119680 chained with another previously unknown vulnerability in Windows, CVE\u20112024\u201149039, targeting vulnerable versions of Firefox, Thunderbird, and the Tor Browser, leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged-in user in October 2024.\nKey points of this blogpost:\n- If you use WinRAR or other affected components such as the Windows versions of its command line utilities, UnRAR.dll, or the portable UnRAR source code, upgrade immediately to the latest version.\n- On July 18th, 2025, ESET researchers discovered a previously unknown zero-day vulnerability in WinRAR being exploited in the wild.\n- Analysis of the exploit led to the discovery of the vulnerability, now assigned CVE-2025-8088: a path traversal vulnerability, made possible with the use of alternate data streams. After immediate notification, WinRAR released a patched version on July 30th, 2025.\n- The vulnerability allows hiding malicious files in an archive, which are silently deployed when extracting.\n- Successful exploitation attempts delivered various backdoors used by the RomCom group, specifically a SnipBot variant, RustyClaw, and Mythic agent.\n- This campaign targeted financial, manufacturing, defense, and logistics companies in Europe and Canada.\nRomCom profile\nRomCom (also known as Storm-0978, Tropical Scorpius, or UNC2596) is a Russia-aligned group that conducts both opportunistic campaigns against selected business verticals and targeted espionage operations. The group\u2019s focus has shifted to include espionage operations collecting intelligence, in parallel with its more conventional cybercrime operations. The backdoor commonly used by the group is capable of executing commands and downloading additional modules to the victim\u2019s machine.\nThe discovery of CVE-2025-8088\nOn July 18th, 2025, we observed a malicious DLL named msedge.dll in a RAR archive containing unusual paths that caught our attention. Upon further analysis, we found that the attackers were exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability affecting WinRAR, including the then-current version, 7.12. On July 24th, 2025, we contacted the developer of WinRAR, and on the same day, the vulnerability was fixed and WinRAR 7.13 beta 1 published. WinRAR 7.13 was published on July 30th, 2025. Users of WinRAR are advised to install the latest version as soon as possible to mitigate the risk. Note that software solutions relying on publicly available Windows versions of UnRAR.dll or its corresponding source code are affected as well, especially those that have not updated their dependencies.\nThe vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-8088, uses alternate data streams (ADSes) for path traversal. Note that a similar path traversal vulnerability (CVE\u20112025\u20116218) affecting WinRAR was disclosed on June 19th, 2025, approximately a month earlier.\nThe attackers specially crafted the archive to apparently contain only one benign file (see Figure 1), while it contains many malicious ADSes (there\u2019s no indication of them from the user\u2019s point of view).\nOnce a victim opens this seemingly benign file, WinRAR unpacks it along with all its ADSes. For example, for Eli_Rosenfeld_CV2 - Copy (10).rar, a malicious DLL is deployed into %TEMP%. Likewise, a malicious LNK file is deployed into the Windows startup directory, thereby achieving persistence via execution on user login.\nTo ensure higher success, the attackers provided multiple ADSes with increasing depths of parent directory relative path elements (..\\\\). However, this introduces nonexistent paths that WinRAR visibly warns about. Interestingly, the attackers added ADSes that contain dummy data and are expected to have invalid paths. We suspect that the attackers introduced them so that the victim does not notice the suspicious DLL and LNK paths (see Figure 2). Only when scrolling down in the WinRAR user interface are the suspicious paths revealed, as seen in Figure 3.\nCompromise chain\nAccording to ESET telemetry, such archives were used in spearphishing campaigns from the 18th to 21st July, 2025, targeting financial, manufacturing, defense, and logistics companies in Europe and Canada. Table 1 contains the spearphishing emails \u2013 sender, subject, and filename of the attachment \u2013 used in the campaigns, and Figure 4 shows the message we observed in an email. In all cases, the attackers sent a CV hoping that a curious target would open it. According to ESET telemetry, none of the targets were compromised.\nTable 1.

Some of the archives share the same malware. We have identified three execution chains.\nMythic agent execution chain\nIn the first execution chain, depicted in Figure 5, the malicious LNK file Updater.lnk adds the registry value HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\CLSID\\{1299CF18-C4F5-4B6A-BB0F-2299F0398E27}\\InprocServer32 and sets it to %TEMP%\\msedge.dll. This is used to trigger execution of that DLL via COM hijacking. Specifically, the CLSID corresponds to the PSFactoryBuffer object present in npmproxy.dll. As a result, any executable trying to load it (e.g., Microsoft Edge) will trigger code execution of the malicious DLL. This DLL is responsible for decrypting embedded shellcode via AES and subsequently executing it. Interestingly, it retrieves the domain name for the current machine, which typically contains the company name, and compares it with a hardcoded value, exiting if the two values do not match. This means that the attackers had conducted reconnaissance beforehand, confirming that this email was highly targeted.\nThe loaded shellcode appears to be a dynamichttp C2 profile for the Mythic agent having the following C&C server: https://srlaptop[.]com/s/0.7.8/clarity.js.\nIt comes with a standard configuration for the dynamichttp C2 profile and a custom one, which is displayed in Figure 6. Just like in the previous stage, this configuration contains a hardcoded domain name of the target.\n{'disable_etw': '2', 'block_non_ms_dlls': '3', 'child_process': 'wmic.exe', 'use_winhttp': 1, 'inject_method': '1', 'dll_side': ['MsEdge', 'OneDrive'], 'domain': '[REDACTED]'}\nSnipBot variant execution chain\nIn the second execution chain, which is depicted in Figure 7, the malicious LNK file Display Settings.lnk runs %LOCALAPPDATA%\\ApbxHelper.exe. It is a modified version of PuTTY CAC, which is a fork of PuTTY, and is signed with an invalid code-signing certificate. The extra code uses the filename as a key for decrypting strings and the next stage, which is shellcode. The shellcode appears to be a variant of SnipBot, malware attributed to RomCom by UNIT 42. Execution of the shellcode only proceeds if a specific registry value (68 for this sample) is present in the HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\RecentDocs\\ registry key (in other words, if at least 69 documents were recently opened); this is an anti-analysis technique to prevent execution in an empty virtual machine or sandbox. If at least 69 documents were recently opened, next-stage shellcode is decrypted using the registry key name (e.g., 68, but converted from string to integer), and executed, downloading yet another stage from https://campanole[.]com/TOfrPOseJKZ.\nWe also found an identical ApbxHelper.exe within Adverse_Effect_Medical_Records_2025.rar, uploaded to VirusTotal from Germany. This archive also exploits the CVE-2025-8088 vulnerability.\nMeltingClaw execution chain\nIn the third execution case, which is depicted in Figure 8, the malicious LNK file Settings.lnk runs %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Complaint.exe, which is RustyClaw \u2013 a downloader written in Rust previously analyzed by Talos. This sample is signed with an invalid code-signing certificate, which is different from the code-signing certificate used in the SnipBot variant. RustyClaw downloads and executes another payload, from https://melamorri[.]com/iEZGPctehTZ. This payload (SHA-1: 01D32FE88ECDEA2B934A00805E138034BF85BF83), with internal name install_module_x64.dll, partially matches the analysis of MeltingClaw by Proofpoint, a different downloader attributed to RomCom. The C&C server of the MeltingClaw sample that we observed is https://gohazeldale[.]com.\nAttribution\nWe attribute the observed activities to RomCom with high confidence based on the targeted region, TTPs, and malware used.\nThis is not the first time that RomCom has used exploits to compromise its victims. In June 2023, the group performed a spearphishing campaign targeting defense and governmental entities in Europe, with lures related to the Ukrainian World Congress. The Microsoft Word document attached to the email attempted to exploit the CVE\u20112023\u201136884 vulnerability, as documented by the BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team.\nOn October 8th, 2024, the group exploited a then-unknown vulnerability in the Firefox browser. The exploit targeted a use-after-free vulnerability in Firefox Animation timelines, allowing an attacker to achieve code execution in a content process, with the objective of delivering the RomCom backdoor. The vulnerability identifier CVE\u20112024\u20119680 was assigned, as documented in our WeLiveSecurity blogpost.\nOther activities\nWe are aware that this vulnerability has also been exploited by another threat actor, and was independently discovered by the Russian cybersecurity company BI.ZONE. Notably, this second threat actor began exploiting CVE\u20112025\u20118088 a few days after RomCom started doing so.\nConclusion\nBy exploiting a previously unknown zero-day vulnerability in WinRAR, the RomCom group has shown that it is willing to invest serious effort and resources into its cyberoperations. This is at least the third time RomCom has used a zero-day vulnerability in the wild, highlighting its ongoing focus on acquiring and using exploits for targeted attacks.

He developed good sources and did plenty of in-person \"shoe leather\" reporting to keep ahead of developments with major players such as Alibaba, and Xiaomi when it first started to break out. He travelled to manufacturing centers to do first-hand reporting on labor issues in the electronics supply chain, and proved to have a talent for both photography and video. Michael is also an unfailingly nice guy to work with, responsive to suggestions and feedback, and helpful to his colleagues as a collaborator. He offers any news organization seeking excellent coverage from China the triple qualifications of being a native English writer with excellent Mandarin skills and a good understanding of key technology topics.\u201d\nAbout\nActivity\n-\n\ud83c\udf89 Today I\u2019m not only celebrating my 1-\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc32 \u2014 I\u2019m also thrilled to announce that I\u2019ve been \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28\u2026\n\ud83c\udf89 Today I\u2019m not only celebrating my 1-\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc32 \u2014 I\u2019m also thrilled to announce that I\u2019ve been \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28\u2026\nLiked by Michael Kan\n-\nThis week I reached my 10-year anniversary with ICR and to mark the occasion, I've updated my professional headshots for my work-related social media\u2026\nThis week I reached my 10-year anniversary with ICR and to mark the occasion, I've updated my professional headshots for my work-related social media\u2026\nLiked by Michael Kan\n-\nI can't believe VIDEO GAME OF THE YEAR has been out for two whole years.

  "argos_summary": "Russian hackers, specifically the group RomCom, are exploiting a newly discovered vulnerability in WinRAR, identified as CVE-2025-8088, to distribute malware through phishing emails targeting companies in Europe and Canada. The vulnerability allows attackers to create malicious archives that can extract files to a hacker-selected destination on a victim's PC, enabling the installation of backdoors for data theft. Although a patch was released for the vulnerability, users must manually update their WinRAR software to mitigate the risk, as the software lacks an auto-update feature.",
