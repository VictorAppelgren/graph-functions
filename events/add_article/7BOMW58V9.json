      "summary": "A federal judge ruled against the Trump administration's efforts to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools, stating that the Education Department unlawfully threatened to cut federal funding for institutions maintaining such initiatives. The ruling followed a lawsuit from the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association, which argued that the government's memos imposed vague restrictions on educational practices. Meanwhile, in Mexico, the mayor of Celaya has replaced most of the local police force with national guard troops due to rampant cartel violence and police corruption, reflecting a broader trend of militarization in public security amid ongoing challenges in law enforcement.",
