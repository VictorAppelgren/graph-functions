      "feedback": "The draft does a credible job tying policy posture, AI-driven capex, and macro/commodity backdrops to a Regime A/B/C framework and to Nvidia-led momentum, but it needs a tighter causal chain, a defined horizon, stronger first-principles footing, explicit quantitative anchors, and a disciplined sourcing/consistency discipline to reach world-class quality; the current narrative often asserts regimes and effects (e.g., tariff shocks lifting supply‑side productivity or Regime A disinflation) without a transparent mechanism or measurable sensitivity, it conflates near‑term oil and euro‑area signals with longer‑horizon policy shifts, and it underpins many conclusions with qualitative language rather than sourced, engine‑level numbers; to upgrade, restructure into a formal three‑regime scenario tree with base/bear/bull states, assign explicit transition probabilities and invalidation events (wage‑growth momentum shifts, oil or semiconductor capex shocks, policy missteps, or a material wage breakout), and anchor every claim to a first‑principles chain (policy posture → tariffs/reshoring → AI/data‑center capex → productivity gains → gradual disinflation/real‑rate compression → lower risk premia → valuation uplift) with a transparent discount‑rate/earnings‑growth sensitivity, including a live 25–50bp rate‑move impact on multiples; add quantitative anchors for each driver (e.g., regime probability bands, projected 12–24 month productivity gains under Regime A, observable capex cadences for semis, oil–demand shale/refining trajectories) and translate them into earnings and pricing implications for key names (NVIDIA, Ford, ACMR) so you can present P/E, EV/EBITDA, and ROIC ranges under each scenario; tighten the sourcing discipline so every proposition has at least one ID from the SOURCE MATERIAL and reconcile any conflicts (e.g., oil regime probabilities vs euro‑area inflation paths) with a clear interpolation rule; enhance the watch list with explicit trigger thresholds (e.g., Jackson Hole policy signal X, semiconductor capex cadence deviation of ±Y%, oil prints Z) and tie each trigger to a source ID; ensure consistent regime labeling and remove stray punctuation or inconsistent capitalization (e.g., Regime A’s/Regime B’s) for readability; and when presenting results, keep the format compact—one integrated executive paragraph plus a concise, numbered watch-list—so the analysis remains clearly navigable and decision‑ready.",
