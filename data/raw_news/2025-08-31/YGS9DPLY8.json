  "title": "Trifecta Gold (CVE:TG) Is In A Strong Position To Grow Its Business",
  "description": "There's no doubt that money can be made by owning shares of unprofitable businesses. For example, Trifecta Gold...",
  "content": "There's no doubt that money can be made by owning shares of unprofitable businesses. For example, Trifecta Gold (CVE:TG) shareholders have done very well over the last year, with the share price soaring by 385%. But the harsh reality is that very many loss making companies burn through all their cash and go bankrupt.\n\nGiven its strong share price performance, we think it's worthwhile for Trifecta Gold shareholders to consider whether its cash burn is concerning. For the purpose of this article, we'll define cash burn as the amount of cash the company is spending each year to fund its growth (also called its negative free cash flow). The first step is to compare its cash burn with its cash reserves, to give us its 'cash runway'.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nWhen Might Trifecta Gold Run Out Of Money?\n\nYou can calculate a company's cash runway by dividing the amount of cash it has by the rate at which it is spending that cash. In June 2025, Trifecta Gold had CA$6.0m in cash, and was debt-free. Importantly, its cash burn was CA$517k over the trailing twelve months. So it had a very long cash runway of many years from June 2025. Even though this is but one measure of the company's cash burn, the thought of such a long cash runway warms our bellies in a comforting way. Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.\n\nHow Is Trifecta Gold's Cash Burn Changing Over Time?\n\nTrifecta Gold didn't record any revenue over the last year, indicating that it's an early stage company still developing its business. Nonetheless, we can still examine its cash burn trajectory as part of our assessment of its cash burn situation. Over the last year its cash burn actually increased by 25%, which suggests that management are increasing investment in future growth, but not too quickly. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but investors should be mindful of the fact that will shorten the cash runway. Admittedly, we're a bit cautious of Trifecta Gold due to its lack of significant operating revenues. We prefer most of the stocks on this list of stocks that analysts expect to grow.\n\nGiven its cash burn trajectory, Trifecta Gold shareholders may wish to consider how easily it could raise more cash, despite its solid cash runway. Generally speaking, a listed business can raise new cash through issuing shares or taking on debt. One of the main advantages held by publicly listed companies is that they can sell shares to investors to raise cash and fund growth. We can compare a company's cash burn to its market capitalisation to get a sense for how many new shares a company would have to issue to fund one year's operations.",

The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling.
