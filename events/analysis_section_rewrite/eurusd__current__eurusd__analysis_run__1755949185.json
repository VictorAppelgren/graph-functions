      "feedback": "**Actionable edit checklist (compact paragraph)**  \n1. **Cite the source consistently** – every claim about Trump’s disappointment, the cease‑fire deadline, or the potential easing of secondary sanctions must reference ID K8PPBLI93 (e.g., “Trump said… (K8PPBLI93)”).  \n2. **Quantify the impact** – replace vague “5–10 %” ranges with realistic price levels: e.g., Brent at $90 / bbl could rise to $95–$97 if sanctions ease; USD index at 95 could fall to 93–92; 10‑yr yield at 4.50 % could climb to 4.60–4.70 %.  \n3. **Add key thresholds** – list concrete trigger levels: Brent >$95, USD index <93, 10‑yr yield >4.60 % as signals of a sanctions‑easing scenario.  \n4. **Structure the narrative** – break the analysis into: (i) immediate driver (Trump’s statement), (ii) near‑term catalysts (meeting date, cease‑fire deadline, Treasury communiqués), (iii) positioning dynamics (commodity‑currency‑yield linkages), (iv) expected reaction function (price/level ranges), (v) invalidation points (no meeting, cease‑fire refusal, escalation), (vi) next‑watch items (EIA inventories, State Dept releases).  \n5. **Avoid generic platitudes** – replace “risk‑off sentiment dominates” with “market risk‑off is reflected in a 1–2 % drop in the USD index and a 5–10 bps rise in 10‑yr yields.”  \n6. **Reconcile conflicts** – if other sources contradict the article (e.g., a different cease‑fire deadline), note the discrepancy and weight the Bloomberg report as primary.  \n7. **Citation density** – aim for at least one citation per paragraph and for every distinct claim; use only the ID K8PPBLI93.  \n8. **First‑principles grounding** – explain why a U.S.‑Russia meeting without Ukraine would likely lead to sanctions easing (policy logic: Russia seeks bilateral leverage, U.S. seeks oil supply stability).  \n9. **Scenario specificity** – describe two scenarios: (a) meeting occurs, sanctions ease → commodity lift; (b) meeting canceled or cease‑fire demanded → sanctions remain → commodity stagnation.  \n10. **Monitoring signals** – list concrete next‑watch items: Trump’s press releases, Treasury sanctions announcements, EIA crude inventories, MOEX index movements.  \n\nImplement these edits to elevate the analysis to a world‑class, data‑driven, and citation‑rich forecast.",
