  "description": "The Duke of Sussex has reportedly barked out a list of demands ahead of his rumored peace talks with King Charles.",
  "content": "Prince Harry has reportedly dished out a list of demands ahead of his upcoming trip to the UK \u2014 and the duke\u2019s firm orders are said to have left palace courtiers \u201creeling.\u201d\n\nThe Duke of Sussex, 40, will reportedly meet with his estranged father, King Charles, next week \u2014 marking their first in-person reunion in 20 months.\n\nBut in order for the rumored peace talks to take place, Harry has reportedly barked out several requests that need to be fulfilled by the Windsor clan, according to top celebrity publicist Rob Shuter.\n\nIn his most-recent Substack, Jennifer Lopez\u2019s former PR honcho claimed that insiders close to the \u201cSpare\u201d author revealed some of the things on Harry\u2019s alleged list.\n\nAmong those is \u201cfull security\u201d for himself and his family, \u201cpress control\u201d that will be \u201ccoordinated by Buckingham Palace,\u201d and finally, for his wife, Meghan Markle, to be treated as HRH \u201ccomplete with bows and curtsies\u201d if she attends.\n\n\u201cFor William, that\u2019s a hard no,\u201d a source told Shuter. \u201cHarry doesn\u2019t want another trip where he feels unprotected and exposed.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants iron-clad guarantees \u2014 not vague promises. Security and privacy are non-negotiable,\u201d the insider added.\n\nThe Invictus Games founder previously insisted that having his family join him on future trips to the UK was not an option without \u201cfull police protection\u201d \u2014 for which he lost his appeal earlier this year.\n\nIt\u2019s understood, however, that Harry will be flying solo as his wife \u2014 who has not set foot in the UK since September 2022 \u2014 will remain in Montecito, Calif., with their two children, Archie, 6, and Lilibet, 4.\n\nFollow The Post\u2019s royal family live blog for the latest pics, news, exclusive details and more\n\nElsewhere, another insider claimed that King Charles \u201cwants peace and to see his son, but these demands risk blowing open old wounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry\u2019s offering reconciliation \u2014 but at a price. And that price includes the entire royal family bowing to Meghan,\u201d a source said.\n\nThe Post has reached out to Harry\u2019s reps, as well as Buckingham and Kensington Palaces for comment.\n\nThe former working royal\u2019s upcoming UK dash coincides with the third anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s death.\n\nIt also comes weeks after Harry\u2019s press team was seen meeting with the monarch\u2019s communications secretary for a top-secret discussion in London.\n\nWhile the rumored meet-up may suggest that things are heading in the right direction, Harry claimed in May that his cancer-stricken father was not speaking to him.\n\nStill, the father of two \u2014 who has been married to the \u201cSuits\u201d alum, 44, since 2018 \u2014 told the BBC that he would \u201clove a reconciliation\u201d with his estranged family.",

      "text": "World\u2019s best tennis players flock to this NYC Italian joint during US Open: \u2018They love it here\u2019\nGame, set, mangia!\nUS Open stars are loading up on the carbs before their matches at a tony Midtown Italian joint \u2014 where they dine near each other at night before trying to take one another down in Flushing.\n\u201cJannik Sinner, he like the pasta with the bolognese sauce,\u201d said Gustavo Hodzic, a co-owner of the hot spot Osteria Delbianco, to The Post on Tuesday, referring to the 24-year-old tennis sensation from Italy.\nThe East 49th Street eatery is so popular with Open aces that No.1-ranked Sinner and his 22-year-old court rival, No. 2 star Carlos Alcaraz of Spain, showed up to dinner there on the same night last week.\n\u201cWe run into each other. Just was a coincidence,\u201d Alcaraz later told reporters of the pair\u2019s chance encounter Thursday around 9 p.m. \u201cIt is a good restaurant.\u201d\nIt must be. The Spaniard dropped in a second time Monday.\nThe 2022 US Open victor has since advanced to the semifinals in Queens after knocking out the Czech Republic\u2019s Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka \u2014 another Delbianco devotee \u2014 on Tuesday in straight sets.\nSinner, the defending champ, will do battle in the quarterfinals Wednesday with fellow countryman Lorenzo Musetti, who himself dined at the Osteria on Sunday.\nThis pasta clearly packs a punch.\nPlayers such as Andrey Rublev, Lorenzo Musetti, Leylah Fernandez and Jasmine Paolini have also eaten at the restaurant during the tournament.\nConvenience is key. Many tennis pros stay in Midtown East hotels, in close proximity to the eatery, whose cuisine is inspired by chef Diego Bigucci\u2019s upbringing in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. There\u2019s also the restaurant\u2019s warm Italian vibe.\n\u201cThey feel very relaxed [here]. They feel at home,\u201d co-owner Dorjan Kalaja said of the space\u2019s famous tennis customers.\nFollow along for The Post\u2019s live coverage of the 2025 US Open\n\u201cThey love it here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey create such a wonderful atmosphere when they are here. People love them. Now we have a personal relationship with them.\u201d\nBut Sinner, who hails from Innichen in northern Italy, is special to the place.\n\u201cSinner, he like to cook \u2014 a good Italian cook,\u201d Bigucci said. \u201cSimple, traditional Italian cook. The father was a chef, worked in the kitchen as well. He likes the more traditional Italian food, what we do here.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of him.\u201d\nAlthough the meeting between the top seed and his fellow tennis titan from Spain was unplanned, the duo didn\u2019t clash at the eatery like they do on court, Hodzic noted.\n\u201cSinner came first, and after that, as soon as Alcaraz came in, they start talking and stuff, you know, like friends,\u201d the chef said. \u201cThey talked, they laughed. [They had] a very good time.\u201d\nSinner, who first started dining at Osteria Delbianco in 2020 shortly after it opened, knows his noodles, workers said.\nBut he\u2019s also a fan of the veal and scallops.\nOn Monday, Alcaraz scarfed down the gnocchi with a \u201clittle ragu and truffle\u201d and with a side of grilled fish and roasted potatoes, Hodzic said.\nIn the past, the Spanish ace has enjoyed the chicken diavolo and and risotto, alongside salmon.\nHe brought along a huge entourage of 11, including his father Carlos Alcaraz Gonz\u00e1lez, and his coach, former World No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero, on Monday.\n\u201cAround 8:30 p.m., Alcaraz\u2019s coach came in the door with two other people,\u201d Hodzic said. \u201cWe were busy. He told me, like, \u2018Do you have a table for us?\u2019 I said, \u2018Of course.\u2019 That corner table I left empty \u2014 if somebody coming, a player.\u201d\nNow into week two of the Open, there aren\u2019t many players left standing.\nBut Alcaraz and Sinner are still going strong.\nSo far this year, the Spanish hotshot and Italian big-hitter have met at finals of the French Open, where Alcaraz won, and Wimbledon, where Sinner took the trophy.\nNext up could be at Sunday\u2019s final in Arthur Ashe Stadium \u2014 or over a plate of pasta."

      "text": "Prince Harry broke this \u2018cardinal rule\u2019 ahead of secret peace talks with King Charles\u2019 aides: expert\nPrince Harry broke a \u201ccardinal rule\u201d in the lead up to last week\u2019s secret peace talks between his communications team and King Charles\u2019 press rep, according to a royal expert.\nRoyal commentator Charlotte Griffiths claims the Duke of Sussex breached a fundamental protocol by publicly discussing private matters concerning his estranged family.\nAfter Harry aired out his family\u2019s dirty laundry on several public platforms \u2014 including the bombshell 2021 sit-down interview with Oprah Winfrey, his and Meghan Markle\u2019s tell-all Netflix series and his memoir \u201cSpare\u201d \u2014 the king is now very cautious when interacting with his youngest son, Griffiths claims.\n\u201cI think he would be willing to meet his demands and it is a pretty simple demand, it is \u2018if I talk to you, can it not leak out on Oprah Winfrey or any other program?'\u201d Griffiths said of the king\u2019s requirements for any future communication with the exiled royal.\n\u201cHarry really wants reconciliation and to be able to freely speak to his father, at the moment he cannot get through to his father, he has to go through his aides,\u201d she added.\n\u201cWhat will definitely happen is some ground rules for communications. What Harry cannot do is repeat what goes on in private conversations,\u201d she noted.\nIn an interview with the BBC in May, Harry said he would \u201clove a reconciliation\u201d with his cancer-stricken father as the Invictus Games founder alluded to King Charles\u2019 health being far worse than His Majesty has let on.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer my father has,\u201d Harry told the outlet, claiming the king \u201cwon\u2019t speak\u201d to him.\nAccording to Griffiths, Harry\u2019s choice of words weren\u2019t received well at Buckingham Palace.\n\u201cHarry said \u2018we don\u2019t know how much time my father has left\u2019 and that went down extremely badly, that\u2019s why this story is so surprising,\u201d she said. \u201cHe broke the cardinal rule which was speculating on the king\u2019s health.\u201d\nPrince Harry\u2019s fueling of public speculation about his ailing father was a clear violation of royal protocol, Griffiths added.\nWhile reps for the Sussexes, Meredith Maines and Liam Maguire were spotted chatting to Tobyn Andreae, the monarch\u2019s communications secretary, the meeting notably excluded Prince William and Princess Catherine\u2019s communications team.\nAccording to the royal commentator, the future king, 43, has no interest in mending fences with his estranged brother.\n\u201cWilliam is in perfect health and is in no rush to make amends with his brother,\u201d she noted.\n\u201cI think the king will have let William know this was his approach and there would have been a certain conversation. But I don\u2019t think William will want to get involved,\u201d Griffiths said.\nGriffiths added that the king\u2019s health woes might be the reason behind his willingness to reconcile.\n\u201cI think this is driven by the king\u2019s health in the respect that the king is very circumspect at the moment and is perhaps in a more forgiving place,\u201d she added."

      "text": "Prince Harry loses final bid for taxpayer-funded UK security\nPrince Harry has lost his appeal against the UK government over taxpayer-funded security.\nDuring a two-day hearing at a London court last month, the Duke of Sussex, 40, claimed he had been singled out for \u201cunjustified and inferior treatment\u201d when he and his family were stripped of their publicly funded security detail.\nOn Friday, Sir Geoffrey Vos, Lord Justice David Bean and Lord Justice Andrew Edis announced the ruling \u2014 which comes as a huge blow to the \u201cSpare\u201d author and his wife, Meghan Markle, who has refused to return to the UK following Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral in September 2022.\nThe appeal was widely considered Harry\u2019s final shot at winning back the security detail.\nIt is not yet known whether the Invictus Games founder will be allowed to apply for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court following the ruling.\nDelivering the ruling, Vos noted that while Harry\u2019s arguments were \u201cpowerful and moving,\u201d he \u201ccould not say that the duke\u2019s sense of grievance translated into a legal argument for the challenge to\u201d the decision by the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (RAVEC).\n\u201cThe conclusion, in my judgment, with which my colleagues Lord Justice Bean and Lord Justice Edith agreed, was that the Duke of Sussex\u2019s appeal would be dismissed,\u201d he added.\nThe Home Office, which has ultimate legal authority over RAVEC, rejected Harry\u2019s appeal.\nIts legal team asserted that the decision was made in an exceptional context and that there were no valid grounds to contest it.\n\u201cThe duke was in effect stepping in and out of the cohort of protection provided by RAVEC,\u201d Vos said while reading a summary of the court\u2019s decision Friday.\n\u201cOutside the UK, he was outside the cohort, but when in the UK, his security would be considered as appropriate.\u201d\n\u201cIt was impossible to say that this reasoning was illogical or inappropriate, indeed it seemed sensible,\u201d he said, adding that the decision was \u201cunderstandable and perhaps predictable.\u201d\nThe Post has reached out to Harry\u2019s reps for comment.\nDuring his April court hearing, Harry complained about not feeling safe enough to return to his home soil with his wife and their two children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, because \u201cit is too dangerous.\u201d\nThe duke\u2019s lawyers added that the UK\u2019s treatment of him was \u201cunlawful and unfair,\u201d and warned of \u201cthe impact on the UK\u2019s reputation of a successful attack\u201d against him.\nHarry\u2019s legal team also mentioned the duke\u2019s failed bid to hire armed bodyguards from London\u2019s Metropolitan Police on his own dime \u2014 a request that was refused last year.\nIn February 2024, London\u2019s High Court ruled to strip the Sussexes of taxpayer-funded UK security protection.\nThe father of two \u2014 who lives in Montecito, California, with his family \u2014 was ordered to pay 90% of the UK Home Office\u2019s legal costs for defending the court\u2019s initial ruling.\nSir Peter Lane, the judge of the High Court, ruled that there was no unlawfulness in stripping the Sussexes of their security in February 2020 following their shocking departure from royal life the month prior.\nFollowing the ruling, Harry has made it his mission to win the security detail back for him and his family \u2014 but has notably received zero help from the royals."

There\u2019s no point continuing to fight anymore, life is precious,\u201d Harry said.\nHis latest clash with the king stems from Harry\u2019s appeal to maintain his tax-payer funded security detail since moving to America \u2014 which he lost on Friday.\nThe legal team behind the decision said it would not be appropriate for Harry to have the publicly-paid-for security since shirking his royal duties.\nHarry said Charles \u201cwon\u2019t speak to me because of this security stuff\u201d \u2014 but admitted \u201cI can\u2019t see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the UK at this point,\u201d he told the BBC after the court defeat.\nIn a rare statement, Buckingham Palace told the BBC: \u201cAll of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.\u201d\nThe prince called the legal showdown a \u201cgood old-fashioned establishment stitch up,\u201d and said he believes the Royal Family influenced the outcome.\n\u201cI\u2019m devastated \u2014 not so much as devastated with the loss that I am about the people behind the decision, feeling as though this is okay. Is it a win for them?\u201d he questioned.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there are some people out there, probably most likely the people that wish me harm, [who] consider this a huge win,\u201d he added.\nDuring a two-day hearing at a London court last month, Harry claimed he had been singled out for \u201cunjustified and inferior treatment\u201d when he and his family were stripped of their security detail when they stepped away from Royal life.\nOn Friday, Sir Geoffrey Vos, Lord Justice David Bean and Lord Justice Andrew Edis announced the ruling \u2014 a blow to Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, who has refused to return to the UK following Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral in September 2022."

Palace insiders tell #ShuterScoop the Duke of Sussex has issued a list of demands so bold it has royal courtiers reeling.\nAccording to sources, Harry, 40, is demanding three major concessions before he\u2019ll agree to sit down with his cancer-stricken father:\n\u2022 Full security for himself, Meghan, and their children while in the UK \u2014 funded by the King.\n\u2022 Press control coordinated by Buckingham Palace to keep paparazzi at bay.\n\u2022 Meghan treated as HRH \u2014 complete with bows and curtsies, despite her stepping down as a working royal.\n\u201cHarry doesn\u2019t want another trip where he feels unprotected and exposed,\u201d one insider explains. \u201cHe wants iron-clad guarantees \u2014 not vague promises. Security and privacy are non-negotiable.\u201d\nThe Meghan clause, however, is the real flashpoint. \u201cHarry insists Meghan must be treated as HRH,\u201d the source stresses. \u201cThat means family member must show her the formal respect of bows and curtsies. For William, that\u2019s a hard no.\u201d\nCharles, insiders say, is torn. \u201cHe wants peace and to see his son,\u201d one palace veteran explains. \u201cBut these demands risk blowing open old wounds.\u201d\nAs one courtier put it: \u201cHarry\u2019s offering reconciliation \u2014 but at a price. And that price includes the entire royal family bowing to Meghan.\u201d\nEXCLUSIVE: DESIGNERS LINING UP TO DRESS TAYLOR SWIFT \u2014 \u201cTHE MOST IMPORTANT GOWN SINCE PRINCESS DIANA\u2019S WEDDING\u201d\nTaylor Swift\u2019s wedding to NFL superstar Travis Kelce isn\u2019t just a cultural moment \u2014 it\u2019s the fashion world\u2019s Super Bowl. Industry insiders tell #ShuterScoop that top designers across the globe are battling for the once-in-a-lifetime honor of creating her wedding gown.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a dress \u2014 it\u2019s history,\u201d one fashion executive gushes. \u201cTaylor\u2019s gown will be the most important since Princess Diana\u2019s. Whoever lands it becomes immortal.\u201d\nThe calls are already pouring in. Valentino, Versace, Dior, and Oscar de la Renta are all pushing for the job. Vera Wang, who famously designed gowns for Mariah Carey and Victoria Beckham, has made her interest known. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeding frenzy,\u201d whispers one insider. \u201cSketches, fabrics, archival ideas \u2014 everything\u2019s being thrown at Taylor\u2019s camp.\u201d\nSwift, however, is playing her cards close. \u201cTaylor knows the power she has,\u201d a close friend says. \u201cOne dress, one designer, one photo \u2014 and the entire industry will be defined by it for decades.\u201d\nThe stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. \u201cForget the Oscars, forget the Met Gala,\u201d says another source. \u201cThis gown will set trends worldwide. Brides from Des Moines to Dubai will want a piece of Taylor\u2019s magic.\u201d\nAs one fashion insider put it bluntly: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a wedding. It\u2019s the coronation of couture.\u201d\nEXCLUSIVE: JIMMY FALLON & SETH MEYERS \u2018ONLY SAFE WHILE LORNE MICHAELS IS AROUND\u2019 \u2014 FUTURE IN DOUBT AFTER HIS RETIREMENT\nBehind NBC\u2019s polished late-night facade, insiders whisper that Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers\u2019 futures hinge on one man: Lorne Michaels.\nThe 80-year-old Saturday Night Live creator, who also executive produces The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Late Night with Seth Meyers, recently insisted both hosts are \u201csafe\u201d despite CBS abruptly axing Stephen Colbert. But #ShuterScoop hears that \u201csafety\u201d vanishes the moment Michaels retires.\n\u201cJimmy and Seth are protected because of Lorne \u2014 full stop,\u201d one NBC insider explains. \u201cOnce he steps down, executives won\u2019t hesitate to clean house.\u201d\nRatings for both Fallon and Meyers have sagged, with viewers flocking to YouTube, TikTok, and podcasts. Fallon still delivers viral games and impressions, but insiders say it isn\u2019t enough to justify his mega salary. \u201cWithout Lorne, there\u2019s no buffer,\u201d another source notes. \u201cThe knives are already out.\u201d\nMichaels has hinted he\u2019ll retire soon after SNL\u2019s 50th anniversary season, leaving both hosts dangerously exposed. \u201cHe\u2019s the kingmaker,\u201d the insider adds. \u201cBut once the king leaves the throne, the palace gets rebuilt. And Jimmy and Seth may not be in it.\u201d\nAs one rival network exec puts it: \u201cLate-night is collapsing. Without Lorne, NBC will burn it down and start over.\u201d\n#ShuterScoop"

However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21.
