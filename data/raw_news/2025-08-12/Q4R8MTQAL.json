  "title": "Air Canada Says Labor Talks at Impasse After 38% Offer to Union",
  "description": "Air Canada, Canada\u2019s largest airline, says labor negotiations are \u201cat an impasse\u201d after tabling a sweetened offer to the union representing its 10,000 flight attend\u2026",
  "content": "In a statement Tuesday afternoon, the carrier said the union \u201csubmitted a counteroffer seeking exorbitant increases, beyond those presented in earlier submissions, and today rejected an offer by the company to enter binding, third-party arbitration.\u201d The parties \u201cremain far apart on key issues,\u201d it added.\n\nAir Canada offered to increase total compensation, including benefits and bonuses, by 25% in the first year and 38% over four years, the company said. That\u2019s more than a previous offer of 20% in the first year and 32.5% over four years, as reported by Bloomberg News.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Please try again\n\nUnion members voted 99.7% to strike last week. The parties will be in a position to issue a 72-hour strike or lockout notice at 12:01 a.m. New York time on Wednesday, shutting down the airline as early as Aug. 16.\n\nReached by phone, a union spokesperson said, \u201cThe parties are still at the bargaining table. So all energies right now are being focused on trying to get to a deal.\u201d\n\nAny labor action could, per day, ground about 700 mainline and Air Canada Rouge flights, and leave approximately 130,000 passengers behind. A strike or lockout would not impact the nearly 300 flights of Air Canada Express, which is operated by PAL Airlines Ltd.\n\nThe offer, disclosed on CUPE\u2019s website, was rejected. \u201cArbitrators rely on precedent and the status quo to make their determinations,\u201d the union\u2019s bargaining committee wrote. \u201cAir Canada wants an arbitrator to do their dirty work for them to keep the status quo intact.\u201d\n\nThe airline also agreed to pay workers for some of the time they spend on the ground, but the union is seeking 100% pay for all hours worked. Currently, Air Canada flight attendants are only paid when the aircraft is in motion and not for work such as boarding \u2014 a common practice in the industry, but one that\u2019s increasingly being challenged.\n\nAir Canada\u2019s latest 10-year contract with its flight attendants expired at the end of March. The company and the union have been negotiating for the past eight months. The airline said it\u2019s looking at all remaining options, including a request for government-directed arbitration.",
