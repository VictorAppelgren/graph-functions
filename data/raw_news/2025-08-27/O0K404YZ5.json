  "title": "Taylor Swift Is Engaged. Her Post Is Climbing Instagram's Most-Liked List",
  "description": "The post is now at No. 8 for non-soccer related posts, with 30 million likes.  Plus: Memes, and details on her dress, his sweater and that ring.",
  "content": "Nobody is shaking this off: Pop superstar Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce announced their engagement on Instagram on Tuesday, and the likes exploded like pyrotechnics at a concert. The post broke Instagram's record for reposts, even though, to be fair, reposting just started on Instagram in August. Still, the post hit 1 million reposts in less than 6 hours and earned 14 million likes in just the first hour.\n\nBy Wednesday, it had topped 30 million likes, vaulting it to number eight on Instagram's list of top non-soccer posts.\n\n\"Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,\" Swift and Kelce wrote on an Instagram post showing multiple photos of the proposal. In the first photo, Kelce is kneeling in front of Swift in a breathtaking floral garden. The second photo shows them standing and holding one another. The next is her hand with an enormous diamond engagement ring, followed by two more of the couple embracing.\n\nThe post also features a dynamite emoji and the audio of Swift's 2024 song So High School. The snippet cuts off with the lyrics, \"Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me?\" (Let's hope it's the first or second option.)\n\nInstagram post is already climbing into the millions\n\nAs you might expect, the Instagram post delivering the engagement news shot into the stratosphere as soon as it was posted. A representative for Instagram confirmed to CNET that Swift and Kelce's engagement announcement earned over 14 million likes and 452,000 reposts in just over an hour.\n\nThat's a huge audience, but it will be interesting to see how high up Swift and Kelce's engagement news post lands on Instagram's all-time most popular list.\n\nRight now, the most popular post ever on Instagram is from 2022, when soccer star Lionel Messi posted an image of himself hoisting the just-won World Cup. That post has more than 74 million likes. (Swifties, keep it going if you want to send the Swift-Kelce post to the top.)\n\nThe Instagram representative didn't immediately comment on whether Swift and Kelce's post is climbing at the same pace as Messi's. Messi also has the third-most popular post, again showing him and the World Cup trophy, this time snuggled up in bed together.\n\nBut it's not just soccer photos that top the Instagram most-viewed-ever list. The second most-liked post of all time is a photo of a plain, ordinary egg, posted to the social network back in 2019 as part of someone's experiment to see if such a mundane image could go hugely viral. I interviewed the person behind Eugene the Egg back in 2019 and am shocked to see it's still in the No. 2 spot six years later, with more than 60 million likes.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the post had reached 30 million likes, and was sitting at number eight on Instagram's list of top posts that aren't soccer-related. If it can garner 900,000 more likes, it can jump into seventh place, passing a reel of a smiley baby.\n\nDetails on the ring and outfits\n\nAccording to The New York Post, Swift is wearing a blue silk-blend Polo Ralph Lauren dress in the photo, and Kelce is wearing a navy cable-knit Polo Ralph Lauren sweater. The Post also reports that Swift's new engagement ring is \"an old mine brilliant-cut diamond in a gold bezel setting, which was designed by Kelce himself with the help of Kindred Lubeck of Artifex Fine Jewelry.\"\n\nOld mine refers to a historic diamond cut popular from the early 18th century to the late 19th century. Such diamonds are square with rounded corners and have 58 facets, making them anything but a \"paper ring.\"\n\nThe Post delved into everything else Swift had on, including her cognac-colored Louis Vuitton sandals, $18,000 diamond-studded Cartier Santos Demoiselle watch and her \"TNT\" friendship bracelet by Wove, which was a Christmas gift from her new fianc\u00e9.\n\nTo no one's shock, the $400 dress Swift is wearing is selling out fast. Just imagine the excitement when the wedding details start trickling out, and Swift begins to \"pick out a white dress,\" as Juliet does in Swift's hit song Love Story.\n\nUntil we have more information about the upcoming wedding, fans will have to content themselves by creating and sharing memes because, well, it's 2025, and that's part of how we communicate these days.\n\nThe Instagram account belonging to the Prince and Princess of Wales even liked the post. (No surprise, really, they hung out when Swift played London.)\n\nEven coffee giant Starbucks got into the act, making a joke about pumpkin spice lattes and posting, \"Are we supposed to keep posting about PSL like nothing happened?\" The company also noted in the post's comments that \"the long list of Starbucks lovers just got a +1.\" (\"Starbucks lovers\" is a sly reference to a lyric in Swift's 2014 song Blank Space. Swift actually sings, \"got a long list of ex-lovers,\" but almost anyone with working ears mishears it as something like, \"all the lonely Starbucks lovers.\")\n\nOne meme post on X showed Paul Revere's famed ride, captioned \"me telling everyone I know that Taylor Swift got engaged.\"\n\nOne Bluesky user wrote, \"Very interesting that Taylor Swift got engaged mere months after I did. Get your own thing.\"\n\nAnother joked, \"Can't believe that on July 8th, 2023, @likethe309, Travis Kelce and I all walked into Arrowhead Stadium to attend the Eras Tour and now one of us is marrying Taylor Swift.\"\n\nMatt Ufford warned the billionaire bride-to-be and her millionaire NFL star husband to count their pennies, writing, \"a word of warning to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce: weddings can get EXPENSIVE, fast, be sure to leave enough in the account for your monthly expenses.\"\n\nThere were football jokes, of course.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press sought a local connection, using the headline, \"Tight end for Detroit Lions' Week 6 opponent gets engaged to Taylor Swift.\"\n\nOne person questioned the caption about an English teacher marrying a gym teacher, asking, \"Why does Taylor Swift think she's an English teacher and not a music teacher?\"\n\nWe're pretty sure this person really does know who Swift is, but their post was funny anyway. It reads, \"Okay, I'll bite: who's Taylor Swift? What's so great about him?\"\n\nThe two 35-year-old celebrities have been dating for two years. It's a love story, and Taylor just said yes.",

      "text": "So it's 2019, and everything is backwards. The government's shut down. Britain's breaking up with Europe. A plain ordinary egg is now the most-liked photo ever posted to Instagram , and that egg just emailed me.\nThe egg photo was posted on Jan. 4, and as of Jan. 15, it has more than 42 million likes. The account, titled world_record_egg, has 6.3 million followers. But so far, no one has been able to crack the identity of the person behind the account.\nBut I can tell you the egg has a name and is egg-ceptionally thankful for all the attention.\n\"Eugene the Egg is so appreciative of the amazing support, it has been incredible,\" the person behind the Instagram account told me in an email.\nWhen asked about the account's merchandise offerings -- currently, two shirts that say \"I LIKED THE EGG\" -- the response was, \"We're dropping a new design every day, and giving 10 percent of that to a chosen charity.\"\nAn Instagram personality who goes by Supreme Patty and has 6.2 million followers was rumored to be behind the egg. TMZ quoted a reported friend of Supreme Patty saying he was responsible, but the egg account later posted to TMZ via Instagram Stories that \"we're still anonymous. Fake news.\"\nThe egg confirmed this to me, writing, \"We deny that we are Supreme Patty,\" but would offer no more details about his or her identity.\nAccording to the UK Telegraph, the poster of the egg image lives in London, and took inspiration from a list of record-setting Instagram posts from 2018.\n\"I thought it would be an interesting experiment to try and beat the record with something as basic as possible,\" the egg poster told the Telegraph, \"which led to me deciding on the egg.\"\nAs for Supreme Patty, although he may not be the person behind the egg, he's having fun with it, and is now urging followers to help break the record for most shrimp emoji Instagram comments on an egg-related post of his own.\nHe also posted video of himself apparently getting a tattoo of the egg. \"You're so gonna regret that wtf,\" wrote Instagram user joonerboi.\nTurns out there are many famous pop-culture eggs out there.\nGeorge R.R. Martin, author of the books that inspired HBO's hit Game of Thrones, got in on the egg-ceptional mockery by tweeting a photo of one of the famous dragon eggs from the show, with the words, \"I, too, have a famous egg...\"\nOr course, someone had to turn it into a \"Where's the Winds of Winter?\" demand.\nTurns out Martin's not alone in his egg yolking. Harry Potter fans point out that their book and movie series also has a prominent egg. Retrieving the magical golden egg was part of the Triwizard Tournament detailed in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.\nBut eggs aren't for everyone. Wrote Christine Sydelko on Twitter, \"I'm unfollowing everyone who liked that egg photo.\"\nNASA turns 60: The space agency has taken humanity farther than anyone else, and it has plans to go further.\nTaking It to Extremes: Mix insane situations -- erupting volcanoes, nuclear meltdowns, 30-foot waves -- with everyday tech. Here's what happens."

      "text": "Impeccable origin\nOld Mine Cut: A Guide to a Storied Diamond Shape\nThe Old Mine Cut is a historic diamond cut that was the most common diamond cut from the early 18th century to the late 19th century, which corresponds to the Georgian and Victorian era. During the height of the popularity of this engagement ring cut, diamonds were cut by hand and their measurements were eyeballed.\nOld Mine Cut diamonds are square shaped with rounded corners and have 58 facets. However, no two Old Mine Cut diamonds are alike. You can recognize one by its small table, larger culet, and high crown.\nOld Mine cuts have grown in popularity over the years, and are now highly sought-after following Taylor Swift\u2019s engagement to Travis Kelce. Swift\u2019s engagement ring features an 8-carat bezel-set Old Mine cut diamond.\nExplore VRAI's full inventory of lab-grown diamond shapes to learn more about each diamond cut.\nHow Do I Identify an Old Mine Cut Diamond?\nOld Mine Cut diamonds have 58 facets, just like the modern-day Round Brilliant Cut, but the proportions largely differ from the ones sported in modern-era cuts. Compared to Round Brilliant diamonds, their table is smaller, their crown higher and their culet larger. In addition, their shape is more square than round.\nDiamond cutters fashioned Old Mine diamonds by following the shape of the diamond\u2019s octahedral crystal. Because these diamonds predated modern technology, they were all cut by hand, so they lack a standardized and unified look and can be slightly asymmetrical.\nBest Settings for Old Mine Diamond Engagement Rings\nOld Mine diamonds work with engagement ring settings that emphasize their fire and their vintage-inspired feel.\nThe Flat Edge Bezel\nFor a bold, modern look \u2014 and a nod to Taylor Swift\u2019s famous Old Mine cut engagement ring \u2014 choose a sleek Flat Edge Bezel. A flat, tapered band enhances its structured look, while the bezel and cathedral bridge invite light to flow through in this design.\nThe Signature Bezel\nWanting to recreate Taylor Swift\u2019s Old Mind cut engagement ring in a more traditional style? Choose the Signature Bezel for a vintage-inspired design that will highlight the center stone to perfection.\nThe Three Stone\nA Three Stone setting with Baguette side stones frames the Old Mine Cut\u2019s unique faceting in an elegant way. Choose this for a thoroughly vintage-inspired feel.\nThe Floating Split Band\nThis style is reminiscent of designs popular in the Georgian and Victorian era, so it naturally suits an Old Mine Cut diamond. Select this style for a timeless ring with a twist.\nThe Classic Two Tone\nThe Classic Two Tone setting is vintage-inspired too as having prongs and shank in different colors was typical of 19th and early 20th century jewelry design.\nOld Mine Cut Detail\nHistory of the Old Mine Cut Diamond\nThe term Old Mine cut was first used in the late 1800s despite the cut\u2019s actual popularity starting in the early 1700s. It has also been called the \u201cOld Miners Cut\u201d and the \u201cMiners Cut\u201d. At the time,Old Mine specifically identified any colorless or near colorless diamonds hailing from Indian and Brazilian mines, as opposed to the newly discovered mines in Africa, whose production and output was gaining more and more prominence.\nSubsequently, it came to indicate any diamond in that cut that had a high color grade, regardless of provenance, and eventually, it defined all diamonds that had a square-ish shape, a high crown, a small table, and a large culet.\nNotable Diamond: The Grand Mazarin Diamond\nThe Grand Mazarin is a diamond with 17 crown and 17 pavilion facets that became its own cut. The shape, however, contains some visual similarities to what would then become the Old Mine diamond.\nCardinal Mazarin was the Chief Minister of France from 1642 to 1661 and was the de facto ruler when king Louis XIV was still a child. He accumulated a substantial diamond collection: he financed the trips to India of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a pioneer of the diamond trade. He bequeathed 18 diamond jewels to the Crown of France. Among these is the Grand Mazarin diamond, a 19.07-carat pink diamond.\nIt was extracted at Golconda. This part of the Indian plateau of Deccan is where some of the most visually remarkable diamonds were unearthed. These include the Koh-I-Noor, the Regent, the Wittelsbach-Graff.\nThe Peruzzi Diamond\nThe Peruzzi diamond is a diamond that then set the standard for its own cut\u2013the Peruzzi cut, and was created in the 17th century in Venice by Vincenzo Peruzzi. The Peruzzi diamond is credited for being the first diamond consisting of 57 facets, a table, and a culet. It is a square-ish diamond with a small rectangular notch in the top left or right corner. Note that one of the corners has a small cut-out, which ensures that if the diamond falls on its corner, it won't break easily. Given its square-ish shape and the numbers of facets, it can be considered a precursor to the Old Mine diamond.\nWhat Is the Difference Between Old European and Old Mine Diamond?\nIt\u2019s easy to confuse the Old Mine Cut with the Old European diamond. The easiest way to tell them apart is to compare their two diagrams. In the case of the Old Mine cut, it has a square-ish shape, a small table but large diamond-shaped facets on the crown, and large facets on the pavilion coupled with a large culet.\nThe Old European cut is round in shape, and its facets (including the culet) are smaller and more symmetrical than the one found in the Old Mine diamonds.\nBoth shapes have a greater total depth compared to modern Round Brilliant diamonds.\nHow Does an Old Mine Cut Diamond Compare to Modern Shapes?\nThe Old Mine Cut is a historical cut that was the basis of the Cushion cut due to its rounded corners and square-ish shape. It bears some similarities with the Round Brilliant Cut too, even though the Old Mine cut is square-ish in shape rather than round.\nOld Mine Cut vs Round Brilliant Diamond\nThe Round and the Old Mine Cut diamond share the same number of facets (57-58) and have a similar faceting pattern, as both are considered Brilliant cutsen. That\u2019s where the similarities end. The Old Mine diamond has a square shape, the Round Brilliant is round and symmetrical. The Old Mine Cut has a much higher crown and a deeper pavilion compared to the Round Brilliant cut. The proportions and depth of the Old Mine cut were optimized for the diamond to shimmer under candlelight, while the facets of the Round diamond were designed for maximum scintillation under electric light. In addition, the facets are larger, and rougher-cut than the ones in modern Round Brilliant diamonds, which creates more fire and more noticeable flashes of rainbow-colored brilliance.\nOld Mine Cut: the Antique Cushion Cut\nThe Cushion Cut is considered the contemporary version of the Old Mine Cut. They share the square-ish shape and the brilliant-cut facets. \u201cCushions are the modern diamond with the most variance in their faceting pattern, which harkens back to both Old European and Old Mine Cut since those were cut individually by hand and could vary drastically from stone to stone and cutter to cutter,\u201d says Grace Taylor, VRAI\u2019s Senior Director of Sales and Customer Experience.\nOld Mine Cut Diamonds and the 4Cs\nOld Mine cuts have larger facets that maximize fire, similar to the modern Cushion diamond. The large facets of this diamond shape, however, make both inclusions and colors more visible especially at higher carat weights. \u201cOld Mine Cuts are going to be less brilliant than modern diamonds because of the chunkier facets and higher crowns,\u201d warns Grace Taylor. \u201cThey work particularly well in warmer colors, because antique Old Mine Cuts just tended to have more visible warmth and we now associate that with vintage charm.\u201d\nBy today\u2019s standards diamonds might have a lower cut grade but that\u2019s not a defect of the stone itself. Old Mine diamonds were hand-cut and polished prior to the invention of refined mechanical tools, so they have a hand-cut feel that may look less precise and sharp than what we\u2019re used to in contemporary stone cutting.\nAre there lab-grown Old Mine Cut diamonds?\nLab grown diamonds cut in the Old Mine shape are quite hard to find, even though a thorough search can yield some results. They\u2019re often called \u201cOld Mine Cushion\u201d or \u201cAntique Cushion\u201d cut. In the case of VRAI created diamonds, Taylor recommends the Elongated Cushion shape. Each Elongated Cushion has different proportions and length-to-width ratios, coupled with the intense fire cast by the larger facets. All of these characteristics reproduce the hand-cut feel of Old Mine diamonds.\nWhat Is a VRAI Created Diamond?\nA VRAI created diamond is a lab grown diamond created in a zero-emissions foundry then cut and polished by master craftspeople. This means all VRAI created diamonds result from no mining, no human toll, no emissions. VRAI\u2019s lab created diamonds are chemically, physically, and optically identical to mined diamonds. This means you can get more carats for less.\nHow To Have A VRAI Created Diamond Cut for You\u2122\nWith VRAI\u2019s Cut for You\u2122 offering, you can have your very own center stone cut and polished to your exact specifications. Whether you\u2019re looking for a more timeless Cushion, a trending Elongated Cushion, or even a Moval \u2014 the perfect blend of a Marquise and Oval \u2014 at the center of your engagement ring, VRAI can create the unique Old Mine cut you\u2019re looking for in the carat weight of your choice.\nCreate Your Dream Ring With VRAI\nHave you been drawn to the romance of an Old Mine cut for years, or are you new to the style thanks to Taylor Swift\u2019s engagement ring from Travis Kelce?

But we did \u2014 we delivered.\u201d\nThat hustle paid off; about a month later, Swift embraced Kelce on camera after the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Baltimore Ravens to advance to the Super Bowl, giving the whole world a glimpse at her bespoke bauble.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a nod to them,\u201d Wove\u2019s lead jewelry consultant, Kendall Junck, tells us of the three letters Kelce chose to add to both bracelets, quipping, \u201cThey\u2019re such a dynamite couple.\u201d\nRelated Video\nAll the details on Taylor Swift's look from the Chiefs vs. Ravens playoff game\nCrafted from 14-karat yellow gold and studded with around 4.5 carats of lab-grown diamonds, Swift\u2019s bracelet retails for $6,360 and is part of Wove\u2019s collaboration with Michelle Wie West. And from the moment it launched, the pro golfer hoped to somehow get the piece onto the Grammy winner\u2019s wrist.\n\u201cWe were launching the Michelle Wie West collection back in November. Michelle and I were talking about the bracelet, and we were seeing it in person for the first time together, and she was just like, \u2018Oh my gosh, what if we could get Taylor to have this bracelet? Because I\u2019m friends with Travis,'\u201d Kendle recalls.\n\u201cAnd so she reached out to Travis, showed him that, hey, look, we have this really cool bracelet, and he said he would give it to her.\u201d\nWhile the actual order didn\u2019t come until right before the holidays, it\u2019s fitting that Kelce would pick a personalized friendship bracelet as a way to express his love; after all, the NFL great famously tried (and failed) to give Swift a version beaded with his phone number during her Eras Tour stop in Kansas City in July.\n\u201cAnd now, they\u2019re together and [wearing] diamond bracelets made with the same beads,\u201d Junck says. \u201cIt truly is full circle.\u201d\nAdding to the \u201ciconic\u201d factor of the moment, she notes, is the fact that Swift helped inspire the design even before Kelce came calling.\n\u201cOur inspo board was all different photos of bracelets I swapped on the subway to and from the Pittsburgh show, bracelets that [Michelle and her] daughter have made for fun at home. The friendship bracelet idea was very much inspired by the Eras Tour and by Taylor. So I think that\u2019s why it was such a great match for Travis,\u201d Junck explains.\nIt\u2019s also proven to be a great match for many other Swifties; in a matter of just a few days, her bracelet has become Wove\u2019s \u201cfull-blown hero product,\u201d per Kendle.\n\u201cIt has been incredible. Our followers have since doubled on our social platforms. We saw a 5,000 percent increase in website traffic. Sales are well into the six figures on this collection alone, and it\u2019s growing daily. We\u2019re super grateful for this moment,\u201d she tells us.\nOn Thursday night, Wove even dropped a \u201cmore accessible\u201d version of the design with a sterling silver paper clip-style chain, which starts at $290.\n\u201cOur site was about to crash,\u201d Kendle says of the ensuing demand for the lower-priced piece, a departure from the diamond dazzlers for which Wove is known. \u201cOur real bread and butter has always been engagement rings!\u201d\nSpeaking of which, should Kelce commission a custom sparkler from the company before popping the question, Junck has some ideas about what she\u2019d create.\n\u201cI could see her being a yellow gold girl, so probably something yellow gold. One hundred percent something bespoke; she\u2019s not getting just the simple solitaire \u2026 I could see her [going for] something more vintage-inspired, maybe Art Deco-y. Some ornate details on the piece, but nothing gaudy. And there are so many different eras you could go off of.\u201d\nKendle notes that Wove often makes engagement rings with \u201chidden stones,\u201d suggesting, \u201cShe could have little gemstones for every era, in different colors.\u201d\nAdds Junck, \u201cSomething in there, secret and hidden \u2014 whether it\u2019s an engraving or secret stones \u2014 would be a really sweet idea, because no photo would be able to get that. It\u2019d be just for her.\u201d\nFor more Page Six Style ..\n- See the best celebrity looks of the week in our new series, \u201cInstantly Iconic Style\u201d\n- Browse the best fashion and beauty products, according to celebs\n- Shop our exclusive merch\nUltimately, the jewelers are just overjoyed to have created a special moment for \u201cone of the most iconic couples of our generation,\u201d as Kendle puts it.\n\u201cTaylor and Travis are probably the most humble, normal celebrities out there \u2026 he just happens to be one of the greatest football players, and her one of the greatest singers.

      "text": "Taylor Swift's vast musical catalog has something for just about everyone, from fans of bops (Alexa, play 1989) to those who enjoy heart-wrenching ballads (See: Folklore, Evermore and The Tortured Poets Department). Every time Swift releases an album, fans know we're in for a rollercoaster ride of powerful emotion, strong storytelling and revealing personal narrative.\nOn the heels of her latest album release, The Tortured Poets Department, we Swifties have been busy decoding and absorbing lyrics from a whopping 31 songs poignantly chronicling heartbreak, grief, love and trauma. In addition to new album drops, fans now also look forward to rereleases of the singer-songwriter's first six albums, which include never-before-released \"From the Vault\" songs.\nSee also: The Complete Guide to Taylor Swift's New 'Tortured Poets' Double Album, by Fans for Fans\nHere are some of my all-time favorite lyrics Swift has written. This doesn't include every great line she's ever penned (otherwise this list would be much, much longer). Rather, they're lyrics I've often reflected on and discussed with fellow fans, and have found deep personal meaning in.\nThe tearjerkers\n\"You can plan for a change in the weather and time, but I never planned on you changing your mind.\" (Last Kiss)\n-- A poetic way of describing unforeseen heartbreak.\n\"You call me up again just to break me like a promise, so casually cruel in the name of being honest.\" (All Too Well)\n-- I could quote this entire song because it's a lyrical masterpiece. But I'm trying to be selective.\n\"And you say I abandoned the ship, but I was going down with it, my white knuckle dying grip, holding tight to your quiet resentment.\" (So Long, London)\n-- At a certain point, you've just got to let go.\n\"You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love, the slowest way is never loving them enough.\" (High Infidelity)\n-- Emotional pain can be the most lethal.\n\"You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath.\" (All Too Well, 10 Minute Version)\n-- This line succinctly illustrates the very different way two people can view the same relationship: One as something sacred and cherished, the other as something to keep hidden and downplay. That distinction can make all the difference.\n\"If I'm dead to you why are you at the wake, cursing my name, wishing I stayed?\" (My Tears Ricochet)\n-- Chilling, haunting lyrics. It's what Swift does best.\n\"And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts, memories feel like weapons.\" (Would've, Could've, Should've)\n-- There are some moments that will always haunt you, no matter how much time passes.\n\"I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere. Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here.\" (This is Me Trying)\n-- This is a relatable sentiment for anyone who has high ambitions but feels like they just can't make them a reality, or who finds themselves drawing comparisons to others.\n\"What we thought was for all time was momentary, still alive, killing time at the cemetery, never quite buried.\" (Loml)\n-- Some things, you expect to live forever.\n\"You come away with a great little story of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you.\" (Cold As You)\n-- From the earliest days of her career, Miss Swift knew how to nail a tearjerker.\n\"Criticize the way you fly when you're soaring through the sky, shoot you down and then they sigh and say, \"She looks like she's been through it.\" (Nothing New)\n-- This From the Vault track from Red is a chilling look into the anxiety Swift felt at this point in her career, and feels like an ominous foreshadowing of the media target she'd truly become in the coming years.\n\"I rewind th\u0435 tape but all it does is pause on th\u0435 very moment all was lost.\" (Evermore)\n-- It can be difficult to overcome the moment everything fell apart and we find ourselves replaying that pain over and over, rather than seeing the bigger picture and the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\"There'll be happiness after you, but there was happiness because of you. Both of these things can be true.\" (Happiness)\n-- A truly accurate characterization of both the optimism and struggle of getting over someone.\n\"You taught me about your past thinking your future was me.\" (All Too Well)\n-- OK sorry, I couldn't help it -- one more from All Too Well. This is one of my all-time favorite lyrics. In just a few words, it sums up the fallen dreams of doomed love.\n\"Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep, before the monsters caught up to you?\" (Innocent)\n-- A tragic ode to innocence and youth.\n\"Who could ever leave me, darling, but who could stay?\" (Archer)\n-- Swift poignantly depicts the dichotomy between feeling worthy of love and questioning that very right.\n\"You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing.\" (The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived)\n-- Even after the \"show\" is over, some people may not demonstrate who they really are.\n\"You had a speech, you're speechless. Love slipped beyond your reaches.\" (Champagne Problems)\n-- Oh, how quickly things can change and render our dreams useless.\n\"You're not my homeland anymore, so what am I defending now?\" (Exile)\n-- Cold, sharp lyrics to convey the struggle of coping with detrimental loss.\n\"I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush.\" (Gold Rush)\n-- How does one come up with a line this poetic?\n\"You swore that you loved me but where were the clues? I died on the altar waiting for the proof.\" (So Long, London)\n-- All talk and no action.\n\"Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it.\" (Clean)\n-- Truer words on lost love have never been spoken.\n\"Time is taking its sweet time erasing you, and you've got your demons and darling, they all look like me.\" (Sad Beautiful Tragic)\n-- Moving on and forgetting isn't always easy.\n\"I guess it's true that love was all you wanted, 'cause you're giving it away like it's extra change. Hoping it will end up in his pocket, but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain, oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay.\" (Tied Together With a Smile)\n-- Symbolism is something Swift has always done quite well.\n\"Take the words for what they are: a dwindling, mercurial high; a drug that only worked the first few hundred times.\" (Illicit Affairs)\n-- Ah, the fleeting, deceptive nature of ephemeral love.\n\"It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missing you.\" (Back to December)\n-- This is a deep, personal admission of making a grave mistake, which is never easy to own up to.\n\"If I can't relate to you anymore, then who am I related to?\" (Coney Island)\n-- It can be all too easy to become so consumed in a relationship that you feel lost when it ends.\n\"A greater woman has faith, but even statues crumble if they're made to wait.\" (The Prophecy)\n-- Patience can take its toll on anyone.\n\"Please don't ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere.\" (New Year's Day)\n-- This level of specificity is a vivid illustration of just how much she fears losing the love of her life.\n\"I hate to make this all about me, but who am I supposed to talk to? What am I supposed to do if there's no you?\" (Soon You'll Get Better)\n-- There's a reason this song gets Swift choked up.\n\"Old habits die screaming.\" (The Black Dog)\nIt's not so easy to move on.\n\"Only 20 minutes to sleep, but you dream of some epiphany.\" (Epiphany)\n-- This song, a moving tribute to health care workers during the pandemic, never fails to give me goosebumps.\n\"The old widow goes to the stone every day. But I don't, I just sit here and wait, grieving for the living.\" (Ivy)\n-- Loss comes in all forms.\nLove's a game, wanna play?\n\"'Cause you know I love the players and you love the game.\" (Blank Space)\n-- It takes two to tango.\n\"You paint me a blue sky and go back and turn it to rain. And I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day.\" (Dear John)\n-- Swift always does an incredible job of conveying the game-like nature of love. These lyrics are particularly heart-rending.\n\"You did a number on me, but honestly, baby, who's counting?\" (So it Goes...)\n-- I love when she gets all poetic like this.\n\"We never painted by the numbers, baby, but we were making it count.\" (The 1)\n-- Another fun instance of word play.\n\"It's poker, you can't see it in my face, but I'm about to play my ace.\" (New Romantics)\n-- Brilliantly clever.\n\"We are alone with our changing minds, we fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time.\" (State of Grace)\n-- That's pretty much how it goes.\n\"I love you, it's ruining my life.\" (Fortnight)\n-- Sometimes (unrequited) love can be quite an inconvenience.\n\"I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?\" (Cruel Summer)\n-- This epic track is filled with punchy lyrics, but this one takes the cake.\n\"Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress, we had this big wide city all to ourselves. We blocked the noise with the sound of, 'I need you,' And for the first time I had something to lose.\" (Holy Ground)\n-- The underlying fear of impending loss here is so tragically brilliant.\n\"Love is a ruthless game unless you play it good and right.\" (State of Grace)\n-- Another solid example of relating love to a game.\n\"There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair.\" (The Great War)\n-- There's nothing quite like the relief of calling a truce in a battle no one was going to win.\n\"Remind myself the more I gave, you'd want me less.\" (Now That We Don't Talk)\n-- Oh, that strange, inverse dynamic.\n\"I walked out, I said, I'm setting you free. But the monsters turned out to be just trees.\" (Out of the Woods)\n-- The illusion of fear is a tricky one to overcome.\n\"All we are is skin and bone trained to get along, forever going with the flow, but you're friction.\" (Treacherous)\n-- Swift poetically describes falling for someone she knows she shouldn't.\n\"Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves, chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us.\" (Afterglow)\n-- Here, Swift paints a clear picture of the fact that hurting someone you love will harm both parties.\n\"I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it.\" (Suburban Legends)\n-- Ah, that painful waiting game.\n\"You drew stars around my scars, but now I'm bleeding.\" (Cardigan)\n-- Healing isn't always permanent.\n\"So you were never a saint and I've loved in shades of wrong. We learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts.\" (State of Grace)\n-- Love isn't always picturesque, but it can still be beautiful. (Yes, I realize I've now quoted State of Grace three times but I can't help it.)\n\"Remember when I pulled up and said, 'Get in the car,' and then canceled my plans just in case you'd call, back when I was living for the hope of it all.\" (August)\n-- Many of us felt personally attacked by these lyrics about holding onto love that was never really ours.\n\"But I've seen this episode and still loved the show.\" (The Tortured Poets Department)\n-- That potentially slippery slope of allowing a (recurring) character flaw slide because you like the bigger picture.\n\"I broke his heart 'cause he was nice.\" (Midnight Rain)\n-- Welp, some actions just can't be justified.\n\"Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind, but I come back stronger than a '90s trend.\" (Willow)\n-- Taylor Swift, queen of the punchy metaphor.\n\"I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted.\" (Dancing With Our Hands Tied)\n-- This is what you signed up for.\nHaters gonna hate\n\"If a man talks shit then I owe him nothing.\" (I Did Something Bad)\n-- Preach.\n\"I could build a castle out of all the bricks they threw at me.\" (New Romantics)\n-- And they've thrown a lot of bricks.\n\"My castle crumbled overnight, I brought a knife to a gun fight, they took the crown but it's alright.\" (Call it What You Want)\n-- That castle she mentioned in New Romantics apparently wasn't built to last. But she has what she needs in the love of her life, no matter what everyone else is saying about her or doing, and that's true strength.\n\"I bury hatchets but I keep maps of where I put 'em.\" (End Game)\n-- Forgive, but don't forget.\n\"Band-aids don't fix bullet holes.\" (Bad Blood)\n-- Keep your fake apologies.\n\"Boys will be boys, then where are the wise men?\" (Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince)\n-- I wish I knew.\n\"I had a marvelous time ruining everything.\" (The Last Great American Dynasty)\n-- There's a high likelihood you've either made this your Instagram caption or thought about it.\n\"I'm so sick of running as fast as I can, wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man.\" (The Man)\n-- Same girl, same.\n\"I bet you couldn't believe when you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave.\" (I Bet You Think About Me)\n-- Through the pain, Swift penned this song with all the right levels of sass.\n\"A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground, with no one around to tweet it.\" (The Lakes)\n-- This is such vibrant imagery of regrowth following hostility, away from prying eyes and skeptics.\nLife lessons\n\"Never be so polit\u0435 you forget your power. Nev\u0435r wield such power you forget to be polite.\" (Marjorie)\n-- These are words to live by.\n\"Your nemeses will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing.\" (Long Story Short)\n-- Don't get too caught up in the little things.\n\"Everything you lose is a step you take.\" (You're On Your Own, Kid)\n-- An important reminder for when you've lost something you thought you couldn't live without. That push could be the thing that lands you exactly where you need to be.\n\"Love's never lost when perspective is earned.\" (Peter)\n-- Sometimes, you've gained something greater than what you've lost.\n\"Nothing safe is worth the drive.\" (Treacherous)\n-- Indeed.\n\"When you're young, you just run, but you come back to what you need.\" (This Love)\n-- Finding truth and purpose is everything, and it'll all come in time.\n\"Time, mystical time, cutting me open, then healing me fine.\" (Invisible String)\n-- Time really does heal all wounds, even the deepest ones. A grown-up Swift now knows that.\n\"Now I know why all the trees change in the fall, I know you were on my side even when I was wrong.\" (The Best Day)\n-- This line (and entire song, which is a heartwarming tribute to her mom) always makes me cry. It's a touching description of unconditional love.\n\"Don't you worry your pretty little mind, people throw rocks at things that shine.\" (Ours)\n-- Always deflecting the haters in the most poetic way.\nNow I see daylight\n\"I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you. I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you.\" (Daylight)\n-- That feeling of finding what you've been looking for is everything.\n\"All these people think love's for show, but I would die for you in secret.\" (Peace)\n-- A nod to the critics who say her relationships are simply for publicity, and an intimate declaration of genuine love.\n\"We bless the rains on Cornelia Street, memorize the creaks in the floor.\" (Cornelia Street)\n-- Beautiful detail is Swift's forte. This track is filled with them.\n\"I've never seen someone lit from within, blurring out my periphery.\" (Snow On The Beach)\n-- I love this imagery of someone being a pure source of light that illuminates your world.\n\"All my walls stood tall, painted blue, but I'll take 'em down, take 'em down, and open up the door for you.\" (Everything Has Changed)\n-- This vibrantly depicts the beauty and struggle of letting your guard down.\n\"I'm only up when you're not down, don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.\" (I'm Only Me When I'm With You)\n-- The truest allegiance.\n\"My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue, all's well that ends well to end up with you.\" (Lover)\n-- Pure poetry.\n\"Is this the end of all the endings?\" (King of My Heart)\n-- Finally, an optimistic outlook on a relationship that appears to be going well.\n\"He's got my past frozen behind glass, but I've got me.\" (It's Time to Go)\n-- The future is in no one's hands but her own."

It's been 'liked' more than 7 million times just minutes after it posted.\nThe bestselling pop star's connection to the Lions extends beyond her football-playing fianc\u00e9.\nIn a recently-posted episode of New Heights, the football-centric podcast hosted by Kelce and his brother Jason, Swift explained how her previous understanding of football involved Lions' quarterback Jared Goff and Buffalo Bills' quarterback Josh Allen facing off against each other during the same play.\nThe unexpected shoutout brought a lot of attention on Goff, who said he had a \"crazy couple of hours\" with his phone blowing up after the episode dropped.\nThe Lions have the third-hardest schedule among NFL teams in 2025, according to NFL analyst Warren Sharp, and their Week 6 trip to Kansas City is a big reason why. And though it might end up being one of the season's most-watched matchups, it may have a lot more to do with Swift than what the Lions bring to the table.\nYou can reach Christian at cromo@freepress.com"
