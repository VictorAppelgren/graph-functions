  "description": "President Donald Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook announced an upgraded investment plan.",
  "content": "Apple is now committing $600 billion to the U.S. economy over the next four years, up from the original $500 billion pledge earlier this year.\n\nAt a White House press event, Apple CEO Tim Cook, standing alongside President Donald Trump, revealed that American manufacturers are on track to produce 19 billion chips for Apple this year across 24 factories in 12 states, while committing to source only U.S.-made rare-earth magnets for its devices.\n\nToday, @Apple announced that it will invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years. pic.twitter.com/iDlkcqTKx2\n\nBelow is the full transcript of Tim Cook\u2019s remarks at the Oval Office:\n\nTim Cook:\n\n \u201cMr. President, thank you very much for having me here today. You\u2019ve been a great advocate for American innovation and manufacturing, and I\u2019m grateful for your leadership and your commitment.\n\nThat\u2019s a commitment we share at Apple because American innovation is central to everything we do.\n\nOur products are designed here, we\u2019re hiring and growing here, and we support 450,000 jobs with thousands of suppliers and partners in all 50 states.\n\nEarlier this year, we made our largest-ever spending commitment\u2014$500 billion to the U.S. over the next four years. That\u2019s already yielding results. Earlier this year, we broke ground on a new factory in Houston to make advanced AI servers. Just last month, the very first test unit rolled off that factory\u2019s line, proudly made in America.\n\nPresident Trump shared some kind words about that work, but he also asked us to think about what more we could commit to doing. And Mr. President, we took that challenge very seriously.\n\nI\u2019m glad to be here with you today, and I\u2019m very proud to say that today we\u2019re committing an additional $100 billion to the United States, bringing our total U.S. investment to $600 billion over the next four years.\n\nAs a part of this, we\u2019re launching Apple\u2019s American Manufacturing Program. It will drive even more production right here in America for critical components used in Apple products all around the world. And we\u2019re thrilled to announce that we\u2019ve already signed new agreements with 10 companies across America to do just that.\n\nFirst, with today\u2019s announcement, I\u2019m proud to say that Apple is leading the creation of an end-to-end silicon supply chain right here in America\u2014from design, to equipment, to wafer production, to fabrication, to packaging.\n\nIn Texas, we\u2019re working with manufacturers like Texas Instruments, GlobalWafers America, and Applied Materials. We\u2019re working with Amkor in Arizona, and Broadcom and GlobalFoundries in New York.\n\nThanks to President Trump\u2019s vision\u2014and with his help in his first term\u2014we also led the way to bring TSMC to Arizona by committing to be their first and largest customer. Today, they\u2019re producing tens of millions of chips for Apple using one of the most advanced process technologies in America today.\n\nWe\u2019re going to keep working with our suppliers to move even more of this incredibly advanced work to America. And this year alone, American manufacturers are on track to make 19 billion chips for Apple in 24 factories across 12 different states.\n\nSecond, we\u2019re committed to buying American-made advanced rare-earth magnets developed by MP Materials, which will become part of Apple\u2019s devices shipped around the world.\n\nMP is the only fully integrated rare-earth producer in the United States, and with this partnership, they\u2019ll be significantly expanding their flagship facility in Fort Worth, Texas. We\u2019re also thrilled to work together on a cutting-edge rare-earth recycling line in Mountain Pass, California.\n\nAnd third, in Kentucky, we\u2019ve worked with our partners at Corning to build the world\u2019s largest and most advanced smartphone glass production line. And I\u2019m pleased to announce that, very soon\u2014for the first time ever\u2014every single new iPhone and every single new Apple Watch sold anywhere in the world will contain cover glass made in Kentucky.\n\nIn addition to the American Manufacturing Program, we\u2019re also significantly growing our investments in AI, including expanding data center capacity in North Carolina, Nevada, Iowa, Arizona, and Oregon.\n\nWe\u2019re going to keep making investments right here in America. We\u2019re going to keep hiring in America. And we\u2019re going to keep building technologies at the heart of our products right here in America\u2014because we\u2019re a proud American company, and we believe deeply in the promise of this great nation.\n\nThank you all. And thank you, President Trump, for putting American innovation and American jobs front and center.\u201d",

      "text": "On Tuesday, former President Obama decided to weigh in on Texas Republicans\u2019 efforts to redistrict mid-decade, and he may have wanted to wait to hit send instead.\nAs The Gateway Pundit reported, President Trump urged Texas Governor Greg Abbott and the Texas State Legislature to create five additional Republican congressional seats to improve the GOP\u2019s chances of winning the midterms. Abbott and the Legislature obliged, but that was not the end of the story.\nAfter the map was approved by a House panel, Texas Democrats fled the state to block the Republicans in the legislature from holding a special session and to block a redistricting vote on Sunday. Illinois and New York are hosting the bulk of the fleebaggers.\nObama posted encouragement to the fleebaggers and urged his fellow Democrats to stay focused on the GOP\u2019s so-called \u2018power grab.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t lose focus on what matters \u2013 right now,\u201d Obama wrote on X. \u201cRepublicans in Texas are trying to gerrymander district lines to unfairly win five seats in next year\u2019s midterm elections.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a power grab that undermines our democracy.\u201d\nSocial media users promptly roasted Obama right after he posted this tweet, with many pointing out the fact that no state gerrymanders like his home state of Illinois.\nOthers mocked him over his rumored marriage problems and his role in the Russia Collusion Hoax.\n\u2014 Cernovich (@Cernovich) August 6, 2025\nY\u2019mean like this\u2026? pic.twitter.com/2rVeQI3RMi\n\u2014 VoteChecker (@VoteChecker) August 6, 2025\nAll of these people are going to prison for you. pic.twitter.com/QE6uOlZ0qe\n\u2014 Jammles (@jammles9) August 5, 2025\nLmfao!
