      "feedback": "The draft is strong on first‑principles and regime framing but not yet compliant with the exact 4-line Movers + 1–2 line Swing Trade format, and two of the Movers’ probabilities aren’t clearly anchored to evidence. Specifically, two Up/Down lines use 12–24 month horizons with regime weights (50% and 30%), but the other two lines carry 15% and 5% that aren’t directly supported by the sources, and the “Driver/Mechanism” and “What to watch” fields would benefit from tighter, thresholded triggers. The Ford Swing Trade is incomplete: the Long Ford line lacks Entry, Stop, Target, R/R, Invalidation, Trigger, and a clean 0–100 confidence/probability framing, and the analysis still drags in non‑Ford equities (NFLX) as movers. Actionable edits to reach world‑class quality\n\n- Restrict Movers to exactly 4 lines: 2 Up and 2 Down, each with the required fields. Ground probabilities strictly in the material’s regime weights: Up lines 50% (Regime A tilt) and 10–20% (a credible, clearly caveated share of the remaining Regime C possibility) and Down lines 30% (Regime B tilt) plus the remaining 10–20% allocated to a second Regime C outcome. If you keep two distinct horizons, ensure each line’s probability sums logically to the regime weights and annotate the reasoning with in‑text IDs (e.g., SGB2PAZGK; 65UUBU0OR) after the numbers.\n- Tighten each line’s content: Driver/Mechanism should be a crisp regime‑driven cause (e.g., EV profitability converging toward breakeven with ROIC > WACC; tariff/ policy channel translating into sustained capex efficiency). What to watch should specify numeric thresholds (e.g., “EV margin breakeven or positive; ROIC > WACC for two consecutive quarters”).\n- Rebuild the two lower‑probability lines so they are defensible: assign them to conditional states tied to regime C with explicit thresholds or remove them if no evidence supports those distinct lines; if kept, label them as conditional/scenario paths and attach 10%–20% probabilities drawn from the 20% Regime‑C residual, with IDs.\n- Replace the non‑Ford content: remove NFLX/NAS content from the Movers entirely; keep the Ford‑centric regime map, watchpoints, and price drivers for coherence. The “ANALYSIS DRAFT” should present only Ford‑driven movers for this section.\n- Convert the Swing Trade block into a proper one‑line (or two if needed) Swing Trade: Direction: Long; Horizon: 3–6 months; Entry: near current price; Stop: below a defined support, e.g., a specific price or moving average; Target: 6–9% upside; R/R: ~1.8x; Invalidation: ROIC fails to exceed WACC or EV losses widen; Trigger: ROIC > WACC for two consecutive quarters; Probability: 60%; Confidence: 70%. If you keep two Swing Trade lines, ensure both fit the 1–2 line limit and are not duplicative.\n- Ensure citation discipline: only include in‑text IDs after numbers or facts drawn from the sources, e.g., attach (65UUBU0OR)(SGB2PAZGK) to the measured EV margins/ROIC/Div yield figures and to regime weights; avoid trailing citation lists and keep density proportional to material‑anchored claims.\n- Scrub the prose for investment formatting: make each Movers line a single concise sentence or two short clauses; keep time windows, drivers, and watchpoints distinct and in the exact field order; ensure no filler adjectives or extraneous commentary.\n- After the rewrite, run a quick consistency check: lines strictly 4 (2 Up, 2 Down) with the required fields, Probabilities tied to the 50%/30% regime weights (and a clearly justified 10–20% residual), Ford‑centric, and a complete Swing Trade line(s) with numeric entry/exit parameters and a clear trigger/invalidation path. This will deliver a world‑class, first‑principles, scenario‑driven Swing Trade/Outlook aligned with the horizon/style and source constraints.",
