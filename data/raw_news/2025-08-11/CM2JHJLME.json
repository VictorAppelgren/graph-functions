  "description": "Tweak your new computer before using it!",
  "content": "Nearly all new Windows laptops come pre-installed with Windows 11. But with it, you also get a bunch of unnecessary features that can slow down your system, compromise your privacy, or bombard you with annoying notifications. That\u2019s why I tweak a few settings before I start using my new device.\n\nYour brand-new computer might feel fast at first, but it can slowly get sluggish if you don\u2019t turn off certain apps and services running in the background. These could be pre-installed programs from the manufacturer or unnecessary Windows services that eat up system resources. Disabling or even deleting them can help your computer run faster.\n\nTo stop these apps from slowing things down, click the Start button and open \"Task Manager.\" There, you can click on the top of the Memory, CPU, GPU, and Disk columns to sort and see which apps use the most resources. Before turning anything off or removing an app, research the process online to understand what the process entails.\n\nIf the process isn\u2019t tied to a core system function, it\u2019s safe to disable it. Right-click on it and select 'Disable'. If it\u2019s part of an app you don\u2019t need, uninstall the app.\n\nWindows comes with several visual effects, such as fading and sliding animations, shadows under windows, and smooth transitions when opening or closing apps. These make the interface look more polished and modern. But, they also put extra load on your CPU and GPU, which can slow down your system, especially on lower-end machines.\n\nFor this reason, I prefer to turn them off. To disable visual effects, right-click the Start menu and go to System > About. Then, click on \"Advanced System Settings.\" Under the \"Advanced\" tab, click the \"Settings\" button in the Performance section.\n\nIn the Performance Options window that opens, you can either choose \"Adjust for Best Performance\" to turn off all effects or select \"Custom\" to disable only the ones you don\u2019t want.\n\nGet Rid of Annoying Pop-Ups and Suggestions\n\nBy default, Windows shows pop-up notifications with tips, suggestions, and feature updates to help improve our experience. While these might occasionally be useful, I find them distracting. That\u2019s why I turn them off. It makes working on the PC less annoying, while also slightly speeding up the login process and reducing background activity.\n\nTo reduce annoying pop-ups and suggestions, right-click the Start button, open the \"Settings\" app, and navigate to System > Notifications. Then, scroll down and expand the \"Additional Settings\" section. Uncheck any options you don\u2019t find helpful. You\u2019ll also see a list of apps that can send notifications\u2014if any of them feel unnecessary or annoying, switch their toggle off.\n\nDid you know that Windows collects data about how you use your device, including your location, the apps you use, and your interaction with Windows services? While some features, such as location tracking, can be helpful for apps like Weather, Maps, or the Microsoft Store, others may feel intrusive.\n\nThat\u2019s why one of the first things I do when setting up a new computer is tweak the privacy settings. To reduce the amount of data sent to Microsoft, go to Settings > Privacy and Security > Diagnostics & Feedback and adjust the options to suit your preferences.\n\nNext, go to the \u201cGeneral\u201d tab and turn off the option that allows apps to use your advertising ID for personalized ads.\n\nYou should also review app permissions to manage access to your location, camera, microphone, contacts, and other sensitive data, and disable unnecessary permissions.\n\nWindows 10 and 11 come with a feature called Clipboard History, which saves everything you copy\u2014whether it\u2019s text, images, or links\u2014so you can easily access them later. While this feature can be helpful, it also comes with privacy concerns. If you share your device with others, they might be able to see sensitive information you've copied.\n\nThat\u2019s why I prefer to keep it turned off. To disable Clipboard History, right-click on the Start button and open the \"Settings\" app. Then, go to System > Clipboard, and switch off the toggle next to \"Clipboard history.\" This helps prevent your copied content from being stored on the device, but keep in mind that you\u2019ll lose the ability to access your clipboard history.\n\nAlternatively, you can keep the feature on for convenience while you're using your device, and then clear the clipboard history and disable this feature before handing it over to someone else.\n\nSetting up a new Windows PC is more than just creating an account and logging in. To keep your system running smoothly, protect your privacy, and cut down on annoying pop-ups and notifications, you\u2019ll need to adjust a few key settings. Making these changes improves my experience, and if you\u2019ve just bought a new device\u2014or plan to\u2014 consider doing the same.",

      "text": "Summary\n- Delete registry entries to remove leftover app data efficiently, but be cautious when making changes to the registry.\n- Manually remove leftover folders in common locations like Program Files and AppData.\n- Use the Disk Cleanup utility to clear the Temp folder of launch configurations and cached data.\nRemoving unneeded apps from your computer frees resources, but some don't do a good job of tidying after themselves when uninstalled. Here's how to remove any remnants they might have left behind.\nShould You Completely Remove Programs and Apps on Windows?\nIf you're going to install the program later on, you can leave the remnants of the removed app. That's because future installations of the program could use the data\u2014they don't have to start from scratch.\nHowever, if you won't use the uninstalled program again, you might as well ensure it's gone for good.\nAlternatively, if you uninstalled the app because it was problematic, and you want to reinstall it as a fix, the leftovers may cause problems. Sometimes, it's good to give an app a completely clean slate.\n1. Remove Registry Entries\nSome apps store the data they need in the registry, including settings and preferences or information about trial periods. When you uninstall the apps, they might not remove the information from the registry. That means you need to delete it manually.\nBe cautious when making changes to the registry; any mistakes could make Windows unusable. Before proceeding, back up the Windows registry or create a system restore. That way, you have a backup you can use to restore the registry if something goes wrong.\nPress Win + R to open Run. Then, type \"regedit\" in the text box and click \"OK\" to launch the Registry Editor. Head to the following key or copy and paste it into the address bar at the top:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\\nFind the key associated with the app you uninstalled, right-click it, and select \"Delete.\"\nClick \"Yes\" to confirm you want to delete the key. Study the keys carefully before deleting them because you don't want to delete the wrong one.\n2. Manually Remove Leftover Folders\nThere are several folders and directories where Windows places installed apps. That's where you should look if you want to find remnants of apps.\nPress Win + E to open File Explorer, navigate to \"This PC\", and open your installation drive (typically the C: drive). Then, look in the \"Program Files\" and \"Program Files (x86)\" folders.\nIf you find any leftover folders of the programs you uninstalled, delete them.\nNext, press Win + R to open Windows Run. Then, enter \"%appdata%\" in the text box and click \"OK.\"\nThis will open the \"Roaming\" subfolder in the \"AppData\" folder, where you can delete any unneeded folders and files.\nFinally, click the up arrow (on the left side of the address bar) to go to the \"AppData\" folder. Then, do the same clean-up in the \"Local\" and \"LocalLow\" folders.\n3. Delete Temp Files\nThe \"Temp\" folder is where Windows stores launch configurations and cached data from various apps. Windows deletes the data periodically, usually after a few days or when a certain threshold is met. But you can manually get rid of the data inside the folder yourself after uninstalling an app.\nTo do that, do a system search for \"Disk Cleanup\" and select it from the search results to launch the utility.\nSelect the drive where the program was removed from and click \"OK.\"\nIn Disk Cleanup, scroll down, tick the \"Temporary Files\" checkbox, and click \"OK.\" In the popup, click \"Delete Files\" to clear the temporary folder.\nYou can also manually delete the leftovers in the \"Temp\" folder itself. To do that, press Win + R to open Run. Then, enter \"%temp%\" in the text box and click \"OK.\" In the temp folder, delete any files associated with the program you uninstalled.\nRemoving up the remnants of removed apps not only keeps things tidy, it also has an added advantage of freeing up disk space."

      "text": "Quick Links\nWhile Windows notifications keep us informed, a constantly flashing screen filled with pop-ups can quickly become annoying. Thankfully, you don\u2019t have to deal with the distraction. Windows lets you manage and limit notifications to quiet the noise while staying updated on what truly matters.\n5 Turn Off All Notifications\nThere are moments when we want complete silence\u2014like when you're screen recording, focusing on deep work, giving a presentation, or gaming. During these times, the last thing you want is a distracting notification popping up. Fortunately, Windows allows you to mute all notifications to stay focused and avoid interruptions.\nTo turn off all notifications, open the Settings app, go to the \"System\" tab on the left, and go to \"Notifications.\" Then, toggle off the switch next to \"Notifications.\" This will disable alerts from all apps across your system. Just turn notifications back on once you're done so you don\u2019t miss any critical updates later.\nThis option may not be suitable for those who don\u2019t want to miss notifications from work-related apps. In such cases, you can manage notifications for individual apps instead.\n4 Mute Notifications From Selected Apps\nNot every app requires your constant attention. One of the easiest ways to minimize distractions is by disabling notifications from less important apps or games. By doing this, you\u2019ll continue to receive alerts for important things like messages, calendar events, or system updates\u2014while muting the noise from apps like Spotify, games, and similar non-essential programs.\nTo turn off notifications for specific apps, open the Settings app, go to the \"System\" tab on the left, and then navigate to \"Notifications\" on the right. You\u2019ll see a list of apps that are allowed to send notifications. Simply find the ones you don\u2019t need alerts from and toggle them off. You can always turn them back on whenever needed.\nFor important apps, you can click on their names to customize their notification behavior\u2014such as whether they can send alerts during \"Do Not Disturb,\" whether a sound plays and more.\n3 Enable Do Not Disturb Mode\nWindows offers a \"Do Not Disturb\" mode that, when activated, mutes all notifications, alerts, and pop-ups for a truly uninterrupted experience. Unlike the previous options, this mode allows you to receive notifications from specific apps, such as calls or reminders, without manually enabling or disabling notifications for individual apps.\nSimply turn on this mode, and you\u2019ll only get selected notifications. When you're ready to receive all notifications again, turn it off. To enable this feature, open the Settings app, go to the \"System\" tab, select \"Notifications,\" and toggle on \"Do Not Disturb.\" Here, you can customize which apps can send notifications while this mode is active from \"Set Priority Notifications.\"\nFor added convenience, you can also automate this mode to turn on during specific hours of the day. Go to \"Turn On Do Not Disturb Automatically\" and set the desired times.\n2 Stop Notifications From Appearing on the Lock Screen\nYou may have the habit of locking your screen when you step away from your computer in an office setting, but did you know that simply locking the screen doesn't fully protect your privacy? Some notifications, like emails, calendar events, or messages, can still appear on the lock screen, making sensitive information visible to others.\nTo improve your privacy or enjoy a cleaner lock screen without the ping of notifications when you step away, you can stop Windows from displaying them on the lock screen. To do so, go to Settings > System > Notifications. Then, expand the \"Notifications\" menu and uncheck the box beside \"Show Notifications on the Lock Screen.\"\nIf you don\u2019t want to turn off all notifications on the lock screen, you can turn them off for specific apps. Open an app settings and turn off the \"Hide Content When Notifications Are on Lock Screen\" option.\n1 Not a Fan of Notification Sounds? Mute Them\nUnless you've muted your device, you'll hear a sound whenever a notification arrives to alert you of updates. If you don't mind receiving notifications but find the sound disruptive, you can quickly turn off these notification sounds to help you stay focused. This way, you'll still see the notification visually but won\u2019t hear the notification ping.\nTo turn off sounds for all apps, open the Settings app, go to the \"System\" tab, and select \"Notifications.\" Expand the \"Notifications\" menu and uncheck the \"Allow Notifications to Play Sounds\" box.\nYou can also turn off notification sounds for specific apps. Open an app's settings and uncheck the \"Play a Sound When a Notification Arrives\" option.\nThe drawback of this setting is that if you step away from your device and don\u2019t hear the ping, you might miss the notification entirely until you manually check the notification center.\nConstant notifications can be distracting and clutter your screen, which can easily break your focus. Now that I\u2019ve walked you through how I filter out the noise and keep only the important alerts, you can customize your Windows notifications to suit your needs."

      "url": "http://www.howtogeek.com/ways-to-clear-the-clipboard-on-windows-11/",
      "text": "Quick Links\nYour clipboard saves the items you copy on your computer. This includes text, images, videos, and any other items. If you don\u2019t want someone pasting these items from your clipboard, you can clear all the clipboard contents. Here\u2019s how to do that on Windows 11.\nFrom the Clipboard History Menu\nIf you\u2019ve turned on Clipboard History, you can use the feature itself to wipe all the items on the clipboard.\nTo do that, press Windows+V on your keyboard. You\u2019ll see your clipboard and all the saved items on it. To clear these items, in the open window\u2019s top-right corner, click the \"Clear All\" button.\nIf you want to save something from your clipboard before wiping it off, do so before clicking Clear All. Selecting that button immediately erases everything stored on the clipboard.\nUse Settings to Wipe Off Clipboard Data\nUsing Settings is another way to clear the clipboard on Windows 11. To use this method, open Settings by pressing Windows+i. From the left sidebar, choose \"System.\" On the right pane, scroll down and select \"Clipboard.\"\nNext to Clear Clipboard Data, click \"Clear.\" Windows 11 will remove all the contents from the clipboard.\nRun a Command With Command Prompt to Delete Clipboard Data\nIf you like running commands or want to write a script that clears the clipboard, here\u2019s how to do that in Command Prompt.\nOpen Windows Search (press Windows+S), type Command Prompt, and launch the utility. On the CMD window, type the following command and press Enter:\necho off | clip\nWindows 11 will remove the clipboard items.\nOverwrite the Current Clipboard Item With PowerShell\nLike Command Prompt, PowerShell also allows you to wipe the clipboard with a command (called a cmdlet). To use it, open Windows Search (press Windows+S), type PowerShell, and launch the utility.\nOn the PowerShell window, type the following cmdlet and press Enter:\nSet-Clipboard -Value \" \"\nThis cmdlet replaces the clipboard content with a blank space.\nCreate a Desktop Shortcut That Clears the Clipboard\nIf you need to clear the clipboard contents often, you can create a desktop shortcut that does that for you. This is a quick and easy way to wipe off your copied data.\nTo make that desktop shortcut, access the Windows desktop by pressing Windows+D. Right-click anywhere blank on the desktop and choose New > Shortcut. On the Create Shortcut window, click the \"Type the Location of the Item\" field and type the following. Then, choose \"Next.\"\ncmd /c \"echo off | clip\"\nOn the following screen, click the \"Type a Name For This Shortcut\" field and type a name for your shortcut. This could be something like Clear Clipboard. Then, at the bottom, choose \"Finish.\"\nFrom now on, whenever you want to clear your clipboard contents, simply double-click your desktop shortcut.\nTo change the shortcut\u2019s icon so it\u2019s easier for you to find it, right-click the shortcut and choose \"Properties.\" Open the \"Shortcut\" tab and select \"Change Icon.\" Choose an icon on the list and click \"OK.\" To view more icons, click \"Browse\" and select \"shell32.dll.\" Then, pick an icon, choose \"OK,\" select \"Apply,\" and click \"OK.\"\nCopy a Random Piece of Text\nAnother way to prevent people from accessing your copied data is by copying a random item and letting it overwrite your actual data. You can copy a random piece of text, for example, and have this data be pasted when someone presses Ctrl+V instead of the previous data you had on the clipboard.\nTo do that, open a text editor like Notepad. Type any random text and copy it.\nThe next time you or someone pastes your clipboard content, this random text will be pasted.\nLog Out of Your User Account to Erase the Clipboard Contents\nWindows 11 clears your clipboard when you log out of your user account. Note that you\u2019ll have to enter your password when you log back in to your account.\nTo sign out of your account, open the Start Menu, select your profile icon, and choose \"Sign Out.\"\nRestart Your Windows 11 PC and Get a Clean Clipboard\nYou can turn off and back on your Windows 11 system to clear the clipboard contents. Make sure you\u2019ve saved your unsaved work in your apps before rebooting your computer.\nTo restart your PC, open the Start Menu, select the Power icon, and choose \"Restart.\"\nTip: Prevent Windows 11 From Saving Multiple Copied Items by Disabling Clipboard History\nWindows 11\u2019s Clipboard History feature saves multiple items that you copy on your computer. If you don\u2019t want that (and revert back to the clipboard only saving the most recent copied item), turn off the feature as follows.\nLaunch Settings by pressing Windows+i. From the left sidebar, choose \"System.\" On the right pane, select \"Clipboard.\" At the top, turn off the \"Clipboard History\" toggle.\nAnd that\u2019s how you wipe off the clipboard on your Windows 11 computer. Like this, there are other measures you can take to improve privacy on your Windows 11 PC."

      "text": "In today's world, data is currency, and it's being collected at every turn. Windows 11 is no exception, collecting diagnostic and location data, app usage, and more. As a privacy-conscious person, I'm always looking for ways to limit the amount of data I share. The good news is Windows does have features you can disable that will limit what is collected. These are the settings I always disable.\n6 Turn Off Your Advertising ID\nWindows Advertising ID tracks you across the apps and services you use to serve more relevant and targeted advertising. However, some see this as a way to turn your OS into an advertising platform.\nTo turn this feature off, go to the taskbar search and type settings. Now click the gear icon. From there, click Privacy & Security, then under the Windows Permission section, click General.\nYou'll see \"Let apps show me personalized ads by using my advertising ID.\" Toggle that slider to the off position.\nYou'll still get ads, but they will no longer be personalized. A small price to pay for a little more privacy.\n5 Disable Optional Diagnostic & Feedback Data\nWindows collects both required and optional diagnostic data that includes hardware specs, app usage and website activity. There isn't anything you can do regarding the required data, but there are several optional items you can turn off to ensure the minimum diagnostic data is being sent.\nGo to Settings, then click on Privacy & Security > Diagnostics & Feedback. From here you can toggle off the following choices:\n- Optional diagnostic data\n- Improve inking and typing\n- Typing and tailored experiences\nFrom this same menu, you can also delete any optional data Windows has already collected on this device.\n4 Turn Off Location Data\nWindows tracks your location to power Find my Device, which helps locate lost or stolen Windows devices, and location-aware apps, like weather and social media. If you don't want your PC to regularly share your location, you can disable this feature. Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location. Now, toggle the slider off.\n3 Update Your Installed App Permissions\nApps can be a big security and privacy risk, with access to your camera, microphone, location data, and your image and video files. Thankfully, Windows allows you to limit the app permissions in a couple of ways. To adjust permissions on a single app, go to Settings > Apps > Installed Apps.\nNow you'll see a list of the apps installed on your machine. To the right, you'll see three dots. Click on them to open the menu and click Advanced Options.\nIn this example, I've opened the Feedback Hub. You can see the list of permissions in the App permissions section. Toggle off the permissions you don't want to allow.\nNot every app you see in the list will offer \"advanced options\" or the ability to adjust permissions.\nAnother way to limit app permissions is via Settings > Privacy & Security > App Permissions. Click into a section, in this case, Microphone, and you'll see a list of the apps with access to this item. Toggle off the sliders on the appropriate apps and you're all set.\n2 Consider Using a Local Account\nMost people log in to their Windows device using a Microsoft account, which allows integration of Windows services like Office 365 and OneDrive, and syncs data and settings across all your Windows devices. These are compelling features, but privacy-centric people looking to restrict the data they share with Microsoft may prefer to use a local account.\nA local account is exactly that, local to the machine. It doesn't require an email or a password. To create a local account, go to Settings > Accounts > Other Users.\nOnce there click Add account.\nIn the dialog box that appears, click \"I don't have this person's sign-in information.\" On the next screen, click \"Add a user without a Microsoft account.\"\nNow you can create your local account by choosing a username. You can add a password but it's optional. Once you've done that, click Next.\nYou'll be taken back to the Other users section of settings and your new local account should show up in the list. After logging out and back in, you should see your local profile.\n1 Activity History\nThe Activity history feature tracks the applications you use, the files you open, and your browser history in Edge.\nTo disable this feature, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Activity History and toggle the slider to off.\nFor privacy-minded users, the options above highlight the best way to limit the amount of data that Microsoft collects.\nIf you'd like to go deeper, try logging into Microsoft's online privacy dashboard. There you can view, manage and delete the personal data that Microsoft collects while you're using their products or services."
