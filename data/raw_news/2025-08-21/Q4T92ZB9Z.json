  "description": "This disturbing display of female hatred played out not in some Middle Eastern or Indian hellhole \u2014 but in Washington state.",
  "content": "\u201cYou think I\u2019m a disgusting human being,\u2019\u2019 the teen girl cried out in court. \u201cWell, I think you\u2019re a disgusting monster!\u2019\u2019\n\nThe seething adolescent, known only as Fatima, stared into the face of her would-be killer: Her father.\n\nThe man who, in a fit of rage, was caught on camera last October strangling his own child in front of her high school, causing the youngster to suffer a seizure and pass out. She would have died had fellow students not saved her.\n\n\u201cHow can you call yourself a father?\u2019\u2019 continued her victim-impact statement that brought me to tears. \u201cYou tried to kill me, my dad tried to kill me with his own hands.\n\n\u201cDo you have no love for me?\u201d\n\nWhat had Fatima done to deserve such brutal punishment? She refused a marriage arranged by her abusive, controlling, despicable parents to a much older man overseas.\n\nAddressing the woman who gave her life, she spat, \u201cMy mom saw me almost pass away right in front of her own eyes and didn\u2019t help me at all, didn\u2019t see if I was OK . . . didn\u2019t even try to be there for me.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd here\u2019s the truly shocking part: This disturbing display of female hatred played out not in some Middle Eastern or Indian hellhole but in Washington state.\n\nIt was a suspected honor killing plot in which someone believed to have brought dishonor to her family, perhaps by dating non-Muslims, is sentenced to death, usually targeted for assassination by a male relative, often with her own mom\u2019s enthusiastic consent.\n\nIn this case, Fatima\u2019s vicious Iraqi-born parents, Ihsan and Zahraa Ali, got off easily. Acquitted of charges of attempted murder, the dad was convicted of assault and unlawful imprisonment and sentenced to 20 months behind bars.\n\nHer mother was nailed for violating a court order and sentenced to serve just under a year in stir.\n\nEven slaps on the wrists are a rarity, however. Many honor offenses go unreported and unpunished, those who follow these crimes say.\n\nIn recent years, as immigration has spiraled, honor killings have skyrocketed in the United States, experts contend.\n\nBut while these familial horrors exist among Hindus and Sikhs in India, honor killings stateside are committed almost exclusively by Muslims.\n\nIt is a disgrace that these crimes against our sisters and daughters are permitted to fester. But there exists no data base, no official count of how many girls and women in this country meet gruesome ends in the warped name of honor.\n\nStill, the FBI and other law-enforcement agencies turn a blind eye to this evil, keeping no solid statistics, providing little outreach, training, not even warnings to budding honor killers to back off.\n\nOne researcher puts the blame squarely on officials\u2019 terror of being branded as Islamophobic.\n\n\u201cIn America, there is such fearfulness of talking about Muslim-on-Muslim crimes,\u201d Dr. Phyllis Chesler, Ph.D, a New York City-based psychologist and author who\u2019s published several works about honor crimes, told me.\n\n\u201cMany of these honor-murdered girls refused to marry an unknown man from their fathers\u2019 country of origin (Egypt, Iraq, Pakistan) and were murdered in the USA. Most honor killing victims were seen as unacceptably too Western, too independent, too assimilated.\n\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be tolerated in the name of relativism, tolerance, anti-racism, diversity and political correctness,\u201d she said.\n\nThe only study I could find to address the subject from a law-enforcement standpoint was published by the US Department of Justice in 2015, quoting research estimating that between 23 and 27 honor killings were committed on US soil annually, about one every two weeks.\n\nThe United Nations Population Fund estimates the number of yearly deaths as 5,000 worldwide, but other agencies claim the death rate is more like 20,000. These numbers are widely considered grossly undercounted.\n\nOnly infrequently do these hidden offenses garner media attention.\n\nOn Jan. 1, 2008, beautiful, brilliant sisters Sarah Said, 17, and Amina Said, 18, were lured into the taxicab driven by their Egyptian-born father, Yaser Abdel Said, in the Dallas suburb of Irving, Texas, with the promise of going out to dinner. It was a sham.\n\nThe father pumped 11 gunshots into the backs of his daughters\u2019 heads, payback for resisting marriage to men in Egypt old enough to be their fathers.\n\nSarah\u2019s last words were recorded by a 911 dispatcher.\n\n\u201cOh my God. I\u2019m dying!\u201d she cried. The Said sisters\u2019 bodies were later found in their dad\u2019s cab.\n\nAfter spending 12 years on the FBI\u2019s 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list, Yasser Said, an American citizen, was finally apprehended in 2020, tried and convicted of double murder in 2022 and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nBut who will speak for the girls and women so savagely sentenced to death?\n\nAs long as authorities ignore this vicious practice, honor murders will continue to flourish.",

  "summary": "The article discusses the increasing number of honor killings committed in the US, largely committed by Muslims, as well as Hindus, Sikhs, Hindus, and Sikhs in India, while Muslims commit these crimes almost exclusively. The Department of Justice estimates that between 23 and 27 honor killings are committed annually in the United States, with a yearly death rate estimated at around 5,000 worldwide. However, there is no official count of how many girls and women in the country are murdered in the name of honor. The author argues that the FBI and other law-enforcement agencies turn a blind eye to this evil, providing little outreach, training, and even warnings to budding honor killers. Despite these crimes, as immigration increases, honor killings have increased in recent years.",
  "shortSummary": "The rise of honor killings in the United States highlights the widespread and often unreported crimes, despite widespread condemnation and calls for action against them to prevent their widespread prevalence.",

      "text": "Texas dad Yaser Said found guilty of fatally shooting teen daughters in \u2018honor killings\u2019\nA suburban Dallas man who evaded arrest for more than 12 years after being accused of fatally shooting his two teenage daughters in 2008 was convicted Tuesday in their killings.\nYaser Said, 65, was found guilty of capital murder in the deaths of 18-year-old Amina Said and 17-year-old Sarah Said. Prosecutors did not pursue the death penalty, meaning Yaser Said receives an automatic life sentence.\nProsecutor Lauren Black has said Said was \u201cobsessed with possession and control.\u201d\nThe sisters were found shot to death in a taxi parked near a hotel in the Dallas suburb of Irving on New Year\u2019s Day in 2008. Jurors heard a 911 call Sarah Said made by cellphone, telling the operator that her father had shot her and that she was dying.\nSarah Said was shot nine times and Amina Said was shot twice.\nA week before they were killed, the girls and their mother fled their home in the Dallas suburb of Lewisville and went to Oklahoma to escape Said. The sisters\u2019 boyfriends also joined them.\nThe prosecutor said the sisters had become \u201cvery scared for their lives,\u201d and decided to leave after their father \u201cput a gun to Amina\u2019s head and threatened to kill her.\u201d\nThe mother, Patricia Owens, who is divorced from Said, testified that he convinced her to return to Texas. she testified: \u201cI didn\u2019t think anything would happen.\u201d\nIn a letter written to the judge, Said wrote that he was not happy with his daughters\u2019 \u201cdating activity\u201d but he denied killing them.\nOn Monday, Said told jurors that he did not kill his daughters. He said he fled the taxi he was driving that evening because he thought they were being followed and someone wanted to kill him. He said he did not turn himself into authorities because he feared he would not get a fair trial.\nIn a Dec. 21, 2007, email that was brought into evidence, Amina Said told a teacher that she and her sister planned to run away. She said they didn\u2019t want to live by the culture of their father, who was born in Egypt, nor did they want arranged marriages, as he planned. Her father, she said, had \u201cmade our lives a nightmare.\u201d\n\u201cHe will, without any drama nor doubt, kill us,\u201d the email read.\nAfter the slayings, Said was sought on a capital murder warrant, and was placed on the FBI\u2019s most-wanted list. He was finally arrested in August 2020 in Justin, about 35 miles (60 kilometers) northwest of Dallas. His son, Islam Said, and his brother, Yassim Said, were subsequently convicted of helping him evade arrest."

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21.

      "text": "LA official is relieved Trump is doing what mayor and governor won\u2019t\nStop!\nLos Angeles is burning, devastated, brought to its knees by pro-immigration rioters fueled by unspeakable politicians bent on defending sexual criminals, drug traffickers and all manner of maniacs being detained and deported by agents of the US Immigration, Customs and Enforcement agency.\nBut not everyone in the state of California wants to see the once-glorious City of Angels destroyed by the mob, looted into poverty, burned to the ground as the Democratic mayor and governor cheer.\n\u201cI would like to publicly thank President Trump for sending the National Guard to save us in Los Angeles,\u2019\u2019 Ana Carril-Grumberg, elected to a neighborhood council in downtown LA, told me.\nSince this past weekend, she\u2019s witnessed fires raging out of control, violent clashes between protesters and cops, all while the mayor, governor and clueless members of the mainstream media denounce the president for his efforts to quell the mob and protect the citizenry \u2014 77,000 of whom call her district home.\n\u201cOnce again, like during the wildfires of January 2025, when Mayor Karen Bass chose to go to Ghana to party, she allowed our communities to burn. Today she once again proves total incompetence, and runs a deeply corrupt administration. She is a danger to our city and does not care at all about us,\u201d Carril-Grumberg said.\nShe had equally harsh words for California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\nEarth to demented leaders: Your people are suffering. So what do you do?\nIt\u2019s a specious claim that Trump is \u201ccreating\u2019\u2019 the very real fear and terror overtaking LA. Far from being \u201cmanufactured,\u2019\u2019 the crisis is real.\nIf the governor and others had simply done their jobs on behalf of the people of California, perhaps the city wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.\nAnd Ana Carril-Grumberg would not have to rely on the president of the United States to save her city."

      "text": "Sandy Cortez from the \u2018Burbs: a patronizing poseur\nI have something in common with the woman presently known as AOC: I started life in the Bronx.\nLike those of the socialist \u201cSquad\u201d member, my immigrant parents sought new life and opportunity on the fringes of this great city.\nAnd that is where the commonality begins and ends.\nWhen she was 5 years old, her family moved to a middle-class life in Westchester County, something she has attempted to hide with her suspicious origin story.\nThe lefty congresswoman claims to have helped her mother clean houses in the meager Bronx. Gone too was her childhood nickname, \u201cSandy.\u201d Ultimately, she went back to the more conveniently ethnic-sounding moniker, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\nAlexandria From the Block, she\u2019s not.\nMy folks moved to Queens. Sandy Cortez grew up in comfortable Yorktown Heights, I in a red-brick cooperative apartment building in unsnooty Bay Terrace.\nI have never worn a free designer gown, worth some $20,000, emblazoned with the slogan \u201cTax The Rich\u201d to the luxe 2021 Met Gala in pricey Manhattan, as the supposed Bronx badass did. There, she rubbed elbows with the A-list swells she pretends to despise.\nFor Sandy from the \u2018Burbs, poverty-stricken youth is a performative posture, an attempt to prove that the far-left Democratic darling is down with the little Bronx and Queens people she\u2019s elected to serve. But truth is, she fled from their company almost from the beginning.\nSo when she picked a social media fight with President Trump last week, calling for his impeachment over military strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, at one point snarking that females from the Bronx \u201ccan eat Queens boys for breakfast,\u201d she ought to take out her GPS.\nOr try a vegan diet.\nThe jig was up after New York state Assemblyman Matt Slater (R-Yorktown) shared AOC\u2019s Yorktown High School yearbook photo, prompting her to issue this tortured revision to her biography. For perhaps the first time, she publicly acknowledged setting foot north of New York City:\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of how I grew up and talk about it all the time,\u201d she posted to X on Friday. \u201cMy mom cleaned houses and I helped. We cleaned tutors\u2019 homes in exchange for SAT prep.\n\u201cGrowing up between the Bronx and Yorktown deeply shaped my views of inequality & it\u2019s a big reason I believe the things I do today!\u201d\nOnly people who grew up so privileged can take it all for granted. For Sandy Cortez and Zohran Mamdani, who also comes from a well-off background, it\u2019s all a front. Do they really speak for the downtrodden? Do they really know what they want?\nThe people of the Bronx want a hand up, not a handout, and certainly not the patronizing socialism of these poseurs."

      "text": "Video of suspected \u2018honor killing\u2019 plot resurfaces as parents stand trial for attempted murder\nThe trial for a Washington father and his wife accused of trying to kill their 17-year-old daughter in October 2024 is slated to begin Monday.\nIhsan Ali, 44, and his 40-year-old wife, the victim\u2019s mother, Zahraa Ali, are charged with second-degree attempted murder, second-degree attempted kidnapping, first-degree attempted kidnapping, and second-degree domestic violence assault in Thurston County.\nAdditionally, Ihsan Ali is charged with fourth-degree assault and Zahraa Ali is charged with violation of a domestic violence protective order and second-degree burglary.\nThe parents\u2019 alleged Oct. 18, 2024, attack on their own teenage daughter may have been a possible \u201chonor killing\u201d attempt, according to witness accounts detailed in court documents obtained by Fox News Digital.\nThe victim told police that her father was \u201ctrying to force her to go to another country, which had prompted her to run away earlier in the day.\u201d\nShe went to her former public school, Timberline High School in Lacey County, believing she could get help from adults there, and her father, mother and sister allegedly followed her to the school, an affidavit filed on Oct. 24, 2024, states.\nThe 17-year-old girl said a school counselor helped her find a room at \u201cSafe Haven,\u201d and her plan was to take a city bus from the school to get there. While waiting for the city bus, the victim\u2019s father allegedly approached her and \u201csaid she needed to go home,\u201d the affidavit states.\n\u201cHe would not take no for an answer and began pulling at her shirt. She said that once she was placed into a choke hold, she was unable to breathe or speak, and then passed out,\u201d the affidavit says, adding later that the victim believes she lost consciousness several times while her father allegedly choked her.\nVideo footage of the attack recently obtained by The Daily Mail shows part of the fight unfolding at the public bus stop.\nFox News Digital has reached out to the Alis\u2019 attorney, Erik Kaeding, for comment.\nMultiple witness accounts detailed in the affidavit say the victim\u2019s father approached and attacked the victim while the victim\u2019s 16-year-old boyfriend got between the two and tried to intervene. The victim\u2019s father allegedly punched the 16-year-old boy, who in turn began \u201cpunching Ishan [Ali] in the head to get him to let go of [the victim].\u201d\nWitnesses also described seeing the victim\u2019s eyes roll back while her father allegedly choked her, according to court documents.\nThe victim\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s mother later told police that she had been present once for a CPS interview with the 17-year-old victim in which she apparently stated that \u201cher father had recently been threatening her with honor killing for refusing an arranged marriage with an older man in another country.\u201d\nThe victim\u2019s boyfriend told police he believed the 17-year-old victim was \u201cgoing to die while her father was choking her out on the ground,\u201d the affidavit reads.\nThe victim also said she \u201cthought she was going to die\u201d and recalled her mother and sister \u201ctrying to grab hold of her\u201d during the incident.\nWhile the fight was underway, a bystander witness saw Ishan Ali put the girl in a chokehold \u201cand would not let go.\u201d He intervened \u201cand was eventually able to get the female to break away and detained Ishan for law enforcement as he was the primary aggressor,\u201d court documents read.\nThe boyfriend\u2019s father, Victor Barnes, previously told FOX 13 Seattle that he is glad his son \u201cwas there to save [the victim\u2019s] life\u201d but added that he needs \u201cmore explanation about why the adults were so careless.\u201d\nHe told the outlet an adult should have escorted the victim to the bus stop rather than his 16-year-old son.\n\u201cHigh school for me is a time I\u2019d never forget. It was probably some of the four funniest years of my life, and it\u2019s unfortunate he would have to experience something like this in high school,\u201d said Barnes.\nHe further told the outlet that he had to file a restraining order against the victim\u2019s parents because they kept showing up to his family\u2019s home looking for the victim prior to the assault, FOX 13 reported."

      "text": "Proving the old saw that a conservative is a liberal who\u2019s been mugged, one of the New York Times\u2019 marquee columnists has agreed \u2014 grudgingly, stubbornly, kicking and screaming \u2014 that President Trump is right: There\u2019s too much crime in the nation\u2019s capital.\nAnd, just possibly, Washington, DC, currently under Democratic control, could benefit from Trump calling in the National Guard and other feds to help restore law and order.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to drag F.B.I. agents from their desks to be cops on the beat. And the tableau of National Guard troops \u2014 even unarmed \u2014 raises the specter of martial law being normalized and weaponized,\u201d Pulitzer Prize-winning DC-based scribe Maureen Dowd wrote over the weekend.\nThen La Dowd suddenly hit the brakes, skidded, and did a complete 180.\n\u201cIt is also true that many D.C. residents are secretly glad to see more uniforms. No matter what statistics say, they don\u2019t feel safe.\u201d\nThis about-face was brought on by her sister\u2019s close encounter with slovenly car thieves. As Dowd tells it, she was having dinner with her sibling Peggy in the upscale Georgetown neighborhood recently when the metaphorical mugging zapped the liberal right out of her: Peg\u2019s beloved Buick vanished from its parking spot by Maureen\u2019s house.\n\u201cTwo polite officers who responded to our call said they could do little, amid a rash of brazen car thefts by teenagers,\u201d Dowd wrote.\n\u201cOne officer said that, even if they saw the perp driving in her car, they could not chase him, because of laws passed by the D.C. Council.\u201d\nDowd initially seemed to dismiss Trump\u2019s hard-core stance on juvenile crime as over-the-top payback against two 15-year-olds charged with assaulting and attempting to carjack a former Department of Government Efficiency employee. That is, until Peggy\u2019s Buick showed up in a park in nearby Maryland the morning after it was snatched \u2014 still running, nearly out of gas, with a $215 tow charge she was required to pay, Dowd griped.\nThere was a half-eaten pizza, grape soda cans, fast-food wrappers, a used condom and a pair of debit cards inside, Dowd reported. But cops said they could do nothing to nail the fiends.\nAdding insult to injury, Peggy soon received more than $1,800 worth of speed camera tickets for driving 70 miles an hour in a 25-mph zone, and had to prove the car was stolen in order to get the summonses tossed.\nDowd\u2019s co-workers haven\u2019t gotten the message. Last week, shortly after the president declared war on DC crime, the Times worked double-time to minimize the threat.\nOne article refuted Trump\u2019s statement that the 2023 murder rate was the highest \u201cprobably ever.\u201d False! crowed the paper. The homicide rate of about 40.4 deaths per 100,000 people was the highest in 26 years, not ever. And in 2024, that number dipped to some 26.6 corpses per 100,000 Washingtonians\nBut Dowd is not favorably impressed.\n\u201cWhile the district\u2019s homicide rate has fallen,\u201d she writes, \u201cit\u2019s almost as high as New York\u2019s at its most dangerous, in 1990.\u201d\nDowd, whose father was a cop, confesses she packs pepper spray these days to protect her from troublemakers when walking around town, a habit she adopted years ago when her mother drove her to her college dorm with a butcher knife on the seat between them. Her mom also gave her a Chinese letter opener with written instructions on how to find the jugular of an assailant.\nOver the weekend, Times reporters visited DC neighborhoods populated primarily with people of color to find out how residents felt about attempts to wipe out crime. Perhaps surprisingly to the Times, not everyone in these communities opposes being safer. Though every attempt was made to find people who said they did not trust the president, others admitted liking continuing breathing.\nDowd summed things up, writing, \u201cBut progressives should not fall into Trump\u2019s trap and play down crime, once more getting on the wrong side of an inflammatory issue. As with inflation, they should remember that personal experiences can count more than sanguine statistics.\n\u201cEven if Trump is being diabolical, Democrats should not pretend everything is fine here. Because it\u2019s not.\u201d\nFinally \u2014 all the news that\u2019s fit to print."
