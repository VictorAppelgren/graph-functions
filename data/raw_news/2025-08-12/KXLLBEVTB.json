  "description": "The country's largest private prison companies are reporting significant profits amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.",
  "content": "The country's largest private prison companies are reporting significant profits amid an aggressive push by the Trump administration to increase immigration arrests and detentions.\n\nDuring earnings calls last week, executives with the firms Geo Group and CoreCivic announced an increase in revenue from new and current contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and discussed their plans to expand their businesses to meet the administration's demands.\n\n\"Our business is perfectly aligned with the demands of this moment,\" said CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger. \"We are in an unprecedented environment with rapid increases in federal detention populations nationwide and a continuing need for solutions.\"\n\nCoreCivic reported a total revenue of $538.2 million during their second quarter, a 9.8% increase from the same quarter in 2024.\n\nDuring the call, Hininger told investors the company is evaluating additional opportunities for expansion and said that CoreCivic facilities are \"the most humane, most efficient logistically, have the highest audit compliance scores in their system, and are more secure [and] weatherproof.\"\n\nHininger said that while ICE has recently been using \"soft-sided solutions\" like the tent facilities at Guantanamo Bay and at Florida's \"Alligator Alcatraz\" detention center, he believes the agency \"does not see soft-sided facilities as long-term solutions.\"\n\n\"In the days since the election, the message has been pretty darn clear from the administration, DHS leadership, and ICE leadership that detention is going to be the priority,\" Hininger said, adding that the company has been \"working around the clock\" to open up bed space and new detention facilities.\n\nGeo Group, ICE's largest contractor, reported total second-quarter revenue of $636.2 million, a 5% increase from the second quarter of 2024.\n\nDuring their earnings call last week, Geo Group Chairman George Zoley said the utilization of their current ICE contracts increased from 15,000 beds to 20,000 beds, which Zoley said is the highest level of ICE utilization in the company's history.\n\n\"All of these efforts are aimed at placing our company in the best competitive position possible to pursue what we continue to believe are unprecedented growth opportunities as a long-standing support services provider for ICE,\" said Zoley.\n\n\"We believe we are uniquely positioned to assist the agency to meet its objectives,\" Zoley said.\n\nThe Geo Group CEO told investors that \"given the size\" of the undocumented immigrant population in the U.S., the company's view is that in addition to increased detention capacity, the \"enforcement of federal immigration laws\" could lead to an increase in GPS tracking for individuals.\n\nThe company, which has contracted with ICE for over 20 years to manage the agency's electronic monitoring program, currently tracks approximately 183,000 individuals, Zoley said. The tracking program is run by BI Inc., a subsidiary of Geo Group.\n\n\"Once detention capacity is maximized by the end of the year, we speculate that the focus will likely shift to increasing the use of GPS tracking,\" Zoley said. \"We believe we've taken the necessary resources to significantly and quickly respond to the eventual expansion of [the] Intensive Supervision and Appearance Program (ISAP).\"\n\nICE has for years relied on private companies to house detained migrants, making it a multimillion-dollar business.\n\nAs ABC News has previously reported, Geo Group and CoreCivic --- both of whose leadership have long supported Trump --- saw their stock prices immediately spike after Trump's victory in the November election.",

There are 2,700 personnel in the D.C. National Guard.\nThe expectation is that if guardsmen are activated, it would be in a support role to local authorities.\nThe D.C. National Guard is unique in that, unlike other National Guards, it is not under the control of a governor or, in this case, the mayor of D.C., but the president.\nThat authority has been delegated to the defense secretary and the secretary of the Army.\n-ABC News\u2019 Luis Martinez\nAug 10, 2025, 3:40 PM EDT\nVance denies meeting at his residence on Epstein\nVice President JD Vance dismissed reports that a meeting took place at his residence with top administration officials Thursday that involved discussions about convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\"There was no meeting at my house last night. There just wasn't,\" Vance told Fox News\u2019 Maria Bartiromo in an interview that aired on \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\"We did meet at the White House yesterday, but not at the time that they said that they -- that we were going to meet and not about the subject that we -- they said that we were going to meet about,\" Vance said in the interview that was taped on Friday.\n\"We actually didn't talk about the Epstein issue at all. That was never meant to be the subject of the meeting,\" he continued.\nVance said the reports came from someone leaking a calendar entry in which they assumed that it was about Epstein.\nVance reiterated that Trump has called for full transparency, and efforts are underway to compile documents.\n\"On the Epstein issue, what the president has said very clearly, because we have had other meetings about that, is that he wants us to be fully transparent and he wants the credible information out there. So, we're working to compile the thousands and thousands of documents that are out there for full transparency,\" Vance said.\nVance said he supported the decision by Rep. James Comer, chair of the House Oversight Committee, to subpoena Bill and Hillary Clinton in its investigation of the Epstein files.\n-ABC News\u2019 Kelsey Walsh\nAug 10, 2025, 3:37 PM EDT\nTrump to hold Monday news conference on DC crime\nTrump announced on his social media platform that he\u2019ll hold a news conference at 10 a.m. Monday to discuss crime in Washington, D.C.\nThe president said that he has given D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser an opportunity to reduce crime rates but crime has gotten worse.\n\"The Mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, is a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances, and the Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive. The American Public is not going to put up with it any longer,\" Trump said in his post.\nContrary to the president's claim, Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s preliminary year-to-date crime rate comparison shows that crime in D.C. has decreased by 7% since last year, with violent crime down 26% and property crime reduced by 5%.\n\u201cI will take care of our cherished Capital, and we will make it, truly, GREAT AGAIN! Before the tents, squalor, filth, and Crime, it was the most beautiful Capital in the World. It will soon be that again,\u201d Trump wrote.\n-ABC News\u2019 Kelsey Walsh\nAug 10, 2025, 1:35 PM EDT\nVance brushes off talk of 2028 ticket\nAfter Trump publicly suggested a Vance-Rubio ticket for 2028, the vice president shot down continued dialogue during an interview with Fox News\u2019 Maria Bartiromo, saying that Rubio and he are not focused on politics right now.\n\"I saw Marco about a month ago. We just laughed at the whole thing, because neither one of us are focused on politics. We're focused on actually doing a good job for the American people,\" Vance said in the interview that aired on \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\"If we do a good job, number one, that's the reward, in and of itself, that I will have made a big difference in the lives of our country for the last six months, the next 3.5 years. But if we do a good job, the politics will take care of itself,\" he continued.\nDespite Vance trying to navigate away from the topic, he did not dismiss the possibility of running for president in 2028 when asked.\n\"I'm not going to break that news today, Maria,\" he said. \"What I'm going to do is focus for the next year and a half on doing a really good job for the American people, winning the midterm elections in 2026. Then we can talk about politics after that.\""

      "text": "Supreme Court formally asked to overturn landmark same-sex marriage ruling\nKim Davis, a former clerk who refused gay couples, brought the appeal.\nTen years after the Supreme Court extended marriage rights to same-sex couples nationwide, the justices this fall will consider for the first time whether to take up a case that explicitly asks them to overturn that decision.\nKim Davis, the former Kentucky county clerk who was jailed for six days in 2015 after refusing to issue marriage licenses to a gay couple on religious grounds, is appealing a $100,000 jury verdict for emotional damages plus $260,000 for attorneys fees.\nIn a petition for writ of certiorari filed last month, Davis argues First Amendment protection for free exercise of religion immunizes her from personal liability for the denial of marriage licenses.\nMore fundamentally, she claims the high court's decision in Obergefell v Hodges -- extending marriage rights for same-sex couples under the 14th Amendment's due process protections -- was \"egregiously wrong.\"\n\"The mistake must be corrected,\" wrote Davis' attorney Mathew Staver in the petition. He calls Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion in Obergefell \"legal fiction.\"\nThe petition appears to mark the first time since 2015 that the court has been formally asked to overturn the landmark marriage decision. Davis is seen as one of the only Americans currently with legal standing to bring a challenge to the precedent.\n\"If there ever was a case of exceptional importance,\" Staver wrote, \"the first individual in the Republic's history who was jailed for following her religious convictions regarding the historic definition of marriage, this should be it.\"\nLower courts have dismissed Davis' claims and most legal experts consider her bid a long shot. A federal appeals court panel concluded earlier this year that the former clerk \"cannot raise the First Amendment as a defense because she is being held liable for state action, which the First Amendment does not protect.\"\nDavis, as the Rowan County Clerk in 2015, was the sole authority tasked with issuing marriage licenses on behalf of the government under state law.\n\"Not a single judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals showed any interest in Davis's rehearing petition, and we are confident the Supreme Court will likewise agree that Davis's arguments do not merit further attention,\" said William Powell, attorney for David Ermold and David Moore, the now-married Kentucky couple that sued Davis for damages, in a statement to ABC News.\nA renewed campaign to reverse legal precedent\nDavis' appeal to the Supreme Court comes as conservative opponents of marriage rights for same-sex couples pursue a renewed campaign to reverse legal precedent and allow each state to set its own policy.\nAt the time Obergefell was decided in 2015, 35 states had statutory or constitutional bans on same-sex marriages, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Only eight states had enacted laws explicitly allowing the unions.\nSo far in 2025, at least nine states have either introduced legislation aimed at blocking new marriage licenses for LGBTQ people or passed resolutions urging the Supreme Court to reverse Obergefell at the earliest opportunity, according to the advocacy group Lambda Legal.\nIn June, the Southern Baptist Convention -- the nation's largest Protestant Christian denomination -- overwhelmingly voted to make \"overturning of laws and court rulings, including Obergefell v. Hodges, that defy God's design for marriage and family\" a top priority.\nSupport for equal marriage rights softening\nWhile a strong majority of Americans favor equal marriage rights, support appears to have softened in recent years, according to Gallup -- 60% of Americans supported same-sex marriages in 2015, rising to 70% support in 2025, but that level has plateaued since 2020.\nAmong Republicans, support has notably dipped over the past decade, down from 55% in 2021 to 41% this year, Gallup found.\nDavis' petition argues the issue of marriage should be treated the same way the court handled the issue of abortion in its 2022 decision to overturn Roe v Wade. She zeroes in on Justice Clarence Thomas' concurrence in that case, in which he explicitly called for revisiting Obergefell.\nThe justices \"should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,\" Thomas wrote at the time, referring to the landmark decisions dealing with a fundamental right to privacy, due process and equal protection rights.\n\"It is hard to say where things will go, but this will be a long slog considering how popular same-sex marriage is now,\" said Josh Blackman, a prominent conservative constitutional scholar and professor at South Texas College of Law.\nBlackman predicts many members of the Supreme Court's conservative majority would want prospective challenges to Obergefell to percolate in lower courts before revisiting the debate.\nThe court is expected to formally consider Davis' petition this fall during a private conference when the justices discuss which cases to add to their docket. If the case is accepted, it would likely be scheduled for oral argument next spring and decided by the end of June 2026. The court could also decline the case, allowing a lower court ruling to stand and avoid entirely the request to revisit Obergefell.\n\"Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett seem wildly uninterested. Maybe Justice Neil Gorsuch, too,\" said Sarah Isgur, an ABC News legal analyst and host of the legal podcast Advisory Opinions.\n\"There is no world in which the court takes the case as a straight gay marriage case,\" Isgur added. \"It would have to come up as a lower court holding that Obergefell binds judges to accept some other kind of non-traditional marital arrangement.\"\nRuling wouldn't invalidate existing marriages\nIf the ruling were to be overturned at some point in the future, it would not invalidate marriages already performed, legal experts have pointed out. The 2022 Respect for Marriage Act requires the federal government and all states to recognize legal marriages of same-sex and interracial couples performed in any state -- even if there is a future change in the law.\nDavis first appealed the Supreme Court in 2019 seeking to have the damages suit against her tossed out, but her petition was rejected. Conservative Justices Thomas and Samuel Alito concurred with the decision at the time.\n\"This petition implicates important questions about the scope of our decision in Obergefell, but it does not cleanly present them,\" Thomas wrote in a statement.\nMany LGBTQ advocates say they are apprehensive about the shifting legal and political landscape around marriage rights.\nThere are an estimated 823,000 married same-sex couples in the U.S., including 591,000 that wed after the Supreme Court decision in June 2015, according to the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School. Nearly one in five of those married couples is parenting a child under 18.\nSince the Obergefell decision, the makeup of the Supreme Court has shifted rightward, now including three appointees of President Donald Trump and a 6-justice conservative supermajority.\nChief Justice John Roberts, among the current members of the court who dissented in Obergefell a decade ago, sharply criticized the ruling at the time as \"an act of will, not legal judgment\" with \"no basis in the Constitution.\" He also warned then that it \"creates serious questions about religious liberty.\"\nDavis invoked Roberts' words in her petition to the high court, hopeful that at least four justices will vote to accept her case and hear arguments next year."

      "text": "In Trump's mass deportation plan, the private prison industry sees a lucrative opportunity\nAn executive said the plan could mean a \"potential sea change\" for the industry.\nAs the government and law enforcement brace for the sweeping ramifications of President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to deport what could be millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States, another stakeholder appears poised to cash in on the complex logistics that would be required: the powerful private prison industry.\nOn corporate earnings calls since Election Day, executives at the country's top private prison firms have embraced Trump's immigration agenda as a potential windfall if the federal government requires contractors to construct new detention facilities and provide additional support services for the unprecedented effort.\nGeo Group founder George Zoley, whose company is the country's largest private prison operator, told investors last week that Trump's deportation plans represent a \"potential sea change\" for the industry.\n\"The Geo Group was built for this unique moment in our history and the opportunities that it will bring,\" Zoley said.\nThe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) has for years relied on private companies to house detained migrants, making it a multimillion-dollar business. That industry is expected to grow under Trump and his newly tapped border czar, Tom Homan, who has embraced Trump's promise to undertake mass deportations on \"Day 1\" of the new administration.\nJohn Sandweg, a former acting director of ICE, said he expects the Trump administration to offer \"massive contracts\" to the major players in the private prison industry.\n\"[Trump] is going to rely heavily on them,\" Sandweg told ABC News. \"Those private contractors are going to make billions, legitimate billions off this.\"\nThe two largest private prison companies -- Geo Group and CoreCivic -- saw their stocks surge after the election last week.\nUnder the first Trump administration, the number of immigrants detained in private detention facilities grew to a record high, according to a 2019 report from the Sentencing Project, a group that advocates for humane treatment of prisoners.\n\"The Trump administration's immigration policies, as well as existing immigration legislation, create structural incentives to increase detention, which has largely been achieved through the use of private prisons,\" the report said.\nFor years, many Democratic lawmakers have called for an end to the federal government's use of private prisons due to what they say is inadequate oversight in private facilities that results in underreported health and safety violations. In a letter sent to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in May, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats urged Mayorkas to phase out ICE's use of private detention after President Joe Biden sought to phase out the use of private prisons at the federal level.\n\"Upon termination of contracts, ICE should pursue community-based alternatives to detention, which provide immigrants with resources that help them integrate into their communities and stay with their families,\" the letter said.\nEunice Cho, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project told ABC News in a statement that ICE opened up 40 new detention facilities during the Trump administration, with the majority of beds -- over 90% -- going to private prison companies.\n\"There is little doubt that private prison companies will profit handsomely under the Trump administration and its attacks against immigrant communities,\" Cho said. \"The true cost, however, will be borne by people who will be locked up in dangerous, deadly, and inhumane immigrant detention centers, where private prison companies are accountable to one thing: the bottom line.\"\nHoman, himself a former ICE director, has fiercely defended the use of private facilities to house ICE detainees, arguing they allow \"higher quality and lower cost than the government can provide.\"\n\"Using outside contractors that run facilities like this as their core business function saves millions of dollars in taxpayer funds and increases the quality of care those being detained receive,\" Homan wrote in his 2020 book, \"Defend the Border and Save Lives.\"\nHoman has framed the use of private facilities as a legal necessity because ICE is legally required to detain most of the undocumented immigrants they arrest -- and most states lack enough government-run facilities to house them. Even if states pass laws prohibiting the use of private prisons, Homan said ICE would continue the use of the private facilities.\nOn Geo Group's earnings call last week, Zoley and other executives said they have the \"necessary technology and staffing resources to significantly scale up the delivery\" of services if needed. The company already has thousands of unused beds available, including 10,000 beds at six company facilities and 8,000 beds at existing ICE and U.S. Marshals facilities that are already under contract.\nExecutives from CoreCivic said during a recent earnings call that they were already taking steps to make additional beds available in anticipation of the need once Trump is sworn into office.\n\"It feels like with the election this year, we're heading into an era that we really haven't seen,\" said one CoreCivic executive."

The \"horrific\" assault occurred about a half mile into the park, with the husband attacked first, police said.\nThe children, ages 7 and 9, were not harmed in the incident thanks to the actions of their mother, police said.\n\"We believe that the mother took them to safety, and then returned to help her husband,\" Maj. Stacie Rhoads with the Arkansas State Police said during a press briefing Thursday.\nFollowing a dayslong manhunt for the suspect, McGann was arrested shortly before 5 p.m. local time Wednesday at a barbershop in Springdale, about 30 miles north of the park, police said.\nDuring an interview with police, he admitted to killing the couple, Arkansas State Police Director Col. Mike Hagar said during Thursday's press briefing.\nDNA from blood recovered from the crime scene also matched McGann's DNA, Hagar said. The suspect had sustained cuts on his hands during a struggle with the victims, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation.\nItems recovered from his residence were \"consistent with being involved in this particular crime,\" Hagar said.\nMcGann had recently moved to the area from Oklahoma and had been hired to work at a local school, officials said.\nHe was hired to teach in the Springdale Public Schools district this upcoming school year but had not yet begun employment, according to the district's superintendent, Jared Cleveland.\n\"This individual has not at any time come into contact with Springdale students or the families we serve,\" Cleveland said in a statement, adding that no additional information is available at this time due to the ongoing investigation.\n\"Our entire team extends our deepest condolences to the Brink family. Their children are especially in our thoughts and prayers,\" he said.\nMcGann was a fifth grade teacher in Broken Arrows, Oklahoma, during the 2023-2024 school year, the school district said. He passed required background checks, a Broken Arrow Public Schools spokesperson said.\nThe prior school year, he was employed at an elementary school in Flower Mound, Texas, the Lewisville Independent School District confirmed. He was placed on administrative leave in the spring of 2023 \"following concerns related to classroom management, professional judgment, and student favoritism,\" and he ultimately resigned, the school district said.\n\"An internal investigation found no evidence of inappropriate behavior with students,\" the school district added.\nAsked about a motive in the double homicide, Hagar said it remains under investigation, though he did say it appeared to be a \"completely random event.\"\n\"We have no reason to believe that there was any known association between our suspects and our victims,\" Hagar said.\nThe victims died from stab wounds, and the murder weapon was a knife, Hagar said Thursday. Knives were recovered from the residence's home, but it is unclear if any was the murder weapon, Rhoads said.\nHagar said police received over 500 tips and credited the public's help with bringing the suspect into custody.\nArkansas State Police had also released a composite sketch and photo from behind of a man who was seen in Devil's Den State Park on Saturday, the day of the killings. Police asked for the public's help in identifying the man, who they said was wanted for questioning in connection with the double homicide.\nPolice previously said the suspect was seen leaving the area of the park in a black, four-door sedan, possibly a Mazda, with a license plate covered by tape, police said. The vehicle description was \"critical\" in identifying the suspect, Rhoads said.\nThough he took steps to conceal his identity, the suspect was \"very sloppy,\" Rhoads said.\nOnce they identified the suspect, McGann was arrested within an hour at the barbershop, she said.\nPolice do not believe the suspect was trying to alter his appearance in getting a haircut, according to Rhoads, saying, \"Could chalk that up to school starts next week.\"\nThe Brinks had recently moved to Prairie Grove from North Dakota, police said.\nThe children are safe and in the custody of relatives, according to police.\n\"Our entire state is grieving for the tragic loss and senseless and horrific crime that's taken place,\" Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. \"One of the worst experiences that certainly I've ever had was making a phone call to the Brink family earlier this week. Nothing like that should ever have taken place.\"\nHagar said the Brinks were a loving couple, and credited their two young daughters with helping in the case, saying they are \"in awe\" of them.\n\"The information that they were able to provide to start us down this path, to be able to make this arrest, it all started with those two little girls,\" he said. \"It's incredible.\"\nHagar said the couple has a third daughter who wasn't at the trail that day.\n\"It is my intention to use the full weight of my office to bring this defendant to justice for the Brinks family,\" Brandon Carter, the prosecuting attorney for Washington County, said at Thursday's press briefing.\nThe prosecutor's office will not be waiving the death penalty in the case, Carter said.\nMcGann is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Friday, with an arraignment expected next week.\nAll trails at Devil's Den State Park, which were closed following the killings, will remain closed for now, Arkansas Secretary of Parks Shay Lewis said.\nABC News' Sasha Pezenik contributed to this report."

      "text": "Executives at private prison firm CoreCivic expect 'significant growth' due to Trump's policies\nTrump's new immigration policies \"directly impact our business,\" the CEO said.\nExecutives at CoreCivic, one of the nation's largest private prison companies, said they anticipate the Trump administration's new immigration policies will lead to \"the most significant growth\" in the company's history over the next several years.\n\"I've worked at CoreCivic for 32 years, and this is truly one of the most exciting periods of my career,\" CEO Damon Hininger said Tuesday on the company's earnings call. \"We anticipate significant growth opportunities, perhaps the most significant growth in our company's history over the next several years.\"\n\"The change in presidential administration on Jan. 20 has ushered in significant policy and legislative changes that directly impact our business,\" Hininger said on the public call, which comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement has increased its apprehensions of people alleged to be in the country illegally.\nHininger told shareholders that the company is taking proactive steps to prepare facilities and beds in anticipation of potential new contracts with ICE.\nCoreCivic executives on the call said they currently speak almost \"hourly\" with ICE officials and with members of the administration, and have \"active tours going on\" at their facilities.\n\"We've got a proposal in front of ICE for 28,000 beds,\" one executive said, adding that the offer could result in more than a billion dollars in revenue for the company.\nThe 28,000 beds offered to ICE comes from vacant facilities that are not currently activated, as well as from availability in existing facilities and from the South Texas Family Residential Center, the nation's largest migrant detention center that was closed in 2024, executives said.\nICE officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.\nIn response to questions about the administration's decision to use Guantanamo Bay and a prison in El Salvador to hold migrant detainees, executives for CoreCivic said they believe their facilities are \"superior\" to the alternatives when it comes to cost and logistics.\n\"We've got a real advantage on the cost side, especially in this environment. We've got DOGE out there looking at the best value for the government,\" Hininger said, referencing Elon Musk's new Department of Government Efficiency.\nThe CoreCivic CEO also said he believes the company's facilities are less likely to face litigation, and said they are \"more humane than the other alternatives.\"\n\"We're feeling very encouraged by the conversations with ICE to date,\" Hininger said. \"We've got a lot of activity going on in the organization, a lot of opportunities, so it's a very exciting time within the company.\""

      "text": "Judge temporarily blocks further construction of 'Alligator Alcatraz' detention center\nAny further construction must be halted for 14 days, the judge ruled.\nA federal judge on Thursday temporarily halted any further construction of the immigrant detention center known as \"Alligator Alcatraz.\"\nU.S. District Judge Kathleen Mary Williams granted a temporary restraining order after two days of testimony about the environmental impact of the site.\nThe state of Florida and President Donald Trump's administration can continue to use the facility and house detainees there, but any further construction must be halted for 14 days.\nWhile the hearing was set to resume on Tuesday, Judge Williams granted the temporary order to prevent possible harm to the sensitive Everglades ecosystem in the meantime\nEnvironmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida had urged Judge Williams to block the construction site because the detention center was completed without conducting necessary impact studies. The area is home to multiple sensitive species -- including the endangered Florida Panther -- and is considered sacred to the Miccosukee tribe.\n\"We welcome the court's decision to pause construction on this deeply concerning project. The detention facility threatens land that is not only environmentally sensitive but sacred to our people. While this order is temporary, it is an important step in asserting our rights and protecting our homeland. The Miccosukee Tribe will continue to stand for our culture, our sovereignty, and the Everglades,\" Miccosukee Chairman Talbert Cypress said in a statement.\nDuring the court proceedings on Thursday, the plaintiffs asked the judge for the restraining order citing fears that additional construction work, including paving work, would take place over the weekend ahead of the next court appearance, according to the judge's order.\nDuring the hearing Thursday, two experts told the judge that at least 20 acres of the site had been newly paved with asphalt, resulting in some 800,000 square feet of paving that, the experts testified, presented risks of runoff contamination into the natural water system around the site.\nA spokesperson for Florida AG James Uthmeier's office released a statement to ABC News in response to the judge's ruling.\n\"Judge Williams' order is wrong, and we will fight it. However, it does not shut down Alligator Alcatraz, which will continue to send illegal aliens back to where they came from,\" the statement read.\nThe judge's decision on Thursday comes after Wednesday's hearing only saw five witnesses called to the stand by the environmental groups that filed the lawsuit, instead of the multiple state and federal officials who were set to testify.\nAt issue is the question of whether federal and state officials bypassed legally required environmental impact studies during construction of the facility -- which plaintiffs say should block it from being used as a detention center.\nAttorneys representing Florida officials have argued that the facility was initially funded by, constructed and managed by the state and is therefore exempt from the National Environmental Policy Act -- the main law being used to challenge the facility's compliance.\nAlligator Alcatraz has so far operated in what immigration advocates have described as a jurisdictional gray zone -- with the facility funded by the federal government but run by the state of Florida -- that they allege allows officials to skirt some legal requirements.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has previously argued that the state of Florida is \"implementing\" the federal government's immigration policy with the expectation that the state would be fully reimbursed for the costs of Alligator Alcatraz, but local and federal officials have so far been unable to tell the federal courts who is actually in charge of the facility.\nThe hearing -- at which federal, state, and tribal officials are testifying -- comes amid heightened scrutiny of the facility, which was once touted as a \"one-stop shop to carry out President Trump's mass deportation agenda.\"\nLocated 50 miles west of Miami in the heart of the Florida Everglades, Alligator Alcatraz was quickly constructed over a matter of weeks, utilizing hundreds of tents, trailers, and other temporary facilities to potentially house more than 3,000 detainees.\nThe facility was built on the grounds of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, a sparsely used piece of tarmac owned by Miami-Dade County.\nAlligator Alcatraz also neighbors land leased to the Miccosukee Indian Tribe, including villages, a school, traditional hunting areas, and sacred sites. The Miccosukee Tribe joined the lawsuit last month, arguing that the facility threatens to damage nearby tribal villages."

CoreCivic reported a 9.8% revenue increase to $538.2 million, while Geo Group saw a 5% rise to $636.2 million, with both companies planning expansions to meet the rising demand for detention facilities. Executives from both firms expressed confidence in their alignment with government objectives, anticipating further opportunities for growth as ICE continues to rely on private contractors for housing detained migrants.",
