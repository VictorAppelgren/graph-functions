  "description": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX ) (SPY ) today is up +0.59%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI ) (DIA ) is up +0.33%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX ) (QQQ ) is up +0.70%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25 ) are up +0.54%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures...",
  "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) today is up +0.59%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) is up +0.33%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) is up +0.70%. September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are up +0.54%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are up +0.67%.\n\nStock indexes are climbing today, with the Nasdaq 100 posting a new record high. Stocks are supported by robust corporate earnings results and hopes that the Fed will soon cut interest rates to support the economy.\n\nMonster Beverage is up more than +7% after beating Q2 EPS estimates. Also, Expedia Group is up more than +4% after reporting better-than-expected Q2 EPS and raising its full-year forecast. On the negative side, Trade Desk is down more than -38% after giving an outlook that analysts said was underwhelming. Also, Microchip Technology is down more than -4% after pausing most factory expansions and cutting its full-year capital expenditures.\n\nStocks are seeing support from speculation that weaker-than-expected US economic news and recent dovish Fed commentary will push the Fed to lower interest rates as soon as next month. On Thursday, President Trump nominated Stephen Miran to be a temporary replacement for Adrianna Kugler as Fed Governor until the end of the year. Miran is currently chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors and is seen as dovish and supporting President Trump\u2019s calls for lower interest rates. The chances of a Fed rate cut at the September FOMC meeting rose to 91% from 40% last Friday.\n\nStocks extended their gains today as market sentiment improved after Bloomberg News reported that the US and Russia are aiming for a deal to end the war in Ukraine. Russia said it would halt its offensive in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine along the current battlelines as part of the deal if Ukraine cedes its entire eastern Donbas area to Russia as well as Crimea.\n\nIn recent tariff news, President Trump announced Wednesday that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, President Trump announced Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India\u2019s purchases of Russian oil. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced \u201cwithin the next week or so.\u201d According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 91% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 64% at the following meeting on October 28-29.\n\nEarnings reports released thus far suggest that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 79% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, around 83% exceeded profit estimates.\n\nOverseas stock markets today are mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.33%. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite closed down -0.12%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei Stock 225 climbed to a 2-week high and closed up sharply by +1.85%.\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) today are down by -7 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield is up +2.7 bp to 4.277%. T-notes are moving lower today as strength in stocks has reduced safe-haven demand for government securities. Also, rising inflation expectations are negative for T-notes as the 10-year breakeven inflation rate rose to a 1-week high today of 2.388%.\n\nLosses in T-notes are limited after President Trump late Thursday nominated Stephen Miran for Fed Governor to replace Adriana Kugler for the rest of the year. Miran views President Trump\u2019s policies as disinflationary and would support a more dovish Fed policy.\n\nEuropean government bond yields today are moving higher. The 10-year German bund yield is up +5.5 bp to 2.685%. The 10-year UK gilt yield is up +5.0 bp to 4.507%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 9% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\n\nGen Digital (GEN) is up more than +10% to lead gainers in the S&P 500 after reporting Q1 revenue of $1.26 billion, stronger than the consensus of $1.19 billion, and forecasting full-year revenue of $4.80-$4.90 billion, better than the consensus of $4.76 billion.\n\nGilead Sciences (GILD) is up more than +8% to lead gainers in the Nasdaq 100 after reporting Q2 product sales of $7.05 billion, above the consensus of $6.94 billion, and raising its full-year product sales forecast to $28.3 billion-$28.7 billion from a previous forecast of $28.2 billion-$28.6 billion.\n\nMonster Beverage (MNST) is up more than +7% after reporting Q2 net sales of $2.11 billion, stronger than the consensus of $2.08 billion.\n\nExpedia Group (EXPE) is up more than +4% after reporting Q2 revenue of $3.79 billion, better than the consensus of $3.71 billion, and raising its full-year gross bookings forecast to +3% to +5% from a previous estimate of +2% to +4%, the midpoint above the consensus of +3.3%.\n\nLive Nation Entertainment (LYV) is up more than +4% after reporting Q2 revenue of $7.01 billion, above the consensus of $6.89 billion.\n\nTesla (TSLA) is up more than +3% after it was granted a rideshare permit in Texas for operating its robotaxi service.\n\nTempus AI (TEM) is up more than +3% after reporting Q2 net revenue of $314.6 million, stronger than the consensus of $297.7 million.\n\nMaplebear (CART) is up more than +2% after reporting Q2 gross transaction value of $9.08 billion, above the consensus of $8.94 billion, and forecasting Q3 gross transaction value of $9.00 billion-$9.15 billion, better than the consensus of $8.96 billion.\n\nTrade Desk (TTD) is down more than -38% to lead losers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after reporting Q2 adjusted EPS of 41 cents, above the consensus of 40 cents but considered underwhelming by several analysts.\n\nSweetgreen (SG) is down more than -27% after reporting a Q2 EPS loss of -20 cents, wider than the consensus of -13 cents, and cut its full-year same-store sales forecast to down -4% to -6% from a previous forecast of no change.\n\nTwilio (TWLO) is down more than -17% after forecasting Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.01-$1.06, weaker than the consensus of $1.14.\n\nGoodyear Tire & Rubber (GT) is down more than -16% after reporting an unexpected Q2 loss per share of -17 cents versus expectations of a +19 cent profit.\n\nPinterest (PINS) is down more than -8% after reporting Q2 adjusted EPS of 33 cents, below the consensus of 36 cents.\n\nGoDaddy (GDDY) is down more than -6% after it reported Q2 revenue of $1.20 billion, below the consensus of $1.21 billion.\n\nMicrochip Technology (MCHP) is down more than -3% after forecasting Q2 net sales of $1.11 billion-$1.15 billion, the midpoint right on the consensus of $1.13 billion, considered disappointing by analysts.\n\nFreedom Holding Corp/NV (FRHC), Lamar Advertising Co (LAMR), Liberty Media Corp-Liberty Live (LLYVA), Skechers USA Inc (SKX), Sotera Health Co (SHC), Tempus AI Inc (TEM), Under Armour Inc (UAA), Wendy\u2019s Co/The (WEN).\n\u2022 SoundHound Just Reported 217% Revenue Growth.

      "text": "The Quote Overview page gives you a snapshot view for a specific index. During market hours, indices are 15 minute delay, ET. New delayed trade updates are updated on the page as indicated by a \"flash\".\nBarchart Symbol Notes Tutorial (8:43)\nQuoteboard data fields include:\n- Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session.\n- Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram.\n- Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session.\n- Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.\n- YTD High, Low, Change, %Change: The high and low price year-to-date, with the change and percent change year-to-date.\nChart Snapshot\nA thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.\nPrice Performance\nThis section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the \"See More\" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.\nOptions Overview\nHighlights important summary options statistics to provide a forward looking indication of investors' sentiment.\n- Implied Volatility: The average implied volatility (IV) of the nearest monthly options contract that is 30-days or more out. IV is a forward looking prediction of the likelihood of price change of the underlying asset, with a higher IV signifying that the market expects significant price movement, and a lower IV signifying the market expects the underlying asset price to remain within the current trading range.\n- 30-Day Historical Volatility: The average deviation from the average price over the last 30 days. Historical Volatility is a measurement of how fast the underlying security has been changing in price back in time.\n- IV Percentile: The percentage of days with IV closing below the current IV value over the prior 1-year. A high IV Percentile means the current IV is at a higher level than for most of the past year. This would occur after a period of significant price movement, and a high IV Percentile can often predict a coming market reversal in price.\n- IV Rank: The current IV compared to the highest and lowest values over the past 1-year. If IV Rank is 100% this means the IV is at its highest level over the past 1-year, and can signify the market is overbought.\n- IV High: The highest IV reading over the past 1-year and date it happened.\n- IV Low: The lowest IV reading over the past 1-year and date it happened.\n- Put/Call Vol Ratio: The total Put/Call volume ratio for all option contracts (across all expiration dates). A high put/call ratio can signify the market is oversold as more traders are buying puts rather than calls, and a low put/call ratio can signify the market is overbought as more traders are buying calls rather than puts.\n- Today's Volume: The total volume for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) traded during the current session.\n- Volume Avg (30-Day): The average volume for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) for the last 30-days.\n- Put/Call OI Ratio: The put/call open interest ratio for all options contracts (across all expiration dates).\n- Today's Open Interest: The total open interest for all option contracts (across all expiration dates).\n- Open Int (30-Day): The average total open interest for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) for the last 30 days.\nBarchart Technical Opinion\nThe Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overall Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy.\nThe Opinion will show on the Quote Overview Page for all asset classes with this exception: For all U.S. Stocks, the Market Cap must be greater than $1B.\nA symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:\n- Strong Buy (greater than \"66% Buy\")\n- Buy (greater than or equal to \"33% Buy\" and less than or equal to \"66% Buy\")\n- Weak Buy (\"0% Buy\" through \"33% Buy\")\n- Hold\n- Strong Sell (greater than \"66% Sell\")\n- Sell (greater than or equal to \"33% Sell\" and less than or equal to \"66% Sell\")\n- Weak Sell (\"0% Sell\" through \"33% Sell\")\nThe current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:\n- If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: \"The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal.\"\n- If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: \"The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal.\"\n- If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: \"The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal.\"\n- If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: \"The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal.\"\nRelated Stocks\nFor comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.\nBarchart Commodities Insider Commentary\nBarchart Commodities Insider is Ag market commentary for Grains and Oilseeds, Energy, Gold, Silver, Cocoa, Coffee, and Sugar markets.\nMost Recent Stories\nView the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).\nToday's New Highs & Lows\nThe New Highs/Lows widget provides a snapshot of US stocks that have made or matched a new high or low price for a specific time period. Stocks must have traded for the specified time period in order to be considered as a new High or Low.\nNew Highs/Lows only includes stocks traded on NYSE, NYSE Arca, Nasdaq or OTC-US exchanges with over 5 days of prices, with a last price above $0.25 and below $10,000, and with volume greater than 1000 shares.\nCalculations are adjusted for stock splits but not dividend distributions. Numbers exclude exclude unit investment trusts, closed end funds, warrant stocks, preferred securities and any non-SIC classified stock.\nPercentage of Stocks Above Moving Average\nFor the major indices on the site, this widget shows the percentage of stocks contained in the index that are above their 20-Day, 50-Day, 100-Day, 150-Day, and 200-Day Moving Averages.\nIn theory, the direction of the moving average (higher, lower or flat) indicates the trend of the market. Its slope indicates the strength of the trend. Longer averages are used to identify longer-term trends. Shorter averages are used to identify shorter-term trends. Many trading systems utilize moving averages as independent variables and market analysts frequently use moving averages to confirm technical breakouts.\nWhen prices are rising they are usually above the average. This is to be expected since the average includes data from the previous, lower priced days. As long as prices remain above the average there is strength in the market."

You agree that Barchart shall not be held liable for any trading activities or other activities that occur on any website you access through links on any Barchart Site. We provide these links as a convenience, and do not endorse the content or services offered by these other sites. Any dealings that you have with advertisers found on the Barchart Services are between you and the advertiser and you acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss or claim you may have against an advertiser.\nDISCLAIMER REGARDING CONTENT\nBarchart cannot and does not represent or warrant that any of the Content available through the Barchart Services is accurate, reliable, current, complete or appropriate for your needs. Various Content available through Barchart may be specially obtained by Barchart from professional businesses or organizations, such as exchanges, news providers, market data providers and other content providers (e.g., the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, CME Group and Dow Jones), who are believed to be sources of reliable Content (collectively, the \u201cData Providers\u201d). Nevertheless, due to various factors \u2014 including the inherent possibility of human and mechanical error \u2014 the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, results obtained from use, and correct sequencing of Content available through Barchart are not and cannot be guaranteed by Barchart.\nYOUR USE OF THE BARCHART SERVICES, THE CONTENT, AND ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE BARCHART SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SITES, CONTENT, AND ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE BARCHART SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. NEITHER BARCHART NOR ANY PERSON ASSOCIATED WITH BARCHART MAKES ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPLETENESS, SECURITY, RELIABILITY, QUALITY, ACCURACY, OR AVAILABILITY OF THE SITES. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, NEITHER BARCHART NOR ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH BARCHART REPRESENTS OR WARRANTS THAT THE SITES, THE CONTENT, OR ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE BARCHART SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, ERROR-FREE, OR UNINTERRUPTED, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, THAT THE SITES OR THE SERVERS THAT MAKE THEM AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT THE SITES OR ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE BARCHART SERVICES WILL OTHERWISE MEET YOUR NEEDS OR EXPECTATIONS.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, BARCHART HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY WARRANTIES THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.\nDISCLAIMER REGARDING HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS\nBARCHART MAKES NO REPRESENTATION THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN.\nHypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are mentioned below, and there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of the trading losses are material points, which can also adversely affect trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the market in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.\nDISCLAIMER REGARDING INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND TRADING\nDECISIONS TO BUY, SELL, HOLD OR TRADE IN SECURITIES, COMMODITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS INVOLVE RISK AND ARE BEST MADE BASED ON THE ADVICE OF QUALIFIED FINANCIAL PROFESSIONALS. ANY TRADING IN SECURITIES OR OTHER INVESTMENTS INVOLVES A RISK OF SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES. THE PRACTICE OF \u201cDAY TRADING\u201d INVOLVES PARTICULARLY HIGH RISKS AND CAN CAUSE YOU TO LOSE SUBSTANTIAL SUMS OF MONEY. BEFORE UNDERTAKING ANY TRADING PROGRAM, YOU SHOULD CONSULT A QUALIFIED FINANCIAL PROFESSIONAL. PLEASE CONSIDER CAREFULLY WHETHER SUCH TRADING IS SUITABLE FOR YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND ABILITY TO BEAR FINANCIAL RISKS. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE YOU OR ANYONE ELSE INCURS AS A RESULT OF ANY TRADING OR INVESTMENT ACTIVITY THAT YOU OR ANYONE ELSE ENGAGES IN BASED ON ANY INFORMATION OR MATERIAL YOU RECEIVE THROUGH THE BARCHART SERVICES.\nNO ADVICE OR SOLICITATION\nBARCHART CONTENT IS NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE TAX, LEGAL OR INVESTMENT ADVICE AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION BY BARCHART OF THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF SECURITIES.\nBARCHART DISCLOSURE POLICY\nBarchart believes in transparency, which is why we require all of our authors and contributors to disclose whether they own a position in any securities referenced in the article.

RECEIPT OF MARKET DATA BY SUBSCRIBER.\n- Vendor and Subscriber have entered into an agreement by which Vendor will, among other things, provide Subscriber with Market Data. Vendor has entered into agreements with each of the Exchanges whereby Vendor has been granted the right to receive Market Data and to retransmit the same to Subscriber. This Agreement to the agreement between Vendor and Subscriber sets forth the terms and conditions upon which Subscriber may receive and use Market Data.

Subscriber specifically agrees, without limiting or varying its obligations under paragraph 7 herein or otherwise set forth in this Agreement, that Subscriber shall not use or permit another person to use any Market Data for the purposes of determining or arriving at any price, including any settlement prices, for commodity futures contracts, options on commodity futures contracts, or like derivatives instruments traded on any exchange other than the Exchanges. Subscriber will abide by any other limitations on such use that any of the Exchanges may specify. Subscriber will use its best efforts to ensure that its partners, officers, directors, employees and agents maintain sole control and physical possession of, and sole access to, Market Data received through Devices in Subscriber's possession. (2) Notwithstanding (1) above, Subscriber may, in the regular course of its business, occasionally furnish, to each of its customers, branch offices, and guaranteed introducing brokers, in a quantity restricted to that necessary to enable Subscriber to conduct its business, a de minimis number of segments of Market Data. Such redissemination must be strictly limited to telephonic communications not entailing the use of computerized voice synthesization or any other technology and must be strictly related to the trading activity of Subscriber or any such recipients. Any such recipients must be advised by Subscriber that such segments are proprietary and confidential information not to be disclosed or disseminated to other persons or entities. Subscriber agrees to make all reasonable efforts to ensure that such recipients abide by the provisions of this Agreement.

Subscriber will make prompt adjustment (including interest thereon at the rate of 1.5% per month), through Vendor, to compensate any Exchange that discovers an under-reported use of the Market Data by Subscriber. In addition, at the election of any such Exchange, Subscriber will be liable for the reasonable costs of any audit that reveals a discrepancy in such Exchange's favor of five percent (5%) or more of the amount of fees actually due such Exchange. Subscriber shall maintain the records and books upon which it bases its reporting for Cboe, CBOT, CCX, CCFE, CME, GreenX, KCBOT, or ONECHICAGO Market Data for three (3) years following the period to which the records relate. Subscriber shall maintain the records and books upon which it bases the reporting for NYMEX, COMEX, ICE FUTURES US, ICE FUTURES EUROPE, or ICE FUTURES CANADA Market Data for six (6) years following the period to which the records and books relate. In the event that Subscriber fails to retain such records and books as required above, Subscriber agrees to pay each Exchange's reasonable estimate of any discrepancy discovered pursuant to any such audit.\n6. EXCHANGE FEES.\nSubscriber will pay Vendor (unless Vendor has assumed Subscriber's payment obligations hereunder), for and on behalf of each of the Exchanges (as applicable), for the right to receive Market Data in accordance with the then-current fee schedule published by each of the Exchanges from time-to- time (including any and all applicable federal, state or local taxes). Each Exchange's fees are subject to modification by each of them at any time, without prior notice to Subscriber. In addition, Subscriber agrees to pay Vendor any penalties assessed against Subscriber by Vendor on behalf of any Exchange.

COVENANTS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SUBSCRIBER.\nSubscriber covenants, represents and warrants that it is not engaged in the business of distributing Market Data and that, to its knowledge after reasonable inquiry, it is receiving the Market Data from a Vendor that is authorized by the Exchanges to distribute the Market Data.

LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND DAMAGES.\nSubscriber agrees that: (i) the provision of Market Data is made with equipment, communications devices, and/or leased lines not owned or operated solely by Vendor or the Exchanges; (ii) neither Vendor nor the Exchanges, nor their respective members, directors, officers, employees or agents, guarantees the sequence, accuracy or completeness of the Market Data, nor shall any of them be liable to Subscriber or any other Person for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions in Market Data, or in the transmission thereof, or for any other damages arising in connection with Subscriber's receipt or use of Market Data, whether or not resulting from negligence on their part, a Force Majeure Event or any other cause beyond their reasonable control; and (iii) if the foregoing disclaimer and limitation of liability should be deemed invalid or ineffective by a court of competent jurisdiction, neither Vendor nor the Exchanges, nor their respective members, directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable for any of the foregoing beyond the actual amount of loss or damage, or the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00), whichever is less.\n10.

New delayed trade updates are updated on the page as indicated by a \"flash\".\nBarchart Symbol Notes Tutorial (8:43)\nQuoteboard data fields include:\n- Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session.\n- Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram.\n- Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session.\n- Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.\n- YTD High, Low, Change, %Change: The high and low price year-to-date, with the change and percent change year-to-date.\nChart Snapshot\nA thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.\nPrice Performance\nThis section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the \"See More\" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.\nOptions Overview\nHighlights important summary options statistics to provide a forward looking indication of investors' sentiment.\n- Implied Volatility: The average implied volatility (IV) of the nearest monthly options contract that is 30-days or more out. IV is a forward looking prediction of the likelihood of price change of the underlying asset, with a higher IV signifying that the market expects significant price movement, and a lower IV signifying the market expects the underlying asset price to remain within the current trading range.\n- 30-Day Historical Volatility: The average deviation from the average price over the last 30 days. Historical Volatility is a measurement of how fast the underlying security has been changing in price back in time.\n- IV Percentile: The percentage of days with IV closing below the current IV value over the prior 1-year. A high IV Percentile means the current IV is at a higher level than for most of the past year. This would occur after a period of significant price movement, and a high IV Percentile can often predict a coming market reversal in price.\n- IV Rank: The current IV compared to the highest and lowest values over the past 1-year. If IV Rank is 100% this means the IV is at its highest level over the past 1-year, and can signify the market is overbought.\n- IV High: The highest IV reading over the past 1-year and date it happened.\n- IV Low: The lowest IV reading over the past 1-year and date it happened.\n- Put/Call Vol Ratio: The total Put/Call volume ratio for all option contracts (across all expiration dates). A high put/call ratio can signify the market is oversold as more traders are buying puts rather than calls, and a low put/call ratio can signify the market is overbought as more traders are buying calls rather than puts.\n- Today's Volume: The total volume for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) traded during the current session.\n- Volume Avg (30-Day): The average volume for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) for the last 30-days.\n- Put/Call OI Ratio: The put/call open interest ratio for all options contracts (across all expiration dates).\n- Today's Open Interest: The total open interest for all option contracts (across all expiration dates).\n- Open Int (30-Day): The average total open interest for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) for the last 30 days.\nBarchart Technical Opinion\nThe Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overall Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy.\nThe Opinion will show on the Quote Overview Page for all asset classes with this exception: For all U.S. Stocks, the Market Cap must be greater than $1B.\nA symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:\n- Strong Buy (greater than \"66% Buy\")\n- Buy (greater than or equal to \"33% Buy\" and less than or equal to \"66% Buy\")\n- Weak Buy (\"0% Buy\" through \"33% Buy\")\n- Hold\n- Strong Sell (greater than \"66% Sell\")\n- Sell (greater than or equal to \"33% Sell\" and less than or equal to \"66% Sell\")\n- Weak Sell (\"0% Sell\" through \"33% Sell\")\nThe current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:\n- If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: \"The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal.\"\n- If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: \"The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal.\"\n- If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: \"The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal.\"\n- If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: \"The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal.\"\nRelated Stocks\nFor comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.\nBarchart Commodities Insider Commentary\nBarchart Commodities Insider is Ag market commentary for Grains and Oilseeds, Energy, Gold, Silver, Cocoa, Coffee, and Sugar markets.\nMost Recent Stories\nView the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).\nToday's New Highs & Lows\nThe New Highs/Lows widget provides a snapshot of US stocks that have made or matched a new high or low price for a specific time period. Stocks must have traded for the specified time period in order to be considered as a new High or Low.\nNew Highs/Lows only includes stocks traded on NYSE, NYSE Arca, Nasdaq or OTC-US exchanges with over 5 days of prices, with a last price above $0.25 and below $10,000, and with volume greater than 1000 shares.\nCalculations are adjusted for stock splits but not dividend distributions. Numbers exclude exclude unit investment trusts, closed end funds, warrant stocks, preferred securities and any non-SIC classified stock.\nPercentage of Stocks Above Moving Average\nFor the major indices on the site, this widget shows the percentage of stocks contained in the index that are above their 20-Day, 50-Day, 100-Day, 150-Day, and 200-Day Moving Averages.\nIn theory, the direction of the moving average (higher, lower or flat) indicates the trend of the market. Its slope indicates the strength of the trend. Longer averages are used to identify longer-term trends. Shorter averages are used to identify shorter-term trends. Many trading systems utilize moving averages as independent variables and market analysts frequently use moving averages to confirm technical breakouts.\nWhen prices are rising they are usually above the average. This is to be expected since the average includes data from the previous, lower priced days. As long as prices remain above the average there is strength in the market."
