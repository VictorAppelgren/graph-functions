  "content": "We recently published Jim Cramer Said AI Is A \u201cSouped-Up Google\u201d As He Discussed These 11 Stocks. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nHome improvement retailer The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\u2019s shares have gained a modest 5% year-to-date as the firm has struggled in a high-interest-rate environment. However, over the past month, the shares have gained 8% driven by catalysts such as its second quarter earnings report, which saw the firm outline that its same store sales growth stood at 1% overall and 4% in the US. The growth indicated to investors that there was some life in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\u2019s market. Cramer discussed the firm\u2019s earnings call:\n\n\u201c[On short term rates falling but high end not budging] It\u2019s very interesting because on the Home Depot call, which was such an excellent call, they talked about the need to be able to at least get the short term rates down for home equity loans cause it\u2019s not having to do it, not having many remodeling. Which, you need either remodel, or sales. Now sales is the long end, but remodel is the short end. They\u2019ll take either and they are the biggest.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC TV host discussed The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in detail after its earnings. Here is what he said:\n\n\u201cWe got results from Cramer fave, Home Depot, a stock I\u2019m very happy to own for the Charitable Trust, but the numbers confused a lot of people\u2026 The quarter was good. See, you can\u2019t judge earnings by the headline numbers alone\u2026 For starters, management emphasized that the momentum they saw in the back half of last year carried into the first half of this year\u2026",

      "text": "In this piece, we will look at the stocks that Jim Cramer recently discussed.\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed market and industry doubts about AI. The CNBC TV host commented on reports suggesting that the costs of investing in AI were too much, while the profit was too little. Cramer believes that while the costs of AI are high, the returns will also appear soon enough. He also called AI a souped-up Google:\n\u201cI think you have to recognize that this is the most, because of the numbers you cited, this is the most I\u2019ve heard of, emperor no. clothes, and yet I think we are right at the cusp of reasoning. And the thing that bothers people, right now it\u2019s a souped-up Google, people won\u2019t call it that, but I\u2019m calling it that. But what I\u2019m saying is this that we\u2019re so close to reasoning, so close to be able to have a dialogue and it correcting us, that you want to get off the horse now?\u201d\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on August 27th.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n11. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2025: 235\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s earnings report saw the shares fall by as much as 4% in aftermarket trading. Cramer discussed the stock in detail the day before its earnings and shared a key metric that had to be addressed during the earnings call for the firm\u2019s long-term success:\n\u201cOkay, so, we actually had the CEO of MongoDB on this morning, talking about the overspending. Are the hyperscalers overspending? Does it really matter? . . .Talked about hallucination and the problems there. I come back and say, the answer to everything, come to this company. You cannot have generative AI, the way you\u2019d like to, without NVIDIA. So you\u2019re going to have, what some people say, overspend, but, its the table stakes, it\u2019s the price to be in the business. David, there are a lot of people who feel this will come up tonight, that the total cost of ownership in NVIDIA has gotten too high and you can\u2019t make money with it.\n\u201c[When asked what he meant by total cost of ownership] Cause if you buy the stuff and then you have it inserted by Dell, and you try to train on it and you have the inference, it turns out that you lose money.\n\u201cOkay so the rap is, NVIDIA makes all the money and nobody else does. And that\u2019s what has to be addressed tonight. Not China. I mean everyone\u2019s going to say China, it\u2019s like, yes, okay so you\u2019re a parrot. . well that\u2019s those people. Well, I mean, no kidding, China. What matters is that we hear from Jensen Huang about that whole narrative, that the spend isn\u2019t getting them any results, is false.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to disagree with that, but I think Jensen might be able to say, look, the return here is monstrous, you just have to be able to bear with it.\n\u201c[On talks about not being able to replace with AI what was happening with key software providers] Look, I think that\u2019s a really important narrative, but I think what\u2019s more important and why this conference call is valuable, is because if that\u2019s the case, what\u2019s the demand? I mean the demand, some people say it might be as high as ten to one. . .but I do think that there is a case to be made that this is by far the most important stock in the market.\n\u201cFor the longest time in the world software is what mattered. Before that by the way, it was, just so you know, oil. . .but it was these, it finally became semiconductors. And for the longest time until Lip-Bu was the only person, Lip-Bu Tan, the now loved from the White House, was saying listen, one day, semiconductors are going to rule the world again. Not unlike dinosaurs. And what happened is, it happened. Because of NVIDIA.\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying, the zeitgeist in this country had always been enterprise software, that\u2019s how you made all your money. Right. Software. . .you have this one country, but you do not have the other semis. . .but it\u2019s just this one semi, but semiconductors have reasserted what maybe from the days when Intel, when the Texas Instruments. . .\n\u201cPeople at home are trying to figure out why we are so possessed with NVIDIA? If it looks like that no one\u2019s getting any return from NVIDIA, if it looks like that they had to go to the President to get China. And the reason is we are either going to make a lot of money with AI, right, or Dev, Dev Ittycheria, from MongoDB, says listen no one\u2019s going to make any money. Which means the only company that\u2019s going to make money is NVIDIA. Which means in the end you\u2019re going to hear someone break ranks. That\u2019s what everyone is scared about.\u201d\n\u201cI think you have to. But frankly I don\u2019t trust anything from China. Look DeepSeek got people out. 50% ago and that was a disaster. I\u2019m trying to keep people in. And I try to keep people in and why I wore by the way just so you know, my NVIDIA cufflinks today? Because I want people to be in. Remember 2017. Where were the other guys? When I was naming my dog NVIDIA, where was the other guys? Now they\u2019re all in the party. At 4.4 trillion.\u201d\n10. MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2025: 75\nMongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) is a software company that enables businesses to manipulate and work with data. Its shares have gained a whopping 40% over the past five days after its second-quarter revenue, earnings, and subscription revenue of $591 million, $1, and $572 million all beat analyst estimates. Cramer discussed the stock with his co-host David Faber:\n\u201cAnd the reason is we are either going to make a lot of money with AI, right, or Dev, Dev Ittycheria, from MongoDB, says listen no one\u2019s going to make any money.\n\u201cThe reason I\u2019m mentioning Dev, I\u2019m mentioning Dev is because his stock is up 70 points. . .\n\u201cMongoDB is not AI. It\u2019s software that you can use to be able to build an AI program on, but it\u2019s a software company so we\u2019re seeing enterprise software have its day in the sun, including that Wall Street Journal article. Enjoy it while it lasts.\n\u201c[After Faber commented that it was worth mentioning that MDB\u2019s stock based compensation added to non-GAAP EPS meant that the firm lost 58 cents] It absolutely is and remember this is this AI versus software, but you need, you get MongoDB software it\u2019s better, you\u2019re able to write programs. So let\u2019s say you have a business, and you\u2019re using Shopify, okay, and it shows you that you have lots of customers in California and lots of customers in Texas, not a lot of customers in Pennsylvania. You don\u2019t know what to do with that. You run it through MongoDB and it tells you that, well that pattern is because people like potato chips in Northern California. It lets you interrogate the data. And that\u2019s a terrific thing, but it is not AI.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "Jim Cramer discussed AI\u2019s high costs but promising returns, labeling it a \"souped\u2011up Google\", and highlighted several stocks he recommends, including Home\u00a0Depot, NVIDIA, and MongoDB. He praised Home\u00a0Depot\u2019s Q2 earnings, noting 1% same\u2011store sales growth and an 8% month\u2011to\u2011date rally driven by a strong earnings call and expectations of lower short\u2011term rates. Cramer emphasized NVIDIA\u2019s centrality to generative AI, citing its GPU dominance and high cost of ownership concerns, while MongoDB was highlighted as a key enterprise software platform enabling AI development. The piece also notes the broader market context of rising rates, AI investment costs, and the potential for AI to reshape the technology sector.",
