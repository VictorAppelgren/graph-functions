      "feedback": "Strong start and a dense evidence base, but the Movers section currently violates the four-line constraint and scatters first-principles logic; fix by delivering exactly 4 lines for Movers & Scenarios (2 Up, 2 Down), each in the strict Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability % format, with a consistent 3–6 month horizon and no stray Outlook line inside this block. Rebuild each line around a tight, causal, first-principles chain: Tariff policy and pass-through drive inflation/margin risk; deregulation/deregulatory drift changes policy risk premia and capex allocation; cross-border commitments and energy signals anchor the macro backdrop; reinforce with a single, crisp driver per line and a focused watchlist item that would validate or invalidate that path. Quantify every factual claim that uses numbers from the sources (e.g., MFN 15% baseline, 60–70% pass-through, 18.6% average tariff, $750B energy commitments, $600B investment, etc.), and attach in-text IDs immediately after the relevant clause; keep probability numbers grounded in the material’s tone (e.g., “base-case moderate confidence,” and explicit catalysts) rather than ad hoc estimates. Ensure all critical sources are cited on the lines that rely on them (RHFWI02JT, 2SJORBV6H, QRX2HD4X0, 9W8ZUIBDY, OFY11YO0I, WLXM1819K, AJTHKYXQ3, CWVWSACA7, DNG58CC09, 3T8AGCL7T), reconciliing conflicts by showing a clear invalidation criterion for each path. Move the Outlook/Trade Plan out of the Movers block into a separate 1–2-line Trade/Outlook Plan; if you treat the asset as tradable, present a single Swing Trade line with explicit Direction, Horizon, Entry, Stop, Target, R/R, Invalidation, Trigger, Probability %, and Confidence (use a credible anchor like the EU autos-relief trigger and its timing); otherwise provide a concise, single Outlook line with Direction, Horizon, Expected path, Decision signals, Invalidation, Trigger, Probability %, and Confidence. Finally, ensure language is precise, avoids generic platitudes, and uses a consistent 3–6 month framing across all four lines to support coherent market transmission from tariff regime to pricing, margins, and investment flows.",
