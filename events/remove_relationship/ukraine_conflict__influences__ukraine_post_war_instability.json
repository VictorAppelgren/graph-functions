      "fundamental_analysis": "Over a multi‑year horizon, the structural anchors begin with first‑principles that will shape risk pricing: (1) real rate differentials between the US/EU and Russia largely drive relative demand for risk‑free versus risk assets and the cost of external financing for both Moscow and Kyiv; (2) terms of trade and the net external position are distorted by sustained defense outlays and sanctions, which feed through to current‑ and capital‑account dynamics; (3) a defense‑capital shock shifts productivity and investment in the defense sector relative to civilian sectors, altering growth trajectories and external balances; and (4) policy reaction functions in the US/EU—how sanctions tighten, ease, or be re‑calibrated—set the slope of sovereign risk premia and funding costs. Within this framework, we define three regimes to describe likely pathways: Regime A—credible Alaska framework with potential sanctions relief and a material but contained compression of risk premia; Regime B—stalemate with persistently elevated premia and little external relief; Regime C—escalation with higher premia and a meaningful drag on growth. Transition conditions are explicit: a concrete Alaska readout signaling a credible ceasefire path or relief, progress on ceasefire terms, or new sanctions rounds alter regime status. The Alaska hinge—anticipated around mid‑August—acts as the pivotal event that could reprice geopolitical risk and sanctions expectations; underpinning this view is the war‑cost structure: Russia has deployed roughly 29,000 Shahed drones and decoys and more than 900 missiles in 2025, with drone costs around $200,000 per unit and drone outlays reaching roughly $5.7 billion, taking the total 2025 aerial campaign toward $13.4 billion (DK94SSAEY). Ukraine, for its part, has tripled long‑range drone strikes on Russian territory to about 14,000 drones this year, including roughly 3,300 in July, and has deployed at least 48 Neptune cruise missiles and 29 Storm Shadow missiles, with Ukrainian production goals for 2025 aiming at 30,000 long‑range drones and 3,000 cruise and drone‑missiles, illustrating a structural shift toward domestic production and expanded strike capability (DK94SSAEY). Note that the source text contains attribution quirks (listing J.D. Vance as U.S. Vice President and David Lammy as UK Foreign Minister); treat these as data‑quality issues rather than factual assertions (DK94SSAEY).\n\nFrom a transmission perspective, the war‑cost dynamic constrains Russia’s fiscal space and raises sovereign risk premia, while sanctions reshape the external financing environment; European and US policy discussions—emphasizing stronger sanctions leverage to enforce ceasefires—feed through to external balances, funding costs, and pricing of risk assets, via higher yields, widening spreads, currency moves, and volatile growth paths (DK94SSAEY). Base case: if Alaska yields a credible framework by late 2025, we would expect modest risk premia compression and some sanctions relief, translating into a softer but still uncertain macro backdrop for both economies; if no credible breakthrough emerges, sanctions persist or widen and premia stay elevated, implying clearer downside risks for growth and asset prices. Three scenarios help frame market implications: Scenario 1—Alaska delivers a credible framework with phased sanctions relief; implied outcomes are modest sovereign yield compression and tempered risk‑asset upside; Scenario 2—no framework progress; premia remain high, USD strength persists, and equities underperform relative to baseline; Scenario 3—escalation with rising drone/missile costs and tighter sanctions; a larger risk premium, greater currency volatility, and a more pronounced growth drag. Across these paths, the Alaska hinge remains the dominant moderator of regime state, with the precise market responses contingent on the readout and subsequent policy steps (DK94SSAEY).\n\nWhat to watch and how to invalidate the base case are explicit: monitor the Alaska readout for a credible framework or any path to ceasefire/relief, track new sanctions announcements or relief steps, and follow the trajectory of drone/missile activity and Kyiv/Moscow production metrics; an invalidation would occur if no credible Alaska framework emerges by a defined window (e.g., end‑2025) or if the readout rejects any pathway to relief, warranting an immediate reclassification to Regime B or C and a corresponding shift in market implications. Confidence hinges on the hinge nature of Alaska, but the line between regime states remains highly uncertain due to negotiation durability and the evolving cost dynamics of the war. (DK94SSAEY)",
