      "summary": "The article describes the Pacific Berkut, a $12 billion, 200,000‑ton gravity‑based offshore rig operating in Russia’s Sea of Okhotsk near Sakhalin Island, and highlights its massive dimensions and extreme Arctic operating conditions. It explains how offshore rigs are designed and built on land, transported, and anchored, emphasizing engineering challenges such as buoyancy, stability, and harsh weather. The piece notes the high construction costs—ranging from $20 million for smaller units to over $1 billion for larger rigs—and the long pay‑back horizon of roughly ten years, underscoring oil’s continued importance amid renewable energy transitions.",
