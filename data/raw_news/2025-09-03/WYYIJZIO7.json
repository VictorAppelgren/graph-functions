  "title": "8 Data-Based Tips To Help Leaders Win On LinkedIn In 2025",
  "description": "Here\u2019s what our latest data says about how modern leaders are earning attention, building trust and driving real influence on LinkedIn in 2025.",
  "content": "Justin Nassiri is the CEO of Executive Presence, helping companies build trust & awareness through executive thought leadership on LinkedIn.\n\nIn 2025, LinkedIn is no longer just a professional platform\u2014it\u2019s a leadership platform. We analyzed over 8,000 LinkedIn posts from C-level executives and founders, generating more than 37 million views and 500,000 engagements. The goal? To understand what\u2019s actually working on the platform this year.\n\nThe short version: What worked in 2022 won\u2019t cut it in 2025. The algorithm has evolved. So has audience behavior. And the bar for credibility has never been higher.\n\nHere\u2019s what our latest data says about how modern leaders are earning attention, building trust and driving real influence on LinkedIn this year:\n\nMany executives still ask, \u201cHow often should I post?\u201d We found that posting two to three times per week generated 57% more engagement per post than those who post once a week. Why? Frequency builds familiarity. It reduces the pressure to be perfect. And, most importantly, it keeps you visible. LinkedIn posts decay quickly\u2014we found that most earn the majority of their views within 24 hours. If you\u2019re only posting once a week, you\u2019re invisible more than 85% of the time.\n\nDespite fears of \u201cscroll fatigue,\u201d our research indicated that posts between 1,500 and 3,000 characters have the highest engagement rates (2.10%). Leaders who take the space to tell a story, break down an idea or reflect on a hard-earned lesson are rewarded with more interaction and deeper trust.\n\nShort posts under 250 characters? They may be easy to write, but they rarely land. The takeaway: If you have something meaningful to say, say it well\u2014and use line breaks to keep it digestible.\n\nFor the first time since we've been studying LinkedIn, video posts edged out images as the top-performing format (2.35% engagement vs. 2.32%). But before you start filming, consider this: The best-performing videos are native to the platform and insight-rich\u2014not flashy, TikTok-style reels.\n\nImage posts remain the most scalable and reliable tactic for most leaders. Meanwhile, resharing others\u2019 posts or overusing carousels significantly underperforms. In fact, reshares earned less than half the engagement of original content.\n\n4. Original thought is valued more than amplification.\n\nThe algorithm\u2014and your audience\u2014are clearly prioritizing authorship. Posts written directly by the executive generated twice the engagement of reshares, even when commentary was added. LinkedIn doesn\u2019t just reward content. It rewards credibility. Audiences can feel when a post reflects personal insight rather than marketing polish.\n\nPromotional posts\u2014especially those focused on the company\u2014are often seen as noise. When we crunched the numbers, educational content delivered a 42% higher engagement rate than promotional content. The lesson is that the more value you give away, the more attention you earn.\n\nInterestingly, posts that mentioned the company by name did perform better, but only when paired with a personal lens. The winning formula: Lead with a story, insight or value, then tie it back to your company.\n\nSimilarly, when we categorized posts by content pillar, the highest engagement rates came from personal storytelling and leadership reflections. Authentic, reflective posts outperformed company updates, even when the topic was the same. If you\u2019re trying to build executive presence on LinkedIn, don\u2019t just tell people what your company does. Show them how you think and who you are as a leader.\n\nContrary to old advice, adding more than four relevant hashtags correlated with the highest engagement rates (2.2%) we saw. Hashtags may now play a stronger role in helping posts reach niche, high-intent audiences\u2014especially in verticals like tech, venture capital and climate. I recommend using three to five well-targeted hashtags to clarify the focus of your post\u2014not to chase trends.\n\nNot surprisingly, leaders with larger audiences saw more reach. But what\u2019s most important is how they got there. Frequent, consistent posting\u2014not viral hits\u2014was the common thread. Even executives with just a few thousand followers generated meaningful business results when their content was intentional and regular. Consistency is the compound interest of LinkedIn.\n\nIn a digital world full of noise, thought leadership isn\u2019t about showing up. It\u2019s about showing up with substance. The most successful executives on LinkedIn in 2025 are not just posting. They\u2019re teaching through insight, leading through reflection and promoting with authenticity. And most importantly, they\u2019re doing it consistently.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a content game. It\u2019s a credibility game. And the leaders who understand that are already winning.\n\nis the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.",
