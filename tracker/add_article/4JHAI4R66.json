      "summary": "Gazprom announced a binding deal to build a massive Russia‑to‑China natural gas pipeline, a potential diplomatic win for Moscow after stalled talks on Power of Siberia 2. The project could shrink the long‑term U.S. LNG market and signal stronger strategic ties, but key details such as pricing and financing remain undisclosed. Analysts warn that China’s growing domestic gas production and alternative technologies may limit demand, and Russia could even lose money depending on the financing terms. The deal’s geopolitical motives—showing defiance against Western pressure—outweigh its economic certainty, leaving its ultimate impact uncertain.",
