  "content": "Real estate mogul Grant Cardone has listed his $42M Miami beach mansion for 400 Bitcoin only \u2014 no cash accepted.\n\nGrant Cardone has never been one to play small. The real estate mogul, author, and motivational speaker built an empire with Cardone Capital, controlling billions in multifamily properties across the U.S.\n\nHe\u2019s sold out arenas, coached entrepreneurs, and turned himself into a brand synonymous with aggressive growth. Now, he\u2019s putting that same bold approach to work in crypto.\n\nCardone has long flirted with Bitcoin as an asset class, praising its potential as a hedge against inflation. And in true Cardone fashion, he\u2019s not dipping a toe into the space \u2014 he\u2019s cannonballing. This week, he listed his luxury oceanfront mansion in Golden Beach, Miami, with a price tag denominated entirely in Bitcoin.\n\n\u201c605 Ocean Blvd \u2013 Listed for Sale BTC ONLY \u2013 Trying to catch the DIP. Best Ocean Front Beach Entry in ALL of Miami. Quick Sale 400 BTC,\u201d Cardone posted on X to his 720,000 followers.\n\nThe listing, shared via Propy and realtor platforms, features a 13,000+ square foot home with seven bedrooms, 12 bathrooms, an infinity pool, a private beachfront cabana, and a gourmet kitchen kitted with Subzero and Gaggenau appliances.\n\nDesigned by Martyn Lawrence Bullard and even featured in Architectural Digest, the estate is pure Miami glamour \u2014 glass, marble, saltwater pool, skylights, and 100 feet of private ocean frontage.\n\nThe ask: Well, 400 BTC.\n\nAt today\u2019s Kraken's price of about $107,700 per Bitcoin, that comes to roughly $43 million. The realtor listing pegs it at $42 million, making Cardone\u2019s math pretty spot on.\n\nAt 400 BTC, the mansion locks in at today\u2019s spot rate. But here\u2019s the wrinkle: historically, Bitcoin has delivered returns far beyond real estate.\n\u2022 Five years ago, 400 BTC would have cost around $1.5 million total. Today, that stash is worth more than $43 million.\n\u2022 Over the past 12 months alone, Bitcoin has climbed about 80%, outpacing most real estate markets.\n\u2022 The all-time high of Bitcoin, just a few weeks ago in August 2025, hit $124,128. At that price, Cardone\u2019s ask would equal nearly $50 million.\n\nSo, is it worth swapping Bitcoin for Miami marble?\n\nThe answer depends on your view. If Bitcoin continues its historic trajectory, the buyer might one day regret parting with 400 BTC for a mansion. On the other hand, it\u2019s a hedge: real estate provides utility, lifestyle, and a tangible store of value \u2014 things Bitcoin doesn\u2019t.",
