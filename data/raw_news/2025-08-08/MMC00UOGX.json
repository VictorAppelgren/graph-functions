  "description": "Want to hit millionaire status? Preston Seo shares 3 key financial numbers to track now to build wealth smarter and faster in 2025.",
  "content": "Want to become a millionaire? YouTuber and investment guru Preston Seo said it\u2019s possible if you know what numbers to track. Seo said that even if you\u2019re putting away money in savings every month, you could still be losing money if you\u2019re not employing the right growth strategies.\n\nTrending Now: Never Do These 3 Things With Your Money, Says Personal Finance Pro Humphrey Yang\n\nFor You: 10 Used Cars That Will Last Longer Than the Average New Vehicle\n\nOn his YouTube channel Legacy Investing Show, Seo made a video that breaks down exactly what you should be looking at to fast track your journey to becoming financially free. Find out what those three numbers are and how to use them to grow your wealth.\n\nThe first number Seo said you need to be aware of is your net worth. Your net worth is your assets minus your liabilities. Your assets are defined as things like property you own, stocks you invest in and money you have in the bank. Your liabilities are any loans or debt you have. Seo pointed out most people don\u2019t track their net worth closely or regularly.\n\n\u201cThe moment you start tracking your net worth, you stop playing the \u2018I hope I have enough money\u2019 game and start actually building wealth,\u201d he said.\n\nDiscover More: The No. 1 Way Americans Become Millionaires Is Pretty Boring \u2014 and Easy To Do\n\nSeo said this doesn\u2019t have to be a formal process. You can just update your numbers in a spreadsheet once a month and track what\u2019s growing and what\u2019s holding you back.\n\n\u201cOnce you see that number consistently going up, you\u2019re going to be addicted to making smarter financial moves,\u201d the YouTuber said. One smart move he suggested was taking money from a traditional savings account and putting it in investments or at least a high-yield savings account.\n\nKnowing your net worth is great, but it really doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re spending everything you make.\n\nSeo defined savings rate as your income minus expenses divided by your income multiplied by 100. So if your monthly income is $5,000, and you spend $3,000 of it you take 2,000 and divide it by 500,000 and you get a savings rate of 0.004. The higher your rate, the faster you\u2019ll reach financial freedom, according to Seo.\n\n\u201cMost people save less than 5% of their income. That means they have to work for 40 [plus] years before they can retire. But if you save 50%, you cut that time in half. If you push yourself to 70%, maybe 80%, you become financially free in less than a decade,\u201d he explained.\n\nSeo said your freedom number is the amount of money you need to make in order to never work again.",

      "text": "What Is Net Worth and How Do You Calculate It?\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nWhen you hear media reports that a celebrity is \u201cworth\u201d millions or billions of dollars, that worth refers to the individual\u2019s net worth, which is a measure of wealth. Everyone has a net worth, and knowing what yours is gives you a clear picture of your financial health and can help you set goals for the future.\nWhat Is Net Worth?\nYour net worth is the net value of your assets. You calculate it by subtracting your liabilities from your assets.\nWhat Are Assets?\nAssets are everything you own that has value. They add to your net worth.\nAssets include cash and cash equivalents such as:\n- Bank account balances\n- Investment account balances, including individual retirement and 401(k) balances and the balances of any other brokerage accounts\n- Cash value of insurance products such as whole life policies and annuities\nMaterial possessions also count as assets. The value of your home, cars, jewelry, household items, sports and hobby equipment and collectibles \u2014 basically anything you own that you could sell for cash \u2014 all add to your net worth.\nWhat Are Liabilities?\nLiabilities are funds you owe, and as such, they reduce your net worth. Credit card balances and the balances owed on your mortgage, car loans, personal loans and student loans are all liabilities. So are rent, taxes, utility bills and other expenses you haven\u2019t yet paid.\nWhy It\u2019s Important To Know Your Net Worth\nMany people use income as a barometer of how they\u2019re doing financially, but outside of the context of debt and other obligations, income can be deceiving. \u201cYou could look like you\u2019re worth a million bucks. But in reality, everything you own could be leveraged or have a loan associated with it,\u201d Douglas Boneparth, president and founder of Bone Fide Wealth, told CNBC\u2019s Make It.\nNet worth, on the other hand, paints a more complete picture of your wealth because it shows the relationship between income and spending. That information is vital for assessing your financial health as well as for setting goals and following your progress toward reaching them.\nImagine, for example, that you\u2019re a student, just beginning your financial life. You\u2019ve taken on $38,000 in student loan debt and run up $5,000 on your credit cards to get through life. You\u2019ve also managed to save an admirable $10,000 in your emergency fund and you have $1,200 in your checking account. Doing the math shows that you have a net worth of negative $31,800.\nAnytime you have a negative net worth, it\u2019s a sign that you have to make some changes in your financial life. As a student just starting out, having a negative net worth isn\u2019t as problematic, as you theoretically have a long life of rising paychecks ahead of you. But you\u2019ll still want to get on the ball and make sure your credit card debt doesn\u2019t get out of hand, because that\u2019s a financial hole that can be extremely difficult to get out of.\nNow, flash forward to a decade in the future, when you\u2019ve been working for a few years and have been diligently saving up to buy your first home. At that stage, your financial profile might look like this:\n- Checking account: $2,600\n- Savings account: $52,200\n- Retirement savings: $28,000\n- Credit card debt: $7,200\nIn this scenario, you have a positive net worth of $75,600. This is a good start in terms of buying a house, but you\u2019ll have to exclude the $28,000 in retirement savings from your home-buying fund because that money is tied up for the long run. Your savings of $52,200, while admirable, amounts to a 20% down payment on a house worth just $261,000, which is well below the average cost of a home in the U.S.\nIn this case, knowing your net worth is helpful because it shows you how much home you can really afford and may encourage you to continue dedicating your savings towards your goal.\nHow To Calculate Your Net Worth\nCalculating your net worth is a three-step process. Although the formula is a simple one, you\u2019ll need the total value of your assets and liabilities to do it.\nNet Worth Formula\nNet Worth = Assets - Liabilities\nFor example, if your total assets equal $600,000 and your total liabilities equal $400,000, your net worth is $200,000.\nStep 1: Calculate Your Assets\nAssets include cash, accounts that hold cash equivalents, and any real estate and personal property you own that could be sold for cash. Here\u2019s how to calculate their value.\n- List how much cash you have on hand.\n- List all your bank and investment accounts and their balances. These are some of the types of accounts you might have:\n- Checking account\n- Savings accounts, including money market\n- Certificate of deposit\n- College savings plan\n- ABLE account\n- Pension (vested portion)\n- Retirement accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s\n- Investment accounts\n- Life insurance and annuities with cash value\n- Next, list any property you own along with an estimate of each item\u2019s resale value. Include:\n- Real estate\n- Vehicles\n- Boats and recreational vehicles\n- Jewelry\n- Antiques\n- Collectibles\n- Electronics\n- Furnishings\n- Sports and hobby equipment\n- Tally up the account balances and the value of your property to get your total assets.\nStep 2: Calculate Your Liabilities\nLiabilities are money you owe, and they include debt and unpaid expenses. Here\u2019s how to calculate them:\n- List your debts and the amount owed on each. Common debts include:\n- Credit card balances\n- Layaway and \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d balances\n- Loan balances, including:\n- Mortgage\n- Home equity, including home equity line of credit\n- Personal\n- Auto\n- Student\n- Cash owed to family and friends\n- Next, list your unpaid bills and the amount due on each, including:\n- Taxes\n- Medical and dental bills\n- Utilities\n- Phone\n- TV/internet\n- Household repairs and improvements\n- Tally up your debts and unpaid bills to get your total liabilities.\nStep 3: Subtract Liabilities From Assets\nOnce you\u2019ve figured out the total value of your assets and the total value of your liabilities, subtract the liabilities from the assets. You\u2019ll see one of three outcomes, as described by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.:\n- Positive net worth: If there\u2019s money left over after you\u2019ve subtracted your liabilities from your assets, you have a positive net worth, meaning you own more than you owe. You can cover all of your liabilities and still have assets to spare.\n- Zero net worth: If subtracting the liabilities brings the value of your assets to $0, you have zero net worth. That means you have enough assets to cover all of your liabilities, but if forced to do that, you\u2019d have nothing left over.\n- Negative net worth: If subtracting liabilities from your assets leaves you with a negative number, you have a negative net worth. That means you owe more than you own \u2014 in other words, your finances are in the red.\nReal-World Scenario\nNow that you have the basics, here\u2019s a look at how you might use the above formula using real-world figures:\nAssets\n- Cash on hand: $2,200\n- Checking account: $3,400\n- Savings account: $9,800\n- CDs and Treasury Bills: $10,000\n- Retirement accounts: $124,000\n- Investment accounts: $23,000\n- Real estate: $340,000\n- Vehicles: $29,000\n- Jewelry: $10,000\n- Furnishings: $22,000\nTotal assets: $573,400\nLiabilities\n- Mortgage: $215,000\n- Personal loan: $5,000\n- Credit card balance: $7,200\n- Auto loans: $18,000\n- Student loans: $42,000\n- Unpaid taxes: $12,500\nTotal liabilities: $299,700\nTotal net worth (assets \u2013 liabilities): $273,700\nHow Can I Increase My Net Worth?\nJust two variables affect net worth: assets and liabilities. So increasing your net worth requires increasing your assets and/or reducing your liabilities.\nOne of the quickest ways to increase net worth is to increase your income and invest the money or use it to purchase assets that increase in value. Working more hours at your current job, if you\u2019re an hourly employee, finding a better-paying job and starting a side hustle are three ways to increase your income.\nKeep in mind that retirement accounts make up the largest percentage of assets (34.1%) held by U.S. households, followed by home equity (28.5%) and stocks and mutual funds (11.9%), according to the most recent Census Bureau report on household wealth. Putting extra income toward retirement savings, a home purchase and securities investments could be an effective strategy for increasing your net worth over time.\nAnother good use of your extra cash is to reduce your liabilities by paying down debt. Credit card debt can be especially damaging to your net worth. Unlike a mortgage loan, which finances an appreciating asset, and student loans for an education likely to result in higher earnings, credit card debt is \u201cbad\u201d debt that typically pays for depreciating assets. So not only do you pay high interest on the items you charge, but you also lose money as the items lose value.\nTracking Net Worth\nTracking net worth can take some effort, but thanks to modern technology, once you do the initial work, it becomes much easier. Although online net worth calculators can do the math for you, if you want to track your net worth on an ongoing basis \u2014 which you should \u2014 consider using an app.\nAn app will keep all of your information and even link to your accounts to update your real-time net worth as it changes from day to day. With only a few minor tweaks or updates, you can keep constant track of your (hopefully growing) net worth.\nPersonal Net Worth vs. Business Net Worth\nIn terms of straight calculation, personal net worth and business net worth are the same. The only real difference is that the types of assets used are a bit different for businesses.\nFor example, both individuals and businesses use things like checking and savings accounts in their net worth equations. But businesses typically have more complicated finances, with assets like real estate and equipment and liabilities like debts owed to vendors, employee payroll and business loans.\nThe computation, however, remains the same: assets \u2013 liabilities = net worth.\nTakeaway\nNet worth tends to increase with age, peaking at $373,900 for Americans ages 70 to 74 before dropping off. But you don\u2019t have to wait years or decades for your net worth to grow. Reducing debt while you focus on saving for retirement and investing in securities and homeownership will put your finances in the green faster and provide you with a safety net to ride out unexpected setbacks.\nFAQ\nHere are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions regarding net worth.- How does credit impact net worth?\n- Credit can impact your net worth significantly. For starters, the more credit card debt you have, the more your net worth is lowered. For example, if you have $10,000 in an investment account and $40,000 in equity in your home but have $52,000 in credit card debt, you actually have a negative net worth. You'll also likely have to pay a higher interest rate on any debt you take out, which will further deplete your cash flow and make it more difficult for you to build your net worth.\n- What is a good net worth?\n- A \"good\" net worth is not an absolute. Depending on your age, income, and lifestyle, a \"good\" net worth can vary dramatically. However, to try to quantify where you should be in your savings, Fidelity Investments recommends the following goals:\n- 1x your salary by age 30\n- 3x by age 40\n- 6x by age 50\n- 8x by age 60\n- 10x by age 67\n- A \"good\" net worth is not an absolute.

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 YearsHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed by Experts\nTrusted by Millions of Readers\nGiven the turbulent economy over the past five years, finding a car that lasts longer than 200,000 miles isn\u2019t a matter of pride \u2014 it\u2019s a financial planning near-necessity. Thankfully, cars last much longer today than they did years ago, but that doesn\u2019t mean that some used cars don\u2019t outperform new models.\nAs Forbes noted, cars from 1970 averaged about 5.7 years and were grounded near the 100,000-mile mark. Today, the average passenger car age is around 12.5 years in the U.S., and many vehicles can last between 200,000 and 300,000 miles. That\u2019s if they\u2019ve been regularly maintained throughout their lifespan.\nAccording to Consumer Reports (CR), \u201cAlmost any car can make it to 200,000 miles and beyond if you spend enough money on it. The better strategy is to start with a model that has proven to be safe, scored high in our road tests, has a strong reliability track record, and has been properly maintained.\u201d\nIf that\u2019s true, why do only 1% of cars built yearly pass the 200,000-mile mark? Certainly, most vehicles die before reaching 200,000 miles because their owners don\u2019t follow maintenance schedules, but some used models are built to last.\nCR recently came out with a list of the 12 most problem-free new cars, minivans, pickup trucks and SUVs most likely to ride past 200,000 miles. Except for the Ford F-150, every entry was a Toyota or Honda.\nSome brands are truly reliable, but when it comes to used cars, it\u2019s better to take iSeeCars\u2019 analysis of over two million cars produced for at least 10 of the last 20 model years into account.\nHere are 10 models that may outlast the average new vehicle, ranked by their highest mileage-achieving cars.\nToyota Sequoia\n- Potential Lifespan: 296,509 miles\nWherever you look, be it Consumer Reports or iSeeCars studies, you\u2019ll find Toyota dominating its reliability rankings. Surprisingly, the Sequoia ranks 1st in iSeeCars rankings and is a good bet to exceed 300,000 miles on the odometer.\nToyota Land Cruiser\n- Potential Lifespan: 280,236 miles\n300,000 miles is a lot for any car, but the Land Cruiser is known for its durability, and getting a used model with 1000,000 to 200,000 miles on it shouldn\u2019t discourage any potential buyer from buying one.\nChevrolet Suburban\nWith the potential of lasting over 265,000 miles, the Suburban is one of the longest-lasting SUVs, more dependable than its rivals the Ford Expedition, Dodge Durango and Jeep Wagoneer.\nToyota Tundra\n- Potential Lifespan: 256,022 miles\nTrucks subjected to heavy use are likely to have structural or mechanical problems when they reach high odometer readings, but this consistently good seller for Toyota enjoys a well-deserved reputation for reliability and durability and can rake upward of 250,000 miles easily.\nGMC Yukon XL\n- Potential Lifespan: 252,360 miles\nRanking fifth overall in iSeeCars\u2019 rankings of the top cars offering the greatest potential lifespan, the Yukon XL can easily last two decades.\nPer MotorBiscuit, owners of the the giant SUV have reported problems with in-car electronics, power equipment, and body integrity, but rarely with the engine, transmission and fuel system performance.\nToyota Prius\n- Potential Lifespan: 250,601 miles\nWhen will people learn? Economical and reliable, the Prius is simply the best compact car on the market and its batteries are \u201calmost invincible,\u201d per MotorBiscuit.\nThe far future might be electric, but the near future is hybrid. CR ranks the Prius No. 1 among all compact cars for reliability, price and customer satisfaction.\nChevrolet Tahoe\n- Potential Lifespan: 250,338 miles\nRepairPal doesn\u2019t rank the Tahoe particularly high in reliability and repair probability (21st out of 26 for midsize SUVs), but the Chevrolet Tahoe is a mileage eater that will outlast many of its competitors in lifetime miles.\nHonda Ridgeline\n- Potential Lifespan: 248,669 miles\n\u201cFor those who want the practicality of a truck and the performance of a car,\u201d a Ridgeline should last up to 300,000 miles with cautious driving and regular maintenance, per HotCars.\nToyota Avalon\n- Potential Lifespan: 245,710 miles\nA used Avalon owner can be assured of at least a decade or more of ownership, per MotorBiscuit.\nDiscontinued in 2022, the durable Avalon consistently ranks as one of the highest-mileage vehicles on the used market.\nToyota Highlander Hybrid\n- Potential Lifespan: 244,994 miles\nThis three-row, midsize crossover SUV is notoriously dependable.\nBarring long-term weather damage, you can expect a Highlander Hybrid to last you at least 300,000 miles and cost you around $489 in annual repair costs per year, according to RepairPal.\nShare This Article:\nYou May Also Like\nThis 1 Simple Change in Your Savings Could Earn You Hundreds Each Year, According to Raisin\nAugust 05, 2025\n5 min Read\nYou'll Never Guess How Much 1 Night in Miami Will Cost You at This Airbnb\nAugust 06, 2025\n5 min Read\nI'm in My 40s and Still Figuring Out How Much I Should Have Saved -- Expert Weighs In\nAugust 05, 2025\n5 min Read\nUnplug These Appliances That Will Hike Up Your Electricity Bill This Fall\nAugust 06, 2025\n5 min Read\nBest Ways To Save Your Money\nMake your money work for you\nGet the latest news on investing, money, and more with our free newsletter.\nThanks!\nSending you timely financial stories that you can bank on.\nSign up for our daily newsletter for the latest financial news and trending topics.\nFor our full Privacy Policy, click here.\nLooks like you're using an adblocker\nPlease disable your adblocker to enjoy the optimal web experience and access the quality content you appreciate from GOBankingRates.\n- AdBlock / uBlock / Brave\n- Click the ad blocker extension icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable on this site\n- Refresh the page\n- Firefox / Edge / DuckDuckGo\n- Click on the icon to the left of the address bar\n- Disable Tracking Protection\n- Refresh the page\n- Ghostery\n- Click the blue ghost icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable Ad-Blocking, Anti-Tracking, and Never-Consent\n- Refresh the page"

      "text": "The No. 1 Way Americans Become Millionaires Is Pretty Boring \u2014 and Easy To Do\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nAbout 18% of Americans are millionaires, translating to roughly 25 million individuals, according to a report by Wealth Management USA. And while there are plenty of ways to accumulate a seven-digit net worth, there are some common avenues.\nMany millionaires start their own business or invest in real estate to earn their riches, while others imply inherit the money. But the number one way that Americans become millionaires is actually within reach of average workers, provided they start early and stick to their plan.\nHere\u2019s the \u201cboring\u201d path to riches that doesn\u2019t involve starting a business, investing in real estate or inheriting the money.\nConsistent Investing\nWant the \u201ceasy\u201d way to a million dollars? Continually invest on a regular basis. According to a report from Morningstar, investors who have $1 million or more in their Fidelity 401(k) accounts consistently invest, typically every two weeks or every month. They don\u2019t trade in and out of aggressive investments, like leveraged ETFs, but instead simply sock away their money on a regular basis into their \u201cboring\u201d investments.\nWhat\u2019s the Secret?\nThere are a number of reasons why consistent investing is the \u201ceasy\u201d path to $1 million. First, regularly adding money to your investments regardless of the market environment ensures that you\u2019ll get an average price. You\u2019ll be buying more stock when prices are low and less when prices are high. You won\u2019t be putting all your money in either at the absolute bottom or at the peak \u2014 but since the long-term trend of the market is up, getting that \u201caverage\u201d price provides a significant return.\nSecond, by consistently investing in \u201cboring\u201d options like mutual funds, 401(k) funds or high-quality stocks, you won\u2019t be taking on excess risk. With automated contributions coming out of your paycheck or bank account, you won\u2019t get tempted to chase the latest investment fad, a mistake that costs many novice investors their entire bankroll. As preservation of capital is half the battle when it comes to building wealth, automatically contributing to relatively \u201cboring\u201d investments can help protect your bankroll over the long run.\nThe third reason why consistent investing works is a simple one. If you continually add money to your account, you\u2019ll have more money in it. If you simply invest $30,000 and watch it grow, you may end up with $60,000, $120,000 or even $240,000 in your account, depending on how long you keep it invested. But if you regularly add $1,000 per month to your account for 40 years, you\u2019ll have contributed $480,000. A simple double of your money over time would be nearly enough to reach that $1 million level.\nHow Does the Math Work?\nHere\u2019s a look at the magic of compounding and how long-term, consistent investing can build real wealth.\nIf you can earn a 10% average annual return on your investments \u2014 which is roughly what the S&P 500 has returned over the long run \u2014 your money will double in slightly over seven years. This makes time a valuable asset in your wealth-building journey. The longer you can keep your money invested, the more you can benefit from the effects of compounding.\nImagine, for example, that you invest $10,000 in the market and earn that 10% average annual return over the following 30 years. At that point, your $10,000 will have grown to $198,374. Without doing anything, your initial investment would have grown by nearly a factor of 20.\nThat\u2019s some impressive growth. But if you continually added even a small amount every month, the math gets much more compelling. Imagine that in addition to your initial $10,000 you add just $360 extra per month or roughly $90 per week. Instead of having close to $200,000 after 30 years, your nest egg will be over $1 million. Adding even $100 per month will still net you about $425,000 or more than double what your initial $10,000 would get you.\nRemember: Consistency Is Key\nAlthough investing can seem complicated, it\u2019s actually not. Although plenty of people will try to sell you on the idea that you need arcane investments like private equity, options or leveraged ETFs to get wealthy, that\u2019s not really true. Consistent investing in something as basic as an S&P 500 index fund can generate seven-figure wealth over the long run, if you stick to the plan and sock away as much as you can on a monthly basis.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nSources\n- Wealth Management USA, \u201cGlobal Wealth Report 2024.\u201d\n- Morningstar, \u201cThe Number One Way Americans are Becoming Millionaires.\u201d"

All factors were then scored and combined, with the lowest score being the best. Factors (2) and (3) weighed 1.5 times, factor (4) weighed 4 times; and factor (5) weighed 0.5 times. To be considered for the HYSA best rates, the product offered had to have an APY above 0.45%. All products and offerings had to be available as of Nov. 1, 2024, to be considered. Rates are subject to change; unless otherwise noted, rates are updated periodically. All other information on accounts is accurate as of Dec. 20, 2024.\nWhat To Know About High-Yield Savings Accounts\nA high-yield savings account offers higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts. This is a win-win for banking customers, as it means they get a better return on their savings and can utilize compound interest to grow their savings faster.\nWhen trying to decide what the best savings product is for your finances, be sure to do your research. High-yield savings are a great option and yield more interest than even certain CD rates. Here\u2019s a closer look to help you choose the best high-yield savings account for you.\nQuick Take: What Is a High-Yield Savings Account?\nIn simple terms, a high-yield savings account is a type of savings account that offers higher-than-average interest rates on deposits. You can find a high-yield savings account at credit unions, as well as at traditional and online banks. Many financial institutions even offer them with varying APY rates that still tend to have significantly higher rates than a traditional savings account.\nPros and Cons of High-Yield Savings Accounts\nHere are a few pros and cons associated with high-yield savings accounts.\nPros\n- Higher yields\n- Compounding daily interest\n- Low, or no, minimum balance requirement\n- No bank fees\n- FDIC-insured to ensure the safety of your money\n- Easy to access if you need the money\nCons\n- Variable interest rates\n- You may be asked to pay a fee after reaching a certain number of withdrawals\n- Not the best method for growing wealth long-term\nHow To Choose a High-Yield Savings Account\nConsider these when determining which high-yield savings account to open:\n- Higher than average APY\n- No bank fees\n- Zero recurring fees\n- Ease in accessing the money\n- Make sure the financial institution of your choice is FDIC-insured\nHere are some steps you can take to help you choose the right high-yield savings account:\n1. Figure Out if High-Yield Savings Are Right For You\nWhen you open a federally insured high-yield savings account and put a specific sum of money in it, this money can grow. This is because of the annual percentage yield.\nEssentially, the higher the APY on a savings account, the faster the money saved in this account grows. The daily impact of compounding interest means banking customers may reach financial goals much faster than if they saved their money in a traditional savings account.\n2. Calculate Your Potential Compound Interest\nBecause of daily compounding interest, opening a high-yield savings account means you can reach your financial goals and save money much faster than you would in many other types of accounts. Compound interest plays an especially important role in growing your savings. With many Americans living paycheck-to-paycheck, it could be one way to keep your finances in check.\n3. Factor In the Fees and Minimums\nThese will vary depending on your financial institution. It\u2019s always a good idea to do a bit of research when reviewing high-yield savings accounts at credit unions or banks and to determine which fees or minimum balance requirements you may need to adhere to as a customer.\n4. Put Your Savings in a Safe Place\nAccording to the Federal Reserve, the general answer is yes, if the high-yield savings account is FDIC-insured. The variable rates do mean the interest may go up or down a bit, but the overall financial product itself is safe.\nAlternatives to High-Yield Savings Accounts\nLet\u2019s compare and contrast various types of accounts to high-yield savings accounts.\nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Traditional Savings Accounts\nThe most notable difference between high-yield savings accounts and traditional savings accounts, or standard savings accounts, is their higher yields. In many cases, the average interest rate for a high-yield savings account can be up to 10 times \u2014 or greater! \u2014 the average rate of a standard savings account.\nHigh-Yield Savings Accounts vs. Checking Accounts\nThe overall functions of a checking account and a high-yield savings account tend to occupy different spaces in one\u2019s financial journey. A checking account earns much less interest than a high-yield savings account. A checking account is a good choice for those who need to make everyday transactions, like paying bills or buying essential items. A high-yield savings account is ideal for those saving money to reach a financial goal, as their savings will quickly earn interest that way.\nHigh-Yield Savings Accounts vs. Money Market Accounts\nMoney market accounts share similarities with high-yield savings accounts. Both accounts are FDIC-insured and have higher yields than a traditional savings account.\nOne of the biggest differences, however, is the minimum balance requirement. Many high-yield savings accounts have low, or no, minimum balance requirements. A money market account\u2019s minimum balance requirement may be as low as a few hundred dollars or several thousand dollars. It is possible to find a money market account with a lower minimum balance requirement, so it\u2019s advised that banking customers do their due diligence to determine their options.\nHigh-Yield Savings Accounts vs. CDs\nIf the fluctuating nature of high-yield savings account interest rates does not appeal to you, you may consider a certificate of deposit, or CD.\nA CD allows you to lock in an interest rate for a term period, which can be a few months or several years. High-yield savings accounts have variable rates, which may change and cannot be locked in like a CD.\nHigh-Yield Savings Accounts vs. Investing\nRegardless of how much higher than average the APY is on a high-yield savings account, it is not generally recommended to open a high-yield savings account in lieu of investing. While investing does come with risks, investments carry a higher rate of potential long-term returns. Connect with a financial professional to determine which you should prioritize and ask additional questions.\nHigh-Yield Savings Accounts vs. Money Market Funds\nWhile both high-yield savings accounts and money market funds allow you to quickly build short-term savings, there are several differences between the two to consider. Money market funds differ from high-yield savings accounts in that they may offer even more substantial interest rates.\nHowever, one of the biggest differences pertains to FDIC insurance. High-yield savings accounts are FDIC-insured and money market funds are not, though they are considered low-risk investments.\nHigh-Yield Savings Accounts vs. Roth IRAs\nThe biggest difference between a high-yield savings account and a Roth IRA is that the former is used to save money temporarily. A Roth IRA is a retirement account and is treated with long-term investing in mind.\nHow To Open a High-Yield Savings Account\nIf you\u2019re ready to open a high-yield savings account, you\u2019ll need to obtain the following items before getting started.\n- Identification: You must be able to provide a government-issued ID, such as a driver\u2019s license, state-issued ID or passport, with your legal name and birth date. You will also be asked for your Social Security number or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.\n- Personal information: Additional necessary information to provide includes your home address, home phone number and email address.\n- Minimum deposit: If there is a minimum deposit required to open a high-yield savings account, you will need to pay this amount to fund the account. Depending on your financial institution, you may be able to pay using the routing and account numbers for a separate bank account, a debit card or a money order.\n- Application: Fill out the appropriate application to open a high-yield savings account. You may do this in person at a financial institution branch location, over the phone or online.\nInterest Rates on High-Yield Savings Accounts\nIf you\u2019ve been wondering how interest works on a high-yield savings account look no further. A high-yield savings account utilizes compound interest to grow its savings. This means you earn interest on the principal balance and the interest the balance earns. As these rates are variable, they are subject to fluctuating with market conditions and can go up and down.\nFAQ\nHere are some common questions and answers about high-yield savings accounts.- How do high-yield savings accounts work?\n- A high-yield savings account is a savings product where you put a specific sum of money in it so that money can grow faster than it would in a traditional savings account due to the higher APY. HYSAs can be found at traditional banks, credit unions and online banks, with high interest online savings offerings available. Daily compounding interest means banking customers may reach financial goals much faster than if they saved their money in a traditional savings account.\n- Are high-yield savings accounts safe?\n- Yes, if the high-yield savings account is FDIC-insured your money is protected up to $250,000. The variable rates do mean the interest may go up or down a bit, but the overall financial product itself is safe.\n- Who has the highest-paying high-yield savings account?\n- Review GOBankingRates' Best Banks list to find out which financial institutions offer the best high-yield savings accounts in 2025.\n- Do you pay taxes on high-yield savings account earnings?\n- Yes. After earning more than $10 in interest, you will receive Form 1099-INT, Interest Income from the IRS as you file your federal taxes.\n- What are the best uses for a high-yield savings account?\n- High-yield savings are a great way to grow your money over time to help you with your long-term savings goals such as saving for a down payment for a new house or your general retirement plans.\nMore Resources for Banking\nBest Banks\nSavings Accounts\nCD Account Rates\nMoney Market Accounts"

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nThe total amount of money in the world can be measured and expressed in many different ways, so it\u2019s difficult to give a specific answer.\nIf you\u2019re curious about the total value of notes and coins in circulation, the Bank for International Settlements estimated it to be $8,275,000,000,000, or $8.28 trillion U.S. dollars, across 20 major countries plus the euro area in 2021, its most recent estimate.\nOf course, there are nearly 200 countries in the world, so this is just a rough estimate of the most narrowly defined \u2014 and perhaps easiest to quantify \u2014 category of money.\nHow Money Is Categorized\nEconomists divide money into categories based primarily on how liquid it is, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.\nThe range starts at the narrowest and most liquid with M0 and, in the U.S., goes up to the broadest and least liquid, M3. Each M level includes the levels that precede it, so M3 includes M0, M1 and M2.\nThe central bank in the U.S. is the Federal Reserve System, which publishes U.S. currency data based on three of the four Ms:\nHow Money Supply Is Measured\n- M0: Referred to as the monetary base, M0 includes all the money in circulation, including money banks hold in reserve. According to the Federal Reserve\u2019s data for September 2024, there was about $2.3 trillion in circulation.\n- M1: It includes all the M0 money supply, plus the money held in travelers\u2019 checks, demand deposits, other types of checkable deposits and negotiable orders of withdrawal. As of September 2024, the seasonally adjusted stock of M1 totaled $18.15 trillion.\n- M2: It includes all of the currency from the M1 money supply, and expands to include mutual funds, CDs, money market securities and other types of time deposits. The total stock of M2 was $21.22 trillion in September.\n- M3: It includes all the elements of M2, plus the money of large institutions. As compared to M1 and M2, M3 assets have the lowest liquidity. The Fed no longer calculates M3.\nGross Domestic Product\nAnother way to view global wealth is by gross domestic product, or GDP, which is the total value of all the goods and services produced and purchased within a given country over the course of a year or other time period.\nWhile GDP measures a nation\u2019s production and tracks its economy\u2019s growth or contraction, the International Monetary Fund notes that GDP has a number of shortcomings, including its failure to measure residents\u2019 standards of living and well-being. One reason is the disparity in GDP distribution \u2014 a country\u2019s residents don\u2019t benefit equally from GDP growth.\nHuman Development Index\nThe Human Development Index adds context to the GDP and money supply by measuring countries\u2019 longevity and education as well as their income. According to the United Nations Development Programme, the HDI acknowledges that longevity and education are as important to a country\u2019s development as its economic factors.\nWhere the economic factor is concerned, the HDI measures gross national income, or GDI, instead of GDP because GNI represents what residents earn rather than the value of what they produce.\nIn 2023, the global gross national income totaled $105.7 trillion, according to the World Bank Group. But just as GDP fails to reflect disparities in the benefits of production, GNI doesn\u2019t reflect income inequality, which is why it\u2019s important to view the figures in the context of the other factors.\nHow Much Money Is There Per Person in the World?\nEstimates of how much money there is per person in the world vary widely because of the several different ways to measure it.\nUsing the Federal Reserve\u2019s $2.3 trillion M0 currency figure and a current world population of 8.17 billion, per Worldometer, there\u2019s about $282 per person in the world, on average. Using the M1 figure, the amount is $2,221. Using the M2 figure, the amount per person is $2,597.\nHowever, not all estimates include every country or every person, and the figures vary widely based on whether they represent average or median wealth.\nFor example, UBS Wealth Management publishes an annual Global Wealth Report. The 2023 report, which is the most recent containing a global net private wealth estimate, put the average figure at $84,718, but it only counted adults, and it only used figures for the 60 countries with the highest total wealth.\nIn a report on that data, Visual Capitalist also provided the median amount per adult \u2014 $8,654.\nAs with GDP and GNI, global estimates don\u2019t reflect the enormous disparities in wealth from one country to the next, or from one individual to the next within a given country.\nFAQ\nHere are more answers to questions about money and currency in the world today.- How much physical cash exists in the world?\n- The Bank for International Settlements estimates that there are $8,275,000,000,000, or $8.28 trillion U.S. dollars, across 20 major countries plus the euro area in 2021, its most recent estimate.\n- What is the difference between money supply and total wealth?\n- Money supply refers to cash while wealth include assets that aren't literally money.\n- Is cryptocurrency included in the global money count?\n- It depends on who is counting. The total market cap of cryptocurrency, as reported by CoinMarketCap, is $3.29 trillion as of May 2025.\nAmber Barkley, Elizabeth Constantineau and Daria Uhlig contributed to the reporting for this article.\nOur in-house research team and on-site financial experts work together to create content that\u2019s accurate, impartial, and up to date.

      "text": "Why Work Doesn\u2019t Build Wealth Alone, but These 5 Strategies Do\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nAlthough an active income is one part of your financial picture, working alone won\u2019t build wealth. If you want to build wealth, you\u2019ll likely need to look beyond your day job.\nExplore the following strategies to help you build wealth going forward.\nGo Beyond Saving\nEveryone knows that saving money is important. But just letting your savings collect a pittance of interest in a traditional savings account won\u2019t propel you to a brighter financial future.\n\u201cWhile saving is a necessary condition for accumulating wealth, it is not a sufficient one,\u201d said Robert R. Johnson, Ph.D., charted financial analyst (CFA), chartered alternative investment analyst (CAIA), and professor of finance at Creighton University.\n\u201cPeople need to both save AND invest. I see many people who are actually pretty good at saving via 401(k) plans and IRAs, yet don\u2019t provide themselves sufficient funds to retire, because they didn\u2019t prudently take risks with those funds.\u201d\nIf you are looking for a place to start your investment portfolio, getting familiar with low-cost index funds is a good place to start.\nTake Advantage of Compounding\nInvesting at all is great, but investing money early in your life is even better. When you invest early, you give yourself a chance to reap the benefits of compounding.\n\u201cThe surest way to build true long-term wealth is to invest in the stock market,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cMistakes begin early in life and the biggest financial mistake people make is taking too little risk, not too much risk. In fact, a UBS study showed that millennials and the World War II generation have similar asset allocations \u2014 low allocations to equities and inordinately high allocations to cash.\n\u201cBoth generations were shaped by cataclysmic financial events in their formative years \u2014 the WWII generation with the Great Depression and millennials with the financial crisis. Millennials need to begin compounding early, and let that compounding work its patient magic over decades.\u201d\nDon\u2019t let fear hold you back from putting your funds to work.\nAvoid Timing The Market\nIt\u2019s tempting to try to buy low and sell high. But it\u2019s almost impossible for the average investor to accurately predict the rise and fall of the market.\n\u201cMany people think that they can avoid market declines by moving in and out of the market,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cA mistake many investors make is attempting to time the market. Attempting to time the market is \u2018fools gold.'\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cThe best way to counteract this tendency is to practice dollar cost averaging in a broad based stock market mutual fund or ETF \u2014 like one that tracks the S&P 500. That means you are consistently buying into the market whether it has headed up, down or sideways.\u201d\nBe Intentional With Your Income\nIf you are working a W-2 job, a little bit of intentionality can go a long way when it comes to making the most of your compensation.\n\u201cThe easiest way to build wealth is to tweak your outlook on W-2 income,\u201d said Robert Persichitte, CPA, certified financial planner (CFP), CFE and affiliate professor at the Metropolitan State University of Denver.\n\u201cFind tax-efficient, cost-effective ways to build wealth on auto-pilot. For most people, the best way to do that is to max out your employer\u2019s plan (401k, 403b, etc.). Don\u2019t stop at the employer match. Set a goal to hit the maximum ($23,500 for 2025).\u201d\nFocus On Your Financial Education\nIt can be difficult to build wealth if you don\u2019t understand the mechanics of your finances. Since most of us don\u2019t learn about money in school, making an investment in our financial education should be a top priority for many.\nFor example, you might listen to a podcast or read a book about managing your finances to get you started down the right path. A few worthwhile personal finance books include \u201cThe Automatic Millionaire and Think and Grow Rich.\u201d\nAs you beef up your financial education, you\u2019ll likely grow more comfortable making money decisions that set you up for the future. Generally, more knowledge might help you put more focus on investing for tomorrow than just spending for today.\nBuild Passive Income Streams\nAt some point in your financial journey, the goal becomes earning money without sacrificing your time. If you only trade your time for money, it can be difficult to grow your wealth. Instead, you need to put your money to work for you.\nFor most, investing in stocks is one baseline investment that generates income. But the wealthy often look beyond this entry-level point to create other passive income streams.\nFor example, you might build a business that generates income through the input of your team or create an asset that generates royalties over the long-term.\nThe Bottom Line\nGenerally, building wealth boils down to working smarter instead of working harder. Although your day job\u2019s income is a useful tool, it\u2019s what you do with that income that sets up your financial future.\nIf you don\u2019t tuck anything into investments or spend time building other income streams, you\u2019ll always rely on your active income to make ends meet. Break the cycle by looking toward the future and making decisions about your money with a long-term vision."

Whether you have just started investing or have been consistently adding to your retirement accounts, how you reach your short-term or long-term financial goals has many paths.\nFinancial advisors have an array of methods you should try such as developing passive income streams, diversifying your investment portfolio or even moving your savings to where you can earn the highest interest rates. No matter what financial advice you take, determining when you reach financial freedom will feel differently depending on your ultimate goals.\nHere are seven key signs that indicate you\u2019ve reached financial freedom and how you can recognize them when you do.\nYou Live Comfortably Within Your Means\nLiving within or beneath your means is the bedrock of financial freedom. This doesn\u2019t imply scrimping and saving but rather spending wisely in alignment with your income or when your income increases. When you\u2019re financially free, your lifestyle doesn\u2019t strain your finances.\nYou can comfortably afford your living expenses and occasional luxuries and still have money left over without surviving paycheck to paycheck. This balance is a clear sign that you\u2019re financially comfortable and managing your resources effectively.\nYou Have No High-Interest Debt\nHigh-interest debt, like credit card balances, can be a major obstacle on the road to financial freedom, especially when it can so easily spiral.\nIf you\u2019ve reached a point where you\u2019re not necessarily debt-free but free from paying high interest, it\u2019s a significant milestone. It indicates not only that you\u2019ve managed past debts well, but also that you\u2019re likely making prudent financial decisions to avoid future high-interest liabilities.\nYou Have a Robust Emergency Fund\nAn emergency fund is your financial safety net, designed to cover unexpected expenses or financial shocks like medical emergencies or job loss.\nHaving a substantial emergency fund that can cover several months of living expenses is a clear indicator of financial freedom. It means you\u2019re prepared for life\u2019s uncertainties and can handle a multitude of financial scenarios without derailing your stability or spiraling into debt.\nYour Investments Are Growing\nInvestment growth is a clear sign of financial health. Not putting all of your nest egg investments in one basket and diversifying also helps advance your wealth. If your investments are consistently growing, it\u2019s evidence that you\u2019re not only saving money but also multiplying it.\nThis growth could come from stocks, bonds, real estate or other alternative investment vehicles. It\u2019s not just about the amount invested, but also sticking to your investment strategy to reach the full potential of your financial plan.\nYou\u2019re on Track for a Comfortable Retirement\nPlanning for retirement is a critical component of financial freedom as many estimates say you need at least $1 million to comfortably retire in many states. If you have a solid retirement plan in place and are consistently contributing to it (and matching employer contributions), you\u2019re likely on the path to financial independence.\nThis doesn\u2019t just mean putting money away but having a strategic plan that ensures you\u2019ll have enough to live comfortably in your later years.\nYou Achieve Financial Goals You Set\nSetting and achieving financial goals is a telltale sign of financial freedom. These goals can vary, from buying a home to funding your children\u2019s education or even traveling the world. Achieving these goals indicates not only financial capability but also the presence of a disciplined approach to financial planning.\nMoney Is a Tool, Not a Stress Factor\nFinally, the most profound sign of financial freedom is the psychological aspect. When money becomes a tool for achieving your goals rather than a source of stress, you\u2019ve reached a state of financial serenity.\nIn this state, financial decisions are driven by goals and values, not by fear or necessity.\nFinal Take To GO\nThe bottom line is that financial freedom is about more than just accumulating wealth; it\u2019s about achieving a state of mental well-being about where and how your money works for you and not the other way around.\nIt\u2019s a journey that requires discipline, planning and more than a little bit of financial savvy. Recognizing when you achieved this money milestone signifies not just where you are, but also how far you\u2019ve come.\nMore From GOBankingRates"

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nThere\u2019s plenty of advice out there for what to do with your money, but it\u2019s just as important to know what not to do with it. In today\u2019s uncertain economy, avoiding common financial pitfalls can make a big difference.\nIn a recent Instagram post, personal finance expert Humphrey Yang broke down the three things he never does with his money \u2014 that you shouldn\u2019t either.\nLend It to Friends or Family\nWhen a friend or family member asks to borrow money, you may feel a sense of obligation to do it \u2014 but Yang said to think twice before you get money involved in your relationship.\n\u201cThis can get messy, awkward and strain your relationships,\u201d he said.\nInstead of lending someone close to you money, offer to give an amount you are comfortable with as a gift. For example, if a friend is asking to borrow $500, offer to give them $50 \u201cand call it a day,\u201d Yang said.\n\u201cYes, it still sucks to part ways with your money, but at least you are helping your friend in need,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may not love it, but it\u2019s better than completely shutting them out.\u201d\nPut It in Low-Interest Bank Accounts\nBefore putting your money in a savings or checking account, do some comparison shopping to see which bank offers the best interest rate. As Yang noted, this typically won\u2019t be one of the major national bank chains.\n\u201cThese big banks never pay any interest,\u201d he said. \u201cMove funds you don\u2019t need to touch immediately to a high-yield account.\u201d\nSpend It on Depreciating Items\nYang said to think carefully before making any major purchase to determine if it\u2019s really worth the cost.\n\u201cI would never spend [money] on something that depreciates rapidly without adding real value to my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about things like expensive cars that lose 20% of their value the moment you drive them off the lot, designer items bought just for status or the latest gadgets that\u2019ll be outdated in six months.\u201d\nBefore making a big purchase, Yang recommended asking, \u201cWill this genuinely improve my life or help me earn more money?\u201d If not, you shouldn\u2019t buy it."

He explains that net worth, calculated as assets minus liabilities, provides a clear picture of financial health, while a higher savings rate accelerates the path to financial freedom. Seo encourages regular monitoring of these numbers to motivate smarter financial decisions and suggests reallocating funds from traditional savings to investments for better growth.",
