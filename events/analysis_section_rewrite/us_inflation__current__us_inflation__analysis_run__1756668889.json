      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Remove all SPX/Equity‑index references** – the Section Focus is on the Fed’s core PCE gauge and its near‑term policy implications, not on the S&P 500. Delete any sentences that mention SPX, Nasdaq, or equity performance (e.g., “The S&P 500 (SPX) is poised…”, “the index would rise 1–3 %”, “Marvell and Dell…”).  \n2. **Re‑frame the narrative around the core PCE reading** – start with the July core PCE at 2.6% (ID: U21K4ALYQ/ZUXOHE4Q9) and explain how this sits above the Fed’s 2 % target but below the 2.9% threshold that would dampen cut expectations.  \n3. **Highlight the Fed’s dovish signal** – cite Powell’s hint of a 25‑bp cut (ID: U21K4ALYQ) and quantify the market‑based probability (≈85 % per FedWatch).  \n4. **Link to UST 10‑year yield** – state that a cut would likely flatten the curve, pushing the 10‑y yield down 5–10 bp, while a higher PCE or political uncertainty could push it up 5–15 bp.  \n5. **Include the political catalyst** – reference the Cook removal lawsuit (ID: GXYXMKIG5) and note that a court block would reinforce Fed credibility, supporting the cut narrative; a successful removal would raise long‑term yields by 5–10 bp.  \n6. **Add a short‑term catalyst window** – the next core PCE release (mid‑September) and the Fed’s September FOMC minutes (late‑September) are the key windows.  \n7. **Quantify upside/downside** – if the Fed cuts, expect UST 10‑y to fall 5–10 bp and term premium to compress 3–5 bp; if PCE rises >2.9 % or political risk materializes, expect yields to rise 5–15 bp and term premium to widen 3–6 bp.  \n8. **Remove all non‑relevant content** (tariff discussion, tech earnings, Cracker Barrel, Tesla lawsuit) – these do not map to the required canonical handles for the focus.  \n\nAfter these edits, the piece should read as a concise, data‑driven view on the Fed’s core PCE gauge, its policy implications, and the near‑term catalyst window, fully aligned with the Section Focus.",
