  "content": "\u2022 The Trump administration is threatening to sue and withhold federal funds from more than 20 \"sanctuary\" states, cities and counties, because of their lack of cooperation with ICE.\n\u2022 The new list, released Aug. 5 by the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Public Affairs, includes three states and one city in New England: Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and Boston, MA.\n\u2022 Under the Trust Act, Boston city law enforcement officials are prohibited from cooperating with ICE to carry out civil warrants.\n\nThe Trump administration is threatening to sue and withhold federal funds from more than 20 \"sanctuary\" states, cities and counties, because of their lack of cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.\n\nThe new list, released Aug. 5 by the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Public Affairs, includes three states and one city in New England: Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n\"Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"The Department of Justice will continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.\"\n\nInclusion on the list comes with the explicit threat of lawsuits and federal funding halts. And border czar Tom Homan has previously promised to \"flood\" those jurisdictions with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. In February, he said he would be \"bringing hell\" to Boston.\n\nSeveral federal judges have blocked the administration's previous efforts to punish some of those jurisdictions, including Chicago and Portland, Oregon.\n\nEarlier this year, the White House published and then almost immediately withdrew a significantly longer list after many communities on the list said they were erroneously included. In many of the jurisdictions included on the new list, including Boston, local leaders have argued that allowing police to partner with ICE discourages crime victims and witnesses from coming forward regardless of their immigration status.\n\nIn announcing the new list, which also includes both New York City and the state of New York, Chicago and San Francisco, the White House highlighted how Louisville, Kentucky, had agreed to end sanctuary policies while facing threat of a lawsuit.\n\nThere's no specific legal definition of a sanctuary jurisdiction, but Bondi's office said it considered things like failure to collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, providing government benefits to undocumented immigrants, or refusing to share immigration information about jail detainees.\n\nFederal courts are currently weighing several lawsuits brought by the Trump administration against jurisdictions on the sanctuary list. A federal judge last month threw out the Trump administration's sanctuary jurisdiction lawsuit against Chicago and surrounding Cook County.\n\nUnder the Trust Act, Boston city law enforcement officials are prohibited from cooperating with ICE to carry out civil warrants. The 2014 law makes many characterize Boston as a sanctuary city, though Boston Mayor Michelle Wu's administration doesn't use the term. Boston police officers work with immigration officials only on criminal warrants.\n\n\u201cWhenever someone commits a crime, whenever there\u2019s a criminal warrant, we hold them accountable,\u201d Wu said during a March hearing in front of Congress. \u201cIf ICE deems that they are dangerous enough to obtain a criminal warrant, we hold them accountable.\u201d\n\nDuring that hearing, Wu touted the city's safety record and pushed back against \"the false narrative\" that all immigrants are criminals.\n\n\u201cThe false narrative is that immigrants in general are criminals, or immigrants in general cause all sorts of danger and harm, that is actually what is undermining safety in our communities,\u201d Wu said.\n\nMassachusetts was named on the original list of sanctuary states released in May, but it wasn't included this time. MA Gov. Maura Healey has said several times the Massachusetts isn't a sanctuary state.\n\nWhich communities have been described as immigrant 'sanctuaries'?\n\nAccording to the Department of Justice, the following communities are offering \"sanctuary\" to immigrants who lack the legal right to be in this country.\n\nUnited States Attorney General Pam Bondi has said the list could change as cities, counties or states changed policies in the future.",

      "text": "Judge blocks Trump from withholding funds from 16 'sanctuary' cities, counties\nApril 24 (Reuters) - A federal judge in San Francisco on Thursday blocked Donald Trump's administration from withholding federal funding from several so-called sanctuary jurisdictions that have declined to cooperate with the Republican president's hardline immigration crackdown.\nU.S. District Judge William Orrick issued the injunction at the request of 16 cities and counties nationally led by San Francisco that in a lawsuit filed in February argued that the administration was unlawfully trying to force local officials to cooperate with federal immigration arrests.\nThose jurisdictions include the cities of Minneapolis, New Haven, Portland, St. Paul, Santa Fe and Seattle. They argue that the administration is seeking to punish them for exercising their rights to limit the use of their resources for federal civil immigration enforcement.\nThe lawsuit challenged an executive order Trump signed that threatened to cut off federal funding to sanctuary jurisdictions that limit or refuse to cooperate with federal immigration law enforcement, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nThe localities sued a day after the U.S. Department of Justice sued the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago, seeking a court order blocking so-called sanctuary laws that the Democratic-led jurisdictions adopted that it said were interfering with Trump's agenda.\nSanctuary laws prevent state and local law enforcement from assisting federal civil immigration officers.\nThe Justice Department has since then also filed a lawsuit challenging a New York law that bars the Democratic-led state from sharing vehicle and address information with federal immigration authorities."

      "text": "Why is Massachusetts considered a \"sanctuary state\" by some, when Gov. Healey says it's not?\nMassachusetts is home to eight sanctuary cities. They have a combined population of one million. Boston is the largest of the sanctuary cities.\nBut at a time when sanctuary cities and states are getting hammered by the Trump administration, Governor Maura Healey has made it a point to say Massachusetts is not a \"sanctuary state.\"\nGovernor Healey told WBZ's John Keller in December: \"We are not a sanctuary state.\"\nIn January she said, \"We follow the rules. We are not a sanctuary state.\"\nLast week, and then again Wednesday, Healey told reporters the same exact thing: \"Massachusetts is not a sanctuary state.\"\nWhat is a sanctuary state?\nIs she right? Well, we asked the governor \"What is your definition of a sanctuary state?\"\nHealey responded, \"I would leave that to others who call themselves that to define, but Massachusetts isn't and as I say we continue to work regularly local, state and federal law enforcement when it comes to public safety.\"\nIn reality, there is no universally agreed upon definition of a \"sanctuary state.\" You won't find the specific term in any Massachusetts laws. But, in many news stories, from The New York Times to Fox News, you will find Massachusetts listed as a sanctuary state with a dozen or so other states.\nThe Center for Immigration Studies lists Massachusetts as sanctuary state along with California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and Washington. That list is often used as a source in news articles on this topic.\nSo, why is Massachusetts considered a sanctuary state by some, especially when the others say it's not?\nWell, it's rare for a state to declare itself as a sanctuary, though Oregon declared it in 1987, and California's Governor has said his state is a sanctuary state in social media posts. Instead, it's more about a few particular laws and policies that these states have in common.\nMost states given the \"sanctuary\" distinction have rules limiting how local and state law enforcement interact with Immigration and Customs Enforcement- or ICE. Most of these states have rules prohibiting state authorities for arresting people solely on their immigration status and - this is an important one, limit how sheriff departments treat detainer requests from ICE.\nMassachusetts law on ICE detainers\nIn 2017, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in a case called Lunn v. Commonwealth that, \"Massachusetts law provides no authority for Massachusetts court officers to arrest and hold an individual solely on the basis of a Federal civil immigration detainer, beyond the time that the individual would otherwise be entitled to be released from State custody.\"\nThat means sheriff's departments are unable to hold someone after they post bail, even if they are wanted by ICE.\nWBZ's Louisa Moller recently spotlighted how sheriffs who want to cooperate with ICE say their hands are tied.\n\"It's very frustrating for me to know I might have a drug trafficker or a violent offender getting bailed out of here. I call ICE and they're like, we're very busy with a couple situations, we can't get there for a few hours. I can't hold them right now,\" said Worcester County Sheriff Lewis Evangelidis.\nWe asked Republican State Senator Peter Durant of Worcester, a vocal critic of some of Governor Healey's immigration policies, if he considers Massachusetts a sanctuary state. Durant told us, \"If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it just may be a duck, and Massachusetts certainly looks and acts like a sanctuary state.\"\nStill, Governor Healey holds firm saying, \"Massachusetts is a state that works with federal law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting crime and criminals. It's been the case it will continue to be the case. Our Department of Corrections, for example, regularly contacts ICE when we have an inmate who has an immigration detainer out there. We work with ICE on making sure that person is transferred to ICE. So that's the way it has worked. That's the way it will continue to work. We are not a sanctuary.\"\nIf you have a question you'd like us to look into, please email questioneverything@cbsboston.com."

The Executive Order recognized that \u201csome State and local officials . . . continue to use their authority to violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws\u201d and \u201c[i]t is imperative that the Federal Government restore the enforcement of United States law.\u201d The Executive Order directed the Justice Department, in collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security, to publish a list of such jurisdictions.

People will call you out,\" she said. \"So you have to show up everywhere and keep working.\"\nWhat Michelle Wu said about sanctuary cities, testifying before Congress on 'The Daily Show'\nWith the recent spotlight on Boston's status as a sanctuary city, Chieng asked Wu about testifying before Congress on the issue.\n\"If people are afraid to drop their kids off at school, or call 911 when they need help, or share information when they actually have information to report about a crime that happened, that makes everyone less safe, whether or not you are an immigrant, whether or not you're here in this country six generations or just arrived,\" she said.\nWu added that the criticism that sanctuary cities are more dangerous is \"a false narrative.\"\n\"We know that in our city, where our immigrant communities are entrepreneurs, are holding up our health \u2212 the best hospitals in the country, the universities and jobs that we all rely on,\" she said. \"And in order to make sure that we can keep that progress going, everyone has to feel part of it.\"\nWu on the hardest part of being Boston's mayor: 'People have a lot to say'\nWhen asked about the hardest aspect of her job, Wu said it's \"that people have a lot to say.\"\n\"Everyone's voice has a place in our community,\" she said. \"And when you have so many decisions that come after a long history, also, of being a place where, for 400 years, people have stood up for the right thing, fought hard to make a difference, finding that consensus is complicated.\"\nWu also said Boston \"is a very passionate city.\"\n\"We cheer hard for our sports teams. And people look at politics, and government, and being involved in the community the same way,\" she said. \"And it's pretty hard to make the greatest city on earth even better, but we are working every day.\"\nMelina Khan is a trending reporter for the USA TODAY Network - New England, which serves more than a dozen affiliated publications across New England.

      "text": "'Flood' of ICE agents is coming to cities run by Democrats, White House warns\nMigrant-rights groups worry that harsher enforcement will lead to more civil rights violations and prompt community pushback.\nWhite House border czar Tom Homan is promising to \"flood\" cities run by Democrats with immigration agents, as the Trump administration ramps up border enforcement.\nCongress earlier this month gave the Trump administration more than $170 billion over the next four years to dramatically scale up enforcement, detention and deportation, and Homan said Americans living in so-called \"sanctuary cities\" can expect to see far more agents on the street soon.\n\"We're going to flood the zone,\" Homan said at a July 21 press conference. \"Sanctuary cities get exactly what they don't want: more agents in the community and more agents in the work site. When we arrest (a suspected illegal immigrant) in the community, if he's with others that are in the country illegally, they're coming too.\"\nSanctuary cities won't help with ICE arrests\nThe White House has repeatedly singled out cities from Los Angeles to Denver to Boston for their refusal to assist ICE agents making detentions, and Homan has threatened to arrest elected officials who stymie the president.\nMigrant-rights groups warn increased enforcement raises the risk of more civil rights violations and violent confrontations, like the chaotic protests that broke out in Los Angeles last month following Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids at a Home Depot, among other locations.\nHoman spoke in New York City after an off-duty Border Patrol agent was injured during an attempted robbery that officials say was committed by an undocumented immigrant. Homan and other White House officials argue the agent would never have been hurt if his alleged assailant had previously been blocked from entering the country or deported.\nTrump officials have long complained that many cities run by Democrats refuse to honor requests to detain people on behalf of ICE in local jails, and Homan said doing so makes it harder for ICE to arrest \"bad guys\" in the safety of a detention center. He said making street arrests is more dangerous for everyone, requiring more personnel to operate safely.\nFederal officials say there's been an 800% increase in assaults against immigration agents, although they have declined to release comprehensive data. Last month, Trump deployed the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to help protect federal buildings and assist ICE agents in making detentions, a move that temporarily escalated tensions.\nICE has conducted immigration enforcement actions around the country, but it's yet to focus a sustained effort in any particular sanctuary city outside of the Los Angeles area.\nBudget balloons for immigrant arrests and detentions\nThe federal spending plan, among other things, provides funding for 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to help carry out Trump's plan to deport 1 million people annually.\nTrump won the White House after campaigning on a platform that included dramatically stricter immigration enforcement and border controls, and the federal funding plan he signed July 4 provides money to dramatically expand the number of ICE agents on the streets, $45 billion for more than 100,000 new detention beds for people facing deportation, $46.6 billion for border wall construction and $10 billion in additional Homeland Security funding.\nICE now has a bigger budget than the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Prisons combined, according to an analysis by the American Immigration Council.\nPublic has begun pushing back against Trump's immigration policies\nThe increased funding for one of Trump's signature policies comes as the American public appears to be growing increasingly concerned about the tactics being deployed. A July 20 poll by CBS/YouGov found that 56% of Americans disapproved of the president's immigration measures, while 44% approved, a 10-point drop from February.\nWhile Trump and Homan argue that anyone living illegally in the United States is by definition a criminal, federal statistics show that only about 36% of current ICE detainees have ever been convicted of a crime, while 31% have pending criminal charges and the remaining 33% are facing just immigration violations, according to analysis by Austin Kocher, a Syracuse University research assistant professor who tracks ICE data.\nThe nonprofit American Immigration Council criticized the massive funding expansion, which came without any fundamental reform to the nation's immigration process. Many immigrants living in the United States entered under policies that were legal at the time, or have been waiting years for the chance to apply for citizenship.\n\u201cThrowing billions at detention centers and enforcement agents is short-sighted. Instead, we should be investing in a system aimed at welcoming immigrants that contribute billions to our economy,\u201d said Adriel Orozco, senior policy counsel at the American Immigration Council. \u201cWe don\u2019t need more jail beds and indiscriminate raids. We need balanced solutions that strengthen due process and keep families together.\u201d"

      "text": "Trump administration sues Illinois, Chicago for obstructing ICE efforts\nTrump administration officials are suing Illinois and top state officials, hoping to force them to turn over suspected illegal immigrants rather than releasing them from jails and state prisons.\nThe lawsuit filed Thursday is among the most recent efforts by Trump officials to push liberal-led states, including Colorado, New York and California, into cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents trying to deporting people living in illegally in the country.\nIllinois and Chicago law prohibits local police from aiding ICE agents conducting immigration enforcement. ICE leaders on Wednesday cited those kinds of laws as they conducted multiple pre-dawn raids across the Denver area, and the new lawsuit echoes their comments.\nThe newly signed Laken Riley Act encourages state officials to sue the federal government if they think it's not effectively enforcing federal immigration laws, and the lawsuit argues the new law is a clear example that Congress wants states to act on immigration.\nIllinois, along with Chicago and other states and cities, have laws that limit the amount of cooperation local law enforcement can give to federal immigration officials, particularly when it comes to detaining people accused of immigration violations. Those \"detainers\" have previously often been ruled illegal.\n\"The challenged provisions of Illinois, Chicago, and Cook County law have the purpose and effect of making it more difficult for, and deliberately impeding, federal immigration officers\u2019 ability to carry out their responsibilities in those jurisdictions,\" the Attorney General's office wrote in its lawsuit. \"The Supremacy Clause prohibits Illinois, Chicago, Cook County, and their officials from obstructing the Federal Government\u2019s ability to enforce laws that Congress has enacted or to take actions entrusted to it by the Constitution.\"\nPresident Donald Trump promised to make immigration enforcement a top priority for his new administration, and in his first few weeks in office, ICE officials have conducted multiple raids around the country, along with opening up Guantanamo Bay as a detention center to hold up to 30,000 people being deported.\nThe lawsuit cites several examples of men who were released from local jail custody instead of being held for ICE pickup, who then went on to commit more crimes. Laken Riley, a Georgia nursing student, was killed in 2024 by a Venezuelan man living illegally in the United States who had previously been arrested for shoplifting but not deported.\nThe Riley act requires ICE to detain people who are in the United States without legal status and who are arrested, charged with or accused of certain crimes including burglary, theft, larceny and shoplifting, or assaulting a law enforcement officer. A person does not have to be convicted, only accused of a crime, to be detained and deported.\nIn a statement, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said the state will defend its choices in court. The governor, a Democrat, has long opposed many Trump policies.\n\"Instead of working with us to support law enforcement, the Trump Administration is making it more difficult to protect the public, just like they did when Trump pardoned the convicted January 6 violent criminals,\" Pritzker said in a statement. \"We look forward to seeing them in court.\""

See Michelle Wu's response\n- President Trump's border czar Tom Homan criticized Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox for the city's immigration policies.\n- Boston Mayor Michelle Wu defended Cox and the city's policies in response.\n- Homan and Wu have clashed before over Boston's status as a sanctuary city.\nBoston Mayor Michelle Wu has responded after President Trump's border czar Tom Homan said over the weekend that he is \"bringing hell\" to the city.\nWhile speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday, Homan criticized Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox over an interview about the city's policies on immigration issues.\n\u201cI read a story last night: the police commissioner of Boston, you said you\u2019d double down on not helping the law enforcement office of ICE,\u201d Homan said. \u201cI\u2019m coming to Boston and I\u2019m bringing hell with me.\u201d\nOn Sunday, Wu defended Cox, calling Homan's comments \"pretty insulting.\"\nWhat did Tom Homan say about 'bringing hell' to Boston?\nHoman didn't specify which interview he was referencing when he said he's \"bringing hell\" to Boston.\nHowever, in an interview with WCVB last week, Cox reiterated Boston's status as a sanctuary city; under the Trust Act, city law enforcement officials are prohibited from cooperating with ICE to carry out civil warrants.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t care about your immigration status. What we do care about is: Are you a victim of crime in our city, or are you a victimizer? We will hold you accountable for that, and that doesn't matter what your immigration status is,\" Cox said.\nHoman criticized Cox's comments as political.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a police commissioner, take that badge off your chest and put it in the desk drawer, because you became a politician. You forgot what it\u2019s like to be a cop,\" he said.\nMichelle Wu says Tom Homan's comments are 'pretty clueless'\nWu defended Cox against the comments during a Vietnamese Lunar New Year celebration Sunday in Boston.\n\"It\u2019s pretty clueless for someone to be insulting our police commissioner,\" Wu told reporters. \"We want to be sure to say Boston is welcoming and safe for everyone.\"\nShe also called Homan's statements \"insulting,\" adding, \"we have the best police commissioner in the country.\"\nOn Saturday, she also wrote in a post on Bluesky Social that Cox \"has my complete confidence & support.\"\n\"This is our city. We\u2019re going to continue following & enforcing the laws to keep all Bostonians safe,\" she wrote.\nWu and Homan have clashed before on immigration\nThis is not the first time Wu and Homan have clashed over immigration issues.\nIn November 2024, Wu told WCVB that city officials planned to \"protect our residents\" against federal deportation plans, which she said \"actually threaten the safety of everyone by causing widespread fear and having large scale economic impact.\"\nIn turn, Homan criticized Wu and Gov. Maura Healey's comments in an interview with Newsmax.\n\"They don't have to help us, but they need to get the hell out of the way, because we're coming, we're going to do it, which means if I gotta send twice as many resources to that sanctuary city, twice as many agents, that's exactly what I'm going to do,\" Homan said.\nMelina Khan is a trending reporter for the USA TODAY Network - New England, which serves more than a dozen affiliated publications across New England.

      "text": "Michelle Wu defends Boston's immigration policies in Congress hearing. Here's what she said\n- Michelle Wu defended Boston's immigration policies during a hearing before the House Oversight Committee.\n- Wu touted the city's safety record and said residents are \"afraid to live their lives\" in the face of Trump's immigration crackdown.\n- She also criticized Tom Homan for comments about \"bringing hell\" to the city.\nBoston Mayor Michelle Wu defended the city's immigration policies during a six-hour hearing before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.\nAlongside three other Democratic mayors \u2014 Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston and New York Mayor Eric Adams \u2014 Wu answered questions from lawmakers about Boston's cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.\nAs President Trump's administration has ramped up immigration enforcement efforts, some officials \u2014 like border czar Tom Homan \u2014 have criticized Wu's justification of the city's so-called sanctuary city policies.\nDuring Wednesday's hearing, Wu touted the city's safety record and pushed back against \"the false narrative\" that all immigrants are criminals.\nWu's opening remarks: Boston is 'the safest major city in the country'\nIn Mayor Wu's opening statement during the hearing Wednesday, she promoted Boston's safety record and defended the city's residents.\n\"We are the safest major city in the country,\" she said. \"Because our gun laws are the strongest in the nation. Because our officers have built relationships over decades. And because all of our residents trust that they can call 911 in the event of an emergency or to report a crime.\"\nShe criticized the Trump administration's federal crackdown on deportation efforts, saying residents have expressed \"fear and frustration.\"\n\"This federal administration is making hard-working, tax-paying, God-fearing people afraid to live their lives,\" she said. \"A city that\u2019s scared is not a city that\u2019s safe. A land ruled by fear is not the land of the free.\"\nWu on Tom Homan: 'Shame on him for lying about my city'\nBoston's mayor also criticized Trump's border czar after he said last month that he planned on \"bringing hell\" to the city.\nIn response to a question from Rep. Gerry Connolly about Homan's comments, Wu called on the committee to question him under oath.\n\"Let's talk about Tom Homan,\" Wu said. \"Shame on him for lying about my city, for having the nerve to insult our police commissioner who has overseen the safest Boston's been in anyone's lifetime. Bring him here under oath and let's ask him some questions.\"\nWu says police cooperate with ICE on criminal warrants\nRegarding the city's immigration policies, Wu emphasized that Boston police officers work with immigration officials only on criminal warrants.\nUnder the Trust Act, local law enforcement officials are prohibited from cooperating with ICE on carrying out civil warrants. The 2014 law makes Boston a so-called sanctuary city, though Wu's administration doesn't use the term.\n\u201cWhenever someone commits a crime, whenever there\u2019s a criminal warrant, we hold them accountable,\u201d Wu said during the hearing. \u201cIf ICE deems that they are dangerous enough to obtain a criminal warrant, we hold them accountable.\u201d\nLater, Wu pushed back against Rep. Paul Gosar after he accused the mayors of protecting criminals with their policies.\n\u201cThe false narrative is that immigrants in general are criminals, or immigrants in general cause all sorts of danger and harm that is actually what is undermining safety in our communities,\u201d Wu said.\nShe added, \u201cIf you want to make us safe, pass gun reforms, stop cutting Medicaid, stop cutting cancer research, stop cutting funds for veterans. That is what will make our city safe.\u201d\nMelina Khan is a trending reporter for the USA TODAY Network - New England, which serves more than a dozen affiliated publications across New England.

  "argos_summary": "The Trump administration is threatening legal action and the withholding of federal funds from over 20 'sanctuary' jurisdictions, including Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Boston, due to their non-cooperation with ICE. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that these sanctuary policies endanger American citizens, while local leaders argue that such cooperation deters crime victims from reporting incidents. Boston's Mayor Michelle Wu defended the city's policies, emphasizing that local law enforcement only collaborates with ICE on criminal warrants, and criticized the narrative that immigrants are inherently criminal.",
