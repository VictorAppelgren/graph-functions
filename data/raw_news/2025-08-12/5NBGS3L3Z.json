  "title": "The Matter 1.4.2 update has the smart home upgrades you didn't know you needed",
  "description": "As the CSA prepares to launch Matter 1.5 this fall, a 1.4.2 update is setting the stage to improve your user experience.",
  "content": "The smart home world is gearing up for the Matter 1.5 update this fall, but the CSA just announced a 1.4.2 update as a precursor to prepare the field. Matter 1.4.2 makes devices more secure and efficient, enhancing the user experience, likely without you realizing that major changes have been made. That's the beauty of Matter: we're watching the connectivity protocol grow and blossom into a fully fledged and future-proof smart home wonder.\n\nThe Matter 1.4.2 update includes Wi-Fi-only commissioning, improved scene management, quieter network reporting, standardized robot vacuum behaviors, and multiple security changes to protect Matter users further.\n\nAlso: 7 common household devices to unplug to save money on your electricity bill\n\nAs Matter continues to grow into a fully fledged smart home connectivity standard, the CSA periodically releases updates to make the protocol secure and easier to use. Everything from adding a new smart home device to its compatibility list to giving users more control options via Matter comes in the form of an update.\n\nSmart home users will be able to enjoy smoother, faster, and more reliable scenes from their Matter devices, likely noticing improved responsiveness and performance. Matter 1.4.2 supports more complex actions and fewer commands to execute a scene, making them run faster and more reliably.\n\nFor robot vacuum users, the new update standardizes how these devices respond to user commands, delivering more predictable performance from robot vacuums. This means that if you tell a Matter-certified robot vacuum to start a new job, it'll know to stop the current one first so that you don't have to manually cancel the job before sending it to its new task.\n\nFor security, Matter 1.4.2 offers Vendor ID (VID) verification, Access Restriction Lists (ARLs), and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) to prevent tampering and unauthorized access. VID verification ensures the admins on a device are from the correct vendor, giving you the peace of mind that you're not using malicious actors impersonating trusted vendors.\n\nAlso: I tested GPT-5's coding skills, and it was so bad that I'm sticking with GPT-4o (for now)\n\nARLs restrict access to sensitive settings on network devices, such as routers, so only verified controllers can change important configurations. This approach provides stronger protection against an untrusted app messing up your network settings. CRLs protect you from unknowingly adding an insecure or fraudulent device to your smart home by letting Matter flag and block those with compromised or outdated certificates.\n\nWhile the Matter 1.4.2 update doesn't add new device compatibility to its growing list of supported products, it delivers on increased efficiency and reliability. For example, the update adds Wi-Fi-only commissioning for new Matter devices to be set up using Wi-Fi only, without Bluetooth. This capability means manufacturers will be able to create cheaper devices without Bluetooth hardware, and that older Wi-Fi-only products will be able to support Matter with just a software update.\n\nThis release also delivers consistent endpoint unique IDs so users don't see duplicate devices when reconfiguring or updating their connections. The CSA announced that Matter 1.4.2 enhances how devices report, which reduces unnecessary updates and makes your home network less congested and more efficient.\n\nAlso: 5 settings I changed on my TV to greatly reduced my electricity bill - and why they work\n\nThe 1.4.2 update is designed to improve security and ensure more reliable Matter products, creating a better experience from the start. While this update may seem small, it ensures that device performance is more reliable and secure, setting the stage for the Matter 1.5 release this fall.\n\nSign up for our News Alerts to never miss an update on the latest tech news.",

Because LED-backlit TVs and OLEDs consume less power than traditional LCD screens, newer models cost about $32 annually.\nAlso: How to clear your TV cache (and why you shouldn't wait to do it)\nIn large part, the bigger your screen size, the more power your TV requires. But there are ways to attenuate your TV's power consumption every time you turn it on. Here are some settings you can change to save more money on your next electricity bill. Even if it's just tens of dollars that you're ultimately saving, it's still a little less money coming out of your pocket, and that's the goal.\nWhat are EnergyGuide ratings?\nFirst, if you're thinking of buying a new TV, start with the most fundamental source of information: the EnergyGuide label and the ENERGY STAR rating. Each TV on a showroom floor will display these labels. This information from manufacturers provides a reliable metric for comparing efficiency among TV sets.\nAlso: Your TV's USB port is criminally underrated: 5 features you're not using enough\nRatings range from A to G, with an A rating being the highest and most energy-efficient. However, it is rare to find a TV with an A rating. For a smart TV, a rating of D or E is considered highly efficient. New TVs certified by ENERGY STAR must have comparable features and be 25% more energy-efficient than competitors. While many energy-efficient televisions may cost more upfront, you'll quickly recover the difference in price through energy savings.\nBut what about your current TV settings? There are a few you can tweak for better results.\n1. Lower your brightness\nBrightness on any television is a tricky variable. It can enhance your viewing experience, but sometimes too much brightness isn't worth the money. Over-brightness can distort clarity and contrast, and it also costs extra pennies. Some newer TVs have sensors that detect ambient light -- automatic brightness control (ABC) -- and automatically adjust the brightness.\nAlso: The best home battery and backup systems: Expert tested\nOn your TV, look for an Eco mode or Movie mode. Select one of these for optimal energy efficiency and a realistic viewing experience. In the end, you might do both your eyes and your checkbook a favor by reducing brightness.\n2. Set a sleep timer\nI know it's not ideal sleep hygiene, but I confess that I enjoy going to bed with my TV on. I luxuriate in drifting off, bathed in its comforting glow. This is also senseless, I know, in terms of being economical. So, I set a sleep timer on my Samsung. When the TV detects no activity for two hours, it automatically turns off. This is similar to Standby mode, which you can also enable to power down your set after a predetermined period of no interaction.\n3. Turn off your screen when streaming music\nEver listen to Spotify or one of the music channels included in your cable package? If you're listening to music through your TV, you don't really need the visuals. Many TVs have a special setting that allows you to turn off the screen entirely, but you can also lower the brightness if that option isn't available.\nAlso: Don't cancel Netflix yet: I used these secret codes to unlock the full catalog of shows\nThe same goes for using your TV simply for background noise. If you're not watching the screen, you can save money by turning off the lumens and focusing on the volume.\n4. Power down completely\nNew TV sets use about 55 kilowatt-hours (kWh) a year. For comparison, a refrigerator uses an average of 550 kWh per year -- but your refrigerator lacks the luxury of shutting down for a rest. Even when you turn off your TV with the remote, it tends to go into Standby mode, continuing to use about 0.4 watts. To really limit your TV's power consumption, I suggest plugging it and any peripherals into a power strip, so you can swiftly switch everything on and off.\n5. A note on picture quality and power\nIf you're looking to significantly reduce energy usage, an OLED TV is an excellent choice due to its advanced pixel technology. OLED TVs feature pixels that emit their own light and can turn on and off individually. This precise control allows for deeper blacks, higher contrast, and lower overall power consumption. By turning off individual pixels when displaying dark scenes, OLED TVs consume less power compared to traditional LCDs, which require a backlight that's always on.\nAlso: I changed 5 settings on my TV to significantly improve the performance\nAs mentioned earlier, if you're in the market for a TV, I recommend an OLED model with an EnergyGuide rating of D that's ENERGY STAR certified. However, it's important to note that higher resolutions mean more pixels, which can result in greater energy consumption. A 4K screen has 8.29 million pixels, four times more than a 1080p screen, requiring four times the energy.\nBefore making a decision, consider your viewing habits. Many streaming services still offer content in 720p or 1080p. Assess how frequently you watch 4K content to determine if the higher energy consumption of a 4K TV is justified for your needs.\nFAQ\nDo newer TVs use less electricity?\nYes, generally. With advancing technology, newer TVs tend to be more energy efficient. LED-backlit TVs use a fraction of the electricity that older LCD screens consume, and OLED technology offers even greater efficiency.\nWhat's the most energy-efficient type of TV?\nOLED (organic light-emitting diode) TVs are currently considered the most energy-efficient option. They offer brighter, thinner, and more efficient screens than other technologies.\nHow much can I save by using energy-saving features?\nTVs with energy-saving features consume significantly less power. ENERGY STAR-certified TVs are, on average, at least 25% more energy efficient than conventional models.\nDoes screen size affect power consumption?\nYes, larger screens typically consume more power. The good news is that the impact of size on energy consumption has decreased with newer technologies.\nShould I replace my old TV with a new, more efficient model?\nIf your current TV is ancient, you can always buy a replacement that could result in energy savings -- although you might consider the environmental impact of disposing of your old TV and manufacturing a new one. If your current TV still has a good picture, I suggest trying some of these energy-saving practices first."

      "text": "Oversharing online? 5 ways it makes you an easy target for cybercriminals\nHave you ever posted something personal or sensitive on social media and regretted it later? Many of us have fallen into that trap. Whether you use Facebook, Instagram, X (aka Twitter), Snapchat, Threads, Bluesky, or even LinkedIn, sometimes you post before you think and eventually realize you overshared. Sure, you can delete your post. But by then, hundreds or thousands of people may have already seen it.\nOversharing on social media can not only be embarrassing but can also hurt you in several ways. You could put your privacy at risk, damage your personal or professional reputation, or present a target to scammers who may use the information you shared to steal your identity.\nAlso: Phone theft is on the rise - 7 ways to protect your device before it's too late\nWith all of that in mind, Christoph C. Cemper, founder of AI prompt generator AIPRM, offered his thoughts on the key risks of oversharing and how to avoid this temptation.\nThe risks of oversharing online\nIdentity theft\nSocial media often provides a treasure trove of information for scammers. Your account pages and posts can reveal not just your name but your date of birth, home address, places where you've worked, and even tidbits on your friends and contacts.\nAlso: Why you should power off your phone once a week - according to the NSA\nCybercriminals who access your personal details can impersonate you with the intent of stealing your identity. By doing so, they could tap into your financial accounts and create new ones in your name. Pretending to be you, they could even convince your friends to share personal information.\n\"The host of readily available personal information on social media has made it even easier for criminals to carry out identity theft, and with the rise of AI's capabilities, this is even quicker to do,\" Cemper said. \"That's why it's crucial to think carefully about what you share online -- not just to protect your own privacy, but also the security of your family and friends, who could be targeted by a fake version of you.\"\nSocial engineering and financial scams\nScammers often use social engineering to lay traps for people on social media. One way they can ensnare you is by impersonating your online friends and contacts, thereby tricking you into sharing sensitive information. Once they've captured your trust, they can steal your money or personal data.\nAlso: 5 warning signs that your phone's been hacked - and how to fight back\n\"It is vital to be wary of who you follow and interact with on social media,\" said Cemper. \"With deepfakes and AI becoming more prevalent and advanced, it is hard to tell if you are talking to a legitimate person or an attacker. Always be cautious when engaging with people on social media, and if they claim to be someone you know, be sure to ask them personal questions that only they would know the answer to.\"\nDeepfakes and voice cloning\nWith the right AI tools and technologies, a scammer can cook up a fake photo or video, or clone a person's voice. The goal is to generate a social media profile that seems legitimate but is designed to con people.\n\"Deepfakes are becoming widespread, and with our voices and images often available on social media, millions are at risk of becoming victims,\" Cemper said. \"To protect yourself, make sure that those you follow on social media and allow to view your content are people you know and trust. Having a publicly open profile increases your risk of being targeted. If you think you have been a victim of a deepfake, contact your local fraud center as soon as possible to report it.\"\nDamage to your reputation\nSaying the wrong things on social media can hurt your personal or professional reputation. This applies not only to sensitive details about your own life and career but to any improper posts, negative comments, or fake news that you share.\n\"Malicious actors can spread misinformation and disinformation, which is notoriously hard to spot online,\" said Cemper. \"Many people have fallen into the trap of engaging with this content, whether it be an AI-generated image or a fake article. Always fact-check any news or sources you see on social media via trusted and reputable sites, as unverified online information could be fake, and may even include fraudulent links.\"\nOversharing information about your children\nIn a practice known as \"sharenting,\" some parents will share details about their own children through social media. This can be dangerous as criminals can use the information to target your kids. Geotagging photos of your children can reveal where they live. Sharing names, ages, and photos can open them up to cyberbullying, harassment, and identity theft.\nAlso: The best password managers: Expert tested\n\"Cybercrime is rising rapidly, and exposing your child's details online could see them fall victim to fraud or other crimes,\" said Cemper. \"If you want to share images or details on your child's activities, it is always best to do this in private group chats with people you trust. I would always advise avoiding sharing this information on social media, due to the risks involved. If you do share information about your child via social media, ensure this is to a small, trustworthy following and is not publicly available. Be sure to limit the information that you share about them and their whereabouts.\"\nHow to avoid oversharing online\n1. Review your privacy settings\nPeriodically review the privacy settings on Facebook and other social media you use. Control the reach of your posts and personal information to make sure only trusted friends can see them.\n2. Think before you share\nBe careful before you post any personal information, especially details that may provide answers to your account security questions or reveal your specific location or the locations of family and friends. Limiting what you share helps protect you from identity theft and other threats.\n3. Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication\nTo safeguard your own social media accounts, make sure you use strong and secure passwords backed up by multi-factor authentication. Never share your passwords or other sensitive account details, and avoid passwords with personal information like names or birthdays.\nAlso: 7 password rules security experts live by in 2025\n4. Be careful when clicking on links\nDon't click on any suspicious links you see on social media, as these can be traps set by scammers looking to steal your money or personal information. One way you can learn more about where a link really goes is to hover over it with your cursor. Your browser should show you a URL preview. Carefully examine the URL for clues about its legitimacy. When in doubt, don't click. Also, limit the people who can contact you on social media, and be cautious about any messages you receive.\n5. Review your account for suspicious activity\nRegularly check out your social media accounts for suspicious activity. If a friend's invitation, message, or post seems shady, report it to the company and avoid interacting with it. Call or text your friend through another messaging service to verify directly with them.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "I tested GPT-5's coding skills, and it was so bad that I'm sticking with GPT-4o (for now)\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- OpenAI's new GPT-5 flagship failed half of my programming tests.\n- Previous OpenAI releases have had just about perfect results.\n- Now that OpenAI has enabled fallbacks to other LLMs, there are options.\nSo GPT-5 happened. It's out. It's released. It's the talk of the virtual town. And it's got some problems. I'm not gonna bury the lede. GPT-5 has failed half of my programming tests. That's the worst that OpenAI's flagship LLM has ever done on my carefully designed tests.\nAlso: The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use)\nBefore I get into the details, let's take a moment to discuss one other little feature that's also a bit wonky. Check out the new Edit button on the top of the code dumps it generates.\nClicking the Edit button takes you into a nice little code editor. Here, I replaced the Author field, right in ChatGPT's results.\nThat seemed nice, but it ultimately proved futile. When I closed the editor, it asked me if I wanted to save. I did. Then this unhelpful message showed up.\nI never did get back to my original session. I had to submit my original prompt again, and let GPT-5 do its work a second time.\nBut wait. There's more. Let's dig into my test results\u2026\n1. Writing a WordPress plugin\nThis was my very first test of coding prowess for any AI. It's what gave me that first \"the world is about to change\" feeling, and it was done using GPT-3.5.\nSubsequent tests, using the same prompt but with different AI models, generated mixed results. Some AIs did great, some didn't. Some AIs, like those from Microsoft and Google, improved over time.\nAlso: How I test an AI chatbot's coding ability - and you can, too\nChatGPT's model has been the gold standard for this test since the very beginning. That makes the results of GPT-5 all that much more curious.\nSo, look, the actual coding with GPT-5 was partially successful. GPT-5 generated a single block of code, which I pasted into a file and was able to run. It provided the requisite UI.\nWhen I pasted in the test names, it dynamically updated the line count, although it described it as \"Line to randomize\" instead of \"Lines to randomize.\"\nBut then, when I clicked Randomize, it didn't. Instead, it redirected me to tools.php. What?? ChatGPT has never had a problem with this test, whether GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or GPT-4o. You mean to tell me that OpenAI's much-anticipated GPT-5 is failing right out of the gate? Ouch.\nAlso: How to use GPT-5 in VS Code with GitHub Copilot\nI then gave GPT-5 this prompt.\nWhen I click randomize, I'm taken to http://testsite.local/wp-admin/tools.php. I do not get a list of randomized results. Can you fix?\nThe result was a line to patch. I'm not thrilled with that approach because it requires the user to dig through code and to make no mistakes replacing a line.\nSo, I asked GPT-5 for a full plugin. It gave me the full text of the plugin to copy and paste. This time, it worked.\nThis time, it did randomize the lines. When it encountered duplicates, it separated them from each other, as it was instructed. Finally.\nAlso: I found 5 AI content detectors that can correctly identify AI text 100% of the time\nI'm sorry, OpenAI. I have to fail you on this test. You would have passed if the only error was not using the plural of \"line\" when appropriate. But the fact that it gave me back a non-working plugin on the first try is fail territory, even if the AI did eventually make it work on the second try.\nNo matter how you spin it, this is a step back.\n2. Rewriting a string function\nThis second test is designed to rewrite a string function to better check for dollars and cents. The original code that GPT-5 was asked to rewrite did not allow for cents (it only checked for integers).\nGPT-5 did fine with this test. It did return a minimal result because it didn't do any error checking. It didn't check for non-string input, extra whitespace, thousands separators, or currency symbols.\nBut that's not what I asked for. I told it to rewrite a function, which itself did not have any error checking. GPT-5 did exactly what I asked with no embellishment. I'm kind of glad of that because it doesn't know whether or not code prior to this routine already did that work.\nGPT-5 passed this test.\n3. Finding an annoying bug\nThis test came about because I was struggling with a less-than-obvious bug in my code. Without going into the weeds about how the WordPress framework works, the obvious answer is not the right answer.\nYou need some fairly arcane knowledge about how WordPress filters pass their information. This test has been a stumbling block for more than a few AI LLMs.\nAlso: Gen AI disillusionment looms, according to Gartner's 2025 Hype Cycle report\nGPT-5, however, like GPT-4 and GPT-4o before it, did understand the problem. It articulated a clear solution.\nGPT-5 passed this test.\n4. Writing a script\nThis test asks the AI to incorporate a fairly obscure Mac scripting tool called Keyboard Maestro, as well as Apple's scripting language AppleScript, and Chrome scripting behavior.\nIt's really a test of the reach of the AI in terms of knowledge, its understanding of how web pages are constructed, and the ability to write code across three interlinked environments.\nQuite a few AIs have failed this test, but the failure point is usually a lack of knowledge about Keyboard Maestro. GPT-3.5 didn't know about Keyboard Maestro. But ChatGPT has been passing this test since GPT-4. Until now.\nWhere should we start? Well, the good news is that GPT-5 handled the Keyboard Maestro part of the problem just fine. But it got the coding so wrong that it even doubled down on its lack of understanding of how case works in AppleScript.\nIt actually invented a property. This is one of those cases where an AI confidently presents an answer that is completely wrong.\nAlso: ChatGPT comes with personality presets now - and other upgrades you might have missed\nAppleScript is natively case-insensitive. If you want AppleScript to pay attention to case, you need to use a \"considering case\" block. So, this happened.\nThe reason the error message referred to the title of one of my articles is because that was the front window in Chrome. This function checks the front window and does stuff based on the title.\nBut misunderstanding how case works wasn't the only AppleScript error GPT-5 generated. It also referenced a variable named searchTerm without defining it. That's pretty much an error-creating practice in any programming language.\nFail, fail, fail, McFaildypants.\nThe internet hath spoken\nOpenAI seemed to suffer from the same hubris that its AIs do. It confidently moved everyone to GPT-5 and burned the bridges back to GPT-4o. I'm paying $200 a month for a ChatGPT Pro account. On Friday, I couldn't move back to GPT-4o for coding work. Neither could anyone else.\nThere was, however, just a tiny bit of user pushback on the whole bridges burning thing. And by tiny, I mean the entire frickin' internet. So, by Saturday, ChatGPT had a new option.\nTo get to this, go to your ChatGPT settings and turn on \"Show legacy models.\" Then, as it has always been, just drop down the model menu and choose the one you want. Note: this option is only available to those on paid tiers. If you're using ChatGPT for free, you'll take what you're given, and you'll love it.\nEver since the whole generative AI thing kicked off at the beginning of 2023, ChatGPT has been the gold standard of programming tools, at least according to my LLM testing.\nAlso: Microsoft rolls out GPT-5 across its Copilot suite - here's where you'll find it\nNow? I'm really not sure. This is only a day or so after GPT-5 has been released, so its results will probably get better over time. But for now, I'm sticking with GPT-4o for coding, although I do like the deep reasoning capabilities in GPT-5.\nWhat about you? Have you tried GPT-5 for programming tasks yet? Did it perform better or worse than previous versions like GPT-4o or GPT-3.5? Were you able to get working code on the first try, or GPT-4o did you have to guide it through fixes? Are you going to use GPT-5 for coding or stick with older models? Let us know in the comments below.\nYou can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

Microsoft has stated, forcefully, that it will not revise those requirements. You will also hit roadblocks if your PC doesn't have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0, or if the TPM is not enabled.\nAlso: Two ways to get free Windows 10 security updates through October 2026\nThat might be the official policy, but -- as with everything Windows-related -- it pays to read the fine print.\nThose pesky restrictions prevent you from automatically upgrading to Windows 11 using Windows Update or the Windows 11 Installation Assistant. Yet, as I detail in ZDNET's Windows 11 FAQ, there are documented workarounds for most PCs that were originally built for Windows 10.\nOver the past few years, Microsoft has played a cat-and-mouse game with enthusiasts, adding occasional speed bumps that make it more difficult to bypass these compatibility checks. There are workarounds for most modern PCs, but some older devices, especially those built using AMD processors, might be out of luck. The instructions below take all those developments into account.\nAlso: Can your old PC handle the Windows 11 upgrade? How to find out - before you try\nThese instructions also assume that you have a PC running a retail or OEM edition of Windows 10 (Home or Pro) and that you are signed in as an administrator on the PC you want to upgrade.\nWhich option should you choose?\nPlease don't skip over this section.\nThis article describes two upgrade options. To take advantage of the workaround described in option 1 below, your computer must meet all the other requirements for Windows 11.\n- It must be configured to start up using UEFI, not a legacy BIOS configuration.\n- Secure Boot must be supported, although it does not need to be enabled. (But seriously, folks, you should enable Secure Boot.)\n- A TPM must be enabled; version 1.2 is OK, but a system without any TPM or with the TPM disabled will fail. Any PC that was originally designed for Windows 10 should include a TPM 2.0.\nTo check these details on a PC you're considering upgrading, run the System Information utility, Msinfo32.exe, and look at the System Summary page. Pay special attention to the BIOS Mode value. If it says \"Legacy,\" you'll need to reconfigure your system to UEFI mode (and convert your system disk from MBR to GPT partitioning) before you can install Windows 11 as a normal upgrade.\nAlso: Why Windows 11 requires a TPM - and how to get around it\nTo see whether your PC has a TPM enabled, run the Trusted Platform Module Management tool, Tpm.msc. If your computer includes a TPM and it's turned on, this app will display information about it. Under the TPM Manufacturer Information heading, check the specification version to confirm that it is 2.0. If there's no TPM, or if the TPM is disabled in firmware settings, you'll see a message that says \"Compatible TPM cannot be found.\"\nIf you're unable (or unwilling) to change from Legacy BIOS to UEFI, or if you have an older PC that doesn't have a TPM option at all, you'll need to use the second option, which takes advantage of an undocumented hack that allows you to bypass the compatibility checks and complete the upgrade. Skip to the Option 2 section of this post for details on how to use the free Rufus utility to perform this upgrade.\nAlso: How to install Windows 11 your way (and avoid Microsoft's restrictions)\nFinally, note that Microsoft added a new set of restrictions as part of the Windows 11 version 24H2 update. These changes require a CPU that supports specific instructions -- SSE4.2 and PopCnt. Most PCs with Intel CPUs from 2009 or later will meet this standard. AMD CPUs from 2013 or later should also meet these requirements. But it is impossible to upgrade to Windows 11 version 24H2 on a PC that was built in 2008 or earlier. For details, see \"Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This trusty tool can (probably) fix that.\"\nIf you plan to perform a clean installation of Windows 11, you can boot from installation media and run Windows Setup. That option skips the CPU compatibility check completely (but still requires a TPM and Secure Boot support). After the installation completes, you'll need to reinstall all your apps, restore your data files, and tweak settings to personalize your system preferences.\nWant to avoid all that hassle? Choose the option that's appropriate for your hardware.\nOption 1: Use this simple registry edit\nWith this registry edit, you can bypass CPU checks and accept any TPM version. Please be aware that this option requires that you run the Setup program from within your current Windows installation. You can't boot from a USB flash drive and install Windows 11 this way.\nThis process requires four steps.\n1. Change one key in the Windows registry\nYou need to make one small change to the Windows registry. For more than three years, this change was documented at Microsoft's support website, but the company removed those instructions in December 2024. (Here's an archived version of that support article.) This change tells the Windows 11 Setup program to skip the check for compatible CPUs and to allow installation on a PC with an older TPM (version 1.2). The usual warnings apply when working with the registry; I recommend you make a complete backup before proceeding.\nOpen Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) and navigate to the following key:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\MoSetup\nIf the MoSetup key doesn't exist, you need to create it. Right-click the node for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup in the left-hand navigation pane, then choose New > Key. Name it MoSetup and press Enter.\nAlso: Wiping your Windows laptop? Here's the simplest way to erase all personal data\nSelect the MoSetup key and then right-click in any empty space in the pane on the right. Choose the option to create a new DWORD value. (Don't choose the QWORD option!)\nReplace the default name for that key by typing the text AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU and then press Enter. Then double-click the new value and change the \"Value data\" box to 1. The result should look like this:\nCheck for typos before proceeding -- Windows is frustratingly literal about the contents of the registry, and if you misspell the key or value name, your upgrade will fail. Click OK to save your change, and then restart your PC.\n2. Download the Windows 11 ISO\nOn the PC you want to upgrade, go to the Windows 11 Download page (aka.ms/DownloadWindows11) and choose the option at the bottom of the page, \"Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for x64 devices.\" Save the ISO file in your Downloads folder.\nNote that this is a big file. Depending on the speed of your internet connection, the download could take a while.\nAlso: The ultimate Windows 11 upgrade guide: Everything you need to know\nFor those running Windows with English (UK) as the selected language, choose English (United States) when prompted for a product language. Several readers have reported that choosing English International results in an upgrade that does not allow you to keep installed apps and data files.\n3. Mount the ISO file in File Explorer\nAfter the download completes, open File Explorer and double-click the ISO file you downloaded in the previous step. Doing so mounts the file as a virtual DVD drive in its own folder, with its own drive letter.\n4. Run Windows Setup\nIn File Explorer, find the Setup.exe file in the virtual drive you opened in the previous step and double-click it to begin the upgrade. You'll see a stern warning about compatibility issues and the possibility that performing an upgrade will mean you are not entitled to future updates. You can safely click Accept to move past this message. (For details on what that warning message really means, see \"Is Microsoft really going to cut off security updates for your 'unsupported' Windows 11 PC?\" Spoiler: They are not going to cut off security updates.) After you click OK on that dialog box, your upgrade should proceed without any serious issues.\nIf you're upgrading from the same edition (Home or Pro), you'll have three options: You can keep your apps, settings, and files (Full Upgrade); keep your data files but start fresh with apps and settings (Keep Data Only); or start completely fresh (Clean Install).\nOption 2: Use the free Rufus utility\nOn older PCs without a TPM and on PCs that don't support Secure Boot, you'll need to use an undocumented hack to bypass the compatibility checker. You can do this manually by replacing the Appraiserres.dll file (in the Sources subfolder on the Windows 11 installer drive) with a zero-byte version and then making a series of registry edits. But it's simpler to use the free, open-source Rufus utility to create installation media (on a USB flash) drive that includes these tweaks automatically.\nTo get started, download Rufus version 4.6 or later. Earlier versions won't work, thanks to changes Microsoft made in October 2024 to its compatibility checking tools. For details of how the newer versions work, see \"Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This just-released tool can get the job done.\" In addition, be aware that using Rufus will not allow you to bypass the new restrictions on very old PCs that were introduced with Windows 11 version 24H2.\nIf you have a PC with a CPU that lacks support for SSE4.2 and PopCnt instructions, not even Rufus can help. (Of course, any PC that fails that test is nearly 20 years old and probably deserves to be retired.)\nAlso: Yes, you can upgrade that old PC to Windows 11, even if Microsoft says no. These readers proved it\nTo get started, you'll need to download the Windows 11 ISO. Be sure to save it to the Downloads folder of your Windows system drive so you can find it easily. You'll also need a USB flash drive of at least 16 GB in size. You will reformat this drive as part of the process, so back up any data on that drive first -- and do not store the Windows 11 ISO here!\n- Download Rufus from the developer's site or from the Microsoft Store and run the app.\n- Choose the USB drive and then choose the \"Disk or ISO image\" option.\n- Click the Select button, choose the Windows 11 ISO you downloaded earlier, and then click Start.\n- In the Windows User Experience dialog, select the first checkbox to remove hardware requirements, as shown in the screenshot below.\n- Click OK to begin creating the drive.\nAfter Rufus successfully creates your installer, open that USB drive in File Explorer, and double-click Setup. Do not try to upgrade by booting from that USB drive and performing a clean install; it won't work.\nAs is the case with the other option, you'll see a warning about compatibility issues. It's a scare tactic. (For details on what the language in that warning message actually means, see \"Is Microsoft really going to cut off security updates for your 'unsupported' Windows 11 PC?\") After you click Accept on that dialog box, your upgrade should proceed without any serious issues.\nAlso: Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This trusty tool can (probably) fix that\nMy ZDNET colleague Lance Whitney has more details on the other options available with Rufus in \"How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and bypass Microsoft's restrictions).\"\nDid your upgrade work?\nIf you've tried this upgrade, I want to hear about your experience.

How the connectivity standard can change your smart home\nWhat is Matter?\nMatter is a relatively new open-source IP-based connectivity standard for smart home technology. The Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA), comprised of Apple, Google, Amazon, and other tech companies, first announced Matter as a joint project called CHIP (Connected Home over Internet Protocol). Matter runs on Wi-Fi and Thread network layers and uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for commissioning.\nConsider that your devices can communicate with each other via Bluetooth -- Matter is another way for devices to connect and communicate. Unlike other connectivity protocols, Matter can be brought to older devices with over-the-air (OTA) updates, giving it far more reach. Amazon, for example, took advantage of this capability a few years ago by updating existing Echo devices to support Matter, and other tech companies followed suit.\nAlso: The best Alexa devices: Expert tested and recommended\nWith extensive support across technologies and manufacturers, Matter can let you natively add a SwitchBot device to your Apple HomeKit ecosystem, for example, which wasn't possible before the protocol launched.\nInstead of devices listing all their supported home assistants, many now come with a Matter logo.\nWhen was Matter launched?\nThe CSA launched Matter 1.0 on Oct. 4, 2022.\nThe CSA released Matter 1.1 in April 2023, with incremental improvements, and Matter 1.2, with support for nine new device types, including home appliances, in October 2023.\nThe CSA released Matter 1.3 in May 2024, adding support for additional major appliances, energy and water management solutions, EV chargers, scenes, and command-batching.\nThe latest version, Matter 1.4, was launched in November 2024, introducing enhancements for multi-admin and network infrastructure with routers and access points.\nWhy was Matter created?\nMatter has received plenty of attention in the Internet of Things (IoT) arena since its announcement in late 2019. The CSA, which created Matter and Zigbee, wants to make Matter the connectivity standard for smart homes.\nSince smart home devices and hubs started appearing on the market, the lack of compatibility between brands and devices has been a big problem. For years, you had to choose your home automation systems carefully, otherwise you might end up with incompatible devices and have to juggle multiple apps to control your home.\nAlso: Better than Ring? This video doorbell has similar features and none of the monthly fees\nThe CSA aims to change this situation by having Matter diminish interoperability woes in home automation systems.\nTech companies have gotten involved quickly. Apple's Corey Wang, a producer in Human Interface Design, mentioned Matter during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC 2022), pointing out the need to have more compatibility across brands in smart home devices for a truly connected home. In 2021, Amazon announced that almost all Echo devices would support Matter and later made OTA updates to existing devices. In 2022, Google added Matter-over-Thread support for its smart home hubs with Thread built-in.\nAlso: Not into the Tesla Powerwall? You can now buy the Anker Solix X1\nMany other tech companies have since launched smart home devices with Matter support, including Eve, Switchbot, Aqara, Govee, and Roborock.\nWhat devices work with Matter?\nMatter support is available for the basic function of many smart home and IoT devices. The following device types can support Matter, as of version 1.4, released in November 2024:\n- Air conditioners (HVAC and room air conditioners)\n- Air purifiers\n- Air quality sensors (supported sensors can capture and report on PM1, PM2.5, PM10, CO2, NO2, VOC, CO, Ozone, Radon, and Formaldehyde)\n- Batteries, including battery walls\n- Bridges and hubs\n- Blinds\n- Cooktops\n- Dishwashers\n- Energy management (energy consumption monitors and devices with energy-reporting capabilities)\n- Electric vehicle (EV) chargers\n- Extractor hoods (cooker hoods and vent hoods)\n- Fans\n- Heat pumps\n- Laundry dryers\n- Light bulbs\n- Light switches\n- Locks\n- Microwave ovens\n- Outlets\n- Ovens\n- Plugs\n- Refrigerators\n- Robot vacuums\n- Security sensors\n- Shades\n- Smoke and carbon monoxide alarms\n- Solar power devices, including inverters\n- Speakers\n- Televisions\n- Thermostats\n- Washing machines\n- Water heaters\n- Water management devices (leak and freeze detectors, smart valves, and rain sensors)\nWhat is a Matter controller?\nA Matter controller is any device or application that controls Matter-certified devices within a network. The controller can be a smart home app, like Apple Home, or a device, like an Amazon Echo Hub.\nAlso: I tried a window-cleaning robot and things went surprisingly well\nMatter controllers let users command devices to perform tasks, like asking your Alexa device to turn smart lights off or on, or using your Google Home to adjust the thermostat.\nHow does Matter benefit me?\nMatter simplifies the smart home business for both manufacturers and consumers. The standard means you don't have to worry about which brands work together or which devices support a specific assistant when you choose a video doorbell or a security camera.\nMatter also allows you to adopt a smart home automation system, like Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, or Google Home, without having to juggle extra apps on your smartphone to control the devices that are incompatible with the system.\nAlso: I tested Roborock's most expensive robot vacuum and found 4 reasons to buy it\nAside from universal compatibility, Matter features strong security protocols to protect smart homes from unauthorized access. The standard also makes for a simplified setup of new devices that will get easier over time, with devices being recognized and controlled by existing systems once they join a network.\nMatter also makes for a reliable connection in your smart home, reducing the likelihood of devices disconnecting or not responding."

We know the feeling of spending hours trying to clean the pet hair, dust, and mini fingerprints scattered around the home, yet feeling like it's impossible to keep up with everything.\nEnter robot vacuums. With varying suction levels for carpet and hard floors, like the most powerful robot vacuum, the Yeedi M12+ Pro, expert obstacle avoidance like the iRobot Roomba j7+, or cleaning and mopping combination, like the fantastic Dreame X40 Ultra, robot vacuums aren't a one-size-fits-all device. The best robot vacuum depends on many factors and your individual use case, including budget, battery life, app features, and cleaning efficiency.\nBest robot vacuum deals of the week\n- $200 (save $150)\n- $299 (save $151)\n- $160 (save $120)\n- $800 (save $100)\nWhat is the best robot vacuum right now?\nOur pick for the best robot vacuum overall is the iRobot Roomba j7+, thanks to its self-emptying capabilities, ability to move across carpet, tile, and hardwood floors, and its easy-to-use app. It's also often discounted, simply because it's not the newest Roomba model, so you can expect its price to fall considerably around sales events. It's the robot we go back to repeatedly after testing others. Read on for the rest of our picks for the best robot vacuums.\nAlso: The best robot vacuum deals: Save on Roomba, Roborock, Eufy, and more\nThe best robot vacuums of 2025\nThe Roomba j7+ is one of our favorite robot vacuums for cleaning carpets, tiles, and rugs throughout a house. After a few initial runs, the j7+ can map a home's layout. Next, you can use the iRobot app to choose your cleaning method. You can select which rooms you want cleaned, in what order, and how many times you want each room cleaned.\nOut of all of our lab-tested robot vacuums, the iRobot Roomba j7+ has some of the highest scores in suction, specifically leading the list with 99.6% of black rice removed from low-pile carpet.\nThere aren't many robot vacuums that we trust to remove ingrained pet hair from our carpets, but the j7+ is an exception to that rule. It gets a complete run of my house and does a great job on different floor surfaces. What sets Roomba vacuums apart from others is intelligence. The j7+ uses\nReview: Roomba j7+\nIf you're a new pet owner, iRobot's P.O.O.P. (Pet Owner Official Promise) guarantee will make you feel comfortable enough to leave your Roomba j7+ and pet in the same area. We love knowing that, no matter what the house looks like, we can send the j7+ out to clean, and it won't suck up something that it shouldn't. The peace of mind is worth every single penny. Amazon customers also rave about this feature, one saying, \"The object identification system is a wonderful addition for pet owners or anyone with loose wires. Having gone through three [poop apocalypses] with our dog and old Roomba over the past five years, the poop avoidance system is a welcome assurance!\"\nThe Roomba j7+ doesn't have mopping capabilities, but it does pair beautifully with the Braava Jet m6. The two iRobot products use the same technology to tag team your vacuuming and mopping needs. I tested both of these robots out, so be sure to check out our full reviews.\nRoomba j7+ features: PrecisionVision Navigation | P.O.O.P. guarantee | Easy robot integration | Price: $498\nThe Dreame X40 Ultra is an outstanding robot vacuum and mop with excellent mapping capabilities and the strongest suction power on the market. The problem? It's very expensive, at $1,900 (though on sale now for $1,000).\nThis robot vacuum and mop has it all, from intelligent navigation to magnetic detachable mop pads that the robot can leave behind at the station to vacuum and then return to put them on and mop. As moms and pet owners, we believe this is the best robot vacuum and mop combination money can buy for busy families with large cleaning areas.\nReview: Dreame X40 Ultra\nThe Dreame X40 Ultra vacuums thoroughly, mops superbly, has a hands-free self-cleaning station, and is great at avoiding obstacles. You don't have to worry about picking up everything from your floors before running it, so you can have it clean your home daily while you're out.\nThough the app could be more user-friendly, the numerous customization options may overshadow that shortcoming. The Dreame X40 Ultra lets you customize cleaning areas and even choose to have the robot vacuum rugs first, do a thorough rug cleaning, and even whether you want it to take pictures of your pet when it spots them.\nAmazon reviewers also feel overwhelmingly positive about the X40 Ultra, one saying, \"The performance of this vacuum is where it truly shines. The suction power is incredible, tackling dust, dirt, and pet hair with ease. It even picks up crumbs and debris that my previous vacuum would have left behind. The Dream X40 Ultra glides effortlessly around furniture and obstacles, never getting stuck or confused, which was a constant issue with my old iRobot J9.\"\nDreame X40 Ultra features: MopExtend cleaning capability | 12,000Pa suction power | Multi-functional base station | Price: $1,000 (limited-time deal)\nThe Narwal Freo X Ulta is a great robot vacuum for sweeping and mopping hard floors. At the discounted price of $1,100, this robot vacuum and mop excels on hard floors, handling debris, crumbs, and hair without tangling. It features a self-emptying dustbin and hands-free mop washing and drying, so all you have to worry about is running it.\nThe Freo X Ultra's reliable performance makes it stand out among others because it can expertly avoid obstacles in its path to prevent getting stuck. In our testing done in a controlled lab environment, we found it removed up to 72.58% of particles and debris (sand and black rice) from hard floors. In addition, its LiDAR 4.0 technology is intelligent enough to adjust its mopping strategy if high dirt is detected.\nReview: Narwal Freo X Ultra\nWe've found this to be one of the best robot vacuums we've tested, and many buyers agree. One verified customer noted, \"One of the most notable aspects is how much quieter the Narwal Freo X Ultra is compared to traditional vacuum cleaners like my Dyson. While the Dyson sounds like a jet engine, the Freo X Ultra goes about its business quietly, even during intense cleaning sessions. This makes it ideal for running in the night time. I highly recommend the Narwal Freo X Ultra to anyone looking for a top-of-the-line robot vacuum and mop.\"\nNarwal Freo X Ultra features: Up to seven weeks without emptying | 8,200Pa suction power | Effective tangle-free technology | Price: $1,100 (limited-time deal)\nThe Yeedi M12 Pro+ truly has no business being this cheap. A 2-in-1 robot vacuum and mop with a self-emptying and self-washing system, the M12 Pro+ has 11,000Pa of suction power, a leader on the market. It features a specialized roller system to prevent hair tangles when vacuuming.\nThis new M12 Pro+ has minor issues, such as struggling to avoid obstacles and getting its brush stuck, though it performs better than other more expensive options. It also lifts its mop pads when going over carpet or rugs, and this feature performed pretty well with my short-pile rugs, but the 9-millimeter lift isn't enough to keep my medium-pile rugs dry.\nReview: Yeedi M12 Pro+\nDespite these minor issues, the M12 Pro+'s robust cleaning features and compact all-in-one charging station make for a high-quality cleaning solution.\n\"The Yeedi M12 Pro+ has not only met but surpassed my expectations,\" one reviewer said about the robot vacuum and mop. \"It's a robust, efficient cleaning tool that has taken the chore out of vacuuming. If you're in the market for a robot vacuum that offers great performance and ease of use, look no further than the Yeedi M12 Pro+.\"\nYeedi M12 Pro+ features: TruEdge deep mopping | 11,000Pa suction power | Zero Tangle technology | Price: $550 (limited-time deal)\nIf you're like us and have a lot of dog hair lying around, we promise you won't be disappointed if you invest in the Roomba s9+. This is Roomba's most powerful robot vacuum to date. It comes in a D-shaped design, allowing the robot to fit in the corners of your home. Once the s9+ gets going, the dual multi-surface brushes suck up everything in their paths. Even on our carpet, the ingrained dog hair and dirt get sucked away and into the robot. One Amazon customer says, \"The Roomba not only works really well from a vacuuming perspective, but it has done a remarkable job learning the house.\"\nAs an iRobot vacuum, the AI inside the s9+ can recognize shoes, socks, cords, and more, so you don't have to worry. And Roomba does a great job keeping your devices up to date, so they're always learning and getting smarter through continued software updates.\nAlso: How Roomba's $1,000 robot vacuum handled my house of children and pets\nThe s9+ comes with an auto-empty base that doubles as a charging station, so once the robot picks up all of your dirt and debris, it's sucked right into an enclosed bag so it stays trapped away. The s9+'s auto-empty base is much smaller than the j7+'s, making it easier to tuck away and blend in with your home decor.\nBecause this is an iRobot device, the Roomba s9+ will pair with the Braava Jet m6 to clean your floors thoroughly.\nRoomba s9+ features: 30% wider dual multi-surface rubber brushes | Delivers 40x power-lifting suction | Dirt Detect technology | Price: $813\nIf you're overwhelmed by the technology and features that come with several of the new robot vacuums, this Shark ION would be an excellent option for you. You don't need an app to get this robot vacuum going: Press the Clean button, and it's off. The tech inside is minimal -- this Shark doesn't map where it's been or have the AI capabilities to avoid cables or shoes, but it makes up for it with its suction power.\nReview: Shark ION AV751\nYou'll want to remember that by not having mapping capabilities, it just drives around, and may clean the same room repeatedly. From our experience, though, running the AV751 daily kept an entire house clean. One day, it may clean the kitchen and living room; the next, it may clean the laundry room and bathroom. The important thing was that the Shark could keep up with two dogs and cat, which is a massive task.\nThe Shark ION Av751 has no auto-empty base, so you must manually dump the dirt and debris into the trash can. But that means the charging station is significantly smaller than many other robot vacs on the market. Shark is a brand name most known and trusted in the cleaning industry, so you can rest assured that this budget-friendly option will be a safe one. Amazon reviewers love the price, one saying, \"In my opinion, this is the BEST budget vacuum at the price point.\"\nShark ION AV751 features: Tri-brush system | Stair/cliff edge detection | Alexa and Google Assistant integrated | Price: $225\nWhat is the best robot vacuum?\nThe Roomba j7+ is one of the smartest, most advanced robot vacuums we have tested on the market. Its PrecisionVision navigation ensures that it's cleaning the rooms you want to be cleaned and gathers an accurate map of your house. The ability to add Cleaning zones for particularly dirty areas or Keep-out zones where you may not want the robot to go is an added bonus.\nPet parents everywhere can agree that the P.O.O.P. guarantee will help them sleep easier at night, knowing their home will get vacuumed without smearing through any accidents. And, of course, being a Roomba device, you know that the robots are always getting new software updates, so your robot vacuum is always getting smarter.\n| Robot vacuum | Price | Obstacle avoidance | Mapping technology | Auto-empty base | Two-in-one vacuum and mop |\n| Roomba j7+ | $449 | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |\n| Dreame X40 Ultra | $1,000 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Narwal Freo X Ultra | $1,100 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Yeedi M12 Pro+ | $550 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Roomba s9+ | $899 | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |\n| Shark ION AV751 | $225 | No | No | No | No |\nWhat is the right robot vacuum for you?\nAfter spending the last two years testing numerous robot vacuums, the one feature that distinguishes them the most is their intelligence. Some individuals are looking for a hands-off approach. They want to set a schedule in the app and not have to worry or think about the robot for weeks at a time. Others may not be that comfortable with tech or want to have more control of where and when the robot is running. Both are reasonable expectations, but you'll be buying two different vacuums.\n| Choose this robot vacuum\u2026 | If you need\u2026 |\n| Roomba j7+ | A highly intelligent, AI-driven vacuum. With its ability to recognize up to 80 household objects, your home will get cleaned while your cords and shoes aren't bothered. |\n| Dreame X40 Ultra | One robot to vacuum every surface type in your home while mopping hardwood/tile/laminate flooring. It's truly an all-in-one machine that will keep your home clean with the touch of a button in the app. |\n| Narwal Freo X Ultra | An affordable robot vacuum that performs like a high-end unit on hard floors, with up to 7 weeks between emptying. |\n| Yeedi M12 Pro+ | You want the top-of-the-line in terms of self-cleaning technology, efficiency, and pure power. |\n| Roomba s9+ | A vacuum to tackle excessive pet hair, dirt, and debris. It's Roomba's best suctioning robot on the market. |\n| Shark ION AV751 | A simple robot vacuum without all of the bells and whistles. This can be a more manageable option for individuals who don't need a lot of technology in their robot vacuum. |\nFactors to consider when choosing a robot vacuum\nWhile trying to determine the best robot vacuum, we kept several factors at the forefront of our testing and research, which can also aid your search.\n- Floor types: Some robot vacuums are equipped to work with certain floor types, like carpet or hardwood. Others may be able to accommodate other floor types, like stone or marble. Before you buy, consider the types of flooring in your home and which vacuum is most appropriate.\n- Mapping: For full automation, your robot vacuum must have a mapping feature to navigate each room. You also want to consider an obstacle avoidance feature that can avoid things like furniture, wires, and even pet waste. This feature is a must-have in my home with strewn about.\n- Battery: A robot vacuum is hardly worth it if it doesn't have the battery to keep it going. Consider the battery time before choosing the best robot vacuum to ensure it has enough power to clean your home. If you select a robot vacuum with the technical capability to pause its job, return to the charging base to refill its battery, and then resume the job where it left off, this may not be as big of a factor as others on this list.\nConnectivity: Many of the best robot vacuums offer voice control, some even with Alexa. Others may feature an app that allows you to control your robot from afar, set schedules, track progress, and control the machine's efforts. If you're hoping for voice activation rather than using an app, check and see if the machine is compatible with the home assistant of your choice.\nHow we test robot vacuums\nZDNET has several robot vacuum reviewers that have tested over 50 units thus far. We conduct tests in real homes with real challenges and in a controlled lab environment for comparison.\nHere's what we consider when testing robot vacuums at ZDNET:\n- Determine evaluation criteria: For our key evaluation criteria, we consider how robots perform by assessing their suction power, navigation, mapping, and battery life. We also assess the user experience, the robot's versatility, longevity, and whether it delivers on its specifications.\n- Unboxing: During this process, we assess the packaging and setup experience and note any accessories and unique features.\n- Testing environments: We test the robot vacuums on different floor types and see how they navigate various obstacles to test performance.\n- Performance metrics: We test suction power with various debris types and assess obstacle navigation and mapping accuracy.\n- Extra features: When testing robot vacuum and mop combinations, we evaluate their effectiveness at removing stains and overall cleaning quality. We also check how unique features work, like obstacle avoidance and recognition, extendable mop pads, etc.\nTo top it all off, we gauge the device's longevity and long-term performance by using it over the course of a few months. Our review timelines vary, but we typically test robot vacuums for about a month before reviewing and keep our reviews updated while the device is available.\nFor a more detailed look at our testing process, check out our robot vacuum testing methodology page.\nFAQs on robot vacuums\nWhat is the best self-emptying robot vacuum?\nThe technology has come a long way since auto-emptying bases were first introduced. That being said, they all have seemingly worked out the kinks and work well. In our testing experience, we haven't had auto-empty base issues. The only thing we would keep in mind is to make sure your self-emptying base is equipped with disposable bags to capture and hold all of the dirt and debris. It makes cleaning up that much easier and ensures that once the dirt is vacuumed up, it isn't being let back out into your home. Once the bag is full, you'll simply pull it away, throw it in the trash, and put in a brand new bag.\nIs it worth buying a 2-in-1 robot vacuum and mop?\nIn our testing experience, you get what you pay for with two-in-one machines. We don't like robot mops that don't use a cleaning solution. Our floors are dirty enough that simply pushing around water doesn't get anything cleaned. When looking at purchasing a two-in-one machine, be sure to see what the recommended cleaning solution is. If the manufacturer only wants you to use water, we personally would steer clear.\nYou also want to make sure the robot comes with the AI technology that can differentiate carpet from hardwood flooring. It is not worth guarding your favorite rugs every time you use the machine to keep the robot from ruining them. Both Roomba and Roborock do an excellent job of this.\nDo robot vacuums work well on carpets?\nIf you have a lot of carpets and rugs in your home, you will want to look for a robot vacuum with a higher suction power or Pa (Pascal Pressure Unit). The higher the Pa, the better the suction power is."

This is made worse by summer temperatures being at record highs, with heat waves wreaking havoc across various states in the past few weeks. As someone who's gone through a few of these this summer alone, I'm constantly looking for ways to conserve energy.\nThere are many little things you can do that can shave dollars off your monthly energy bill, and they go beyond switching off the lights when you leave the room. Did you know you can save 3% on cooling costs for every 1\u00b0F increase in your thermostat? As a fan of data, I've looked into multiple quantifiable ways to save energy and how these translate into saving money.\nAlso: Apple's tariff costs and iPhone sales are soaring - how long until device prices are too?\nUnplugging a single device when not in use isn't going to save you a bucket of cash. But unplugging multiple devices adds up quickly to help you save, especially when you make a habit of it. Here are the devices you should unplug when they're not in use, and how doing so could save you almost $200 a year, depending on your local rates.\n1. TVs, gaming consoles, and office devices\nIt's easy to forget to unplug TVs that aren't in daily use, but it happens more often than you'd think. This is especially true if you have a TV in a guest room or common area that isn't often occupied. Simply unplugging your TVs when not in use could save you between $2 and $6 a year for each one. As soon as I learned this, I ran to unplug my guest room and office TV.\nSimilarly, a printer left plugged in can cost between $3 and $8 a year when idle. One can consume between 2W and 6W when not in use, adding another good savings option.\nAlso: These jobs face the highest risk of AI takeover, according to Microsoft\nA single gaming console like a PlayStation or Xbox can consume between 1.5W and 10W in standby power, which can cost up to a dollar each month for a device that is not in use. It's a good idea to unplug these devices when you'll be out of the house or overnight, just keep in mind that you may still want to leave them in rest mode so you don't miss an update.\nYou should also consider unplugging sound bars and speakers when not in use, especially in areas that don't get daily use.\n2. Coffee makers and kitchen devices\nUnfortunately, I learned the hard way that my Keurig coffeemaker was driving up my power bill. I kept my Keurig in standby mode, rather than asleep, so it was always ready to brew a cup of coffee. This can consume from 60W and 70W because it has to keep the water warm and ready. This can translate into up to $60 a year.\nAlso: This unexpected robot vacuum made me forget about my $2,000 Roborock\nSimilarly, a mini-fridge can cost you up to $130 a year to run, which doesn't always pay off if you don't need it to run all the time. I used to forget to refill my mini-fridge, so it ended up running empty for weeks, wasting between 50-100W of energy and costing me money. If you have a mini-fridge that you only use seasonally, like in your sunroom during summer months, it's best to unplug it when not in use. Doing so can save you over $10 a month on energy bills.\n3. Smart home devices that are mostly idle\nMost smart home devices are focused on improving energy efficiency, but they can also be vampire devices. Smart devices are always consuming energy because they remain connected to either the internet or another device, like a hub. However, smart devices tend to consume very low phantom loads, so you don't need to rush to unplug them all.\nSmart bulbs and plugs, though small, are always drawing a small amount of power, around 1W. This only costs you between $0.65-$1.30 a year, depending on your local rate, but it can add up if you have multiple of these devices, especially if you don't use them often.\nI have a lot of smart bulbs at home and I kill the switch on the ones that I know we won't be using un the near future. Similarly, I unplug my smart plugs when they don't have a device plugged into them.\nAlso: I let this Segway robot mow my lawn for months - here's why it's been irreplaceable for me\nA smart plug can often save you money on your energy bill. For example, if you have an older Keurig without scheduling capabilities that you'd like to have ready when you wake up, you can put a smart plug on it and schedule it to turn on just an hour a day. I also use my smart plugs to run a grow light for houseplants, a fan, and an older lamp.\n4. Older devices around your home\nMany people still have older devices plugged in that they haven't used in a long time, but either forgot or simply don't think twice about it. A single set-top cable box, DVR, or Blu-ray player can cost you up to $20 a year to power when not in use, depending on your local rates.\nLook around your home and see what is plugged in that doesn't need to be, including alarm clocks, cordless phone bases, electric kettles, hair dryers, and more. Unplugging these devices and only plugging them back in before using them can pay off, even if it's just a few dollars a month.\nFAQs\nMore tips to save on utilities this summer\nEven as the temperatures reach scorching highs, there are many ways to save on your utility bills this summer.\nHere are some things you can do to save money on your energy bills:\n- Run a fan instead of turning down the A/C: Your central air conditioner unit uses between 2,000W and 2,500W when running, while a ceiling fan, for example, uses around 50W. You can set your thermostat between 4-6 degrees higher during the warmer months and use a fan to save energy costs and the life of your A/C unit.\n- Keep the heat out: A warmer house takes more effort to cool, so you should make sure your windows are completely shut and your home is properly insulated. Closing the blinds and adding blackout curtains in some rooms can also maintain a cooler temperature throughout the day.\n- Switch to LED bulbs: I'm sure you've heard this before, but this is a fantastic way to save on your utility bill. LED bulbs use 80-90% less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs and generate less heat.\n- Learn about energy savings through your utility provider: Many providers offer opportunities to save on your energy bills, especially during peak usage days and hours. Find out if your utility provider has a savings program and what you can do to participate in it.\nWhat are vampire devices?\nYou've likely heard about unplugging common household appliances and devices when not in use to save energy. Devices that consume energy even while they're switched off are aptly called 'vampire devices,' and you may have more of them in your home than you think.\nAlso: This thermostat mistake was costing me hundreds: 3 tips to get the best temperature control\nThe US Department of Energy recommends unplugging devices when not in use to reduce phantom loads. Doing so can save you up to 10% on your energy bill, which is a pretty significant amount for such little effort.\nDoes unplugging devices actually save money?\nUnplugging devices can help you save more energy than you'd think, especially if you often forget to switch off appliances like your Keurig. Many of the devices in our homes consume power even if they're not in use, and the key to saving on your energy bills lies in compounding your potential to conserve energy.\nAs someone with a whole-home backup system that sees multiple power outages a year, I make a habit of unplugging devices to save energy. This is even more evident when the power goes out and I go through all my home's circuits using the EcoFlow Smart Home Panel. The EcoFlow app shows me the load that each circuit in my home carries at any given time, and lets me turn them off from my phone.\nAlso: I let this Segway robot mow my lawn for months - here's why it's been irreplaceable for me\nWhen the power goes out, I unplug devices that aren't essential and turn off non-critical circuits. If my home consumes 1.2kWh at any given time, I can easily halve this by unplugging devices and switching off circuits. I unplug anything from smart plugs and lamps to air purifiers and robot vacuums that don't need to be used during a power outage, and I keep my home running with only 330Wh to 600Wh to extend the life of my backup battery.\nGet the best tech tips in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

I compared it with a traditional Wi-Fi router, and here's my advice\nWith the adoption of remote and hybrid working, having a reliable internet connection at home is imperative -- not just for one device, but for several. If you have a family, maybe even dozens. So what's better, one single access point, or a mesh network spread about the home?\nThe answer depends on how your home and office are set up and what kind of connection you need. Wi-Fi routers are so good these days that a single access point is often the most straightforward solution. But if you have a larger home or your office is located far away from your router, a mesh network could be a game-changer, boosting the signal no matter where you are.\nAlso: The best VPN routers of 2025\nIf you're not sure of the difference, that's okay, too. Let's examine both types of connection and consider their pros and cons to determine which one is best for you.\nWhat is a traditional Wi-Fi router?\nA traditional router acts as a central hub for internet connectivity. The router acquires the connection from your internet service provider (ISP), and then allows other devices around the home to connect to it, either via Wi-Fi, or by simply plugging in an Ethernet cable. Typically, routers are password-protected so only your household can connect to it.\nYou should buy a traditional Wi-Fi router if...\n1. You're on a budget\nStandard routers are generally much more affordable than mesh network products. While you can still expect to pay a hundred dollars or more for a premium router, there are many budget-friendly options stable enough to keep your home office running effectively without further input.\n2. You have heavy bandwidth and speed requirements\nMany routers today, such as the TP-Link AXE5400 are designed with the technology needed to meet heavy bandwidth and streaming requirements. Some, like the Asus RT-BE86U, aim to exceed the requirements of most people for the fastest connection possible.\nAlso: Should you upgrade to Wi-Fi 7? Here's my verdict after testing this next-gen router at home\nGamers and live streamers, for example, should generally stick with wired Ethernet connections and traditional routers, as they will likely provide improved speeds and stability over wireless-first products.\n3. You want a plug-and-play product\nA standard router is often less hassle to set up than a mesh network. For something that \"just works,\" a typical router might be the best option. Set it up once, make sure updates are automatically applied, and forget about it.\n4. You want to separate devices and networks\nYou can set up guest Wi-Fi networks on most modern routers, but if you also want to keep all of your devices on a separate home network in the interests of security, most routers will allow you to do this without much hassle.\nWhat is a mesh router?\nWhile traditional routers are singular, centralized access points, mesh networking devices are decentralized.\nInstead of one device connecting to a single gateway to the internet, mesh networks are created from multiple Wi-Fi nodes that all provide web connectivity. For example, you could have a central hub in the kitchen and satellite nodes in the home office, kitchen, and bedroom.\nAlso: This is the fastest and most expensive Wi-Fi router I've ever tested\nWhen you access the internet while in the kitchen, you would automatically connect to the hub, whereas you would jump on a node while you're in your home office, and so on -- and this blanket coverage is why mesh devices are great for larger homes or offices. Most mesh systems will automatically select the best channels and nodes to avoid dead zones and lower the risk of poor connectivity.\nYou should buy a mesh networking system if...\n1. You have spotty coverage in your home\nThe main benefit of a mesh network is extended coverage. Investing in a mesh setup will remove annoyances, such as coverage blackspots or slow connections in larger properties with a lot of square feet. You're far less likely to have dead zones with a mesh system than you are with a single router access point.\nMesh networks can often cover up to 5,000 sq. ft., and more, with enough satellites. That's far more than you can expect from one central router.\n2. You need a reliable connection, no matter where you are\nAs your device will connect to the nearest satellite node rather than a central point of access, this feature helps ensure that -- no matter where you are in a property -- you are less likely to experience connectivity failures or drops.\nAlso: I switched my high-end Wi-Fi 7 router to a more affordable option - and don't regret it\nIn this manner, mesh networks are particularly useful if you have a home office in a garden area separate from your house, for example.\nAnother benefit is that mesh systems and satellites are often designed to look modern, sleek, and may be more discreet than bulky, traditional routers, giving you more options for placement.\n3. You want additional controls\nOnce a mesh network is active, many vendors allow users to control their system through a mobile app. This could include keeping an eye on network traffic, rebooting, or even turning off the internet entirely -- perhaps an appealing prospect for those with children who don't want to mess with a typical router's configuration. In addition, some mesh networks also act as smart hubs and are compatible with voice assistants.\nA note of warning, however: you may need to spend some time tweaking configuration settings when you first set up a mesh network.\nFAQs\nWhat are the disadvantages of using a Wi-Fi router?\nThere are three key disadvantages of using a traditional Wi-Fi router:\nCoverage issues: As internet access is distributed through a single point, this setup can mean that areas far away from your router will have slow or spotty connections that drop. Range extenders can help remove this barrier, and while they can still be cheaper than investing in a mesh network, it's an additional expense.\nOverload: Unless extenders or channel separation features are used, too many connections may result in overloading, bottlenecks, lags, and connectivity drops.\nTweaking: If you want to tweak the more advanced settings on a router, this can often require annoying visits to a platform via desktop, rather than the seamless mobile app connectivity we have learned to enjoy for many of our modern services.\nWhat router system is best for my home office?\nYou need to decide whether the financial outlay for a whole mesh network is worth it. In larger homes with dead spots, mesh networking can provide a way to improve your Wi-Fi signal strength and coverage immediately.\nHowever, it can be expensive to overhaul your existing router setup for a large home. Going for a complete mesh system may be overkill unless you consistently have multiple users and connected devices competing for bandwidth.\nA Wi-Fi extender can be a worthwhile investment instead if you decide to stay with a traditional home router but need to expand coverage.\nSome mesh network systems, such as Google Wifi, Netgear Orbi, and Amazon Eero, are relatively cheap to set up if you don't need too many satellites.\nAlso: The best mesh Wi-Fi routers: Expert recommended\nIf you're the only person using your network and need a stable, powerful internet connection -- such as for resource-hungry work applications or gaming -- a traditional router and an Ethernet cable may be all you need for reliable and rapid internet access. Wired internet speeds should be quicker than wireless if the connection is working properly, and investing in a simple Ethernet cable, easy to find for no more than $10 or $15, could be enough. This could save you the cost of a complete overhaul.\nWi-Fi range extenders, too, could be considered an alternative to mesh if you need to boost coverage and throughput in some areas, and they will likely be less expensive than purchasing individual mesh nodes. Some vendors also offer mesh \"bolt-ons,\" such as Asus' AiMesh, which creates a mesh-like coverage wireless network without ripping everything out and starting again. However, the downside is that you will probably have to spend some time setting these bolt-ons up and tampering with your router's configurations.\nIs mesh Wi-Fi better for gaming?\nThe best way to answer this question is to consider latency. Overall, many mesh systems today trade extended coverage for potential downgrades to speed.\nIf your household has gamers using consoles casually, it shouldn't matter what type of router you use. However, professional and dedicated gamers will absolutely notice small lags or latency issues -- and they will want the best speed and stability available. In these cases, a wired, traditional router is likely your best bet.\nI prefer an Ethernet, cabled connection for PC, Internet-based gaming and sessions with friends, and while my mesh network would probably be adequate, I don't want to risk lagging.\nIs mesh Wi-Fi better than an extender?\nWhile both mesh Wi-Fi and extenders will improve the coverage of your home, there are disadvantages to both.\nMesh systems require investment and the cost can add up quickly, but they provide seamless transitions between Wi-Fi access points dotted around your home. Furthermore, you can rapidly change settings or perform updates via mobile apps.\nWi-Fi extenders can't be tweaked so easily. However, they are cheaper and are the best option if you just want to tackle a few dead zones, as you just need to plug one into your main router. Keep in mind that, unlike mesh nodes, Wi-Fi extenders won't improve congestion or eradicate bottlenecks.\nCheck your ISP first\nBefore changing your setup, you should review your ISP package. If you're subscribed to a low-speed offering, or your internet provider throttles your speed at peak times, new equipment is not going to help. Instead, a package upgrade could be a better option.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

Well, the company has since proved its point: the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable is now available to consumers for an eye-watering $3,300, but packed with premium design elements, solid hardware, and a 120Hz OLED display that extends to almost 17 inches at the press of a button.\nAlso: Lenovo's $3,000 rollable ThinkBook laptop is officially available to buy - know this before you do\nI've been using the ThinkBook Plus for over a week as my main laptop, and I have to admit, I'm enamored by the extendable screen, particularly as a productivity machine for work.\nBut as the first of its kind, it's far from perfect. There are a handful of trade-offs due to the laptop's form, and the sky-high price invites a critical eye to every element of its design. That being said, it is ultimately a well-engineered laptop. Let's take a closer look.\nLike all ThinkBooks, the laptop exudes business, featuring a metallic, two-tone design. It's not my favorite aesthetic, but it's certainly durable and resists fingerprints way better than all the matte black designs out there.\nUpon first glance, the laptop looks like any other. One of the first things to stand out is the thick bezels framing the display, but as your eye draws to the bottom, you notice something strange: there's no bottom bezel -- the screen just continues below the keyboard.\nAlso: How to buy a laptop for school, work, or gaming (and our top picks for each)\nThe rest of the rollable screen is parked underneath, waiting to be unfurled. With the push of a button, the standard-sized display extends upwards, increasing the screen size to 16.7 inches.\nThe result is a large, portrait-style display that goes far beyond any other standard laptop screen size on the market. The glossy, OLED screen delivers a fantastic picture, with no flickering or dimming around the edges, although there is some visible creasing that looks like what you'd see on a foldable phone's display.\nThis is especially true if you rotate the glossy display to reflect the light. It's a little more visible than I expected and certainly something of note (given the price), but ultimately, it doesn't really overshadow the benefit of the large screen.\nFor example, you stop noticing the creasing when your attention is focused on what you're actually doing. It's one of those things that's an inevitable part of its mechanics -- it took foldable phones several years to reduce the creasing on their displays -- and although it doesn't exactly scream \"premium\", it doesn't cancel out the benefits the screen provides.\nAlso: I tried Lenovo's infamous 'rollable' laptop at CES - it's more practical than I thought\nSo what are the said benefits? First off, the extra room is a breath of fresh air. It allows for a spacious workspace that I have to admit, makes for a very nice user experience. Personally, I like running one large, full-screen desktop, but you can also put two windows, one on top of the other, for two 16:9 desktops.\nTo maximize real estate, I set the scale in Windows to 125%, bringing the UI down to a more manageable size that results in a crisp and efficient interface. However, if you want a larger UI, it still feels more roomy than a regular laptop display.\nIf you're a programmer, you'll appreciate the extended portrait orientation, but anyone who works with documents will love being able to see a third more content on the screen at a glance.\nAs an editor, it drastically improves working in Google Docs and my browser-based CMS, both of which benefit from more visibility without having to squint at a UI that's been scaled down to the atomic level.\nEven basic web browsing is improved, with more of the page on the screen at once, and more content visible with less scrolling. In that sense, the display mirrors the mobile layout, which is ultimately more scrollable.\nRolling the screen up can be done by pressing the associated key or with a hand gesture in front of the webcam. While it's extending, the screen defaults to playing an animation (different ones are selectable in settings) with some thematic music, then reloading your desktop once it reaches the desired size. The music can be a little much in a quiet office, so luckily, all of these features can be turned off.\nWhen fully extended, the bottom third of the screen is occupied by the Lenovo widget panel, which shows reminders, your to-do list, and a calendar at a glance. You can pin this to stay permanently on or have it hide behind your other apps.\nThere's actually a lot of content here, including short videos that show how to use gesture controls to raise and lower the display and some suggestions on how to organize the screen more effectively.\nBeyond the display, the rest of the laptop's core components are quite nice. The keyboard is a little shallow, but the keys feel great, with a satisfying click that's crisp and responsive.\nI was also thrilled to find the haptic trackpad to be just as well-engineered, with a uniform click no matter where you press down on the pad, and a sensitive input for swipe gestures. One thing to note, however, is that in cooler temperatures, you might have some trouble with the pad recognizing your fingers, especially if they're cold.\nAlso: The Lenovo ThinkPad streak is over: This model I tested bucks a decade-long trend (for the better)\nAlso note that the laptop's form factor limits its I/O access, with just two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports and a headphone jack. All three ports are located on the left side of the device, which might be problematic for some users, but is an expected trade-off for the features.\nAll in all, the laptop's core physical build feels premium (if a little chunky), and even without the rollable display, it would be a solid office laptop. The fingerprint reader on the power key, along with support for Wi-Fi 7 seal the deal as a modern business device.\nUnder the hood, the Intel Core Ultra 7 \"Lunar Lake\" processor, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage make for a standard hardware loadout comparable to any number of mid-to-upper range business laptops. The big display is powered by an integrated Intel Arc 140V GPU with 16GB of internal memory, supplying more than enough power for daily use.\nCinebench 24 MC | Geekbench 6.2.2 SC | Geekbench 6.2.2 MC | |\nThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable | 563 | 2,732 | 10,701 |\nDell 14 Premium | 732 | 2,626 | 15,462 |\nAcer Swift 16 AI | 518 | 2,743 | 10,932 |\nIf you're looking to game on this laptop, it can handle some mainstream titles, but it's not exactly built for running top-tier gaming content. In \"normal\" laptop mode, you've got a 2000 x 1600 resolution, standard fare for a 14-inch. But if your game supports a 2000 x 2350 resolution, you can play with the screen fully extended, which definitely feels like a unique experience, but because of all the screen space, it isn't exactly optimized for high-APM gaming.\nIf you're playing an older game that doesn't support that resolution, well, the game will simply revert to the traditional resolution, resulting in empty space below the window and negating the whole point of the extended display. The bottom line here: gaming can be a bonus for this laptop, but not what it's made for.\nAlso: Finally, a Windows laptop that I wouldn't mind putting away my MacBook Pro for\nRegarding battery life, the display expectedly cuts into the 66Whr battery's longevity, although not as much as you might expect. During normal use, you can get a full work day of use out of it with the screen extended, but it's cutting it close. If you add in videoconferencing and more demanding workloads, you might not make it through the day without a power top-up.\nThat being said, the Lunar Lake chip does allow for the battery loss to reduce to a trickle when not in use, and it charges fast: about 80% in an hour. In our video playback test, we got a little over 11 hours at half brightness in balanced mode over Wi-Fi.\nSo let's address the elephant in the room: the price. Lenovo is well aware that this laptop is not for everyone. In fact, it's probably the most niche product I've reviewed all year. Instead, it's more about proving a point.\nAlso: I've tested dozens of ThinkPads: Here's the Lenovo model I keep coming back to\nLenovo wants to project a reputation of innovation, but more importantly, it wants to prove it can deliver said products to market. This device reflects that mission, earning it an important place in Lenovo's portfolio, even if it's not the year's top seller.\nIt's also the first iteration of this rollable concept, and as such, the physical design is not quite as polished as you'd find in Lenovo's other high-end laptops, like the ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition or the X1 Carbon. These laptops come from a product line backed up by decades of design and engineering, with the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 having room to improve in subsequent model versions.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 is an impressive product, even considering its trade-offs. The display has visible creases and thick bezels, but when it's fully extended, you forget about them. The battery isn't the best, but it's far from the worst. It's not a stellar gaming rig, but that's not why you buy a ThinkBook, anyway.\nIt's niche, and it's expensive, but it does what it's supposed to: deliver a fantastic user experience in the office, with an expansive, flexible display that looks great, pairs nicely with a premium haptic touchpad, and just the right amount of power under the hood.\nAlso: I switched to the Dell 14 Premium for two weeks, and it made my XPS laptop look bad\nAt $3,200, this isn't a mainstream laptop, and I wouldn't recommend it unless you're absolutely sold on the extendable display and are committed to the form factor in the long term.\nThe reality is that you can get almost anything for less: a MacBook Pro M4 with 24GB of RAM, or the new brand-new Dell 14 Premium with the same processor and an upgraded Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU for $1,000 less. But if you're in love with the big screen, I can say that it's a productivity game-changer in the office."
