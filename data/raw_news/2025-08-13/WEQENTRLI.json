  "content": "In recent trading, shares of MGIC Investment Corp. (Symbol: MTG) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $19.19, changing hands for $19.33/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher \u2014 if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.\n\nThere are 8 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for MGIC Investment Corp. , but the average is just that \u2014 a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $18.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $21.00. The standard deviation is $1.066.\n\nBut the whole reason to look at the average MTG price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with MTG crossing above that average target price of $19.19/share, investors in MTG have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $19.19 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover MGIC Investment Corp. :\n\nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

We show 40 historical shares outstanding datapoints in our SGU shares outstanding history coverage, used to compute SGU market cap on those dates. Understanding the changing numbers of shares outstanding, the changing share price, and the resulting changing SGU market cap history over the course of time is important for investors interested in comparing SGU's market cap history versus its peers. Many \"beginner\" or \"novice\" investors will look at one stock trading at a price of $10 per share and another trading at a price of $20 per share and think the latter company is worth twice as much. Of course, that is a completely meaningless comparison without also knowing how many shares outstanding there are for each of the two companies, and then calculating their respective market caps. Comparing the share price of SGU versus a peer is one thing; comparing SGU market cap versus a peer is a completely different story. Furthermore, via fluctuation both in per-share price and in the number of shares outstanding (via issuance of new shares over time, the repurchase of existing shares), the market cap for a company like SGU can fluctuate over the course of history.
