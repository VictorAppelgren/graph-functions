      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid, high‑level narrative but falls short of Argos’ “action‑over‑prose” standard in a few key ways. 1) **Citation gaps** – statements about the 4,200‑level psychological barrier, the 86 %/53 % Fed‑cut probabilities, and the 4,150 support level lack inline IDs; add (VDO8D9T7M) or (QJEVQZHQR) for the Fed futures and a source that cites the 4,200/4,150 levels (e.g., the Nasdaq article). 2) **Drift** – the mention of the Jaguar rebrand (“unlikely to materially impact the index”) is a tangential point; either tie it explicitly to S&P exposure (e.g., Jaguar’s weight in the index is <0.1 %) or drop it. 3) **Quantification** – replace vague “likely trigger a risk reversal” with a concrete range (e.g., a 50‑point drop to 4,150 would trigger a 30‑bp risk‑off shift). 4) **First‑principles grounding** – explicitly link the GDP revision (+3.3 %) to a 0.5‑point upside bias in the S&P, and the 0.2 % drop in initial claims to a 0.2‑point support. 5) **Catalyst window** – state the next 0–3‑week window (e.g., 28‑08‑2025 to 08‑09‑2025) and key dates (Fed meeting 16‑17 Sep, tariff announcement 13 Aug). 6) **Actionable direction** – finish with a concise recommendation: “Hold S&P 500; target 4,250–4,300 if GDP and claims remain positive; exit if tariff escalation >15 % or Fed signals a dovish cut.” 7) **Citation density** – ensure every substantive claim (e.g., Porsche CEO search, Dollar General earnings) has an inline ID.  Implement these edits to meet the 100‑topic capacity, pillar diversification, and elite bar requirements.",
