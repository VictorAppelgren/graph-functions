  "title": "Did McLaren favor Lando Norris over Oscar Piastri in Hungary? Why the team says no",
  "description": "A bold strategy, worn tires and rising tension \u2014 Norris\u2019s win showed just how fine the margin is in McLaren\u2019s title fight",
  "content": "The odds seemed to be stacked against Lando Norris on Sunday as Oscar Piastri hunted him down at the 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix, trying to overcome different McLaren strategies and a 12-second gap after his Australian teammate made a second pit stop.\n\nNorris opted for a Hail Mary one-stop strategy when race engineer Will Joseph floated the idea mid-race. As the final laps unfolded, he had older tires and was racing in dirty air as they caught up to traffic with no DRS assistance. Piastri was quickly closing the gap, getting it within eight-tenths of a second with five laps to go.\n\nIt was a close battle, and the McLaren teammates came close to contact when Piastri locked up as he made a dive at Turn 1 on the penultimate lap. He was right on Norris\u2019s tail and was told by his race engineer to \u201cremember how we go racing\u201d just beforehand. But, in the end, the Briton brought home McLaren\u2019s 200th grand prix victory as he finished 0.698 seconds ahead.\n\nMcLaren navigated the race wisely to secure a maximum result, extending its already giant constructors\u2019 championship lead. But from the drivers\u2019 championship perspective, the last race before Formula One\u2019s summer shutdown feels like a defining moment in their close battle.\n\nThe gap between them sits at nine points, Piastri having the edge.\n\nHow Norris went from fifth to a narrow win\n\nNorris didn\u2019t look like he had a shot at winning by the end of the first lap of 70. He had a solid start, but so did pole sitter Charles Leclerc. As the grid barreled toward Turn 1, Piastri moved left, and Norris hoped he would go the other way instead.\n\nNorris caught a slipstream from his teammate before pulling to the right, while Piastri stayed in Leclerc\u2019s slipstream, gaining more speed, with the leading pair then moving right, squeezing off Norris\u2019s line. He then slid backwards, sitting fifth by the end of Lap 1. When asked about the start, Norris revealed he\u2019d been sarcastic alone in the cockpit, uttering \u201cbrilliant\u201d to himself, crossing the line.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d watched quite a few videos of lap one to Turn 1,\u201d he continued. \u201cClearly, it didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nNorris had the pace, though, as he began another recovery drive. Joseph suggested line changes to help with specific corner time losses \u2013 most notably at Turn 2 \u2013 to gain more speed. It\u2019s these types of small details that build first a lap, then a stint. But being stuck in George Russell\u2019s turbulent air while chasing third, particularly on this short and twisty track, proved to be a challenge.\n\nBy Lap 22, Norris was in the lead. He\u2019d not pitted while the other leaders were diving in for their first stops. With no chance to undercut Russell, he opted for more tire delta and extended his stint, eventually making the medium tires last for 31 laps. Later came the conversation about the one-stop Hail Mary.\n\nJoseph asked over the radio, \u201cKeen for it?\u201d Norris replied, \u201cYeah, why not?\u201d\n\nNorris explained after the race that \u201cit wasn\u2019t a terrible thought that I can make the hards last until the end. I just knew I\u2019d have to push flat out for basically every single lap. That\u2019s when it gets a little bit tricky. The tires get hot. It\u2019s easy to make mistakes.\n\n\u201cI knew I could make the tires get to the end quite easily, but it was (harder) to stay ahead of the others.\u201d\n\nWhen the one-stopper was proposed, Norris led Leclerc by five seconds and Piastri by seven, as they lapped quicker on their fresher tires. Even if a two-stop strategy went perfectly from there, Norris knew his chances were slim to fight for a win without either a safety car or a strategy gamble.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t necessary. Norris emerged from his Lap 31 stop to take hard tires, facing a 19-second gap to the lead. When Leclerc pitted again nine laps later, he\u2019d cut this to 14. With 25 laps to go, Norris moved back into the lead while Piastri took his second and final pit stop \u2013 Russell also having pitted out of his way. Then it was a case of managing his tires and navigating traffic until the end, even as Piastri roared back.\n\n\u201cMy confidence wasn\u2019t the highest, but it was my best chance of trying to do something,\u201d Norris said of the one-stopper. \u201cIt turned out to be a little bit trickier, but it actually allowed me to fight until the very end for the win.\n\n\u201cNot sure it still felt like the best strategy, but I think with how difficult overtaking was, it turned out to be pretty good.\u201d\n\nWhy Piastri stuck with the \u2018optimal\u2019 strategy\n\nEvery team discusses the various strategy options pre-race, and going into the Budapest contest, the two-stop option was the optimal choice. McLaren discussed the one-stop option, Piastri said, so he knew \u201cit wasn\u2019t completely off the table.\u201d But it didn\u2019t think a one-stop strategy would be possible.\n\n\u201cWe convinced ourselves that the one-stop was starting to get in the game as we progressed with the first stint,\u201d McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like entering the race with a one or a two stop (both possible), and we would have picked the equivalent. We thought that the two-stop would be the dominant strategy.\u201d\n\nWhat muddies the waters is that Norris was ahead of Piastri. The Australian driver emphasized that it\u2019s \u201cvery difficult to know from the cockpit what is going to be the best thing to do.\u201d\n\nThe McLaren duo started on the back foot after Leclerc bested them surprisingly to snare pole. It\u2019s notoriously difficult to overtake at the Hungaroring, and pit stops are often required to execute a pass. McLaren tried to pit Piastri early on Lap 18 to get ahead of Leclerc at the first stint\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t obvious that we just had enough pace to blow past him and go and win that way,\u201d Piastri said of his strategy. \u201cFor Lando, there was virtually nothing to lose by trying a one-stop race. For myself, potentially there was.\u201d\n\nPiastri was asked to consider a one-stopper early in his second stint, but he committed to a two-stop race, his eyes set on catching his championship rival and teammate. His radio message when told the gap to Leclerc, before being called into the pits for a second stop, showed where Piastri\u2019s mindset was: the championship.\n\nIn the end, Ferrari thwarted McLaren\u2019s second attempt at an undercut when Leclerc stopped again on Lap 40. Piastri then used tires that were five laps younger to blast past him with a bold move around Turn 1\u2019s outside. He set off in his Norris pursuit, but came up short.\n\n\u201cI knew that I was catching him a lot when I had clean air, but as soon as I got close, it was incredibly tough to stay close enough,\u201d Piastri explained. \u201cEven if I had more laps, I\u2019m not sure the result would have been any different. But I certainly tried.\u201d\n\nHow McLaren manages the battle from here\n\nF1 has seen relationships turn sour when teammates battle \u2013 whether it\u2019s for a win or the championship. Tensions flare and boil over, and rash decisions are made. But McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown isn\u2019t worried about any fallout between Piastri and Norris \u201cbecause of the communication, trust and respect we all have and they have for each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate to have the two personalities that we have,\u201d Brown said before Sunday\u2019s race. \u201cWe love the challenge. We like it. We talk about it. It\u2019s not the elephant in the room. We meet every Sunday morning after we\u2019ve seen how qualifying is going. They know each other\u2019s strategy. We\u2019re totally transparent.\u201d\n\nBrown has spoken with both drivers individually about whether they\u2019ve ticked each other off at times, when there are \u201cwindows of opportunity.\u201d The answer has been no from both. The competition is heating up, but it\u2019s not hostile. Brown said, \u201cWe\u2019re not feeling any tension. As the championship builds, I\u2019m sure that tension will grow,\u201d and the team does expect them to clash again like they did in Montreal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m positive they\u2019re never going to run each other off the track, and that\u2019s where you get into bad blood. So they\u2019re free to race. There are rules around our racing, which is \u2018respect your teammate.\u2019 They know that,\u201d Brown said, later adding, \u201cIf something bubbles up, we\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d\n\nPiastri\u2019s one attempt at passing Norris on Sunday is an example of what Stella described as \u201cfirm\u201d and \u201cfair\u201d racing between them. Stella added, \u201cAt the same time, it was definitely within our principles. We had a bit of a lock-up with Oscar. But at the same time, Lando left some space because he knew that Oscar would have been at the limit of braking.\u201d\n\nBut the move may have come too early for Piastri. He said after the race that he likely \u201cneeded to be at least a couple of tenths closer (for the pass to come off), which was going to take a mistake from Lando to achieve that.\u201d\n\nMcLaren is on a dominant streak, with Norris and Piastri securing four consecutive 1-2 finishes to close out the first portion of the season. It has won 11 out of the 14 grands prix, with Norris taking five wins to Piastri\u2019s six. McLaren\u2019s gap to the rest of the grid is well over 200 points, and while the drivers are just nine points apart, third-place Max Verstappen is nearly 100 points behind Norris in the drivers\u2019 standings.\n\nQuestions of fairness will keep arising in a one-team title fight. And Norris and Piastri have diverged on race strategies in the two most recent races. There\u2019s always a risk that things could go wrong in such scenarios.\n\n\u201cWe want to give our two drivers the possibility to utilize, express their talent, pursue their aspirations, their personal success, and business to happen within the boundaries of the team interest and the fairness, the sportsmanship, and the respect for one another,\u201d Stella said. \u201cFor me, this is what I see. When we have a deviating strategy, when we have different options, I think this is part of racing.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that neither driver is surprised, and I think neither driver was surprised. So far, I can only be very grateful to the way Lando and Oscar have interpreted the way we go racing as a team, as a group, which includes the drivers, and I\u2019m sure this is going to be the same until the end of the season.\u201d",

      "text": "Lando Norris survived a tense final few laps to win Formula One\u2019s 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday, holding off Oscar Piastri and closing the gap on his McLaren teammate to just nine points in their championship battle.\nFerrari driver Charles Leclerc was in first for much of the race but suffered a dramatic loss of performance in the final stages, ultimately taking him off the podium.\nAdvertisement\nLeclerc led the first stint from pole, as Norris briefly dropped back to fifth, eventually getting stuck behind Mercedes driver George Russell in fourth.\nThis changed Norris\u2019 race. He had to run longer after the first round of pit stops, which Piastri kicked off on lap 18 in a failed bid to overturn Leclerc\u2019s early advantage. After Leclerc and Russell came in on the next lap, Norris then switched onto an audacious one-stop strategy.\nHe led for much of the next phase of the race before finally stopping on lap 31. Norris then unleashed strong pace to catch up to Russell, before Leclerc became the first leader to stop again on lap 40, where McLaren gave Piastri the chance to build a tire life offset delta.\nNorris got by Russell when the Mercedes stopped before Piastri finally came in for more hard tires on lap 45, which he used to quickly close in on and pass Leclerc with a thrilling move at Turn 1\u2019s outside.\nThis set Piastri with a challenge to overturn an eight-second gap to Norris over the race\u2019s final stretch \u2014 the difference between the pair was down from the 12 seconds after Piastri\u2019s second stop. As the McLaren drivers dodged lapped cars and Leclerc fell back into Russell\u2019s clutches \u2014 the Ferrari driver was furious with his team over its strategy and car setup \u2014 Piastri cut his teammate\u2019s lead to under two seconds heading into the final laps.\nThe gap came down under a second in a tense finale, with Piastri having a big, locked-up lunge at Turn 1 on the penultimate lap, but Norris held on to win by just 0.6 seconds.\nRussell passed Leclerc to take third after some feisty defending from the Ferrari driver, which earned Leclerc a penalty, with Fernando Alonso and Gabriel Bortoleto far behind in fifth and sixth. In the race\u2019s other notable moment, Lewis Hamilton (12th) went off the track in a tight clash with Max Verstappen, who produced many great passes on his way to ninth. The incident was investigated after the race, but no punishment was deemed necessary.\nThe Athletic\u2019s experts, Luke Smith and Madeline Coleman, analyze the main talking points.\nA weekend of contrasts for Leclerc and Hamilton\nLeclerc\u2019s qualifying magic on Saturday may have given Ferrari a first pole position of the season to celebrate, but its car just didn\u2019t have enough to convert that into a first 2025 grand prix win on a weekend of contrasts across the Scuderia\u2019s garage.\nLeclerc retained the lead at the start, arguably Piastri\u2019s best chance to get ahead, and maintained his advantage through the opening stint, even as Piastri tried to undercut him. But Piastri\u2019s later tire delta gave the McLaren the pace needed to get a move done shortly after the second round of stops. This, combined with Norris jumping ahead on the one-stop, relegated Leclerc to third place.\nAdvertisement\nThe Mon\u00e9gasque driver was pretty direct in his frustration, saying Ferrari needed to listen to him and that it would be a \u201cmiracle\u201d if he finished on the podium after falling far behind Piastri, losing as much as two seconds per lap through this phase. Russell was left upset by Leclerc\u2019s defensive moves once he arrived behind the Ferrari, believing that the penalty Leclerc later got for \u201cerratic driving\u201d \u2014 per the FIA stewards\u2019 documentation \u2014 was deserved. But Russell had ultimately got ahead for third place with a lunge in the final stages.\nLeclerc, at least, was in the fight for some silverware, unlike Hamilton, whose miserable weekend never saw him earnestly contend for points. His race was defined by his Q2 exit on Saturday, after which he called himself \u201cuseless\u201d and said Ferrari should \u201cchange the driver\u201d in his car, serving as another low in his first season with the Italian team.\nStarting on hard tyres, he was always committed to a long first stint, but couldn\u2019t make much progress, instead spending the opening stint largely staring at the rear of Kimi Antonelli\u2019s Mercedes.\nIt will go down as a weekend of missed opportunities for Ferrari, especially from the high of Leclerc\u2019s pole on Saturday.\nLuke Smith\nLando Norris wins with a Hail Mary strategy\nTwelve months on at the Hungarian Grand Prix, as McLaren managed drivers running first and second, there was a small sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Piastri was chasing down Norris, but this time the tension was different: they really were racing hard.\nNorris had made life more difficult than it needed to be at the start, boxing himself in behind Piastri by taking the inside line and allowing Russell and Alonso to get past him. Although Norris could quickly get back by the Aston Martin, he was then left to struggle in Russell\u2019s dirty air for much of the first stint.\nAdvertisement\nNorris was released into clean air after the leading trio had pitted, and as he began to eke his tires out, the one-stop strategy came into play. \u201cKeen for it?\u201d asked race engineer Will Joseph, offering Norris a Hail Mary win shot. \u201cYeah, why not?\u201d replied Norris.\nIt actually put Norris into the pound seat for victory, giving him track position on a circuit where overtaking is such a challenge. Piastri was committed to the two-stop and made clear to his engineer he was more concerned about beating Norris, his championship rival, than necessarily stopping with optimum timing to undercut Leclerc successfully at the second services.\nNorris rose back to the lead with 25 laps to go after Piastri\u2019s final stop, knowing he\u2019d be caught up and have to manage his tires carefully to the very end. It went right to the final few laps, Norris doing all he could to hold on, with a pack of traffic ahead giving him dirty air and no DRS assistance, which his teammate successfully reached. Piastri attempted his dive-bomb on the penultimate lap into Turn 1 \u2014 locking up and narrowly avoiding contact. It was reminiscent of their battle in Austria, where Norris also prevailed.\nThe lock-up meant that by the final lap, Piastri was too far back to get Norris, leaving the Briton to cling on and secure a significant victory for his title hopes, going into the summer break with three wins in the last four races.\nIn Hungary, credit must go to McLaren for managing the race smartly and turning a 2-4 from the first stint into a 1-2 finish. It was also a good insight into the brewing championship fight between Piastri and Norris. Yes, relations remain cordial, but both are fiercely determined to beat one another to the title going into the final 10 races of the season.\nLuke Smith\nAnonymous Red Bull\nWhen speaking with the Dutch media after qualifying Saturday, Verstappen made a brutally honest remark: He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll win a race again this season, and he is probably right. He said, \u201cI can\u2019t make more of it.\u201d\nHungaroring put one of Red Bull\u2019s weaknesses in the spotlight. The RB21 has struggled in the low-speed corners this season, which is a big quality of this circuit, and the balance issues that have long been present in the car were very prominent. Throughout practice, Verstappen reported that he was lacking grip, and he said this remained the same in qualifying. The big question was whether there was an identified issue but he said there wasn\u2019t.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThis weekend, from lap one, just felt off. We threw the car around a lot, and nothing really gave the direction,\u201d Verstappen later said. \u201cThat is the biggest problem because when you change a lot from the setup, it will always give you positives or negatives, and ours was just\u2026 nothing worked. It was just going round in circles. Nothing gave you any kind of idea of what to do.\u201d\nVerstappen still made daring overtaking moves to claw his way through the order, especially after he exited the pit lane into traffic having been committed to the two-stopper by Red Bull. He was already struggling with his medium tires by lap 11, when he was behind Bortoleto, and the Dutchman pitted for fresh hard tires several laps later.\nHe rose back by Nico H\u00fclkenberg and Pierre Gasly for P12, and the Red Bull driver later made a bold move on Hamilton for P11, one that left the Ferrari driver going off track. The stewards investigated the incident after the race, with the television replays not conclusively showing contact occurring between them. But the investigation found there was no contact, with Hamilton even choosing not to attend the hearing into the matter.\nThe flurry of final pit stops helped Verstappen, as he moved up to fifth by lap 45, but here he faced a notable 22-second gap to Russell, who was on fresher tires. By lap 48, that gap was 26 seconds. Verstappen then made his second stop a lap later and ultimately ended up in ninth.\nThis won\u2019t be the last track this season where Red Bull will struggle. After all, Singapore is another low-speed circuit. Verstappen finished second, 20 seconds behind Norris, in last year\u2019s race there.\nMadeline Coleman\nAnother strong race for Bortoleto\nSauber has managed to turn around its form after its severe struggles last season and in the early stages of 2025. Bortoleto did not take the surprise podium that H\u00fclkenberg secured at Silverstone, but he has starred among the rookie class since Sauber\u2019s car upgrades got it back into F1\u2019s midfield fight. He was in the thick of the points action again during the Hungarian GP.\nAfter winning the 2024 Formula Two championship, his F1 debut didn\u2019t start great. He crashed out in Australia, then endured a series of poor finishes, ending P19 in Japan and securing consecutive P18 finishes in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia before retiring again in Miami.\nIt wasn\u2019t until the Austrian weekend in June that the rookie scored his first points, bringing home four with an eighth-place finish \u2014 and notably ending up ahead of teammate H\u00fclkenberg. But it\u2019s become evident that Bortoleto is starting to find a rhythm, outqualifying H\u00fclkenberg and advancing to Q3 in Belgium last weekend and doing the same at Hungaroring. Bortoleto even managed to outqualify Verstappen on Saturday.\nAdvertisement\nBortoleto briefly looked to be in trouble early on during the grand prix, after he was noted for a possible false start, but he was cleared, while H\u00fclkenberg received a penalty for the same offense. After starting seventh, Bortoleto made his way up a spot by Lap 2 and was still there after the final pit stops were made, as he and Alonso (his manager) joined Norris in making the tricky one-stopper work well.\nIt was a relatively quiet but clean race for the rookie, where he secured his best finish of his F1 career to date: a crucial P6, which brought home eight points for Sauber. Bortoleto now has secured three points finishes across four weekends, and his sixth-place finish marks Sauber\u2019s sixth consecutive weekend coming away with points.\nMadeline Coleman\nProvisional race results (Top 10)\n- Lando Norris, McLaren\n- Oscar Piastri, McLaren\n- George Russell, Mercedes\n- Charles Leclerc, Ferrari\n- Fernando Alonso, Aston Martin\n- Gabriel Bortoleto, Sauber\n- Lance Stroll, Aston Martin\n- Liam Lawson, Racing Bulls\n- Max Verstappen, Red Bull\n- Kimi Antonelli, Mercedes\n(Top photo: Bradley Collyer/PA Images/Getty Images)"
