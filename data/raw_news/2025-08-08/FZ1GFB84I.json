  "title": "10 Foods You Shouldn't Cook in Your Instant Pot",
  "description": "Pressure-cooking these 10 foods can, at best, lead to disappointment and disaster. Read this to find out which 10 foods and dishes you should not make in an Instant Pot.",
  "content": "The Instant Pot is an incredibly versatile appliance. These multicookers come in handy for a wide range of recipes, especially in the summer when you don't want to turn the oven on or spend time in front of the stove. With an Instant Pot, you can pressure cook, slow cook, reheat leftovers, make rice, steam and even make yogurt. But there are limits to its power, and some foods don't fare well in the machine. To save you time, money and ingredients, we've compiled this list of food you should never cook in the Instant Pot.\n\nHere are 10 food items and recipes you should never cook in your Instant Pot.\n\nAnd for more cooking tips, check out nine cooking hacks that actually work, why you might be ruining your chef's knife and the top slow cooker mistakes to avoid.\n\nIn general, seafood such as fish, oysters, shrimp, mussels and clams is just too delicate for pressure cooking and slow cooking modes. They are foods that are meant to be cooked quickly at just the right temperature, which is hard to do with an Instant Pot. A few seconds too long or at the wrong temperature, and you can end up with mush or rubbery lumps.\n\nBesides, fish, shellfish and crustaceans are easily cooked with other methods, so breaking out the Instant Pot for them won't guarantee better results as it can for tougher meats.\n\nThe only exception is octopus and squid. Pressure cooking these tough creatures can make them tender while keeping the meat juicy. Just be sure to find a recipe that is specifically for the Instant Pot.\n\nUnless you've purchased a specialty model, your Instant Pot is not a pressure fryer and isn't designed for the higher temperatures needed to heat cooking oil for something like crispy fried chicken. Of course, an Instant Pot is perfect for a dish like carnitas, but to get the final crisp on the meat, after you remove the meat from the Instant Pot, transfer it to a skillet and brown for a few minutes or on a baking sheet to crisp up in a hot oven. (However, if you're looking for an air fryer that will get your food nice and crispy, you can check out our tested picks for the best air fryers of 2025).\n\nJust like in a slow cooker, most dairy products such as cheese, milk and sour cream will curdle in an Instant Pot, no matter if you use the pressure cooking setting or the slow cooking setting. Add these ingredients after the dish cooks or avoid making the recipe in the Instant Pot altogether.\n\nThere are two exceptions. One is when you're making yogurt, and that's only if you use a recipe specifically for an Instant Pot. The other is if you're making a cheesecake, and again, only if you're following an Instant Pot recipe.\n\nWhile you technically can cook pasta in an Instant Pot, it may come out gummy or unevenly cooked. Honestly, unless you don't have the option, boiling the pasta in a pot on a stovetop is just as fast and easy and will yield consistently better cooked pasta.\n\nRead more: No, Salted Water Doesn't Boil Faster and 7 Other Pasta Myths\n\nTwo recipes at once\n\nCooking a roast with potatoes and carrots is a time-honored recipe, right? Not in this case. Don't try to cook a main dish with a side dish in your Instant Pot. They may fit in the pot together, but each food will need its own cooking time. Cooking items together will inevitably result in a dry or mushy mess.\n\nYou aren't really baking a cake in an Instant Pot, you're steaming it. The cake will be moist -- which works for something like bread pudding -- but you won't get a nice crust on the cake or the chewy edges that everyone fights over with baked brownies. However, if you do need to throw something together for a potluck or quick family dessert, you can get a moist sponge in half an hour or so, excluding prep time.\n\nCanning, the art of cooking and sealing foods in jars, is often done in a pressure cooker. So, it may seem like a good idea to make a batch of jams, pickles or jellies in your Instant Pot. Don't do it.\n\nWith an Instant Pot, you're not able to monitor the temperature of what you're canning as you would with a regular pressure cooker. With canning, cooking and sealing the food correctly is key. Improper cooking and sealing can lead to bacteria growth that can cause food poisoning.\n\nWhile you want to avoid canning with an Instant Pot, some of the newer models (like the Duo Plus) do have a sterilize setting that lets you clean baby bottles and kitchen items like jars and utensils.\n\nA pressure cooker is not a barbecue. An Instant Pot does great with tougher cuts of meat -- which the pressure cooker can easily break down -- but not so good with ones that are best eaten medium-rare, like a steak. Save those for the grill.\n\nWe love lentils, but not all of them can be cooked in an Instant Pot. Brown and green lentils can hold up to pressure cooking, but the more delicate yellow and red versions turn to mush because they cook so quickly. Unless you're purposely making lentil soup or dhal, stick to cooking red and yellow lentils on the stove to preserve their texture and shape.\n\nCookies are another baked food that doesn't work when made in the Instant Pot, either on pressure cooker or slow cooker mode. Instead, try your luck with convection heat by way of a wall oven, toaster or air fryer.",

      "text": "When it comes to cooking, it may feel like there's nothing new under the sun (your air fryer and Instant Pot can only do so much). However, social media apps like TikTok and Instagram are helping people rediscover useful tips and tricks in the kitchen. These cooking hacks tend to go viral since they often save time or money and sometimes give another use to some kitchen tool you thought was a one-trick pony. But the real question is, do they actually work?\nWe wanted to uncover what happens when there are no lights, cameras and action, but just a home cook trying something new, or just someone who wants to get into cooking. So we reached out to chef instructor Kierin Baldwin from the Institute of Culinary Education for her expert opinion on which cooking hacks are actually helpful and which are best left on your phone.\nFor more helpful tips in the kitchen, find out how to protect yourself from a leaky gas stove, how to store cheese so it lasts longer and how to store leftovers so they stay fresher longer.\n1. Use a wine bottle as a rolling pin\nYou were certain you had a rolling pin, but it's nowhere to be seen and you'd never have begun this pizza dough, sugar cookie or cinnamon roll project without one. So\u2026now what? A wine bottle can rescue both your dough and your nerves in one handy package.\n\"It works!\" said Baldwin, who points out that a wine bottle even comes with its own tapered handle. You'll want to make sure the bottle is clean but otherwise roll as you would with a traditional rolling pin; no need to coat the surface with anything special. \"I think it would drive me nuts though,\" Baldwin adds, \"because it's so much shorter than a normal rolling pin. I would only do it in extreme circumstances.\" As rolling pins are low-maintenance and inexpensive kitchen tools, if you find yourself using this hack more often than not, it's probably time to invest in the real thing.\n2. Peel garlic by shaking it in a jar\nAs a home cook, the utility of this hack might come down to your need for multiple cloves of garlic all at once, but according to Baldwin: \"I gotta tell you, it works great. In a lot of the restaurants that I worked in, the prep guys would actually put two small pans together and shake a bunch of garlic cloves in order to peel them.\"\nIf it's good enough for restaurant cooks, it's certainly good enough for home cooks. Rather than smashing individual garlic cloves with the side of your knife to loosen the skins -- or fruitlessly trying to pick them off with your fingernails -- all you need is a jar with a lid, or two small metal bowls inverted together. Add garlic cloves, shake vigorously, and voil\u00e0! Perfectly peeled garlic without the lingering, tell-tale aroma beneath your fingernails.\n3. Use dental floss to cut cheese or baked goods\nYou shouldn't try this with just anything you'd typically need a knife for. But when it comes to slicing certain creamy foods, such as cheesecake or goat cheese, dental floss is the answer. It's so thin, it doesn't create drag like the blade of a knife would, and slices come out cleanly with just a simple loop and pull of the floss. \"It's also really great if you're making cinnamon rolls or something like that,\" said Baldwin, since not only does dental floss create clean slices, but it won't smush or flatten softer items during the cutting process.\nAs for the quality of the floss, \"you might not want to use mint,\" she said. You should employ straightforward, waxed floss rather than the extra-textured varieties. \"But pretty much anything else is fine.\"\nRead more: Stop Cutting Cake With a Knife. Here's a Way That's Faster and Cleaner\n4. Dice or mash with a cooling rack\n\"This is actually one of my favorite hacks,\" said Baldwin, who doesn't necessarily recommend it for foods that require a uniform, cleanly sliced look, but for when the end result is going to be a puree. Pressing your item through a gridded cooling rack not only breaks down whatever you're mashing, but it also has an added, peeling bonus.\n\"If I'm roasting squash and am going to end up pureeing it, you just take it -- skin side up -- smash it right on the cooling rack, and it separates it from the skin really easily,\" said Baldwin. \"Or if I were making guacamole or something with an avocado, it's a great way to get the avocado out of the skin,\" also breaking it down to smashable chunks in one effort.\n5. Add oil to your pasta water to prevent sticking\nThe best way to prevent noodles from congealing while cooking is to make sure you're using a large enough pot with an appropriate amount of water, and not forgetting to stir along the way.\nWhat if you've been taught to add some oil to the water to ensure individual strands of spaghetti? \"I do it all the time,\" said Baldwin. \"I know chefs who say it doesn't work, but it kind of does.\" The oil has to be in the water before the pasta, however, so the noodles pass through the skim of oil and get a little coating on their way to the water bath.\nBonus pasta hack: Stick a wooden spoon across the top can keep your pasta water from boiling over and spilling all on the stovetop.\n6. Use deli lids to cut through multiple round items at once\nIf you're losing minutes of your day on the regular by individually slicing spherical items such as cherry tomatoes or grapes, this hack is for you.\n\"Basically you put one lid on your work surface right side up, put a layer of whatever you're cutting on top of the lid, and then invert a second lid on top of that,\" said Baldwin, \"then slide your knife horizontally in between the two lids to cut everything in half all at once. It's so much quicker than cutting each one individually.\"\nIf you don't have any deli containers lying around from the grocery store or last week's delivery, Amazon sells them for real cheap.\n7. Freeze individual portions in ice cube trays\nThe internet would have you freezing individual portions of sauces such as pesto in ice cube trays, but Baldwin believes it's a better trick for specific components that usually come in larger quantities than a single recipe calls for. \"Two that come immediately to mind are chipotles in adobo and tomato paste,\" said Baldwin. \"I usually just use a small amount and then freeze the rest, and freezing things in ice cube-sized quantities makes it so much easier to use up bit by bit.\" Homemade chicken stock is another great candidate for freezing in ice cube trays. As is leftover wine (I know, I know: what is leftover wine?) to use the next time you're whipping together a sauce on the range.\nIf you don't already have some, snag trays in different sizes since you may want certain leftover ingredients in larger or smaller portions when the time comes. Upstart kitchen brand Anytime makes a line of trays for freezing liquid and solid foods made from food-grade silicone with steel frames so they won't crack as easily as plastic.\n8. Keep ginger in the freezer for easy grating\n\"I haven't actually diced ginger in I don't know how many years because it's a total pain,\" said Baldwin, but she's certainly not advocating for a ginger-less existence. \"I just keep it in the freezer,\" she said, \"and whenever I need some, I take out the microplane and just grate however much I need.\" According to Baldwin, with this method, you don't even need to bother peeling the ginger when it's frozen, a winning hack for anyone with less than fond memories of battling ginger's knobby form with a spoon. \"It's so much easier than any other way,\" she said.\n9. Cut pizza with scissors\nIf you never quite got the hang of using a pizza cutter, or if your gorgeous, homemade pies end up mangled during the slicing process, it may be simply a matter of thinking beyond the knife when it comes to cutting pizza. Culinary scissors are the way forward here. \"Just make sure they're clean scissors, and that they're ones that have the hinge that comes completely apart for proper cleaning,\" said Baldwin. In other words, do not attempt this with scissors straight from your craft drawer. If you want to get high-tech, the kitchen gear innovators at Dreamfarm have created the Scizzas, a pair of scissors designed specifically for portioning out pizza.\nAs for whether any of the hacks that promise tear-free onion cutting have merit? \"If you're crying, it probably is a sign that you just need to sharpen your knife,\" said Baldwin.\nMore home tips to keep the kitchen humming\n- You're Using Your Chef's Knife Wrong.

      "text": "If you cook at home regularly, you probably rely on a favorite kitchen knife to make meal prep smoother. But even the best blades can lose their edge faster than you'd think if you're unknowingly mishandling them. A few common habits can dull or even permanently damage your knives, no matter how much you paid for them.\nDragging the blade sideways to scrape chopped ingredients off a cutting board, storing knives loose in a drawer, or sharpening too often can all take a toll. Even rinsing them and letting them air-dry instead of drying them by hand can lead to rust or corrosion over time. These missteps might seem minor, but they can shave years off your knife's life.\nThe good news? Avoiding these habits doesn't take much effort. A few small changes in how you use, store and clean your knives can make a huge difference. With just a bit of care, your blades can stay sharper longer and keep performing like new.\nIf you're in search of a fantastic new knife, we've got great news. We've tried out more than 10 different options and put together a list of the best chef's knives for 2025. If you already have a knife that's your No. 1, continue reading to find out the most common mistakes people make that can ruin even the most high-quality knife.\nRead more: Want Your Kitchen Knives to Stay Sharp for Longer? This Simple Trick Will Help\n7 easy ways to ruin your favorite kitchen knife\n1. Scrape it sideways on a board\nKnives are made to cut in only two directions, back and forth and not side to side, so try not to use your good knives in a scraping manner. It may be instinct to move and gather all that chopped food on the board with the blade of the knife but it will damage the edge over time. If you can't break the habit completely, at least try and do it gently and without much downward force.\n2. Use it on anything other than wood or plastic\nThere are boards and blocks made from all sorts of materials but many of them are not knife-friendly. Stone or marble boards and glass surfaces should be reserved for serving food, not preparing it (at least not with a knife) since they will dull your blade faster than almost anything else.\nBamboo and plastic are the softest -- and often cheapest -- cutting board materials and will be gentle on your blades. Most other types of wood cutting boards, however, have enough give not to damage the blade.\n3. Store it freely in a drawer\nThis is probably the biggest mistake folks make with their kitchen knives. I've seen it more times than I can count and it hurts every time. Letting your knives clink around in a drawer with other knives and metal tools will dull or chip them over time. It's understandable to not want a clumsy knife block on the counter, but there are some pretty sleek options these days like this and this\nYou can also buy in-drawer wooden knife racks or sheath your knives in plastic cases. The coolest option may be to store the knives on one of these magnetic knife racks and show off your shiny blades to dinner guests. Just be gentle when placing knives on and removing them from the magnet so as not to scrape the blade.\n4. Let it soak in the sink or (*gasps*) put it in the dishwasher\nFor several reasons, your knives should never be put in the dishwasher. It'll likely damage the handles, and the blades should never be exposed to water for that long. Speaking of which, never let a knife sit wet in the sink or anywhere else, for that matter. That means no soaking, ever. When you've finished washing it by hand, dry it immediately, or the metal will become susceptible to rust and corrosion.\n5. Cut nonfood items or use it as a general tool\nGood knives may seem like a multipurpose tool but they should only be used for food prep. Try not to cut any nonfood items like plastic, cardboard or other packaging. And don't even think about employing your knife as a screwdriver or lever to pry open something stuck.\n6. Use a metal scrubber to clean it\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise that using metal or another rough material to clean your knife blade could lead to big problems. Instead, use hot water and a soft sponge or cloth. Your knives should never be so dirty that those aren't enough to get them clean.\n7. Oversharpen the blade\nThere comes a point at which a knife blade can't be sharpened anymore, and if you continue to pound it on a steel or whetstone, you'll only be shaving off the blade itself and shortening the knife's life span. Here's a guide to sharpening your kitchen knives."

      "text": "With the busy lifestyle most of us have, not everyone can prepare a meal from scratch every day. If you often have busy, tiring days but still prefer home-cooked meals, an Instant Pot is what you need. These electric pressure cookers cook faster and keep food warmer than the crock pot. We've tested the top models on the market to help you make the right choice for your kitchen.\nOur Picks\nRead more: 22 Great Gifts for $50 or Less\nBefore investing in an Instant Pot, consider how you'll use it -- specifically, your cooking style, culinary preferences and budget. Some models offer air frying and sous vide capabilities, while others include Wi-Fi connectivity. The latter enables smart features like the ability to control your Instant Pot via your mobile device or smart home integration like Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa. Most Instant Pot models come in three sizes -- 3, 6 and 8 quarts -- each with different features, programs and prices.\nIn terms of size, the 6-quart size is the most popular and ideal for families of three to five. Singles or couples might prefer the budget-friendly 3-quart, and if you cook for a large group on the regular, you might consider the larger 8-quart cooker.\nThese handy kitchen cookers look similar on the outside and will do the basic functions of pressure cooking, slow cooking, warming and saut\u00e9ing. If you're looking for an Instant Pot that performs specific food functions such as cooking eggs, making yogurt or even canning fruit, you'll need to know which models can do that. Different models prove better for different kinds of cooking, like precision programs, air frying, yogurt making and sous-vide cooking.\nWe're here to help you determine the best Instant Pot for your culinary needs. Here are our favorite Instant Pot models to help you find the perfect fit. And keep in mind that we update this list periodically -- so be sure to check back.\nBest Instant Pots and multicookers for 2025\nThe Instant Pot Duo is the company's most popular series and for good reason. It's super simple to operate and offers seven versatile cooking functions: pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, steamer, saut\u00e9, yogurt maker and warmer. You can buy the Duo in three sizes: 3-quart, 6-quart and 8-quart.\nIt's also the most affordable model with yogurt and poultry programs, as well as the option to pressure cook on high or low.\nPrograms included: Rice, Bean/Chili, Poultry, Meat/Stew, Multigrain, Porridge, Soup/Broth, Steam, Manual or Pressure Cooking\nWhat it doesn't have: Cake, Sterilize, Egg and Canning\nThe big draw for this Instant Pot is that it doubles as an air fryer -- and a good one at that. We've made several air-fried recipes in this versatile multicooker and the results rival even some of our favorite standalone air fryers. The Duo Crisp has most of the other functions you'd expect of an Instant Pot but a separate lid turns into a superconvection air fryer to save space in the kitchen. This one also has a pretty sturdy inner stainless steel cooking pot.\nThis model is available in a 6- or 8-quart capacity. You can also upgrade to the $230 Pro Crisp which offers the extra features of the Instant Pot with the air frying lid.\nPrograms included: Pressure Cook, Saut\u00e9, Slow Cook, Steam, Sous Vide, Warm, Air Fry, Roast, Bake, Broil, Dehydrate.\nDoesn't have: Canning, Sterilize, Poultry, Egg\nThe Instant Pot Pro is one of the more advanced models in the line, so it might not be the best choice for your first Instant Pot pressure cooker. It's still easy to operate with just a few more features like adjustable custom cooking programs and a precision temperature dial. The Pro also features a sous-vide cooking function -- low and slow water bath -- along with 28 other cooking programs.\nThis model has a stainless steel inner pot, a large LCD display, an upgraded steam-release valve, an auto-sealing lid, and easy-grip handles on the inner pot. The 6-quart Pro is $170 while the 8-quart version will cost you $190.\nPrograms included: Pressure cook, Slow, Sous vide, Saut\u00e9, Sterilize, Yogurt, Warmer, Cake and Steamer\nWhat it doesn't have: Air fry, Roast and Egg\nPros\n- The Instant Pot Smart WiFi sends mobile notifications when cooking is complete, and you can see the status of your food from anywhere through the Instant Pot app.\nCons\n- Adding Wi-Fi doesn't give you integration with any voice assistants or other smart home products. You can't actually change a cooking mode in the app once it's started cooking and there's no numerical temperature reading.\nYou may remember the first smart Instant Pot, the Instant Pot Smart, powered by Bluetooth. The company discontinued that model and replaced it with the $200 Instant Pot Pro Plus.\nThis tech-forward multicooker connects to your phone's Instant Pot control panel app for remote monitoring of your cooker, Instant Pot recipe customization and notifications. With the Pro Plus, you can select from one of more than 800 smart recipes and the app will wirelessly program the Instant Pot Pro Plus and direct you when to take certain steps.\nPrograms included: Rice, Bean/Chili, Meat/Stew, Multigrain, Porridge, Soup/Broth, Cake, Steam, Egg and Manual or Pressure Cooking\nWhat it doesn't have: Poultry and Sterilize\nThe Ultra series offers upgrades from the previous models. You can cook dishes like Instant Pot chicken breasts, mac and cheese or mashed potatoes with high and low pressure for up to 6 hours, which is 2 hours more than the Lux and Duo series. It's available in 3-quart, 6-quart and 8-quart sizes. It's the best Instant Pot for slow cooking.\nThe Ultra name comes from the added option to fine-tune parameters like temperature. Unlike with other Instant Pots, you can specify temperature to a single degree from 104 to 208 degrees Fahrenheit. You can also dial in specific values for cooking time, pressure level and delay time.\nPrograms included: Rice, Bean/Chili, Meat/Stew, Multigrain, Porridge, Soup/Broth, Cake, Sterilize, Steam, Egg, Manual or Pressure Cooking, and Ultra\nWhat it doesn't have: Poultry and Canning\nHow to choose the right Instant Pot\nBefore settling on an Instant Pot or multicooker, there are some considerations to make in terms of size, price, functionality and cooking programs.\nConsider the features and programs\nFood-specific modes and options will make the difference when it comes to picking the best Instant Pot for your cooking needs. If you want to venture into making your own yogurt, or if you love hard-boiled eggs, it's worth it to pay a bit more for an Instant Pot model that can do those things.\nPicking the right Instant Pot size\nWhen it comes to choosing the right size, Instant Pot recommends a 3-quart model for one or two people. Families of six or fewer will likely be happy with the 6-quart multicooker. If you have a large household or host large groups often, consider springing for an 8-quart model.\nPrice and value\nYou can find multicookers and Instant Pots for hundreds of dollars, but even the budget-friendly models do most of what you'll ask of an Instant Pot and do it well. The pricier models may include more cooking programs, more user-friendly release valves or a sleeker exterior, but how well they pressure-cook, slow-cook or steam won't change much even as you jump up in price.\nIf you're still not sure which model will be the best Instant Pot for your kitchen, take a look at Instant Pot's product comparison chart or its guide to choosing the right cooker. At the end of the day, all of these models offer the basic pressure-cooking and slow-cooking modes Instant Pot is known for performing so well.\nOther multicooker brands to consider\nThere are options from other brands, too. We reviewed a great Wi-Fi multicooker from ChefIQ, for example. It does more than Instant Pot's Wi-Fi model and comes with an integrated scale, nonstick pot and helpful iOS or Android app. It costs $200, so if you're not ready to graduate to a high-end model, Instant Pot's more affordable options are great for beginners. Ninja also makes several multicookers that have performed well in our testing. The Ninja Foodi 6.5-quart with SmartLid (out of stock) and is just one of several options from the brand's expansive line.\nInstant Pot FAQs\nHow do you clean an Instant Pot?\nIs an Instant Pot worth it?\nAre there any disadvantages to an Instant Pot?\nWhat size Instant Pot should you get?\nRead more: 9 Best Instant Pot Accessories"

      "text": "Grill season has arrived, but we've been testing and preparing our list of the best grills since long before the summer winds came blowin' in. With warm evenings, backyard hangs and burger cravings in full swing, now may be the time to upgrade your outdoor cooking setup. But choosing the right grill isn't as simple as grabbing the first one on sale.\nOur Picks\nHaving tested more than 35 grills, from speedy weeknight gas grills to low-and-slow pellet smokers, we've learned what really matters when shopping for a new backyard cooker. It comes down to four key factors: fuel type, cooking style, cooking capacity, and price.\nWhether you're after a pellet, charcoal, portable or gas grill, the perfect one is out there waiting for you, and we've zeroed in on the best in every category to fit your summer plans (and patio). Here's everything we've learned to help you find your perfect grill match.\nWhat's the best overall grill of 2025\nWe've crowned the reliable Weber E-310 three-burner propane grill as the best grill overall. It's a midsize, midpriced grill that impressed us with even cooking, simple assembly, a sturdy build and Weber's reputation for putting together long-lasting outdoor grills. The Spirit is available in two- and four-burner models, but we love the three-burner size for most households.\nGot more mouths to feed or need your grilling on the go? Don't worry -- we have picks for the best large grill, best camping grill and many more in our list of the best grills to buy in 2025, all tested by CNET.\nBest grills\nPros\n- Solid and sturdy build, yet easy to wheel around the deck\n- Quick ignition system worked without fail\n- Had even heat dispersion\n- Weber grills hold up, making this a solid value purchase\nCons\n- No extras included with grill\nWhy we like it:\nThere's a reason the Weber Spirit is one of the best-selling gas grills. The thoughtfully designed Weber has three burners and enough grill space (450 total square inches including top rack) to accommodate most grilling sessions. The E-310 holds about nine average-size burgers, so you may need to cook in batches when feeding larger groups.\nThe sturdy Spirit aced all our cooking tests, grilling ribs and chicken evenly and searing a crust on burgers quickly so we could maintain a juicy medium-rare inside. The Spirit's snap ignition worked better than other systems and lit the grill's three burners without fail. In our experience using Weber grills, the ignition systems also hold up over time, while other brands often give out.\nWho is it for:\nThis is our top pick for most people. The Weber Spirit cooks evenly and consistently and burns hot, allowing you to sear steaks, burgers, veggies and fish. Webers also tend to last better, making this grill an exceptional value when compared with others in the same price range.\nWho should avoid it:\nThe Spirit E-310 isn't teeming with extras, so folks seeking bells and whistles on their gas grill might consider another model on our list. It also has a medium-capacity grill top, so people feeding big crowds on the regular will benefit from a larger model.\nIf it's more space you seek, the four-burner Spirit is available for $180 more. The more modest two-burner version can be had for $399.\nPros\n- Huge cooking area with 860 square inches of space\n- Rotisserie adds a whole new dimension to grilling\n- The gas can weight helps you know when you need to refill.\nCons\n- A 4-hour construction time means you really need to love your grill\n- It costs more than $1,300\nWhy we like it:\nWe've been recommending Monument grills for years now and every time we test a new model, we discover upgrades that cement its status as a CNET pick. The latest, the Eminence 605, is a six-burner behemoth designed to grill food in any way you can imagine. It has modern conveniences, like an app to monitor the built-in temperature probes, and a searing station on the side that you can use to brown off corn and vegetables. It even comes with a gas can weigh scale that helps determine when your gas is low.\nWho is it for:\nThe Eminence 605 is a griller's grill. Its six-burner, 860 square-inch cooking area is perfect for larger families and those who cook for many people. The rotisserie spit has a dedicated back burner for a more even cook. I've used it for chicken, beef and even a large shish kebab and it perfectly cooked them all. Because of the high heat burners, the grill heats incredibly fast, taking just 7 minutes to reach 425 degrees so you can cook almost immediately. If you're looking to grill a diverse selection of foods for many people, then the Eminence 605 is perfect for you.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nBuilding the Eminence was a labor of love. It took two of us three hours to assemble it -- longest it's ever taken to build a grill. The box is filled with tiny pieces that need to be assembled, a lot of which feel like they could have been assembled earlier in the process. This is not a grill for the casual user or someone cooking for two or three.\nPros\n- Excellent build quality for a budget grill\n- 582 square inches of cook space is big enough for a large family\n- The built-in hooks, bottle opener and easy to clean spaces make it a great choice\nCons\n- The ash tray is thin and will warp over time if not well maintained\nWhy we like it:\nWhen our tester James Bricknell moved out to California\u2019s High Desert, he had two priorities: a grill big enough to feed a crowd and a price tag that wouldn\u2019t break the bank after an expensive move. He landed on a budget-friendly model that impressed right out of the box \u2014 sturdy materials, solid build and the kind of weight that promised durability. And it delivered.\nThe removable ashtray made cleanup painless, and the built-in thermometer was a game changer for low-and-slow smoking without constantly lifting the lid. Bonus points for thoughtful extras like a built-in bottle opener and utensil hooks under the side shelf.\nWho is it for:\nIf you want the taste that only charcoal can give you but have a limited budget, the Expert grill is excellent. The large cooking area means you can cook a big family meal with no issue, and I really like the little touches like the adjustable cooking rack. As the coals burn down, they radiate less heat. Being able to move the grates down to be closer to the coals lets you use them for longer and gives you greater control of your cooking times.\nWho shouldn't get it:\nCharcoal grills are not for everybody. Several states don't allow charcoal for fear of forest fires and it takes longer to get a charcoal grill going. If you want an instant grilling hit then gas is the way to go. You'll also need to clean a charcoal grill more often than a gas one as the coal dust can corrode the metal over time.\nPros\n- A tight lid seal makes the smoking experience much more efficient\n- The light on the lid and pellet hopper make evening cooking much easier\n- The mobile app and WiFire feature lets you keep an eye on your meat without lifting the lid.\nCons\n- Traeger grills are expensive. There's just no getting around it.\nWhy we like it:\nSeeing Traeger at the top of this list shouldn't be surprising, considering the brand truly popularized the pellet grill. While there are many choices in the Traeger lineup to choose from, after testing the latest Ironwood XL, it was clear that this is the one that can do it all. There is a smaller version, the Traeger Ironwood, which has all the same features as the XL model but more than 300 square inches less cooking space. If you don't plan on cooking large pieces of meat like brisket or for large groups of people, then the smaller model might be for you. The WiFIRE features allow you to monitor grill temps, pellet levels, food temps with the included meat probes and more. The control system combining a rotating knob and touchscreen makes tuning the grill to your needs a snap. We also like the Traeger app, which has many recipes to send straight to your grill. The biggest downside is the price, which is quite expensive.\nWho is it for:\nThe Traeger Ironwood XL gets the top spot for smokers because of more than just the large cooking area. It's because it offers the complete package for pellet grills. It does a great job of managing its pellet use. When we cooked for 24 hours on it, with meals ranging from pork chops to beer can chicken to pork butt to brisket, the Ironwood XL handled it all wonderfully. With a 165- to 500-degree temperature range, it can cook any way you want. If you're looking for something versatile that can cook burgers, veggies and entire smoked briskets, then the Ironwood is an excellent choice. There is little this grill can't do when cooking outdoors.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nThere is no getting around it: any Traeger grill is expensive. They are built to last, and you can see the craftsmanship that went into the design but they aren't for those on a slim budget. Only think about picking this up if you have the thousands of dollars needed to make the purchase.\nPros\n- A built-in smoker gives ribs, chicken and brisket an authentic barbecue flavor\n- Convection fan disperses heat evenly throughout the chamber\n- Griddle attachment let us cook fish and veggies on one side without losing them through the grates\n- Plenty of space to grill on the 545 square inches of cooking surface\nCons\n- Expensive and most attachments are extra\n- Must be plugged in to operate\nWhy we like it:\nNinja's first full-size grill, the FlexFlame, is unlike any other gas grill we've tested. The large propane-powered unit has a built-in smoker box that can be turned on with the push of a button and that saturated the food inside with applewood or hickory flavor. The FlexFlame has loads of attachments, mostly sold separately, that turn it into a flat-top griddle or a pizza oven. The Ninja exhibited exceptional temperature control, all the way up to a scorching 600 degrees Fahrenheit, and lightning-fast heat recovery when the lid was closed after flipping burgers or checking chicken.\nWe loved making seared steaks over the grates on one side and using the half-griddle attachment to cook flaky fish and veggies on the other. The FlexFlame offers more versatility than most grills and is easy to operate.\nRead our full review of the Ninja FlexFlame here.\nWho is it for:\nThis is a big, feature-heavy grill that makes it a joy to entertain large groups. The main grill surface offers 424 square inches of cooking capacity (enough for about 15 burgers), and a stop rack supplements that with another 121 square inches. You can cook using multiple modes and methods at once, including flat-top griddling, smoking, and using a dedicated pizza stone for slinging pies. The grill's exceptional heat control, thanks to a convection fan and carefully calibrated dials, make it a pleasure to roast chicken or slow-cook a brisket. Heat is dispersed so evenly throughout the chamber, you could actually use it for baking. The built-in smoker box lets wannabe pitmasters impart authentic barbecue flavor.\nWho should avoid it:\nThe FlexFlame has a bunch of features that contribute to the higher cost. If you don't think you'll use the smoker function or griddle attachment, it might not be worth the expense. This grill also requires electricity to run, which can be cumbersome depending on your outdoor configuration.\nPros\n- The largest cooking area & pellet hopper you've ever seen\n- Mobile app to control heat and monitor cooking\nCons\n- We wish it had a seal around the lid like the Traeger does\nWhy we like it:\nThe Recteq brand may be a bit under the radar compared to others like Traeger, but the Flagship XL 1400 does some things the Ironwood XL cannot. With a massive 1,437 square-inch cooking surface, you can cook a whole lot of food. Like, 75 hamburgers at one time. Enough to feed the entire block.\nWith built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, using the Recteq app makes it easy to monitor the grill temp and meat temps with the included probes. You can't check the pellet level from the app like with the Ironwood XL.\nBecause the Recteq Flagship XL 1400 is built like a tank, including the heavy bullhorn handles, it does an excellent job at maintaining an even temp across the grill. This is largely thanks to the heavy cast iron burn pot deflector and the large stainless steel smoke and heat deflector.\nWho is it for:\nThe Flagship XL is for people who are serious about cooking for everybody. People with massive families or small businesses could use the XL to smoke and grill for dozens of people easily. To complement the large cooking area, the Flagship XL 1400 also boasts a massive pellet hopper, easily handling more than 40 pounds of wood pellets. It also did a good job of cooking efficiently during the overnight brisket smoking during testing. So if you are looking for long, slow cooks this could be for you.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nAlmost everyone who grills or smokes casually should avoid the Flagship XL. It's just too big for the average person to use comfortably and if you're only smoking a rack of ribs or enough wings for four getting it up to temperature will use too much fuel for it to be worthwhile.\nPros\n- Perfect size for two to four people to smoke a single meal\n- Uses just 1 cup of pellets per meal\n- Multiple functions like air frying and grilling make it a versatile smoker\nCons\n- The side pellet holder can become clogged if you don't maintain it well.\nWhy we like it:\nThe Ninja Woodfire has all the convenience of an indoor electric grill and air fryer, with the addition of a small smoking hopper that lets you burn pellets. These pellets add a distinctive smoky taste to anything you are cooking without the need for an entire smoker. We've cooked chicken, salmon and beef on the grill setting using just a cup of pellets, saving much time and money compared with a full-size smoker. It even works with the air fryer so it is easy to make crispy wings with an Applewood smoke taste.\nWho is it for:\nThe Woodfire is perfect for those who love the taste of smoked meat but don't have the time or space for a giant pellet smoker. It's big enough to cook a decent-sized turkey or several large cuts of meat, and the pellet used is tiny compared to a full-size smoker. If you want a quick smoke fix for a few friends, the Ninja Woodfire is perfect.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nAnyone looking to smoke large cuts of meat like brisket or pork shoulder over a long period of time should look for something larger than the Woodfire. It's designed for single meals, not large parties or giant cuts of meat. The pellet hopper only holds one cup of pellets. That's not enough to smoke a haunch of beef.\nPros\n- You can cook flaky fish and thin vegetables without losing them through the grates\n- Griddles require less cleaning after use\n- Great for making classic diner breakfast food\nCons\n- Food doesn't get char marks or flame-kissed\n- It's expensive at $900\n- Griddles require maintenance to keep the surface from rusting\nWhy we like it:\nLike all Traeger products, Flatrock's quality and usefulness can't be overstated. Some foods, including tacos and smash burgers, just can't be cooked on a standard grill, but a flat-top griddle makes them a breeze. (By the way, if you've never had a smash burger, you need one in your life. They're amazing.) We recommend the Flatrock, even though it's pricier than a Blackstone, because of the build quality and the placement of the griddle top. The top is sunk into the grill, meaning the heat stays in for longer, and the seal around the lid keeps it from getting as rusty in the off-season.\nThe Flatrock uses Traeger's Pop and Lock system for accessories, so if you already have one of the brand's smokers, you can mix and match what you need. You will need to cure the Flatrock's surface, but we enjoyed creating just the right surface for our needs.\nWho is it for:\nGriddles are a grill genre that's pretty unique. The Flatrock is great for anyone who loves making tacos, breakfast burritos, Japanese teppanyaki or smash burgers. The heavy grill top requires some maintenance to keep it looking good but the flavor from a properly cured griddle top is hard to beat.\nWho shouldn't get it:\nIf this is your first foray into cooking on a griddle, the Traeger may be too expensive to start. Its price is the biggest barrier to entry, so you could always start with one of the smaller Blackstones to see how you like it. Griddles also require regular maintenance to keep the surface from rusting.\nPros\n- Easy to carry out to a campsite or for tailgating\n- Even heat across the cooking surface, even out in the bush\n- Includes a spirit level to keep your oil from spilling while on an uneven surface\nCons\n- This really should have a cover as standard if you're expected to travel with it.\nWhy we like it:\nHalo has made some excellent products in the past few years, including a pizza oven that we tested and liked, but this griddle is a stand-out product. On top of all the standard testing we do with grills, CNET's James Bricknell got to take it for the first camping trip of the season and it was a smashing success. The cooking surface heated evenly, with two distinct burning zones and because of the inspired idea to include a spirit level and adjustable feet, he could set it up on a rickety picnic table and not have eggs run to one corner. That spirit level is such a good idea.\nWe love having a giant griddle to cook for large groups at home but the Halo tabletop griddle is perfect for making a few smash burgers or breakfast burritos without using a ton of gas. In fact, the Halo can use the large propane tanks or the smaller green ones just as easily.\nWho is it for:\nAnyone who wants to take their grilling on the road would do well with the Halo griddle. Camping is an obvious use but you could easily take it to a friend's house to help supplement the grill capacity or for tailgating at a cookout. It's heavy -- it's a thick grill pan, after all -- but not so heavy that you couldn't get it to just about any campsite.\nWho shouldn't get it:\nThe Halo is really designed to be moved around and used in a portable environment. If you aren't planning to move it around, there are better choices. That said, it's good for getting out from the shed for the occasional grilling session.\nPros\n- Premium look and feel, which it should have for the price\n- Remote monitoring with the app gives you peace of mind even when smoking\n- Can produce very high heat, making cooking a variety of meats a breeze.\n- Maintains consistent temperature for 12+ hours on one load of charcoal\nCons\n- That price tag is as high as the temperature\n- Heavy at 250 lbs - difficult to move\nWhy we Like it:\nKamado grilling cookers are distinctively egg-shaped wood-burning grills. They impart a delicious smoky flavor to everything and this is the best grill in the bunch. They can run low and slow for hours at smoker temperatures and sear at high heat levels that go well beyond the capabilities of gas grills. That's hot enough to create true steakhouse steaks and real wood-fired pizza like a pro griller.\nThese abilities are attributed to the thick ceramic used to form and line the grill, which is similar to what is used for a pizza stone in the top pizza ovens. That ceramic does an amazing job at holding heat, allowing you to use far less charcoal than you would in a traditional charcoal grill and get more smoke and heat from it. On our slow-and-low barbecue grill test, we adjusted grills to 225 degrees Fahrenheit (107 degrees Celsius) and let go of the controls to see what happens. In this trial, the Konnected Joe demonstrated excellent temperature stability. Thanks to the Wi-Fi connectivity, you can monitor and set temps for your ceramic cooker from the comfort of your AC.\nWho is it for:\nKamado grills are niche and designed for the griller's griller. Their smaller size makes them difficult to use for big parties but the charcoal flavor that you get from the high-heat environment is hard to beat. If you're a grill aficionado, then the Konnected Joe might be right for you.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nKamado grills are something a niche grill. They deliver results and have a passionate fanbase but you'll need to learn a new way to cook if you want to use them right. This isn't going to be for the family griller who just wants to cook some burgers and hot dogs. There are better grills for that.\nRecent updates\nMay 2025: We replaced the former best overall pick, Monument's Denali 605 and recategorized it as the best large gas grill. We also added the Halo Griddle as the best for camping.\nJune 2025: We tested the Weber Spirit E-310 and added it as the best grill overall. We also tested the Ninja FlexFlame Grill with smoker box and added it as the best gas grill features.\nBest grills comparison chart\n| Weber Spirit E-310 | Monument Eminence 605 | Ninja FlexFlame | Traeger Ironwood XL | Recteq Flagship XL 1400 | Ninja Woodfire electric grill | Traeger Flatrock | Halo Griddle | Kamado Joe Konnected Joe | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Fuel type | Propane | Propane | Propane, electricity | Pellet | Pellet | Electric | Propane | Propane | Charcoal |\n| Cooking size (Square inches) | 450 | 860 | 545 | 924 | 1437 | 141 | 594 | 284 | 250 |\n| Side shelves | 3 | 1 shelf, 1 side burner | 2 | 1 drop-down shelf, board on hopper | 1 shelf | 0 | 2 shelves | 0 | 2 shelves |\n| Number of burners | 3 | 6 | 3 | 1 auger and pellet fire | 1 pellet furnace | 1 electric burners, 1 pellet burner | 3-zone burners | 2 | N/A |\n| Enclosed base | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Price | $$ | $$$ | $$$ | $$$$$ | $$$$ | $$ | $$$ | $$ | $$$$$ |\nHow we test grills at CNET\nWe test the main types of grills differently, but for most, we include a high-heat test like searing steak or grilling burgers, a medium, indirect heat test like grilling a whole chicken for more than an hour and a low-and-slow test with racks of ribs. With over 30 grills tested, we've got this down to a tee. To determine what should be the best outdoor barbecue grill, we collect data including total cooking time, temperatures inside the grill and temperatures inside separate pieces of meat. All that information helps us find where grills might have hot spots or thermometer inconsistencies.\n- High heat test: Cooking 5.3-ounce burger patties until they reach 145 degree internal temperature.\n- Indirect heat test: Cooking a 5.5-pound chicken off the flames to 160 degrees.\n- Low and Slow: Cooking a rack of pork ribs at 225 for 3 hours and taste testing.\nTemperature consistency\nWe use the InfiRay P2 Pro to test how fast the grills heat up and if the heat is even. It only works as the grills heat up because the top temperature is too high, but it gives us a good idea of how well each grill spreads the needed heat. The InfiRay P@ allows us to take temperature readings at multiple points across the heating area for a better average result. We also use it to see if there is any major heat loss from other areas on the grill that may show poor quality builds.\nWe also use a stopwatch to determine how quickly the temperature drops over a one-minute interval when opening the lid. It's an especially helpful test for smokers, where you may need to check the meat but don't want to compromise the cooking time. We always suggest using a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of any food you are smoking, rather than opening the lid as they almost all lose around 100 degrees per minute.\nTaste testing\nThere's also a fair amount of (read: so much) taste testing, lively debate, and voting among our editors and families, in addition to the data we gather about grilling temperatures and cooking times. You might think it would be more fun than work to eat delicious food while discussing the merits of a grill, and you'd be right.\nWe don't just taste test the three specific products in our temperature tests, as that wouldn't give us a good spread. We choose products that people love to grill, including vegetables like corn, asparagus, and mushrooms, and meats like chicken legs, wings and steaks. When we can, we cook on multiple grills at once and keep a note on which products come from where. Then ask our (lucky) testers which they like the most. This is the least objective of the tests, but it is helpful in a real-world way. If the food just doesn't taste good, then that grill likely isn't doing a good job.\nIf you're interested in any particular method of testing, we have a dedicated how we test page, plus our recommendations for cooking with kamado grills, portable grills and charcoal grills ready for your perusal. Happy grilling.\nFactors to consider when choosing the best grill\nWhile the perfect grill may not exist for everyone, many grills tick a lot of boxes. The right grill for you depends on what type of food you want to grill, so bear that in mind. Here is some guidance:\nType of grill\n- Charcoal grill: Good for high heat and getting that perfect char.\n- Gas grill: Great for large grills and spur-of-the-moment outdoor cooking.\n- Flat top grills (griddles): Perfect for smash burgers and tacos.\n- Pellet grill: Perfect for long, slow cooking and smoking your food.\n- Kamado grill: Great for extreme heat or heat retention.\n- Pizza oven: Wonderful for pizza, sure, but great for other breads, too.\nBudget range\nYour budget can often determine what kind of grill you have. If your budget is low or you are just starting out in the grilling game, then a charcoal grill is likely the cheapest way to start. The fuel is cheap, too, and easy to get just about anywhere. If you are looking for something you can use all year round, or is a little more versatile, then a gas grill is the way to go. Propane is fairly cheap and lasts longer than a bag of coal. It's cheaper in the long run. Smokers can also be found for cheap, though the best ones can skyrocket in price. Always start with a more affordable version before jumping into something pricey. After all, it might not be the right type of grilling for you.\nAdditional features\nHaving extra features is always great. For grills, that means extras that make it easier to cook the food or make the food taste better. We like to have an enclosed lower area, for example, not because it makes the food taste good, but because it's easier to store all the equipment needed to grill. Having a grill with a built-in Bluetooth connection and app can also make grilling easier and make the food taste better, so it's a double whammy. Making everything smart isn't always helpful, but having a way to monitor your cooking is.\nOne of the reasons the Eminence 605 from Monument is high on our list is because of the extras it offers at no additional cost. The side searing plate, the rotisserie and smart temperature probes make it a grilling machine for those who love this cooking style.\nNo matter what type of outdoor grill you choose, you should brush up on how to clean it (keeping that grilling surface clean with a grill brush and grill cleaner is essential) and get the best accessories for grilling. Having the right techniques and tools of the trade will complement your perfect grill, turn you into a grill master extraordinaire and make your cookouts a breeze.\nOther grills we tested\n- Monument Denali 605: This was a former best overall pick, but we recently replaced it with Monument's newer model, the Eminence 605.\n- Char-Broil Signature Series four-burner: We tested this well-built and practical Char-Broil model in 2019. It was middle of the road in our testing and the new model is available for around $550. It comes with plenty of cooking space, a side burner and cabinet doors. If you're a fan of Char-Broil's grills, this model is a safe bet, but there are better grills from other brands for your money.\n- Napoleon Rogue three-burner: Despite its cool looks and sturdy construction, this Napoleon model was underwhelming in our tests. At $749, it's pricey and the Char-Broil three-burner we tested delivered better results.\n- Dyna-glo five-burner: This reasonably priced five-burner has plenty of power, with 63,000 BTU -- plus a sixth \"turbo\" burner that offers an additional 12,000 BTU. We like its porcelain cast-iron grate cooking surface for searing. Still, we found the cooking to be uneven.\n- Char-Broil Commercial three-burner:This grill with smart features was a previous pick on our list but it's been usurped as best under $500 model by the Weber Spirit E-310.\n- KitchenAid 720-0891C (Update: Out of Stock): KitchenAid's style and color options are impressive, but the performance of this $299, two-burner gas grill was underwhelming in all three tests. If you're looking for a two-burner grill, the Weber Spirit II E-210 is a better choice. It's a Propane gas grill but can also be converted to natural gas. This model is also pretty tough to find in stock since it was recently discontinued.\n- Magma Firebox Single-Burner: This is another grill we liked but it's not portable, as advertised, nor affordable. The burner alone weighs 26 pounds and originally cost $200 (although it's currently on a steep clearance), but you'll need to add the grill top accessory, which costs $350. This model was engineered with boaters in mind, so if you're setting sail, you might give the pricey Magma a closer look\n- Giantex Tabletop Propane Grill: We had no major issues with this grill. It worked fine, got hot and cooked evenly. When compared to the Weber Q, we simply like the design of those small gas grills better. The Weber Q is more solid and has those handy built-in shelves while the NomadiQ is simply the most portable gas grill we've ever seen. This is a fine grill and worthy of the $300 list price.\n- Char-Broil Deluxe Tabletop Grill: While the above Char-Broil might work as a no-nonsense budget grill, this model is way too poorly designed and crafted to waste $70. It is one of the worst for value in the small grill category and a definite one to avoid.\n- Char-Broil Portable Gas Grill: This grill is cheap, and the product matches the price tag. It was rickety once assembled and didn't feel like it would last more than a season. For $50, what more could you hope for? If you need something to get you through a camping weekend or two, this should do the trick.\nGrill FAQs\nShould I get a natural gas or propane gas grill?\nIt may seem like this is a simple question to answer, but they aren't really the same thing. Some propane gas grills can be converted to run off of natural gas from your home gas line, but you lose the portability of a propane tank.\nNatural gas grills are normally installed in an outdoor kitchen where the gas line can be run permanently. If you don't have the room to build a permanent fixture, then sticking with propane is your best option.\nHow do different grill types compare in terms of weather resistance?\nFirstly, you should always buy your grill a cover. A good cover will keep your grill protected from too much sun and too much rain, so invest in one as soon as you can.\nBuild quality will affect weather resistance more than fuel type, but fuel does make a difference. Charcoal and pellet grills produce ash, which, when mixed with rainwater, can become extremely corrosive. A good maintenance schedule will keep a lot of corrosion at bay, but if you do live in a wet environment, then a gas grill may be a better option. The stainless steel construction is less likely to corrode over time and there is almost no ash to increase that corrosion."

      "text": "I've long been fascinated by the idea of homemade yogurt, even if instinct would have you believe that an advanced knowledge of dairy science would be required for such a project. \"Live and active cultures\" -- the hallmark of yogurt's tang and the key to its gut healthfulness -- would seem to necessitate at least a petri dish, right? That's not so much the case. Yogurt is essentially the dairy version of sourdough bread, where a basic starter in the form of already-made yogurt can beget even more yogurt.\nRead more: 12 Best Probiotic Foods to Eat for Gut Health\nWhat's more, you don't even need special equipment for this. If you're serious, you can buy a yogurt maker, and some bread machines may even have a yogurt setting, (again, yogurt = sourdough) but you don't need anything more than your basic slow cooker to accomplish this. Conventional yogurt and milk are the only necessary ingredients, and besides the slow cooker itself, a food thermometer will be required to achieve certain key temperatures, but that's it. Here's a breakdown of everything you may need to know to start your yogurt laboratory at home.\nHow do you make yogurt in the slow cooker?\nThe steps of homemade yogurt are simple but time-consuming, so either be prepared to begin your yogurt experiment first thing in the morning, or begin in the early evening to finish the yogurt overnight.\nWhat you need to make slow cooker yogurt:\n- Slow cooker (I used this $40 Crock-Pot model)\n- Probe thermometer\n- \u00bd cup plain yogurt with live and active cultures\n- A half gallon of milk: you can customize it to your liking, but I used organic, 2%, pasture-raised\nBegin by pouring the milk into the slow cooker and heating it on high until the milk reaches 180 degrees F. I poked around for the reason behind this step, and the short answer is that this is the magic number to alter the protein structure of the milk for optimum yogurt viscosity. (No further dairy science is required, I promise.) This step took just over 2 hours in my slow cooker.\nAfter the milk reaches 180 degrees, turn the slow cooker off, and allow the milk to cool to just below 120 degrees. This also took about 2 hours. The optimum temperature for the live and active cultures to do their thing is between 110 and 120 degrees F.\nCarefully stir in \u00bd cup of yogurt into the warm milk. Note: You do not turn the slow cooker back on at this point, or ever again. The ambient warmth from the original heating of the milk is all that is required for the transformation to take place, where the already-made yogurt infuses the milk with the necessary cultures.\nReplace the lid on the slow cooker, and cover it with a towel to keep the environment dark. (Apparently, live and active cultures do like to keep a bit of mystery about themselves, so you can't watch them do their thing. Rightly so.) Then wait 8 to 12 hours for the mixture to ferment and thicken. You can place the slow cooker in the refrigerator after 6 hours, which I did since I got started later than I now know I should have, and it was time to go to bed.\nHow did the slow cooker yogurt turn out?\nSo, how did it all work out? Honestly? Better than I expected. The yogurt was creamy, tangy, and slightly more fluid than you might expect from the grocery store, but to me, this more closely resembles European-style yogurt, which I happen to like. If you want Greek-style yogurt, it will require an additional step involving cheesecloth and another 8 hours or so, and you'll get a smaller yield.\nThe fluid type of yogurt this does make is well worth your time: it's perfect for drizzling over granola or fruit salad, using as the basis for a creamy salad dressing and dip or freezing into portions to use for smoothies. If you happen to have an ice cream maker, this yogurt is already the perfect consistency for churning up some frozen yogurt.\nThe half gallon of milk made basically a half gallon, or two quarts, of yogurt, so freezing some may be necessary depending on your yogurt consumption pace. There's a slight bit of whey to drain off from the top of the batch, but this is exactly like the watery substance that appears on top of your grocery store yogurt as well, and it amounted to less than I was expecting.\nAre there any drawbacks to making yogurt in the slow cooker?\nBecause of the heating and cooling steps involved with the milk, it's not like making dinner in the slow cooker where you can just set it and forget it. I was admittedly impatient for those steps to take place, which took longer than I anticipated, but now that I have a first-hand understanding of the timing involved, I'll be able to not have to watch those steps so closely or wonder how long they'll take.\nI had specifically wanted to make yogurt in the slow cooker since that's a popular device even the occasional home cook is likely to have. Since my bread machine has a yogurt setting that promises finished yogurt in 8 hours by automating the required temperatures, I'll probably give that a try next time.\nCan you save money by making yogurt in the slow cooker?\nIn short, yes. The half gallon of organic milk I bought at about $6 is about what I'd expect to pay for a quart of good quality, plain yogurt. Since the recipe amounts to about two quarts of yogurt, you get twice as much for the same price, rendering it half the cost to do it yourself. Plus, you can use your homemade yogurt as the starter culture for your next batch of homemade yogurt, so you save yourself those $2 or so on subsequent batches as well.\nDepending on your yogurt consumption, this may or may not amount to significant savings in a year, but savings are savings, and homemade yogurt is cool."

      "text": "If you\u2019re aiming to eat healthier without giving up on flavor or convenience, an air fryer is the perfect companion. They use less oil to achieve the same crispy and caramelized texture you get from pan-frying, roasting, and broiling. To help you find the best, I've tested models from Ninja, De\u2019Longhi, Breville, Phillips, Cosori and Dash.\nOur Picks\nFrom cooking whole chickens to crisping up chickpeas, vegetables or salmon, air fryers handle it all with ease. I make no secret of my love for air fryers, and I've been testing various models for more than five years. My list of favorite things to make in the air fryer grows by the week, but choosing the right countertop oven to make them isn't as simple as it seems.\nWhat's the best air fryer overall?\nWhen Ninja released its Ninja glass-bowl Crispi, we got a new favorite air fryer on our list after two years. The Crispi has loads of power and is easy to clean, plus the cooking chamber doubles as a portable food container. This is hands down the best air fryer to buy in 2025. And guess what? It's available for just $180 -- a bargain.\nThe dynamic glass Crispi is the air fryer we now recommend most, but there are several other picks to choose from that cost less, hold more food or feature additional cooking modes and methods not available on that model.\nRead more: The Air Fryer Is the Best and Fastest Way to Make a Roast Chicken\nBest air fryers of 2025\nPros\n- Glass cooking chamber is easy to clean\n- Can view your food's progress without stopping\n- Cooking chamber turns into a sealed food container\n- Simple controls\nCons\n- Glass gets hot during and after cooking\n- Pricier than others on the list\n- No precise control of temperature\nWhat I liked:\nOur new favorite air fryer comes from the makers of our old favorite. The glass bowl Ninja offers several advantages over metal and nonstick cooking baskets. First, you can see your food while it's being cooked. After cooking, the glass bottom chamber converts to a sealable food carrier when you pop on a rubber lid. As a bonus, the Ninja Crispi's glass cooking chamber was the easiest to get squeaky clean of all the air fryers we've tested.\nUnlike most air fryers that utilize a basket that slides in and out of the machine, this air fryer has a cooking mechanism that clamps down on one of the included 4-quart or 6-cup containers. The powerful coils cooked everything we put inside to a perfect, even crisp. Four simple cooking modes -- warm, reheat, bake, and air fry -- and the adjustable timer made using the machine a breeze.\nWho is it for:\nIt's the best air fryer for those who are particular about getting their kitchen tools squeaky clean. It's also the best air fryer for anyone concerned about nonstick coatings and the potential hazards they present.\nWho should avoid it:\nThe one downside, aside from the high price, is that the glass chamber gets and stays pretty hot both during and after cooking, which could present a danger to careless cooks or those with small children. The glass bowls are equipped with stay-cool handles for handling and transporting the air fryer.\nPros\n- Modest size is good for crowded kitchens\n- Air fryer function was great\n- Able to do gentle toasting in addition to powerful air-frying\n- Fun retro look and available in a range of colors\n- Steam function helps keep food moist\nCons\n- There are definitely cheaper options available\n- Air fryer toaster ovens aren't as easy to clean\nWhat I liked:\nA conveniently sized, PFAS-free, countertop-worthy appliance that can air fry, bake, roast, toast, reheat and broil -- all with steam infusion technology for crispy exteriors and soft, moist interiors. It does everything, from ultra-crispy air frying to serious roasting, to rejuvenating steam infusion. It\u2019s fairly spacious, although certainly not the largest oven we tried. You could roast a roughly 4-pound chicken or go multilevel to cook double the capacity of a stand-alone air fryer.\nThis oven allows you to\nWho is it for:\nIf you have trouble keeping your air-fryer food from drying out, the Wonder Oven is the only model on our list with a steam function that helps keep food moist while it's being blasted with superconvection heat.\nWho should avoid it:\nThe modest capacity means you may have to cook food in batches. If you regularly feed a large crowd, consider upgrading to a larger air fryer or air-frying toaster oven.\nPros\n- Has major power and cooked food faster than any other air fryer we tested\n- The build is sturdy\n- Controls are simple\n- At $69, it's an excellent value\nCons\n- Its shiny plastic body shows fingerprints easily\nWhat I liked:\nNinja's sleek and efficient pod air fryer impressed us in several rounds of testing. At $69, it's a clear pick for the best budget air fryer in 2025. The Ninja is powerful, easy to operate, looks great and is reasonably priced. We tested both the 4-quart model and the otherwise identical 5.5-quart model (perfect for roasting a whole chicken). There were no discernible differences in performance between the two.\nThe Ninja turned out the best chicken wings of any air fryer we cooked them in. It seems to run a little hotter than other models of its size, but I consider that a good thing. Air frying is about getting the outside crispy without drying out the middle, and you need a blast of hot convection to do it.\nWho is it for:\nThose seeking a budget-friendly basket-style air fryer with lots of power. The Ninja's control panel is simple and intuitive. Beyond flicking on the air fryer, there are a handful of presets and cooking modes, including bake and reheat, that are perfect for warming bread or reviving leftover pizza without burning it.\nWho should avoid it:\nThis air fryer sports a nonstick basket, so if you're worried about chemical leaching or the coating wearing out over time, choose Ninja's glass-bowl air fryer instead. One other thing to note is that the Ninja lacks a special cooking mode for vegetables. Much as in earlier rounds of testing, the fresh Brussels sprouts emerged a tad overdone -- even burnt in spots. This simply requires a little more checking when you're air-frying certain foods for the first time.\nPros\n- Air fryer and pressure cooker both work great\n- Great value considering how much it does\nCons\n- Difficult to clean after air frying\n- Heavier than solo air fryers\nWhat I like:\nThis Instant Pot model is a pressure cooker, slow cooker, and air fryer with sear and steam functions, to boot. I found the air fryer function worked as well or better than most of the solo air fryers I tested.\nInstant Pot's Duo model made incredible crispy \"fried\" chicken, wings, veggies, and other classics, but know that you'll likely have to cook in batches if you're making food for a group. It's also a solid deal considering all this machine does. The Duo Crisp can often be found for $150 or cheaper if you nab it on sale.\nWho is it for:\nIf you're eyeing an air fryer but also an Instant Pot or another multicooker, let me save you some money and kitchen space. The Instant Pot Duo does all the work of the popular multicooker -- pressure cooker, slow cooker, steam and saute -- but comes with a separate air fryer lid and cooking function as well.\nWho should avoid it:\nIt's worth noting that the air fryer cooking capacity is relatively small, even if the full chamber for pressure and slow cooking is large. Another thing I didn't love about this model is the steel air fryer basket, which is trickier to clean than the pod-shaped models, most of which feature nonstick cooking baskets.\nPros\n- Sleek design and consistent function\n- Close to a replacement for your wall oven\n- Preheats fast\n- Great for holidays or when extra cooking capacity is needed\nCons\n- Expensive\n- A large cooking chamber makes it harder to get that true air fryer crust.\n- The air fryer function isn't as powerful as some others we tried\nWhat I like:\nBreville's stylish Smart Oven Air is our favorite air fryer and toaster combo. This isn't just a proficient air fryer but a mini version of a smart oven that can handle a small chicken, as many as four filets of salmon or a tray of homemade cookies. Most likely because of its size, the Smart Oven Air took a little bit longer to get crispy chicken wings and Brussels sprouts, but only by a few minutes.\nWho is it for:\nIf you want a countertop appliance that can do far more than wings and wedges, this is a whole lot of oven capability. The Breville heats very consistently and has a wealth of cooking modes -- toast, bagel, bake, roast, broil, warm, reheat, air fry -- making it about as good a replacement for your big oven as any. This makes a great supplement to your large oven during holidays and other occasions where extra cooking capacity is welcomed.\nWho should avoid it:\nIf you like a toaster oven and are just looking for an air fryer, this probably isn't the pick.\nPros\n- Light and easy to move around the kitchen\n- Good power despite a compact 2-quart size\n- Comes in 5 colors\n- Has a fun retro look\nCons\n- Small 2-quart capacity is not ideal for large groups or families\nWhat I like:\nAs the award suggests, this air fryer is small. About as small as any brand makes them. If you're only cooking for one or two people, it may be enough capacity and will save you precious space on the counter. The Dash has enough power to make eight or nine crispy chicken wings in about 20 minutes and a few servings of fries in about half that time.\nThe single analog dial is easy to manipulate, and there is just one mode -- air fry -- to keep things uncomplicated. For an air fryer under $50, this model is fairly solid, and the basket fits snugly into the hull without any wobble. It's also easy to clean and quiet when running.\nWho is it for:\nIf you're after pure value, the Dash performs well and will cost less than $50. It's also perfect for smaller kitchens or those wanting to test out an air fryer without committing much money or kitchen space.\nWho should avoid it:\nIf you're cooking for more than two or three people, this air fryer won't be big enough.\nPros\n- Dual basket design allows you to cook multiple foods at once\n- Huge capacity for making big batches of food for crowds\nCons\n- Takes up a lot of space in the kitchen\n- Expensive for an air fryer\nWhat I like:\nA dual-basket air fryer allows you to cook most of an entire meal in one go without fear of burning one thing or undercooking the other. Smaller baskets net better results when air frying, so I suggest a dual-basket as opposed to an oven with one single, large cooking chamber. This model has all the same settings and cooking modes as Ninja's single-basket model, but allows you to toggle between both baskets to set the time and temp accordingly. There's also a handy match-cook setting if you're doing one huge heap of wings in both baskets.\nWhile Instant also makes a formidable version, Ninja's 8-quart (two 4-quart baskets) is our top pick. It sports tons of power at a great price. As with the single-basket Ninja, this machine feels rock solid, and the baskets slide in firmly with no wiggle.\nWho is it for:\nThis is the perfect air fryer for those who regularly cook for big groups. You can make double batches of wings or cook two recipes at once for a full meal without having to do it in batches or worry about overcooking one of the recipes.\nWho should avoid it:\nThis is a massive air fryer and will dominate whatever part of the countertop you keep it on. If you don't regularly cook for large groups, opt for one of the smaller, less expensive models on our list. This dual-basket model also has a smaller 6-quart model (two 3-quart baskets) and a massive 10-quart version (two 5-quart baskets) available.\nWant more info? Check out our full review of the Ninja Foodi Dual-Basket air fryer.\nRecent updates\nJuly 2025\nThe Ninja Crispi glass air fryer was tested and added as best air fryer overall\nThe Ninja 4-quart air fryer was tested and added as the best air fryer under $75\nThe Our Place Wonder Oven was tested and added as the best air fryer and toaster oven\nCompare air fryers\n| Air fryer | Size | Wattage | Controls | Cooking modes | Price |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Ninja Crispi glass air fryer | 4 quarts | 1,500 | Digital | Air fry, recrisp, reheat, mac crisp | $160 |\n| Ninja 4- or 6-quart air fryer | 4 quarts | 1,550 | Digital | Air fry, roast, reheat, dehydrate | $69 |\n| Dash 2-quart air fryer | 2 quarts | 1,500 | Analog | Air fry, roast, bake, dehydrate | $50 |\n| Ninja Foodi DualZone air fryer | 8 quarts (total) | 1,690 | Digital | Air fry, broil, bake, dehydrate, roast, reheat | $200 |\n| Instant Pot Duo Crisp | 6 quarts | 1,000 | Digital | Pressure cook, slow cook, air fry, roast, steam, bake, broil, warm, saut\u00e9 | $150 |\n| Breville Smart Oven Air | 0.8 cubic feet | 1,800 | Digital | Toast, broil, bake, roast, warm, pizza, air fry, reheat, slow cook | $350 |\nOther air fryers we tested\nDreo Chefmaker: This souped-up air fryer has a built-in thermometer and tons of smart features. It works ggreen t but I found myself just using the basic air fryer function which makes it hard to justify the $359 price.\nDash Tasti-Crisp: I don't have major complaints with this model's function, but it feels a little flimsy for $60.\nCrux Marshmello: This compact 3-quart air fryer did well in testing and the cooking basket was easy to clean. I wasn't a fan of the control panels, which sport cutesy LED images in place of words, and it wasn't abundantly clear what each one was for.\nPhillips air fryer: I had no issues with this air fryer and liked the sleek design and intuitive controls. It performed similarly to the Ninja 4-quart but that model, our top budget pick, costs $100 less.\nPowerXL Air Fryer: This is another small air fryer that did well in testing, but I prefer the controls and sleek design of the more budget-friendly Gourmia 2-quart.\nInstant Vortex: One popular option is the Instant Vortex. It's priced in line with the other air fryers in this group. The Vortex is made by the same company that created the groundbreaking Instant Pot electric pressure cooker. Despite that, I wasn't blown away by its results. Chicken wings and fried chicken were acceptable but not incredible and less juicy than what other fryers produced. My Brussels sprouts ended up overdone too, and frozen fries cooked unevenly.\nDash Compact Air Fryer: We found the Dash Compact Air Fryer to be underpowered. While the larger Dash Deluxe is a powerhouse, the Dash Compact struggled to air-fry almost everything we put inside it. Both french fries and Brussels sprouts were under-done and unevenly cooked. The only bright spot was chicken wings. They took 30 minutes, but I was treated to skin with some crunch.\nGoWise USA 8-in-1 Digital Air Fryer: You may not have heard of this brand, but this offering from GoWise is a solid choice. It didn't cook the skin of my chicken wings evenly. That said, french fries came out crispy and crunchy, with fluffy interiors. The fryer also roasted Brussels sprouts well, no mean feat for this group of appliances.\nChefman 3.5 qt. Analog Air Fryer: Another relatively affordable choice is the Chefman Analog Air Fryer. It's tiny, too, offering just 3.5 quarts of food-frying capacity. The appliance delivered decent chicken wings, but it undercooked the Brussels sprouts and frozen french fries. We also found the Chefman's timer control confusing. This dial is labeled in numerical increments of 10. The numbers are separated by groups of four dots, not nine, as you would expect.\nPowerXL Vortex Air Fryer: You might consider purchasing the PowerXL Vortex, but we recommend against it due to its steep price and mediocre frying performance. We had satisfactory results cooking chicken wings in it, but this machine overcooked Brussels sprouts, and the french fries were just OK.\nDeLonghi Rapid Crisp: The DeLonghi Rapid Crisp was one of the most expensive models we tested, and it just didn't live up to the price tag. While I liked the design and sturdy build and appreciated the small viewing window for watching the cooking progress, I found the buttons and interface clunky. There was no way to set an actual cooking temp, only presets, and even those weren't very intuitive.\nBeautiful Air Fryer by Drew Barrymore: This air fryer offering from the actor's new kitchen line performed well in the four rounds of testing. It showed good power and cooked chicken wings to a nice crispy outside and kept them juicy inside after about 25 minutes. The air fryer's interface is slick, although I liked the Ninja's simpler control panel more, which is one of a few reasons it edged out this unit for best air fryer overall. This is a great option and is about $30 cheaper than the Ninja. It also has a pleasing design with smooth matte plastic (which does smudge a bit).\nHow we test air fryers\nTo date, we've tested well over a dozen air fryers to curate this list. Each air fryer is evaluated for its power, consistency, ease of use, design, features and overall performance. In total, we've logged results for more than 20 air fryers and over 75 hours of air fryer testing.\nThere are hundreds of recipes that can be made with an air fryer but we stuck to the basics and focused on the most popular foods people associate with air fryers. Chicken wings are at the top of that list, but french fries, frozen snacks and dense vegetables -- in this case, Brussels sprouts -- are air fryer food staples. Before we began, we consulted each model's manual for relevant cooking directions. If the manual didn't provide specific instructions, we applied uniform procedures to each air fryer depending on the type of food we were preparing.\nFor chicken wings, we followed a basic air fryer recipe. First, we preheated the air fryer to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and cooked them for 25 minutes in the basket with the included tray, then checked on them and turned them every 8 minutes. Most of the air fryers we tested had a solid showing in the wing test, although some, including the powerful Ninja and Cosori Lite models, got the wings a bit crispier in that amount of time.\nFor Brussels sprouts, we preheated the ovens to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and cooked them for 15 minutes. Before cooking, we rinsed and cut the sprouts in half and tossed them with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. In this test, some ovens struggled to brown the outside of the sprouts, but most got there eventually.\nFor the french fry test, we opted for Alexia's frozen crinkle-cut fries and cooked 1 cup, according to the air fryer directions on the bag. Quick note: Be careful when cooking fries in an air fryer as some types, especially thinner-cut fries, can dry out easily when hit with super-convection. We recommend heftier waffle fries, tater tots, crinkle cut or potato wedges over the shoestring variety.\nAt the end of each test, we looked for how evenly the items were cooked, if they were cooked through and whether they had a sufficient level of crispy, crunchy, fried goodness comparable to deep frying or pan frying.\nEase of use\nBeyond cooking performance, how easy an air fryer is to operate and how intuitive the buttons and controls were something we observed closely during testing. Overly complicated settings, controls and presets didn't generally result in high marks, but certain features were appreciated. All air fryers have base-level control over the temperature and cook time, although some are controlled digitally while others require the crank of simple manual dials. From there, you'll find preset programs for various foods such as wings, fries, fish, veggies and even baked goods.\nHow well they cook\nTo get a sense of how each air fryer in this test group handles, we ran a battery of three tests on each model. Each test focused on one food: chicken wings, Brussels sprouts and frozen french fries.\nWhat health experts say about air fryers\nThe Cleveland Clinic: \"They [air fryers] won't magically remove the saturated fat from bacon or the trans fats from a bag of processed chicken wings. To reap the benefits, reach for better-for-you options like vegetables and lean proteins....Think of the air fryer as a way to enhance healthier foods, so they're even more tempting.\"\nMedical News Today: \"Research on the effects of air-fried food is promising. Air fryers appear to be a healthy alternative, offering flavors similar to fried food with fewer adverse effects.\"\nBritish Heart Foundation: \"If you often eat deep-fried foods, switching to an air fryer could be helpful.\"\nBuying guide: What to consider when choosing an air fryer\nAn air fryer can bring efficiency and simplicity to your nightly meal routine. It's easy to make a quick and delicious meal with the best air fryers in your kitchen. They are not only healthier than an oven but also use less energy. Check out the complete guide to air fryers to learn more about these great kitchen appliances.\nPod-shaped air fryers vs. air-frying toasters\nWhile the idea of a toaster oven that doubles as an air fryer is a good one, and the air frying function on many of the hybrid machines is proficient, certain foods we love cooking in an air fryer are too messy to cook in a toaster.\nAll pod air fryers have removable cooking baskets and most of them are nonstick. When you're cooking chicken thighs with a sauce or even veggies drizzled with oil -- a few favorites -- there is going to be some inevitable splatter. Air frying mode is intense, with high convection heat circulated at a fast pace. Do this in a toaster oven, which is markedly more difficult to clean, and you'll be dealing with some serious caked-on gunk after the first few dozen uses.\nPod air fryers, on the other hand, take very little effort to get clean. Most air fryer baskets are now thicker and also nonstick. Beware of thin wire baskets, which can be tougher to clean. Both types can be removed to soak in the sink and some can be run through the dishwasher. The same can't be said for the inside walls of a countertop oven.\nIf you're buying a toaster oven, there's no reason not to get one with an air fryer function. It can still be used for less splatter-prone foods such as potatoes, frozen empanadas and filets of salmon with too much risk of making a mess.\nFor more, read CNET's complete guide to air fryers.\nAir fryer size\nWhile there are several features to consider, the size of your air fryer is likely the most important decision you'll make. If you're typically cooking for one or two people, a 2- or 3-quart air fryer should be large enough. Consider adding another quart of capacity to your air fryer for every person that you're regularly cooking for.\nA family of four or five, for instance, should be fine with a 5-quart model. If you plan on regularly cooking full meals for a family, including meat and veggies or sides, you might consider a larger, dual-basket air fryer like the Ninja DualZone.\nAll that said, the smaller the air fryer you can get away with the better. I've found that smaller air fryers such as the Magic Bullet 2- to 5-quart model and Instant Pot's Duo Crisp net better results since food will get blasted faster and more often than inside a larger model. Smaller air fryers mean less overall capacity, so you may have to cook in batches.\nPower\nMost air fryers are somewhere between 1,200 and 1,800 watts. Larger air fryers typically have more wattage and smaller models have less. Your midrange 4-quart air fryer should have about 1,500 watts. The small Magic Bullet and Gourmia air fryers have 1,300, but that's plenty of power to cook food in the petite basket. Larger air fryers should have about 100 more watts per quart to make sure they hit those hot temps of 400 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.\nAir fryer accessories\nSome fancy models may come with extra accessories, but all you need is an air fryer basket with wire or nonstick grates. They come standard with most air fryer models and help the super-convection to hit all sides of your food evenly. I prefer the nonstick variety as wire baskets can be particularly tricky to clean.\nShould you just get a normal air fryer or a multifunction model?\nThat depends on the type of cooking you'll do and what other appliances you already have. I like having a solo air fryer, but I'm also a fan of the Instant Pot Duo Crisp which functions as both an air fryer and a multicooker (also a pressure cooker and slow cooker).\nConsider how the air fryer looks, too\nAir fryers don't have to be kept on the counter but anything larger than 3 quarts might be tricky to store when not in use. Considering that, you should get an air fryer that compliments your kitchen. Both the Ninja and Cosori models are available in a range of colors (Cosori has more). There are also glass bowl air fryers and more modern-looking machines.\nAir fryer FAQs\nHow do air fryers work?\nThe air fryer is a simple cooking machine that employs hot, fast-circulating convection heat and a small fan to flash-roast food inside a contained frying basket. While there's generally no or very little oil used, the results can be similar to those of traditional frying in that food comes out crispy on the outside and (ideally) moist on the inside.\nAre air fryers energy efficient compared to ovens?\nWe did an analysis and found that a standard 4-quart air fryer will cost about 27 cents per hour to run. That's 50% more energy-efficient than the average full-size electric oven and about 35% more efficient than the average gas oven.\nWhat can you make in an air fryer?\nThe options for foods you can cook in an air fryer are vast, but some air fryer favorites include chicken wings, chicken tenders, french fries and mozzarella sticks. You can also make fish in an air fryer, including salmon, for a moist inside and roasted outer crust. Bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs are great when made in an air fryer, as are certain vegetables like Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, onions, peppers and carrots.\nIs using an air fryer healthier?\nGenerally speaking, air frying is a healthy way to cook. Cooking with an air fryer means you'll get foods that taste like they've been fried but with little or no oil. You can make healthier chicken wings, French fries, and cheese sticks without deep-frying or pan-frying in oil. Some foods do best in an air fryer with a light coating of oil, but most don't require any. Air fryers have become popular in part because they allow people to eat snack-type foods but with far less fat, cholesterol, and fewer calories.\nCan you cook raw meat in an air fryer?\nAs long as the raw meat is fully defrosted, you can place and even cook it in an air fryer with very little trouble. However, we do recommend using baking paper under the meat (either by covering the tray, or cutting a fine piece of the paper to put under your food) so that the juice collected doesn't collect at the bottom of your air fryer."

      "text": "There's nothing better on a cold winter evening than a nice warm crockpot meal -- especially one that's easy to throw together during the day and gives you a delicious homemade meal by night. Your slow cooker is also great during gatherings for easy appetizers or shareables for a group, like a dip or a chili.\nWhile using a slow cooker is an almost foolproof way to cook, there are a few common mistakes you can make that might mess up your meal. Luckily, they're easy to avoid, so the only thing you need to worry about is if there are enough for second helpings.\nHere are five slow cooker mistakes you might be making, and how to fix them. You can also find out why using a slow cooker could save you money compared to using the oven, and our picks for the best air fryers of 2023.\n1. Using too much liquid\nWhen you're cooking meat or poultry in your slow cooker, you want there to be some liquid to cover the ingredients. But you don't want to fill it all the way up with broth, stock or water. There's no reason to add more liquid than the recipe calls for (or more than enough to cover the ingredients if you're someone who does these things by feel), unless your slow cooker owner's manual says otherwise.\nIf you add too much liquid to your slow cooker, it will heat up and evaporate as steam -- but then will get trapped by the lid and drip back down into your food, making it too watery. Yuck.\nAvoid the messy crockpot cleanup by grabbing these slow cooker liners. Throw one in your cooker before you put food in it, and then simply remove it after you're done with the meal -- no scrubbing necessary. These are heat-resistant and BPA free, and come in different size options depending on your crockpot.\n2. Adding dairy products too early\nMany slow cooker recipes call for cheese, milk, sour cream or other dairy products. But you don't want to add them until the last few minutes of cooking -- otherwise, they may curdle and ruin your dish.\n3. Opening the lid for a peek\nThe same way you don't want to open the oven door too often when you're baking, you don't want to lift the lid on your slow cooker as it's cooking. Doing so lets heat escape and can dramatically lower the temperature inside the pot, which means it'll take longer to cook your food properly.\nRead more: Best Instant Pot Accessories for 2023\n4. Filling the slow cooker all the way up to the top\nYou shouldn't be filling your slow cooker to the brim with ingredients. It needs space between the food and the lid to prevent it from boiling over. The heat inside also needs room to circulate and cook the food the right way. Generally, you shouldn't fill your slow cooker more than three-quarters full.\n5. Adding herbs at the start\nAny dried or fresh herbs you're using should be added toward the end of your cooking time. If you add them at the start, they'll lose their potency by the time everything else cooks, and you'll be left with less flavorful food.\nFor more tips, check out whether it's cheaper to buy groceries online versus in the store, and the trick to reheating your leftovers so they taste great."

      "text": "Can\u2019t find great meat at your local grocery store? You\u2019re not alone. Premium cuts can be hit-or-miss at supermarkets, and when you do find them, they often come with a hefty price tag. That\u2019s where meat delivery services come in. These subscription boxes and online butchers deliver high-quality beef, chicken, pork and more straight to your doorstep -- sometimes at better prices than your neighborhood store.\nOur Picks\nWhether you're craving grass-fed steaks, organic chicken or specialty cuts like bison, duck or lamb, these services make it easy to stock your freezer with top-tier protein, no butcher counter required.\nWhat's the best meat delivery service overall?\nRastelli\u2019s, known for its impressive quality and variety, impressed us most out of the dozen or so services we've tried. It's earned a spot atop our list of the best meat delivery services for 2025.\nFrom premium meat -- Wagyu and Kobe beef and Berkshire pork -- to more budget-friendly cuts such as flank and skirt steak, there's almost no end to your options when you order from online meat subscriptions and delivery services. There are also options to add chicken, lamb, sausages and seafood to your cart.\nBelow you'll find all the best meat delivery services and subscriptions for 2025, as tested by CNET.\nBest meat delivery services for 2025\nPros\n- Great weekly specials\n- Meat is high-quality and always arrives looking fresh\n- Selection is well curated\nCons\n- Beef can be expensive\n- No subscription option\nWhat I liked:\nRastelli's started out as a small butcher shop in New Jersey serving its local community, but it's always put a premium on the best meat possible and is driven by a love of good food. Prices vary depending on which butcher box you choose, and there are many options, including steak craft burgers, hardwood smoked bacon or grass-fed filet mignon. You can buy any curated box as a one-off meat delivery service purchase but will save if you subscribe.\nWho is it for:\nThose who want quality beef that's a step up from most store-bought. Today it ships beef, poultry and seafood across the US from farms that produce responsibly raised meats free of antibiotics, steroids and hormones. It also sources wild-caught and sustainably raised seafood like Faroe Island salmon.\nWho should avoid it:\nRastelli's gives a good amount of information on each product but it's not exhaustive, for better or worse. You can read about where the market sources most of its meats, but the information is a bit general. If you're extremely meticulous about knowing the exact farm and farming practices associated with your meat, there are other delivery services that go a little further.\nPros\n- Excellent value if you already eat grass-fed beef, organic chicken and wild salmon\n- Eco-friendly packaging\n- Sign-up offers are great\nCons\n- Subscription only\n- Can't choose what comes in your box\nWhat I liked:\nButcherBox is a meat subscription service that offers a few types of meat but puts an emphasis on its 100% grass-fed and pasture-raised Australian beef. Grass-fed beef is said to be higher in antioxidants, vitamins and healthy fatty acids since it's pastured and its meat products are not raised on feedlots. Some say grass-fed has a purer beefy taste too. Australian beef is some of the most highly regulated in the world.\nThe company also offers heritage breed pork from pigs with plentiful outdoor access and an all-vegetarian diet from forage and feed, and free-range, organic chicken that's humanely raised, with no antibiotics or added hormones. It makes a point of mentioning that it works with \"the best possible meat processing facilities\" and believes in fair labor practices too.\nAll of the meat is vacuum-packed and frozen, and shipping is free.\nWho is it for:\nThose who eat enough meat to warrant a subscription but want to save over grocery store prices. Butcher Box starts at $146 a month. I compared this to what it would cost to buy meat from the grocery store and the supermarket tally was $30 more. As a bonus, the company is usually running some sort of promotion, like free bacon for the life of your subscription or a huge surplus of free meat in your first shipment.\nWho should avoid it:\nIf you don't mind getting a surprise mix of meats in each delivery, ButcherBox is a great deal. When you sign up with this online butcher, you can choose from all beef, beef and chicken, beef and pork, a mixed box or create a custom box. In any case, you select from two different box sizes depending on how many people you're feeding (or how big your freezer is).\nIf you want complete control, it'll cost you. The Custom Box is $169 a month but allows you to take your pick of over 20 different cuts including ground beef, top sirloin steaks, strip steaks, chuck roast, pork tenderloin, boneless pork chops, chicken breasts and drumsticks.\nPros\n- Sends mostly fresh meat, not frozen\n- Sources from small farms and independent producers\n- Small but carefully curated selection\nCons\n- Shipping is more expensive for those on the West Coast\n- Items frequently sell out\nWhy I liked it:\nBased in Nashville, Porter Road offers a variety of cuts of prime beef, pork, lamb and chicken, sourced from Kentucky and Tennessee. Its beef is pasture-raised, grass-fed and grain-finished, but the company uses no added hormones or antibiotics and the animals are free to roam and graze. It's largely a subscription model, but you can order a la carte cuts including pork chops, NY strip steaks, filet mignon, ribeye and ground beef, to less common cuts like Denver steak, lamb T-bones and andouille sausage. You can also add items to your meat subscription. (\"Put a bird on it\" if you'd like to have chicken next week.)\nWho is it for:\nThose who want quality fresh meat. Most of the company's meat is shipped fresh, but depending on the cut, some will be frozen.\nWho should avoid it:\nSubscriptions start at $155. You'll get less meat than with ButcherBox's entry-level subscription but the quality is higher for many of the cuts. Specialty selections include the Breakfast Box and a Grilling Heroes Box ($110) with dry-aged steaks, dry-aged burger patties and bratwurst sausage links, with 6 pounds of meat.\nPros\n- Huge selection of Prime and Wagyu beef and Kurobuta pork\n- Free shipping on orders over $199\n- Seafood available to add to order\nCons\n- Meat is pricey\n- No subscription option\nWhat I liked:\nSnake River Farms meat delivery service (and its partner, Double R Ranch) offer something special: Not only dry-aged, USDA Prime beef but American Wagyu (Kobe-style) beef, known for its rich marbling, tender texture and fantastic flavor. All Snake River Farm cows are raised sustainably and humanely in the Northwest, and it offers heritage breed Kurobuta Berkshire pork from pigs raised on small family farms in Idaho and the Midwest.\nIn addition to its exclusive (and accordingly expensive), chef-approved cuts of rare steak, it touts several sustainable ranching practices, from rotational grazing that promotes healthy rangelands to composting cattle waste and using beef tallow for fuel. Even the shipping foam in each butcher box can be dissolved and used as plant food, composted or used as a fire starter. In addition, the meat products company is a founding member of Beef Counts, which helps provide food to families in need.\nWho is it for:\nIf you've come to Snake River, you're there for the Wagyu. While the company doesn't offer recurring meat delivery service subscriptions, you can buy all sorts of individual cuts like American Wagyu black grade cap and ribeye (prices vary), not to mention Wagyu burgers and hot dogs. Plus, Snake River has Kurobuta pork bacon and baby back ribs if it's pork you're after.\nWho should avoid it:\nThose seeking budget-friendly meat. Most Wagyu products are offered in both Gold Grade (the highest quality -- and price -- available) and Black Grade (still special but slightly less devastating to the wallet). As with most other meat delivery services, your cuts will come vacuum-sealed and frozen. Shipping costs $10 for standard shipping or $50 for rush shipping, or you can get free standard shipping on orders over $199.\nPros\n- Recurring boxes and subscriptions can be customized\n- Huge selection of meat and seafood\n- Members get better prices\nCons\n- Not as much transparency about souring\n- $99 order minimum\n- Paid membership required for best prices\n- Options can be overwhelming\nWhat I like:\nCrowd Cow aims to \"create an alternative to the current meat commodity system\" by connecting consumers to quality meat from a carefully curated selection of small farms and independent ranches around the world. The specific offerings range from grass-fed beef and both Japanese and American Wagyu to pork, chicken and American-raised lamb (bison is a recent addition). There's even a grocery store selection of sustainable seafood for those craving surf and turf. You have the option to search by specific cut or type of meat or by the actual farm itself.\nNo matter what meat box or seafood selection you choose, your haul arrives frozen and packaged in 100% recyclable and compostable materials. And it includes information on which farm it came from, making this a perfect option for those seeking transparency in addition to delicious meat.\nWho is it for:\nCustomers who want the option for a subscription but also to purchase items a la carte, including organic, free-range chicken, bone-in pork chops or grass-fed ground beef. You can set your order to recurring and it'll ship monthly. You can then modify it whenever you like.\nWho should avoid it:\nThose who prefer a simpler subscription. Crowd Cow has an expansive offering with hundreds of meat and seafood offerings.\nPros\n- Large selection of premium cuts\n- Perfect for gifting\nCons\n- Very expensive\n- Limited selection\nWhat I like:\nThe newcomer to the high-end meat delivery game sells the best American-raised Wagyu with a deep portfolio of top A5-grade Japanese Wagyu producers on the planet. This includes ultrarare Hokkaido snow beef and beloved Kobe beef. On the website, you can sift through \"collections\" such as Japanese Wagyu, American Wagyu, USDA Prime Black Angus, Akaushi, steak flights and Wagyu burgers.\nYou can order one-time boxes or custom orders for yourself or choose from carefully curated beef boxes to send as a gift or care package. Enjoy free ground shipping when you spend more than $199 (not hard to do).\nWho is it for:\nIf you're looking for the very best in beef and have a few extra pennies to spend on the good stuff.\nWho should avoid it:\nBudget shoppers. Holy Grail does sport an impressive menu, but it ain't cheap. Your best meat box bet here is buying in bulk versus purchasing in smaller quantities, which is much pricier.\nPros\n- Budget-friendly prices\n- Offers full inventory of groceries, not just meat\n- Good customer service\nCons\n- Membership required\n- Meat sold in large quantities\nWhat I like:\nOnline grocery provider Thrive Market is also a one-stop shop, in a somewhat more traditional sense: The grocery store sells all manner of organic, 100% non-GMO, fair-trade products at wholesale prices, so you can buy various brands of things like paper towels, marinades and snacks, along with bundled boxes of meat and seafood.\nThe company's meat delivery options are many and include 100% grass-fed, free-range beef from small and midsize, family-run ranches and farms, pasture-raised chicken with organic options and wild-caught seafood. You can bundle and save with Thrive's Paleo Box with as much as 20 servings of mixed meat and seafood for $136.\nWho is it for:\nThose looking for an online source for meat and other groceries.\nWho should avoid it:\nSubscription-phobes.To shop from the site, you must pay a $60 annual membership fee (which nets you guaranteed savings and free gifts, plus sponsors a free membership for a low-income family), but you can sign up for a 30-day free trial to test it out first. The company guarantees you'll make back your membership in savings every year, but if not, will give you store credit for the difference.\nPros\n- Good deals on large orders\n- Bundles with sides and desserts available\n- Great for gifting\nCons\n- Meat is not as high-quality as others on our list\n- Website isn't the best\n- Prepared sides and dishes are just OK\n- A lot of salt used\nOmaha Steaks bills itself as \"America's Original Butcher\" and has certainly been in the carnivore-feeding business for a long time. Keeping up with the growing preference for grass-fed beef, both grain- and grass-fed are now offered (both options start with grass-fed but the signature beef is grain-finished).\nOmaha is solid but it's not where I'd turn for super high-end cuts. The company doesn't advertise organic meat as many others do, nor provide much specific information about how and where the animals are raised. But the range of items available is somewhat staggering. From various cuts of beef (steak galore, including cuts as big as 48 ounces) and some harder-to-find cuts of bison, veal and lamb. Omaha also stocks plenty of pork, chicken and seafood as well as charcuterie, full meal kits, a la carte side dishes and desserts and even dog treats.\nYou can find some pretty good value with this online butcher, especially if you're willing to buy in bulk. While Omaha doesn't offer subscriptions by name, there are plenty of gift boxes that will net you a whole lot of meat for an approachable price. There are also rotating discounts on some of Omaha's best sellers. Shipping prices vary based on order total and how fast you want your stuff, but you can find some \"free shipping\" deals and combos on the site. There's also a Steaklover Reward Points program for committed carnivores.\nPros\n- One of the most affordable meat delivery service\n- Most of whar we tried was fresh and easy to prepare\n- Some prepared foods and grocery add-ons\n- Good promo offers for new subscribers\nCons\n- Not as big a selection as some of the options on our list\n- No super premium selections\n- Ribeye was dissappointing\nWhat I liked:\nGood Chop is a newer meat delivery operation owned by HelloFresh and a direct competitor to ButcherBox. It's also one of the more affordable. Subscriptions start at $149 a month for 36 portions of meat and seafood. While the meat here isn't quite as premium as others on our list, nearly everything we tasted was fresh, tender and easy to prepare.\nYou can customize your meat box with chicken breast, sausages, salmon, pork chops, shrimp and lots and lots of juicy cuts of beef. There are also a few prepared foods including crab cakes, meatballs and cooked chicken for meal prep, though I didn't try any of those.\nWho is it for:\nThose looking to have shipments of meat delivered without breaking the bank.\nWho should avoid it:\nThe ribeye in my order was tough. Not a good pick if you're seeking super premium meat.\nPros\n- Top-quality steak from a legendary steakhouse\n- Includes a bottle of Peter Luger sauce\n- Makes a great gift\nCons\n- Very expensive\n- Limited options\nWhat I like:\nThe iconic Brooklyn steakhouse known for fatty t-bones, juicy burgers and a signature sweet steak sauce now send its beef to you or a giftee with a penchant for premium beef. The bundles of beef include porterhouse, strip and rib steaks along with burgers. Each shipment arrives fresh, accompanied by a bottle of legendary Lugar steak sauce. The porterhouse we tried arrived with intense marbleization and was a whopping 36 ounces. You can add some of the restaurant's famous thick-cut bacon or an extra three-pack of sauce for $20.\nWho is it for:\nA true beef fanatic or ex-New Yorkers who misses their beloved New York steakhouse.\nWho should avoid it:\nAt $156 for one 36-ounce porterhouse, this is best saved for a splurge gift for a meat eater with fondness for the lauaded steakhouse.\nPros\n- Best ribeyes we tested\n- All its beef products were great\n- Family-owned business\n- Cattle is pasture-raised\nCons\n- Limited to just beef\n- Shipping is $49\nWhat I liked:\nWhile the selection is limited to only beef at family-owned Eagle Rock Ranch out of Colorado, the pasture-raised and grain-finished ribeyes were some of the best out of all the meat delivery options I tried. Juicy, tender, marbled and fairly priced considering the quality -- $38 for a 16-ounce cut and. In addition to the ribeyes, Eagle Rock sells strips, burgers, marrow, beef hot dogs and filet mignon and stew meat.\nThere's a subscription option or you can build a box of beef or choose from one of two curated bundles of cuts. If you're really hungry, you can order a whole beef package that includes 425 to 450 pounds of packaged meat.\nWho is it for:\nLovers of quality beef, especially tender ribeye steaks.\nWho should avoid it:\nAnyone who wants a mix of meat types in their order, since this vendor sells only beef.\nRecent updates\nJune 2025\nGood Chop tested and added as best budget meat subsription.\nPeter Luger/Goldbelly tested and added as best meat delivery for gifting.\nEagle Rock Ranch tested and added as best meat delivery for ribeyes.\nHow we test meat delivery services at CNET\nTesting meat delivery services starts by scanning a website's online menus and subscription options. We then choose a popular bundle box or subscription to order and wait for it to arrive. Upon arrival, we examine the shipping containers for structural integrity, including any leaks or meat that's been defrosted during Transit. If meat is shipped Frozen, we expect it to arrive Frozen, and if it's shipped fresh, we make sure it's still chilled.\nWe defrost the meat, if necessary, according to instructions to gauge the visual quality of both meat and seafood. We then cook each cut according to instructions if they are given and taste the finished product before deciding if a meat delivery service is qualified to be on our list.\nMore abstractly, we compare the prices of any one we deliver to the category at large and grocery store averages to consider overall value.\n| Service | Subscription option | Delivery area | Shipping | Cost ($-$$$) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Rastelli's | No | Continental U.S. | Free with subscription | $$ |\n| Butcher Box | Yes | Continental U.S. | Free | $$ |\n| Porter Road | Yes | Continental U.S. | Free to $40 | $$ |\n| Snake River Farms | No | All 50 states | Free over $199 | $$$ |\n| Crowd Cow | Yes | Continental U.S. | Free over $149 | $ |\n| Holy Grail Steak Co. | No | Continental U.S. | Free over $199 | $$$ |\n| Peter Luger/Goldbelly | No | All 50 states | $35 | $$$ |\n| Thrive Market | Yes | Continental U.S. | Free over $120 | $ |\n| Omaha Steaks | Yes | All 50 states | Free over $149 | $ |\n| Good Chop | Yes | All 50 states | $10 | $ |\n| Eagle Ranch | No | All 50 states | $49 | $$ |\nWhat should you consider when picking a meat delivery service?\nSubscription or a la carte\nIf you want a meat subscription service that sends monthly packages of mixed beef, chicken pork and fish, Butcher Box, Porter Road. Crowd Cow or Omaha Steaks of curated sends so you don't have to think about it. Other services allow for one-time or recurring sends but you'll end up getting the exact same meat every time.\nType of meat\nDifferent meat delivery services specialize in different cuts of meat. You can find high-end beef including Japanese Wagyu and USDA Prime beef at premium online butchers Holy Grail and Snake River Farms or basic cuts from services like Crowd Cow and Omaha Steaks. Some services also offer wild salmon and other seafood options. Thrive Market has a full inventory of groceries to knock out more than just your meat order.\nFrozen or fresh\nMost services send meat flash-frozen to be defrosted or popped in the freezer for later. Porter Road and Omaha Steaks have the option for fresh, not frozen meat delivery if you prefer.\nCost and value\nMost meat subscriptions offer quality meat including grass-fed beef, organic chicken and wild fish. Because of that, it might be a step up in cost from your local supermarket. But depending on the type of meat you order, certain meat delivery services might actually save you money. If you order in bulk or scan the deals or sale sections of various online butchers, you can save even more with a meat delivery service.\nBest meat delivery services FAQs\nIs it easy to buy meat online?\nAs with meal kit subscriptions and grocery delivery services, companies that deliver meat and online butcher subscriptions have proliferated in the past several years. These services make it easy to use with express shipping and easy online markets to buy your favorite types of meat. Some specialize in grass-fed, pasture-raised, organic or Wagyu beef, while others focus on a wider range of fine meats and poultry, chicken cuts, sausage, cured meats or less common meats (such as wild boar and venison) that may not be sold at your neighborhood butcher.\nWhat's the cheapest place to buy meat online?\nCrowd Cow, Wild Fork Foods, Butcher Box and Amazon Fresh have the lowest prices of any meat delivery services we've tried.\nIs it easier to order meat online?\nIf you want access to more types of high-quality meat and specific cuts, ordering meat online is a clear choice.
