  "description": "Certain social posts can give the game away, possibly to potential wrongdoers. Here's when to hit pause before you post.",
  "content": "As we live more of our lives online, it's no surprise that burglars cruise social media to scout out their next victims. The obvious questions spring to mind: who's likely to be at home? Who's traveling? But while the Home Alone burglars had to get inventive to answer those questions, things are very different in 2025. The good news is that home security technology has led to a drop in burglaries over the past decade, but criminals are catching up. One of their latest tactics is eyeing our TikTok updates, new Insta pics and Facebook family updates for signs of when our homes are likely ot be the most vulnerable.\n\nEven if you think your social media feed is safe, it can be tough to really know who's watching your feed. With the right practices, though, you can start to protect yourself and give those bad guys the slip. Here are key social media mistakes to avoid, while still getting those likes -- take a look before you post.\n\nRead more: Best Ways to Keep Your Home Address Off the Web\n\nTravel is exciting and the perfect opportunity to post your influencer-level photos in exotic new locations, but that comes with a hidden risk. Showing everyone that you plan to be away from home (or are currently on a trip) could give burglars or other opportunists the green light to take advantage of an empty house. You'd be surprised how many people have returned from a vacation to find an unwelcome guest.\n\nPreparing your home security for a trip can help with this, but it's best to avoid the risk by waiting to post your vacation photos. Take a tip from the pros and schedule your in-the-moment vacation pics for later when you're home. Everyone gets to enjoy photos from your vacation but at a slightly later date.\n\nImportant note: The same is true if you're moving to a new address. Wait until the move is complete before you post.\n\nTagging real-time locations shows exactly where you are (and aren't)\n\nGeotagged photos or automatic location tagging shows where you are in real time as you post. It can be fun to show friends you arrived at a venue or checked into a favorite restaurant, but that also shows everyone else you aren't home right now. The same is true about posting a pic with geotags, even if you're just out and about the town.\n\nThis precise location data can give mischief-makers and thieves a tip that you aren't at home and your house may be open for trouble.\n\nTalking about your routine can tell burglars when to show up\n\nSocial media is packed with people listing out their daily routines and habits (do we really need to know about your 6am run?), but if you want to follow suit be careful just how much you share. Don't reveal the times of day you head to work or to the gym, for example.\n\nYou don't want anyone to have a record of when your home or room will be unoccupied. Thieves are already using security cameras to spy on homeowner routines; don't make things easier for them.\n\nAnother common mistake social media users make is posting a pricey new item they recently obtained. Sure, it's exciting to show off and share big buys like a new TV, a new PC setup, a collection of expensive miniatures, fancy new tools or new jewelry, but that's the sort of thing burglars watch for online.\n\nStay safe and keep those special purchases just between you and your IRL friends to cut down on the chances they get stolen.\n\nRead more: The 7 Most Common Home Security Mistakes to Stop Making\n\nIf you're not doing it, your kids could be\n\nFinally, keep in mind even if you're extra careful on social media, your kids (or your partner) may be less cautious. Younger social media users in particular may not recognize the dangers of posting all kinds of personal details, especially when a several-second video can get them a burst of recognition on TikTok.\n\nSo make sure your family also understands these risks and knows that there are certain things they shouldn't post online -- at least, not right away.\n\nDoes this stuff matter if your social posts aren't public?\n\nKeeping your social media restricted only to friends keeps your post much safer and we highly recommend it. But it's not a cure-all for these risks. First, it's hard to tell who is currently following you and if their acquaintances also have access to their social feed, especially if you have a lot of followers.\n\nSecond, as mentioned above, other family members may not be as cautious and could reveal details to people outside their circles.\n\nThird, some enterprising burglars may even spam fake account requests to access a huge amount of social profiles at once and glean whatever information they can. It's pretty rare, but that's also why you don't accept random requests without some kind of connection.\n\nFor more information on how to keep your home safe, you should stop by our tips on stress-free living alone, our broad home security cheat sheet and tips to prevent all kinds of break-ins.",

      "text": "From summer vacations to evenings of play, you'll want to make sure your home is safe when you're away. And that certainly includes your yard and front porch, where CNET surveys have found that 1 in 6 adults have been victims of porch theft. But the right home security has a say about that, too.\nThe right smart devices, tips and home practices can keep all intruders at bay and stop break-ins before they happen -- prevention, after all, is the best strategy. Here's what I suggest to stay one step ahead with your home security and keep trespassers from causing any harm.\n1. Set motion detection lights to stun\nLook for a security camera that's equipped with a spotlight or floodlights. You can set these lights to trigger via motion detection, and thanks to recent advantages, camera sensors are now smart enough to ignore cars and focus on people, among other useful tricks. The lights will let determined trespassers know that there's a security system, and even indicate that a camera is currently recording them. That's a powerful reason to get away if intruders have ill intent!\nRemember, apps from popular smart home brands like Arlo, Ring, Blink and many others allow you to set zones and control motion sensitivity so your security lights only turn on when a person gets close, instead of lighting up a dozen times a night.\nRead more: I Thought I'd Hate AI in Home Security. I Couldn't Have Been More Wrong\n2. Put up a security system yard sign\nYou may have already suspected it, but studies do confirm that burglars -- around 83% surveyed -- are scared off by signs that an alarm system is present, and one of the most straightforward is a literal sign or window sticker.\nWe suggest avoiding cheap, fake signs, which are usually easy to recognize by someone already thinking about a break-in. Fortunately, real signs come included even with common DIY security systems like those offered by SimpliSafe. And if you're worried about a burglar using a sign to learn too much about your home security system, these sorts of hacking tales hardly ever actually happen.\n3. Install a video doorbell for front door protection\nIt's hard to miss a video doorbell when approaching a front door or porch. From Google Nest to Arlo, Ring and Aqara, these doorbell cameras make it obvious that someone's watching. They come equipped with two-way audio and quick replies that can hold brief conversations, and if visitors recognize a video doorbell, they probably know it's already sent alerts to the owner about front door activity.\nThose qualities make doorbells an excellent method to deter porch pirates and other troublemakers. We also recommend planning for video storage so you have a way to save and download or share video clips when necessary.\n4. Use alerts to call an audible\nAll the top home security cams now come with two-way audio features, which are one of the most effective deterrents if you notice something is wrong. Nothing can scare away a trespasser quite like the owner flipping on the speaker and calling out, \"HEY! What are you doing?!\" Plus, if it's just a very lost postman, you can always apologize afterward without getting the police involved.\nTwo-way audio works well with timely camera alerts on your phone and object recognition so the alerts specify that a human was detected.\n5. Set up sirens on home security devices\nThey aren't quite as ubiquitous as two-way audio, but many cameras and most home security kits also include sirens. On today's smart devices you have the option to turn on sirens with the app, or set the siren to sound off when certain kinds of motion are detected and the system is armed. It's a quick addition you can activate during setup, even for the smallest cams like the Blink Mini 2.\n6. Position access sensors on windows and backdoors\nAccess sensors enable a bunch of the tips we listed above if someone actually enters your home. They send alerts that allow you to immediately look through live views from cameras, use two-way audio in a shouty way or sound off a siren/flip on a floodlight. If you're worried about burglars breaching points like these (especially if you've had it happen before), the top home security system kits include sensors for exactly these reasons.\n7. Set vacation modes with smart lights and more\nSmart security systems and home cams have an additional feature to help make vacations easier: They have vacation modes and customizable away modes. You can pair these modes with smart lights and set an activity schedule that makes it look like people are still home when you're away.\nVacation modes like these will turn lights on and off to mimic people getting home in the evening, waking up in the morning and other everyday activities. They can discourage thieves looking for empty homes that make easy targets, and give you extra peace of mind on long vacations. These modes also pair very well with cams that let you take a peek as long as you have a reliable internet connection and access sensors that tell you when something went wrong.\n8. Keep your garage closed and locked\nMany burglaries are crimes of opportunity, and one opportunity that can easily attract thieves (and racoons) is a garage door that's been left open. Consider equipping your garage door with a smart door system that can automatically close the door for you, secure it and remind you if the door is left open for any reason.\nThese smart garage doors are frequently backward-compatible with existing garages, especially newer models, but you should always check how they work before you buy a new system.\n9. Equip your door with a smart lock\nForgetting to lock the front door isn't quite as noticeable as leaving the garage open, but it can still attract thieves, who won't be shy about rattling doorknobs to see if entry is easy. A smart lock is a simple, incredibly effective way to monitor your main entry and make sure it's always locked at the right times.\nToday's smart locks can auto-lock after a period of inactivity, or send you reminders that they're open, so you can make a judgment call yourself. They also come with ways to give friends and family temporary passes to use the lock with their own phones, and options to review your access history.\n10. Use an active professional home-monitoring service\nConsider adding professional home monitoring to your security system for the most complete protection. Professional monitoring allows agents to view their alerts and contact emergency responders if necessary, so you don't have to rely on your own notifications.\nThese monitoring plans don't have to be exorbitantly expensive: Arlo's Secure Premium plan offers full family monitoring services for $25 per month. Take a look at SimpliSafe's Fast Protect plan, which offers guides that look at cam live views and use audio to ask questions, for around $30 per month. Monitoring plans can take your home security to the next level if you don't mind the extra expense.\n11. Add a delivery lock box to your porch\nA package lock box is a very simple, very effective addition to your home that shuts down porch piracy entirely. It works a lot like public package drop-offs, with one area where delivery people can drop in a package, and a holding area only accessible to the owner via key or keypad. Thieves can't get inside at all. Advanced models like Loxx Boxx also give you app control, remote access and alerts about when you get a delivery. This could be the perfect deterrent if you have porch-pirate problems in your neighborhood and get packages frequently.\nWhat about guard dogs as a security bonus?\nMany sources suggest getting a guard dog as a home theft deterrent. We do not recommend getting a dog specifically for security purposes, even if they're effective. It's not very fun for the dog, and it's difficult to train one to be wary of the wrong kind of strangers (and not, say, cousin Jimmy who's never been to your home before). Also, dog attacks regularly lead to trespassers suing homeowners for their injuries, and some states have liability laws that can encourage such lawsuits.\nSince staying safe is already on your mind, you can check out our recommendations for the top DIY home security systems, as well as ways to save money like turning an old phone into a security cam. And if you live with roommates, you'll want to peruse our guide on the best tech to keep your own room safe."

      "text": "Your iPhone keeps track of your location, but it's usually for a good reason. Apps depend on accurate location tracking to function properly, like when you're getting directions in Google Maps or using Find My to locate your lost phone. And if you didn't know, that precise location feature extends to the photos and videos you take on your iPhone.\nAny time you snap a photo or record a video with your iPhone, it creates information related to the file -- including the creation date and your location -- and then stores this metadata within your media.\nAlthough metadata has useful and even essential purposes, it can become a privacy issue -- especially when it comes to your location. If someone has access to the photos you took on their smartphone, they can easily scour the metadata to identify locations and discover where you live, work, or study.\nFortunately, Apple has made it easy to remove (or even spoof) your location from photos and videos you take on your iPhone, so that prying eyes can't see where you are. We'll explain how to do it.\nFor more on iPhone privacy, check out privacy settings you need to double-check, how to prevent ads from tracking you across the web and Safari browser privacy settings to change.\nWhat exactly is photo metadata? The TL;DR version\nNearly every photo you take on your iPhone has a batch of hidden information stored within: metadata. This metadata, known more specifically as EXIF data for images, contains descriptive information that makes each image unique. That includes the creation date, camera information and settings and your location.\nThis information allows apps to quickly identify photos and organize them. On your iPhone, it's why you can do something like arrange your photos by date taken, or why iOS can create those personalized Memories videos of you on vacation.\nSo metadata is extremely useful, unless it gets in the wrong hands. Someone with access to the metadata can discover where you go and where you live, and you can see how that could become a problem. If that gives you the creeps, you may want to strip the location metadata from your photos and videos.\nHow to remove your iPhone photos' location information\nUnderneath every photo you take on your iPhone, you can see a map showing the approximate location of where the photo was taken. Here's how to access this information and remove a photo's location:\n1. In the Photos app, navigate to the photo you want to adjust.\n2. Now, either swipe up on the photo or tap the info (i) button to view the photo's information.\n3. Next, tap Adjust on the bottom right corner of the map. This will show the exact address or location where the photo was taken.\n4. Finally, tap No Location. You'll be redirected back to the photo's information, where the map will then disappear and the location metadata will be gone.\nHow to spoof a photo's location metadata\nIf you don't want to remove the location metadata, you can always spoof it, which means you assign another location to a photo instead. Although removing the location is preferred for privacy reasons, spoofing could make someone think you're somewhere else, such as in another country.\n1. Go back into the Photos app, choose a photo and swipe up to view the photo's information.\n2. In the map that appears, tap Adjust.\n3. At the top of the Adjust Location page, enter a location or address into the search area. As you type, suggestions will appear underneath.\n4. Choose the location you want to give the photo. This will become the photo's new location stored in the metadata.\nHow does my iPhone track my location?\nYour iPhone uses something called Location Services to pinpoint your phone's location, using a combination of GPS, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi hotspots and cell tower locations.\nIt's what helps you find local events on Eventbrite, browse through movie times in the Cinemark Theatres app or tag where you are on Instagram -- and it's what marks your location anytime you take a photo.\nIsn't it good that my iPhone photos are geotagged?\nFor the most part, having your photo location tracked, or geotagged, is a good thing. Using search in the Photos app, you can enter a location like \"Los Angeles,\" and every photo you've ever taken in LA will appear. Every so often, I enjoy scrolling through the photos I took on vacation, which are easy to find only because of their location metadata.\nSo why should I care?\nIn the wrong hands, metadata can be used for malicious purposes.\nFor example, let's say you just met someone new, maybe from a dating site, and you're interested in them. You take a few selfies at home and you send them via text. But before you can meet this person in person, things go sour and you end contact.\nHowever, they have your photos, and with that, they could also have the metadata that can show where you live, work, eat or visit, depending on where you took the photos you sent. And for privacy reasons, that may make you uncomfortable.\nYou don't have to worry about photos you upload to social networks\nFortunately for you, not all your photos or videos will contain location metadata, because it may have been wiped for you. For example, any photos or videos you upload to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other social media services have their EXIF data stripped, for privacy reasons. If someone downloads your photos from your social media accounts, there's no way they can figure out your location from the metadata.\nWhat else can I do to protect myself?\nHowever, if your privacy concerns aren't quelled by this metadata-stripping technique on your iPhone, you can always completely disable Location Services in your settings so that every single photo or video you take won't have location metadata stored within:\n1. Open the Settings app.\n2. Tap on Privacy > Location Services.\n3. Scroll down and tap on Camera.\n4. Select Never.\nOnce Location Services is disabled for the Camera app, you'll no longer see location metadata for the photos and videos you take.\nWhether you're a new user or hardened veteran on the iPhone, here are some of iOS 16's best hidden features and everything new on iOS 16."

      "text": "I used to think I had to overhaul everything -- eat perfectly, work out daily, meditate, journal -- to feel better. But the biggest changes came from the smallest shifts.\nOnce I started building in a few simple habits each day, things actually started to click. I had more energy, less stress and felt way more in control of my health. Nothing extreme, just easy, science-backed habits I could stick with.\nHere are a few that made the biggest difference for me, and might just help you feel better, too.\nIncorporate these science-backed habits to take the next step toward better physical and mental health.\n12 daily habits to improve your health\nHere, we're talking about small adjustments that benefit every human. With these minor modifications to your daily routine, you can start working toward better health without having to give up a ton of time, money or enjoyment.\n1. Prioritize sleep\nGoing without sleep is a lot like expecting your phone to run all day on a 12% battery. Your body needs time to not just rest and recharge, but also to do important work, like learning new things and solidifying memories.\nAdults should get at least 7 hours of shut-eye each night. If this is a challenge for you, turn to your circadian rhythm. This is your body's natural process that should help you fall asleep, stay asleep and wake up feeling refreshed.\nHow do you use your circadian rhythm for better sleep? Go to bed and get up at the same time every day.\n2. Walk more\nHeading out for a stroll boosts your physical and mental health, so it's well worth adding to your list of healthy daily habits.\nOn the physical front, regular walking supports your immune system, reduces joint pain and makes it easier to maintain a healthy weight.\nAny exercise helps your mental health, and that includes walking. If you want to shift your daily habits to combat symptoms of depression or anxiety or to boost your mental wellness in general, make it a point to lace up your walking shoes each day.\n3. Read for 30 minutes\nFeeling stressed? Crack open a book. One study found that a half hour of reading can have the same stress-busting effect as known sources of calm, like yoga and humor.\nReading also does a lot for your brain, like strengthening connections. That study showed that diving into a book has both short- and long-term benefits for your brain health. So, make reading one of your daily habits to maintain the boost. When you do, you'll also be actively working to fight cognitive decline as you age.\n4. Meditate\nAnother stress reducer and mental health booster, meditation gives you a way to tune into the present moment. In our busy, hyperconnected world, this can go a long way toward not just keeping yourself healthy, but also protecting your happiness.\nStarting meditation could be as simple as doing a little reading on it and setting a timer for, say, 5 minutes each day. There are also plenty of good apps to guide you. You can even incorporate a meditative mindset into your regular activities, such as mindful eating.\n5. Spend time in nature\nGetting into nature can help us soothe ourselves. It offers an effective counterbalance to all the screentime built into most of our days. An expanding body of research shows that time in nature can:\n- Improve our cognition\n- Increase attention span\n- Lower risk of mental illness\n- Increase empathy and social connectedness\nYou can combine this with other healthy habits, like your daily walk. Ideally, aim for green (like a forest) or blue (like bodies of water) spaces during your time outdoors.\n6. Eat more plant-based foods\nYou probably already know that eating nutritious food makes you feel better. As an overarching concept, healthy eating habits can feel a little vague.\nSo let's be specific: Work to get more plants onto your plate. A plant-supported diet helps you maintain healthy cholesterol and blood pressure levels and reduces your risk for some chronic conditions. Plants are full of the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients we need to keep our bodies working optimally.\nTry to incorporate more fruit, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes into your daily meals. It might be helpful to keep a produce bowl on your kitchen counter so you can grab things as a quick snack, too.\n7. Drink more water\nThis is one of those areas where it's easy to see how healthy habits help. Since we're mostly water, it makes sense that we would need to continually replenish our body's supply. Getting enough water helps your body flush waste and keeps your joints lubricated while acting as a shock absorber for your spine and helping your digestive processes.\nTo build healthy habits around water, start carrying a reusable water bottle with you. Whenever you're bored, take a sip. Your body will thank you.\n8. Reduce alcohol intake\nReducing the alcohol you consume does a lot for you, especially if you used to binge drink.:\n- Lowers risk of high blood pressure, depression and other conditions\n- Decreases symptoms of those conditions\n- Helps your body better absorb nutrients\n- Improves sleep and minimizes fatigue\n- Supports liver health\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that men have two drinks or fewer each day, while women stick to a max of one drink per day. To help yourself out here, figure out a nonalcoholic beverage you like a lot. Soda water, bitters and a lime can scratch the cocktail itch without adding another alcoholic drink to your daily total.\n9. Quit smoking\nDoes this come as any surprise? Smoking is bad for your heart and lungs, and it's also bad for your longevity. Long story short, if you want to live a longer, healthier life, kick the habit.\nAs you're figuring out how to be healthier, don't turn to vaping. It might be less harmful, but it's just as addictive and still comes with health risks.\nSmoking is one of the hardest daily habits to ditch. The CDC and the American Lung Association have resources to help.\n10. Spend time with those you love\nIf you're pursuing healthy habits to feel happier in 2024, hang with your people. Social connection goes a long way toward boosting our moods.\nIf you already have a group of friends or family, let this be a reminder to hit them up. Call someone you haven't talked to in a while or invite a few people over for a game or movie night. Check how you feel afterward. Better? We thought so.\nIf you don't have a social circle, make 2024 the year you intentionally work on making connections. That could mean striking up a conversation with a coworker or getting to know your neighbors.\n11. Take a break from electronics\nScreen time takes its toll. Studies directly link it with lower psychological well-being.\nFortunately, the reverse is true. A digital detox can:\n- Improve your sleep\n- Boost your focus and productivity\n- Reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety\n- Support real-life social connections (see the point above)\nYou could try going off social media apps for a while and see how you feel. If you want to incorporate this into your healthy daily habits, carve out time each day when you're screen-free. For better sleep, maybe make that the last hour before bed.\n12. Take up a new hobby\nYour healthy habits can also be fun and rewarding. What have you always wanted to do? Your answer to that question might point you toward a new hobby to explore in 2024. Getting into it can help you reduce stress and boost mental well-being.\nPlus, some hobbies can get you moving, supporting both your physical and mental health. Maybe you get into playing pick-up soccer at the park, or you could explore yoga.\nUltimately, you have a lot of options for healthy daily habits you could incorporate into your lifestyle. You can pick one or two, or go big and go for the full dozen. Either way, you'll be moving toward a healthier, happier you."

      "text": "Since their introduction, home security systems have made significant advances. They've gone from standalone home security cameras to robust systems with monitoring services. If you've been planning to improve your home security, in 2025, there's no shortage of options to choose from to help keep your family safe.\nOur Picks\nHOME SECURITY DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $250 (save $50)\n- $400 (save $50)\n- $400 (save $100)\n- $94 (save $66)\nWe recommend choosing a security system for several reasons -- chief among them, how easy it is to set up. You'll also know that all of your door/window sensors, motion detectors and glass-break sensors will work together with your alarm and other components. Indoor and outdoor cameras are usually optional but recommended if you're among the 71% of US adults looking to prevent package theft or if you want more advanced AI guarding features.\nWhat is the best overall home security system?\nWe've tested systems for more than 180 hours, including the latest kits and updates for 2025, and nothing beats SimpliSafe's starter kit as the top choice for the average homeowner. SimpliSafe's hardware packages start at $250 and go up to $734. However, we've observed that there are often deals that let you buy this security system for a discount. It's incredibly DIY friendly while also offering robust monitoring plans and sharp new AI features for those who want them. Anyone can install its compact sensors, including renters, thanks to the adhesive options.\nOur other options include kits for every kind of house. If you want a modular security kit you can easily build out over a couple of years, Vivint is your best choice. We also have an excellent self-install option with Ring Alarm -- which doesn't require a contract and has a relatively affordable subscription plan -- plus more picks for gifts, excellent existing smart home support and many other needs.\nBest home security systems of 2025\nPros\n- Easy to install and operate for DIYers\n- Very customizable\n- Adhesive sensors for apartments\n- Competitive pricing for multiple packages\n- From self-monitoring to AI services, a lot of subscription options\nCons\n- Limited smart home integration, keeping you in the SimpliSafe ecosystem\nWhy I like it:\nWe've tested the SimpliSafe systems several times and most recently gave their kit a review score of 8.5 out of 10, one of our highest ratings for a home security system and a perfect option for installing a system yourself. It offers a comprehensive set of features, including equipment like security cameras and a strong assortment of battery-powered motion detection sensors, all of which performed quite well in our tests. You can add everything from smoke detectors to panic buttons as add-ons, too. Devices are compact, easy to install and have adhesive options for avoiding damage to walls.\nStarter kits begin at about $250 with the typical discounts applied, or you can build a custom alarm system with the exact mix of devices you need. Self-monitoring plans start at $10 per month for basic camera support, but SimpliSafe adds a lot of interesting features for monitoring plans, which start at about $30 per month, including live guard watching and AI-powered alert systems to focus on strangers, providing a lot of options for every kind of user.\nWho is this for:\nDIY fans who want to handle all the details themselves but still want masterful options for professional monitoring, as well as renters looking for adhesive sensors.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nAnyone who wants a pro to take care of the installation.\nPros\n- Numerous third-party device integrations for other smart devices\n- Alexa and Google support\n- No contract required\nCons\n- High upfront charges\n- Difficult to decipher pricing without having to give your email address\n- Monitoring can be expensive starting at $30\nWhy I like it:\nVivint gives you a super-polished experience with third-party device integrations, and it doesn't require a contract. The starter package includes only a touchscreen and a couple of sensors, but Vivint works well with voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant and supports an array of additional Vivint and third-party devices (see our full review for more).\nThat's great news if you'd like to add a compatible smart garage door, video doorbell or security camera system, but on your terms and timing. You can also adjust your budget based on what you'd like to buy now and purchase later. Vivint is the only brand with this approach but it has one of the best offerings to begin with a starter kit and build from there.\nWith monthly monitoring ranging from $30 to $45 a month, this system is more affordable than a subscription service like ADT and includes valuable extras like video storage. But these are some of the highest subscription costs on our list. It's becoming less common for security brands to charge so much for professional monitoring, but for these systems, if you want the pros to keep an eye on your home, you'll have to pay for it.\nWho is this for:\nBuyers who want to start with the basics and add a host of smart devices over time.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who want to avoid high subscription costs.\nPros\n- 8-in-1 sensors\n- Affordable starter kits available for $150 with discounts\n- Integration with Arlo cams and tags\n- Great app controls\n- No contract\n- Voice assistant support for Alexa and Google\nCons\n- Grows much more expensive if you want to add video or monitoring\n- Very little third-party or voice-assistant support\nWhy I like it:\nArlo's system, which performed exceptionally in our tests, offers something different from most standard security kits: It uses an interesting type of all-in-one sensor that you can set to perform different tasks depending on where you want to put it. They can sense motion or when a door is opened, monitor temperature, check for leaks and more. With up to five in a package, you can recruit the system to perform a variety of home duties at prices lower than nearly any competitor.\nArlo's plan is necessary if you want something like professional monitoring or 24/7 emergency response but you can still get a plenty of functionality free. It also works very well with devices like the Arlo Doorbell and Arlo's new fob for quickly disarming the system. Add an Arlo cam and you can choose an advanced subscription with AI that can now recognize fires, screams, gunshots, barking and more.\nWho is this for:\nThis is an excellent kit for DIYers who want to save big while also having some very cool upgrades in the future if they want to add more.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nFans of more traditional home security systems and those who want to integrate a lot of smart devices.\nPros\n- Apple Siri support, Excellent third-party integrations\n- $8 to $26 subscriptions aren't \"must-have\"\nCons\n- Starter kits are a little limited and you have to pay more than $200 for better options\nWhy I like it:\nThanks to Abode\u2019s frequent deals, you can find home starter kits for as low as $100, one of the cheapest options on the market. We suggest going up a step and picking the $280 smart security kit, which adds a motion sensor to the package and expands smart home compatibility to Apple Home/Siri as well as Alexa and Google Assistant. We know it\u2019s not easy to find a home security system that works with the Apple Home app, especially at a low price, so Apple fans may be especially pleased.\nThe tidy package is easy to manage once you\u2019ve found a place for Abode\u2019s block hub, and DIYers will appreciate the no-tools installation design (which also makes this a great pick for renters). Abode also has deeply impressive third-party compatibility, supporting integrations with Amazon Echos, Ecobee, Nest, Philips Hue, Yale and more. If you already have smart devices, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll be supported; check out the full list here.\nAdding an $8 standard plan nets you AI object detection and more comprehensive alerts, while a $26 Pro plan provides professional monitoring and cellular backup. But those aren't must-have features for many users, so you can consider skipping the fees altogether.\nWho is this for:\nPeople who already have a lot of smart home devices and want to integrate as many as possible -- especially Apple users.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who want a lot of options on the basic starter kit without paying more money.\nPros\n- DIY-friendly starter kit\n- Easy to add other Alexa and Ring devices\n- Intuitive app controls\n- Includes a Wi-Fi range extender to help solve connectivity issues\nCons\n- Not so useful outside the Amazon ecosystem of Alexa and Ring\nWhy I like it:\nRing offers some home security packages for users who want to take everything into their own hands, from picking out add-ons to choosing just the right spot on the wall. This eight-piece starter kit provides four important sensors, a base station plus a keypad, a motion detector and a range extender for those worried about Wi-Fi. We also like the Pro version of this package, but the second-gen kit is a bit newer and doesn\u2019t force you to use the built-in router (we prefer picking out our own routers).\nAmazon\u2019s Ring devices include excellent Alexa support, and DIYers will like the largely intuitive management app (if you\u2019ve set up any smart devices before, these app controls will come easily to you). In addition to direct controls and sensor notifications, users can also switch between home and away modes on the fly. If you decide to expand, almost any Ring product will be compatible, including their security cameras and video doorbells, so it\u2019s easy to level up.\nTwo final important notes about choosing Ring: First, in 2024, Ring officially changed its policy on allowing police to directly request user video footage. Now they listen to such requests only in case of a life-or-death emergency, similar to Google and other brands but a noted improvement from its previous stance.\nSecond, while Ring is very DIY-friendly, professional monitoring does require the brand's top-tier subscription for $20 per month. That\u2019s lower than some of our other picks but still pricier than a cloud storage plan would be.\nWho is this for:\nDIYers who are also big fans of Alexa and Ring products.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who prefer to use other platforms beyond Amazon brands like Alexa and Ring.\nPros\n- Excellent Google Nest compatibility with Cams and Doorbells\n- New ADT+ app filled with customization features\n- New, more compact sensor designs\nCons\n- Clunky, expensive monitoring contracts often tallying more than $70 remain\n- ADT+ will be a lot to learn for those with no smart home experience\n- New app is sometimes buggy\nWhy I like it:\nADT has again reinvented its security system offerings in 2024 with ADT Plus, bringing a new app (source of the ADT Plus name), revamped devices and an even larger focus on the closely intertwined Google Nest. The result is better than ADT has been in years, although the required contracts and extra-pricey monitoring remain. This is an option for those who like Google Nest or already have Google Nest devices (which will be compatible with the ADT system). While there are self-install options, ADT's long-term experience makes it one of the best brands for professional quotes and installation.\nThe sensors on ADT's system are better than ever, and Nest integration allows for many new tricks like Trusted Neighbor entry time frames that can use facial recognition to automatically unlock doors. But the ADT Plus app offers a lot of settings and not-always-intuitive menus, so users new to home security will have a lot to learn.\nWho is this for:\nHomeowners who want a professional installation, fans of Google Nest products, and people who don't mind paying for a contract plan and learning a big new app.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nBuyers who want to stay away from high fees and prefer something simpler, people who don't like Google Nest at all.\nHome security systems compared\n| Best home security systems: | SimpliSafe (8-piece set) | Vivint Smart Home | Abode Home Security System | Ring Alarm Pro System (2nd-gen) | ADT Home Security with ADT+ | Arlo Home Security System 5-Piece |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| System price | Starting from $250 | $500 | $199 | $250 | Starting from $349 | $300 |\n| Monthly monitoring price | $10-$30 | $30-$45 | $25 | $20 | $40+ | $30 |\n| Starter equipment | Base station, keypad, motion sensor, four entry sensors, one panic button | Hub, two door window sensors, a motion detector, a flood sensor | Smart security hub, mini door/window sense, motion sensor, key fob | Eero Wi-Fi 6 mesh router, door-window sensors, motion detectors, a keypad, a siren and optional professional monitoring subscriptions | Keypad Hub, sensors, Nest cams/doorbells/hubs, will vary based on quote | Keypad, 5 8-in-1 sensors |\n| Contract required? | No | No | No | No | Yes | No |\n| Setup | DIY installation | Professional installation | DIY installation | DIY installation | Professional installation with some self-install options | DIY installation |\n| Extra features | Customizable system, built-in Wi-Fi and cellular, integration with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant | Customizable system, integration with many third-party devices, integration with Amazon Alexa, Google Home and Z-Wave devices | Customizable system, cellular backup, integration devices from Sonos, Nest and more, integration with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri | Cellular-powered backup Wi-Fi, network security monitoring, local processing, storage for all of your Ring devices and integration with Alexa's Guard Plus service | Integration with Google Nest devices and Google familiar face recognition | Compatible with Arlo cams, doorbells and tags, |\n| Review score | 8.5 | 7.7 | 8.3 | 9 | Upcoming | 8.3 |\nFactors to consider when choosing a home security system\nWhen choosing a home security system for your home, you may be tempted to start by deciding between a DIY setup or professionally installed systems with monitoring services. Remember to make your decision after considering the equipment, installation, monitoring options and other features you want. Here are some bits of information to keep in mind about these parameters when shopping around.\nEquipment choices\nDo you just need to keep watch over your entryways? A good video doorbell for your front door and an outdoor camera covering the back may be all you need; easy to install and monitor yourself. If you want to keep closer tabs on your home inside and out with 24/7 monitoring and quick access to emergency response services, you'll want a more robust system. DIY and professional brands offer home security bundles with most, if not all, of the equipment you'd need to get started and the ability to add single devices as needed.\nSmart home and AI\nMost home security devices are compatible with Alexa and Google Home smart hubs, but if you prefer Apple HomeKit or another smart home ecosystem, you may have to do a bit more shopping and comparing to find a system compatible with your existing smart home devices. Don't fret over compatibility too much as Matter is making it easier to connect previously non-compatible devices (although it hasn't quite come for security cameras yet).\nSmart home features are also always changing, especially with AI. Just in the past two years, SimpliSafe has added AI face and movement detection to help its monitoring agents, ADT has added support for Nest's familiar face AI recognition features and Arlo has increased services to include AI detection of fires, barking, screaming and more. You'll have to pay a lot more for these features and consider your own privacy if you're interested in the cutting-edge upgrades.\nInstallation\nKeep in mind all that equipment will need to be installed. While there isn't much to installing a security camera or even a wired video doorbell, whole-home systems can be a bit more demanding to install and set up. Some are DIY-friendly and use adhesive to position devices without leaving permanent marks but not all systems do this. If you'd rather leave that to an expert and have them walk you through how to use the system, a professional home security service may be the way to go.\nMonitoring and alerts\nVirtually all home security systems allow for self-monitoring, likely via an app on your phone. They'll also send you push notifications when there's an event, such as when a package is delivered to your doorstep. Basic sensors can send alerts about what specific sensor was triggered or tampered with, while adding a camera allows for more complex recognition. You can customize these alerts to get only the information you want (such as only when a person is detected), while most will automatically ignore things like vehicles.\nProfessional monitoring and emergency features\nConsider whether you want to be in charge of all the monitoring or if you'd like some support. Most systems allow you to add a professional monitoring plan, some even require it from the beginning. These services often cost more than $30 per month and sometimes much more if AI features are added.\nMore advanced features, such as facial recognition, glass break sensors and communication with emergency services may not be available from all manufacturers and devices. Consider the level of monitoring you want, and who you want to do it, along with the emergency response options, when choosing a home security system.\nExpandability\nMost home security systems allow you to buy single sensors or compatible devices and add them, one at a time, whenever you want to upgrade or address a specific problem. But they go about this in very different ways. Some only allow you to purchase its own brand devices, while others are compatible with a variety of third-party smart home devices. Some have very limited add-on options, while others have many choices. No matter what you decide, we recommend checking out the add-on options on a security system website to see what potential upgrades will look like.\n\" that you can tap on the company's keypad to arm and disarm your security system.\" image-credit=\"Kangaroo\" image-alt-text=\"Kangaroo keypad plus Roo key fob\" image-filename=\"houston-in-context-square.jpg\" image-target-url=\"\" image-credit-url=\"\" image-width=\"3355\" image-height=\"2543\" image-date-created=\"2021-07-01\" image-do-not-crop=\"true\" image-watermark=\"true\" ng-block=\"{\"id\":\"zrtb5n4nentp9ry\",\"type\":\"image\"}\" edition=\"us\">Initial costs\nWe listed \"cost\" last for a reason. A complete home security system will likely cost you at least a couple of hundred bucks, so be prepared for that. There's the potential to spend a lot more on equipment or a lot less. Also, keep in mind that the size of the system greatly affects the cost. Starter systems like many we listed here typically cost between $150 and $300, and allow you to add other compatible devices over time. Larger systems with 10 devices or more will cost at least several hundred dollars and can go up to $1,000 or more, depending on the tech that's included.\nOngoing costs\nOngoing costs can carry a bit more weight when choosing the best security system. Expect ongoing monthly fees from a professional service and possibly a contract to lock you into those fees for a year or two (although we favored picks without a required contract). Signing a contract may not be ideal, but it may also come with free equipment or installation and lower upfront costs.\nIf you're comfortable with self-monitoring, DIY systems may not come with any ongoing costs. Monthly subscriptions (without a contract) for cloud storage, enhanced features and possibly even professional monitoring are typically an option with DIY systems, often for lower monthly fees than professional services.\nPrivacy and security\nAlways look for a brand that's going to keep your data safe and has a good track record of security, encryption and protection against data breaches. That's not always easy -- many security companies have had issues in the past with breaches, privacy violations or even employees spying through home security cameras.\nWe look at a company's current practices, track record and how they've been improving in the past few years when making recommendations. SimpliSafe is consistently one of the standout performers in security, which is one reason they earned a top spot on our list. While Ring has had missteps in the past, it's improved in recent years and has even retracted its policy on providing police with video footage, so we feel comfortable recommending Ring at this time.\nHow we test home security systems\nHands-on testing is core to our evaluations of any home security products. In short, when it comes to the best home security systems, we pay special attention to the user experience, the promised features, reliability and overall value, along with a few other elements. We do the testing in a real home environment over at least a full week.\nInstallation process (and uninstallation)\nIn our tests we work with local professionals to get the professional installation experience, and tackle DIY installations ourselves. When a system offers both, we typically try to get some self-install products ourselves to experiment with along with the DIY installation. We look for ease of use, installation methods and how well sensors fit on sometimes-cramped doors or windows, among other factors.\nWe also look at how easy sensors are to uninstall. What if you want to move one, take one off for a while, or dismantle the whole system? So we check these factors, as well as disconnection options on the app.\nSensor performance\nThese tests include testing sensors at common access points, seeing how systems arm and disarm and finding out how voice controls and smart device integration work with the app. Along the way, we keep a careful eye on durability and design quality so we avoid recommending any shoddy products.\nAlerts, triggers and reliability\nOnce sensors are set up, we mess with them. We arm and disarm the system, test movement for motion sensors and see how easily access sensors pick up on vibration or tampering, depending on what they're rated to do. Along the way we watch for any issues with delayed sensor alerts and high latency, sensors that don't respond as they should and sensors that are over-responsive. When possible, we also take sensors for a little trip to make sure they work at acceptable distances (30 yards, etc.).\nApp experiences\nHome security system apps should be easy to use and fairly intuitive. This can be a struggle, because these apps tend to be particularly complicated and filled with new settings and features to learn. We run through all of them and see how effective it is to customize arm/disarm times, grace periods, new devices, geofencing, home routines and so much more. We test alert customized, disconnect options and how easy it is to shut down your service through the app, too.\nSmart home integrations\nIf home security systems work with third-party devices, we get some for testing and see how easy it is to set them up and tie third-party devices to routines. We watch for bugs and disconnect issues, which can be common in these situations.\nTo read more about our review process, check out our in-depth article on how we test home security systems and services.\nWhat's new in home security systems?\nThree trends in particular interest us in the latest home security developments:\nContinuing Matter support: As Matter and Thread continue to spread through the smart home, more and more security systems are adopting the new standards, which improve security and allow for more flexible control of systems. It\u2019s a slow process, partly because these brands have their own platforms for system management and partly because Matter has taken a long time to release protocols for key parts of home security like video cameras. But it\u2019s coming and Matter support is now something people should be looking for in home security systems.\nMore face recognition: From SimpliSafe to Google Nest and ADT\u2019s Trusted Neighbor, more security systems are adopting face recognition as a way to manage access. That means that users can add a profile of faces and let video doorbells or home cameras recognize faces and respond accordingly -- through customized alerts or by unlocking a smart lock for certain people. Privacy concerns remain about using face profiles, especially outside of your family members, but this technology is here to stay and expanding.\nNew integrations and new systems: Long-term brands have begun reviving their product lines with sleeker, faster products. ADT, for example, has released ADT+ with a new platform and product line, sporting more integrations with Google Nest devices than ever before. SimpliSafe has launched a new guard program that takes more advantage of human and face recognition when using professional monitoring. Brands that aren\u2019t launching new versions of their systems are in danger of falling behind the times.\nOther home security systems we've tested\nBesides the systems above, we've tested many of the top competitors. Here are the more recent options that didn't make our list.\nAbode Iota: Iota's all-in-one approach just wasn't as attractive to us as the whole security system. You may as well get an advanced security camera instead of this model.\nFrontpoint: Frontpoint's system is reliable, and its hardware is reasonably priced, but its $45 monthly monitoring fee is too expensive.\nKangaroo: Kangaroo is incredibly affordable but we found its video doorbell to be especially poor and the system design has started to feel very dated.\nCove: Cove Home Security, despite reasonable hardware prices, fell to an overly restrictive subscription model that doesn't allow for self-monitoring or app access without significant monthly fees.\nADT: ADT's older system, before ADT+, is inferior in nearly every way to the advances ADT+ and the latest system have made including self-install options, a superior app and somewhat more lucid pricing. We expect the older kits to be discontinued.\nRing Alarm Pro: The Pro version of Ring's sytem includes an Eero router, which is nice if you don't already have a Wi-Fi 6 router but most homes already have routers, and if you want to upgrade it's much smarter to get a standalone router that's exactly what you want rather than one that's bundled with a home security system.\nWyze Home Security System Sense v2: As for Wyze, we appreciate its excellent budget home security offerings, but we're holding off on recommending it at this time. Wyze has been struggling with frequent security vulnerabilities in recent years, a problem it doesn't seem to have under control. If we see signs that Wyze is making strides in privacy and security, we'll consider its newest systems for our list.\nHome security system FAQs\nDo I have to sign a contract for home security?\nWhat's the best home security camera system for your home?\nHow do I set up a home security system?\nWhat's the difference between a wired and wireless alarm system?\nCan I choose an all-in-one home security device instead of a whole system?\nWhich is better: SimpliSafe vs. Ring?\nDo home security systems work without Wi-Fi?\nCan I install a security system if I rent?\nRecent updates\nWinter 2024/2025 updates: After a very competent testing phase we added ADT+ as our new professional system suggestion, and gave Arlo's compact, all-in-one option a more prominent position because it can fit so many needs."

      "url": "https://www.cnet.com/home/security/going-on-vacation-high-tech-security-tips-before-you-leave/",
      "text": "If you have a vacation coming up, having your home security system dialed in to keep intruders at bay is ideal. The combination of the right security devices with key adjustments to the alarm system does a lot to protect your home when you're away. We consulted Batten home security expert Kirk MacDowell about vacation security tips for times like spring break. \"Try to make it look like someone is home. Have a neighbor grab your mail, water your plants and take out the trash while you're gone. Simple things like that can make a big difference,\" he said.\nThat's an excellent way to get started (if you have kind neighbors), but using smart tech effectively can make things even easier and give you more control. Here are our top recommendations.\nSet up Away or Vacation modes\nToday's smart home and home security settings don't just have Away modes, they also frequently have a Vacation mode. That's a routine you can set up to work while you're away for several days or more (if your home app doesn't have a vacation mode, you can tweak your Away or Eco mode, or set a whole new routine). Devices like Philips Hue lights and platforms like IFTTT make it easy to create full routines that cover multiple devices.\nVacation routines can switch smart lights on and off, indoors and out, to make it look like someone is still home. They can also operate other compatible devices, such as managing smart irrigation systems, arming smart cameras and more. Set a routine like this once, and you can use it over and over for trips.\nCheck the motion detection settings for your video doorbell\nVideo doorbells excel at keeping an eye on the action, and their algorithms are getting consistently better at detecting humans and other objects. Companies like Eufy are even working on motion detection that can identify suspicious behavior like dodging main pathways and can look for poor security.\nHowever, the motion detection that works best in your daily life isn't always the kind of detection that works when you're on vacation. We suggest visiting the doorbell and home camera apps to look at your motion detection settings. Consider steps like:\n- Turning up motion detection sensitivity\n- Set object detection to only humans to cut down on alerts\n- Set detection zones to close-up spots at your house and windows where people may try to get access\n- Turn up beeps or light indicators that show a camera is on and watching\n- Set notification to push to your phone screen instead of staying only within the app\n- Look for web app options, like Nest's support for online viewing and controls, which is ideal for overseas vacations\nAdditionally, if you pay for a subscription plan, check if it supports 24/7 emergency assistance contact so you can immediately call the police or fire department from an alert. It may be worth upgrading to that type of plan if you'll be gone for a month or two.\nFinally, Batten security expert Kirk MacDowell also mentioned checking that the lenses on all your home security cameras are clean. If it's been a long, dirty winter you should gently clean off video doorbells and cams so they have the clearest view when you're away.\nKeep your curtains open or automated\nTo keep your home looking lived in, it's a good idea to have your curtains open during vacations (and it lets the sun in to keep things from getting musty). Or if you have smart curtains or smart shades -- which are also available as a retrofit for existing curtains -- you can program them. Create a schedule for them to open during the day and close at night for best effect. Smart blinds like these don't have to be expensive: Even Ikea has an affordable version.\nManage remote entry with a smart lock\nSmart locks don't just let you know if you forget to lock the door. They also autolock for you under certain conditions and support a variety of scheduling options.\nMost useful smart locks, like the Aqara U100 or the Schlage Smart Lever, allow you to create passes or temporary codes to give to visitors. That lets you arrange checkups for pet sitters, plant waterers, helpful neighbors and others you might want to let inside, but only at certain times. Smart locks combine especially well with video doorbells -- just make sure you're in an area with a reliable Wi-Fi connection to use them remotely.\nAdjust your heating and cooling\nSmart thermostats from Nest, Ecobee and others also have Eco and Away modes you can use to set up separate vacation schedules. Ecobee also has a dedicated Vacation mode in its thermostat settings you can use just for this.\nThe best temperature range varies by season but should be less than you schedule while you're home. For summer, that would mean setting the thermostat 5 to 10 degrees higher in the day, but with a hard cap around 80 to 85 degrees to protect indoor plants and so on. For winter, aim for the reverse with a hard cap around 50 degrees for the daytime.\nThat temperature calculus changes if you have pets in a hot climate. You'll want to keep the home more comfortable by limiting the temperature ranges somewhere in the mid to upper 70s for cooling and around 60 for heating.\nSet up a \"listening\" service like Alexa Emergency Assist\nListening features use simple algorithms to identify \"uh-oh\" noises like breaking glass, smoke detector alarms and even dogs barking loudly. Home security systems like Abode or Ring offer listening options, but you don't always need a home security device to enable it.\nAmazon's Alexa smart speakers and smart displays, for example, have the Alexa Emergency Assist service, the successor to Alexa Guard. It costs around $6 monthly, and gives you access to sound detection as well as 24/7 emergency response services and emergency contacts for family. That's a nice deal to enable for a few months if you're going on plenty of vacations for a season, and the two-way audio on all Alexa speakers means you can talk through them live whenever you want.\nKeep watch with an armed security system\nIf your home doesn't have a whole house security system that can monitor multiple access points like windows and doors, this is a fine time to consider one. Today's home security systems don't need professional installation, or even a monthly subscription, to guard your home -- and many work with third-party smart devices, too.\nTake a look at our guides on the best DIY home security systems, the best cheap security systems and the best systems overall for your home to learn a whole lot more about your choices.\nAdd a leak detector to vulnerable home spots\nA leak detector is a clever little device with an open circuit lying against the floor. When water completes that circuit, it sets off all sorts of alarm bells and app notifications letting you know there's a leak present. That makes them valuable when you're away from home for extended periods of time. Stick them by the toilet, under the kitchen sink, next to the water heater or under pipes that may be in danger of freezing during a winter vacation.\nLeak detectors are available as an add-on for most home security systems, but you can also find standalone versions like Eufy's $35 model (requires a HomeBase) or the Alexa-compatible Kidde Leak Detector starting at $45. We suggest these models because they work with apps, which is important when you'll be away from home entirely.\nTell your home monitoring center you'll be gone\nIf you do splurge for professional home monitoring, look up their website and find a contact email or phone number to let them know that you'll be on vacation. Many home monitoring centers will adjust their official responses when they know that everyone is going to be away from home.\nGive your mail service a call (optional)\nCalling the post office used to be a go-to step when leaving for vacation. And if your vacay is going to be longer than a week or so, we still highly recommend messaging your local mail service and requesting to hold your mail. It's really easy to do and you can complete the steps online in a couple of minutes.\nHowever, we aren't getting as much mail these days as we once did, and it's harder than ever for strangers to notice when someone's mail is piling up. If you're only going to be gone for several business days or say, you can probably skip this step safely.\nStay cautious about what you post online\nWe know it's tempting to post about your vacation plans on social media, but this can also be an invitation for burglars or trespassers to make a visit. Unfortunately, it's difficult to know and trust everyone on your friends list, or friends of their friends who may see status updates as well.\nTo stay safe, avoid posting info and pics about your trips until they are finished. Then you can cut loose and unleash all those perfect shots on Instagram, TikTok, or Facebook.\nBonus tip: If you're renting, look at your lease\nSome leases require tenants to let landlords know if they'll be going on vacation for a certain amount of time, like longer than a week. Others don't mention it at all. Check your lease for details. Even if you don't have to alert anyone, you may find additional requests like shutting off water mains, setting the temperature to a certain level, arranging pet sitter access and so on.\nFinally, now is the perfect time to stop by our guide on how to deter burglars from every trying your house in the first place, information on if thieves are actually using Wi-Fi jammers on smart homes, and the all-around security cheat sheet for setting up different parts of home security."

      "text": "Center for Problem-Oriented Policing\nThe Problem of Burglary of Single-Family Houses\nThis guide addresses the problem of burglary of single-family houses. It begins by describing the problem and reviewing risk factors. It then identifies a series of questions to help you analyze your local problem. Finally, it reviews responses to the problem, and what is known about them from evaluative research and police practice.\nReported U.S. burglaries have dropped dramatically in recent years, declining 32 percent since 1990. This drop is variably attributed to a robust economy, increased use of security devices, and cocaine users' tendency to commit robbery rather than burglary.1 With an estimated 1.4 million residential burglaries in 1999, the total number of reported burglaries is at its lowest since 1966.2 However, many residential burglaries\u2014perhaps up to 50 percent\u2014go unreported.3 \u2020 Despite the large decline in reported burglaries, burglary remains the second most common serious crime in the United States (just behind larceny-theft), accounting for 18 percent of all serious crime. Burglary accounts for about 13 percent of all recorded crime in the United Kingdom.4\n\u2020 Burglaries with entry are more likely to be reported than are attempted burglaries. In Britain, about 75 percent of burglaries with entry are reported, compared with 45 percent of attempted burglaries (Budd 1999). Burglaries are also less likely to be reported when there is no loss, or relatively minor loss (Shover 1991). Kershaw et al(2001) [PDF] found that 75 percent of burglaries with loss were reported in Britain, while only 16 percent of burglaries with no loss were reported (Budd 1999).\nThe burglary clearance rate has remained consistently low, with an average of 14 percent in the United States and 23 percent in Britain. Rural agencies typically clear a slightly higher percentage of burglaries. The clearance rate for burglary is lower than that for any other serious offense. Indeed, most burglary investigations\u2014about 65 percent\u2014do not produce any information or evidence about the crime, making burglaries difficult to solve. Burglary causes substantial financial loss\u2014since most property is never recovered\u2014and serious psychological harm to the victims.5\nTo many, burglary is an intractable problem\u2014difficult to solve, and one in which the police role primarily entails recording the crime and consoling the victims.6 Although burglaries have declined in recent years, police strategies such as Neighborhood Watch and target-hardening have had limited success in reducing these crimes. However, some quite specific, highly focused burglary prevention efforts show promise.\nRelated Problems\nThis guide focuses on burglary of single-family houses\u2014primarily owner-occupied and detached. While there are many similarities between burglaries of these dwellings and those of multifamily homes, attached or semidetached houses, condominiums, and apartments (as well as other rental housing), the crime prevention techniques differ.\u2020 Single family detached houses are often attractive targets\u2014with greater rewards\u2014and more difficult to secure because they have multiple access points. Indeed, burglars are less likely to be seen entering larger houses that offer greater privacy. In general, greater accessibility to such houses presents opportunities to offenders.7\n\u2020 Research does not always clearly describe the housing types crime prevention projects cover, or it combines types. While this guide focuses on single-family houses, promising practices for all types of residential burglaries have been examined.\nIn contrast to residents of other types of housing, private homeowners may use their own initiative to protect their property\u2014and often have both the resources and incentive to do so. Residents of single-family houses do not depend on a landlord, who may have little financial incentive to secure a property. Most police offense reports include a premise code to help police distinguish single-family houses from other types of residences.\nAlthough burglaries of multifamily homes are the most numerous, some studies demonstrate that single-family houses are at higher risk.8 National burglary averages tend to mask the prevalence of burglaries of single-family houses in suburban areas, where such housing is more common. The proportion of burglaries of single-family houses will vary from one jurisdiction to another, based on the jurisdiction's housing types, overall burglary rates, neighborhood homogeneity\u2014especially economic homogeneity, proximity to offenders and other factors.\nOther problems related to burglary of single-family houses not addressed directly in this guide include:\n- Other types of residential burglaries, including those of apartments and other housing\n- Commercial burglaries\n- Drug markets and drug use\n- Other offenses related to single-family houses, including larceny and assault.\nFactors Contributing to Burglary of Single-Family Houses\nUnderstanding the factors that contribute to your problem will help you frame your own local analysis questions, determine good effectiveness measures, recognize key intervention points, and select appropriate responses.\nTimes When Burglaries Occur\nBurglary does not typically reflect large seasonal variations, although in the United States, burglary rates are the highest in August, and the lowest in February. Seasonal variations reflect local factors, including the weather and how it affects occupancy, particularly of vacation homes. In warm climates and seasons, residents may leave windows and doors open, providing easy access, while storm windows9 or double-pane glass10 to protect against harsh weather provides a deterrent to burglary. The length of the days, the availability of activities that take families away from home, and the temperature may all have some effect on burglary.\nIn the United States, most residential burglaries\u2014about 60 percent of reported offenses\u2014occur in the daytime, when houses are unoccupied.11 This proportion reflects a marked change in recent decades: in 1961, about 16 percent of residential burglaries occurred in the daytime; by 1995, the proportion of daytime burglaries had risen to 40 percent.12 This change is generally attributed to the increase in women working outside the home during those decades\u2014leaving houses vacant for much of the day. Thus, burglaries are often disproportionately concentrated on weekdays. The temporal pattern varies in Britain\u2014about 56 percent of burglaries occur when it is dark.13\nExactly when a burglary has occurred is often difficult for victims or police to determine. Usually, victims suggest a time range during which the offense occurred. Some researchers have divided burglary times into four distinct categories: morning (7 a.m. to 11 a.m.), afternoon (12 p.m. to 5 p.m.), evening (5 p.m. to 10 p.m.), and night (10 p.m. to 7 a.m.). This scheme naturally reflects residents' presence at various times,\u2020 as well as offender patterns. Some research suggests that burglars most often strike on weekdays, from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. and from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.14\u2014times when even routinely occupied houses may be empty.\n\u2020 Some police reports may record only the earliest possible time of occurrence, the midpoint of a time range, the time of the report, or the shift during which the offense occurred. These varied recordings will influence analysis of burglaries' distribution across time (Waller and Okihiro 1978).\nIn many cases, determining the times when burglaries occur helps in developing crime prevention strategies and in identifying potential suspects. For example, burglaries by juveniles during school hours may suggest truancy problems. After-school burglaries may be related to the availability of alternative activities.\nTarget Selection\nBurglars select targets based on a number of key factors, including the following:\u2020\n- Familiarity with the target, and convenience of the location\n- Occupancy\n- Visibility or surveillability\n- Accessibility\n- Vulnerability or security\n- Potential rewards.\n\u2020 These characteristics are also classified more generally as opportunity, risk, and rewards.\nThese elements interact. Visibility and accessibility are more important than vulnerability or security, which a burglar typically cannot assess from afar unless the resident has left the house visibly open.\nFamiliarity with the target, and convenience of the location. Offenders tend to commit crimes relatively close to where they live,15 although older, more professional burglars tend to be more mobile and travel farther.16 Burglars often target houses on routes from home to work, or on other routine travel routes. This tendency makes the following houses more vulnerable to burglary:\n- Houses near a ready pool of offenders. These include houses near large youth populations, drug addicts, shopping centers, sports arenas, transit stations , and urban high-crime areas.17\n- Houses near major thoroughfares. Heavy vehicle traffic that brings outsiders into an area may contribute to burglaries.18 Burglars become familiar with potential targets, and it is more difficult for residents to recognize strangers. Houses close to pedestrian paths are also more vulnerable to burglary.19\n- Houses on the outskirts of neighborhoods. Like houses near major thoroughfares, those on the outskirts of neighborhoods have greater exposure to strangers. Strangers are more likely to be noticed by residents of houses well within neighborhood confines, where less traffic makes their presence stand out. Such houses include those on dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs\u2014locations with few outlets.20\n- Houses previously burglarized. Such houses have a much higher risk of being burglarized than those never burglarized, partly because the factors that make them vulnerable once, such as occupancy or location, are difficult to change. Compared with non-burglarized houses, those previously targeted are up to four times more likely to be burglarized; any subsequent burglary is most likely to occur within six weeks of the initial crime.21 There are a variety of reasons suggested for revictimization: some houses offer cues of a good payoff or easy access; burglars return to houses for property left behind during the initial burglary; or burglars tell others about desirable houses.22 Burglars may also return to a target months later, to steal property the owners have presumably replaced through insurance proceeds.23 Numerous studies show that revictimization is most concentrated in lower-income areas, where burglaries are the most numerous.24\n- Houses near burglarized houses. Such houses face an increased risk of burglary after the neighbor is burglarized.25 Offenders may return to the area of a successful burglary and, if the previous target has been hardened, select another house, or they may seek similar property in a nearby house.\nOccupancy. Most burglars do not target occupied houses, taking great care to avoid them. Some studies suggest burglars routinely ring doorbells to confirm residents' absence. How long residents are away from home is a strong predictor of the risk of burglary,26 which explains why single-parent, one-person and younger-occupant homes are more vulnerable. The following houses are at higher risk:\n- Houses vacant for extended periods. Vacation or weekend homes, and those of residents away on vacation, are particularly at risk of burglary and revictimization.27 Signs of vacancy\u2014such as open garage doors or accumulated mail\u2014may indicate that no one is home.\n- Houses routinely vacant during the day. Houses that appear occupied\u2014with the lights on, a vehicle in the driveway, visible activity, or audible noises from within\u2014are less likely to be burglarized.28 Even houses near occupied houses generally have a lower risk of burglary.29\n- Houses of new residents. Neighborhoods with higher mobility\u2014those with shorter-term residents\u2014tend to have higher burglary rates, presumably because residents do not have well-established social networks.30\n- Houses without dogs. A dog's presence is a close substitute for human occupancy, and most burglars avoid houses with dogs. Small dogs may bark and attract attention, and large dogs may pose a physical threat, as well.31 On average, burglarized houses are less likely to have dogs than are non-burglarized houses, suggesting that dog ownership is a substantial deterrent.32 (Security alarms, discussed below, are also a substitute for occupancy.)\nVisibility or surveillability. The extent to which neighbors or passersby can see a house reflects its visibility or surveillability. A burglar's risk of being seen entering or leaving a property influences target selection, making the following houses more vulnerable to burglary:\n- Houses with cover. For prospective burglars, cover includes trees and dense shrubs\u2014especially evergreens\u2014near doors and windows; walls and fences, especially privacy fences; and architectural features such as latticed porches or garages which project from the front of houses, obscuring front doors. Entrances hidden by solid fencing or mature vegetation\u2014characteristic of many older homes are the entry point in the majority of burglaries of single-family houses.33\n- Houses that are secluded. Secluded houses are isolated from view by being set back from the road, sited on large lots or next to nonresidential land, such as parks.34 Seclusion reduces the chance that neighbors or passersby will see or hear a burglar.\n- Houses with poor lighting. For houses which are not secluded, poor lighting reduces a burglar's visibility to others. Steady lighting poses the threat that someone may be available to readily see the burglar, while motion-activated security lighting may serve as an alert in secluded areas. Lighting, of course, is not a factor in daytime burglaries, which are more common.\n- Houses on corners.35 Because burglars can often more easily assess corner-house occupancy, and corner houses typically have fewer immediate neighbors, they are more vulnerable to burglary. Burglars may inconspicuously scope out prospective targets while stopped at corner traffic lights or stop signs.36\n- Houses with concealing architectural designs. For privacy and aesthetics, some houses are designed and sited to be less visible to neighbors and passersby. Houses whose windows and doors face other houses appear to be less vulnerable to burglary.37\nAccessibility. Accessibility determines how easily a burglar can enter a house. Thus, the following houses are at greater risk of burglary:\n- Houses easily entered through side or back doors and windows.38 Side or back entries are the most common access point for burglars. In some areas, the front door is the most common break-in point, but this likely reflects architectural differences.39\n- Houses next to alleys. Alleys provide both access and escape for burglars, and limited visibility to neighbors. In addition, large side yards facilitate access to the backs of houses.\nVulnerability or security. How vulnerable or secure a house is determines how likely a burglar is to target it. The following houses are particularly at risk.\n- Houses with weakened entry points. Poor building materials can make houses more vulnerable to burglary. Older houses may have rusting, easily compromised locks or worn and decaying window and door frames, while newer houses may be built with cheap materials.\n- Houses whose residents are careless about security. Burglarized houses often have unlocked or open windows or doors.40 Seasonal variations may determine burglars' access methods\u2014summer months allow entry through open windows or doors, while winter months bring an increase in forced entry.41\n- Houses with few or no security devices. Studies show that alarms, combined with other security devices, reduce burglaries. Burglars are less likely to gain entry when a house has two or more security devices (including window locks, dead bolts, security lights, and alarms).42 Studies of offenders show that burglars may avoid houses with good locks, burglar bars or other security devices. By some accounts, burglars have already made the decision to burglarize a dwelling prior to encountering security features thus press ahead with the burglary. Experienced burglars may choose to tackle security devices,43 but the devices slow them down, making them more vulnerable to being seen.\nPotential rewards. In selecting targets, burglars consider the size and condition of a house and the type of cars in the driveway as indicators of the type and value of the house's contents.44 Thus, the following houses are vulnerable to burglary:\n- Houses displaying signs of wealth.45 Large and well-maintained houses with expensive vehicles are at risk of burglary. However, burglars avoid the most expensive houses, presumably because they assume those houses have more security or are more likely to be occupied.46\nGoods Stolen\nBurglars are most likely to steal cash and goods they can easily carry and sell, including jewelry, weapons, televisions, stereo equipment, and computers.47 They need transportation to move larger items, such as electronic equipment, while they often make off with cash and jewelry on foot.48\nFew burglars keep the goods they steal. A study in Britain showed that burglars typically disposed of stolen property within 24 hours, usually after stashing it in a semipublic location. They thus minimized their risk by moving goods only short distances.49 They appeared to have few concerns about being arrested for selling stolen property, reporting they safely sold goods to strangers and pawnbrokers.50\nBurglars tend to dispose of stolen goods through local pawnshops, taxi drivers and small-store owners.51 Few burglars use professional fences.52 Pawnshops\u2014often outlets for stolen goods\u2014have come under increasing scrutiny and regulation in many communities. Some burglars sell stolen goods on the street, occasionally trading them for drugs. Burglars commonly sell stolen goods in bars and gas stations;53 in bars, they usually sell the goods to staff, rather than customers.54 In many cases, burglars get little return for the goods.\nEntry Methods\nIn about two-thirds of reported U.S. burglaries (including commercial ones), the offenders force entry. Unsecured windows and doors (including sliding glass doors) are common entry points. Burglars typically use simple tools such as screwdrivers or crowbars to pry open weak locks, windows and doors,55 or they may simply break a window or kick in a door.\nIn about one-third of burglaries, the offenders do not force entry; they enter through unlocked or open windows and doors, especially basement windows and exterior and interior garage doors.56 There is no consensus about the most common entry point\u2014it depends on the house's architecture and siting on its lot.\nBurglars\nNational arrest data indicate that most burglars are male\u201487 percent of those arrested in 1999.57 Sixty-three percent were under 25. Whites accounted for 69 percent of burglary arrests, and blacks accounted for 29 percent.\nA lot of research has been conducted with burglars in the last decade, much of it to examine their decision-making, especially about target selection. Much of the research comes from interviews with offenders. Their willingness or ability to recall burglaries may influence the accuracy of the findings. Also, since police clear so few burglaries, there are likely major differences between successful burglars and those who get arrested. Successful burglars may be older or may differ in other important ways from those who get caught.\nBurglars can be quite prolific: one study found that offenders commonly committed at least two burglaries per week.58 Some studies suggest there is great variability in the number of burglaries offenders commit.59\nBurglars do not typically limit their offending to burglary; they participate in a wide range of property, violent and drug-related crime.60 Some burglars, however, appear to specialize in the crime for short periods.61 Burglars tend to be recidivists: once arrested and convicted, they have the highest rate of further arrests and convictions of all property offenders.62\nSome research suggests that most burglaries involve more than one offender.63 But there is considerable variability in co-offending. In one jurisdiction, 36 percent of burglars acted alone, while in another, 75 percent did. One study revealed that in about 45 percent of residential burglaries, offenders had a partner.64 Young offenders are probably more likely to have one.\nMost research categorizes burglars\u2014as novice, middle-range and professional, for example. Novices, the most common type, tend to be younger, make minimal gains from burglaries, burglarize nearby dwellings, and can be easily deterred by dogs, alarms or locks. Professionals tend to be older, carry out bigger burglary jobs, willing to take on security devices, and are more mobile, scouting good targets farther from home.\u2020 Middle-range burglars fall somewhere between the two, and more often work alone than do the others. A key feature distinguishing the types of burglars is their outlet for stolen goods. Professionals tend to have well-established outlets, while novices must seek out markets for goods.\n\u2020 Research suggests that the greater the financial loss due to a burglary, the less likely the police are to clear it (Poyner and Webb 1991 [PDF]), indicating that more skillful offenders commit the bigger burglaries.\nAlternatively, some researchers categorize offenders as either being opportunistic or engaging in detailed planning65\u2014a distinction useful for developing effective responses.\nResearch on burglars reveals the following characteristics:\n- Most burglars are motivated by the need\u2014sometimes desperate\u2014to get quick cash,66 often for drugs or alcohol. Some offenders, particularly younger ones, are motivated by the thrill of the offense.67 A small number of burglars are motivated by revenge against someone such as an ex-girlfriend or employer.\n- Studies suggest that drug and/or alcohol use and financial problems contribute to offending.68 Many burglars use their gains to finance partying, which may be characterized by frequent and heavy use of drugs and alcohol and a lack of regular employment.69\n- Drug abuse, particularly heroin abuse, has been closely associated with burglary.70 In fact, some suggest the decline in U.S. burglaries during the 1990s was at least partly due to the rise in cocaine users and to their tendency to commit robbery rather than burglary.71 Heroin and marijuana users are more likely to be cautious in carrying out break-ins, while cocaine users may take more risks.72\n- Burglars do not tend to think about the consequences of their actions, or they believe there is little chance of getting caught.73 Drug and alcohol abuse can impair their ability to assess consequences and risks.\n- Burglars often know their victims,74 who may include casual acquaintances, neighborhood residents, people for whom they have provided a service (such as moving or gardening), or friends or relatives of close friends. Thus, offenders have some knowledge of their victims, such as of their daily routine.75\nFree Bound Copies of the Problem Guides\nYou may order free bound copies in any of three ways:\nOnline: Department of Justice COPS Response Center\nEmail: [email protected]\nPhone: 800-421-6770 or 202-307-1480\nAllow several days for delivery.\nEmail sent.

      "text": "Personal details like your phone number and home address are meant to be kept secure. Unfortunately, thanks to data brokers, your home address is often only a Google search away -- we understand if that gives you the privacy ick. You are not alone; several Reddit users worry about their safety because of the same. People who have moved homes for safety issues or just don\u2019t want to give lots of junk mail probably don\u2019t want their address so easily scanned and updated.\nThe problem is that selling your address and especially when your address changes, can mean big bucks for everyone from your bank to the US Postal Service, which is how advertisers get their hands on your mailbox and fill it with junk. That also makes it easy for burglars to spoof an address as part of identity theft.\nFortunately, there are effective ways to remove your home address from the internet, and we've found them all. Here's what you need to do to keep this bit of personal info safe.\n1. Blur your current address on map apps\nThe street view features on map apps can be very helpful if you're a little lost, but they can also feel like a privacy irritation when anyone can type in your address and get a view of your home. That's why Google and others have provided ways to blur your home on street views and image capture so users can't get too good of a look.\nAs you'll find in our complete guide, you can visit Google Maps on your desktop computer and enter your address. Then just use the Report a Problem link and you can manually choose what parts of the street view to blur so you and your home are protected.\nApple Maps, with its Look Around tool, offers a similar privacy function, but you'll have to request it specifically. Send an email to mapsimagecollection@apple.com and provide it with your home address and a detailed description of your home in the Look Around feature. Apple will then blur it for your privacy.\n2. Report your address when you find it in search results\nGoogling your contact info is always a good idea if you're concerned about privacy. If you spot your address showing up in a Google Search result -- especially when Googling your name or other general information -- you can make a specific request to Google to remove it.\nTo do this, go to your Google Account, where you can find the icon option to Manage Your Google Account. Then you can select Data & Privacy > History Settings > My Activity. Choose Other Activity in the left side menu, scroll all the way down until you find the Results About You section, and select Get Started.\nThis option allows you to create an alert whenever Google notices your address in a search. From the alert section of the Results About You menu, you can request to have that information scrubbed from the internet with the Remove Result option. Google won't always do this: It will leave up addresses found on government sites, news pieces and some businesses, but it's a quick way to remove your address if it's popping up in annoying places.\n3. Hide your address on social media\nNow is the perfect time to check your social media accounts and see if your address is included in your profile information. You may have added it a long time ago without really thinking about it, but social profiles don't need your address -- or for that matter, pictures of your home and street. Visit your account information, the \"about you\" pages and other spots to ensure your address doesn't appear there.\n4. Check the Whitepages\nWhitepages (as opposed to the business-oriented Yellow Pages) is one of the largest collections of home addresses online and often the first stop for someone trying to look up a specific address. The good news is that while your address is probably in Whitepages, getting it removed takes only a few seconds. Just visit the Whitepages Suppression Request webpage and paste in the URL of your Whitepages profile, then request that it be removed.\n5. Remove accounts or request your address be removed\nChances are good you input your home address when signing up for a variety of websites and services. Some of those accounts are important -- you probably want Amazon to keep your home address if you get a lot of shipments, for example. But others are unnecessary, especially if you don't use that account much anymore.\nIn these cases, we recommend deleting your account or contacting customer service and requesting that your profile be removed. You can also sift through your promotion emails to get some reminders of the services you may have signed up for with your address. Common targets for cleaning up include:\n- Shopping website logins\n- Old apps you no longer use\n- Political organizations\n- Nonprofits and religious organizations\n- Old subscription services for goods or online content\n- Sports website profiles\n- Contest websites\n6. Invest in a post office box for deliveries\nIf you've never signed up for a post office box, you may be surprised how easy it is. You can apply online at USPS, pick from five different sizes of local boxes and get a box number for your local post office. Prices vary by size and location, but they tend to cost around $30 for a box large enough to get packages in, down to around $15 for an envelope box. A post office box also allows you to save a signature for important delivery and a few other tricks.\nWhen you have a post office box, you can substitute it for nearly any account that wants a shipping address, keeping your home address info offline and out of the hands of advertisers. If you're willing to pay, it's one of the most effective privacy options.\nSome people also prefer to give out the address of a local third-party shipping store so that packages can be delivered to and picked up there. This may work, but it's important that you contact your local shipping store and ask if it allows it, or it could create a delay fiasco.\n7. Set up a virtual mailbox (no, not your email)\nVirtual mailbox services are common for some businesses, frequent travelers and those highly protective of their address. A virtual mailbox receives your mail, tosses the junk and scans the important pieces of mail, then forwards them to your account so you can view them online wherever you are.\nVirtual mailboxes typically cost around $10 to $20 per month. You'll need to find a virtual mailbox company that offers services in your area and jump through a few legal hoops to authorize it to handle your mail -- steps the service should walk you through. Common options include Anytime Mailbox, PostScan Mail, PhysicalAddress.com, LegalZoom Virtual Mail (previously Earth Class) and IPostal1.\n8. Avoid using smart home location settings\nA number of smart home devices, including powerful security cameras and doorbells, will ask for or require your home address. They do this to enable more advanced mapping features, settings like Ring's Bird's Eye view, weather reports, climate information and other capabilities. However, if you want to protect your home address from outside eyes and potential sales, try to avoid smart home technology that requires a location.\nYou can usually find alternatives to devices that want your address, such as local storage-only security cameras with simplified account setup. However, signing up for any kind of professional monitoring or subscription service may require address info: You may be able to get away with entering a post office box or similar alternative, but security systems will generally want your real address.\n9. Enable a VPN for extra protection\nInternet service providers don't just know your IP address, they can also find out your physical address or at least its proximity. If you'd like to keep that information to yourself, one of the best options is a VPN, or virtual private network.\nThese services encrypt all your online data and allow you to hide your location in many different ways. Some are free, but the best VPNs typically come with a monthly subscription that starts at just a few dollars. Take a look at our list of the best VPNs, or look up your browsers to see if they offer built-in VPN capabilities.\nBonus tip: Only give out your address when required\nThis step helps all the other tips work: Keep your home address protected by giving it out only when you absolutely have to. For most people, that includes opening a bank account, signing up to vote and other important life tasks.\nBut in many other cases you can provide an alternative address that doesn't give away the exact location of your home but still gives you the access and mail destination you need. You can provide this address when you want shipments or mail or when other organizations like a gym, health clinic or local sign-up sheet ask. Start this habit when you implement any address protection measures.\nWith your home address more private online, consider adding protection with the best cameras without subscriptions, tips on deterring burglars and the top home security mistakes we're all making."

      "text": "Summer 2025 is here, and while it may feel like you can relax in these warm months, you should consider tightening up your home security practices and fixing any big mistakes that stand out. After all, you can never be too careful. In fact, Kirk MacDowell, a home security expert from Batten, informed us here at CNET that this time of year is when most home safety mistakes tend to crop up: \u201cAs the weather gets nicer, people are out and about more -- kids are out of school, families are taking trips -- so homes can be more vulnerable,\u201d he said.\nMacDowell asserts that effectively using home security cameras and implementing solid safety practices are essential for improving security. However, it is important to start by identifying the riskiest behaviors that homeowners and renters alike should avoid. Read on to find out more about the significant vulnerabilities that both experts and burglars clearly recognize.\nAnd if you're looking for even more security advice, check out our guide on safety tips for apartment dwellers and how to prevent home security cameras from being hacked.\n1. Failing to lock windows or doors\nThis is going to sound obvious but one of the worst things you can do when maintaining your home security is to leave windows or doors unlocked. You might assume that a robber or burglar is going to be willing to brute-force their way into your home but they're often looking for the lowest effort and lowest impact when breaking in because they don't want to draw attention to themselves. Nothing makes that easier than leaving the door unlocked and allowing them to waltz right in.\nOne way to prevent this is by placing a security camera outside your front door to create a sense that someone is watching. Another option is to invest in a sensor system that can tell if a door or window is opened. Internet-connected locks may even allow you to lock the door from anywhere and some systems will alert you when a lock has been left unlocked so you can address it.\n2. Hiding keys in common places\nKeeping a spare key outside in case you forget your keys, or if one of your friends or relatives needs to get in, is convenient. It's also convenient for other parties who may want to enter your home without permission. Placing a key in a common location can result in a burglar entering your home without any interference -- even when someone else is home, meaning it may put someone inside in danger.\nInstead of placing a key in a place where anyone looking can find it, consider more secure options. Put your key in a lock box that requires a code for access. Use a lock with a keypad that requires a PIN. Smart locks can also allow for remote unlock so you can allow someone into your home even when you aren't there. You can also create digital passes for other people to make management easier.\n3. Not maintaining your tech\nSmart home technology has brought us security cameras, smart locks and alarms. But technology also introduces a number of potential points of failure for your security system -- and ones that you might not consider if you assume that the technology \"just works.\"\nConsider how your smart home security devices operate. Do they plug in for power or do they use a battery? Check your plugged-in devices after any power outage to make sure they're working and check battery-powered devices regularly to make sure they're functioning as expected. \"Check that your cameras are recording and that the lenses are clean,\" MacDowell told me, \"Just like you winterize your home, think about \u2018summerizing\u2019 it too -- especially if you\u2019ll be away more often.\"\nAlso, make sure to keep the software up to date. Failing to do so can render your technology faulty or inoperable and can leave you open to cybersecurity attacks.\n4. Keeping the yard dark at night\nA dark yard may feel private and keep the light away from your windows but it can also be an invitation to skulk around. It makes it easier for trespassers to peek into your windows and see what goodies are inside your home. Enhancing your yard's lighting at night is a more effective alternative for home security.\nThis is why we have a complete list of the best home security cameras with lights. These lights work with motion detection and object recognition so they will only light up if they see a person, saving your eyeballs during the dark hours.\n5. Letting your bushes and trees get wild\nBushes, shrubs or trees look great, help with curb appeal and provide shade during hot days. But if you let them grow too high or wild, they can get in the way of your smart cameras and even provide cover for trespassers trying to get inside your home. Watch for plants that are:\n- Obscuring your windows\n- Blocking lines of sight for security cameras\n- Growing against your walls or roof (this is also a fire hazard)\nIf you notice these problems, it's time to plan a trimming project or consider taking these obstructive plants out and putting in some newer landscaping instead.\n6. Being casual with packaging\nOne common way that thieves look for potential break-in opportunities is watching what people put in their trash. If they see lots of boxes, especially big boxes for electronics, TVs and so on, they know a house has valuable, new items. Nip these signs in the bud by always cutting up your big boxes when disposing of them. Avoid any obvious outdoor clues that you recently made a big purchase.\n7. Talking about all your home activity on social media\nWe understand the urge to share fun news with friends but one of the most common home security mistakes we see now is people oversharing on social media. You don't always know who's looking at your posts, especially if you have a lot of followers with tenuous contact to your personal life. Those pics and posts about your new game console or current trip to the seaside could be an invitation for burglars or others with ill intent.\nMitigate your risks by culling your followers of any strangers and keeping trip plans off social media until you're back home. Try not to boast too much about big new purchases, especially if you don't know who'll be seeing them.\nSince you're already considering home security, learn about using an old smartphone as a security camera and the most effective places around the house to put security cameras. Plus, learn how to deter porch pirates."

      "text": "Spending time alone in your home comes with perks, from setting whatever temperature you like to blasting your favorite song. But living solo is also scary if you're worried about break-ins, trespassing or scams. When it comes to home security, a bit of prep goes a long way.\nI've kept watch for home security technology and smart home tricks that are especially useful when no one else is around. New locks, well-placed motion detectors, the right kind of smart lights and other devices can help you feel safer and give you info about what's happening around your house or apartment. Here's what I recommend.\nRead more: Essential Security Tips When Staying at an Airbnb or Rental\n1. Install a motion sensor or tinkly bell\nOne of the best safety measures to take when living alone is to know when someone else is around. A traditional option is attaching a string of bells to your door handle, but we have more dependable choices these days like this $12 light-up LED motion sensor.\nIf you prefer an outdoor alert or a motion sensor that can cover a long hallway/open floor plan, then you can choose this $35 weather-resistant sensor and hub with an adjustable chime instead.\nThis tip works especially well for those living alone because detectors old or new can be easily triggered by kids or partners, creating more confusion than confidence. You'll want to put them at locations and heights pets can't reach or activate too.\n2. Grab a portable door lock to give a room extra protection\nPortable locks can give any traditional, non-deadbolt door an extra lock that's harder to force through, for people truly worried about a violent breakin. You can easily put them on bedroom doors, rental doors or any other door where you want more defense \u2013 no matter what other security the house has. It's a useful, versatile solution if you're not sure how long you'll be living alone and you want something extra for a specific room.\nPortable locks are affordable too. Here's a two-pack for only $16. And if you want a more substantial upgrade, you can always choose a smart lock with app controls.\n3. Pick a portable cam you can move wherever you need\nA security cam can be a welcome eye on your home if you're living alone, but our experts recommend a portable, wireless indoor model in this case. You can move a portable cam to watch over whatever room you want or any particular hallway, corner or shadow that's giving you the creeps.\nOur favorite cams for these purposes include the Google Nest indoor/outdoor camera ($176) and the Ring Stick Up Cam Battery ($80). Both these cams can work outside as well if you're worried about a dark yard.\n4. Equip the main door with a video doorbell\nA video doorbell alerts you when someone is approaching, allows you to talk with a visitor remotely and can even sound sirens or speak up with automated messages. It's an all-in-one security device that's especially useful if you're home alone, and we have a full guide on the best models for your door. If you're keeping an eye on your wallet, we can also recommend several excellent cheap video doorbells.\nKeep in mind, most doorbells require a subscription or microSD card to store video footage. Some even allow you to set the doorbell to recognize familiar faces and warn about an unfamiliar face, which users may prefer.\n5. Set your indoor/outdoor lights to turn on at night\nMost random trespassers or burglars don't know you're home alone. You can make the illusion even more convincing with smart lighting that turns on at scheduled times to make it look like more people are arriving home and active in multiple rooms. It's a lot more effective than trying to mimic a flashing TV or other old-fashioned tactics.\nSmart bulbs are more affordable than ever, with options like this Amazon Basics 4-pack available for $36. They're made to fit into standard home sockets, and many no longer require hubs to work so they're very flexible. Set and forget a \"turn on\" schedule to keep your home looking busy no matter what's happening. And take a look at my picks for the best LED floodlights for larger options.\n6. Change the passwords for your device and lock logins\nPeople living alone, especially women, are far more likely to be attacked by someone they know when they are at home. So I recommend that when your living situation changes, you should prioritize changing the passwords on your security apps, Wi-Fi routers, security cameras and even your phone. Don't forget to change codes for your locks and garage door, if necessary. This is a basic security step that's all-too-easy to forget when you're getting used to living alone.\nRead more: We Asked a Criminologist About The Most Common Ways Burglars Break In\n7. Choose a high-quality keychain pepper spray\nYou never want to be in a situation where you feel physically threatened by someone, but if it happens it's great to have a little can of Mace or pepper spray close by. This Sabre spray is available for $10 and attaches to your keychain so you always have it nearby. You could even loop it to some phone cases, purses or belts. It has a quick detach clasp for easy access, plus a twist lock for safety.\nSet up a voice assistant emergency service\nMany voice assistants can call 911 for you or perform other tasks if you're not near your phone. But some go further. One of the best current examples is Alexa Emergency Assist, which can store your health information and emergency contact, put you in touch with an urgent response agent, and give you notifications about fire alarms or breaking glass when you aren't at home. The service starts at $6 per month. Other home security monitoring can offer similar services, but Alexa Emergency Assist is one of the more affordable options if you already have an Echo speaker.\nBonus tip: Invest in a panic button\nIf you want to go the extra mile for solo safety, you pick up a panic button that you can carry with you or set nearby to immediately contact responders whenever you need to. These panic buttons are a common part of home security systems. Ring Alarm offers one for $30, while SimpliSafe has a wall-mounted $20 model. Systems like ADT Plus combine panic buttons with their access fobs, and you can even find standalone models from brands like Silent Beacon.\nThese devices take a subscription to work properly and aren't for every wallet, but they do complete your home security when no one else is around (or home safety for a loved one in a similar situation).\nFor more spot-on security tips, check out if you can use a security cam in an apartment building, how to deter burglars from your home, if a dog is good for home security and the worst places to put a security camera."

DIY home security setups are often more affordable, customizable and compatible with other smart home devices, but you'll likely have to do the installing, setup and constant monitoring yourself. A professional home security service, though it's typically a bit more expensive and may require a monthly subscription, can save you the trouble of installing and setting up your equipment and help suggest the best devices to get.

Some cameras have the ability to pan and tilt and can track motion. Others are built to withstand the rain, wind and temperature extremes of being outdoors. Almost all have motion detection, object recognition and two-way audio. If placing a camera outdoors, keep in mind that some cameras have a wired power source, so you may have to run an extension cord to plug it in.

Corners are often the best spot for indoor cameras as they'll give you a wider view of the room, but if your camera has 360-degree panning, a central location may be best. As for outdoor cameras, try to install it 10 feet or so above the ground and in a spot where it won't take consistent exposure to direct sunlight or rain. Also, avoid installing any camera in a position that may compromise your neighbor's privacy. Video doorbells, meanwhile, should be installed about four feet up from the bottom of the doorframe.\n- Here's Where to Put Your Home Security Cameras\n- Never Put Home Security Cameras in These Spots\n- Can You Legally Record Audio or Video In Your Home?

However, your home security system isn't going to get hacked. Cybercriminals don't go around trying to hack doorbells or smart locks. They don't have the tools, the know-how or the time. Instead, home security can be \"hacked\" by people who already have the login information, like a jealous ex or a divorced spouse. That's why it's always a good idea to stay on top of your password management.\nThe closest we've seen to home hacking is the use of security system jammers, but there are barely any reports of criminals actually using these devices and if they do, they usually have first-hand knowledge about the security system beforehand. Most burglars are simply going to test for unlocked doors and maybe smash a window if they're desperate.\n- Is Smart Home Security Easily Hacked?

      "text": "Thieves are expanding the methods they use to burgle,with a new technique sweeping across America in recent years. The technique, however, is deeply ironic: It's using security cameras to watch us and our homes. Though fear not, it isn't by hacking into your own security devices and spying, but installing their own, often hidden in plain sight, in wealthier neighborhoods. I've seen it happen everywhere from Los Angeles to Phoenix and Boston. And it shows little sign of ending anytime soon.\nThese robberies have led to an official warning from the FBI. It also has people scared, and rumors and fearmongering have reached an all-time high. That's why I'm clearing up exactly what's going on here, who seems to be responsible and how you can protect your home in the future.\nRead more: The Latest Reports Show More Smart Device Hacking, But Your Home Is Probably Safe\nIs this really a new wave of high-tech 'crime tourist' burglars?\nSort of, but it's not as extravagant as some news stories would have people believe. Traditional burglars are adopting new surveillance techniques, thanks to wireless cam technology.\nSome news and police organizations have started calling these thieves \"crime tourists\" because they believe the techniques began with tourists from countries that allow short-term vacation visas or visa-less passes -- particularly from South America -- using these vacations to pick out and burgle houses. Certain robbers were tracked back to Chile, Peru, Colombia and nearby countries that share these programs with the US.\nHowever, these techniques aren't owned by any particular group (the UK and Australia have seen similar problems), and not all claims made in the media about these acts have been confirmed. Some people also use the term \"South American Theft Groups,\" which we stress aren't self-identified gangs, or limited to South America -- rather, this is a phrase police organizations coined when trying to track down sponsorship for certain crimes.\nBut the new thieves using hidden spy cameras do share a number of common tactics. Those include:\n- Searching for affluent neighborhoods or specific homes that look like they contain lots of valuables.\n- Looking for homes where it's easy to hide things or people in nearby bushes, trees or shrubs.\n- Monitoring these homes for several days to track people's movements.\n- Seeing what homes get regular, unattended packages ripe for piracy.\n- Camouflaging spy cams with leaves and green cases to hide them in trees or bushes.\n- Quickly breaking into homes during the day to steal jewelry, cash and expensive accessories while everyone is gone.\n- Avoiding the purchase/use of firearms or illegal activities that could draw attention.\n- Having contacts who can swiftly bail out the thieves if they're arrested.\nWait, why are the burglars hiding their own security cameras in the first place?\nIt's all about learning your schedule. Most burglaries happen in the middle of the day, when no one's home. But it's harder than ever to count on that, so these advanced thieves use battery-powered security cameras and apps to quickly view a full day's activity outside of a home, noting when people leave and return.\nWith this information, burglars can create a plan to quickly break into a house when everyone is gone and get out before anyone realizes they were there. They can also note when neighbors leave or arrive, to cut down on other risks. A couple of weekdays of monitoring, and a burglary can become much more efficient.\nAre police working to stop these crimes?\nDifferent police departments have different responses, but with agencies like the FBI involved, law enforcement has had a measure of success in catching these criminals. For example, a surveillance project allowed detectives to capture a three-person crime ring (all citizens of the United States that time) in the Boston case mentioned above. Similar efforts have seen success in other cities. In other cases, homeowners have found the hidden cams themselves and reported them to police departments, but no one's been arrested so far.\nThe problem is that police don't always have the resources and time to arrange a surveillance project like Boston did. They definitely don't have the resources to check every suburban neighborhood for hidden cameras in the foliage. And if a burglary has already happened successfully, it's tough for cops to do much unless the burglars continue to hit homes in the same area.\nThat means homeowners are the first and often best line of defense against these patient, tech-savvy thieves.\nHow can I stop burglars who prep like this?\nIt's very hard for most people to adjust their routines or try to fool hidden burglar cams. But all the prep in the world won't do thieves much good against the right kinds of home security. Here's how to think about boosting your protection if you consider your home a likely target for these kinds of criminals.\n1. Deal with overgrown areas on your property\nAvoid leaving any overgrown shrubs or trees where thieves can hide their own cameras. Keep your bushes and other greenery well trimmed, well away from walls or fences and without blind spots. Consider removing ivy or any wall-growth plants. A well-tended yard is a poor place to put a camera.\nIf you've had recent burglaries in your area, consider taking a tour of the streetside trees and any large shrubs on the other side of the street to see if there's a camera hiding there.\n2. Use a security camera with lights and human detection\nAdvanced security cameras have two-way audio, human detection and programmable LED floodlights you can use to make any trespasser think twice, regardless of whether you're home. Even if thieves approach confidently during the day, a camera or video doorbell can still alert you to a person's presence, while the audio features allow you to immediately tap in from the app and ask what they're doing.\nRead more: Best Security Cameras With Lights\n3. Program smart light schedules\nVacation modes for smart lights simulate people being home, so burglars don't recognize houses as vacant. Similar smart light settings can make it seem that people are working from home during the day, or coming home from work, even if no one's there that early in the evening. Confuse burglars with these settings and they're much more likely to choose a different target.\n4. Arm a home security system with sirens\nThough tenacious thieves may ignore a home security system, systems armed with access sensors and loud sirens remain an excellent deterrent. These new burglaries depend on no one noticing the break-in. Sirens that can alert neighbors and passersby can help drive worried burglars away ASAP. The top home security systems have features and add-ons just for this, as do the best DIY systems.\nRead more: Experts on Whether Your Dog Can Actually Prevent Break-Ins\n5. Lock valuables in a durable safe\nAny small valuables left accessible are easy targets for these thieves, as are smaller safes that can be carried away. Keep small valuables in a high-quality home safe while you're away, and if it's a smaller smart safe, find one that can be bolted in place for added protection.\nFor more tips on improving your overall home security, take a look at our full home security cheat sheet and review the worst home security mistakes you can make."

      "text": "Posting a social media status update indicating you're on vacation is as good as leaving the front door of your home wide open, according to a new study showing how burglars use social networks to scope out potential targets.\nAmong 50 ex-burglars in the United Kingdom, 78 percent said thieves monitor Facebook, Twitter and Foursquare before they pinpoint a specific house to rob. The burglars, according to the Credit Sesame study, check people's status updates: if someone posts pictures on Facebook from a vacation they're currently on, or posts a message on Twitter saying they're away for the weekend, the crooks immediately know they've got a lock on a home to break into.\nOf course, you'd never actually leave your front door wide open if you went on vacation, but when it comes to sharing online, people don't seem to equate a Foursquare check-in or a vacation pic with the fact that they're potentially alerting robbers that they're not home.\n[Posting Your Location Is Asking for Trouble]\nCredit Sesame's study cited a MetLife Auto & Homes report that said 15 percent of Americans use social media to report that they've left the home, while 35 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 to 34 check in or tweet about their location.\nThe all-seeing eye of Google Street View gives burglars another piece of ammunition; 74 percent of the ex-thieves polled said crooks use Street View to scope out homes before they strike.\nUnlike the way they're often portrayed in the movies, burglars don't always work under the cover of darkness. Credit Sesame reported that in 2010, 38.1 percent of robberies occurred during the day, as opposed to 20.5 percent at night. The average value of stolen goods during a daytime break-in was $2,158.\nFortunately, there are ways to stay on your favorite social networks without immediately compromising the security of your home and your family's safety. On Facebook and Twitter, make sure you adjust your privacy settings to only allow your friends to see your content, don't add friends you don't know, don't announce in a status update or anywhere else that you will be heading out of town, and wait until you get back home to post pictures from your vacation.\nA few tips to divert crooks' attention from your home while you're gone: lock your doors and windows, make your home appear occupied, have a friend or neighbor collect your mail and newspapers so they don't pile up and put timers on lights and televisions so they turn on and off to mimic your normal home routine."

      "text": "Home security is important, but a fancy security system over $500 with a professional monitoring service that can reach up to $70 a month isn't in everyone's budget. In my years of reviewing the latest home security systems, I've come across five special systems that perform very well while costing a whole lot less.\nOur Picks\nHOME SECURITY DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $250 (save $50)\n- $400 (save $50)\n- $400 (save $100)\n- $94 (save $66)\nMany of my picks are DIY security systems that cut costs while still meeting your household\u2019s needs. Others are flexible models that can move with you, or systems that only need a couple of sensors to do a ton of work with less -- while sparing your budget by around $200 to $300.\nWhat is the best cheap home security system of 2025 overall?\nAfter testing more than a dozen security brands and all the sensors they offer, my top pick for affordable security is SimpliSafe's DIY kit, thanks to its user-friendly design and low upfront cost, plus SimpliSafe's useful add-ons if you ever want to expand the system. Starter kits are usually around $250 to $300 for a simple setup, which is laudable considering what you get in return.\nWe also chose other cheap systems well worth your time, from Arlo's all-in-one sensors for those who want to keep things simple to the high-tech features Ring provides. Take a look, learn more about security systems and find the best one for you.\nBest cheap home security systems of 2025\nPros\n- Variety of starter kits at or under $300 to help save\n- Easy to install and operate\n- Great add-ons within the SimpliSafe ecosystem\n- Professional monitoring options that can add live guards, AI face recognition and other tricks\nCons\n- Limited to no smart home integrations with third parties like Google, Alexa, Yale, etc.\n- Website is a bit confusing\n- Higher-priced than other budget picks\nWhy I like it:\nSimpliSafe is one of our favorite security kits for DIY installation, with easy-to-understand setup that\u2019s ideal for people who\u2019ve never had a home security system before. But its benefits don\u2019t stop there: The smaller home security kits are very affordable, with the eight-piece version available for only $240 and easily enough for the average house. The Foundation kit, starting at $200, is even cheaper if you only want a sensor or two.\nSimpliSafe makes it easy to build out systems with more sensors, leak detectors and cameras, but has very limited support for any other smart home brand. Subscriptions range from a basic self-monitoring package to a full professional monitoring with live guards and AI features that can ignore friends and family.\nFinally, watch for deals on holidays: SimpliSafe usually throws in a free security camera or other add-on frequently during these times.\nWho is this for:\nDIYers who want an effective starter system that they don't have to pay much for -- with monitoring options if they decide to upgrade.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who want more for around $200; buyers who hate comparing the details of different packages.\nPros\n- Low starter pricing at $200\n- Advanced extra features like remote arming and cellular backup with subscription\n- Included range extender\n- Easy to expand, especially with cams\nCons\n- Not everyone needs a Wi-Fi range extender, especially in small homes\n- Limited smart home integration with an Alexa focus, which isn't great for Google users\nWhy I like it:\nRing\u2019s second-gen Alarm security system is a small but mighty security kit that includes a contact sensor, motion detector and a range extender if your Wi-Fi can\u2019t quite reach the distant doors of your home. Ring\u2019s design is reliable and its app is serviceable. As an Amazon brand, you can also easily find extra accessories to add for expansions, although this $200 kit is ideal for saving money.\nAmazon\u2019s involvement also means that Ring Alarm doesn\u2019t have much compatibility outside of Alexa. The Ring Protect system has several important features, including the ability to arm or disarm the system remotely, so a subscription is recommended. Fortunately, a subscription also includes valuable AI detection and AI video search features if you add one of the many Ring cameras to your kit.\nWho is this for:\nFans of Alexa, people who want a quick setup with an eye on potential security cameras later on.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nFans of Google; people who want to avoid subscriptions at all costs.\nPros\n- All-in-one sensors for easy, versatile setup in any space\n- Arlo\u2019s high-quality app is intuitive and helps with setup\n- Subscription isn\u2019t necessary to get key features like alerts\nCons\n- May be too limited for extra-large homes\n- Requires investment in doorbells and fobs if you really want to extend its capabilities\nWhy I like it:\nArlo\u2019s system is made for people who groan at the idea of setting up a whole security system. This affordable bundle includes two all-in-one sensors. Want them to guard doorways or windows? No problem. Want them to check for leaks or temperature problems? They\u2019ll do it, and with a wireless, adhesive setup, too. They can also monitor sounds like alarms and sudden light changes, among other capabilities. Put them wherever you want, and add a few more if you don\u2019t mind bumping the price up to $300.\nArlo offers a compatible doorbell and fob if you want to expand, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly necessary. Few vital features are locked behind the subscription if you don\u2019t have an Arlo cam, so this is an ideal option for those who don\u2019t want to pay any subscription fees at all.\nWho is this for:\nPeople who only need a small security system and want to save maximum bucks; those who have a lot of sensor needs and want sensors they can enlist for all kinds of duties.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who want extra simple sensors that they don't want to think about too much; buyers looking for a larger system.\nPros\n- Excellent third-party support with many different brands including Sonos, Ecobee, Philips and more\n- Easy setup\n- Largely optional subscriptions\nCons\n- Cheap versions under $300 don\u2019t have many sensors\nWhy I like it:\nAbode gets plenty of points for its broad smart home compatibility, working with not only the big three voice assistants (Alexa, Google and Siri) but also with speaker brands like Sonos and Bose, light brands like Ecobee and Philips Hue, Z-Wave smart locks, Ecobee thermostats and more. If you already have smart home devices or think you'll want some in the future, Abode is an easy way to plan for compatibility at an affordable price.\nBut Abode\u2019s most affordable systems are limited in size. If you want to keep costs down, you\u2019ll be limited to one sensor most suitable for your front door or a similar area. That makes the cheap version more suitable for apartments or dorms, but a great option if you want to build out your security in the coming years.\nWho is this for:\nPeople who already have home security devices and want to integrate them with a cheap security system; Apple fans.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who want at least a few sensors in their starter kit instead of just one.\nPros\n- Extra affordable around $150 and extra compact\n- Sensors tie into a high-quality 2K wired camera that can detect motion and more\n- Aqara app is easy to use for basic functions, especially for fast setup\n- Reliable sensor performance\n- Apple Home compatibility\nCons\n- Too tiny for larger spaces and multiple doors\n- More complex settings can be difficult to figure out\nWhy I like it:\nAqara's little system is the smallest security kit I've tested, but it still manages to shine. The sensors, including a tiny motion detector, a vibration sensor and an open/shut access sensor, are all easy to set up and connect to the 2K camera hub (which includes a siren and two-way audio). You can get a variety of movement alerts and check on history easily with the Aqara app, or even set more complicated routines if you want to really dig into settings.\nThe system also has support for Google Home, Alexa and Apple Home. Perhaps best of all, it's incredibly cheap, starting at $165 but with occasional sales bringing it much lower. It's an ideal DIY security system for small spaces like entryways, offices, garages and other spots that need a watchful eye. A monitoring subscription is optional and not necessary to access most features.\nWho is this for:\nPeople who want to save as much as possible and only have a small space to watch over.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who want a larger system that's easier to expand into other areas or products\nCheap home security systems compared\nCheap home security systems compared\n| Best cheap home security systems | SimpliSafe Home Security | Ring Alarm 5-Piece Kit | Arlo Home Security System | Abode Iota Security Kit | Aqara Camera Protect Kit Y100 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| System price | $239 | $200 | $200 | $300 | $160 |\n| Monthly monitoring price | $15/month | $20/month | $25/month | 18 per month+ | N/A |\n| Starter equipment | 1 base station, 1 keypad, 1 panic button, 1 motion sensor, 4 entry sensors | Door/window sensors, motion detectors, a keypad, a siren and optional professional monitoring subscriptions | 1 keypad control panel, 2 All-in-One sensors | 1 base station + motion sensor, 1 mini door/window sensor, 1 key fob | 1 base camera hub, 1 motion sensor, 1 vibration sensor, 1 open/shut sensor |\n| Contract required? | No | No | No | No | No |\n| Installation | DIY | DIY | DIY | DIY | DIY |\n| Extra features/plans | Customizable system, built-in Wi-Fi and cellular, integration with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant | Cellular-powered backup Wi-Fi, network security monitoring, local processing, storage for all of your Ring devices | 24/7 emergency response, smart interactive notifications, cellular and battery backup, integration with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant | 24/7 emergency response, smart detect notifications, cellular and battery backup, integration with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and Apple Siri, broad smart home compatibility | Camera motion detection routines, integration with Google, Alexa and Apple |\n| Review score | 8.5/10 | 7.5/10 | 8.5/10 | 7.9/10 | Coming soon |\nOther home security systems we tested\nWe haven't listed every cheap security system here, since some, such as AT&T Digital Life, are no longer available. For the ones that are available, we made decisions about not including them, often based on extra prices.\n- Frontpoint: Although Frontpoint's hardware is solidly priced, its $50 monthly subscription fee is simply too much to recommend to anyone trying to stick to a budget.\n- Kangaroo: While Kangaroo is an incredibly wallet-friendly DIY security system, its value simply isn't as high as our top picks. Its hardware isn't just cheap on paper, it also feels cheap. Its doorbell camera is terrible.\n- Cove Home Security: While Cove's hardware is reasonably priced, the inability to self-monitor the system \u2014 or even have app access \u2014 without significant monthly fees makes it a less-than-ideal option for the budget-conscious buyer.\n- ADT: Professionally installed systems probably aren't the way to go for the best cheap home security system, and ADT is worse than others on the list simply for its astronomically high prices and forced contracts.\n- Vivint: Like ADT, Vivint isn't for the faint of wallet. While it's a great system for those interested in smart home integration, opting for Vivint won't save you money in the short term or long run.\nRead more: How to Turn Your Old iPhone or Android Into a Home Security Camera for Free\nHow we test home security systems\nThe CNET home security editors have tested out every major home security system over the years with dozens of brands and new upgrades reviewed. Hands-on testing is core to our evaluations of any home security products. We do the testing in a real home environment over at least a full week, often longer to test all kinds of security features.\nInstallation and setup\nSetup is especially important for security systems because there are so many parts and they need to be installed carefully to work. I generally favor adhesive mounts because they are easier to install in more places and can be taken off easily as well. As I explore mounting options, I also review setup instructions and account creation in the app to see how confusing it may be for newcomers.\nSetup time ranges depending on how big the system is. For these cheap starter kits, which are largely adhesive-based, newcomers should be able to set them up in a couple of hours, or sooner if they know exactly where they are going to place the sensors.\nApp use\nHome security apps can sometimes be complex or frustrating, especially for more in-depth home routines. I dig around in the app thoroughly as I test settings, controls, routines and general management, like options to extend disarming grace periods or turning down sensor sensitivity.\nSensors and alarm testing\nWith the system set up, it's time to test it out. From banging on glass to creeping in front of motion sensors and opening protected doors, I see how sensors perform, how quickly they respond, the types of alerts they send, and if they have accurate tampering warnings and more. Along the way I get a good test of the sirens and alarms, too.\nMonitoring, contracts and ease of use\nIt's also important to take time to review a company's monitoring options, fees, if they have contracts and generally how opaque their purchasing system is. Security companies can be very bad about this, which is why I prefer DIY options for those looking for cheap systems that make it very clear what you're getting and how much it costs.\nSince most of my systems come with a free trial, this is also the time I test out how well the extra features work, such as additional monitoring options.\nHome routines\nMany security systems enable home routines to set up automated arm/disarm options, customizable alerts, connections with cameras or locks and lots more. I test these functions, how well they work, and how reliably systems connect with supported apps like Alexa or Google Home (and if those connections drop over time).\nFactors to consider when buying a cheap home security system\nNot sure how to make up your mind? Here are the most important factors when considering a home security system that will spare your wallet.\nPricing and subscriptions\nSecurity systems can be opaque when it comes to final pricing. The listed cost is often replaced by constant, rotating discounts which are more representative of the actual cost, and total subscription fees may not be obvious.\nFor our list, we chose DIY companies with upfront pricing models so you can see what you get, aiming generally between $200 and $300. If you want to save as much as possible, watch subscriptions carefully to see what\u2019s included. Sometimes, you may be able to get away without a subscription at all, especially if you don\u2019t want any cameras. Other times, a basic self-monitoring plan may be required.\nApp controls\nApps should be easy to understand and avoid hiding important features behind complex menus or constant demands for subscription fees. Look for clean apps with helpful user interfaces, large touchscreen buttons and walkthroughs during your setup process.\nSetup and installation\nAvoiding professional installation is a great way to save money, so we chose systems that are DIY and don\u2019t have any contract requirements.\nInstallation also affects value, because smaller, cheaper kits work best when you use them well. That means choosing the most vulnerable doors and windows in your home with as few sensors as possible. You may want to check out our guide on how burglars choose homes to break into.\nFlexible arming and disarming\nLook for systems that have remote arming and disarming, customizable arming delays to get out the door and similar features. Automatic arming and disarming based on time of day, geofencing and other options are also handy.\nMovability\nAffordable security systems are great fits for rentals and apartments, but what happens when you have to move? We favored systems that use adhesive rather than leaving holes in the wall, and that are relatively easy to take down, pack up and install again during a move.\nAdditional features\nTake a look at add-ons if you ever want to expand your system. Look for a variety of sensor options, including motion sensors, video doorbells, fobs, smart locks, glass break/vibration sensors and more. These should be affordable and easy to add.\nSmart home compatibility\nIf you already use a voice assistant or standalone smart home devices, check to see if the home security system supports them before you buy. Google and Alexa are commonly supported, but other platforms less so, and home security systems can vary a lot. Matter compatibility is helping out here, but still has a long way to roll out.\nMonitoring options\nEven cheap home security systems offer professional monitoring services that can call the police or fire department for you, among other services. But they cost a monthly fee, which kind of defeats the purpose of finding a cheap home security system. If you want a monitoring plan to enable extra features and get professional eyes on your home, they typically cost between $20 to $30 a month for starter versions.\nWhat we updated\nSummer 2025: I tested and was impressed with Aqara's unique approach to security systems -- a camera that acts as a hub for several teeny-tiny security sensors. It's extra cheap and particularly easy to set up, making it a great fit for this list. I added it as an ultra-budget option, especially when it's on sale, but be warned it's not as easy to expand as some of our other picks so it works best in small spaces.\nFAQ\nIs it worth it to get a home security system?\nUltimately, you'll have to answer this question for yourself. Home security systems do deter burglars. Depending on where you live, a few hundred dollars may be a cost worth incurring to avoid the risk of burglaries or damaged property. Consider how frequent break-ins are in your area, how easy it is for strangers to access your home and how vulnerable the valuables in your home are.\nWhat is a good price for a home security system?\nHome security systems range in price anywhere from $100 to thousands of dollars. Generally, the larger the space you hope to cover -- especially the number of entryways you want to monitor -- the more expensive the system.\nMany affordable systems allow you to pick your devices a la carte, and most sensors shouldn't cost more than $30 apiece. If you're looking for reliable, budget-friendly picks, you shouldn't spend more than a few hundred dollars on home security. Likewise, you shouldn't be paying more than $25 or $30 at the most for cheap monthly monitoring unless you're using a professionally installed system.\nDo I always need a subscription for a home security system?\nNot necessarily, and it varies greatly depending on the brand. Always look at what home security systems lock behind a subscription fee. Sometimes, there will be advanced features you can live without, especially if you don\u2019t want to add a camera. In other cases, you\u2019ll need at least a self-monitoring subscription to unlike vital features like remote control.\nCan I take a home security system with me?\nIt\u2019s easier with some systems than others. If you move a lot or are planning a move, look for systems that use adhesive that\u2019s easy to remove and offer compact systems to bundle up. Most of the picks on our list meet the qualifications of an easy-to-move system.\nWhat if my new home already has a home security system?\nYou probably shouldn\u2019t use it -- at least not right away. It\u2019s time to ask some questions instead. It could be a landlord\u2019s, a system wiped and left behind by the previous owner or just a few unwanted devices. We have a full guide on what to do with it here."

      "text": "SALT LAKE CITY (KUTV) \u2014 Imagine returning from a week\u2019s vacation only to see a total stranger had taken over your home and had stolen most of your stuff.\nOne Utah family claims that\u2019s what happened to them after they found a squatter who had been living in their apartment for seven days, and the neighbors didn\u2019t seem to notice.\nGenesis Gonzalez and her one-year-old son had been visiting family for a week in Spanish Fork, but when she came back Thursday night, she saw something weird.\n\u201cI saw the hole,\u201d she said, referring to the doorknob that was cut out of her front door.\nShe could also smell cigarette smoke and heard that someone was watching her TV.\nWhen she opened the door, she said she saw a strange woman on her couch. That woman reportedly got up and started screaming at Gonzalez to leave, claiming the apartment was hers now.\n\u201cI had a diaper in my hand and she took the diaper and threw away the diaper and told me, \u2018Go away, this is my place. Take your child with you,'\u201d Gonzalez said.\nShe got herself out of there and called police.\nGonzalez said, \u201cI was crying because, obviously, I was so scared. I was like, \u2018This is my apartment. What is going on?\u2019\u201d\nShe also texted her husband, Jaime, who was coming home from Mexico.\n\u201cShe just texted me, saying, \u2018Someone broke into our home. A random lady is in our house. I just called the police.\u2019 I was shocked. I thought she was joking,\u201d he said.\nHowever, when he got home, he said he saw his apartment had been ransacked.\n\u201cAs soon as I walked in, I saw that everything was missing from its place,\" he said. \"The kitchen cabinets had been torn out and all the food was gone. When I walked into my closet, it was completely bare. I didn\u2019t see any clothes, at all.\u201d\nMORE from KUTV:\nGonzalez said the squatter even took baby clothes, their drinking glasses, and worst of all, Genesis\u2019 wedding ring, which she wasn\u2019t wearing because she was seven months pregnant.\nShe said, \u201cI feel so bad because that\u2019s important for me.\u201d\nCourt documents said the suspect had stayed in one of those apartments for a week, and the neighbors didn\u2019t seem to notice.\nSalt Lake City Police declined to do an interview about the case, but the probable cause statement said the suspect, Leslie Jean Harding, placed items near doors inside the complex, and if no one removed those items she knew nobody was home.\nHarding reportedly stayed at the apartment while police arrived, then admitted she had been staying there for a week.\nHarding was booked for criminal trespassing.\nThe family still has not gotten their belongings back.

      "text": "A group of more than a dozen states on Tuesday filed individual lawsuits against TikTok, charging that the wildly popular but controversial video app is deliberately set up to addict children and is harmful to their mental health.\nThe bipartisan coalition, led by the attorneys general for California and New York, includes a total of 13 states and the District of Columbia. The group alleges that TikTok violated state laws by falsely claiming its platform is safe for young people.\nThey charge that many of the video app's young users are struggling with poor mental health and body image issues due to the platform's addictive features and are getting injured or dying because of dangerous TikTok challenges that are created and promoted on the platform.\nThe lawsuits seek to stop those practices and impose financial penalties on the social media company.\n\"TikTok claims that their platform is safe for young people, but that is far from true,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement, pointing to the deaths of young people caused by TikTok challenges, and the mental-health problems suffered by others.\n\"Today, we are suing TikTok to protect young people and help combat the nationwide youth mental health crisis,\" she said. \"Kids and families across the country are desperate for help to address this crisis and we are doing everything in our power to protect them.\"\nTikTok released a statement saying that it strongly disagrees with the claims, adding that it believes many of them to be \"inaccurate and misleading.\"\nIt argued that it has worked hard to protect teens, saying it has voluntarily put in place \"robust safeguards\" and proactively removed suspected underage users.\n\"We've endeavored to work with the attorneys general for over two years, and it is incredibly disappointing they have taken this step rather than work with us on constructive solutions to industrywide challenges,\" TikTok said.\nThe group of suing states say that's not the case and that TikTok's efforts have been more about public relations than protecting kids. Like other social media apps, TikTok is designed to keep users endlessly scrolling, with an algorithm feeding each user exactly what they want to see.\nThe attorneys general also said the app's highlighted \"likes\" and comments section acts as a form of social validation, potentially affecting teens' self-esteem, along with the app's use of beauty filters that can alter a user's appearance and also potentially hurt their self-image.\nThey said the beauty filters have been especially harmful to young girls, who end up thinking they don't look good unless they use them to edit their features, which could put them at risk of body image issues, eating disorders, body dysmorphia and other health-related problems.\nThe lawsuits reflect a growing backlash against many social media companies in regard to how they market themselves to and treat their youngest users.\nLast year, a group of more than 30 states filed suit against Meta, the parent company of Facebook and WhatsApp, alleging that they're also designed to be addictive and are damaging to the mental health of kids. That case is still pending, but Meta has since rolled out sweeping safety updates designed to protect teens.\nTikTok is also dealing with a US Department of Justice lawsuit accusing it and its China-based parent company, ByteDance, of violating children's privacy laws. In the suit, the government says the app knowingly allowed children under 13 years old to make and use accounts without parental consent; collected \"extensive data\" from those children; and didn't delete the accounts and data even when parents asked for that.\nAnd TikTok still faces a US ban starting in January unless ByteDance sells it to a buyer deemed fit by US officials.\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle have said TikTok could be used by China's government to spy on Americans or otherwise threaten national security. TikTok has denied those allegations.\nSome free speech and digital rights groups also oppose the ban, saying that rather than singling out TikTok, what's really needed is a set of comprehensive digital privacy laws that would protect Americans' personal information. But if the government gets its way, it could require the removal of TikTok from US app stores.\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation, a prominent digital rights group, said in a statement that it's \"troubled\" by the lawsuits.\n\"The states' claims regarding features like autoplay and endless scrolling are really just a smokescreen for their distaste for First Amendment-protected content,\" Aaron Mackey, the EFF's free speech and transparency litigation director, said in a statement, adding that he doubts there would be lawsuits if TikTok showed endless streams of videos about math problems and classical literature.\n\"Parents and minors, not states, should decide when and how young people use TikTok,\" he said, also reiterating the need for strong data privacy legislation to protect all TikTok users."

Whether you want to stream region-restricted movies and shows while traveling, log into your online banking app from abroad without triggering a CAPTCHA or add an extra layer of protection on public Wi-Fi (such as at the airport terminal and your hotel), a VPN is essential for travel. The benefits of VPNs make them great to install before you embark on your journey.\nHere at CNET, we\u2019ve thoroughly assessed dozens of VPNs, running speed tests, checking for DNS leaks, streaming videos and comparing prices to analyze value. When rounding up the top travel VPNs, we primarily focused on each provider\u2019s server locations by number of countries and total options. We also considered privacy features, device compatibility and general performance. Whether you're on a summer vacation, galivanting across the globe on business or on a cross-country road trip, a virtual private network is a great addition to your app arsenal. Let\u2019s dive into the best VPNs for travel to keep you connected wherever you roam.\nFactors to consider in a VPN for travel\nThere\u2019s a lot to think about when selecting a VPN for travel. Leveraging our years of expertise in the VPN space coupled with what you\u2019ll need when traveling, here\u2019s what to look for:\nServer network\nSpecifically for travel, you\u2019ll want a large VPN server network. More overall connectivity options are beneficial, you\u2019ll also want plenty of countries if you plan on any international travel. Therefore, it's important to consider the total number of servers as well as the individual country count. For instance, some VPNs have thousands of servers sprinkled through only a few nations. At the high end, you'll find VPNs with servers in 100 or more countries, although I'd recommend picking a VPN with a presence in at least 50 international locations. Many servers in a smaller handful of countries might work if you only travel to one of those spots. For regular international adventures, greater country choice comes in handy.\nPrivacy\nVPNs add a layer of protection by encrypting your traffic and masking your IP address, making it harder for cyber attackers to access your browsing data. When traveling, you\u2019ll likely use open wireless networks at an airport terminal, in the hotel lobby or at a coffee shop, but a VPN protects your data from eavesdropping, whether by cyber criminals or snooping ISPs. Look for a strict no-logging policy, and AES 256-bit encryption (OpenVPN and IKEv2) or ChaCha20 (WireGuard or IKEv2) at a minimum.\nDevice compatibility\nYou\u2019ll want a VPN that runs on the gadgets you\u2019re bringing on your trip. Make a list of the devices you want to bring along with a VPN installed and ensure your provider has apps for those electronics. Luckily, most providers offer solid Windows, MacOS, Android and iPhone apps. Many offer Linux VPN apps, but only a few feature a graphical user interface, which is more beginner-friendly than a command-line interface. If you want to tote your Linux laptop or a Steam Deck along, look for a VPN with a Linux GUI app. Although most folks don\u2019t travel with streaming devices, you might tote along a Fire Stick, Android TV box or Apple TV for your hotel room.\nSpeed\nAll VPNs throttle your internet upload and download speeds somewhat, but the fastest options drop your connectivity by an average loss of only 10% to 25%. Especially if you\u2019re performing internet-intensive tasks like streaming video in 4K, Zooming for work, gaming or uploading YouTube videos, you\u2019ll want a fast VPN. Even if you aren\u2019t, reliable internet speeds are great for a better experience checking your email and browsing the web.\nStreaming support\nAside from privacy, many people use VPNs to unblock region-restricted content. For instance, you can use a VPN to watch BBC iPlayer -- normally available only in the UK -- from other countries, like the US, meaning you can stream shows like The Jetty. Similarly, a VPN is useful when traveling. If you\u2019re on vacation in a foreign country but want to access Netflix libraries from your home country to continue your binge-watching, a VPN makes that possible. Check which VPNs unblock the streaming services you want to watch from abroad.\nPrice\nVPNs range from about $13 a month to about $100 annually. Generally, you\u2019ll get a discount by paying for a year or more of service upfront, but we don\u2019t recommend shelling out for more than 12 months at a time. While the VPN you pick might initially be fast, secure and excellent for streaming, it could get acquired by a shady company, suffer a data breach or get slower during a year. We suggest sticking to an annual plan for the best value and the least risk.\nWhy you should use a VPN for travel\nA VPN makes a great travel companion thanks to its privacy features and geographic unblocking. Because a VPN encrypts your internet traffic, it protects your data to a degree from others on a public Wi-Fi network seeking unencrypted data. Websites you visit don\u2019t see your actual IP address and instead view an IP given to you by your VPN software, making it harder to view personal information such as your physical location or online activity. You\u2019re still susceptible to malware, viruses and phishing attacks, so keep in mind that a VPN isn\u2019t an antivirus software replacement. You can find antivirus software bundled with some VPNs and vice versa.\nVPNs can also spoof apps and internet-connected services like websites into thinking you\u2019re located in a different region. For example, you might be on holiday in the UK but want to access your Gmail without triggering a security login. Or perhaps you\u2019d like to stream a movie that is only available on US Netflix while in Canada. Using a VPN, you can make it appear like you\u2019re in a different city or even country. Whether for entertainment purposes or bypassing CAPTCHAs, VPNs can circumvent location restrictions.\nFor more geographically specific VPN information, check out our guides to the best VPNs for Canada, Mexico, Australia and Japan.\nHow we test VPNs for travel\nI couldn\u2019t use this article as an excuse to travel extensively but I have country-hopped regularly, with notable stints in the UK, Peru and Sierra Leone. On a trip to Rome in 2019, I downloaded a VPN on my laptop and Android phone before leaving so I could stream Netflix from the hotel and access my Gmail without triggering a security alert (at the time, I was using VPN Unlimited, although I\u2019ve since switched to NordVPN). To select the best VPNs for travel, we rigorously assessed dozens of providers by running speed tests, checking for DNS leaks, poring over terms of service, using apps and streaming videos. We researched VPN provider server networks, factoring in the overall number and country locations, which dictate whether a virtual private network is suitable for globe-trotting.\nOther VPNs we tested\nPIA\nPrivate Internet Access brings a lot to the table, particularly for regular travelers. Its large server network blankets the globe with 35,000 servers in 91 countries. ExpressVPN and Surfshark deliver more individual country choices but PIA\u2019s sheer number of servers lets you easily find an optimal connection. It\u2019s an especially great VPN for folks traveling domestically or to one of the worldwide locales where Private Internet Access maintains a decent presence. In our experience, we found PIA unblocked Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus and Netflix on US and UK servers, making it a good VPN for streaming.\nIts wallet-friendly pricing sets you back just $12 monthly, $40 for the first year ($50 annually upon renewal) or $79 total for three years. By comparison, most VPNs like NordVPN and ExpressVPN typically charge $60 to $100 a year. The value-packed Surfshark charges about $48 for your first year and its price jumps to $60 after its initial sweet introductory pricing.\nDespite its relatively low cost, PIA doesn\u2019t cut corners. Although it\u2019s not the most feature-rich VPN, you\u2019ll get a solid privacy suite, including a kill switch that stops your internet if your VPN gets disconnected, split tunneling for using a VPN for some apps but not others and 256-bit encryption over OpenVPN or IKEv2 with ChaCha20 on WireGuard. There\u2019s multihop, which routes your connection through another server for additional privacy, and obfuscated servers, making it tougher for apps or ISPs to identify when you\u2019re using a VPN. PIA also boasts unlimited simultaneous connections -- the pricier ExpressVPN limits you to eight.\nUnfortunately, PIA delivered middling internet speeds in our testing with an average speed loss of 49%. All VPNs slow down your connection somewhat, with the fastest VPNs offering an average internet speed loss of 25% or less. Folks with faster internet connections like fiber shouldn\u2019t notice a difference even with a higher speed loss but PIA isn\u2019t ideal for people with slower speeds like satellite internet users. With its decent features, pricing transparency and subscriptions that significantly undercut the competition, PIA remains a solid VPN that boasts a generous server network, unlimited simultaneous connections and relative affordability compared to VPN rivals. But for the price, you're better off with Surfshark, which is faster and offers a larger global server network.\nIPVanish\nIPVanish offers 2,400-plus servers in 108 countries, which is in the same ballpark as NordVPN, Proton VPN, ExpressVPN and Surfshark. (Disclosure: IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) In our experience, IPVanish's internet download speeds were uneven, with a 44% average internet download speed loss in our 2024 testing, with fast speeds marred by occasionally noticeable dips, which could impact gaming or 4K streaming.\nIPVanish provides plenty of perks, including unlimited simultaneous connections, user-friendly apps and great streaming capabilities. It streams and unblocks region-restricted content from Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, Hulu and Netflix with aplomb. At $13 monthly, $40 for the first year or $53 total for two years, IPVanish initially saves you money upfront compared to competitors like ExpressVPN or NordVPN. However, its exorbitantly expensive renewal prices of $156 a year for the annual plan and $312 for the two-year plan trounce even pricey autorenewals of ExpressVPN ($117 autorenewal) and NordVPN ($140 renewal). IPVanish works fine for casual use but you can get a VPN with more robust privacy features and faster internet speeds, all of which benefit travel. IPVanish\u2019s user-friendly apps make it a decent choice for beginners seeking a VPN to add peace of mind and allow for streaming abroad. But wallet-friendly VPNs PIA and Surfshark are better options for the money because of their larger server networks.\nCyberGhost\nWith 11,500-plus servers spanning 100 countries, CyberGhost offers loads of choices for international travel. It\u2019s decent for streaming from BBC iPlayer, Netflix and other sites. You can use specific servers optimized for streaming, but streaming works on all servers. CyberGhost remains wallet-friendly at $13 per month, $42 every six months or $57 total for the first two years of service (you\u2019re billed annually after 24 months of service on its two-year plan).\nCyberGhost lacks advanced privacy features like Tor Over VPN or double-hop servers, both of which make it even more difficult to trace your traffic back to its source. There is obfuscation, which makes it more difficult to determine that you\u2019re using a VPN, which can circumvent restrictions by countries, ISPs or Wi-Fi networks that have blocked VPNs. Obfuscated servers could be useful when running a VPN at school, work or in a country where virtual private networks are frowned upon.\nCyberGhost's high internet speed loss isn\u2019t ideal for demanding applications like 4K streaming or gaming. CyberGhost does provide some useful features, including a kill switch, which shuts off your internet if your VPN gets disconnected, and split tunneling for selectively choosing some apps but not all to route through your VPN. All things considered, CyberGhost is acceptable for casual use like streaming videos or web browsing, and its exhaustive server network is particularly well-suited to travel. Uneven speed loss and middle-of-the-road privacy features mean you\u2019ve likely got better choices.\nWhat to look forward to in 2025\nOut top-rated VPNs -- ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN and Mullvad -- all now offer Linux GUI apps, which are easier to use for beginners than command-line-only apps. So if you're a Linux user and want to bring your Linux laptop along while traveling, you can install an intuitive graphical user interface VPN app. In July 2025, ExpressVPN announced that it had server locations in all 50 US states, making is great for travel to and within the United States, as well as solid for streaming regional sports content, such as NFL, WNBA or NWSL games.\nAlongside traditional VPN protocols, like WireGuard (or its equivalents) and OpenVPN, some VPN providers now provide obfuscation-focused VPN protocols, such as NordVPN's NordWhisper and Proton VPN's Stealth, which try to mask the fact that you're using a VPN. If you need to have a VPN running in a situation where VPNs are frowned upon -- such as in certain countries or on school Wi-Fi, for instance -- an obfuscation-centric VPN protocol could come in handy."

Key mistakes to avoid include geotagging locations, sharing daily routines, and posting about expensive purchases, as these can signal to criminals when homes are unoccupied. Home security technology has advanced, leading to a decrease in burglaries, but criminals are adapting by using social media to scout for vulnerable homes. To protect oneself, individuals should be cautious about what they share online and consider implementing various home security measures.",
