Credit conditions have worsened, leading to bankruptcies and a slowdown in machinery purchases despite new technology displays. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown threatens farm labor, with officials claiming domestic workers could replace migrants, but industry leaders argue automation and Medicaid workers are unrealistic. The overall picture shows a stressed US agricultural sector grappling with trade, credit, and labor challenges.",
