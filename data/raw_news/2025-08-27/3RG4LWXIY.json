  "content": "NEWPORT BEACH, CA., Aug. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Talonvest Capital, Inc., a boutique commercial real estate advisory firm, has successfully arranged a $21,500,000 bridge loan for the refinance of a newly developed, Class-A multifamily building located in the Koreatown neighborhood of Los Angeles, CA. The financing was secured on behalf of EGC Real Estate, a privately held commercial real estate development firm with over four decades of experience, specializing in multifamily and luxury residential properties across Southern California.\n\nLocated at 905 South Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles, Kanvas Apartments comprises 67 units, featuring 13 studio units, 33 one-bed/one-bath units, and 21 two-bed/one-bath units, as well as a ground-floor retail space.

Residents benefit from its proximity to the market, El Super, directly across the street.\n\nTalonvest negotiated the financing with a debt fund, securing a non-recourse, three-year bridge loan with two 12-month extension options.
