      "feedback": "High-signal upgrade feedback in one paragraph: the piece correctly flags five threads but its causal chain is too loose and under-quantified for a 0–3 week horizon; restructure into a tight four‑channel, near-term map—housing policy risk in Bethel (75‑unit, five‑story plan; 8‑30g override; 5% affordable stock in Bethel; ~$582–$583k median home price; ~$115k median income; watch the planning commission decision date and any will-serve or health/safety findings; litigation triggers if the project is rejected), macro/monetary regime (Lagarde on central‑bank independence; Powell/Jackson Hole dynamics; potential rate-path surprises and risk‑premium spillovers), tariff transmission (S15934PBQ: tariffs cut from 27.5% to 15% but with mixed claims on price pass‑through; Toyota NA loss of $438m; U.S. onshoring investment; monitor any new tariff headlines or policy pivots), and consumer/services‑cost signals (6OOEK8TUR: Las Vegas tourism/price pressures—Diet Coke $15, water $26, $40 nachos—signal near‑term discretionary spending risk). Ground every claim in numbers from the sources (cite F8GF45MEU for Bethel and 8‑30g context, U6HXAJR4J for Lagarde/Jackson Hole framing, S15934PBQ for tariffs, 6OOEK8TUR for Vegas pricing signals, 8VMO3PFEO for BeeStation economics) and, where national context helps, lean on USAFacts data (e.g., 2023 US median household income ~$77.7k) to calibrate Bethel’s affluence relative to the baseline; add explicit, testable near‑term catalysts and invalidation triggers (Bethel: either approval/compromise or litigation victory for opponents; macro: a clear shift in Jackson Hole messaging or Powell stance; tariffs: a fresh tariff outcome that meaningfully changes pass‑through; Vegas: a measurable uptick in visitor spend or return to prior price levels) and a concise “watch list” with dates; tighten the prose to show a clear causal chain from policy or price shocks to market transmission (real estate sentiment and permitting velocity; consumer demand; equities/rates in the near term) rather than a stitched set of anecdotes; avoid implying a single market direction and instead present probability‑weighted scenarios (low/med/high) for each catalyst; ensure every substantive assertion maps to one of the IDs (F8GF45MEU, U6HXAJR4J, S15934PBQ, 6OOEK8TUR, 8VMO3PFEO) and reconcile minor conflicts (e.g., tariff pass‑through versus absorption) by stating the source’s stance and the likely range of market impact.",
