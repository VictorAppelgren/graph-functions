  "title": "Critical Role choosing D&D over Daggerheart for Campaign 4 makes sense",
  "description": "Not going with Daggerheart was the right choice",
  "content": "Critical Role's Campaign 4 is already surprising fans months before its official start. First came the announcement that Brennan Lee Mulligan of Dimension 20 fame would be the Game Master, letting Matt Mercer finally break free of the \"eternal DM\" curse. Then, on Aug. 21, the question that everyone was asking was answered: Campaign 4 would not use Critical Role's in-house game, Daggerheart, but would stick with Dungeons & Dragons.\n\nThe decision has sparked debate. I've read TTRPG players online claiming that, while they were on the fence about Daggerheart but looking forward to trying it on the heels of Campaign 4, they will now abandon that prospect completely. If Critical Role isn't willing to bet on their own game, why should players? That's a reasonable argument, but I also think that after taking a deeper look, it's easy to understand why Critical Role decided to use D&D for their upcoming campaign.\n\nBrennan Lee Mulligan is not just the Game Master for Campaign 4, he's also the creator of the world in which the new game will take place, Aram\u00e1n. Much like Exandria (the world where the first three campaigns of Critical Role take place), it's not unlikely that this setting will spark its own products, starting from sourcebooks and ranging to other media. If Mulligan is a smart about his business, as well as his storytelling, he will be thinking about this. We also don't know when his deal with Critical Role was finalized, and at the time Mulligan could have already had a deal with Wizards of the Coast to publish his products under the D&D umbrella.\n\nAlso, Mulligan has probably been working on this world for a long time, starting when Daggerheart was still in development. The most logical choice, thus, was to tailor Aram\u00e1n for D&D rather than for a game that still had to come out. Could Mulligan adapt his work for Daggerheart? Absolutely, but something else has to be considered, then. Choosing Daggerheart for Campaign 4 was not convenient for Critical Role, either.\n\nI wrote earlier this month that Critical Role and Wizards have entered a \"cold war,\" and I still think it's an accurate statement. During the actual Cold War, the last thing that the United States and the Soviet Union wanted was to drop bombs on each other, aware of the mutual destruction consequences. Similarly, Critical Role has no interest in pissing off Wizards by dropping D&D from its most-watched actual play show. Their media powerhouse is built on Dungeons & Dragons, after all. And the group can always keep playing and showcasing Daggerheart on any other occasion. During the Aug. 21 announcement, Critical Role founders Matt Mercer, Travis Willingham, and Marisha Ray stated that more Age of Umbra and other Daggerheart content is on the horizon, plus more partners will be doing Daggerheart actual plays, including Dungeons & Dads and Legends of Avantris.\n\nConsidering that the game is already sold out, Critical Role probably wasn't worried about pushing Daggerheart into every corner of the business. Instead, the creatives behind it took the more cautious approach and avoided two dangers: alienating part of their fanbase who could have been put off by the change in system, and souring their relationship with Wizards of the Coast. Finally, let's not forget that Daggerheart is still a newborn game. It may simply not be ready to be showcased on such a stage during a years-long campaign. Meanwhile, Chris Perkins and Jeremy Crawford \u2014 the former creative director and game director for D&D \u2014 are working on their Daggerheart setting. Once that is ready, I'm sure there will be a good chance to see it showcased, perhaps during Critical Role Campaign Five.\n\nChoosing Daggerheart for Campaign Four would have been a bold choice for Critical Role. Instead, they took the most business-savvy decision and went with Dungeons & Dragons. Time will tell what impact, if any, this will have on the future of the two games.",

      "text": "The popularity of the actual play show Critical Role helped make 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons wildly successful. But now, Critical Role Productions has become more than a booster and frequent collaborator for D&D: It\u2019s become a competitor. After years in development, Daggerheart, a tabletop RPG from Critical Role\u2019s publishing imprint, Darrington Press, launches today. And the book shows just how much lead designer Spenser Starke and the book\u2019s other designers have learned from playing 5e, as they address some of that game\u2019s biggest issues.\nProblem: Failure is boring\nThere are few things as satisfying as rolling a natural 20 in a clutch situation in D&D, but D&D\u2019s d20 system has a big drawback. It\u2019s inherently very swingy, with a wide range from success to failure, and it can lead to situations where failure means the PCs accomplish nothing, and the story doesn\u2019t move forward in a meaningful way. Roll low, and you might miss an attack, miss a key clue needed to progress the plot, or be unable to bypass a locked door to get to the next goal.\nDaggerheart changes the math by having players roll two d12s and add the results, which generally smooths the probability curve in favor of success. But the more significant change is a system inspired by how Fantasy Flight\u2019s Star Wars roleplaying game represents the pull of the light side and dark side of the Force. One of the d12s represents hope, while the other is fear, and the higher number determines which aspect is dominant in the totalled roll.\nSucceeding with hope is nothing but good news for the PCs. Failing with hope gives them a hope point, a resource that can be spent on numerous special abilities, as a sort of consolation prize. Fear, in turn, gives the game master a fear point they can use to introduce complications or activate abilities for antagonistic NPCs.\nThat system, combined with a collaborative narrative focus, means there\u2019s never an instance where a roll has no effect. If you can\u2019t pick that lock, you might hear guards approaching, or even trigger a trap, depending on whether you failed with hope or fear. Miss a roll with fear in combat, and an antagonist will get a turn to act. Failure always has consequences that move the game forward.\nProblem: Advantage and disadvantage are too significant\nOne of 5e\u2019s key mechanics is the concept of advantage and disadvantage \u2014 rolling two d20s and taking the better or worse result, respectively. It\u2019s an elegant way to avoid having numerous modifiers for conditions like being aided by an ally or trying to strike a hidden foe. But the math makes those edges and penalties too significant.\nDaggerheart keeps the concept, but changes the effect to adding or subtracting a d6. The game also simplifies D&D\u2019s laundry list of conditions \u2014 \u201cgrappled,\u201d \u201cparalyzed,\u201d \u201cheavily obscured,\u201d etc. \u2014 to just three options: \u201chidden,\u201d \u201crestrained,\u201d and \u201cvulnerable.\u201d It creates a convenient way to modify rolls without making GMs worry about the specific mechanics too much.\nProblem: Species and background choices are too important\nIn the original 5e ruleset, players had to limit their species and background choices to ensure they got attribute boosts to the key stats for their class, or risk not being able to hit as frequently or do as much damage as players who made the more optimized choices. The 2024 ruleset removed attribute bonuses from species, but instead shunted them into backgrounds. That means you\u2019re operating at a real disadvantage if, for story reasons, you want your wizard to have been a soldier instead of a scribe.\nAttributes are entirely divorced from these decisions in Daggerheart, and just assigned based on what\u2019s best for your character class. The other decisions give you flavorful minor abilities that might be better for some classes, but are fairly broadly applicable, like a giant having extra hit points, or a person who grew up in the wilderness being able to move silently. It keeps the mechanics from getting in the way of the fantasy.\nProblem: Spellcasters have a lot more choices than non-casters\nAdmittedly, this isn\u2019t a problem for everyone. Some new TTRPG players can be intimidated by lots of options, and might prefer the simplicity of playing a fighter who\u2019s mostly going to move and attack on their turn, rather than considering which spells to use and prepare. Wizards of the Coast worked to offer more complexity to martial characters in the 2024 rules with the weapon mastery system, but mostly created more subclasses that are hybrids of casters and weapon-wielders.\nNo matter your class, Daggerheart characters all have equivalent options, thanks to a card system reminiscent of 4e D&D or Gloomhaven. Every level, characters get to choose new cards, which could represent a wizard using a runic ward, or a bard bolstering their allies with a pep talk. The modularity of the system also makes it easier to multiclass by just taking cards associated with other classes, at the price of digging deeper into your base abilities.\nThere\u2019s still more work to be done\nFor all the problems they\u2019ve solved, the Daggerheart designers left some big holes that need filling. The downtime action section is very thinly sketched. The game is deeply ambivalent about loot, preferring to abstract treasure rewards and costs into amounts like \u201ca handful of gold\u201d or \u201ca chest of gold.\u201d Upgrading gear is important to stay competitive, but the section on weapons is the weakest past of the entire book: Weapons follow a clear linear progression based on character tier, but their stats are printed over and over again, rather than being condensed with the formula.\nAnd GMs are encouraged to come up with their own gear, but there are no tools provided. Special items only available at higher tiers have random names, like Wand of Essek or Aantari Bow, with no descriptions to give them the character of powerful D&D magic items.\nBut overall, Daggerheart is a strong evolution of medieval fantasy roleplaying. It shows a deep understanding of Dungeons & Dragons\u2019 flaws, addressing them by drawing on the strengths of other systems. Even for groups not ready to fully make the switch to a new game, the book can provide some inspiration for making a D&D game a bit better.\nDaggerheart is available for purchase now at through Critical Role shops and local game stores in the Darrington Press Guild, which offer a PDF free with a physical copy. The core set will arrive at Amazon and book stores including Barnes & Noble and Books-A-Million starting June 3. The free beta playtest is still available at DriveThruRPG.\nFor those who want to see Daggerheart in action, Critical Role has released several one-shots and specials. \u201cAge of Umbra,\u201d new eight-episode series run by Matthew Mercer will launch on May 29."

      "text": "When it comes to dominating the TTRPG scene, Critical Role can\u2019t stop, won\u2019t stop. Having mainstreamed Dungeons & Dragons actual play, adapted their campaigns into popular animated series, and launched their own tabletop system in this year\u2019s Daggerheart, it\u2019d be easy to think the CR gang might be out of surprises. Then Brennan Lee Mulligan showed up.\nOn Saturday night, Critical Role officially announced Campaign 4, which will, for the first time in CR\u2019s core campaign, introduce a brand new host: Dimension 20\u2019s Dungeon Master. Mulligan will take over for Matt Mercer when Campaign 4 launches in October.\nAccording to a news release, Mulligan will step into the Game Master seat for the full duration of Campaign 4, \u201cbringing his signature depth, humor, wit, and high-stakes drama to Critical Role\u2019s next grand adventure.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been enormous fans of Brennan\u2019s for many years now, and when it came to giving both Matthew Mercer and the world of Exandria a bit of a breather, Brennan felt like the perfect storyteller to take our community somewhere entirely new.\u201d said CR CEO and cast member Travis Willingham. \u201cCritical Role has always been about genuine connection through storytelling first and foremost, and as Brennan himself will tell you, he\u2019s still played more TTRPGs away from a camera than in front of it. His passion and drive for worldbuilding is infectious, and it's been an absolute joy to spark off him as we forge ahead.\"\n\"What a gift, a privilege and an honor to be invited behind the screen of Critical Role for this next epic adventure,\" said Mulligan. \"Every collaboration we have had together has brought nothing but sheer joy, and Campaign 4 will be no exception. I'm finally playing *almost* as much tabletop as I'd like to!\"\nFor anyone worried about Mulligan\u2019s tenure on Dimension 20 and Dropout.TV, fear not: Per Variety, he has also signed a three-year contract to continue work with the improv comedy network.\nCritical Role says Campaign 4 will premiere on Thursday, Oct. 2 with instant access on Beacon.tv as well as streamed to the official YouTube and Twitch channels. The VOD will be available to all on the following Mondays.\nHere at Polygon, we\u2019re big fans of all things Critical Role, Dimension 20, and all things Mulligan. Here\u2019s a recent highlight of CR\u2019s new DM in action."

      "text": "Tabletop role-playing games fans usually get their excitement from letting their imagination run free and living amazing adventures from the comfort of their homes. However, that excitement is spilling out into the real world as some noticeable momentum is rocking the status quo in the TTRPG industry.\nEarlier this year, the two biggest designers responsible for the fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons, Chris Perkins and Jeremy Crawford, left Wizards of the Coast to pursue new professional avenues. In June, the two were presented as the new creative director and game director for Darrington Press, the tabletop-games publishing arm of Critical Role. This came on the heels of the official release of Critical Role\u2019s first TTRPG: Daggerheart. After the group became famous for playing D&D on their successful actual play show, which spawned a multimedia sensation, they are now ready to offer an alternative for gamers.\nWhile I love drama just as much as anyone else, one thing must be clear: The two sides are not at odds. Critical Role and Wizards of the Coast are still working together, and Mercer & Co.\u2019s recently announced Campaign 4 will likely be using the D&D system like the three previous ones. Perkins and Crawford continue to appear in official D&D posts on social media and at other promotional events. Both parties have made it clear that their relationship is as amicable as possible. However, just like during the Cold War, it seems that the TTRPGs world will now be gravitating around two superpowers whose choices and actions will, in large part, influence the future of the industry. And among the two sides, one seems a lot more active and bolder than the other.\nAfter the announcement on Aug. 4 that Brennan Lee Mulligan will be the dungeon master for Critical Role\u2019s campaign 4, it\u2019s undeniable that, as we wrote in our coverage of that news, \u201cWhen it comes to dominating the TTRPG scene, Critical Role can\u2019t stop, won\u2019t stop.\u201d They have now officially assembled an all-star team that will make comparisons with the Avengers trite but inevitable. But if Critical Role has become the World\u2019s Mightiest Heroes of TTRPG, then what about Wizards of the Coast? The company that, you know, owns the rights to the game that made Critical Role a thing?\nMarvel Comics fans with a mischievous attitude may be quick to compare Wizards with the Champions or even the Great Lake Avengers, but the company is actually not sitting on its hands. On June 30, Dan Ayoub, who recently became the head of the Dungeons & Dragons franchise for Wizards, shared a post on D&D Beyond, aptly titled \u201cD&D\u2019s New Direction.\u201d After acknowledging the importance that D&D had in his life and career, Ayoub wrote: \u201cI\u2019m here to open a dialogue with you \u2013 the players, Dungeon Masters, live stream watchers, and storytellers.\u201d He then moved to list the four core points of this strategy: a reassurance that the D&D 2024 rules do not replace 5e but enhance them; the promise to update the System Reference Document (SRD) regularly; the reveal that the Maps virtual tabletop system will be free for all D&D Beyond users, starting Sep. 16; the announcement of a new initiative \u201cto create a rotating advisory group made of creators, publishers, educators, and fans,\u201d which will help the company shape future tools, policies, and products.\nThe point about the SRD will surely reassure the many creators who publish their own D&D products under the Creative Commons license, and making Maps free will improve many online games, but the final point looks like the most interesting. After having lost its top creative minds (as a reminder, Mike Mearls, another lead designer for 5e, left in 2024 for rival Chaosium,) Wizards\u2019 D&D department clearly has to think about the future carefully and design a strategy that will let the product move forward without being offset by these losses. And the hits keep coming: The creator of the Eberron setting, Keith Baker, will design an original Daggerheart setting, while Crawford and Perkins are also developing their own setting for Darrington\u2019s game. It seems that Wizards\u2019 strategy will be to get the community and its most active members more involved. A grassroots approach may truly bring a fresh perspective to the product and push it in unexpected directions, but it will be interesting to see how it will clash with a company that has acquired a reputation for being ruthless and profit-driven in the eyes of those same fans it now wants to involve.\nAgain, there is no official competition between Critical Role and Wizards of the Coast. Daggerheart is still a newborn game, and even the great sales numbers from its release do not guarantee that it will ever reach the popularity and diffusion of Dungeons & Dragons. However, the latter\u2019s recent mainstream success was built on a number of factors (hello, Stranger Things!) that include Critical Role\u2019s popularity. What happens when Mercer, Willingham, Bailey, Riegel, etc., decide to put all their efforts into pushing their own game?\nAnd even if we discard an hypothetical \u201cD&D vs. Daggerheart\u201d scenario, with the moves that Critical Role is making, at the very least Wizards should be worried, from a brand perspective, that the product it labels \u201cThe world\u2019s greatest role-playing game\u201d could soon be associated more easily with a third party than with the company that owns it."

  "argos_summary": "Critical Role\u2019s upcoming Campaign\u202f4 will use Dungeons & Dragons instead of its own Daggerheart system, a decision driven by business considerations, the new world Aram\u00e1n\u2019s fit with 5e, and a desire to avoid alienating fans and souring ties with Wizards of the Coast.  The campaign will be led by Brennan Lee Mulligan, who created Aram\u00e1n and will bring a fresh West\u2011Marches\u2011style structure to the show.  Mulligan\u2019s long\u2011term partnership with Wizards and the fact that Daggerheart is still a nascent product make D&D the safer, more familiar choice for a high\u2011profile, multi\u2011platform production.  The move reflects Critical Role\u2019s strategy to balance innovation with the commercial realities of its flagship franchise.",
