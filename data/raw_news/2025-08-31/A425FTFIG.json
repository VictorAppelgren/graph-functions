  "content": "After implementing an AI chatbot in the Apple Support app to help customers a few weeks ago, the company is taking their AI chatbot push a step further. With Asa, Apple retail employees will now be able to ask questions and learn more about Apple products to improve their sales abilities.\n\nThis feature will soon be widely available in Apple\u2019s internal \u2018SEED\u2019 app, which retail employees use to learn more about Apple and its products. It generally serves as a training tool.\n\nAccording to the screenshots from MacRumors analyst Aaron Perris, the chatbot can help employees learn more about Apple advantages, learn about varying use cases for the iPhone, and more. Employees are also free to prompt it with whatever question they\u2019d like. Right now, this feature is still in testing.\n\nWhile we won\u2019t get to see this chatbots abilities for ourselves, it\u2019s certainly an interesting push on Apple\u2019s end. Ideally, this will help newer retail employees become more knowledgeable at a faster speed. The timing certainly aligns quite nicely with the upcoming iPhone 17 launch.\n\nApple is yet to release a general purpose AI chatbot to the public. Rumors currently point to Apple hosting a version of Google Gemini on its own servers for future Siri features.\n\nUpgrade your iPhone and save money with Amazon Renewed deals:",

      "text": "Apple has officially announced its next product event where it will announce the new iPhone 17 lineup alongside new Apple Watch hardware. The event will take place on Tuesday, September 9. The tagline for the event reads \u201cAwe dropping\u201d and features an infrared view of the Apple logo.\nWhat to expect\nApple will announce four new iPhones, including an ultra thin model.\n- iPhone 17\n- iPhone 17 Air\n- iPhone 17 Pro\n- iPhone 17 Pro Max\nThe iPhone 17 is expected to mostly be an internal update to the iPhone 16 design introduced last year. Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 Air will be Apple\u2019s new ultra thin design with a display slightly smaller than the iPhone 16 Plus that it replaces in the lineup. Like the iPhone mini before it, the iPhone Plus is expected to retire after a few short years.\niPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will share similar specs, aside from the display size, and thickness could actually increase this year, especially in the Max size, possibly in service of greater battery life. Both Pro models as well as the Air model should feature a redesigned camera system that spans across the width of the back glass instead of a round box positioned on the top left. Apple is also expected to sell iPhone 17 Pro for a higher price with fewer storage options. We\u2019ll also likely see the iPhone 15, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max be discontinued following the event.\nWe also expect to see two updated Apple Watch models:\n- Apple Watch Series 11\n- Apple Watch Ultra 3\nApple may also announce AirPods Pro 3 after a few years of revving AirPods Pro 2. At last year\u2019s iPhone event, Apple introduced AirPods 4 and AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancelation, so that hardware is still relatively new.\nMeanwhile, Apple may introduce a new premium case option called TechWoven. This technical fabric option is the next successor to leather, following the failed FineWoven fiasco from two years ago.\nThe name \u201cLiquid Silicone\u201d has been tossed around for Apple\u2019s standard silicone cases. We\u2019ll see if that name sticks or if it was just a rumor.\nBoth official Apple cases will likely feature lanyard holes on either side of the case bottom. This would support a single lanyard loop like the AirPods Pro 2 case. We may see an official Crossbody Strap accessory that uses both lanyard loop attachments to turn your iPhone into a sling, of sorts.\nSeparately, a rumored iPhone 4-style Bumper case that wraps around the edges may be planned for the iPhone 17 Air. Apple has also reportedly considered bringing back its discontinued MagSafe battery pack specifically for the iPhone 17 Air at some point.\nNew Apple Watch models are typically joined by updated watch bands too. This could mean new colors, new designs, and possibly new materials. When Apple dropped leather as part of its Apple 2030 carbon neutrality goal, it replaced existing leather straps with FineWoven versions that are still sold today. Will TechWoven replace FineWoven this year?\nTop comment by AlexNe01\nIt looks like we will have rumored orange and blue colors in the lineup.\nWe\u2019ll see all that and more at Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 event in two weeks.\nHow to watch\nThe event will air on Tuesday, September 9, at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET. The event will be pre-recorded with some media in attendance at Apple Park in Cupertino, California. Apple streams its events on apple.com, YouTube, and the Apple TV app.\nAs always, 9to5Mac will bring you every detail from the iPhone 17 event as soon as news breaks. Stay tuned to 9to5Mac in the meantime as we continue to learn more about what Apple has planned for its fall event.\nChance Miller and I will be in attendance for 9to5Mac\u2019s hands-on coverage of everything announced in two weeks.\nCheck out these great accessories\nApple AirTag | Add Find My tracking to anything\nBeats USB-A to USB-C Cable | The official CarPlay cable\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "Apple seems open to anything and everything when it comes to delivering the next generation of Siri. After reports that it could be powered by OpenAI or Anthropic, Google has entered the conversation.\nMark Gurman reports for Bloomberg that Google, which offers a ChatGPT competitor called Gemini, is actually training a model that could run on Apple\u2019s servers to power the new Siri experience:\nThe iPhone maker recently approached Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google to explore building a custom AI model that would serve as the foundation of the new Siri next year, according to people familiar with the matter. Google has started training a model that could run on Apple\u2019s servers, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.\nGurman, who originally reported that Apple was considering OpenAI and Anthropic as solutions, says no decision has been reached yet, but Apple is putting the models head-to-head against its own models:\nInternally, Apple is holding a bake-off to see which approach will work best. The company is simultaneously developing two versions of the new Siri: one dubbed Linwood that is powered by its models and another code-named Glenwood that runs on outside technology.\nGemini currently powers Android\u2019s AI system as well as Samsung\u2019s. The tool is also used to make AI features in lots of services and apps possible, including in third-party software that runs on Mac, iPhone, and iPad.\nTop comment by Steve\nSounds like Apple is going to be the big AI winner here. Apple will have its own models and also offer the various and numerous 3rd party models available. It\u2019s like the search wars all over again only this time Apple has its own search engine too.\nClaude AI model maker Anthropic has reportedly been viewed as the favorite by Apple, but the AI firm may be asking too high a price for powering the new Siri.\nSeparately, Gurman reports that some Apple leaders have considered using non-Apple models to power features under the Apple Intelligence umbrella, but Apple is only actively considering sourcing a possible Siri model provider for now.\nMeanwhile, Apple has reportedly begun testing its first trillion parameter model that would be much more powerful than its existing 150 billion parameter models in use on Apple servers today.\nTo recap, Apple first announced an all-new Siri experience in June 2024 that it promised to deliver in iOS 18. After major roadblocks, leadership reorganization, and starting over with a new system, Apple delayed the original announcement with a new deadline of sometime in 2026. Apple is said to be targeting a spring release.\nCheck out these great accessories\nApple AirTag | Add Find My tracking to anything\nBeats USB-A to USB-C Cable | The official CarPlay cable\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
