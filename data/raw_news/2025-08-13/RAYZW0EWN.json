  "title": "Stuff Your Kindle Day Is Back: How to Get Free Historical Fiction Books",
  "description": "The latest opportunity to get hundreds of free books onto your ereader offers historical fiction titles as well as many contemporary stories.",
  "content": "Stuff Your Kindle Day is an opportunity to get lots of free, or at least remarkably cheap, ebooks into your virtual library. These events happen around once a month with recent opportunities focusing on romance novels , and another event offering free science fiction titles.\n\nThis latest Stuff Your Kindle Day, run by Indie Authors Central, is called Stepping Through Time , and it offers a combination of historical fiction books as well as some stories set in the modern day. The logo to represent the event shows a Medieval castle but with a New York City cab outside. Various authors have contributed books to the event, and there are hundreds of free options to download.\n\nDespite being called Stuff Your Kindle Day, this sale is set to last for four days in total, running until August 16. Everything you download is yours to keep forever, so there\u2019s no harm in downloading lots of titles that you think you may only get to read at a later date.\n\nYou can download these books to a Kindle, Kobo, or Nook ereader, as well as to options like the Kindle app for smartphones or computer. You don\u2019t necessarily need a separate ereader to get involved.\n\nThis Stuff Your Kindle Day appears to be an eclectic mix with titles including time-travel romance books, stories about archaeologists who have a love triangle with a minotaur, and traditional mystery novels set in the modern day.\n\nThe next event is set for just over a month's time and it's called Into The Darkness, focusing on what Indie Authors Central call \"dark fiction.\" Then we're into Halloween time with an event called Get Spooked set to start on October 26. That will see horror, thriller, paranormal, and mystery books put up for free.\n\nThe rest of the year will see a Christian book blast set for November 18, followed by Winter Wonderland on December 16. Each of these upcoming events will last for four days each.",
