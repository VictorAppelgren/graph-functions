  "content": "On this episode of Stock Movers: Listen for comprehensive cross-platform coverage of the US market close as heard on Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio, and YouTube with Matt Miller, Katie Greifeld, Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec. - Intel (INTC) shares jumped on reports the Trump administration is in talks to have the US government potentially take a stake in the beleaguered chipmaker, according to people familiar with the plan, in the latest sign of the White House\u2019s willingness to blur the lines between state and industry. The deal would help shore up Intel\u2019s planned factory hub in Ohio, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. The company had once promised to turn that site into the world\u2019s largest chipmaking facility, though it\u2019s been repeatedly delayed. The size of the potential stake isn\u2019t clear. The plans stem from a meeting this week between President Donald Trump and Intel Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan, the people said. While the details are still being sorted, the idea is for the US government to pay for the stake, one of the people said. Another cautioned that the plans remain fluid. - Bullish (BLSH) shares still climbed on its second day of trading. Bullish, which counts former New York Stock Exchange president Tom Farley as its Chief Executive Officer, offers crypto spot trading, margin trading and derivatives trading, with a focus on institutional investors, the filings show. Its margin and derivatives products aren\u2019t currently available in the US or to US users. - Tapestry (TPR) shares tumbled the most intraday since March 2020, after the owner of Coach and Kate Spade forecast adjusted earnings per share for 2026 that fell short of Wall Street\u2019s high expectations. Shares have climbed 69% from April 9 to Wednesday\u2019s close.",
