  "title": "OnePlus Buds 4 vs. Nothing Ear: Which Pair of Wireless Earbuds Wins?",
  "description": "We know Nothing has style, but can it beat OnePlus' substance?",
  "content": "There are so many wireless earbuds. No, for real. As someone who tests out earbuds on a very regular basis, I can tell you firsthand just how crowded the market is. That\u2019s fine if you\u2019re easy and just want a pair of AirPods, but for anyone who wants to dig deeper into what\u2019s out there\u2014whether for design or compatibility reasons\u2014a crowded field makes research a nightmare. And that research headache doubles when two pairs of earbuds are similarly priced.\n\nLuckily, as someone who has used entirely too many pairs of earbuds, I\u2019m here to help you sort through a crowded field that includes two pairs that may already be on your radar: the $130 OnePlus Buds 4 and the $150 Nothing Ear. While both of these pairs are similarly priced, there are some key differences that you might want to keep in mind before you pull the trigger\u2014and it\u2019s not just the look, either. Here\u2019s my breakdown of which pair takes the cake, from one wireless earbud nerd to another.\n\nSee Nothing Ear at Amazon\n\nWhile this may be obvious, these two pairs of earbuds look very different. That\u2019s not surprising since Nothing has built a lot of its company around differentiating itself with see-through design, but it\u2019s worth noting nonetheless.\n\nJust like my AirPods Max vs. Headphone 1 comparison, the battle between the OnePlus Buds 4 and Nothing Ear is a fight between minimalism and distinct aesthetics. Which one appeals to you is very subjective, but if you\u2019re in the market for the latter, then the Nothing Ear will likely be your frontrunner here. Like Nothing\u2019s previous wireless earbuds, the Nothing Ear incorporates a transparent design that showcases some internal components. It\u2019s subtle but definitely sets the earbuds apart from a sea of AirPods and AirPods lookalikes. I personally love the emphasis on transparency, which evokes old Game Boys and those see-through LAN lines kids in the \u201990s had in their bedrooms. With that said, style mileage (styleage?) may vary depending on your taste.\n\nThe OnePlus Buds 4, while I criticized them for looking boring, may appeal to the more minimalist-minded. They\u2019re sleek and smooth and very unlikely to stand out when you\u2019re wearing them, which is a benefit depending on what you\u2019re looking for. If you want something flashier, Nothing Ear is the clear winner. If you want wireless earbuds that fade into the background, the OnePlus Buds 4 win. I personally give Nothing points here for trying something new that also feels stylish and not obtuse, so the Ear wins this round. Sorry, OnePlus, but you\u2019ve got to give me something if you\u2019re going to beat Nothing.\n\nIn wireless earbuds, like in life, looks only get you so far. Probably (hopefully) a big factor in your decision to buy one pair over another will be sound. This is where things get interesting. While there\u2019s not a huge difference out of the box for these two pairs of earbuds, each company puts its own spin on the software side of things that makes a noticeable difference.\n\nSound-wise, the OnePlus Buds 4 deliver quality, especially when it comes to bass. Though some bassy wireless earbuds can sound over-simulated to a degree, I found that the OnePlus Buds 4 have a more natural-sounding low end. The secret sauce to the OnePlus Buds 4 is using its app-based ear tuning that adjusts frequencies to your specific hearing. After you take the ear test, that\u2019s when these things really sing. I was able to hear mids and highs much better amid the bass and low end. It\u2019s not that it was muddy with the out-of-the-box balanced tuning, but there\u2019s no beating having each frequency tailored to your ears.\n\nTo its credit, Nothing has its own ear tuning through the Nothing X app, but I find the results (while better than the out-of-the-box sound) to be less drastically different than OnePlus. That being said, the Nothing Ear still have solid sound thanks to its ceramic drivers\u2014a perk that is not present in the Ear A. Highs and mids get a boost after taking the Nothing X hearing test, but they don\u2019t sound as augmented as using OnePlus\u2019 version. Also, while low end is important to everyone who wears wireless earbuds, OnePlus definitely offers more on that front.\n\nStill, I think with the better software calibration, my point goes to the OnePlus Buds 4. Software-assisted or not, more nuanced sound is hard to beat, and OnePlus brings more to the party in this case.\n\nWhile there\u2019s not as much comfort variation in wireless earbuds compared to headphones, it\u2019s still worth noting how they fit, even if ear shapes and sizes vary wildly. In my experience, no news is good news on the comfort/fit front, and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening with this showdown\u2019s competition.\n\nBoth the OnePlus Buds 4 and the Nothing Ear come with varied ear tip sizes (small, medium, and large), so you should be able to get one that suits you. That isn\u2019t special in the world of wireless earbuds, but more of a basic checklist. The eartips on both pairs are made of silicone, which again, is pretty standard. Ultimately, there\u2019s not much to note with the fit and feel of either of the buds, which is probably a good thing. Given that, I\u2019m going to have to call this one a draw.\n\nSee Nothing Ear at Amazon\n\nOnePlus Buds 4 vs. Nothing Ear: Battery Life and Features\n\nIn my experience testing out a lot of wireless earbuds, battery life seems to be stuck at a ceiling for most pairs that use active noise cancellation (ANC). That ceiling is around 6 hours when ANC is activated (I use the ANC numbers here because you\u2019re probably going to have ANC on most of the time). Both the OnePlus Buds 4 and Nothing Ear arrive near that ceiling, but one pair has a slight edge, and the point here goes to OnePlus.\n\nThe Nothing Ear are rated for 5 hours of battery life with ANC outside the case, and the OnePlus Buds 4 are rated for 6 hours. I\u2019ve been using the Nothing Ear since their release and can corroborate those numbers, though sometimes I\u2019ll get slightly shorter battery life depending on volume (that\u2019s just the way things go in wireless audio). While I haven\u2019t used the OnePlus Buds 4 for quite as long, in my experience, they get that 6 hours of rated battery life, giving them a one-hour edge over the Nothing Ear.\n\nThese buds have a similar feature set: they both have adaptive ANC, personalized audio, a companion app for granular EQ tuning, spatial audio, and support all the same formats for hi-res streaming. The OnePlus Buds 4 do have a dedicated long-range mode if you plan on using your wireless earbuds further away from your device. I don\u2019t suspect that will be a deciding factor for most people, but it\u2019s still nice to have. As I mentioned previously, I think the personalized ear tuning on the OnePlus Buds 4 is slightly better than on the Nothing Ear, so that\u2019s another point for OnePlus.\n\nOne difference to note here is in the on-earbud controls. While Nothing Ear uses pinch controls that require you to squeeze the earbuds to skip tracks, play/pause, and turn ANC on or off, the OnePlus Buds 4 opt for tap and swipe controls. I personally prefer the latter because they feel more gentle and refined, but that will come down to preference. With those differences noted, I\u2019m going to have to go with OnePlus in this category for having slightly better battery life and a slightly larger feature set.\n\nOne of the most interesting battlegrounds for any pair of wireless earbuds is noise cancellation. While ANC isn\u2019t crucial for every pair (open earbuds, for example), wireless earbuds are built to cancel out noise particularly well because they create a tight seal around your ear canal. Given the ability to cancel noise naturally and artificially, it\u2019s important to know which pair has the best ANC numbers.\n\nAnd in this case\u2014sorry, Nothing fans\u2014OnePlus Buds 4 win again. The Nothing Ear is rated for 45 dB of noise cancellation and the OnePlus Buds 4 can cancel up to 55 dB. Having used both, I\u2019m willing to say that number does make a perceptible difference. It\u2019s not glaring by any means, but you get more ambient noise bleed while wearing the Nothing Ear compared to the OnePlus Buds 4. My subway rides just sound a little more like the subway when I\u2019m wearing the Nothing Ear.\n\nBoth wireless earbuds offer adaptive ANC, and you can select levels of ANC manually in an app, so feature-wise they\u2019re in a tie, but if you\u2019re looking for the maximum amount of noise cancellation, there\u2019s a clear winner in the OnePlus Buds 4.\n\nWhile these two pairs of wireless earbuds are similar in a lot of ways, there are some small but key differences in their features, ANC, and design. Some of that will come down to preference\u2014I like how the Nothing Ear looks, but you may not\u2014and other aspects are more objective. If you\u2019re looking for better ANC, more features, and a better personalized EQ, then OnePlus Buds 4 are your pick.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for wireless earbuds that stand out and still offer a fairly rich feature set\u2014even if not everything is the best of the best\u2014then Nothing Ear are a solid pick. I\u2019m still going with the Nothing Ear here, even though they retail for $20 more at $150 versus $130 for the OnePlus Buds 4, just because I love the look, but not everyone is as vain as I am. If you\u2019re more substance over style, do yourself a favor and pick up the OnePlus Buds 4, which are a great pair of wireless earbuds for the value, albeit pretty boring to look at.\n\nSee Nothing Ear at Amazon",

      "text": "Palmer Luckey, the man who took a career crafting VR headsets and turned it into a company that sells weapons of war to the U.S. military, also makes a Game Boy-like handheld. The ModRetro Chromatic, designed to play old Game Boy cartridges, has proved incredibly popular.\nNow, the handheld, in all its original colorways, is back after a year of unavailability, but with a few changes. First, there\u2019s an all-new gray and purple colorway that\u2019s giving SNES vibes. Second, while the Chromatic still starts at $200, which gets you the same magnesium alloy shell and a special copy of Tetris, the screen cover is now Gorilla Glass instead of the more durable, scratch-resistant sapphire glass that all original Chromatics had. If you want the version with the sapphire screen, that now costs $300 (also bundled with Tetris). Whether or not the Chromatic is worth it depends on how much you loved your old Game Boy Color and how much you can stomach Luckey\u2019s ongoing love affair with the military-industrial complex.\nThe Chromatic is a kind of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) emulation device. That means it doesn\u2019t merely recreate Nintendo\u2019s original handheld as software, like most typical emulators do; it effectively replicates the hardware and chip logic. As such, it can play original Game Boy and Game Boy Color cartridges alongside ModRetro\u2019s own \u201cChromatic\u201d cartridges.\nModRetro, a company cofounded by Luckey and fellow Anduril lead Torin Herndon, started promoting the Chromatic almost a year ago alongside a few homebrew games designed for the device. There are a few more ModRetro-specific games to go alongside the handheld re-release. The selection now includes Sabrina: The Animated Series \u2013 Zapped!, First Contact Protocol, Wicked Plague, Self Simulated, and Gravitorque DX. The last of those is a gravity-manipulating indie platformer akin to lo-fi darling VVVVVV from back in 2010. ModRetro is also selling a few more accessories, including a rechargeable battery to replace the old AAs, a mod kit to swap its buttons and D-pad, and a link cable to trade Pok\u00e9mon with friends the old-fashioned way.\nI am pleased to annouce our latest game!\nGravitorque DX is a puzzle platformer where you control gravity instead of jumping, solving mind-bending levels across four distinct worlds.\nGet it now on a REAL cart: https://t.co/94qOCZBbV5@modretro #modretro #GameBoy #gamedev pic.twitter.com/35Ob3LBYXx\n\u2014 Nikita Kurylev (@NikitaKurylev) July 10, 2025\nThe Chromatic is currently the most accurate way to replay Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, with the added benefit of a backlit IPS LCD screen and other modern amenities like video out via USB-C. That IPS screen replicates the colors found on Nintendo\u2019s original handheld. While there are other FPGA mod kits available for DIY enthusiasts like this one from FunnyPlaying, your only other option for a similar complete system to play your old Game Boy cartridges is the $220 Analogue Pocket. It\u2019s a fellow FPGA emulation device with a four-button layout that is also compatible with Game Boy Advance titles and other non-Nintendo games like Sega Game Gear with additional add-ons. While Analogue has done several limited edition colorways before, it\u2019s currently only available in black or white. In the last few months, Analogue seemingly managed to overcome chronic stock issues, so at least for now, buyers have a choice.\nGrabbing your stash of Game Boy games from the attic sounds enticing, until you consider who you\u2019re buying the Chromatic from. With one hand, Luckey promotes his retro gaming venture\u2014a continuation of his early days as a handheld modder. With the other, he\u2019s turning his military weapons maker, Anduril, into one of the government\u2019s de facto suppliers of cutting-edge military technology. Lately, Anduril took Microsoft\u2019s place making XR goggles for troops on the ground, and he even partnered up with once-friend, then-enemy, now-friend again Mark Zuckerberg to craft the XR device for the U.S. military\u2019s future soldiers. Beyond his overtures to his nerdy past, Luckey sees the world in stark lines. He has said in past interviews his goal is to supply enough weapons to act as a kind of deterrent against aggression toward U.S. interests. This kind of \u201cgame theory\u201d isn\u2019t what most gamers love most about their pastime, but it\u2019s intrinsic to how Luckey views his other, non-Game Boy-related business interests.\nHow to compartmentalize Luckey\u2019s businesses is up to each individual buyer, but I personally can\u2019t advocate supporting the arms dealer no matter how innocent this venture seems. You already have an incredible number of software emulation-focused devices available\u2014including sub-$100 handhelds like the Anbernic RG34XXSP or TrimUI Brick\u2014so buyers are not starved for options. Luckey has suggested he\u2019ll launch a Game Boy Advance-like device and Nintendo 64 emulator in the future, but when those hit the scene, we\u2019ll still have the same reservations, all to do with Luckey himself."

      "text": "Nothing recently launched its first-ever open-ear buds, the Nothing Ear (Open), which retails for $150. As the company\u2019s debut open-ear buds, they\u2019re not too bad. Sure, there were things Nothing could have done better, but the fact that I\u2019ve been alternating between just these and the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 for the past couple of weeks (even outside of my review window) is clearly a good sign.\nMy experience with the Nothing Ear (Open) has mostly been about convenience and reliability rather than sound. I\u2019ve turned to these more for on-the-go usage, which is more than half of my earbud usage in general. These have also been my podcast and long catching-up calls buds while doing chores around the house, which means they\u2019ve undergone a fair amount of dust and splashes of water.\nThe sound on these buds was far from the star of the show for me. The buds\u2019 fit worsened the situation, owing to a lot of sound leakage and an overall loose design. It\u2019s nothing that\u2019s too unpleasant to put up with, but it\u2019s not even close to what an audiophile would want out of their buds.\nNothing Ear (Open)\nSince they're so comfortable, it's a bummer their loose fit leads to extensive audio leakage and, consequently, underwhelming sound.\nPros\n- Very comfortable to wear for extended periods\n- Easily navigable onboard volume controls\n- Battery lasts a week\n- Endures light water splashes well\n- Can connect to two devices simultaneously\nCons\n- Pinch button is inconvenient to use\n- Loose fit\n- Average sound due to the poor fit and sound leakage\nNothing Ear (Open) Review: Design\nNothing claims the case for the Nothing Buds is the slimmest on the market at just 19mm and 62.4 grams. I\u2019m not sure if slimmer cases exist, but this one\u2019s definitely up there in the most inconspicuous cases I have ever come across. It easily slid into the tiny pocket outside my tote bag and in my jeans\u2019 front pockets. The buds weigh 8.1g each which is heavy for regular in-ear buds but not bad for running buds with bands that go over your ears.\nThe buds are housed in transparent casing, typical of Nothing products, like the Nothing Phone 2a, with a gorgeous transparent enclosure. They\u2019re marked with colored dots that are color-coded with their respective sockets in the case, which makes docking them much less of a hassle. The buds are all plastic, with aluminum bulbs at the end, and silicone bands that go over your ears but never pull at your hair.\nNothing Ear (Open) Review: Controls\nA single button on both buds handles everything, including play/pause (single click), skipping or rewinding songs (double and triple click, respectively), and volume (long tap and hold). A single press also accepts/ends calls. All the controls are customizable on the Nothing X app, though the app is only compatible with iOS and Android. The button is more of a force sensor that you pinch\u2014like the one on the AirPods Pro\u2014except it has its own dedicated space (a little groove of sorts) as a demarcated boundary, so it\u2019s easier to locate it.\nWhile playback is usually handled well on earbuds, I\u2019ve always judged volume controls on a separate scale since they\u2019re mostly complex. On the Nothing Ear (Open), you press and hold the right earbud to turn the volume up and the left bud to turn it down. For most of my review period, I found this control pretty easy to use. The only issue was that, because of the hold gesture, I couldn\u2019t tinker volume as accurately as I would with controls offering precise increments. Sometimes, I\u2019d want to raise the volume by two points, but it would go up by three, which is far from a deal breaker. I was just happy about having easily navigable onboard volume controls.\nThe playback controls on the Nothing Buds are planned perfectly, but the irritating button makes navigating them quite difficult. The button may be easy to locate, but it has extremely short travel, and you often can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s been pressed successfully. I found skipping and rewinding tracks to be the most difficult gesture because of the problematic button. It\u2019s bothersome to use because it doesn\u2019t work like a force sensor does on an AirPods stem, which you can press by bringing your thumb and forefinger together. It has a similar feel and travel, except it\u2019s placed in a position that isn\u2019t navigable by your thumb and forefinger, leading to a weird hybrid between a force sensor and a button.\nNothing Ear (Open) Review: Fit\nI\u2019m an avid hook earbuds user. Cleer\u2019s Arc II are one of my go-to earbuds for podcasts, calls, and music. However, extended periods of wearing them do reveal their weaknesses in terms of weight and form factor. The Nothing Ear (Open) completely changed that for me. I wore these for hours and often forgot that I was wearing them. In fact, when I briefly reverted back to the Cleer Buds during my review, I realized how bulky those were compared to these. The band that goes over your ear on the Nothing Ear (Open) has an almost negligible form factor. It is extremely thin, sleek, and lightweight. Resembling a thin wire, it sits on the top of your ear and protrudes into a small bulb behind your ear. Unlike the one on the Oladance OWS 2, the bulb is as trimmed down and petite as it can be to balance the weight of the part of the bud sitting inside your ear.\nThat said, the thin wire does carry its fair share of cons, too. Since it barely features any weight, it\u2019s easily movable by your hair and glasses. I often accidentally flung one of the buds while fixing my hair and had to constantly readjust every time I pushed my hair behind my ears. I would still prefer these over the Cleer Buds during a run, for instance, since I\u2019m not going to be fixing my hair too often then. I found this ideal for podcasts and calls, as well, because I would rather give my earbuds a quick readjustment every 15 minutes than deal with ear fatigue on slightly heavier hook earbuds.\nHowever, my biggest gripe with the Nothing Ear (Open) was how it sits inside your ear. At its natural position, it would always hang slightly outside of my concha. I always had to manually adjust its fit and tighten the earpiece inside my ears so it would come tightly snug to my ears. A few minutes into the adjustment, though, it would revert to its initial position, dangling slightly outside my ear. I spent most of my review period letting it hang since the band still ensured the buds didn\u2019t completely plop out. It was mostly during podcasts and calls that I would tighten their fit because it\u2019d be difficult to make out people\u2019s voices, and when I\u2019d listen to music around people and didn\u2019t want sound leakage.\nNothing Ear (Open) Review: Sound\nThe Nothing Ear (Open) features 14.2mm dynamic drivers that are considerably bigger than the standard (mostly) eight to 12-inch drivers found on most wireless earbuds this size. Driver size primarily affects bass intensity. However, despite the bumped-up drivers on these, you can\u2019t expect punchy bass on open earbuds. Since they\u2019re not sitting right inside your ear canal and are, instead, lightly resting right outside, they suffer from significant sound leakage that especially manifests itself in poor bass. This is an old issue associated with open earbuds and one that companies are eagerly trying to fix. The new tech used in Shokz\u2019 latest running buds is a great example. Still, I\u2019ve experienced better low-end on similar open earbuds, but the Nothing Ear (Open) had negligible bass due to its extremely loose fit.\nTreble managed to make its way through, and the mids were fairly decent, too. There\u2019s no ANC on these buds, which is a common open earbuds feature, with the latest Apple AirPods 4 being an example of an exception.\nPersonally, I enjoyed the Nothing Ear (Open) more for its convenience, reliability, battery life, and form factor than for its sound. They worked perfectly for podcasts and calls at home since audio quality is less of a demand there, and because I found it easy to wear them for extended periods. But whenever I needed a good music session, I found myself picking up the Pixel Buds Pro 2 lately.\nIt\u2019s annoying that I couldn\u2019t even make these my go-to podcasts and call earbuds because they slightly underperformed outside the house. With loud ambient noise and no ANC, I sometimes couldn\u2019t make out my caller\u2019s voice or would skip a few seconds of my podcast. This was only an issue when the streets became unusually loud or when a firetruck or ambulance would be passing by. I remember pausing my content every time I\u2019d pass by a live music performance at Union Square on my way to work because I knew these buds wouldn\u2019t be able to overpower that, and I\u2019d simply lose a few seconds of my content. With regular outdoor noise, you\u2019ll likely be fine, as I was for most of my review period.\nNothing Ear (Open) Review: Battery and Water Resistance\nYou\u2019re looking at about six and eight hours of battery life on the buds (talk time vs. playtime) and 24 or 30 hours on the case. I\u2019ve been using the Nothing Ear (Open) for a few weeks for podcasts, calls, and music and have only had to charge them once on the weekends. Talk time drains the battery much faster than music, and I\u2019m on the phone a lot, so the battery life has been really impressive so far. During my entire weeks-long review period, I found them ready with juice every single time I reached for them.\nA solid red light indicates a low charge, a blinking white light shows the buds are being charged, and a solid white light means they\u2019ve been fully charged. They recharge in less than an hour and do not support wireless charging.\nThe Nothing Ear (Open) offers multipoint connectivity for up to two devices, which means they can connect to any two of your devices (phone and laptop, for instance) at the same time. With an IP54 dust and water rating on the buds, I wouldn\u2019t take them in the shower but would be pretty comfortable using them around the pool. I used them with dripping wet hands in the kitchen often and in the washroom around the sink, and they\u2019ve been holding up pretty fine so far.\nNothing Ear (Open) Review: Verdict\nI developed a weird love-hate relationship with the Nothing Ear (Open). They\u2019re so light and comfortable to wear for extended periods that I barely took them off throughout my review window, but whenever I\u2019d sit at Washington Square Park after work to unwind with some good music, these wouldn\u2019t be my buds of preference. I liked that these buds catered to my fast, busy life. They offer easily navigable onboard volume controls, a battery that lasts days, and impressive endurance against water and dust. But they couldn\u2019t deliver an enjoyable music experience. This was mainly because of their poor fit coupled with the on-ear design. I see myself using these as chores earbuds, the handy go-to device you reach out for when you need to quickly listen to something to accompany your cooking."

      "text": "What\u2019s so special about the OnePlus 13? Not much beyond its massive battery pack. That\u2019s one reason to consider the OnePlus 13, but that would mean ignoring other core features that Samsung and Google do better for around the same price. The truth is, there\u2019s nothing special about the OnePlus 13. It just is.\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s not a stable choice for your daily carry. But you\u2019ll miss out on what everyone else is up to, like digital lenses that look far away and a design that exudes personality. The circular camera system on the back loudly signifies you\u2019re carrying a OnePlus device, but what does that mean when Google and Samsung\u2019s backsides carry more cachet? You have to have something special to stand out, and with great-but-average camera performance and an interface that\u2019s overwhelming to navigate, OnePlus isn\u2019t doing much to make heads turn.\nPros\n- Long battery life\n- It's so water resistant you can throw it in the wash\n- Fast charging\nCons\n- It runs on its own update schedule\n- Fast charging is proprietary\n- There's nothing exciting besides the giant battery\n1) Design\nLooking at the OnePlus 13, I feel like I\u2019ve written about this phone a few times already. The design looks similar to the OnePlus 11 and the OnePlus 12, except for some slight differences. The phone comes in three colors: Artic Dawn, Midnight Ocean, which has a \u201cvegan\u201d leather back, and Black Eclipse, which you see here. The large circular camera bump contrasts the backside\u2019s brushed \u201cgrain-glass\u201d design. The bump houses a 50-MP primary camera, a 50-MP telephoto with up to 3x optical zoom, and a 50-MP ultrawide.\nThe OnePlus 13 is the brand\u2019s first truly water-resistant smartphone. It is IP69 rated, which means it is protected against the standard dunk in water for up to half an hour and can withstand the pressure of water jets and water temperatures of up to 80 degrees Celsius. It\u2019s good news for people with hot tubs. OnePlus claims you can sanitize the OnePlus 13 in the dishwasher if the setting isn\u2019t hot. Of course, I want to try this out. But I didn\u2019t for this review. (My buddy, Jason Howell, did the deed over on YouTube. The phone still works for him, so.)\nThe edges on this generation\u2019s OnePlus 13 are much squarer than before. They\u2019re sharper than those on Apple\u2019s iPhone, the Google Pixel 9, and, soon, Samsung. But not OnePlus. It marches to the beat of its own square motif.\nThe OnePlus 13 comes with a 6.82-inch 2K display. The company makes a big to-do about its score with DisplayMate, and in the realm of pixels-per-inch, maximum brightness, and color gamut, the OnePlus 13 performs well. But I\u2019m only mentioning this because it was mentioned in my briefing. The average person won\u2019t be able to immediately tell the difference in color accuracy between this phone and the Pixel 9 Pro\u2019s Super Actua, so that\u2019s good news for everybody.\nI am shuffling between smaller devices with a sub-6.3-inch screen, so the OnePlus 13\u2019s larger size feels gigantic in comparison. The only thing that helps me hold it is the MagSafe-compatible case that OnePlus sells, which I can use with various PopSocket accessories. The bigger phone does get you a 6,000 mAh battery pack, which is what this phone is all about.\n2) Battery Life\nThe battery lasts a long time. After six days off the charger, it still hovers around 22%. This is with Pok\u00e9mon Go constantly blaring in the background so I can log on to Community Day. I also watched several live YouTube performances to kill the battery and edited some videos for future meme posting. I\u2019ve been using Google Chat exclusively on this phone, letting it buzz the OnePlus 13 whenever I get a message.\nI still have to run the phone through Gizmodo\u2019s complete battery benchmark to see how its bigger battery pack performs against the iPhone 16 Pro, the reigning champion on this website. I don\u2019t think it will because Apple\u2019s hardware is on lockdown, though OnePlus\u2019s performance has been promising. I\u2019ll update this section when it\u2019s finished.\nLike its predecessor, the big get on the OnePlus 13 is that it supports 100W fast charging as long as you use the proprietary red charging cable and charging brick that allows for such speeds. OnePlus promises a full battery in 36 minutes with this method compared to the iPhone 16 Pro\u2019s two hours. But that\u2019s if you have all the proper accouterments; otherwise, the OnePlus 13 charges like everyone else. I got the phone down to 13% before I charged it with a general 30w charger. It took only an hour to replenish.\n3) Software\nI don\u2019t like the stylings of OxygenOS 13, not since Oppo has taken the helm from OnePlus. OxygenOS used to resemble stock Android closely, but now it looks like a mix of what it once was and what ColorOS is now on Oppo devices overseas, which is Oppo\u2019s version of iOS slapped on top of Android\u2019s menu screens. The stock Android bones are still on the OnePlus 13, but you must move carefully through the interface to avoid accidentally turning something on, like the split Quick Settings menu. This will split your notification shade and quick settings into two, so you\u2019ll have to aggressively drag down from either left or right to access either/or. I don\u2019t like change, especially in gestures, so I stick with Classic mode: One pull-down for the Quick Settings and another for everything else.\nOnePlus offers some iOS-like stylings if you want to make your own wallpaper or change the look of the icons. You can even download icon packs from the Play Store for more customization. While this is nice, it is not the reason to buy this device. However, it sets the tone for what OnePlus is; it\u2019s still very much a device that caters to a particular niche crowd, and I can appreciate its gumption. However, I still miss the old OnePlus UI.\n4) Camera\nThe OnePlus 13 is a great camera for people who don\u2019t want to think about anything before posting to the internet. I also love that there\u2019s a built-in \u201cbeauty mode\u201d in the camera app; I don\u2019t care who knows it. There\u2019s a bit of an action angle to the photos taken with the OnePlus 13, thanks to its primary camera\u2019s 85-degree field of view. The colors are always rich, which bodes well for images of landscapes and people during golden hour. The Pixel 9 Pro\u2019s algorithms are much more tempered in comparison in an attempt to produce a somewhat natural-looking photo.\nI prefer the OnePlus 13\u2019s vivid images, except when they are too much. And then that\u2019s when I had to come to terms with the fact that I\u2019d rather the smartphone produce a photo that I can churn through a filter on a third party to look the way I want it to than produce the image with the filter intact, making it harder to edit after the fact. Sometimes, the OnePlus 13\u2019s camera algorithms are too aggressive, and things look more saturated and yellow-hued than in real life.\nI was pleased with the OnePlus 13\u2019s maximum 3x optical zoom, even though it advertises up to 6x in the camera app. I could see the snow on the mountains about 150 miles away. There is a 120x digital zoom offering if you have the phone on a tripod. I\u2019m waiting for the next Samsung Galaxy Ultra to do a zoom test. That\u2019s where I\u2019m curious to see the disparity.\nOnePlus 13 Review: Verdict\nI didn\u2019t mention much about the internals of the OnePlus 13 because, for most people, it is how it performs as a day-to-day device, not the numbers spit out by a benchmarking suite. As you can imagine, this is a new phone from a brand that makes a new one every year; the OnePlus 13 does my bidding, from chopping up Joost Klein video clips with InShot to catching Pok\u00e9mon in Go\u2014I plan to use it to run the game the next month or so since it\u2019s packed with extra memory. It runs on the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and offers up to 16GB of memory with a maximum of 512GB of storage, the variant that OnePlus sent over. This is the first device to launch in the U.S. with the Snapdragon Elite platform, but we\u2019ll have more smartphones to compare to as the year draws on. Feel free to give OnePlus its kudos for being first out of the gate.\nThe OnePlus 13 is worthy of consideration for people sick of Samsung and Google\u2019s race to be the number one Android. But it comes with caveats, the most significant being that you\u2019re not on Google\u2019s timeline for software updates. This may become annoying as Google introduces more Gemini features to the Pixel and the Samsung devices that play nice. But maybe it\u2019s also a selling point for you. At a starting price of $900, you can buy an Android phone that\u2019s about being a smartphone rather than pushing a future based on artificial intelligence. This phone wants to serve the utility, which makes it a solid device, even if nothing about it gets me going the way other flagships do."

      "text": "Remember AirPods? You probably do, because they\u2019re literally everywhere, all the time, but if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s because Apple has seemingly neglected its hyper-popular wireless earbuds for a while now\u2014or it\u2019s at least failed to give us a model that actually counts as an upgrade. While AirPods 4 were released in 2024, the only notable upgrades back then were USB-C charging (hardly groundbreaking) and a new H2 chip that most people will probably overlook. That means the last real upgrade was actually in 2021. Feel old yet? I sure do.\nThat lack of attention is starting to show, too, according to a recent report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), a research firm that follows consumer habits. According to its recent trend report on earbuds, Apple\u2019s share of the Bluetooth audio market is starting to slip. This year, 59% of iPhone owners in its survey say they own AirPods, which is technically up from a year ago but also flat with 2023 levels. On one hand, that\u2019s no surprise given the lack of a major update, but when you couple that with increased competition, things start to get a little tricky. The wireless earbud market, after all, isn\u2019t short of new entrants.\nAnd on top of that competition, Apple also doesn\u2019t have the same level of ecosystem lock on AirPods as it does on the iPhone. While lots of people may never make the switch from their iPhone to an Android device simply because they can\u2019t bear the thought of having to leave Apple\u2019s Messages app and get green-bubbled in perpetuity, AirPods don\u2019t enjoy the same superpower. Any pair of wireless earbuds will work pretty much seamlessly on both Android and iOS, save for some features like hi-res LHDC streaming that are pretty much only for the audiophile niche anyway. That\u2019s all to say that AirPods, unlike the iPhone, are vulnerable, and unless you\u2019re an Apple diehard, you could easily look elsewhere for your earbud needs.\nMore important than the business side of things, though, is the fact that AirPods, in this day and age, just feel a little stagnant, which is a drag for us consumers. While competitors like Nothing are pushing the category forward with unique, colorful design, other competitors are pursuing new form factors like open-ear wireless earbuds, which are better for exercising or riding a bike, given the fact that you can still hear your surroundings. To be honest, the world of wireless earbuds is more vibrant than ever, but Apple\u2019s offerings are still a bit\u2026 pale.\nThe good news is, Apple may be on the precipice of giving us something actually new. As noted by CIRP\u2019s recent report, Apple has been heavily discounting its AirPods, including very deep sales this past Amazon Prime week. That could suggest that Apple is trying to move inventory ahead of a product launch\u2014a product launch that could be in the fall when Apple traditionally announces its new iPhones. On the design side of things, there\u2019s also a chance (a smaller one, to be sure) of a shakeup. With its Liquid Glass redesign, Apple seems to be moving its gadgets in a new visual direction. That\u2019s all software for now, but that design language could bleed over into hardware, too. I don\u2019t know what exactly that means for AirPods, if anything, but if there were a time for Apple to try something new from a hardware perspective, now would be that time.\nWhile we can\u2019t say for sure, rumors suggest that Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro 3 could involve major changes, including a dose of AI or even in-earbud cameras of some kind. Those cameras, for the record, wouldn\u2019t be for taking pictures but for enabling gestures or better spatial audio, according to Bloomberg. Whatever Apple does or doesn\u2019t do with its next real upgrade to AirPods, the writing is on the wall: its ridiculously popular earbuds need some love, not just for shareholders, but for faithful lovers of Apple audio."

      "text": "Not everyone is an audiophile, and that\u2019s okay. But once you\u2019ve seen (or heard, I guess) the light of getting a little bit more than usual, it\u2019s hard to go back. So what exactly is \u201ca little bit more\u201d when it comes to wireless earbuds? It\u2019s not always easy to identify, but you\u2019ll know it when you hear it, and the OnePlus Buds 4, while not looking like it on the surface, are definitely delivering that something extra.\nSpeaking of looks, let\u2019s start there. If minimalism is your thing, you\u2019ll find nothing to gripe about when it comes to the $130 OnePlus Buds 4. The pair I was sent is \u201cStorm Gray,\u201d which is to say, uh, gray. I prefer the shape of the case over the OnePlus Buds 3, which evolves from a pillow-like rectangle into an oval-ish egg shape. The gray also has a gunmetal-like finish to it, which, despite not being flashy in any way, is a nice touch. The buds themselves are\u2026 earbuds. There\u2019s a medium-long stem, and, in general, they look as though they\u2019re designed not to call a lot of attention to themselves. And if we\u2019re taking the messaging from OnePlus at face value, which is the only value to take it at, that\u2019s exactly what they are. They\u2019re minimalist buds that fade into the background instead of making a statement.\nOnePlus Buds 4\nNothing special outside, but better than average sound for the price.\nPros\n- Big bass\n- Great ear-tuning test\n- Solid active noise cancellation\nCons\n- Boring design\n- No standout features\nThe good news is that whatever these wireless buds lack in design, they more than make up for in the way they sound. The OnePlus Buds 4 delivers an above-average listening experience and are priced competitively against comparable pairs of earbuds like those made by Nothing. Sound-wise, they also feel like a step up from the OnePlus Buds 3, especially when it comes to bass\u2014a surprising strong suit of the OnePlus Buds 4. Though some bassy earbuds can sound over-simulated to a degree, I found that the OnePlus Buds 4 deliver a more natural-sounding low end, especially when you couple them with OnePlus\u2019 \u201cGolden Sound\u201d listening test that can assess both your ear canal and your particular hearing levels and then tailor the sound of the earbuds to you personally. TV Girl\u2019s \u201cFauxllennium\u201d has been my testing song of choice as of late, and after I used Golden Sound to tune the buds to my specific hearing, I was able to hear mids and highs much better amid the bass and low end. It\u2019s not that it was muddy with the out-of-box balanced tuning, but there\u2019s no beating having each frequency tailored to your ears.\nThis type of personalized tuning technology isn\u2019t unique to OnePlus\u2019 buds. A few years ago, Nothing partnered with a company called Mimi that brings a similar sound profile experience to the Nothing X companion app. The whole process is very similar to Golden Sound and can tailor the audio tuning to the frequencies you hear (and don\u2019t hear). OnePlus\u2019 version works just a little bit better. I noticed a fairly drastic difference in my satisfaction with the sound after taking OnePlus\u2019 hearing test. Such a big difference, in fact, that I would go as far as to consider Golden Sound mandatory if you\u2019re buying these buds. No, really, if you don\u2019t take this hearing test, you\u2019re leaving money on the table.\nWhether you prefer the OnePlus Buds 4 audio tuning over competitors like the Nothing Ear will largely depend on preference. Out of the box, I find the OnePlus Buds 4 and their 11mm ceramic-metal diaphragm woofer definitely deliver a more bass-forward experience, but that can also be adjusted in the HeyMelody app by choosing presets and even adjusting the level of \u201cBassWave,\u201d a feature that dynamically boosts bass depending on the song. Again, the same can be said for competitors like the Nothing Ear and Ear A, which both have preset and granular EQ. Speaking of the HeyMelody app, you should give that a download if you choose to pull the trigger on the OnePlus Buds 4 since that\u2019s where you\u2019ll activate other features like low-latency mode, which is ideal for gaming, and OnePlus 3D audio, which is OnePlus\u2019 equivalent to Apple\u2019s \u201cSpatial Audio\u201d and can change how playback sounds depending on how you tilt your head.\nWhen it comes to active noise cancellation (ANC), these buds hold their own. The OnePlus Buds 4 can cancel up to 55 decibels (dB) with a frequency range of up to 5,500Hz. That gives them a slight edge over the Nothing Ear in this case, which has a max cancellation of 45 dB. That\u2019s a solid amount more on paper, but I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t find that the actual experience of using 10 more dB of noise cancellation is really that noticeable. Turning ANC on and off, however, is. Unlike newer wireless earbuds made by Nothing, the OnePlus Buds 4 use touch controls instead of squeeze controls. That means when you want to turn ANC on or off straight from the earbuds, you simply hold your finger on the outside of either earbud for a couple of seconds. Likewise, if you want to quickly adjust the volume without pulling out your phone, you can swipe up or down to turn it up or down, respectively. Swipe versus squeeze controls are mostly a matter of preference, and I\u2019m always going to be more of a swipe guy, so for me, the swipe controls\u2014which work well, by the way\u2014are a point for OnePlus.\nThose swipe controls were previously only available in flagship \u201cPro\u201d buds, by the way, but OnePlus has trickled them down to the standard version this time around. And speaking of other OnePlus products, if you have a OnePlus phone, you can also take advantage of a couple of exclusive features, including a way to trigger AI translation from the earbuds and one called \u201csteady connect\u201d that increases the Bluetooth range to 250 meters. OnePlus says it\u2019s effective even across multiple walls, which is great if you live in a mansion and never want to hear your kids screaming at each other while playing Mario Kart.\nBattery-wise, there\u2019s nothing major to report here. OnePlus says the buds will get six hours of playback with ANC on at 50 percent volume, which is a bit better than the Nothing Ear, which are rated for 5.2 hours of ANC playback. I\u2019ve been using the OnePlus Buds 4 for about a week, and those battery estimates seem about right, though I think I\u2019m probably averaging over 50 percent volume on a day-to-day basis. Sorry, my own ears, but the subway needs to be drowned out, okay? Another nice perk is that these buds do allow for fast charging. According to OnePlus, you can get 3.5 hours of playback on your earbuds in just 10 minutes with a fast charge. Including the case, that equates to 11 hours.\nYou may be reading this and thinking, so what\u2019s the real difference between the OnePlus Buds 4 and other earbuds? The answer? You. You\u2019re the main difference. While there are variations between the OnePlus Buds 4 and similarly priced buds, it\u2019s the intangibles that will likely sway you one way or another. For instance, maybe you\u2019re in search of a pair of buds that will blend in with any fit you put on, and their very minimalist design is exactly what you need. Or maybe you like the look of competitors like Nothing Ear wireless earbuds, but you don\u2019t think the aesthetic is worth the $20 premium. No matter what your preference is, though, there\u2019s one thing you can be sure of\u2014the OnePlus Buds 4 are a solid pair of wireless earbuds for the price. That\u2019s not a proposition that will appeal to someone who\u2019s in search of something unique, but for someone who just needs earbuds in an accessible price range with a certain level of quality, that\u2019ll be good enough."

      "url": "https://gizmodo.com/its-time-to-stop-sleeping-on-your-earbuds-companion-app-2000632104",
      "text": "There\u2019s an app for everything. For tracking how many steps you take in a day; for watching your cat get into mischief while you\u2019re at work; for drowning your friends in a constant stream of memes they\u2019ll never look at. The list goes on, and, naturally, that very long list includes your wireless earbuds/headphones. Audio companion apps aren\u2019t necessarily new\u2014they\u2019ve been around for a few years now\u2014but they might as well be for most people who own Bluetooth earbuds or headphones.\nAnd, you know what? I can\u2019t say I blame anyone who doesn\u2019t use or even know about their earbuds\u2019 corresponding app. I am firmly in the camp of having way too many apps on my phone as it is, and the idea of adding one more feels absurd at best. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that I need to know what those audio apps do for my job, I probably wouldn\u2019t bother unpacking them, either. But that is what I do for a living, and I have bothered, and I\u2019m here to tell you that you\u2019re missing out.\nDon\u2019t You Dare Say \u201cBloatware\u201d\nThere is an unwieldy world of app bloat out there, but don\u2019t let that fool you when it comes to audio companion apps. If you can stomach adding one more app to your phone, you\u2019ll be rewarded not just with extra features but sometimes with unlocking the true potential of the thing you purchased. One big way audio apps do that is through in-app hearing tests.\nA major part of whether you like a pair of earbuds or headphones has nothing to do with the buds and everything to do with your personal hearing. Depending on your age and whether you spent a lot of time at loud concerts or working in construction, you hear frequencies differently than others. That means, in order to get the best possible sound out of a pair of earbuds or headphones, you need an audio device that tailors the EQ and tuning to your hearing. And on that front, plenty of earbuds can do just that\u2026 with the help of an app, of course.\nTake the OnePlus Buds 4, a pair of earbuds that I recently reviewed. While the buds sound pretty good out of the box, it wasn\u2019t until I bothered to download the OnePlus companion app and went through a short hearing test that I found out how good (exactly) they sound. It wasn\u2019t night and day, but it was a huge improvement over the out-of-box tuning, which proves to me that personalized EQ isn\u2019t just a gimmick. While all personalized EQ apps are a little different, they usually involve some test that plays a sound and then has you submit feedback on whether or not you can hear that sound. Using that profile, audio apps can then augment the frequencies you struggle with to create a fuller sound profile.\nAnd while the OnePlus Buds 4 audio app is the last app I used to do a hearing test, it\u2019s by no means the only one out there. If you\u2019re a fan of Nothing\u2019s earbuds, for example, you can download the Nothing X app and get cracking with that hearing test. Or, if you\u2019re like many people out there and you use AirPods, Apple has its own version of custom EQ (built into iOS and not an app, per se) that it frames more as an accessibility feature. This five-minute hearing test only works with the AirPods Pro 2, though\u2014sorry, literally everyone else.\nBut even if you can\u2019t take advantage of a hearing test provided by an app directly, you can usually choose a custom EQ inside most apps that fits your particular hearing abilities. My recommendation, if your earbuds don\u2019t have a hearing test built in, is to download the Mimi app and have it assess your hearing and then use those recommendations to custom equalize your buds. That\u2019s a lot more involved than the former method, but believe me when I say it is worth the effort.\nSometimes More Is Actually Better\nIf you\u2019re as skeptical of bloatware as I am, you might assume that any additional \u201ccontent\u201d inside your earbuds\u2019 or headphones\u2019 audio apps is absolute garbage, but I\u2019m here to tell you that you may want to give that thought another think. Soundcore was the most recent company to surprise me with its audio companion app offerings, and there is a lot going on in there.\nOne of the coolest features inside Soundcore\u2019s companion app is a whole lot of white noise. For some people, that may be a big shrug, but for those of us who absolutely, positively need white noise of some kind to get to sleep, it\u2019s a veritable paradise. You can choose between white noise sounds with a nature theme like \u201cCampfire Feast\u201d or \u201cOcean Chime,\u201d or even get scientific with \u201cAI Brainwave Audio,\u201d which takes advantage of binaural beats. If you\u2019re not familiar, binaural beats are supposed to trick your brain into hearing certain frequencies that promote focus or relaxation. These are obviously all things you can just search on YouTube if you\u2019re feeling the need to relax or tune out noise, but there\u2019s something to be said about having them all in one place in an app that you got for free (no ad interruptions, either).\nAnd beyond just enjoying free content, having a solid companion app also enables a whole new genre of devices like Soundcore Sleep A30 buds, which extend their battery life to 9 hours by being able to download sounds from their app and play them locally on the buds. Without that app-enabled feature, the earbuds get just 6.5 hours of battery life on a full charge\u2014hardly enough for most people to consider a full night\u2019s sleep. Not everyone will want earbuds to help them sleep, but again, without an app, the people who do want them may have a diminished experience.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s pretty clear that no one requires an app to enjoy listening through a pair of earbuds or headphones, but that doesn\u2019t mean that ignoring them is the right move. The wireless audio market is incredibly saturated in the year of our lord 2025, which makes it annoying when you\u2019re trying to sift through the chum and find out which pair is right for you. On the bright side, it has forced wireless audio companies to find ways of making their earbuds and headphones stand out, and a not-insignificant amount of that effort has gone into apps. If you\u2019re wanting more from your wireless audio, give the apps an ear, because you might just like what you hear."

      "text": "Back in my day, the name of the game when it came to wireless audio was noise cancellation. That\u2019s to say, how much noise can your wireless earbuds possibly block? And sure, active noise-cancellation (ANC) wireless earbuds are probably never going to fall out of vogue entirely, but in recent years, audio companies have recognized that it is, in fact, nice to sometimes be aware of your surroundings. Thus, a market for open earbuds was created.\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with \u201copen earbuds,\u201d as they\u2019ve been marketed, they\u2019re a category of wireless earbuds that\u2014instead of focusing on noise cancellation\u2014actually allow ambient audio to bleed into your Bluetooth audio by design. Why in God\u2019s name would you ever want that, you ask? For lots of reasons, actually. Say you\u2019re biking, for example. On one hand, biking and listening to music is great, but on the other, so is hearing a runaway 18-wheeler barreling in your direction. The same can be said for exercising on foot\u2014being able to hear traffic and pedestrians isn\u2019t just a perk; it could be potentially life-saving, and ANC earbuds don\u2019t exactly allow you to do that. And then there are less morbid perks like comfort.\nAs great as being able to cancel out the screaming baby on an airplane is, sometimes shoving earbuds in your earholes isn\u2019t the most comfortable arrangement for extended use. Open earbuds don\u2019t have that problem. Bose\u2019s Ultra Open Earbuds, for example, are more like a piece of jewelry, with a clip-like design that tucks a speaker behind your ear so that your ear passage remains unblocked. If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re probably skeptical that they could sound even remotely good, but I\u2019ve tried them, and I\u2019m here to tell you that not only are they comfy, but they also sound kind of ridiculously good.\nSee Bose Ultra Open Earbuds at Amazon\nBut what if I told you that\u2014as useful and surprisingly functional as open earbuds are\u2014there\u2019s actually a third category of open audio device that I think is even better, and they do a lot more than just play audio? This device is actually the best pair of open earbuds you can buy, and they\u2019re not even earbuds at all.\nYes, I\u2019m talking (once again) about smart glasses.\nI\u2019ve extolled smart glasses a million times over at this point, but maybe one of the most underrated reasons why I actually like them in their current form is that they function incredibly well as an audio product. I personally use a pair of Meta Ray-Bans almost every day, and while they\u2019re not a solution I opt for 100% of the time, they\u2019re the first ones I grab when I need to actually hear my surroundings. Anyone that I ever convince to listen to Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans is immediately surprised by the quality of audio that they put out. Sure, you\u2019re not going to want to wear them when you\u2019re listening to a podcast on a crowded subway, but if you\u2019re in a non-Armageddon-like noise situation, they work a lot better than you\u2019d think. And with Spotify integration, when Meta\u2019s onboard audio assistant actually hears my commands and understands them, they\u2019re fairly functional, too.\nAnd it\u2019s not just music; there\u2019s arguably a better use for smart glasses as an open-ear audio product, and it\u2019s voice calls. I use my Meta Ray-Bans so much for calls that going back to talking into wireless earbuds (even open-ear ones) feels like a major downgrade. Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans, in my experience, beat out most of the open-ear competition when it comes to calling, not just because the audio you\u2019re receiving sounds good, but because the microphones kind of kick the shit out of earbuds I\u2019ve used.\nAs much as I love Bose\u2019s Ultra Open Earbuds for their sound quality, the microphone on those things is weak at best. Nothing\u2019s Ear Open, which I\u2019ve also used extensively, is a little better, but not exactly great. Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans, however, combine the best of both worlds. People who I\u2019ve called often report that I sound better than usual when I\u2019m taking calls, and the same goes for their voice on my end. Also, being able to walk around and feel completely unencumbered when I\u2019m taking calls is a perk that I didn\u2019t know I needed.\nSee Nothing Ear Open at Amazon\nBut that\u2019s just the audio side of things. Smart glasses, as you may already know, are capable of a lot more than just playing music or taking calls. If you pivot away from open earbuds, you could wind up with a gadget that takes pictures and records video as well. Yes, Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans have AI built in, but having used (or tried to use) Meta AI often, I can\u2019t, with a clean conscience, recommend anyone buy these glasses for AI capabilities. In short, Meta AI is shaky at best when it\u2019s not just downright insubordinate or wrong about stuff. With that caveat out of the way, though, you are getting more than just an audio product in smart glasses, and I\u2019ve got the pics to prove it.\nObviously smart glasses aren\u2019t great in every situation. Right now, my biggest complaint about the Meta Ray-Bans that I own is that they\u2019re tinted, which makes using them indoors (especially in my dark-ass New York apartment) less than ideal. Earbuds obviously don\u2019t have that problem, so point for earbuds here. That could change in the future, though, since an increasing number of smart glasses are incorporating electrochromic lenses that allow you to adjust the tint of your glasses just by pressing a button.\nBut mostly, I just see smart glasses as a better value, especially if you\u2019re considering high-end open earbuds like the aforementioned offering from Bose. Those usually retail for $299, which is the same price as a pair of Ray-Bans from Meta. And yes, the audio quality on Bose\u2019s earbuds is better than Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans, but you\u2019re still getting so much more for the money: a camera, audio, and a pair of sunglasses all in one.\nI know smart glasses aren\u2019t exactly the groundbreaking future product we all want them to be right now, but they are\u2014if you can get past the fact they still have a lot of room to grow\u2014solid for some things that we do in the here and now. And one of those things is listening to stuff. So, if you\u2019re in the market for a pair of earbuds that you can wear while you\u2019re exercising or on a bike, or ones that simply don\u2019t plug your ears up, you may want to buy the best open-ear earbuds of all: smart glasses."

      "text": "Apple released two new AirPods for the first time at its September event for iPhones: AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancelation (ANC) and AirPods 4 without ANC, priced at $180 and $130, respectively. This is also the company\u2019s debut in providing ANC with an open-ear design. It has previously only offered noise cancelation on the in-ear AirPods Pros.\nApart from ANC, the only two features on the high-end AirPods 4 that are absent on the base model are support for wireless charging and a speaker in the case for Find My alerts. I\u2019m assuming most people will pay the extra $50 for ANC, which is why that\u2019s the most important area these were supposed to ace.\nApple AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation\nThe more expensive AirPods 4 suffer from poor battery, a loose fit, and underwhelming noise cancelling.\nPros\n- ANC is effective with low-end sounds\n- Force sensor is easier to navigate than a touch sensor\n- Trimmed charging case for easier portability\n- Features wireless charging\n- Case offers a speaker for Find My alerts\nCons\n- ANC isn't good for high-frequency sounds\n- Short battery life\n- Fit feels loose\n- No onboard volume controls\nWhile they did a great job canceling low-end noise, high-end sounds were barely reduced. Overall, the Pros are far better regarding ANC, owing to their silicone in-ear tips that completely block your ear canals. This isn\u2019t Apple\u2019s fault; it\u2019s just a design feature. But Apple could\u2019ve made up for that by featuring a longer battery life, better onboard controls, and a snugger fit on the AirPods 4.\nApple AirPods 4 With ANC: Design\nThe first feature I noticed on these was how much the charging case has been trimmed down compared to the 2022 AirPods Pros. Shaving off a few centimeters from both ends, the case is significantly less elongated than before\u2014to the point where it\u2019s very close to being a perfect square. The thickness remains unchanged mainly; if anything, it looks stumpier than before.\nAnnoyingly enough, the case for the AirPods 4 no longer sports a lanyard loop, which is a weird update. I\u2019m not sure if this is because the trimmed size could no longer accommodate one, but that\u2019s still an unfair omission for consumers who used it.\nThis is one of those low-key changes that a lot of people didn\u2019t notice, and for some reason, Apple didn\u2019t mention it at the keynote either. The pairing button that was always located behind the case no longer exists. On the AirPods 4, it has been replaced by a touch-capacitive sensor on the front of the case (just under the lid).\nIt works fine and is easy to locate because of the battery status light that\u2019s triggered every time you open the case. However, I would\u2019ve appreciated the company mentioning it on the product page. I pity consumers who are fiddling with the case and wondering where the hell the pairing button went. I would\u2019ve been the first to protest against replacing a physical button with a touch sensor. But it\u2019s only because pairing is a feature I do not use every day, so I\u2019m okay with the transition.\nThe underside of the charging case sports a Type-C port to adhere to the EU\u2019s new rules and a speaker for Find My alerts.\nThe earbuds have also received the same treatment as the case. The stems are stubbier and chunkier, as opposed to the slightly slimmer and longer stems on the Pros. Like the AirPods Pros, they sport an IP54 dust and water rating.\nApple AirPods 4 With ANC: Fit\nI unboxed the AirPods 4 on a sidewalk in Tribeca right after my briefing. As soon as I plugged the buds into my ears, one quickly plopped out and got lost on the sidewalk for a brief moment (it felt way longer) until a kind passerby spotted it and handed it to me. That was my first experience with the AirPods 4, and it was very indicative of what was to follow.\nThey plopped out a couple more times and required constant adjustment throughout my time with them. I remember tightening their fit in my ears before jumping over puddles and holding onto them for dear life while walking over the subway vent.\nThey\u2019d sometimes struggle to catch up to my NYC walking pace and start to get looser slowly, requiring a quick readjustment. Throughout my time with these, I was either fixing their fit or scared they might fall out.\nI wasn\u2019t going in with expectations of in-ear buds\u2019 level of snugness on the AirPods 4; it\u2019s obvious that silicone tips that go inside your ear canals will provide a better fit. But the fit on these buds isn\u2019t just relaxed; it\u2019s loose. Apple has always received complaints about its AirPods\u2019 loose fit and the lack of rubber ear tips in the package.\nSince fit is ultimately dependent on ear size, I\u2019d recommend testing these in person before you make an online purchase. Folks whose ears completely reject in-ear tips due to discomfort or sensitivity may prefer the on-ear design on these. After all, as Apple said in my briefing, this is the entire point of the AirPods 4: giving consumers who aren\u2019t fans of in-ear tips an open-ear ANC option for the first time.\nApple AirPods 4 With ANC: Controls\nUnlike the AirPods Pros, which feature touch sensors, the AirPods 4 have force sensors on their stems. Having a non-touch interface on the stems is great for avoiding accidental taps when you\u2019re just trying to adjust the bud in your ear, which is something you\u2019ll be doing a lot on these AirPods. I also prefer force sensors because of the feedback and tactility they provide. The \u2018click\u2019 sound is pretty reassuring, as opposed to a light tap that runs the risk of not being registered.\nA single press on either bud handles playback, answering/ending calls, and muting/unmuting the mic. In Settings, you can also assign a double-press to some of these gestures. Pressing and holding on each bud can also be customized; you can pick one bud to activate Siri and the other to cycle between ANC modes. All the gestures are pretty intuitive, and the pressing force is fairly adequate, with a decent response time. However, there are no onboard volume controls, which means you have to reach for your source device (phone, laptop, etc.) to tweak the volume. That often felt inconvenient when my phone was away, and I wanted to turn the volume up or down quickly.\nOn iOS 18, you can use head gestures to accept or decline calls on the AirPods 4. Nodding your head yes accepts a call and shaking it no declines it. When I finally tried it out on my coworker\u2019s phone, it became apparent why I didn\u2019t have a demo of this feature at my briefing. Out of the seven times I called, it only read my gestures around three times, and that too, with extremely aggressive nodding and shaking that I would never do in public.\nApple AirPods 4 With ANC: Sound and ANC\nApple makes a bunch of promises about the sound of the AirPods 4. It has high hopes from its H2 chip that also powers the AirPods Pros. While the sound is good, like it is on the Pros, it isn\u2019t anything especially worth shelling out $180 for. It features the \u201ccrisp highs\u201d Apple has been touting, but the \u201cdeep lows\u201d aren\u2019t very noticeable. The mids carry sufficient space, but I would\u2019ve liked more separation among the elements if I were going into these solely for their sound. If you\u2019re sure about going for these AirPods, you\u2019ll likely be okay with their sound profile, but this shouldn\u2019t be the only reason you\u2019d buy them. The audio sounds less immersive than on the Pros because of the on-ear design, which is less Apple\u2019s fault and more Physics. Either way, you\u2019ll have to make this tradeoff if you want an on-ear pair of buds.\nSpending two days with these AirPods made me realize why my ANC briefing was done with highly low-end airplane white noise. That\u2019s the only thing the buds are good at. Cancelation for the rest of the frequencies is painfully average.\nI was impressed by how much they muted car engines and the subway rumbling below. But high-frequency sounds such as car horns or people\u2019s conversations passed through. Most ANC modes are ineffective against high-end sounds such as horns or sirens, but I\u2019ve seen similarly priced or cheaper buds do at least a much better job.\nWhile lunching at Naya, the low-end HVAC system was silenced entirely, but the POS system\u2019s loud, irritating beeps passed through. I cycled between ANC and Transparency modes to compare the noise reduction for the beeping, and there was barely any difference.\nAgain, the culprit is the on-ear design. Plastic tips resting on the edge of your ear canals will leave gaps for noise to seep through, compared to in-ear silicone tips that completely block the passage. Silicone also absorbs some of the sounds that plastic is unproductive against.\nThis won\u2019t help placate a customer who paid an extra $50 specifically for ANC, and the fact that the AirPods Pros feature far better ANC for just an extra $10 makes these buds even more worthless. If I don\u2019t care about ANC, I\u2019d go for the $130 variant; if I do, I\u2019d buy the $190 AirPods Pros. I asked Apple about this, and they agreed and said, \u201cThe ANC AirPods 4 specifically cater to people looking for noise cancelation on an open-ear design.\u201d Even if that means the ANC is sub-standard.\nThere\u2019s also a transparency mode that I really like. Transparency modes involve creating some \u2018fake noise\u2019, which often makes them sound overdone, with every ambient sound excessively exaggerated. The one on these AirPods is quite decent and helps fulfill its purpose of keeping you aware of your surroundings. The ANC can be set to Adaptive, which means it\u2019ll automatically go up and down to match the volume of your space. You also get Conversation Awareness, meaning your content\u2019s volume will automatically be lowered when you start talking to someone and raise back up as soon as you\u2019re done. It was funny the first time I sang along to a song on these AirPods, and I wondered for 30 seconds why the volume suddenly went down. You can easily turn Conversation Awareness off in Settings, which I ended up doing so I can sing along easily.\nApple AirPods 4 With ANC: Battery Life\nThe battery life is astonishingly low. You get just four hours with ANC and an extra hour with it off. With the case, the buds total 20 hours with ANC and 30 hours with it off. If I\u2019m shelling out an extra $50 for the ANC variant, it\u2019s a feature I most likely use quite often. So, I\u2019m more concerned about the \u2018with ANC on\u2019 scores on these. For context, the $60 CMF Buds Pro 2 lasts 6.5 hours with ANC at a fraction of the AirPods 4\u2019s price. Google\u2019s $200 Pixel Buds Pro, now $140, last seven and 11 hours with ANC on and off, respectively. The $100 OnePlus Buds 3 score is six and 10 hours, respectively, and their charging case can last 28 or 44 hours, depending on ANC.\nI fully charged these, used them on and off in the office for around an hour or two, and then during a quick 30-minute lunch at Naya. Upon returning, they were already flashing red. They still squeezed out a little more than an hour after that, but it sucks to see your earbuds on red so soon after you spend just under an hour charging them.\nI\u2019m plugged into my earbuds for a good chunk of the day, which involves a mix of music and podcasts and a long, at least one-hour call per day. With this level of usage and ANC, I can imagine these lasting under four hours since talk time drains the earbud battery faster than playtime. This means I will probably plug these into a socket every night, which is the last thing I want from my earbuds.\nThe ANC variant offers wireless charging, allowing you to use any Apple Watch or Qi charger. The AirPods Pro supported MagSafe charging, which has been removed from AirPods 4. Rumors speculated that the shrunken charging case could no longer facilitate that, but I confirmed with Apple at the private briefing, and they refuted that assumption.\nThe case uses five minutes of quick charging to provide the buds with enough juice for 45 minutes to an hour, but the case doesn\u2019t offer quick charging capabilities on its own, which is a bummer at this price point.\nApple AirPods 4 With ANC: Verdict\nI can\u2019t find a good enough use case for the AirPods 4. If ANC is my top priority, I\u2019d go for the AirPods Pros that do it way better for just an extra $10. If I don\u2019t care about ANC, I\u2019d opt for the $130 non-ANC variant to save my bucks and stay within the Apple ecosystem.\nThe only way I can justify the AirPods 4 is if you\u2019re specifically looking for ANC that\u2019s effective against low-end noise (airplane\u2019s rumble, washing machine\u2019s/dishwasher\u2019s/window AC\u2019s hum) on an open-ear design. And that\u2019s a pretty specific use case to recommend these. If you\u2019re indifferent to the ear tip design, there\u2019s no reason you should compromise on several features of the AirPods 4.\nI appreciate other small adjustments, such as the touch sensors on the Pros being replaced by the force sensors on these, but again, I\u2019m not going to celebrate that when I have bigger issues to worry about, like a case that\u2019s always flashing red because of a four-hour battery life and having to reach for my phone every now and then because there are no onboard volume controls. There are plenty of reasons to not opt for these and very specific reasons to go for them."

      "text": "There are a lot of wireless earbuds in the world today. In fact, at this exact moment, there are no less than (count \u2019em) three pairs in my coat pocket right now as I type these words. That\u2019s a lot of earbuds for one person to have, and that figure only becomes even more ridiculous when you consider all three pairs of said wireless earbuds are from one single company\u2014and they were all released at the same time.\nThat company in question is CMF, which is a sub-brand of the audio-turned-phone company, Nothing. Last month CMF released three different pairs of wireless earbuds\u2014the Buds 2a, the Buds 2, and the Buds 2 Plus. If you\u2019re saying to yourself, \u201cthat seems excessive,\u201d then I\u2019m in agreement with you, but hold your judgment until the end because things are about to get even more complicated.\nAll three of those wireless earbuds have different prices; all three of them have different levels of active noise cancellation (ANC); and all three of them have different drivers. That means, as you\u2019re about to learn, all three of them deliver a different listening experience, and that means you ought to know what you\u2019re getting into before you roll the dice and purchase a pair. But where do you start? Spec sheets are helpful, but they only bring you so far. It\u2019s the experience of using them\u2014the real discernible one that decibels on a chart might not portray\u2014that really matters. If only there were someone who spent time trying all three to tell you just which pair you need and which you can potentially forget\u2026\nCMF by Nothing Buds 2 Plus\nThe CMF Buds 2 Plus may be the most expensive of the pack, but they're still the most bang for the buck. Trust me, you'll hear the difference\u2014I sure did.\nPros\n- Robust bass\n- Good dynamic range\n- Affordable\nCons\n- No orange color\n- Similar sound to Buds 2 at times\nIn case you didn\u2019t get my not-so-subtle hint, I tried all three of CMF\u2019s new pairs of wireless earbuds to bring you the answer to your burning question: which pair of Buds 2 should you get? The answer may not surprise you, but before we get to my experience and comparison, let\u2019s start at the beginning. What\u2019s going on with these wireless earbuds?\nFirst, at the lowest end, there\u2019s the Buds 2a, which I got in this appealing orange color that the 2 Plus unfortunately does not come in. Naturally, these wireless earbuds have the lowest level of everything in the spec department, and they also have the lowest price. The Buds 2a have 42 decibels of noise cancellation, a 12.4 mm Bio-fiber driver, and 5 hours of battery life with ANC on and 8 hours with ANC off. They retail at a very reasonable price of $49.\nThen, there\u2019s the middle child: the Buds 2, which, if you\u2019ve been following along, have slightly elevated specs and a slightly higher price, though there\u2019s actually one big caveat on that front that I\u2019ll get to in a moment. The Buds 2 have 48 decibels of noise cancellation, 11mm PMI drivers enhanced by Dirac Opteo\u2019s tuning, and 7.5 hours of battery life with ANC on and 13.5 hours with ANC off. Here\u2019s where things get interesting; they usually retail at a $10 premium compared to the Buds 2a (that\u2019s $59), but as of this writing, they\u2019re $10 off, which makes them the same price of $49.\nFinally, there\u2019s the Buds 2 Plus, which are the proverbial cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of CMF by Nothing\u2019s most recent lineup (forgetting the Buds 2 Pro that came out last year for a moment) that have\u2014say it with me now\u2014the highest price tag. The Buds 2 Plus have 50 decibels of adaptive noise cancellation (only slightly higher than the Buds 2 but with a 5400Hz frequency range as opposed to the former\u2019s 5200Hz range), a 12 mm liquid crystal polymer driver, and 7.5 hours of ANC playback out of the case and 14 hours of non-ANC playback. They, as I alluded to, are the most expensive of the three pairs at $69.\nOkay, got all that? Stay with me, now! The lineup, with its similar names, looks, and slight variations in features and price, is confusing, and there\u2019s no way of getting around that. Don\u2019t worry, though, for everyone\u2019s sake (myself included), we\u2019re going to put all of that aside for a moment and get down to brass tacks: what do these things actually sound like? On that front, I\u2019ve got good news and bad news.\nI\u2019ve been using CMF\u2019s budget wireless buds for the past couple of weeks, and I honestly didn\u2019t know what to expect. Sometimes you really get what you pay for (see: this scrappy but frankly bad pair of pocket-sized earbuds I reviewed from Jlabs) and sometimes the cheapest option is actually the best (see: Nothing\u2019s Ear (a) wireless earbuds). Because of that variability, I came into the trio of CMF wireless buds with an open mind, but ultimately, I was surprised at what I found.\nAs a test, I listened to the same song (My Bloody Valentine\u2019s \u201cOnly Shallow\u201d) with each pair, back-to-back-to-back, and under the same conditions\u2014a fairly quiet area of the Gizmodo office. Starting first with the highest-end pair, the Buds 2 Plus, I worked my way down until I hit the Buds 2a.\nSo let\u2019s start from the top: the CMF Buds 2 Plus sound great. There\u2019s dynamic range, and the noise cancellation, though not world-class, is solid enough for your subway commute (an environment that I also tested all three buds in). Frankly, I think they\u2019re almost as nice as Nothing\u2019s Ear (a), which is probably my favorite pair of Nothing wireless earbuds for the value and design. All in all, I\u2019m a fan of the CMF Buds 2 Plus. I wouldn\u2019t choose them as my \u201cdaily driver,\u201d so to speak, just because I love the ceramic driver on Nothing\u2019s Ear wireless earbuds more and their transparent design, but if I were forced to use them, I wouldn\u2019t be mad about the quality.\nNext, I tried the CMF Buds 2, the middle child, which, while pleasant, didn\u2019t quite sing like the Buds 2 Plus. They do an equally good job of simulating bass, but they definitely are a little muddier compared to their premium-priced counterparts. ANC, as I suspected, based on the level of noise cancellation stated in CMF\u2019s spec sheets, was about the same as the 2 Plus, which is nice, but if you\u2019re looking for the highest fidelity, the 2 Plus wins this round.\nThen there\u2019s the baby\u2014the CMF Buds 2a. This is where I noticed the biggest dropoff. While the price is very approachable, these buds sound by far the tinniest out of the lineup and bring the lowest level of noise cancellation. It was harder to notice when I was testing the wireless buds anecdotally and randomly on my morning commute, but I\u2019m not a big fan of the dynamic range or the noise cancellation on the Buds 2a. I\u2019d say you get what you pay for, but these buds now cost the same as the Buds 2, and the midrange pair are leaps and bounds better.\nSo, those are unscientific conclusions. In this case, the Buds 2 Plus justify the premium price, and while the Buds 2 are serviceable, they definitely don\u2019t deliver the same quality. You can forget all about the Buds 2a because they don\u2019t deliver anywhere near the sound quality of the Buds 2, which are now the same damn price. But just to be sure I wasn\u2019t letting the knowledge of price affect my judgment, I did a blind test to see if I could really hear the difference, and mostly my impressions remained the same.\nIn a blindfolded listening test, I was able to identify the three different wireless buds correctly six times in a row on two different styles of songs (rock and hip-hop), though there are some frequencies where the difference is harder to notice, like more \u201ccinematic\u201d music with fewer frequencies to keep track of. The Buds 2a are a dead giveaway with their tinny, almost hollow sound, and the Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus are definitely harder to differentiate but still have enough tells in most genres\u2014the Buds 2 Plus typically have better bass and a fuller sound profile.\nWhile I don\u2019t love to be upsold on anything, sometimes in this world, you get what you pay for, and the CMF wireless earbuds are no different. My advice is, if you can afford the $20 premium over the Buds 2 and Buds 2a, then you should pay it\u2014get the Buds 2 Plus. There\u2019s not much difference from an ANC perspective, but from sheer sound quality, the Buds 2 Plus earn their premium-sounding name, and they\u2019re still (if we\u2019re in the spirit of comparing) $50 cheaper than the Nothing Ear and $10 cheaper than the Ear (a)."

      "text": "Sometimes, picking a pair of headphones feels like an impossible choice. There are lots to choose from, and the barrier to entry is enough to send haptic chills down one\u2019s spine. If there\u2019s one thing that most can agree on, it\u2019s that Apple\u2019s AirPods Max are probably the standard for people considering headphones in the U.S., especially if you already own an iPhone. But AirPods Max are so damn expensive, right? Is it worth shelling out $550 for a pair of headphones when competitors like Nothing\u2019s $300 Headphone 1 exist and offer good-looking AirPods alternatives for a price that undercuts Apple by $250?\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack in that question, but luckily, I\u2019ve tested both for you (and a lot of other audio products) and can offer my sage guidance on where to throw hundreds of dollars if you need to save yourself from the scourge of subway sounds or your neighbor\u2019s incessant singing. First, let\u2019s start with the looks.\nSee Nothing Headphone 1 at Amazon\nHeadphone 1 vs. AirPods Max: Design\nAt the risk of pointing out the obvious: AirPods Max and Nothing\u2019s Headphone 1 look very different. While Apple\u2019s super-popular headphones opt for a minimalist design, Nothing\u2019s Headphone 1 have a retro-inspired look that riffs on cassette tapes of yore. Undoubtedly, you\u2019ll have your own thoughts on which looks better\u2014these things are subjective after all\u2014but from a more objective standpoint, they also use different materials that make them feel noticeably different.\nAirPods Max, for example, use stainless steel and anodized aluminum, which means two things: they feel more premium, and they\u2019re also a little bit heavier\u2014that\u2019s just physics for you. Nothing\u2019s Headphone 1 wins points for unique style, but they\u2019re made mostly from plastic and a little bit of aluminum so they definitely feel a lot cheaper but are also a lot lighter. Which pair speaks to you is a matter of preference, but if you\u2019re looking for a lighter carry, Nothing\u2019s Headphone 1 has AirPods Max beat: the weight breakdown here is 329g compared to almost 385g.\nNothing\u2019s Headphone 1 also expand on AirPods Max\u2019s hardware with a whole host of physical buttons that include a dedicated track skip/fast-forward/rewind paddle, a volume roller, and an on/off switch. AirPods Max have a crown for volume adjustment and pause/play and that\u2019s it; to the frustration of many, there\u2019s no on/off switch. The number of buttons on the Headphone 1 was a welcome surprise when I tested them out, and while I wish they were a little more refined and less finicky to use, they do set the Headphone 1 apart not just from Apple but from pretty much every brand of over-ear headphones.\nAesthetically, you\u2019ll have to dig deep and figure out what you want out of a pair of headphones. If you want something that\u2019s more of a fashion statement, the Headphone 1 are going to speak to you. If you want something that\u2019s going to fade into the background, then AirPods Max are more your speed. Personally? I find AirPods Max to be a bit on the boring side, but I respect that not everyone cares about looking the part of a Brooklyn-based hipster. I\u2019m opting for the Headphone 1 in this department for feeling lighter on my head and also bringing a design that I find exciting, sleek, and worth writing home about. Sorry, AirPods Max, stainless steel or not, the minimalism thing is a little bit tired.\nWinner: Headphone 1\nHeadphone 1 vs. AirPods Max: Sound\nSure, your eyes may be the first way you judge a pair of headphones, but ultimately, your ears are what really matter. As a result, you\u2019re probably wondering: can Nothing\u2019s Headphone 1 really challenge the AirPods Max in the sound department? The answer is\u2026 to be honest, yes.\nI was pleasantly surprised to find the sound on the Headphone 1\u2014tuned in collaboration with hi-fi audio company KEF\u2014actually held its own against the significantly more expensive and popular AirPods Max. Nothing\u2019s headphones performed particularly well in the low-to-mid-range frequencies, though\u2014sorry, budget seekers\u2014I think Apple\u2019s AirPods Max premium still means something in the audio department.\nAs I wrote in my review, I still think Apple\u2019s AirPods Max have a noticeable edge when it comes to sound. In particular, mids-to-highs have slightly more texture and room, which makes vocals feel more organic and clear. That being said, Nothing holds its own against a competitor that charges a very hefty premium, and the fact that it comes close at all is definitely a feat. Still, better is better, and AirPods Max still feel clearer and more dynamically rich, even if by a close margin.\nWinner: AirPods Max\nHeadphone 1 vs. AirPods Max: Comfort\nA big reason why people buy over-ear headphones is that they may not like sticking earbuds inside their ears, which is fair, because even the most comfortable ear tips will become irritating over time. So, with comfort in mind, you\u2019re probably wondering if AirPods Max feel as luxurious as the materials they\u2019re made out of or, on the other side of the coin, if Nothing\u2019s Headphone 1 feel rougher with less premium materials. At the risk of spoiling the result, this one is almost too close to call.\nOne of the first things that struck me about the Headphone 1 is that they fit my head well, which may not be a selling point for everyone, but for me, a person with a small head, that\u2019s a huge win. Not only was the fit snug, but the vegan leather headstrap and earcups also felt cushy and smooth on my head and ears, respectively. There\u2019s actually a pretty big difference material-wise when it comes to earcups on the AirPods Max, as Apple\u2019s headphones are made with a mesh textile. Those mesh materials are designed to be more breathable than their counterparts, and while I\u2019m not a big cardio guy, I\u2019m willing to bet that they might be highly preferable to someone who wants to wear headphones while exercising.\nAnother major difference is in the head strap, which is a solid piece of plastic with memory foam and vegan leather on the Headphone 1. That\u2019s opposed to AirPods Max, which have a mesh band that achieves a couple key things. First, it helps reduce the weight of the headphones, which have some heft due to the premium materials. Secondly, the mesh band also (similar to the mesh earcups) makes AirPods Max more breathable, giving them an edge for anyone who\u2019s more fitness-focused.\nUltimately, both headphones are comfortable, even despite the weight difference, but I think I\u2019m going to have to give AirPods Max the nod here if just because the materials and design of the earcups and head strap make them more suitable for a wider variety of use cases.\nWinner: AirPods Max\nHeadphone 1 vs. AirPods Max: Battery Life and Features\nBattery life is key in any gadget, but for headphones, that metric feels even more important since running out of juice while you\u2019re on an airplane or commuting to work can be a huge drag. Given the importance of battery life, you\u2019d think that shelling out more money for a premium product gets you more juice as a given, right? Couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\nNothing\u2019s Headphone 1 trounce AirPods Max in the battery life department, delivering up to 35 hours with active noise cancellation (ANC) on as opposed to AirPods Max\u2019s 20 hours. I find those battery life estimates to be accurate in my testing, and if you\u2019re looking for more longevity, the Headphone 1 have an edge.\nBoth pairs of headphones have pretty much all the features you\u2019d expect, including transparency (mixes music and ambient noise), adaptive noise cancellation, and spatial audio. Both headphones also have software-based hearing tests that allow you to customize the EQ of your audio to your specific hearing idiosyncrasies, and can also be custom-tuned either via Nothing\u2019s X app or on iOS for Apple AirPods Max, though Nothing\u2019s is more granular. Both also take advantage of custom hi-res codecs if you\u2019re an audiophile looking for the best, lossless sound, though iOS doesn\u2019t support LHDC (Low Latency High Definition Audio Codec), so you should keep your ecosystem in mind here. I will say AirPods definitely have an advantage if you\u2019re in the Apple ecosystem, since they switch more seamlessly between working on your MacBook or iPhone.\nWhile feature-wise these headphones are pretty much a tie, Nothing gets the nod for having a much longer battery life. It\u2019s hard to argue with not having to worry about charging up your headphones.\nWinner: Headphone 1\nHeadphone 1 vs. AirPods Max: ANC\nA good component of any premium pair of headphones or earbuds is their ability to cancel outside noise, and on that front, Apple\u2019s AirPods Max always get high marks. But just because Apple gets the kudos doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re necessarily that good, right? Wrong.\nAirPods Max do have an edge when it comes to noise cancellation, and while Nothing boasts an impressive 52dB of cancellation, lab tests from Sound Guys show that AirPods Max still beat the Headphone 1 with an impressive 88% noise reduction compared to the Headphone 1\u2019s 85% reduction. Anecdotally, I can notice the difference when switching between the two headphones, and I think it has a lot to do with the earcups. I find AirPods Max\u2019s cups create a tighter seal around my ears, which just naturally blocks out more sound. Apple\u2019s noise-cancellation tech does the rest. If you\u2019re looking for headphones with truly great noise cancellation, Apple\u2019s AirPods Max still get the point here.\nWinner: AirPods Max\nBottom Line\nEveryone has different priorities when it comes to audio, but there are still some categories that are unavoidable. You need your headphones to sound good, of course, but you also need them to fit your head, be comfortable, and block out noise effectively. Apple\u2019s AirPods Max are still some of the best at doing all of those things, but they come with a burdensome premium that might scare a lot of people away. Nothing\u2019s Headphone 1, on the other hand, still excel in those key metrics, and while they fall slightly short in major categories like sound quality and ANC, they also make up for those shortcomings with a cool design, lots of features, and a heck of a lot of buttons.\nIf you have the money and want the best of the best there\u2019s no reason not to go Apple, but I\u2019m a firm believer that Nothing\u2019s Headphone 1 still get you most of the way there, and if you\u2019re a fan of what Nothing is putting down in the design department, you won\u2019t regret saving yourself $250 and going with the underdog."
