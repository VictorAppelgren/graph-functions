  "content": "Many of the artificial intelligence (AI) researchers who joined Meta as part of that company\u2019s high-profile recruiting efforts are reportedly working in a new team called TBD Lab and leading the development of the next version of the large language model (LLM) Llama.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nTBD Lab will work alongside other AI teams in Meta\u2019s recently formed Superintelligence Labs group, helping with new model releases and AI agents, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Thursday (Aug. 7), citing unnamed sources and an internal company memo.\n\nMeta did not immediately reply to PYMNTS\u2019 request for comment.\n\nTBD Lab is overseen by Meta Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang, who joined the company when it bought a $14 billion stake in his former startup, Scale AI, according to the report.\n\nWang wrote in a memo to employees, per the report: \u201cAlready in the past month, I\u2019ve seen meaningful progress in each of these collaborations. This enables us to be more technically ambitious, parallelize across several separate efforts and ultimately achieve frontier results more quickly.\u201d\n\nThe new team includes at least 18 AI researchers poached from OpenAI, a number from Google, and nine Meta employees transferred to TBD Lab from the company\u2019s internal infrastructure teams, according to the report.\n\nMeta has been pursuing an AI-focused hiring spree since at least early June, when it was reported that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was taking a hands-on approach to expanding the company\u2019s artificial general intelligence (AGI) team and was recruiting from a pool of AI researchers and engineers who met with him at his homes in Lake Tahoe and Palo Alto, California.\n\nIt was reported Aug. 1 that industrywide competition for AI talent had led to unprecedented paychecks that in some cases exceeded those of NBA superstars.\n\nThese massive salaries reflect the stakes for tech giants like Meta that aim to be the first to develop AGI.\n\nOn June 30, it was reported that Zuckerberg announced in an internal memo that he was creating the Superintelligence Labs group that would be led by some of the company\u2019s most recent hires and would include teams working on Meta\u2019s foundation models, product, Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) and the next generation of its models.",

      "text": "That\u2019s according to a report Friday (Aug. 1) by Ars Technica, which cites the example of Matt Deitke, an artificial intelligence (AI) researcher offered $250 million \u2014 over four years \u2014 to bring his expertise to Meta.\nSuch a figure, the report said, \u201cshattered every historical precedent\u201d for scientific and technical compensation the publication was able to find, including the salaries of the people involved in the space race and developing the atomic bomb.\nFor example, J. Robert Oppenheimer, head of the Manhattan Project, made $10,000 per year in 1943, or $190,865 adjusted for inflation. Many professional athletes aren\u2019t in the same neighborhood in terms of compensation. For example, the four-year contract signed by NBA superstar Steph Curry was $35 million less than Deitke\u2019s deal.\nThe report argues these massive salaries reflect the stakes for tech giants like Meta and Google: who will be the first to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) or superintelligence \u2014 or AI capable of performing intellectual tasks at or beyond the human level.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors recently that the company would continue to invest heavily in AI recruitment \u201cbecause we have conviction that superintelligence is going to improve every aspect of what we do.\u201d\nThe report also cites a recent open letter from Zuckerberg in which he described superintelligence as technology that would \u201cbegin an exciting new era of individual empowerment,\u201d while declining to detail what superintelligence actually is.\nApple, meanwhile, is planning to \u201csignificantly\u201d step up its AI investments and dedicate more workers toward building its Apple Intelligence features, CEO Tim Cook said last week.\nDuring the company\u2019s earnings call, Cook said that Apple is making \u201cgood progress\u201d on infusing more AI capabilities with its voice assistant Siri, which are set to come next year.\nThe aim is to develop a \u201cmore personalized\u201d Siri and for AI features in iOS to be \u201cdeeply personal, private and seamlessly integrated,\u201d Cook said. Offerings like live translation and \u201cworkout buddies\u201d are coming soon.\nIn other AI news, PYMNTS wrote last week about research showing that while most chief financial officers (CFOs) say they grasp the concept of agentic artificial intelligence \u2014 systems that can plan, reason and take actions with minimal or no human input \u2014 few are ready to implement it.\nResearch by PYMNTS Intelligence shows that almost all CFOs polled were aware of agentic AI, but only 15% showed interest in using it within their companies.\n\u201cA lot of companies are excited about what agentic AI can do, but not enough are thinking about what it takes to use it safely,\u201d James Prolizo, chief information security officer at Sovos, told PYMNTS. \u201cThese tools are starting to make real decisions, not just automate tasks, and that changes the game.\u201d"

      "text": "This effort is born out of Zuckerberg\u2019s frustration with the tech giant\u2019s limitations in artificial intelligence (AI), Bloomberg News reported Tuesday (June 10), citing sources familiar with the matter.\nAccording to the report, the CEO is recruiting from a pool of AI researchers and engineers who have met with him at his homes in Lake Tahoe and Palo Alto in recent weeks, with the aim of forming what Meta calls a \u201csuperintelligence\u201d group.\nThe sources told Bloomberg that Zuckerberg\u2019s goal is to turn Meta into a leader in the field of artificial general intelligence (AGI), or machines that can perform tasks at the same level as humans. Once Meta reaches that point, it could incorporate AGI into everything from its social media platforms to products like its AI-powered Ray-Ban glasses, the report said.\nPYMNTS has contacted Meta for comment but has not yet gotten a reply.\nZuckerberg plans to hire around 50 people for the new team, including a new head of AI research, the report added. While Zuckerberg has been clear about making AI a priority for Meta, sources say he has recently gone into \u201cfounder mode,\u201d with an increasingly hands-on approach to management.\nThe effort is happening as the company is also \u2014 per an earlier Bloomberg report \u2014 planning a multi-billion dollar investment in Scale AI, which provides data labeling services to help businesses train machine learning models.\nWriting about AGI earlier this year, PYMNTS noted that the realization of that goal would have major implications for business.\nFor instance, one AI system can analyze market trends while at the same time redesigning the supply chain to respond to those changes, that report argued.\nThe technology could handle customer service while also using those interactions to inform product development. It could manage operations while coming up with innovative solutions to efficiency issues. It can make strategic decisions by synthesizing information from multiple industries and domains, something that requires advanced general reasoning.\n\u201cHowever, the challenges are significant as well,\u201d the report added. \u201cThe development of AGI would necessitate major economic and social changes. Industries could be transformed overnight. Jobs would be created and eliminated at unprecedented rates. Companies would need to completely rethink their organizational structures and business models.\u201d"
