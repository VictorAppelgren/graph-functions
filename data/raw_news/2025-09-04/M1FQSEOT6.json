      "text": "Former Opendoor Technologies Inc. OPEN CEO Carrie Wheeler sold 7 million shares worth $34.95 million on Tuesday, according to Securities and Exchange Commission Form 144 filings.\nThe stock sale comes after a retail investor-driven rally saved the company from Nasdaq delisting and pushed shares up over 325% in recent months.\nWheeler Exits After Activist Campaign\nWheeler\u2019s departure followed a successful campaign by hedge fund manager Eric Jackson and retail investors who ousted the former CEO. Jackson, founder of EMJ Capital Ltd., led the \u201cOPEN Army\u201d movement on social media platform X, drawing comparisons to GameStop Corp.\u2018s GME 2021 meme-stock surge.\nThe shares Wheeler sold were restricted stock that vested on Sept. 15, 2021, under a registered compensation plan. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC handled the transaction at approximately $4.99 per share.\nMeme Rally Prevents Delisting Crisis\nOpendoor\u2019s stock surge came at a critical time. The company faced potential Nasdaq delisting for failing to maintain the exchange\u2019s $1 minimum bid price requirement. The retail-driven rally pushed shares above the threshold long enough to regain compliance, allowing the board to cancel a planned reverse stock split.\nFrom June to August, shares rocketed from $0.50 to over $5, helping the company avoid the delisting fate. The stock has gained 222.64% year-to-date, trading at $5.13 as of Wednesday\u2019s close.\nFinancial Challenges Persist Despite Rally\nDespite posting its first adjusted EBITDA profit of $23 million in three years during the second quarter, Opendoor faces headwinds. CFO Selim Freiha warned of \u201clower clearance and record delistings\u201d in housing markets, with contribution margins expected to compress to 2.8%-3.3% in the second half.\nThe company reported $1.57 billion in second-quarter revenue, beating consensus estimates of $1.50 billion, but net losses of $29 million persist. Interim CEO Shrisha Radhakrishna, the company\u2019s CTO, now leads the search for permanent leadership.\nRead Next:\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nPhoto courtesy: Around the World Photos / Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Ark Invest, led by Cathie Wood, made significant trades on Thursday, notably purchasing shares of Figma Inc. FIG. This move comes as Figma\u2019s stock experienced a sharp decline due to disappointing earnings results.\nThe Figma Trade\nArk Invest acquired 108,238 shares of Figma Inc. FIG through its ARK Next Generation Internet ETF ARKW. This purchase occurred as Figma\u2019s stock plummeted nearly 20% on Thursday, closing at $54.56. The total value of the trade amounted to approximately $5.9 million.\nFigma\u2019s stock drop followed the release of its second-quarter earnings, which revealed a revenue of $249.64 million, surpassing the consensus estimate of $228.2 million. However, the company\u2019s earnings per share fell short, recording zero cents compared to the expected 18 cents. Analysts subsequently adjusted their forecasts for Figma, contributing to the bearish sentiment.\nDespite the earnings miss, Figma\u2019s revenue showed a 41% year-over-year increase from $177.2 million in the same quarter last year. The mixed results and subsequent analyst downgrades led to the stock\u2019s significant decline, possibly presenting an opportunity for Ark Invest to increase its stake.\nOther Key Trades:\n- Roku Inc. (ROKU): Sold 26,465 shares from the ARKK ETF.\n- Intellia Therapeutics Inc. (NTLA): Purchased 131,700 shares for the ARKK ETF.\n- Genius Sports Ltd (GENI): Sold 428,277 shares from the ARKW ETF.\nBenzinga's Edge Stock Rankings show that Figma stock checks out on Medium and Long Price Trends.

The company\u2019s board has not yet determined how the funds will be used.\nPrice Action: According to data from Benzinga Pro, NEON stock is trading lower by 69.1% to $6.65 Thursday morning. The stock has a 52-week high of $29.90 and a 52-week low of $3.80.\nRead Also: China\u2019s EHang Is The \u2018First And Only\u2019 To Fly \u2013 Joby, Archer Are Still Filing Paperwork\nHow To Buy NEON Stock\nBesides going to a brokerage platform to purchase a share \u2013 or fractional share \u2013 of stock, you can also gain access to shares either by buying an exchange traded fund (ETF) that holds the stock itself, or by allocating yourself to a strategy in your 401(k) that would seek to acquire shares in a mutual fund or other instrument.\nFor example, in Neonode\u2019s case, it is in the Information Technology sector. An ETF will likely hold shares in many liquid and large companies that help track that sector, allowing an investor to gain exposure to the trends within that segment.\nImage: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\nThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
