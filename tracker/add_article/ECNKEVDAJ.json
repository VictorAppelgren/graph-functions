      "summary": "The Trump administration is moving to add the Louisiana State Penitentiary (Angola) as a new ICE detention site, expanding the state’s role in federal immigration enforcement. Angola, a 6,300‑bed maximum‑security prison with a history of harsh conditions, will become the state’s 10th ICE facility. The expansion is part of a broader plan to add 80,000 new detention beds, backed by a $45 billion congressional appropriation, and reflects the administration’s strategy of partnering with Republican‑led states to house and deport migrants far from the border.",
