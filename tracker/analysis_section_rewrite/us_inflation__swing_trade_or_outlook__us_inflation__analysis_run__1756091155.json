      "feedback": "Strong foundation and clear macro-to-crypto logic, but the draft needs a tighter, section-compliant rewrite to world-class quality. actionable edits: (1) restructure Movers & Scenarios to exactly four lines, two Up and two Down, with the required fields strictly in place and time windows limited to 0–3 weeks and 3–6 months; anchor each line’s probability to explicit evidence (e.g., Up 0–3w ~85% from Powell cut odds in 17F49LURJ; Up 3–6m ~65% from ETF/corporate ether demand signals cited in R3WNA7L7A/NL5YYTLF2/OGK8WLL69; Down 0–3w ~25% from hawkish risks (17F49LURJ/OGK8WLL69); Down 3–6m ~40% from Regime B/C risk). (2) Make Driver/Mechanism and What to Watch one crisp clause each per line; avoid multi‑clause composites, and cite every factual claim with the appropriate IDs. (3) For the Swing Trade, since ETH is tradable, replace the current diffuse lines with a single or pair of concise lines: Direction Up | Horizon 3–6 months | Entry at around the prevailing ETH price band (cite the ~4,000–5,000 anchor from OGK8WLL69) | Stop at a defined support level | Target near prior highs/ATH (documented in OGK8WLL69) | R/R and Invalidation tied to ETF inflows/staking momentum (cite NL5YYTLF2/OGK8WLL69) | Trigger (e.g., sustained ETF inflows >$5B/month) | Probability % anchored to the cited evidence (e.g., 65%) | Confidence 60–65. (4) Rebuild the causal chain as: policy clarity/data‑driven easing lowers real rates → discounted crypto cash flows rise → institutional demand (ETF inflows, staking) supports ETH leadership; prune all extraneous macro passages and keep to a concise, one‑page cross‑asset map. (5) Clean up conflicts and reconciliation: apply a single default regime bias (Regime A on disinflation with easing) unless wage/inflation momentum solidifies Regime B/C, with a defined ±5% probability swing rule and explicit cross‑source reconciliation (NL5YYTLF2/R3WNA7L7A). (6) Ensure every assertion using numbers or facts has an in‑text ID from the SOURCE MATERIAL and remove trailing reference lists; deliver four polished Movers lines plus one concise Swing/Outlook line per the constraints.",
