      "text": "Support Wildfire Relief with BottleDrop\nDonate NowOregon Wildfires\nLast year, Oregon experienced a record-breaking wildfire season with 1.9 million acres burned. According to experts, the Pacific Northwest is anticipated to be at elevated risk of significant fires from August to October. Earlier this summer, Governor Tina Kotek declared a State of Emergency due to the imminent threat of wildfires.\nAs in previous years, OBRC and BottleDrop are working with boots-on-the-ground wildland firefighting camps to facilitate their beverage container redemptions during this wildfire season. OBRC is also activating its emergency fund, which allows OBRC and its customers to magnify their support for those impacted by recent, ongoing and future wildfires.\nDonate Through BottleDrop\nOBRC is inviting its BottleDrop community to support wildfire relief through container donations. OBRC\u2019s Emergency Fund will match up to $20,000 in total donations made via BottleDrop through Oct. 7, 2025 to support those impacted by this year\u2019s wildfires.\nDonations received through OBRC\u2019s Emergency Fund will be split between three organizations providing wildfire relief in Oregon:\n- American Red Cross, Cascades Region, supporting residents impacted by wildfires by providing shelters, meals, and emergency supplies.\n- United Way of the Columbia Gorge, Rowena Fire Relief Recovery Fund, providing immediate support for those in need of shelter, food, clothes and more while working with local partners to mobilize resources and lead collaborative efforts to rebuild.\n- Wildland Firefighter Foundation, Oregon Chapter, supporting those on the frontlines of the wildfires by helping injured firefighters and families of those killed in the line of duty.\nHow You Can Donate\nThere are two ways to donate (and have your funds matched!):\n- Online from your BottleDrop account and directly to the OBRC Emergency Fund.\n- In-person at any full-service BottleDrop Redemption Center (visit the Customer Service Counter with your containers and let staff know you would like to direct your donation to the OBRC Emergency Fund)\nBottleDrop customers are incredibly generous, and we are proud to work together to leverage the power of bottles and cans, supporting organizations making a big difference for communities and residents across the state, especially for those impacted by the wildfires.\nHelpful Wildfire Resources\n-\nPrevent\nHow to Prevent WildfiresLearn how to prevent wildfires with information from the Oregon State Fire Marshall.\n-\nPrepare\nBe Wildfire ReadyLearn how to prepare for wildfires with information from the Oregon Department of Emergency Management.\n-\nBe Aware\nCurrent Wildfire InformationStay informed with current wildfire information from the Oregon Department of Forestry."
