  "description": "If a named storm forms, it would be the seventh storm of the season and be called Gabrielle.",
  "content": "Don't look now and spoil your Labor Day weekend, but by this time next week, another tropical system could be worth watching as it crosses the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is monitoring a tropical wave expected to move off the African coast on Aug. 31. After it moves into the Atlantic, environmental conditions in the region could support slow development of a tropical storm as the wave moves westward, the hurricane center said.\n\nIf a named storm forms, it would be the seventh tropical storm of the season. According to the official list of names for the 2025 season, the next name up is Gabrielle.\n\nThe center's outlook map shows a 30% chance of a tropical system formation within seven days, along a path stretching between the Cabo Verde Islands and the middle of the tropical Atlantic.\n\nThe timing and location of the westward- to northwestward-moving wave would coincide with a long-term outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center that showed increased chances of a storm forming in the region over the week between Sept. 3 and 9. From Sept. 10, the center predicts enhanced chances for storm activity in the midst of the tropical Atlantic as well as a greater than 20% chance of activity in the southern Gulf and northwestern Caribbean.\n\nOver the 30-year period between 1991 and 2020, the seventh storm of the season forms on average by Sept. 3.\n\nErin was the only hurricane so far this season, even though the second hurricane typically forms by Aug. 26. Erin battered beaches and sea turtle nests along much of the Atlantic coast. Rough surf and rip currents stirred up by its high winds and large size are blamed for the deaths of two swimmers, one in New Hampshire and one off Long Island. A boater in his 50s went missing after a vessel capsized off the Massachusetts coast on Aug. 25\n\nSeasonal outlooks for the 2025 season from NOAA and others have predicted a busier than normal season, and forecasters say they still expect that to be the case.\n\nThe annual hurricane season in the Atlantic typically reaches its peak on Sept. 10, but 13 of last year's named storms formed on or after Sept. 9, including Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton. The Atlantic season officially began on June 1 and will last through the end of November.\n\nSee where the disturbance is forecast to go\n\nHurricanes are born in the tropics, above warm water. Clusters of thunderstorms can develop over the ocean when water temperatures exceed 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If conditions are right, the clusters swirl into a storm known as a tropical wave or tropical depression.\n\nA tropical depression becomes a named tropical storm once its sustained wind speeds reaches 39 miles per hour. When its winds reach 74 mph, the storm officially becomes a hurricane.\n\nDelaying potentially lifesaving preparations could mean waiting until it\u2019s too late. \"Get your disaster supplies while the shelves are still stocked, and get that insurance checkup early, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recommends.\n\u2022 Develop an evacuation plan. If you are at risk from hurricanes, you need an evacuation plan. Now is the time to begin planning where you would go and how you would get there.\n\u2022 Assemble disaster supplies. Whether you\u2019re evacuating or sheltering in place, you\u2019re going to need supplies not just to get through the storm but for a possibly lengthy aftermath, NOAA said.\n\u2022 Get an insurance checkup and document your possessions. Contact your insurance company or agent now and ask for an insurance checkup to make sure you have enough insurance to repair or even replace your home and belongings. Remember, home and renters insurance don\u2019t cover flooding, so you\u2019ll need a separate policy for those. Flood insurance is available through your company, agent or the National Flood Insurance Program. Act now, because flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period.\n\u2022 Create a family communication plan. NOAA says you should take the time now to write down a hurricane plan and share it with your family. Determine family meeting places and make sure to include an out-of-town location in case of evacuation.\n\u2022 Strengthen your home. Now is the time to improve your home\u2019s ability to withstand hurricanes. Trim trees and install storm shutters, accordion shutters and impact glass; seal outside wall openings.",

      "text": "After an emergency, you may need to survive on your own for several days. Being prepared means having your own food, water and other supplies to last for several days. A disaster supplies kit is a collection of basic items your household may need in the event of an emergency.\nMake sure your emergency kit is stocked with the items on the checklist below. Download a printable version to take with you to the store. Once you take a look at the basic items consider what unique needs your family might have, such as supplies for pets or seniors.\nEmergency Supply List\nEmergency Supply Kit Checklist Translations\nBasic Disaster Supplies Kit\nTo assemble your kit store items in airtight plastic bags and put your entire disaster supplies kit in one or two easy-to-carry containers such as plastic bins or a duffel bag.\nA basic emergency supply kit could include the following recommended items:\n- Water (one gallon per person per day for several days, for drinking and sanitation)\n- Food (at least a several-day supply of non-perishable food)\n- Battery-powered or hand crank radio and a NOAA Weather Radio with tone alert\n- Flashlight\n- First aid kit\n- Extra batteries\n- Whistle (to signal for help)\n- Dust mask (to help filter contaminated air)\n- Plastic sheeting, scissors and duct tape (to shelter in place)\n- Moist towelettes, garbage bags and plastic ties (for personal sanitation)\n- Wrench or pliers (to turn off utilities)\n- Manual can opener (for food)\n- Local maps\n- Cell phone with chargers and a backup battery\nAdditional Emergency Supplies\nConsider adding the following items to your emergency supply kit based on your individual needs:\n- Soap, hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes to disinfect surfaces\n- Prescription medications. About half of all Americans take a prescription medicine every day. An emergency can make it difficult for them to refill their prescription or to find an open pharmacy. Organize and protect your prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, and vitamins to prepare for an emergency.\n- Non-prescription medications such as pain relievers, anti-diarrhea medication, antacids or laxatives\n- Prescription eyeglasses and contact lens solution\n- Infant formula, bottles, diapers, wipes and diaper rash cream\n- Pet food and extra water for your pet\n- Cash or traveler's checks\n- Important family documents such as copies of insurance policies, identification and bank account records saved electronically or in a waterproof, portable container\n- Sleeping bag or warm blanket for each person\n- Complete change of clothing appropriate for your climate and sturdy shoes\n- Fire extinguisher\n- Matches in a waterproof container\n- Feminine supplies and personal hygiene items\n- Mess kits, paper cups, plates, paper towels and plastic utensils\n- Paper and pencil\n- Books, games, puzzles or other activities for children\nMaintaining Your Kit\nAfter assembling your kit remember to maintain it so it\u2019s ready when needed:\n- Keep canned food in a cool, dry place.\n- Store boxed food in tightly closed plastic or metal containers.\n- Replace expired items as needed.\n- Re-think your needs every year and update your kit as your family\u2019s needs change.\nKit Storage Locations\nSince you do not know where you will be when an emergency occurs, prepare supplies for home, work and cars.\n- Home: Keep this kit in a designated place and have it ready in case you have to leave your home quickly. Make sure all family members know where the kit is kept.\n- Work: Be prepared to shelter at work for at least 24 hours. Your work kit should include food, water and other necessities like medicines, as well as comfortable walking shoes, stored in a \u201cgrab and go\u201d case.\n- Car: In case you are stranded, keep a kit of emergency supplies in your car."

      "text": "Hurricane names listed for 2025 Atlantic season\nThe 2025 Atlantic hurricane season starts June 1, but we already know what all the storms will be named.\nThe list of storm names is created by the World Meteorological Organization well in advance of the hurricane season. But we don't yet know how many storms will form this year, or how strong they will be.\nCould there be a Tropical Storm Andrea, or perhaps a Hurricane Karen in our future? How about Tropical Depression Jerry?\nHow bad will the 2025 hurricane season be? It's too soon to say for sure, but forecasters have started the year with some good news.\nA tropical storm gets a name when its sustained winds reach 39 mph; it becomes a hurricane when its winds reach 74 mph.\nA typical Atlantic hurricane season averages about 14 tropical storms, seven of which spin into hurricanes, based on weather records that date from 1991 to 2020.\nForecasts about the predicted severity of the 2025 hurricane season will be coming out in the weeks and months ahead from private, university and government groups.\nHere is the list of names for the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season\nThe names are given out in alphabetical order, and each new storm gets the next name on the list. There are no Q, U, X, Y, or Z names because of the lack of names that begin with those letters.\nHow bad will the 2025 hurricane season be?

The eastern Pacific season begins on May 15, more than two weeks earlier than the Atlantic season.\nThere is also a separate list of names for Central Pacific hurricanes, which can occasionally hit or impact Hawaii. In addition, there are separate lists for typhoons in the western Pacific and tropical cyclones in Australia and the Indian Ocean.\nWhy \u2013 and how \u2013 do hurricanes get names?\nBefore hurricane forecasters started naming storms, they had to refer to storms by saying something like \"the storm 500 miles east-southeast of Miami.\" But six hours later, the storm's position would change.\nAlso, when more than one storm was going on at the same time, making it clear which storm was being described made the job even harder.\nHow bad will the 2025 hurricane season be? It's too soon to say for sure, but forecasters have started the year with some good news.\nIn 1953, the U.S. began using female names for hurricanes. By 1979, male and female names were being used. The names alternate between male and female.\nThe World Meteorological Organization, based in Geneva, chooses hurricane names several years in advance, based on strict criteria. If a hurricane is particularly deadly or costly, its name is \"retired\" by the WMO and replaced by another one."

      "text": "Prepare now for hurricanes, Trump warns. Here's what you should do.\nNOAA says the best time to prepare for oncoming storms is now \u2013 well before the official start of Hurricane season.\nNational Hurricane Preparedness Week was designated by President Donald Trump on May 5, a reminder that deadly hurricanes will soon be brewing.\nThe Atlantic Hurricane season starts June 1. Presidents dating back to at least George W. Bush have issued proclamations about the preparedness week tradition, which warns of danger ahead.\nAccording to Trump's latest proclamation, this is \"a time to raise awareness about the dangers of these storms and encourage citizens in coastal areas and inland communities to be vigilant in emergency planning and preparation.\"Yet another active year is predicted, with as many as 17 named storms possible, according to a forecast from Colorado State University experts.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says the best time to prepare for oncoming storms is now \u2013 well before the official start of the season. \"Take action TODAY to be better prepared for when the worst happens. Understand your risk from hurricanes, and begin pre-season preparations now.\"\nDelaying potentially life-saving preparations could mean waiting until it\u2019s too late. \"Get your disaster supplies while the shelves are still stocked, and get that insurance checkup early, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period,\" NOAA recommends.\nHere are five things you should do now:\n1. Develop an evacuation plan\nIf you are at risk from hurricanes, you need an evacuation plan. Now is the time to begin planning where you would go and how you would get there.\nYou do not need to travel hundreds of miles. Your destination could be a friend or relative who lives in a well-built home outside flood prone areas. Plan several routes and be sure to account for your pets.\n2. Assemble disaster supplies\nWhether you\u2019re evacuating or sheltering-in-place, you\u2019re going to need supplies not just to get through the storm but for the potentially lengthy aftermath, NOAA said.\nHave enough non-perishable food, water and medicine to last each person in your family a minimum of three days (store a longer than 3-day supply of water, if possible). Electricity and water could be out for weeks. You\u2019ll need extra cash, a battery-powered radio and flashlights. You may need a portable crank or solar-powered USB charger for your cell phones. And lastly, don\u2019t forget your pets!\n3. Get an insurance checkup and document your possessions\nContact your insurance company or agent now and ask for an insurance check-up to make sure you have enough insurance to repair or even replace your home and/or belongings. Remember, home and renters insurance doesn\u2019t cover flooding, so you\u2019ll need a separate policy for it. Flood insurance is available through your company, agent, or the National Flood Insurance Program. Act now, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period.\nAlso take the time before hurricane season begins to document your possessions: photos, serial numbers, or anything else that you may need to provide your insurance company when filing a claim.\n4. Create a family communication plan\nNOAA said to take the time now to write down your hurricane plan, and share it with your family. Determine family meeting places, and make sure to include an out-of-town location in case of evacuation.\nWrite down on paper a list of emergency contacts, and make sure to include utilities and other critical services \u2013 remember, the Internet may not be accessible during or after a storm.\n5. Strengthen your home\nNow is the time to improve your home\u2019s ability to withstand hurricane impacts. Trim trees; install storm shutters, accordion shutters, and/or impact glass; seal outside wall openings.\nRemember, the garage door is the most vulnerable part of the home, so it must be able to withstand hurricane-force winds. Many retrofits are not as costly or time consuming as you may think, NOAA said.\nIf you\u2019re a renter, work with your landlord now to prepare for a storm.\nAnd remember \u2013 now is the time to purchase the proper plywood, steel or aluminum panels to have on hand if you need to board up the windows and doors ahead of an approaching storm."

      "text": "NHC eyes 2 tropical waves in Pacific, 1 in Atlantic: See tracker\nThe Pacific Ocean remains somewhat active after Tropical Storm Juliette dissipated while the Atlantic is pretty calm for now, with only one tropical wave brewing.\nThe National Hurricane Center said in an 11 p.m. PDT advisory on Aug. 28 it is tracking two tropical waves in the Pacific, with both having medium-to-high chances of developing into stronger storms in the coming days.\nThe first system is currently a broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. The system, labeled by the NHC as EP93, is producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms and forecasters say environmental conditions appear conducive for gradual development of this system.\n\"A tropical depression is likely to form late this weekend while the system moves west-northwestward around 15 mph across the central to western part of the eastern Pacific basin,\" forecasters said in the advisory. The system has a 60% chance of formation through the next 48 hours.\nA second area of low pressure could form this weekend or early next week in the Pacific, off the coast of southern Mexico, according to the NHC. Environmental conditions appear conducive for some gradual development of this system, a tropical depression could form by the middle of next week as it moves west-northwestward offshore of Mexico.\nForecasters give this system a 60% chance of formation through the next seven days.\nNHC also tracking a tropical wave in the Atlantic\nIn the Atlantic, a tropical wave is forecast to emerge off the west coast of Africa on Sunday, Aug. 31, according to the hurricane center.\nForecasters said environmental conditions could support some slow development of this system as it moves westward to west-northwestward next week. The hurricane center gives the system a 20% chance of formation through the next seven days.\nStorm tracker\nThis forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\nHow do hurricanes form?\nHurricanes are born in the tropics, above warm water. Clusters of thunderstorms can develop over the ocean when water temperatures exceed 80 degrees. If conditions are right, the clusters swirl into a storm known as a tropical wave or tropical depression.\nA tropical depression becomes a named tropical storm once its sustained wind speeds reach 39 mph.

This is why we are encouraging everyone to \u201cBe in the Know\u201d to evacuate safely.\nKnow Your Risks\n- It\u2019s important to understand your location\u2019s risks because no two communities face the same extreme weather conditions. You can find your local risks with FEMA\u2019s National Risk Index.\nKnow When and Where to Go\n- Whether it's the home of a friend or family member or a pre-designated shelter, know your evacuation destination.\n- Having these plans in place can save valuable time and, most importantly, lives.\n- Many states have designated evacuation zones and predetermined evacuation routes. Learn your state and local plans by visiting your state and county emergency management websites.\nKnow What to Bring\n- Build a go-bag with all the essentials you might need, so you don\u2019t need to scramble in an evacuation situation. Find a list of supplies at Build A Kit.\n- Make sure everyone in your household knows where the bag is stored, and who is responsible for it in the event of an emergency.\nKnow Your Information Sources\n- Identify where you can access reliable information so you can make informed decisions before, during, and after a disaster. Keeping up to date with the latest developments can save lives.\n- Sign up for alerts from your local emergency management agencies and the National Weather Service, which will provide updates on threat conditions, shelter locations, and other important safety information.\n- Download the FEMA App where you can receive real-time weather alerts, locate emergency shelters in your area, prepare for common hazards, and more.\nBefore an Evacuation\n- Learn the types of disasters that are likely in your community and the local emergency, evacuation and shelter plans for each specific disaster.\n- Plan how you will leave and where you will go if you are advised to evacuate.\n- Check with local officials about what shelter spaces are available for this year.\n- Identify several places you could go in an emergency such as a friend\u2019s home in another town or a motel. Choose destinations in different directions so that you have options during an emergency.\n- If needed, identify a place to stay that will accept pets. Most public shelters allow only service animals.\n- Be familiar with alternate routes and other means of transportation out of your area.\n- Always follow the instructions of local officials and remember that your evacuation route may be on foot depending on the type of disaster.\n- Visit FEMA\u2019s National Risk Index, an interactive tool anyone can use to improve their understanding of natural hazard risk where they live so they can take action to protect themselves.\n- Come up with a family/household plan to stay in touch in case you become separated; have a meeting place and update it depending on the circumstance.\n- Assemble supplies that are ready for evacuation. Prepare a \u201cgo-bag\u201d you can carry when you evacuate on foot or public transportation and supplies for traveling longer distances if you have a car.\n- If you have a car:\n- Keep a full tank of gas if an evacuation seems likely.

      "text": "How a distant hurricane likely killed 2 people\nThe massive Hurricane Erin roughed up the sea and surf, causing rip currents expected to be blamed for two rip deaths in the United States.\nAt least two deaths in the mainland United States are expected to be attributed to rough surf conditions as Hurricane Erin moved away from the coast, and police continue searching for a person missing from a capsized vessel in Maine.\nA 59-year-old swimmer drowned in New York, and a 17-year-old boy was swept away in a strong current in New Hampshire, authorities said.\nThe weekend deaths mark at least 69 surf zone fatalities in the United States this year, according to the National Weather Service.\nIn the days ahead of Hurricane Erin's arrival along the Atlantic Coast, Michael Brennan, director of the National Hurricane Center, pleaded with people to use caution in the surf. The late-summer weather may seem ideal for a beach trip, but rip current fatalities tend to occur in these conditions, Brennan warned people on Aug. 16 to heed warnings and stay close to lifeguards.\nMany beaches along the U.S. Atlantic Coast were closed last week as the massive and powerful hurricane passed a few hundred miles offshore and stirred up big waves and rough surf.\nTeen dies in New Hampshire\nWitnesses said a teen and his father, 61, were swept away on Aug. 24 in a strong current at Hampton Beach, according to New Hampshire State Police, who are conducting an investigation.\nThe teen had been swimming with family members at about 6:45 p.m., when he was pulled away from shore by a strong ocean current, reported Seacoastonline, a USA TODAY Network property. The boy\u2019s father went into the water to try to rescue his son, but also became distressed.\nState Beach Patrol lifeguards were off duty at the time of the incident, but were called back to the scene and brought the boy and his father to shore and began lifesaving efforts, according to the state police. The teen and his father were taken to the hospital. The name of the teen was withheld because he was a minor.\nA high surf advisory, for the swells and rip currents caused by Hurricane Erin, was in effect at beaches on Aug. 24, meteorologist Stephen Baron, with the National Weather Service office in Gray, Maine, confirmed to USA TODAY.\nSouth Carolina man dies in New York\nOn Aug. 23 in New York, Ishmoile Mohammed, 59, of South Carolina, was swimming in the ocean at Sailors Haven in Fire Island National Seashore when he was caught in a rip current, according to Suffolk County Police.\nLifeguards pulled Mohammed from the water and rendered aid with the assistance of National Park Service employees. Mohammed was airlifted to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\nA rip current advisory was in effect along the New York coast. The weather service office in New York City warned on Aug. 24 at 3:49 p.m. of \"life-threatening swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion.\"\nOcean often deadly when hurricanes are offshore\nThe National Hurricane Center, along with other weather service offices, has worked to raise awareness of the life-threatening hazards from rip currents and strong surf. The parent agency of the weather service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, launched a new effort this summer, with the slogan \"Know Your Blue IQ.\"\nBetween 2013 and 2022, 15% of all direct hurricane fatalities in the United States were attributed to hazardous surf and rip current conditions, the weather service and hurricane center found in a study released in 2023. An additional 3% of deaths were attributed to offshore marine incidents.\nBoater missing after incident in Erin's rough waters\nAuthorities in Massachusetts continued their third day of searching on Aug. 25 for a man in his 50s who remained missing following a boating incident on Aug. 23, said the Massachusetts State Police. The state police, the Massachusetts Environmental Police and the U.S. Coast Guard searched for the missing boater. Names have not been released for the missing man or the person rescued after the incident.\n\"We remain focused on reuniting the missing person with his loved ones,\" the state police said late Sunday. \"Despite challenging weather and sea conditions, including 6-8\u2019 swells, Troopers and Coast Guardsman performed sonar scans, dives, surface and aerial patrols\" on Sunday, Aug. 24. A state police marine unit with divers continued searching on Monday, Aug. 25. While the boater wasn't located, the team found evidence of the vessel's wreckage, police said.\nSwimmers rescued in Maryland\nElsewhere along the Atlantic Coast over the weekend, lifeguards rescued three girls in Ocean City, Maryland, on Aug. 22 after they were caught up in a rip current.\n\"This is why we restrict swimming and wading,\" Captain Butch Arbin with Ocean City Beach Patrol said, in a message on the patrol's Facebook page.\nWhile water access was restricted to ankle depth, three girls headed into the ocean between lifeguard stands, Arbin said. As a surf rescue technician attempted to move them in closer to shore, a wave broke, knocking them down and a rip current began pulling them out to deeper water, Arbin said. An inexperienced surfer was also rescued that day, he added. The three girls later visited the department's headquarters to offer letters of thanks.\nContributing: USA TODAY Network, including Keith Demko with the Salisbury Times, and Angeljean Chiaramida at Seacoastonline.\nDinah Voyles Pulver, a national correspondent for USA TODAY, writes about climate change, violent weather and other news.

      "text": "Sharks vs. hurricanes? Scientists say predators can help track huge storms.\nResearchers are looking at how sharks can help gather ocean data for improved hurricane predictions by using sharks as freely moving ocean monitors.\nIt's not a schlocky TV movie or teams in a hockey game. Sharks vs. hurricanes is real science.\nResearchers are looking at how sharks can help gather ocean data for improved hurricane predictions by using the predators as freely moving monitors by putting sensor tags on them. The goal is that the sharks will gather temperature and other data that will go toward improving hurricane forecasting \u2013 data that's challenging or expensive to get elsewhere.\n\"By attaching these tags ... to sharks, which are wide-ranging, mobile predators, we will be able to observe a much larger part of the ocean that typically remains unobserved,\" said marine ecologist Aaron Carlisle of the University of Delaware in an email to USA TODAY.\nHe said it's not so much that we can't obtain such data using other means (such as vessels or autonomous vehicles), it's that those other platforms are very expensive and are limited in where they can go. In addition, \"remote sensing via satellite-based sensors only looks at the surface, and it is what is going on below the surface that is really critical for many oceanographic/climate processes (such as hurricanes).\"\nWater temps drive hurricane formation\nAccording to Carlisle, water temperature and how it changes with depth is what drives ocean heat content, and that is generally what drives hurricanes in the Atlantic. He said salinity is important, too, but is less crucial. Indeed, according to the National Weather Service, the first condition for hurricane formation is that ocean waters must be above 79 degrees.\n\"Below this threshold temperature, hurricanes will not form or will weaken rapidly once they move over water below this threshold. Ocean temperatures in the tropical East Pacific and the tropical Atlantic routinely surpass this threshold,\" the weather service said.\nWhat species of sharks are being used?\nBlue sharks and mako sharks are two of the species best suited to carry the sensor tags because of their movement and diving characteristics.\nThis isn't the first time animals have been used in a similar way for scientific research. Marine life such as seals and narwhals have been tagged to track hard-to-reach areas in the Arctic and Antarctic, The Washington Post reports. Dolphins and whales have been used by Russia for military purposes.\nWill the data captured by the sharks be used during actual hurricanes?\n\"Our goal is to have a 'fleet' of sharks carrying these tags during the hurricane season, and they will be providing real-time oceanographic data across the North Atlantic that will be fed into various ocean models that are used to predict hurricane strength, intensity, direction, etc.,\" Carlisle said in an e-mail.\nHis team carried out tagging experiments with the sharks in May, with some success.\n\"As to whether the sharks will be in the actual hurricanes remains to be seen, but I suspect they will avoid them and won't be surfacing during hurricanes!\"\nIs the goal to have the sharks deployed this year, during the 2025 season?\nThis year, researchers are still working out bugs and are limited in the number of tags that can be deployed because of the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a huge impact on this project, Carlisle said.\n\"Our hope, if we obtain sufficient additional funding to keep things moving forward, is that we will be actually doing this type of work on a larger scale in 2026 (if lucky) or more likely 2027.\"\nFunding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been more than satisfactory for the project, and Carlisle said \"the agency has been incredibly supportive of us throughout this process.\" The teams' partner, the Mid-Atlantic Regional Association Coastal Ocean Observing System, also has been helpful.\nAre the sharks harmed by having tags attached to them?\n\"That's a topic that we are keenly aware of in our field,\" Carlisle said. \"Attaching anything to an animal will have some impact on the animal, but we do everything in our power to minimize any negative impacts on the animal.\"\nIn addition, Carlisle and his team go through a permitting and review process that ensures they do everything they can to minimize the effect on animals. Beyond that, he said, researchers need the animals to be \"happy and healthy\" to provide the team with good data, because they are carrying expensive equipment (each tag costs about $6,000). So if the tag has too much of an effect on the animal, \"we aren't just hurting the animal but we're essentially throwing the tag away.\"\nThe tags will not be on the animals permanently: Researchers use parts that will corrode over time and allow the whole tag package to fall off."

A final forecast has been released.\nTop experts from Colorado State University are still maintaining their prediction of a slightly above-average season.\nTop experts from Colorado State University released their final planned forecast for the Atlantic hurricane season on Aug. 6, including a state-by-state look at upcoming hurricane risk.\nOverall, the outlook maintains a prediction of a slightly above-average season of 8 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. A major hurricane has wind speeds of at least 111 mph.\nA \"normal\" year sees 14 named storms, of which seven become hurricanes.\n\"We're keeping the forecast the same as what we predicted in early July\" (16 named storms of which 8 become hurricanes), Colorado State meteorologist Phil Klotzbach told USA TODAY. This includes the four storms that have already formed.\nThe news comes as August brings a pivot point in hurricane season and increased tropical activity in the Atlantic.\nTropical Atlantic is now warm enough for hurricanes\nAccording to the updated forecast, the tropical Atlantic has warmed faster than normal over the past few weeks. \"When the waters in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean Sea are warmer than normal, it tends to favor an above-average season, since a hurricane\u2019s fuel source is warm ocean water. Additionally, a warm Atlantic leads to lower atmospheric pressure and a more unstable atmosphere. Both conditions favor hurricane formation,\" the forecast said.\n\"Water temperatures are pretty much warm enough everywhere in the tropical Atlantic to support hurricane formation,\" Klotzbach told USA TODAY.\nIn addition, the Colorado State team anticipates \"a slightly above-average probability for major hurricanes making landfall along the continental United States coastline and in the Caribbean for the remainder of the hurricane season.\"\nHurricane risk by state\nThe updated forecast includes a state-by-state look at hurricane risk. Those calculations predict the chances of a storm passing within 50 miles of the state.\nPer usual, the highest risk is in Florida, which faces an 89% chance of being impacted by a tropical storm and a 61% chance of being impacted by a hurricane.\nWill your state be impacted by a hurricane? Here's what to know about the risk in 2025, according to the new outlook:\nWill a hurricane impact Alabama in 2025?\nIn Alabama, there's a 63% storm chance and a 31% hurricane chance. There is also a 9% chance of a major hurricane tracking within 50 miles of Alabama, according to CSU experts.\nWill a hurricane impact Connecticut in 2025?\nThere is a 25% storm chance and 9% hurricane chance in Connecticut.\nWill a hurricane impact Delaware in 2025?\nThere is a 25% storm chance and 7% hurricane chance in Delaware.\nWill a hurricane impact Florida in 2025?\nIn Florida, there is an 89% storm chance and a 61% hurricane chance. There is also a 32% chance of a major hurricane tracking within 50 miles of the state.\nWill a hurricane impact Georgia in 2025?\nThere is a 68% storm chance and a 34% hurricane chance in Georgia.\nWill a hurricane impact Louisiana in 2025?\nIn Louisiana, there is a 71% storm chance and a 43% hurricane chance.

      "text": "What does fierce Hurricane Erin mean for the rest of the season?\nHurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, briefly reached Catagory 5 status. What does the intense storm mean for the rest of the 2025?\nHurricane Erin, a major storm that is forecast to churn offshore of the East Coast of the United States for the next several days, briefly attained Category 5 status on Aug. 16 as it intensified in the Atlantic.\nCategory 5 hurricanes are the rarest of storms, with only a small fraction of all tropical cyclones reaching that intense wind speed of 157 mph or more.\nCould this Category 5 storm \u2013 among the earliest on record \u2013 be a harbinger of a potentially catastrophic season to come? USA TODAY reached out to experts for their take on the question.\nIs Erin a sign of a potentially catastrophic hurricane season to come?\n\u201cErin's rapid intensification to Cat 5 does not mean potentially more Cat 5 hurricanes this year,\" said Yonggang Liu, an associate professor of physical oceanography at the University of South Florida and director of its Ocean Circulation Lab.\nColorado State University research scientist Levi Silvers, in an e-mail to USA TODAY, said that Erin's Cat 5 status doesn't affect the forecast for the rest of the season overall.\n\"Based on the atmospheric conditions and warm sea-surface temperature we do expect an above-average season. This includes a forecast of additional major hurricanes,\" he said. \"The rapid intensification of Erin to a Category 5 hurricane was a bit startling to see, but it does not change our forecast.\"\nDan Brown, branch chief of the hurricane specialists at the National Hurricane Center, shared similar thoughts with USA TODAY: \"There is little correlation between the occurrence of a Category 5 hurricane and the overall activity of the season.\"\nBrown pointed to two previous seasons for comparison.\n\"In 1992, the first hurricane of the season was Category 5 Hurricane Andrew, but that storm was the only major hurricane in the Atlantic basin that year and only seven named storms formed overall,\" he said. \"In contrast, during the 2024 hurricane season, Beryl became a Category 5 hurricane in July and four additional major hurricanes formed that year with a total of 18 named storms.\"\nThe most recent Colorado State University forecast, released earlier in August, calls for a total of a total of eight hurricanes in 2025, of which three are predicted to be major. Based on that forecast, seven hurricanes could still be expected to form in the remainder of 2025, of which two could be major.\nSilvers also clarified the definition of a \"catastrophic season.\"\n\"Unfortunately, it only takes one intense hurricane making landfall in a vulnerable region to result in a catastrophic season,\" he said. \"Fortunately, Erin is not forecast to make landfall.\"\nBrown agreed, saying \"the most important lesson is to remember it only takes one hurricane to affect you for it to be a bad year where you live.\"\n\"As we approach the peak of the hurricane season, now is the time to find out if you live in an evacuation zone and make sure you have a hurricane plan in place,\" Brown said.\nIs there any correlation between Cat 5s in August and activity in the remainder of the season?\nSilvers said he's \"not aware of a correlation between Category 5s in August and later season activity.\" But he added: \"Since we still have not reached the climatological peak of the hurricane season, we do expect a lot of further activity.\"\nThe climatological peak of the season is usually around Sept. 10, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nOverall, Silvers concluded that \"one of the difficulties with this type of correlation is the small number of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes that occur in August. They are certainly not unprecedented, but they are rare, and this makes calculating robust statistical relationships difficult.\"\nHow fast did Hurricane Erin intensify?\nHurricane Erin's wind speeds rocketed Aug. 16. Erin, the fifth named storm of this season, quickly exceeded expectations after undergoing a period of strengthening the hurricane center refers to as \"rapid intensification.\"\nErin's burst of intensification will be among the most rapid ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean.\nIts winds increased 45 mph in just 12 hours overnight on Friday, Aug. 15, from 75 mph to 120 mph. Ultimately, its wind speeds increased a total of 80 mph in just 18 hours.\nHurricane Milton last year surpassed that mark. In a postseason summary of the 2024 hurricane season, NOAA reported Milton's rate of intensification \u2013 90 mph in 24 hours in October 2024 \u2013 was \"among the highest ever observed.\"\nAt least two other hurricanes have exceeded that increase. In 2005, Hurricane Wilma's winds increased 125 mph in 24 hours. In 2007, wind speeds in Hurricane Felix increased by 100 mph in 24 hours.\nHow common are Cat 5s?\nNOAA's database shows slightly more than 40 hurricanes on record have reached wind speeds of 157 mph or more, the minimum threshold for a Category 5 hurricane. However, records show there has been at least one Category 5 hurricane every year since 2022.\nErin became the 11th Category 5 hurricane recorded in the Atlantic since 2016. That is 11 in just nine years, according to University of Oklahoma student and hurricane mapmaker Michael Ferragamo.\nThat's the highest number of Cat 5 hurricanes recorded in a nine-year timeframe on record in a comprehensive database compiled by federal researchers, including the Hurricane Research Division of NOAA's Atlantic and Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory. The database, which dates to 1851, is supported by decades of research into storm records, including ships logs and other historical accounts from the 19th century.\nBy decade, there have been eight Category 5 hurricanes in the Atlantic during the first two decades of this century. There have been five since 2020. Before this century, the greatest number of Cat 5s occurred in the 1930s, when there were six, and the 1960s, when there were five.\nOcean temperatures can contribute to storm strength\nOcean temperatures \u2013 at the surface and below the surface \u2013 can contribute to the rapid intensification of storms, the experts said.\nRecent ocean data indicates Erin may be getting fuel from subsurface temperatures in the ocean, Liu said. \"Subsurface ocean temperature information is critical,\" he added.\nThe latest data indicates temperatures are climbing in the upper layer of the ocean and at the surface.\nThe heat content in the upper layer of the ocean in the main region of the Atlantic where hurricanes develop is lower than at this time last year, but still warmer than normal.\nSea surface temperatures also have warmed in mid-August.\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)\nUSA TODAY journalists Doyle Rice and Dinah Voyles Pulver have covered hurricanes and other violent weather for decades.

      "text": "How to Make a Family Disaster Plan\n07/22/2025\nPlan | Stay Safe \u2022 Earthquakes | Extreme Heat | Floods | Hail | Hurricanes | Lightning | Tornadoes | Tsunamis | Winter Storms\nWhere will your family or household be when disaster strikes? If you are not together when an emergency happens, will everyone know how to stay in contact \u2014 even if cell towers are down and phones don\u2019t work? Do you have a meeting place and will everyone have a way to get there?\nTo develop a family disaster plan, start by mapping out contact methods and meeting places. Then share and practice your plan with your family or household and out-of-town contact. While you develop your plan, keep in mind these specific household needs:\n- Ages of household members\n- Medical needs like prescriptions and equipment\n- Disabilities or access and functional needs\n- Dietary needs\n- Pets or service animals\n- Languages spoken\nAfter you make your plan, all you need to do is revisit and communicate your plan regularly so you\u2019re ready when disaster strikes.\nBuild your plan\n- Write it down.\n- Create a document with the contact information for your family, close friends, designated out-of-town contact, employers, and other service providers like doctors, schools, etc.\n- Plan to communicate.\n- Plan how to communicate with family or friends when disaster strikes.\n- Discuss the benefits of calling, texting, emailing, or using social media. Texting tends to work more reliably than calling, especially when systems are in high demand.\n- Determine how your family will receive emergency updates and alerts.\n- Choose a meeting place.\n- Pick two places to meet your family or household members.\n- Meet outside your home in case of a sudden emergency or at a friend's or neighbor's house in case you can't return home.\n- Ensure that these places are reachable for those with access and functional needs and that your pets are welcome.\n- Share the address and phone number for each of your meet-up locations.\n- Add the information to your phone\u2019s contacts and list them in your plan.\n- Plan to evacuate.\n- If an evacuation is necessary, determine where you will evacuate and how you will get there.\n- If you plan to shelter-in-place, identify the safest location in your home to shelter during a disaster.\n- Identify emergency contact(s).\n- Ask an out-of-town family member or friend to be your emergency contact.\n- Ensure everyone in your household knows the contact\u2019s name, location, phone number, email, and any social media contact options.\n- Schedule a meeting.\n- Set a meeting with your household to talk about the types of disasters and hazards you might face.\n- Work together and share responsibilities as a team.\nKnow your plan\nSend links to your disaster plan and make copies for all family or household members and emergency contacts. Post a copy in a prominent place in your home like a bulletin board.\nPractice the plan\nRegularly gather your family or household members to review and practice your plan. Discuss what information you would communicate during a disaster and send practice messages. Make sure all family members (including children) understand how and when to call 911.\nUpdate your communication plan at least once a year or whenever information changes.\nSpecial Considerations for Families with Children\nA natural disaster is often devastating for adults, but children can be especially vulnerable to stress and anxiety when disaster strikes. Prepare your children before a disaster and plan activities to keep them busy during and after an emergency.\nGetting kids involved in the planning process and letting them plan activities will distribute the workload and give your family a sense of control.\nPreparing Your Children for Disasters\n- Learn what types of emergencies are possible where you live, teach your children about them, and discuss the steps you\u2019ve taken to protect your family and home.\n- Discuss emergencies that may require evacuation, such as a hurricane, and shelter-in-place emergencies, such as a tornado.\n- Include your children when creating your family communication plans and building a disaster supply kit.\n- Have a disaster drill and practice your plan, making sure to give your children a role and way to participate.\n- Prepare fun, kid-friendly activities and games to keep them occupied. Choose games that they do not ordinarily play, so they have something special to enjoy.\n- Select activities that do not require power so you can conserve your batteries and back-up power sources.\nMore Resources"

Thanks to higher resolution satellites, hurricane researchers also know more about the weather patterns that move westward across the Atlantic and Caribbean that could eventually become tropical storms or cyclones.\nKnown as tropical waves, these areas of low pressure \u2013 found in the atmosphere above the surface and not in the ocean \u2013 have always moved across the Atlantic and around the globe.\nForecasters are watching these waves more closely than ever and understand more about how some of them become the seeds of tropical storms and hurricanes, said Kelly N\u00fa\u00f1ez Ocasio, assistant professor in the atmospheric sciences department at Texas A&M University.\nAs a result, the waves also catch the attention of casual observers who find their way to the page where the hurricane center\u2019s highly trained specialists present their discussion of what\u2019s happening across the Atlantic basin. When a tropical wave gets mentioned, there's no immediate cause for alarm or concern.\nMost of the waves \"aren't very noteworthy, and about half of them are almost imperceptible,\" said Chris Landsea, chief of the National Hurricane Center's tropical analysis and forecast branch. They're mostly found in the lower latitudes, along a band across the Caribbean south of the Florida Keys.\nBy themselves, the waves have little impact on states outside Florida to the north, he said. For example, 'the (waves) we\u2019re watching right now (on May 29, 2025) aren't going to be impacting the U.S. at all.\"\nStill, it's \"very important\" for the hurricane center to track tropical waves, Landsea said.\nWhy track tropical waves?\nEven without further development, tropical waves can impact local weather in Florida and the Caribbean by influencing thunderstorms and bringing gustier winds as they approach. The other reason to keep an eye on tropical waves is that some of the strongest that come off the African Coast tend to create the most dangerous hurricanes.\nRoughly 80 tropical waves are found across the Atlantic basin in a given year, said Landsea, who has studied tropical waves for decades.\nBetween 40 and 60 of those emerge off the African Coast during the hurricane season that begins June 1 and ends December 1, said N\u00fa\u00f1ez Ocasio. Fewer than two dozen of these waves become named tropical storms. Even fewer become hurricanes.\nHowever, the waves are particularly important for forecasters to observe because \"most of the hurricanes that get strongest originate from tropical waves,\" Landsea said. An estimated 85% of the most intense hurricanes \u2013 the Category 3's, 4's and 5's, with winds of 111 mph or more \u2013 get their start in the tropical waves that move off the African coast, he said.\nTo become a depression or storm, a tropical wave must encounter a perfect set of conditions in the surrounding ocean and atmosphere that include very warm ocean water, relatively moist air, and a potentially unstable atmosphere.\nMany tropical waves form over Africa\nResearchers such as N\u00fa\u00f1ez Ocasio are working to answer riddles such as what makes some hurricanes larger in size than others and why some waves form hurricanes and others do not. The more they learn, the more the information can be used to improve hurricane forecast models.\nThe stronger waves often begin over the high mountains of Ethiopia in eastern Africa, gathering strength, size and moisture from the monsoon as they move west, said N\u00fa\u00f1ez Ocasio.\nA lot of \"very warm air\" rises over the mountains in an area where the African easterly jet stream enters the region, she said. The resulting convection produces waves that interact with the West African monsoon and the wind energy in the jet, and by the time they reach the western coast, their structure is already more suitable to become a tropical depression, she said.\nIt's only been within the last few years, that researchers have been able to correlate the intensity of a wave coming off Africa with the intensity of any tropical depression it forms, she said. \"Those waves that originate over the Ethiopian highlands are actually the ones more likely to become hurricanes.\"\nHer research proved timely last summer, when an expected busy season kind of stalled out at one point in mid-summer. A very active monsoon ranged over Africa, so intense that it was flooding areas of the Sahara Desert where flooding hadn't been previously seen, she said. The tropical waves and the African jet were pushing farther north and not coming off the coast along the typical Atlantic hurricane track, she said.\nThat pattern may suggest a shift in the peak of Atlantic hurricane season in response to climate change, with waves forming and moving more slowly, and gathering more moisture, she said. \"All the entire tropical atmosphere is changing .... Tropical waves are getting more intense with the changing climate.\"\nLearning about potential tropical systems earlier than in the past is not a reason to worry, but it can be a reason to prepare early, she said. \"It's about thinking twice, decision-making to safeguard life and property.\"\nDinah Voyles Pulver, a national correspondent for USA TODAY, writes about hurricanes, violent weather and other environmental issues.

      "text": "Final hurricane season forecast warns storms are coming soon\nThe Atlantic hurricane season 2025 is entering its peak months and weather conditions continue to favor an above-normal season, just as federal forecasters first predicted in May.\nThe Atlantic hurricane season 2025 is entering its peak months and weather conditions continue to favor an above-normal season, federal forecasters said on Aug. 7 in their final planned Atlantic hurricane season outlook for 2025.\nNOAA said forecasters expect a range of 13 to 18 total named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher). Of those, five to nine are forecast to become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including two to five major hurricanes (Category 3, 4 or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher).\nThis includes the four tropical storms (Andrea, Barry, Chantal and Dexter) that have already formed.\nA typical year averages about 14 tropical storms, seven of which spin into hurricanes, based on weather records that date from 1991 to 2020.\nThe numbers released in the Aug. 7 forecast are a slight decrease from the original forecast in May, though not enough to change the overall message of the forecast.\n'Combination of factors' led to forecast\nAtlantic basin tropical storm activity is expected to be above normal due to a combination of factors, including warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Seas, and an active West African monsoon. (The monsoon's thunderstorm activity over West Africa promotes the formation of African easterly waves, which can turn into tropical storms and hurricanes.)\nENSO-neutral conditions are also expected to continue, meaning there is neither an El Ni\u00f1o nor La Ni\u00f1a to influence this season\u2019s storm activity. (\"ENSO\" is short for \"El Ni\u00f1o - Southern Oscillation,\" the overall term for the El Ni\u00f1o / La Ni\u00f1a climate cycle that affect weather worldwide. \"ENSO-Neutral\" means neither El Ni\u00f1o nor La Ni\u00f1a conditions are present.)\n\u201cMany of the factors we identified ahead of the season are still at play, and conditions are largely tracking along with our May predictions,\u201d said Matt Rosencrans, lead hurricane season forecaster with NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Prediction, part of the National Weather Service.\nWhat do other hurricane season 2025 forecasts say?\nOther top forecasters are also predicting an active season. Colorado State University's hurricane forecasting team, led by Phil Klotzbach, predicted 16 total named storms, of which 8 will be hurricanes, in its most recent forecast released Aug. 6.\nAccuWeather's forecast, which came out in March, calls for 13 to 18 named storms, of which 7 to 10 will be hurricanes.\nThe record for most actual named storms in a season is 30, set in 2020.\nHow to prepare for hurricane danger\nThe best time to prepare for a hurricane is before a storm threatens, NOAA said.\n\u201cAs we enter the second half of the season, this updated hurricane outlook serves as a call to action to prepare now, in advance, rather than delay until a warning is issued,\" said acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm, in a statement.\nIt is vital to understand your home's vulnerability to storm surge, flooding, and wind. Here is your checklist of things to do before a storm threatens your area.\nHere are some USA TODAY links to bookmark on how to prepare your home for a hurricane and how to prepare a go-bag in case you need to evacuate."

      "text": "Powerful Hurricane Erin could mimic damage from earlier hurricanes that stayed offshore\nDozens of hurricanes have made a similar trek in recent years, testing the nerves of millions who wait to see if the storms are destined to make any sharp left turns or wobbles toward the coast.\nHurricane Erin, with powerful winds of more than 160 mph on August 16, is expected to take a path familiar to many as the massive storm moves northward parallel to the United States coast.\nDozens of hurricanes have made a similar trek in recent years, testing the nerves of millions who wait to see if the storms are destined to make any sharp left turns or wobbles toward the coast. Even when they don't brush the coast or make landfall, such storms can be deadly and cause millions of dollars of damage.\nErin is expected to remain hundreds of miles offshore, according to the National Hurricane Center, part of the National Weather Service. As of 5 p.m. Aug. 16, Erin is forecast to be centered roughly 600 miles east of Savannah on Aug. 20.\nBut because Erin is growing both in size and intensity, chances are increasing that it will still create rough conditions at sea and along beaches as it moves northward off the coast, the weather service says.\nMany lives have been lost during hurricanes that remained well offshore but created rough surf or deceptive conditions that can disguise hazardous rip currents. Over a 10-year period, about 10 to 15% of all deaths in tropical storms and hurricanes were attributed to rip currents, according to the hurricane center. That's one reason behind a new public safety campaign NOAA launched earlier this year \u2013 \"Blue IQ.\"\nErin and past storms also clearly demonstrate how dependent we are on overhead weather patterns to steer tropical storms and hurricanes away from the coast. Examples of these patterns include the jet stream and a ridge of high pressure over the Atlantic Ocean, known as the Bermuda High.\nWhat\u2019s the chance Erin could veer closer to the coast?\nWhile the paths of many previous hurricanes have made wobbles or turns toward the coast, as Superstorm Sandy did in 2012, it's unlikely in this case, forecasts say.\nThe hurricane center\u2019s skill at predicting storms \u2013 especially large, well-formed hurricanes \u2013 has improved significantly in recent years. That\u2019s thanks in part to the years of federal science data that have been collected and fed into computer models that assist the center\u2019s hurricane specialists in plotting forecasts.\nThe weather service, including the hurricane center, \"has done a pretty darned good job over the last five years of predicting the path of storms,\" said Rob Young, director of the program for the study of developed shorelines, a joint venture with Duke and Western Carolina universities.\nIn March 2025, the hurricane center announced its 2024 track forecast performance was the best in its history.\nThrough Aug. 21, the locations along the U.S. East Coast with the greatest risks of tropical storm force winds are Nantucket, Massachusetts, and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, where the center lists the risk at 6%. Cape Hatteras has only a 1% chance of experiencing hurricane-force winds and both locations have only a 1% chance of hurricane-force winds.\n'Storms like this can be beach eaters'\nBecause Erin is growing in size, it's increasing the risks for coastal erosion, rip currents and hazardous conditions at the coast, the weather service said. Meteorologists are already warning beachgoers and mariners to pay attention to conditions and forecasts as Erin approaches the offshore waters.\nThe hurricane center warns Erin\u2019s swells are expected to affect portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and the Turks and Caicos through August 17. Swells are then expected to spread into the Bahamas, Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast by August 18 and are likely to create life-threatening surf conditions and rip currents.\n\"These storms that stay offshore like this one is expected to do can still impact over 1,000 miles of coast with waves and a little storm surge,\" Young said. \"They're unlikely to knock down homes, unless those homes are already in the water.\" Such at-risk homes could include structures in southern St. Johns County on Florida's east coast and homes on a section of North Carolina's Outer Banks.\n\"Storms like this can be beach eaters,\" Young said. \"Storms like this can really chew up the sand,\" including on renourished beaches, even if the storms never come ashore, he said. \"Erin may still do what some folks would call damage to the beaches on the order of tens of millions of dollars.\"\nWhich storms took a path similar to Hurricane Erin?\nDozens of storms have traveled north offshore, often curving completely away from the coast without making landfall in the mainland United States or in Canada, but some leave damage in their wakes, in the form of erosion, coastal flooding and even deaths from rough seas. These are some of the more notable storms:\nHurricane Erin: The last time there was a Hurricane Erin was in September 2001. That Erin also traveled a northward path, farther offshore. A NASA satellite photo of the massive hurricane swirling offshore east of North Carolina and Virginia on September 11, 2001, also showed smoke trailing from the site of the attacks on the World Trade Center's twin towers.\nHurricane Bill: In August 2009, even though the hurricane was offshore of the U.S, two people died in large waves and rough seas: a 7-year-old girl in Acadia National Park in Maine and a 54-year-old in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, according to the hurricane center's after-storm report. The strong surf led to multiple rescues along the coast, as well as coastal flooding. The hurricane later made landfall in Newfoundland.\nHurricane Joaquin: Joaquin looped in the Bahamas in late September and early October of 2015, and then traveled northeast. After sailing into Joaquin, the SS El Faro was lost at sea on Oct. 1 and ultimately sunk, killing 33 crew members. A weather system that developed over the Southeast tapped into a steady stream of moisture from Joaquin and created days of rain, while high tides from the hurricane's swells all combined to cause historic flooding in South Carolina, including in Columbia and Charleston, even though the hurricane remained offshore.\nHurricane Lorenzo: Like Erin, 2019's Hurricane Lorenzo rapidly intensified and became a major hurricane. Even though it was centered much farther to the east in the Atlantic, Lorenzo created massive swells that caused \"hazardous surf and rip currents along U.S. beaches for several days,\" the hurricane center said. Eight people died in the storm's rough surf and rip currents, four in North Carolina, one in Florida, two in New York and one in Rhode Island.\nWhat's a 'fish storm?'\nMany hurricane veterans jokingly refer to hurricanes and tropical storms that remain offshore as \"fish storms,\" because they remain over the open ocean. However, Brian LaMarre, a veteran meteorologist who recently retired from the weather service, said this week there's \"a great deal more than fish out there\" given the dense shipping traffic and commerce networks offshore.\nImpacts from the waves and long-period swells can be \"incredibly disruptive and can extend hundreds of miles outward from these ocean storm systems,\" LaMarre said.\nTrack Erin's progress\nDinah Voyles Pulver covers climate change and the environment for USA TODAY.
