  "title": "Blitz Electric Mobility, Indonesia's Leading EV Logistic Enabler, secures Pre-Series A Investment Led by Vynn Capital",
  "description": "Blitz Electric Mobility (Blitz), Indonesia's leading EV logistics enabler, has closed a Pre-Series A funding round led by Malaysia-based Vynn Capital.",
  "content": "This investment marks Vynn Capital's ongoing commitment through its mobility and supply chain fund, with participation from existing Blitz investor Iterative Capital. The round also brings in notable new backers, including former Andreessen Horowitz general partner Balaji Srinivasan, ex\u2011PayPal exec Rajesh Venkatesh, and Vinner Ventures. These add to Blitz's roster of impact-driven institutional investors such as Asian Development Bank (ADB) Ventures, FiveFortyAlpha, BonBillo Fund, and Peak XV.\n\nBlitz's asset-light, tech-first approach places it at the forefront of sustainable logistics in Indonesia's last-mile delivery market. The company addresses three critical challenges: meeting instant delivery demands, overcoming the complexities of scaling in-house logistics, and enabling cleaner, electrified infrastructure. Blitz empowers businesses with scalable, same-day, and instant delivery without the need to own or manage their own fleet assets.\n\nBlitz operates a growing pool of thousands of gig couriers, providing tailored B2B logistics solutions that include:\n\nUnlike other players, Blitz has built a unique model designed for sustainable margins, long-term client partnerships, and embedded EV financing for gig workers.\n\nIn 2024, Blitz had tripled its revenue while cutting its burn rate by over 70%, significantly optimising its operational costs. With a disciplined strategy, the company has achieved substantial profitability improvements.\n\nNow entering a new chapter of disciplined, sustainable growth, Blitz plans to use its secured funding to accelerate expansion across Indonesia. With a sharper focus on efficiency, quality clients, and scalable operations, the company is aligning its resources to drive stronger unit economics and long-term value. This renewed strategy positions Blitz to move confidently toward profitability while continuing to deliver impact at scale.\n\n\"The initial growth phase is behind us. Now, our focus is disciplined scaling. That means maximizing what works and discontinuing what doesn't,\" said Saivya Chauhan, Founder and CEO of Blitz. \"This funding reflects confidence in our proven model and positions us to secure capital aligned with our long-term objectives,\" added William So, Co-Founder and CFO of Blitz.",
