  "content": "The remains of a British researcher who fell into a crevasse on an Antarctic glacier 66 years ago have been recovered, the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) said.\n\nDennis Bell, then 25, vanished into the ice on July 26, 1959 while climbing the Ecology glacier on King George Island, one of the South Shetland Islands that lie north of the Antarctic Peninsula. He survived the initial fall \u2013 estimated to have been 100 feet \u2013 but an attempt to rescue him failed, and he wasn\u2019t seen again.\n\nIn January, a team from the Polish base on King George Island found his remains and hundreds of personal items among rocks uncovered as the glacier has retreated, the BAS said.\n\nThe Polish team carried out an extensive archaeological survey over five days in February, recovering bone fragments and man-made artifacts \u2013 including a watch with an engraved inscription, a Swedish knife, radio equipment and ski poles.\n\nDNA samples were matched with Bell\u2019s living siblings David Bell and Valerie Kelly, who were surprised by the discovery.\n\n\u201cWhen my sister Valerie and I were notified that our brother Dennis had been found after 66 years we were shocked and amazed,\u201d David Bell told BAS. He expressed the family\u2019s gratitude to the British and Polish team for \u201cbringing him home,\u201d saying the discovered had helped them \u201ccome to terms with the tragic loss of our brilliant brother.\u201d\n\nKnown by the nickname \u201cTink,\u201d Bell joined the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) \u2013 the predecessor of the BAS \u2013 as a meteorologist in 1958, seeking more adventure after a career with the Royal Air Force.\n\n\u201cThis discovery brings closure to a decades-long mystery and reminds us of the human stories embedded in the history of Antarctic science,\u201d said BAS director Dame Jane Francis, who added that it was \u201cpoignant and profound moment.\u201d\n\nBell was stationed at a small British base with of only half a dozen men in King George Island\u2019s Admiralty Bay, where the sea ices over for nine months of the year.\n\nOn July 26, 1959, Bell and three other men set out on dog sledges to climb the glacier on the island\u2019s peak to carry out survey and geological work, with Bell and surveyor Jeff Stokes departing about 30 minutes before the other group.\n\nThe snow was deep and the dogs had begun to show signs of fatigue, so Bell walked ahead to encourage them, but he was not wearing his skis. Suddenly, he disappeared into the ice.\n\nStokes called down a hole in the ice and was \u201cgreatly relieved\u201d to hear Bell answer, according to an account from former BAS Director Sir Vivian Fuchs in Antony Nelson\u2019s book \u201cOf Ice and Men.\u201d\n\nStokes then lowered a rope almost 100 feet into the hole, told Bell to tie himself onto it\ufeff, and attached it to the dog sled, in an ill-fated attempt to lift him out, recounted Fuchs.\n\n\u201cBell had tied the rope through his belt instead of round his body, perhaps because of the angle at which he lay in the crevasse. As he reached the top his body jammed against the lip, the belt broke, and down he went again,\u201d Fuchs said.\n\nBell never responded to his friend\u2019s calls after that.\n\nStokes left markers at the site and started making his way down the glacier to find the other team of men. After 12 hours, in deteriorating weather, they eventually returned to the site and determined there was no way he could have been saved.\n\n\u201cDennis was one of the many brave FIDS personnel who contributed to the early science and exploration of Antarctica under extraordinarily harsh conditions,\u201d said Francis, the BAS Director.\n\n\u201cEven though he was lost in 1959, his memory lived on among colleagues and in the legacy of polar research.\u201d\n\nAfter being recovered by the Polish team, his remains were taken to the Falkland Islands on the BAS Research Ship the Sir David Attenborough where they were handed to the Coroner for British Antarctic Territory and transported to London.",
