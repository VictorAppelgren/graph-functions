      "feedback": "Actionable feedback to upgrade to world-class quality: tighten the causal chain with a crisp, first-principles model (unemployment risk U, demand upgrade D, policy support P) that maps Regime A/B/C to a bounded, data‑driven asset-price transmission (e.g., U up suppresses D, P lifts D and capex, which reprices durable/income exposures); anchor this in the material’s numbers (e.g., 25% automation exposure and 36M affected [NL5YYTLF2], Ford EV losses ~$1.3B and 5% dividend [22PL3Q360/W2622L6WW], Regime probabilities ~50/30/20 [NL5YYTLF2], Nvidia/Ford/ACMR ties) and consistently cite IDs for every numeric claim. Ensure the Movers lines are exactly 4 lines with 2 Up and 2 Down, and assign explicit probabilities aligned to the regime-probability evidence (Up lines → Regime A ~50%; Down 3–6m → Regime B ~30%; Down 0–3w → Regime C ~20%), with a precise “What to watch” that includes numeric thresholds (e.g., Nvidia quarterly capex growth, Ford Q2 EV losses, EV capex milestones). Recast the Outlook to one line if tradable, or two max if needed, with the required fields (Direction | Horizon | Entry/Stop/Target/R-R/Invalidation/Trigger/Prob|Confidence) and format them strictly as Percentages; fix missing fields and formatting (Probability % | Confidence %; no bare numbers). Increase citation density by attaching IDs to every factual claim, reconcile competing narratives (e.g., Ford’s EV profitability vs Fool/Yahoo framing) by listing both viewpoints under “watch-list” with explicit data points, and add explicit invalidation triggers (e.g., Regime shift signals, policy misstep, or a material earnings inflection failure). Finally, purge filler, align every line to the 0–3 weeks / 0–3 months / 3–6 months windows with consistent units, and keep all assertions within the provided source IDs (NL5YYTLF2; STBVARD8F; SGB2PAZGK; 22PL3Q360; W2622L6WW; 0J41Q7KTX; LLN6N4H3Z; U6HXAJR4J; 1GVYF2V8O; etc.).",
