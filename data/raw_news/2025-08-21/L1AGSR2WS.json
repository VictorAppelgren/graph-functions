Lee Scholarship. Ten awardees individually received at least $5,000 in scholarships to fund their undergraduate or graduate education. This scholarship aims to encourage more students to choose a profession within the affordable housing space. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Todd A. Lee Scholarship by awarding 10 deserving individuals during this academic school year. These students are already making an impact and setting high standards, making them the promising leaders of tomorrow. Todd A. Lee would be happy knowing that we have a generation of future leaders ready to foster and thrive within this affordable housing ecosystem.\u201d stated Christopher E. Donald, Executive Director/CEO of DCHFA.\n\nAll students are natives of the District or D.C. residents, which is one of the scholarship program requirements.\n\n\u00b7 Keicha Barnes, Graduate Student/Computer Engineering Concentration at the University of the District of Columbia\n\n\u00b7 Natalie Washington, Graduate Student/Real Estate Concentration at the University of Maryland\n\n\u00b7 Marissa Garland, Business/Finance Major at the University of the District of Columbia\n\nTodd A. Lee was the Executive Director and CEO of DCHFA from 2016 to 2020. During his lifetime, his career focus was innovation, infrastructure/process, and financing in real estate. He came to DCHFA to create an impact in the city through the preservation and construction of affordable and workforce housing in the District of Columbia. As an extension of the Lee Legacy, DCHFA launched the scholarship in 2020 for students who aspire to have a career in the field of affordable housing. Since its inception, 39 recipients (including repeat awardees) have been awarded over $280,000 in funds toward their education. TAL Scholars have gone on to careers within the District government (Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development and Department of Housing and Community Development) as well as with organizations such as Intuit Inc., Volunteers of America, and Capital Impact Partners.",
