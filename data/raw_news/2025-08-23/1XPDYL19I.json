  "title": "Thursday Murder Club star Helen Mirren shares thoughts on rumoured sequel",
  "description": "The Thursday Murder Club has just come out in cinemas and fans are already speculating about a sequel.",
  "content": "The Thursday Murder Club's leading lady, Helen Mirren, has shared her thoughts on the potential future of the Netflix adaptation. The film is based on Richard Osman's best-selling 2020 murder mystery novel, The Thursday Murder Club, which has been brought to life on the big screen by Home Alone director Chris Columbus. Speculation has been rife about a possible sequel, given that Osman has penned four books in The Thursday Murder Club series and a fifth is due next month. The second book, The Man Who Died Twice, was released in 2021. While there's plenty of material for a follow-up film, no official announcement has been made yet. However, Oscar-winning actress Mirren told Radio Times she'd be more than happy to return if a sequel gets the go-ahead.\n\nWhen quizzed on whether she'd reprise her role, she responded: \"In a nanosecond. And it would be the team getting back together, which would be great. \"We did have a wonderful time shooting this. So all of us would jump at the chance, quite honestly.\" Columbus has hinted that plans are underway for another film, revealing during a chat with Film Stories about one particular scene: \"I don't want to talk about the beginning of that scene, because the beginning will actually be utilised \u2013 if we're lucky enough, and all signs seem to point in that direction that we will be shooting a sequel or the next chapter \u2013 in the second movie.\" So it appears fans might witness considerably more of the amateur detectives in times ahead.\n\nSituated at the breathtaking fictional retirement community of Coopers Chase, pensioners Elizabeth Chase (portrayed by Helen Mirren), Ron Ritchie (Pierce Brosnan), Ibrahim Arif (Ben Kingsley) and Joyce Meadowcroft (Celia Imrie) relish investigating long-forgotten cold murder cases. When a property developer unexpectedly perishes, the group decides to discover who the murderer is that requires apprehending. Beyond the mind-bending storyline, The Thursday Murder Club boasts a wealth of stars alongside the principal quartet of performers, featuring David Tennant, Naomi Ackie and Henry Lloyd-Hughes. Osman's spouse, actress and comedienne Ingrid Oliver, also plays an important role, playing Joyce's daughter Joanna Meadowcroft. The Thursday Murder Club is available to watch in cinemas and will be ready to watch on Thursday, August 28, on Netflix.",
