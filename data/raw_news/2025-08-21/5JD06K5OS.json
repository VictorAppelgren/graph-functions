  "content": "Selena Gomez's cosmetic line has released a set of new, mouthwatering products.\n\nOn Aug. 21, Rare Beauty and Taji\u0301n released their Cheek & Lip Set, a liquid blush and lip gloss inspired by the shades of Taji\u0301n Cla\u0301sico Seasoning and Taji\u0301n Chamoy Sauce. The limited-edition set features a 0.25 fluid ounce bottle of Soft Pinch Liquid Blush in Chamoy, a deep red brown, and a 0.11 fluid ounce bottle of Positive Light Luminizing Lip Gloss in Cla\u0301sico, a terracotta with copper and gold shimmers, the latter of which is a brand new product to Rare Beauty's line.\n\nTaji\u0301n Cla\u0301sico Seasoning is made with chili peppers, lime and sea salt, and chamoy is a type of Spanish sauce that is often made of dried fruit like apricot, mango or plum, chili peppers and lime juice.\n\n\"The way my sisters and I would play with chamoy as lip gloss growing up,\" an Instagram user commented on Rare Beauty and Taji\u0301n's post promoting the collaboration. \"Amoooo (love).\"\n\nHere's what to know about the new spicy collaboration.\n\nThe Rare Beauty x Taji\u0301n Cheek & Lip Set is available for purchase on the Rare Beauty and Sephora websites, while supplies last. Customers are limited to two sets per order.\n\nHow much is the Rare Beauty x Taji\u0301n Cheek & Lip Set?\n\nThe Rare Beauty x Taji\u0301n Cheek & Lip Set is $30. The items cannot be purchased individually.\n\nDo the beauty products contain Taji\u0301n?\n\nNo, the liquid blush and lip gloss do not contain Taji\u0301n. Neither product tastes like Taji\u0301n either, a Taji\u0301n news release clarifies. A full ingredient list for either product can be found on Rare Beauty's website.\n\nRare Beauty and Taji\u0301n fans alike appear taken aback but intrigued by the collaboration.\n\n\"I'm not even a Rare Beauty fan like that, but I'm very tempted to get this for the gloss,\" TikTok user Savannah said in a video posted on Aug. 21.\n\n\"This is made in heaven, honey,\" TikTok user Sebastian Soto said in a recent video. \"As someone who loves Taji\u0301n, I've put Taji\u0301n on just about everything ... from popcorn to ice cream to sour candy to freaking bananas.

      "text": "e.l.f. Cosmetics, under fire for Matt Rife ad, says 'we missed the mark'\nMove over, American Eagle: popular beauty company e.l.f. Cosmetics is the latest brand to come under fire for an ad campaign.\nThe budget beauty brand shared the campaign on Aug. 11, starring comedian Matt Rife and drag queen Heidi N Closet playing the role of lawyers.\nThe video is set at the fictional \u201cLaw Offices of e.l.f.ino & Schmarnes,\" a play on the real-life law firm Cellino & Barnes. In a parody of the real firm's iconic commercials of the 1990s and 2000s, Rife and Closet act as \u201caffordable beauty attorneys\" who have gone to \"e.l.f. court for millions of clients, helping them to access beauty products they deserve at prices that won\u2019t injure their livelihoods.\"\n\u201cI know a thing or two about red flags. And pricey makeup? You deserve better than that,\u201d Rife says in the ad, which ends with the pair encouraging viewers to call \u201c1-855-COLD-HARD-LASH.\"\nMany fans quickly took issue with the inclusion of Rife, who has previously sparked controversy and backlash from women, particularly after a domestic violence joke he made in his debut Netflix special. Here's what to know about the latest incident involving e.l.f.\nWho is Matt Rife and why is he controversial?\nRife, 29, gained widespread popularity in 2022 when videos of his stand-up comedy, specifically his crowd work, went viral on TikTok. He had previously appeared in a few small roles on reality and traditional television, making it to the semifinals of the comedy competition show \"Bring the Funny\" in 2019.\nRife had ruffled some feathers with his quips over the years, but the real backlash came with the release of his Netflix special \"Natural Selection\" in November 2023. The special, which received mixed reviews, was what Rife himself described as an attempt at appealing to a male audience after his rise to fame was largely attributed to female supporters.\n\"And that's one thing that I wanted to tackle in this special was showing people that, like, despite what you think about me online, I don't pander my career to women,\" he said in an interview with Variety. \"I would argue this special is way more for guys.\"\nRife opened the special with a joke about domestic violence, telling a story about visiting a \"ratchet\" restaurant in Baltimore with his friend and noticing a female server had a black eye. As the story goes, the duo wondered why the establishment wouldn't keep the server in the kitchen to avoid customers seeing her injury.\n\"Yeah, but I feel like if she could cook, she wouldn\u2019t have that black eye,\" he quipped. \"I figure if we start the show with domestic violence, the rest of the show should be smooth sailing.\"\nContinued backlash\nRife's response to subsequent backlash landed him in even deeper water when he posted a fake apology on his Instagram story. \"If you\u2019ve ever been offended by a joke I\u2019ve told, here\u2019s a link to my official apology,\" he wrote alongside a link that led to a website selling \"special needs helmets.\"\nThese jokes, paired with several others disparaging women throughout the special, left a bad taste in the mouths of people who were once his core audience. Rife, who later faced a controversy over allegedly making inappropriate comments to a 6-year-old child online, acknowledged again on an episode of the \"BFF's Pod\" podcast that while women were responsible for his success, he was steering away from catering to that audience.\n\"Without women, I would've never gained the momentum I did on social media, and I'm so grateful for that,\" he said. \"But in doing that, a lot of dudes didn't like that. ... I feel like my comedy is more for guys than women.\"\ne.l.f controversy\nRife's alienation of his female audience is the crux of the criticism surrounding e.l.f.'s new ad campaign. With the brand and its products being overwhelmingly targeted at women, fans expressed confusion with Rife's involvement.\nEven without taking his past comments into consideration, said some netizens, Rife has never before been associated with makeup, cosmetics or the beauty space, unlike his commercial co-star.\n\"Elf Cosmetics says on their 'elf cares' site that elf stands for empowering legendary females while also simultaneously hiring someone who makes light of DV,\" said one commenter underneath e.l.f.'s YouTube upload of the ad. \"You can't claim diversity and feeling safe and inclusion while also wasting your marketing budget.\"\n\"Literally any other guy could have done this, Matt rife sucks,\" said another.\n\"So\u2026 Rife was the only one y\u2019all could get?\" said one more.\n\"You didn\u2019t have the budget for a comedian who doesn\u2019t joke about abuse?\" said a commenter under the brand's Instagram post. Another wrote, \"Oooooh. Matt Rife? The guy who jokes about DV? In an ad targeted to women? That\u2019s, um. A choice.\" One commenter half-joked, \"Who will you hire next? Andrew Tate? You just lost a lot of customers.\"\nCalls to boycott the brand have taken off on several social media platforms, with beauty influencers, including those who have previously partnered with e.l.f., leading the charge. Some even posted videos of themselves throwing out their e.l.f. products.\nCreators like James Welsh, Katie Raymond, Jillie Clark and Nikkie de Jager made videos and comments decrying the choice and publicly rescinding support for the brand.\ne.l.f. responds to backlash\ne.l.f. released a statement on its Instagram account on Aug. 15, offering an apology to its customers.\n\u201cYou know us, we\u2019re always listening and we\u2019ve heard you,\u201d it said. \u201cThis campaign aimed to humorously spotlight beauty injustice. We understand we missed the mark with people we care about in our e.l.f. community. while e.l.f.ino & schmarnes closes today, we'll continue to make the case against overpriced beauty.\"\nThe post, which received more than 64k likes, was flooded with more than 6,000 comments, many of which were not satisfied with the veracity of the apology.\n\"\u2018Missed the mark\u2019 is a pretty loose way of saying \u2018we intentionally alienated our audience by hiring a man who torpedoed his career by alienating his audience,'\" said one comment with more than 8,000 likes. \"Are you seriously trying to add humour to your apology? Take down the original ads from all platforms. How tone deaf can you be?\" said another.\ne.l.f. Beauty\u2019s Global Chief of Marketing Officer Kory Marchisotto told trade publication The Business of Beauty in an Aug. 14 interview that the brand was \"surprised\" by the poor reception.\n\"Obviously we\u2019re very surprised,\u201d said Marchisotto, who explained that they chose Rife because of the alignment between his TikTok followers and the brand's target audience. \u201cThere is a big gap between our intention and how this missed the mark for some people.\"\n\"We always aim to deliver positivity, and this one didn\u2019t. So we find ourselves in a position where, quite honestly, that doesn\u2019t feel good for us,\" she said.\nUSA TODAY has reached out to e.l.f. and Rife for comment."

Known as \"shooters,\" \"tasters\" or \"nips,\" these pocket-size tequila bottles will come in Reposado and Blanco, according to an 818 Tequila news release.\nThe minis are a part of a campaign Tequila 818 has called \"Free the Nip.\"\n\"No longer confined to minibars or airplane carts, the 818 Minis are now more versatile and spontaneous, clipped to your purse, going where you go,\" the news release states.\nTo launch the minis, 818 Tequila is partnering with Gopuff, the around-the-clock delivery service.

      "text": "She turned herself into an 'LA 10.' It's part of a growing 'unrecognizable makeup' trend.\nShe\u2019s an \u201cLos Angeles 10\u201d but a \u201cChicago 7.\u201d A \u201cNew York 9\u201d but a \"Miami 5.\"\nThat might be meaningless at first glance, but these taglines are part of a growing \u201cunrecognizable makeup\u201d trend on TikTok, in which makeup looks are so transformative that they make the wearer appear to be an entirely different person.\nTikTok creator @lottiestarrs has been spearheading the \"LA 10\" trend. In a video with nearly 60 million views, she goes from pink-haired and barefaced to a blonde bombshell, transforming downturned eyes into a smoky, upturned look with a heart-shaped lip. She \u201cgot bored one night,\u201d and in another video with 22 million views, turned herself into an \u201cLA 10\u201d \u2013 not only looking unrecognizable from the previous clip, but completely different from her other \"unrecognizable makeup\u201d looks.\nPraise flooded her comments section: \u201cGirl this is talent \u2026 art even,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cI stood and applauded,\u201d quipped another.\nOther creators hopped on the trend, including Marylyn Chukwuekezie, a beauty content creator based in Nigeria. She recreated celebrity makeup looks \u2013 from SZA to Sabrina Carpenter (her favorite look so far) \u2013 and used wigs, contour, blush and eye makeup to turn herself into an \"LA 10.\"\nDebates around makeup and \u201cundetectable plastic surgery\u201d have already been popping up on social media. Last year, Lindsay Lohan and Christina Aguilera shocked fans with fresh looks. Now, makeup is entering the conversation.\nIn July, \u201cBridgerton\u201d Netflix star Charithra Chandran stole Andrew Garfield\u2019s spotlight at Wimbledon after a video of her seated behind him went viral. But the replies just as quickly turned sour when the internet began picking apart Chandran\u2019s appearance, posting side-by-side photos of her with and without makeup, calling her \"mid\" and accusing her of having filler and plastic surgery.\nSome people are upset about these unrecognizable looks. However, others argue that it's all in good fun and we shouldn't take everything on the internet quite so seriously.\nMakeup is an \u2018enhancement\u2019 and \u2018art\u2019\nThe problematic joke, \u201cTake her swimming on the first date,\u201d has been around for nearly a decade \u2013 it\u2019s tossed around by men who claim that seeing a woman without makeup early on is the only way to avoid getting \u201cbamboozled\u201d into dating someone unattractive.\nIn 2021, actress Sydney Sweeney \u2013 who has often been praised for her looks (and is recently the subject of heated debates over her American Eagle ad) \u2013 cried on Instagram Live while trending on X (then, Twitter) for \u201cbeing ugly.\" In October 2024, Sweeney was photographed on set with a brunette curly wig, baggy clothing and no apparent makeup. Then, she was featured in an X thread with 11 million views titled \u201cCatfish of the Year,\u201d comparing a photo of her on a red carpet to candid paparazzi shots.\nAnother user came to her defense: \u201c\u2018Sydney Sweeney is a catfish\u2019 sir if you cannot recognize that a blonde woman does not wake up with jet black eyelashes and face glitter then you might be too stupid to reach.\u201d\nMany women have pushed back against criticism of makeup, arguing that makeup is \u201cart\u201d and not \u201ca form of lying.\u201d\n\"A beautiful woman, we\u2019ve been taught, is beautiful naturally with no visible effort on her part,\" Leora Tanenbaum, author of \"Sexy Selfie Nation,\" previously told USA TODAY. \"But we all know that it\u2019s impossible to conform to our societal beauty ideals with no effort.\"\nChukwuekezie likes the way she looks without makeup, but wearing it gives her a confidence boost.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel less pretty when I\u2019m not wearing makeup, but I actually do feel more pretty when I\u2019m wearing makeup,\u201d she says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t affect the way I see myself; it\u2019s like an enhancement. It\u2019s a form of art for me, and I just love doing makeup.\u201d\nWhen criticism goes too far\nChukwuekezie says people upset about a lighthearted makeup trend are taking it a step too far.\n\"Makeup does enhance your features, but it doesn\u2019t change your features,\" she says. \"It still doesn't mean that the person wearing makeup is wearing makeup because she feels ugly.\"\nEven amid praise in her comment sections, she admits that there are always people saying, \"You're not doing it right.\"\nOthers have speculated that she is using makeup to emulate Eurocentric features. \"I don't even understand that at all,\" she says. \"I have to be like, 'Calm down.'\"\n\"I had a comment that was, 'LA 10 girls are skinny, white and blonde or brunette,'\" she continues. \"I\u2019m like, sorry, I don\u2019t think this has anything to do with the makeup.\""

      "text": "\ud83d\udcf2 This week's viral TikTok finds: Rare Beauty's new perfume, a drink holder bag\nConsider this your weekly guide to the internet's trendiest products across beauty, wellness, travel and beyond.\nMy TikTok feed was a total dream this week: Shopping inspiration everywhere, Taylor and Travis videos flooding my \"For You\" page, my favorite creators whipping out their fall decor and declaring that summer is officially over (thank God). It was like my entire personality\u2014for better or worse\u2014got condensed into one app.\nAnd in the midst of it all, I even found myself falling in love with (and inevitably buying) some of the trending items on TikTok Shop.\nAmong this week's best-sellers were a crossbody bag with a built-in cup holder (for the Stanley-obsessed), a portable telescope with a phone attachment (for the nature-obsessed) and a gourmand new fragrance from Rare Beauty (for the Selena Gomez-obsessed).\nBelow, I break down all of this week's most viral TikTok Shop finds that are worth checking out\u2014and the ones that I'll be skipping:\nShop this week's most viral TikTok finds\n1. A bag with a built-in drink holder\nCan't leave your house without a Stanley tumbler? You're far from alone. Perhaps that's why TikTok shoppers can't get enough of this Behaesty Adjustable Crossbody Bag, which features a built-in drink holder big enough to hold any bulky tumbler.\nMy verdict? After years of exhausting my right arm and forcing it to lug around a hefty Stanley tumbler, this bag will definitely provide some welcomed relief\u2014plus, it's super cute.\n2. Take your office setup to new heights\nElevate your work day setup (literally) with the help of this TikTok-loved Sweetcrispy Electric Standing Desk, which has electric and adjustable height functions, making it easier for you to get off your butt and into a more comfortable working position throughout the day.\nMy verdict? As the proud owner of a standing desk, I can confirm that it's truly the greatest thing in the world\u2014by far the greatest investment I've made as a remote worker. Pro tip if you buy this baby: Slide a walking pad underneath it and you'll be able to get your daily steps in during the work day.\n3. A perfume made for everyone\nIt isn't just the gourmand scent that's getting people talking about this new Rare Beauty Eau de Parfum from Selena Gomez's beauty brand\u2014it's the bottle's ergonomic design, which was made in partnership with certified hand therapists to create a product that's more widely accessible, no matter your disability.\nMy verdict? If this perfume is anything like Rare Beauty's infamous liquid blush, then a little should go a long way. Looks like I've got a new fragrance to add to my perfume cabinet!\n4. A must-have for cozy season\nWinter will be here before you know it, and just as portable air conditioners proved to be an essential this summer, portable heaters are proving to be a must-have for cooler temperatures, too. TikTok's favorite model at the moment? This Vevor 5-AKW Diesel Air Heater.\nMy verdict? Living in Arizona where average winter temperatures are about 65 degrees, I'm basically the last person who needs this air heater in her home\u2014BUT as someone who frequently camps in brisk, mountainous environments, this will definitely come in handy as a mini furnace for my camping tent.\n5. A portable telescope\nYou'll see life in a whole new way with this Monocular Telescope and Phone Clip. Users love it for animal-spotting on hikes, while camping or just in any outdoor environment.\nMy verdict? After spending over $600 on a National Geographic telescope a few years back, I'm genuinely disappointed I didn't know about this portable mini telescope sooner; if reviews are to be believed, it's just as effective and even comes with a clippable accessory so it can attach to your phone. Moral of the story: ALWAYS look to TikTok Shop first before making a big buy.\nHow do I determine the most viral TikTok products?\nThere are a couple factors I take into consideration when narrowing down the best TikTok products on any given week, including: Which product categories are trending on TikTok? Is there an organic discourse surrounding individual items? Are there product reviews from shoppers that can support the hype surrounding a popular TikTok product? Understanding the functionality of an item\u2014beyond just its virality\u2014is critical in assessing its value, and I ensure that any products recommended here are also backed by USA Today Shopping editors, shoppers and boast no lower than a 4.0 average rating."

Here's what to know\nOne of the most widely-streamed shows in the United States will face a shift in production after Paramount Global and Skydance Media merged, creating a standalone entertainment company known simply as Paramount.\n\"Reacher,\" which stars Alan Ritchson as Jack Reacher, is set to be produced by Paramount Television Studios as a result of the move, as well as its upcoming spinoff, \"Neagley.\"\n\"Reacher\" follows a retired military police officer as he navigates a web of conspiracies, shiesty businessmen, and politicians who are not what they seem. The show is based on multiple novels by author Lee Child, including \u201cKilling Floor,\" \"Bad Luck and Trouble,\" and \"Persuader.\"\nThe show's first season is one of the top five most watched original seasons ever in the U.S. and globally on Prime Video, according to Amazon MGM Studios.\nAlso part of the Reacher universe is actress Maria Sten as Frances Neagley, a member of the U.S. Army 110th MP Special Investigations Unit Reacher puts together.

And now, due to the merger, the shows will be produced again by Paramount Television Studios as a single studio.\nAnother show that\u2019ll be impacted by the merger is \u201cCross,\u201d starring Aldis Hodge as Washington, D.C. detective Alex Cross.
