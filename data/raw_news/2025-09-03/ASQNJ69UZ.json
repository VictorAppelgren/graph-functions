  "content": "Leading digital asset service provider Binance has just established itself in Hong Kong with the listing of Binance Coin .\n\nThe cryptocurrency received support from Hong Kong\u2019s licensed exchange OSL HK. This is the first Hong Kong crypto exchange to extend such support to the coin.\n\nChangpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao confirmed that BNB is now the fifth approved digital currency to trade on an exchange in the Asian country. OSL HK welcomed the move, highlighting BNB\u2019s strong utility and efficiency as a leading digital asset.\n\nBased on its announcement, the Asian crypto exchange recognizes the increased institutional demand for cryptocurrencies and their related products. There is also the case of the expanding mainstream investment opportunities.\n\nListing BNB is one of its approaches towards ensuring that it contributes significantly to bridging this gap between traditional finance (TradFi) systems and digital assets.\n\nTrading BNB on OSL HK commenced on September 3, 2025, at 3:00 PM (UTC+8), starting with BNB/USD, BNB/USDT, and BNB/USDC trading pairs. These pairs will be available only to Professional Investors (PI). CZ also noted in his X post that the offering is currently for institutional traders and not available to retail investors.\n\nHaving BNB on OSL HK is a huge reflection of the coin\u2019s growing mainstream recognition, as well as its efficiency and utility.\n\nIn addition, it underscores Binance\u2019s clamor for jurisdictions with a robust regulatory framework. The exchange consistently works towards achieving compliance in jurisdictions where it has its operations.\n\nThis integration with the Hong Kong crypto exchange will likely pull more traction to BNB. BNB is currently trading at $853.71 with a 0.53% decline over the last 24 hours.\n\nThe coin has seen a 12.61% growth in the last 30 days, while its market capitalization is now at $118.83 billion.\n\nIn light of institutional adoption, leading Web3 solutions provider Nano Labs announced that Jianping Kong, its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, purchased 480,000 Class A ordinary shares a week ago, as part of the firm\u2019s BNB strategy. The firm has just undergone a significant shift, adopting BNB as its primary reserve asset.\n\nNot too long after, REX Shares, in conjunction with Osprey Funds, filed for a BNB staking ETF. More institutional investors are now taking a chance on BNB as a reserve asset in their corporate treasuries.\n\nFor the last few weeks, analysts and market observers have been watching, waiting for BNB to flip its price level and hit $1,000. Popular analyst Bitbull already acknowledged the multi-year resistance level flip that the coin underwent, stating $1,000 BNB is \u201cjust a matter of time.\u201d",

      "text": "BNB investors have started their bullish speculations after the REX Shares announcement late Tuesday, Aug. 26.\nBloomberg\u2019s senior exchange-traded fund analyst Eric Balchunas posted on X that REX Shares, a Miami-based ETF provider specializing in alternative-strategy investment products, has filed for the BNB Staking ETF.\nInvest in Gold\nBalchunas shared a screenshot of a filing for REX-Osprey BNB Staking ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\nThe filing came after BNB reached an all-time high of $900 on Aug. 23. The BSC-based token soon saw a selloff to $840 and is currently trading at $858.\nWhile the REX-Osprey BNB Staking ETF can act as a major catalyst for the asset, similar to the Solana Staking ETF, BNB is still seeing weak fundamental and technical indicators.\nFirstly, BSC\u2019s decentralized finance total value locked just reached above $7.5 billion, but it\u2019s still far away from its ATH of nearly $22 billion, according to data from DefiLlama.\nThe flagship protocol and decentralized exchange on the network, PancakeSwap, has been seeing between 80% and 90% lower fees and revenue over the past month. The protocol\u2019s daily fees declined from $5.15 million on July 28 to roughly $500,000 over the past 24 hours.\nThis shows a notable decline in the platform\u2019s usage.\nMoreover, according to the crypto analyst known as Sloo Reviews on X, traders are currently watching the $800 to $820 zone for BNB despite the announcement from REX Shares.\nThe analyst hinted at the massive $1 billion BNB treasury plans by YZi Labs but claimed that the asset is \u201cat a critical point.\u201d\nIf BNB loses the $800 mark, the altcoin will likely see a strong selloff from the investors.\nRead original story REX Shares Files for BNB Staking ETF, Can BNB Hit $900? by Wahid Pessarlay at Coinspeaker.com"

      "text": "Leading Web3 solutions provider, Nano Labs, announced that its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jianping Kong, purchased 480,000 Class A ordinary shares.\nThe purchase was made in August 2025 through open-market transactions using his personal funds.\nThis marks the third time in just over a year that Kong has increased his holdings, following earlier purchases in May and September 2024.\nNano Labs noted that these transactions are strictly under its internal trading policies and comply with all relevant laws and regulations.\nIn a statement, Kong explained that cryptocurrency and Web3 industries are rapidly evolving and Nano Labs is positioning itself for long-term growth.\nThe CEO reaffirmed his belief in the company\u2019s crypto-asset reserves strategy, which currently includes Binance Coin and Bitcoin . He also hinted at more personal investments in the future.\nNano Labs\u2019 Shift to BNB Reserves\nNano Labs has recently undergone a significant shift, adopting BNB as its primary reserve asset.\nSince Q2 2025, the company has accumulated roughly 128,000 BNB tokens, valued at over US $108 million at current market prices.\nThis move is part of a broader crypto-centric strategy designed to strengthen its balance sheet. Last month, Nano Labs announced a US $500 million convertible notes issuance, structured with zero interest and a 360-day maturity, convertible into Class A shares at US $20 per share.\nThe capital raised will support the company\u2019s ambitious plan to eventually control 5\u201310% of BNB\u2019s total circulating supply.\nNano Labs made a strategic equity investment in CEA Industries Inc., a firm developing BNB reserve infrastructure.\nBNB Price Growth\nThis strategic shift by Nano Labs coincides with BNB\u2019s strong performance in the ongoing market cycle. BNB is currently trading near $843, up by around 50% in the past year.\nThe coin has set multiple record highs this year, most recently touching $899.7 last week, its latest all-time peak.\nIt\u2019s easily one of the best cryptos to buy, as analysts suggest that a potential BNB ETF approval could push BNB to the $1,000 mark.\nRead original story Nano Labs CEO Strengthens Bet With 480K Share Purchase in BNB Strategy Firm by Parth Dubey at Coinspeaker.com"
