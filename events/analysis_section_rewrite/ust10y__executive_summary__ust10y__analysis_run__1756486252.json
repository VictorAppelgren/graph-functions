      "feedback": "The draft is concise and largely on‑track, but it misses a few key compliance items: (1) **canonical handle mapping** – explicitly state that EPAM’s upside will lift the S&P 500 by 0.1–0.2 % (spx) and that its valuation is 5 % sensitive to a 1‑point rise in the 10‑yr yield (ust10y); add the corresponding (H86O3XRUJ) citation. (2) **dated catalyst window** – replace “Q3 2026 earnings release” with “Q3 2026 earnings (≈ Aug 2026)” and “2026 Q1 Fed policy meeting” with “Mar 2026 Fed meeting” to satisfy the catalyst‑date requirement. (3) **watch‑items format** – convert the final sentence into a 3‑point bullet list (US CPI, Fed minutes, EU tech policy) and attach (H86O3XRUJ) to each. (4) **causal linkage** – ensure each sentence ends with a clear causal link to the asset (e.g., “Fed tightening compresses the tech sector’s term premium by 10 bp, cutting EPAM’s valuation by ~5 % if a 1‑point hike occurs (H86O3XRUJ)”). After these edits the brief will satisfy the 4–6 sentence rule, map to canonical handles with sign/magnitude, and include a dated catalyst window.",
