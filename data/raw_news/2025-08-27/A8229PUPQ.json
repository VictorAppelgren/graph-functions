  "title": "Microsoft\u2019s Latest Move Could Upend How You Play With the Best Deal in Gaming",
  "description": "You may need to pay less for cloud gaming, but would you pay more for premium Game Pass?",
  "content": "Xbox Game Pass is marching toward a cliff\u2019s edge. Microsoft\u2019s gaming subscription service has limped along eight years after launch, while the Xbox brand and its lack of new hardware has been castigated by both players and ex-execs alike. The entire format for the subscription\u2014where those paying the most for access to cloud gaming\u2014is going to change. You may end up spending more or less, depending on whether you want all the best features.\n\nThose participating in the Xbox Insiders beta program are now able to play some of Xbox\u2019s cloud games, even if they\u2019re not subscribed to the $20 Ultimate Game Pass tier. In a blog post, the company said players with a \u201cCore\u201d or \u201cStandard\u201d Game Pass sub can access the PC version of titles \u201cincluded with their subscription\u201d over the cloud. The feature runs select games on separate hardware in a cloud server, then Microsoft streams the games\u2019 visuals to your device. The feature was previously exclusive to Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. The Official Xbox Podcast first hinted at this change earlier this month. Microsoft VP Jason Ronald said at the time that opening up cloud gaming would \u201cmake it much more affordable, and make it more accessible to players.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Xbox Game Pass is still the best deal in gaming today. Even after Microsoft made its services more expensive last year, subscribers still have access to a growing list of great games to play. There are two separate subscription tracks for PC or console gamers. For Xbox owners, the base \u201cCore\u201d subscription offers you online multiplayer on Xbox Series X/S and a small catalog of 25 games. The $15-per-month \u201cStandard\u201d tier for consoles supplies a wider swath of games you can download for free. Meanwhile, the $12 monthly \u201cPC\u201d subscription is a better deal overall, as it offers the same suite of games to play plus the ability to download \u201cday one\u201d games\u2014titles on launch date.\n\nGame Pass Ultimate at $20 works across both console and PC. Along with the full Game Pass catalogue and day one titles, Ultimate subscribers previously had exclusive access to the Cloud Gaming service. If Xbox allows cloud games on cheaper tiers, Ultimate will have to change. Xbox Game Pass could balloon in price for gamers who want all the best features. Video game analyst Joost van Druenen suggested in a recent blog post that Xbox may create a cheaper tier or a mobile version as well as a potential $30 subscription for \u201chighly active, premium players.\u201d\n\nXbox is well aware that its console business is\u2014to put it nicely\u2014in a very awkward place. The Head of Xbox Game Studios Craig Duncan told GamesRadar earlier this year that console \u201cgrowth across generations has slowed.\u201d At the same time, most gamers are not just playing on one device. Microsoft recently hiked prices of all Xbox consoles and peripherals and proclaimed it would sell games at an $80 starting price. A Series X with an optical drive now costs $600. Game Pass is still the same price as last year, and as the company pushes its subscription model, it has been simultaneously launching once-exclusive titles like Gears of War: Reloaded on competing platforms like the PlayStation 5 (which experienced its own price hike this month).\n\nDuncan said Xbox wants to reach \u201cas many players as we can\u201d and make it \u201cseamless to buy a game once and have it playable across devices.\u201d Having a staggered Game Pass beholden to consoles and PC separately does not make sense anymore. Microsoft has confirmed it\u2019s working on a next-gen console, but that more powerful gaming device could be one to two years out. In the meantime, it has to rely on third parties like Asus to make branded devices like the upcoming Asus ROG Xbox Ally handheld. If our games are on every system already, breaking down the dichotomy between Xbox and PC gaming is the natural next step.\n\nMicrosoft has stopped relaying the exact number of Game Pass subscribers. At best, we can only guess. A LinkedIn profile of an Xbox worker published online\u2014and subsequently removed\u2014suggested the total number sat around 35 million a few months ago. Video game industry analyst James McWhirter of Omdia previously told IGN that Game Pass subscriptions have slowed in recent years. The firm suggested the total number of subscribers sat around 33.3 million in late 2023. Hitting the fabled 100 million subscriber watermark sounds more like a pipedream with every passing year. Meanwhile, Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now cloud gaming service is planning to offer better bitrates, higher-quality streaming, and the ability to play more of your own games by renting out server space. Xbox also allows players to choose GeForce Now servers for streaming, so long as they subscribe to both. At a certain point, Xbox needs to provide something beyond its current offering if it wants Game Pass to survive instead of die a pointless death.",

      "text": "Xbox is getting serious about Play Anywhere. The initiative has existed in some form for a decade, where a single purchase of a video game carries across to any supported device within the Xbox ecosystem. Despite the clear value proposition, Xbox Play Anywhere has largely been sat in the shadow of Game Pass; more of a curiosity than a centrepiece of the platform. But something has changed.\nSpeaking at the Xbox Showcase, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer declared that \"we're working to make sure you're able to play our games wherever you are, which is why every new game in the show is Xbox Play Anywhere.\" The importance of this is easily overlooked amongst the excitement of an exceptional 2025 lineup of upcoming Xbox games, and the tease of a pivotal 2026 offering which could include new instalments to the platform's most iconic franchises: Fable, Forza, Halo, and Gears.\nBut Spencer's statement is a signal towards the future of Xbox \u2013 more critical to the expansion of the platform than any Xbox Game Studios exclusive or day-one entrant into Game Pass could ever be. The way we play is rapidly changing, and Play Anywhere could be how Xbox regains its competitive edge in a marketplace increasingly dominated by Nintendo, PlayStation, and Valve.\n\"The Xbox business is pretty unique to the industry,\" says Craig Duncan, the head of Xbox Game Studios speaking exclusively with GamesRadar+. \"Xbox is a platform. We publish some of the biggest and most-played multiplatform games; we have Cloud Gaming, Game Pass, and Xbox Play Anywhere. Our plan is to keep making amazing games and have them reach as many players as we can, wherever they want to play.\"\nChanging Dynamics\nTo understand the changing dynamics of Xbox in 2025, you need to accept something: whether you like it or not, it's Microsoft's position that everything is an Xbox now \u2013 including whatever device you're using to read this article. The platform holder believes that the Xbox Store, Game Pass, and Cloud Gaming are its primary portals into the ecosystem, and that Xbox Play Anywhere will act as the bridge between them. \"Recognising that everybody plays in different ways is just so central to what Xbox is trying to achieve \u2013 our vision of how we see gameplay evolving,\" says Roanne Sones, CVP of gaming devices and ecosystem at Xbox.\nThere are now over 1000 supported Xbox Play Anywhere titles. If you purchase any one of these video games from any Xbox online store, you'll be able to take it (and your progress) with you to any supported device \u2013 allowing seamless switching between console, PC, handheld, and cloud. Now if you only exclusively play Xbox games on console or PC, perhaps this feature doesn't appeal to you. But Xbox has anecdotal evidence and hard data to suggest that you may be part of an increasing minority.\n\"We are really investing in refining the experience of playing your games across multiple devices,\" says Jason Beaumont, VP of experiences and platforms at Xbox. \"What I noticed about my console is that it was just one of a constellation of gaming devices that I use in my house. I'm using my console, my gaming PC, my handheld, and Smart TV apps. I play games everywhere, and I want to be able to pick up my progress and continue that wherever I go.\"\nBeaumont is speaking literally here, with Microsoft investing in a collaboration with ASUS to bring the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X to market later this year \u2013 handheld gaming PCs that can play Xbox PC games natively, which is undoubtedly a more attractive way to play Xbox games on the go versus the alternative (entrusting your progression to cloud servers and mobile networks). He's also speaking figuratively, to this belief within Xbox that the state of play is changing.\n\"Our data shows most console players use two or more devices, and that playing the same game on different devices can be difficult. We also know that the console market growth across generations has slowed,\" says Duncan. It's why Play Anywhere is the sort of service Xbox is gambling on. Two questions that the company has struggled to answer in the last 12 months are why console players would invest in Xbox over PlayStation when so many of its first-party titles are going multiplatform, and why PC players would purchase games through the Xbox app on Windows when Steam is right there.\nHere's Duncan's perspective on it: \"When you make pro-consumer decisions, you're going to create a strong business now and into the future. We want our game franchises to be as big as possible, while making Xbox the best place to play these games. And our strategy of reaching as many players as we can, anywhere they are, while making it seamless to buy a game once and have it playable across devices is good for everyone.\"\nPerhaps Play Anywhere is the answer to both questions, then. A single purchase empowered with cross-progression and cross-entitlement. One which then lets you shift from playing online with friends on console, unlocking achievements on PC, and pick up your play on the move through handheld or mobile devices \u2013 your progress, community, and library right there with you. It's a compelling concept, particularly if Spencer's assertion that there's \"28% growth in players playing our games on multiple devices, year over year\" is evidence of changing consumer trends.\nStrong Support\nOne way to look at this is that Xbox is taking proactive steps to meet players where they are. Another is that this shift in strategy is the result of another generation cycle spent in last place \u2013 PlayStation recently announced that it has no plans to change its strategy or platform initiatives. Regardless, it's difficult to begrudge Microsoft for wanting to get ahead of a trend rather than be caught following it. The question, of course, is what incentive developers have for supporting something like Xbox Play Anywhere \u2013 a service that only works if players are aware that it exists, and if more games are willing to support it.\nMarcus Morgan, executive producer of Grounded 2, tells me that the executives leading the Xbox division \"always talk about Xbox in a way of the platform trying to connect to gamers across the globe \u2013 no matter who they are, no matter what they want to play. I think that is such a great and ambitious target.\" That's a sentiment echoed by Brandon Adler, game director of The Outer Worlds 2: \"Anything that encourages more people to play my games I'm always going to love\u2026 It's why something like the Play Anywhere initiative is great, because it invites more people to play.\"\nMuch like Game Pass, it was always going to be down to the first-party developers within the Xbox Game Studios network to really drive something like Play Anywhere into the future (all games developed internally at Xbox will support the service moving forward). But unlike Microsoft's premium subscription service, I get the feeling that Play Anywhere can only truly succeed as a system seller \u2013 a platform incentive that could court players away from PS5 and Steam \u2013 if it receives wide adoption from third-party studios.\nSpeaking with Anil Glendinning, creative director of There Are No Ghosts at the Grand, one of the breakout reveals from the Xbox Showcase, tells me that Play Anywhere support \"felt like a natural fit\" for Friday Sundae's debut game. \"We've always believed that players should be able to pick up where they left off, regardless of the screen in front of them \u2013 it's something that aligns perfectly with the game's structure.\"\n\"One moment you're redecorating haunted rooms in a British seaside hotel on your console, the next you're unravelling supernatural mysteries on your handheld. That flexibility just made sense,\" says Glendinning. \"When considering Play Anywhere, the main questions we asked were: will this improve the experience for players? Can we deliver parity across platforms? And does it support the kind of seamless immersion we're aiming for? In all cases, the answer was yes.\"\nOf the two dozen independent developers and publishers I've spoken with in recent weeks, I'm told that building Play Anywhere support into upcoming projects is relatively simple (as much as anything in the game development process could be considered simple). A three step process which involves joining the ID@Xbox program, implementing cross-progression, and cross-entitlement. Although the general sentiment between this group was that aligning entitlements (which is to say, each device seamlessly registering that a single purchase should be accessible for a player) can be a 'living nightmare' for teams unfamiliar with the process, and that Xbox's support could be stronger here.\n\"We very much view Play Anywhere as an extension of Game Pass and Xbox's commitment to increasing their audience. That will have beneficial implications for developers, but I don't know if it will remove some of the noise from the gaming landscape,\" says Squanch Games CEO Mike Fridley. \"In the long run, if it survives as a service, it will likely increase the noise as more indie and large studios add more and more titles that take advantage of the Play Anywhere feature. In the short run, though, I think it will give studios that are early adopters of the feature the opportunity to stand out. Long story short, the best way to cut through the noise is to make a great game, build a fanbase, and listen to that fanbase. There is no magic bullet to making your game stand out other than quality and availability. Play Anywhere definitely helps increase your availability.\"\nSome developers are taking a proactive approach to ensure its future titles are Play Anywhere ready. Rebellion is one prominent independent studio putting its weight behind the service \u2013 including 2025's Atomfall. \"At Rebellion, we are keen for as many players as possible to enjoy our games, and Xbox Play Anywhere is a great way to help achieve this goal,\" says Ben Fisher, head of design at Rebellion. \"Specifically, we create games using our own in-house engine, Asura, that has support for Xbox Play Anywhere built in. So, it is very straightforward for our teams to ensure that our titles are compatible for Play Anywhere, as well as support Xbox cloud ecosystem and optimise for Game Pass. The Asura engine also scales nicely for PC-based handhelds, which gives us more options beyond streaming and, alongside Xbox Play Anywhere, gives players a wide choice of when and where they can play our games.\"\nSpeaking on background, other flashpoints raised by developers weighing support include recognition that video games are both taking longer and costing more to create. That cross-play and cross-progression initiatives have altered player expectations. That cost of living crises have changed spending habits, particularly as Xbox games are now reaching $80. With Xbox claiming that Play Anywhere increases awareness, grows engagement, and keeps folks playing for longer, can this initiative help developers shoulder the burden of an increasingly volatile market to keep delivering for players?\n\"We strive to create games that we want to play. As fans of gaming and gamers ourselves, whenever we create something that we love or play a game we enjoy, we want as many people as possible to share that fun,\" says Mike Fridley, CEO of Squanch Games, following the reveal of High on Life 2 at the Xbox Showcase. \"Play Anywhere increases the number of gamers that will be able to play our games and partake in that experience.\"\n\"Yes, there are potential financial benefits to increasing your audience, and for some other studios, that may be a major driver for them. To some extent, being able to sell to more customers is a driver for us as well, just not our major reason for doing it,\" says Fridley. \"We are a very small indie studio whose fate is directly tied to our market success. We don't have a big publisher conglomerate that will be able to absorb costs if one of our games doesn't hit the financial mark. Being on as many screens as possible comes with some financial benefits that help us keep our doors open.\"\nThe Future\nMicrosoft Gaming has endured yet another challenging generation cycle. Having spent a decade battling to overcome the perception that Xbox Game Studios isn't delivering new titles, the focus shifted just as the first-party floodgates began to open. There was the public battle to acquire Activision Blizzard, reports of Game Pass missing internal growth targets, and an unsteady venture into multiplatform play. And now, with the incoming release of an Xbox handheld and early talk of next-gen hardware on the horizon, the platform holder is starting to gradually realign its pieces on the board.\n\"We strive to engage with large communities of players around our franchises, and remove barriers so more people can play together and enjoy the games they love, play with their friends, and connect with likeminded gamers,\" says Duncan. \"It's about playing your favorite games on your Series S or X, having cross-save just work, and your progress coming with you. Or finding new games through Game Pass, or playing cross play with some of our games on PC or that have shipped on other platforms. We want our players to enjoy the games we make and play where they want to play.\"\n'Play Anywhere' is becoming more than an initiative to let you seamlessly carry your digital life between devices, then. It's a mantra which bridges Xbox's multiformat ambitions, its increasing first-party output, ongoing support of Game Pass, and new hardware initiatives. As Xbox looks to its future, with early talk of next-gen hardware on the near horizon, Xbox Play Anywhere is transforming into the sell for the entire ecosystem. Whether it will work, only time will tell.\nXbox Special | Our exclusive look at Xbox in 2025 and beyond continues...\nGears of War: Reloaded\nGears of War: Reloaded campaign preview: If playing this classic campaign co-op with one player on a PS5 and the other on an Xbox Series X is wrong, then we don't want to be right. This is shaping up to be the terrific and loving re-release that builds on the success of Gears' 2015 Ultimate Edition.\nGears of War: Reloaded\nGears of War: Reloaded multiplayer preview: Both the best and worst thing we can say about returning to the multiplayer mode that once defined our lives is \u2013 it's still Gears of War. Chunky, uneven, and punishing. It's a tricky proposition in 2025, but we're so glad Gears is back in action.\nNinja Gaiden 4\nNinja Gaiden 4 hands-on preview: It's clear from slicing and dicing waves of enemies that, yes, the joys of the best 3D games in this series are back (and yes, we did manage to beat the boss fight). Talking to the devs, we reflect on the evolution of the action game genre over the last decade.\nNinja Gaiden 4\nNinja Gaiden 4 interview: Team Ninja and PlatinumGames say that \"Soulslikes have kind of taken center stage\" since the last installment to the Ninja Gaiden series, but the devs promise that \"we are going against the trend in that way\" with the upcoming 2025 release of Ninja Gaiden 4.\nGrounded 2\nGrounded 2 hands-on preview: 30 minutes with a survival game like Grounded 2 is just scratching the surface, but we are already hooked. Talking with the devs, they explain why now was the right time to jump into a full, numbered sequel.\nGrounded 2\nIs Grounded 2 an Xbox exclusive? Obsidian won't rule out bringing Grounded 2 to PS5 and other platforms in the future (just as its predecessor did in 2024), but says that this initial release is \"all about being in Game Preview and Early Access\"\nGrounded 2\nGrounded 2 player count: Everything is bigger in Grounded 2, but Obsidian never considered stretching beyond four-players. Speaking to GR+, the studio says doing so \"would have undermined what Grounded was really about.\"\nGrounded 2\nGrounded 2 roadmap: Obsidian is targeting updates every \"four to five months\" after the studio learned the hard way: \"When we started with Grounded 1 in early access we were trying to do monthly updates \u2013 that was a hassle and it didn't work\"\nROG Xbox Ally X\nROG Xbox Ally X hands-on preview: With its first handheld, Xbox's 'Play Anywhere' strategy is coming into sharper focus. And I'm not saying I regret buying a Nintendo Switch 2 at launch... but the ROG Xbox Ally X is almost everything I want from a new Xbox handheld.\nThe Outer Worlds 2\nThe Outer Worlds 2 hands-on preview: This sequel feels like one of our favorite RPG devs (they also made Fallout: New Vegas and Avowed) finally got the resources to make a new sci-fi adventure with the scope they deserve. Full of details, choices, and great action, this is shaping up to be exceptional.\nThe Outer Worlds 2\nThe Outer Worlds 2 exclusive interview: With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian Entertainment is dedicated to making sneaky playstyles truly viable in its upcoming sequel: \"We have a strike team going room-by-room to see if we can stealth properly through each location\"\nThe Outer Worlds 2\nThe rising cost of video games: The Xbox Showcase confirmed that The Outer Worlds 2 will be the first video game out of Xbox Game Studios in 2025 to cost $80. Obsidian Entertainment says we don't set the prices for our games\" and wishes \"everybody could play\" its new RPG.\nJosh West is the Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar+.

      "text": "Your next Xbox device, whether it\u2019s a console, handheld, or some other strange, eldritch device with a glowing green \u201cX\u201d, may be a PC in everything but name. Xbox President Sarah Bond told the world this week that it was working on a sequel to the Xbox Series X console. Hell, there is a whole extended \u201cfamily\u201d of devices bearing the Xbox name currently in the works. The announcement implied more than just new hardware. Microsoft\u2019s whole brand could shift to being more PC-like with a game-themed version of Windows at the helm. If you\u2019re anything like me, getting to play my Steam games on a custom console may be enough to make Xbox seem exciting again. As for Microsoft, the move may be the company\u2019s hail mary to stay relevant in today\u2019s shifting games market.\nThis new selection of hardware will all include processors designed by AMD. That\u2019s not surprising, considering the current Xbox Series X and S have a chip based on the company\u2019s Zen 2 microarchitecture\u2014equivalent to the PlayStation 5. It implies AMD may make a whole family of chips for Xbox devices, but more likely they will be derivative of the company\u2019s current Zen 5 CPUs. AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z2 Extreme is a primary candidate, at least for any device that\u2014in Bond\u2019s words\u2014is \u201calways with you.\u201d\nXbox\u2019s next generation of consoles is going to be a more open environment than it has been before, at least according to Microsoft. We still have yet to see any new Xbox-branded hardware other than the Asus ROG Xbox Ally. Instead, Bond said Microsoft wants a whole \u201cfamily\u201d of Xbox devices that are still compatible with existing Xbox titles. All of them will offer \u201can Xbox experience not locked to a single store or tied to one device.\u201d Wait, what? Does this really imply that we\u2019ll be able to use our Steam library on Xbox?\nSuch a move would be a big shift, but one that seems like the company\u2019s best bet going forward. Microsoft is planning to make the Xbox experience uniform across all the devices bearing the big \u201cX\u201d logo. Microsoft already detailed how the new experience on Windows-based handhelds would be gaming-centric. This new version of Windows 11 dials back a whole slew of background tasks that would normally hinder gaming performance and puts the games front and center\u2014all revolving around the Xbox app. If Microsoft wants to make everything continuous, where your Xbox experience is the same from handheld to console to PC, then everything would need to use Windows and allow for all the major third-party game launchers, from Steam to Epic Games Store to GOG.\nThis is a big change from what users are used to on Xbox Series X and Series S. That custom UI was built upon a legacy of console design dating back to the Xbox 360 \u201cBlades\u201d dashboard. Everything was specifically designed to be operated by a controller. The Xbox app, on the other hand, was first designed for mouse and keyboard, then modified to a small degree for thumbsticks and face buttons. It works, but it\u2019s not the kind of precise interface you should be able to find on a 7- or 8-inch display. Valve had several years to fine-tune its UI, and SteamOS with its horizontal-based layout is easier to navigate.\nMicrosoft spent the last five years relegating its hardware to a secondary status. In the time since the launch of the Series X, the tech giant has focused on building Game Pass up and positioning itself as the Netflix of video games. Microsoft dropped $69.8 billion (you can\u2019t possibly overstate how much money that is) to merge with Activision Blizzard\u2014a strategy that, on paper, seemed to place way too much importance on getting Call of Duty onto its subscription service. Xbox boss Phil Spencer has constantly reiterated the company would focus on getting Game Pass onto other companies\u2019 consoles. Over the last few months, Microsoft allowed several once-exclusive titles onto PlayStation 5, including Forza Horizon 5 and upcoming titles like The Outer Worlds 2.\nXbox can\u2019t rely on software alone. The console maker reportedly hit more than 35 million total subscribers, though data from analyst firm Omdia from 2024 suggested subscription growth has slowed dramatically in recent years. Microsoft hiked Game Pass prices earlier this year, which likely won\u2019t help inspire growth. Beyond updated consoles with more storage, Microsoft didn\u2019t offer a peep about that cylindrical Xbox Series X pro-level device to compete with the PS5 Pro. Whatever comes next, it won\u2019t be pure competition for Sony or Nintendo. It\u2019s going to be a software-first vehicle with the game-centric version of Windows in the driver\u2019s seat."

      "text": "The Asus ROG Xbox Ally is a mouthful of a name for a device, and yet I can\u2019t stop saying the name\u2014like I\u2019m casting a spell\u2014as we slide further toward the end of the year. At Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, Microsoft and Asus are giving players a chance to wrap their mitts around the strange Xbox controller-like grips of the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X. While the companies will tell you when you\u2019ll eventually be able to pick one off a store shelf, they\u2019re not quite ready to tell you how much it\u2019ll cost.\nBoth the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X are slated for release on Oct. 16 in the U.S., Europe, and other markets in Asia. We won\u2019t know how much it will cost and when we can preorder one until sometime \u201cin the coming weeks,\u201d Asus said in a press release. Gamescom attendees will be first to try out the new Xbox-ified version of Windows 11, which should make it easier than Microsoft\u2019s regular ol\u2019 OS to launch games on both the Xbox app and through third-party launchers like Steam and Epic Games Store. The handheld effectively dual boots into the base version of Windows 11 if you need to access all the apps you can\u2019t from the new Xbox menu. Microsoft is also working on a \u201cHandheld Compatibility Program\u201d akin to Valve\u2019s Steam Deck Verified badges. Xbox will label whether a game is \u201chandheld optimized,\u201d which means it works with the default controller layout, or \u201cmostly compatible,\u201d which will require a few adjustments.\nThe ROG Xbox Ally is the lower-end starter handheld compared to the beefier specs of the Xbox Ally X. The one in white comes packed with an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor. Based on specs alone, the chip seems closest in power to a Steam Deck. It\u2019s a 4-core, 8-thread chip based on AMD\u2019s Zen 2 microarchitecture, which the chipmaker launched back in 2019. It\u2019s running on eight RDNA 2 GPU cores, which should be enough for the vast majority of smaller games and a fair few AAA titles on lower graphics settings. It still comes with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of built-in storage.\nThe Xbox Ally X is the one that comes packed with AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z2 Extreme. That APU, or accelerated processing unit, sports 8 cores and 16 threads based on AMD\u2019s latest Zen 5 CPU architecture. The chip is packed with 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores\u2014though not the latest RDNA 4\u2014alongside 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. Just like the Asus ROG Ally X from 2024, it contains an 80Wh battery that should enhance overall playtime, depending on your performance settings. Microsoft also hinted the Xbox Ally X will make use of Microsoft\u2019s Automatic Super Resolution for on-device AI upscaling to enhance performance. Both the Xbox Ally and Ally X contain a 7-inch LCD display. Microsoft said either handheld should receive future updates that will allow for faster launching and better battery life, as well as \u201cenhancements to the docking experience\u201d that suggest the Xbox Ally will work better connected to a monitor or TV.\nThere are a few reasons you should be concerned that neither Microsoft nor Asus wants to drop the bombshell that is pricing. We caught a hint of supposed Xbox Ally prices for European customers back in July. The Xbox Ally was set at 600 euros, or $700, while the Xbox Ally X demanded 900 euros, or $1,050. Those are similar prices to today\u2019s ROG Ally and ROG Ally X in the EU, so these leaks may not be equivalent to what U.S. customers can expect to pay. Tariffs have already caused havoc on PC supply chains and led to manufacturers raising prices. Without any official notice, Asus raised prices on its ROG Ally X from $900 to $1,000 a few months after President Donald Trump announced sweeping global tariffs.\nOptimists will look at the delayed pricing and hope Microsoft is working out a way to subsidize what will be its first new gaming hardware in years, even if it\u2019s simply sporting the Xbox brand name. If the Xbox Ally X is truly as pricey as other handheld PCs, it would make it a premium product that only the most ardent PC gamers would be willing to fork over their funds for. It will need to compete with upcoming handhelds like the Lenovo Legion Go 2 that sports a better OLED display compared to the Ally\u2019s LCD. The Xbox Ally needs to be, at the very least, as cheap as a baseline Steam Deck OLED at $550 or the $600 Lenovo Legion Go S if Asus and Xbox want any chance of staking a claim in the still-nascent handheld scene."

      "text": "Xbox Game Pass remains one of the best deals in gaming, but it is getting worse. This week, Microsoft completely upended its pricing structure for its game subscription service, making everything more expensive and confusing in equal measure. We\u2019ve seen enough apps and streaming services go down this road to know this is a bad sign. Once you start raising prices and restricting common features, you\u2019re already on the path toward enshittification.\nWith just a few emails sent to Game Pass customers, Microsoft generated a wave of confusion surrounding its new price hike. Even with an FAQ, Microsoft struggled to clarify who gets what under their new payment scheme. At the top of the list, Microsoft is doing away with Game Pass for Console entirely for any new members wishing to sign up after July 10. Starting that same date, new Game Pass customers were now required to pay more per subscription.\nU.S.-based customers paying for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will see a $3 increase to $20 a month. It will be $15 more annually if you\u2019ve opted for Game Pass Core. PC Game Pass is going from $10 to $12 a month. There\u2019s a new tier called Xbox Game Pass Standard for $15 a month. But that won\u2019t be available until sometime down the road. That tier is effectively replacing Game Pass for Console.\nAfter Sept. 12, existing members will see the new prices reflected on their monthly bill.\nAre you confused yet? We\u2019re not done. Microsoft is changing the expectations of what you\u2019ll receive depending on your subscription tier. Game Pass Ultimate remains the only tier to allow cloud gaming, but if you opt for the cheaper Game Pass Standard option, you won\u2019t expect any day-one first-party games as the previous Game Pass for Console tier did. So, remember how Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is coming to Game Pass? If you\u2019re new to Game Pass, you\u2019ll need to be paying for PC Game Pass or Ultimate to have it on release.\nIf you still have Game Pass for Console or PC Game Pass, you\u2019ll continue to receive day-one games. Game Pass Core is still the most basic level, mostly there to access online multiplayer, but Standard seems like a pretty lousy deal compared to what you get now. Unless you sign up for Ultimate, you won\u2019t have access to day-one games on either Xbox Series X or Series S.\nThe new tier structure is ludicrous. It expects new and existing customers to parse a whole range of bullet points to understand exactly what they\u2019re paying for. You can\u2019t simply pay for Game Pass, you have to pay for the right version of Game Pass. Netflix may be devolving its tier structure by removing the Basic subscription while forcing users on either Netflix with Ads or Standard, but at least you have access to the same content no matter what. That can no longer be said for Game Pass.\nWhat Does this Mean for Game Pass\u2019 Future?\nAs a reminder for those in the back row, \u201censhittification\u201d is a word coined by tech blogger Cory Doctorow to describe how apps and services screw over users to benefit the company and investors before inevitably turning around and abusing those same investors. The term has gotten a lot of mileage in the past few years. You can see it with some of the most popular social media apps. If you\u2019ve struggled with digital concert tickets or restaurant reservations, you\u2019ve experienced the results of enshittification.\nEnshittification isn\u2019t inevitable, though it is consistent. Microsoft has been pushing Game Pass for a few years now, so much so it has started to look like its hardware has taken a back seat. During its last big games showcase, Microsoft\u2019s big hardware release for the first half of 2024 was a more expensive Xbox Series X with 1 TB storage.\nAccording to The Verge\u2019s Tom Warren quoting anonymous sources, Microsoft is scaling back Xbox sales in Europe. We know the Redmond, Washington tech giant has tried to push Game Pass hard, even hinting it would try to get it on competing consoles. Last week, Amazon and Microsoft declared you could now play cloud gaming titles through a few Fire TV sticks, meaning you don\u2019t necessarily need a smart TV or computer to access the Xbox app and play the wide selection of streaming titles. Xbox head Phil Spencer hit on the central theme with the news, tweeting \u201cNo console? Don\u2019t be scared.\u201d\nBut all that expansion hasn\u2019t seemed enough to claw back some of the $69 billion spent on the Activision Blizzard buyout. The company laid off close to 2,000 staff from its newly-purchased studios earlier this year. There was the promise of seeing Call of Duty come out on Game Pass, but now that will be restricted depending on how much you\u2019re willing to pay Microsoft every month.\nDespite all that, Game Pass is still very, very good. Its cloud service is very smooth, and the title selection is one of the best among game subscription services. Though at $20, it now has to compete with the likes of Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now Ultimate, which has higher stated graphical quality with better bitrates. Game Pass is currently better than Sony\u2019s PlayStation Plus subscription service. PlayStation Plus also increased in price last year, with execs blaming \u201cmarket conditions\u201d for the move. Game Pass Ultimate is $2 more monthly than PlayStation Plus Premium.\nStreaming services have continuously increased fees across the board. What seems inevitable is that Microsoft and Sony will eventually demand players pay even more for their games. But what if it\u2019s worse than that? Game Pass needs loads more subscribers to be a viable replacement for a pure hardware business and recoup losses from the Activision Blizzard deal. If Microsoft can\u2019t make those returns, a worse service seems inevitable. Like streaming, the only outcome is a race to the bottom."

      "text": "Console makers play with pricing\nPlayStation issues price increases as Xbox hints at cheaper Game Pass tiers\nAfter three weeks, I\u2019ve returned from the mountain, armed with field data. With help from the smallest child, we logged the following animal sightings:\n47 deer\n8 bears\n4 turkeys\nseveral spiders\none bat\nThe 5 a.m. indoor sighting of the bat was not well received, as my wife\u2019s reaction confirmed at a record-setting volume.\nOn to this week\u2019s update.\nNEWS\nConsole makers play with pricing\nIt\u2019s a week of opposites.\nSony announced a $50 price increase for PlayStation consoles this week, citing a \u201cchallenging economic environment.\u201d Following the December hike that pushed the PlayStation 5 Pro to $750, the move underscores the ongoing shift of gaming into a luxury category.\nThe news comes just weeks after PlayStation reported record-breaking first-quarter revenue of $6.5 billion, primarily driven by third-party publishing and PlayStation Plus subscriptions. That\u2019s salty, of course. Sony had previously increased the price for its PS5 Pro less than a year ago. The new price hike is entirely man-made. Or rather, Trump-made. The ongoing volatility in the global economy and the rush to implement tariffs has started to materialize.\nBy contrast, Xbox hinted at cheaper Game Pass options.\nIn an interview, Jason Ronald, the VP of Next Generation at Xbox, implied new pricing tiers are coming to the company\u2019s Game Pass service.\n\u2026there\u2019s a lot of players who use Game Pass Ultimate to access the cloud, whether that\u2019s the primary way they play or just an additional way to play when you\u2019re on the go\u2026 it really opens up the opportunity to make it much more affordable and to give more, make it more accessible to more players, whether that\u2019s going into new regions or new ways to actually access the cloud.\nDespite Xbox not having updated its total subscriber numbers for some time, a basic understanding of subscription economics suggests that the service will expand in two directions. The first will be a higher, more expensive tier (e.g., $30 a month) for those highly active, premium players eager to get their hands on Xbox\u2019s AAA catalog on their release dates. The second will be a cheaper tier, or, possibly, even a mobile version.\nMy guess is that the two-pronged approach will help the firm push closer to its 100 million subscriber ambition.\nThe contrast between Microsoft and Sony highlights the diverging strategies of two firms under similar economic pressures. One has been moving away from a model that centers on hardware and is experimenting with price discrimination to expand its subscription base. The other is doubling down on hardware as a premium product. It sets the stage for this year\u2019s holiday season as legacy platforms adjust to the macro-economic impact of tariffs and inflation, offering a glimpse of console gaming\u2019s next iteration.\nChart of the Week\nIt will have been hard to miss the fact that Gamescom, Europe\u2019s biggest gaming event, is taking place this week in Cologne. In his introductory remarks at Opening Night Live, Geoff Keighley said, \"It turns out that E3 didn't die. It just moved right here to Germany.\" Possibly.\nTotal visitor numbers for Gamescom tell a story of its rise as a significant industry gathering, its pandemic disruption, and a cautious rebound.\nLEGO low-key throwing shade at Roblox\nWith its 2023 investment and collab with Fortnite, the Danish brickmaker has been fairly transparent about how it plans to futureproof itself. Digital playspaces are increasingly at the center of its offering, going well beyond the also very successful but more traditional rollout of IP-based film productions, and have convinced LEGO to double down. In its 2024 annual report, LEGO states:\n\u201cGaming is a favourite pastime among kids, and we are exploring new and exciting ways of blending digital and physical play. Since its launch in December 2023, LEGO Fortnite has engaged over 87 million players.\u201d\nIt has since expanded the collaboration with Epic Games and released the first associated physical sets. As part of this effort, it also recently appointed Aaron Leob, a veteran games industry exec (ex-EA, Disney, and Scopely). He heads a new division tasked with creating innovative digital experiences that extend beyond licensing the firm\u2019s IP. In an interview with The Deconstructor of Fun, Leob explains the mandate is \u201cgenerational\u201d because the toymaker wants to stay culturally relevant for the next 50 years.\nIt pairs well with the strategies developed by other toymakers, who, in their own way, are also trying to stay relevant and adapt to how their audiences play today.\nIt leads to two immediate observations.\nFirst, a long-term horizon is a clear competitive advantage. Few companies can invest across decades without provoking shareholder backlash. In this respect, LEGO resembles other behemoths, such as Disney and Nintendo, which have historically resisted investor pressure for short-term gains. The difference, of course, is that LEGO is a privately held company. Publicly traded firms in the interactive entertainment industry must constantly cater to investor demands, often forcing them to make short-term decisions that ultimately constrain long-term growth.\nSecond, existing brands serve as a crucial differentiator in a saturated digital market. Considering the oversupply of content on mobile and PC, for instance, branded games distinguish themselves. For parents, it is short-hand for: \u2018This game is safe for your munchkin to play.\u2019 As much as online games are capable of spawning their own unique intellectual properties and cultural touchstones, existing brands are leveraging their core values to signal quality in these emergent play spaces.\nIt is the tip of the spear for Loeb when developing experiences for kids, and where LEGO throws shade. In the same week that the State of Louisiana filed a lawsuit against Roblox, Loeb underscores LEGO\u2019s differentiator:\n\u201cHow is it going to happen in a way that\u2019s healthy and good? Where it\u2019s actually a great thing kids are interacting with it\u2014because not everyone in the digital space is looking after their safety and wellbeing.\u201d\nOh snap.\n(Like the blocks, see. Get it?)\nLady Gaga hits the Roblox runway\nOver the weekend, Dress to Impress, one of the most popular games on Roblox, hosted a Lady Gaga event. Totaling 33.5 million visits, with a peak concurrent user count of 598,000, the event follows a recent celebrity appearance by Taylor Swift\u2019s football boyfriend on Grow a Garden. The increasing frequency and high user counts indicate that celebrities and musicians are now regularly leveraging Roblox and gaming in general as an established way to reach their audiences.\nAppcharge raises $58M toward distribution innovation\nThe push toward distribution innovation is in full swing. With its latest Series B round, the Israel-based payment firm Appcharge has now raised a total of $89 million from firms like Playrix, Supercell, BITKRAFT, Play Ventures, Smilegate, and others.\nAppcharge provides the infrastructure for publishers to bypass app store fees and sell in-game items directly to players. Its services range from web stores and payment links to real-time segmentation, rolling offers, fraud prevention, tax registration, and merchant-of-record compliance.\nThe new funding round reflects both performance and timing. Appcharge has grown 14 times year-over-year, now processing more than $500 million annually across 100+ games, and delivering publishers an average 35% profit lift. At the same time, recent court rulings against Apple and Google have weakened their dominance in app stores. Following Epic Games\u2019 victory, platform holders must now allow off-platform discounts. I previously calculated the value of this prosperity bomb at $4.1 billion for mobile game makers, with top firms\u2014several of which back Appcharge\u2014best positioned to capture those gains.\nAppcharge\u2019s momentum mirrors efforts by firms like Xsolla, which provide similar direct-to-consumer infrastructure. But its rapid growth and heavyweight investor base suggest it could become a central player in this new ecosystem.\nIt also raises questions for Unity, which, by all accounts, should be in a strong position to offer something similar. Likely, the Appcharge investment is both a short-term play as mobile game makers seek to improve their margins while keeping an eye on a potential acquisition by a larger entity, such as Unity, down the road.\nWhile the investment in a payment company may not register on most people\u2019s radars, it underscores how the balance in interactive entertainment is shifting away from entrenched platforms and back to developers and publishers.\nTry-before-you-buy is back\nSpeaking of distribution innovations, NVIDIA, Discord, and Epic Games are collaborating to demo a new \u201cPlay Instantly\u201d feature that allows you to try games directly within Discord.\nThe service allows players to click a \u201ctry a game\u201d button inside a Discord server, connect their Epic Games account, and immediately jump into a Fortnite session via GeForce Now without any downloads or installs required.\nThe economics look promising. Discord claims that 90 percent of its 200 million monthly active users play games, making it the \u201cdigital living room.\u201d Social play drives higher engagement, and Discord is now leveraging that dynamic to tackle the industry\u2019s perennial problems of discovery and user acquisition.\nThe Verge\u2019s Sean Hollister correctly compares it to the now defunct Gaikai service (acquired by Sony in 2012), which also offered players the ability to try out a title before committing to buying it. Back then, of course, the product-based model was still dominant, and demoing a new title was a key part of getting players to commit fully.\nIf the experiment proves successful, \u201cPlay Instantly\u201d has the potential to reduce friction in discovery significantly.\nEpic scores a win down under\nFollowing a ruling by the Federal Court, stating that Apple had \u201csubstantially lessened competition\u201d by blocking native apps outside its App Store, Epic Games announced that Fortnite and the Epic Games Store will return to iOS in Australia.\nWhile the court rejected claims of unconscionable conduct, the decision marks another crack in Apple and Google\u2019s dominance over the mobile economy, following similar rulings in Japan, Europe, and the U.S. Apple has said it will appeal. Still, for Epic, the verdict represents another step toward lowering the tolls developers pay to reach players. Earlier this week, I joined the BBC\u2019s Global News Podcast to unpack what this ruling means for digital markets\u2014listen here.\nPLAY/PASS\nPlay. The otherwise usually wordy New York Times has launched a new numbers-based game, Pips.\nPass. ZeniMax Media axed more employees in Madison in response to \u201cthe indefinite shelving of a project and other business priority changes.\"\nNEXT UP\nI\u2019m headed to Seattle for GamesBeat Engage to join Krafton, 1UP Ventures, Vivrato, Xsolla, and Accelbyte for some hot takes.

      "text": "Earlier this week, Xbox announced it would start inviting Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to take part in its Xbox Cloud Gaming beta (aka xCloud) on PC and iOS. Like the three other major cloud gaming platforms, Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now, Google Stadia, and Amazon Luna, xCloud also now works in the Chrome, Edge, and Safari browsers, plus on Android and iOS devices. As a beta, there are some limitations, but the important part about Xbox Cloud Gaming is that Xbox is one step closer to competing on the same level as those other platforms in terms of compatible devices and features.\nxCloud for PC doesn\u2019t support keyboards and mice (Xbox is still working on that), so it\u2019s not \u201ctrue\u201d PC gaming yet, but a lot of the available games are easier to play with a controller anyway. There\u2019s also no option to change the resolution or take screenshots with the controller, but again, that\u2019s all stuff that can be added later. xCloud is also not optimized for macOS. You could theoretically run it in the Safari browser since it works in the Safari browser for iOS\u2026but I tried and I couldn\u2019t get any games to load. Not a big deal though, since I don\u2019t play games on a Mac, not even in the cloud, and the beta runs great on PC and the iPhone.\nSo let\u2019s get to the good stuff. I appreciate the simple, straightforward layout of the Xbox Cloud Gaming Beta on my browser. It\u2019s similar to the Game Pass app on Android, but extremely pared down. Just the cloud-based games show, which makes sense because\u2014duh\u2014you\u2019re playing in the cloud. Of course, promoted games show up first, but under that are the games you played recently, and then further down you can see all the games available for Xbox Cloud Gaming in alphabetical order, or you can search by game genre. There\u2019s a little search bar in the top right if you don\u2019t want to scroll through the games.\nOverall, the performance of every game I tried was smooth and stable. I was playing on a wired connection with a 400Mbps download speed, so of course that\u2019s going to give the best performance possible, but even over a 5.0Ghz wifi connection, performance was solid. There were some visual and audio hiccups like pixelation and stuttering (more so with wifi), but nothing that made any game unplayable or frustrating, and latency seems low, too, though I didn\u2019t take any formal measurements. I was able to aim and shoot the Covenant in Halo without any lag or rubber-banding, so that was a major plus.\nOf the games I tried, Banjo-Tooie, Clustertruck, and even The Sims 4 and Forza Horizon 4, all ran without a hitch. I completely forgot I was playing over the cloud. What Remains of Edith Finch, Blair Witch, Halo, and Fallout New Vegas ran great too, but those were the games where I experienced the most noticeable visual and auditory glitches. Sometimes the finer details of my surroundings, like ferns in the Blair Witch forest or purple bell-shaped flowers lining the path to Edith Finch\u2019s house, only sharpened or fully loaded once I got close enough\u2014but again, nothing worth complaining about and nothing some network tweaks on Xbox\u2019s end couldn\u2019t fix. This is a beta, after all, and remarkably polished one.\nI did run into a weird thing with Banjo-Kazooie and Fable 2, though not any of the other Xbox 360 games on xCloud\u2014I couldn\u2019t sign into Xbox Live when prompted. The same problem persisted on iOS, and even on Android through the Xbox Game Pass app. I was previously able to sign into my profile on an Xbox One a few weeks ago and play both of those games, so maybe that has something to do with it. In any case, the verdict is still out on why this is happening, but to be clear it has nothing to do with the performance of Xbox Cloud Gaming on PC and iOS as a whole. This seems like a strange glitch of sorts, and most likely confined to me.\nI wasn\u2019t able to fully try out xCloud on iOS, unfortunately, since I have an older Xbox controller without Bluetooth, and my Razer Kishi isn\u2019t compatible with my iPhone 12, but a good chunk of the games on xCloud are enabled with touch controls, like Celeste and Tell Me Why. I don\u2019t normally like touch controls, but they made those games feel fluid and responsive. They\u2019re also games that don\u2019t require super-super precision, so that\u2019s helpful, too. A game like Tell Me Why is still better played on PC (or a much larger screen in general) though, because the menu text and captions are a tad too small on the iPhone.\nI should note that others haven\u2019t had the same experience as me in terms of maintaining a stable connection. With cloud gaming, a lot of factors come into play that you can control to some extent: your download and upload speed, your router settings, using a wired connection versus wireless, for example. But you can\u2019t control how far away you are from one of Microsoft\u2019s cloud servers, or if your ISP can even handle the amount of data flowing back and forth between your PC and those servers.\nxCloud for Android, PC, and iOS is included with your subscription, plus all the other perks you already get for $15 a month, so it costs current subscribers nothing to play games over the cloud. If you haven\u2019t gotten an invite yet, hopefully you will soon. If you are not already an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, you should consider signing up. I don\u2019t even own an Xbox and I have a subscription because I can play the same games on my PC or phone, and lemme tell ya, this whole playing Xbox games practically anywhere I want without a console sure is nice."

      "text": "Xbox is in a weird place right now, and I\u2019m not the only one who thinks so. In fact, people with more important opinions on the subject than myself seem to agree: if Microsoft doesn\u2019t get its shit together on hardware, the box as we know it is cooked. Laura Fryer, the former director of the Xbox Advanced Technology Group for the original Xbox project back in May 2000 and former executive producer for Microsoft Games Studios up until the Xbox 360 days, put it bluntly in a recent video.\n\u201cObviously, as one of the founding members of the Xbox team, I\u2019m not pleased with where things are today. I don\u2019t love watching all of the value that I helped create slowly get eroded away,\u201d Fryer said in a video on YouTube. \u201cI\u2019m sad because, from my perspective, it looks like Xbox has no desire\u2014or literally can\u2019t\u2014ship hardware anymore. So, this partnership is about a slow exit from the hardware business completely. Personally, I think Xbox hardware is dead.\u201d\nSee Xbox Series S Console at Amazon\nSee Xbox Series X Console at Amazon\nSee Meta Quest Xbox Edition at Best Buy\nThe partnership that Fryer is referring to is, of course, the Xbox and Asus team-up that will see the release of the ROG Xbox Ally handheld that was announced at Computex earlier this month. The criticism from within the games industry and fans is that Microsoft didn\u2019t design the handheld device, instead outsourcing the work to Asus, which modified its existing ROG Ally X handheld PCs, and then slapped Xbox software onto it. Was it laziness on Microsoft and Xbox\u2019s part? Or is it afraid to commit to Xbox hardware?\nOuch. As rough as those words may be, it\u2019s hard not to agree. Out of the gate, Xbox\u2019s current generation of consoles, the Series S and X, were all but trounced by Sony and the PS5, the latter of which snatched a commanding 70 percent of the market share in the first five years of both consoles\u2019 lives. There are a lot of reasons for that, and arguably the biggest is that PlayStation had the exclusive titles that made people actually want to buy a console. But pinning it on game exclusives doesn\u2019t paint the full picture. Part of the problem is that Xbox, for all its past Gamer with a capital \u201cG\u201d glory, got boring. So yes, Xbox is in a weird place right now, but people still want consoles, which means it\u2019s time for them to get even weirder\u2014yes, I\u2019m talking hardware, too.\nFirst, let\u2019s start with the boring box that Xbox houses all of that X in. It sucks. It\u2019s a snooze that makes year-over-year smartphone design feel innovative. Sure, it\u2019s sterile and can mesh with your new-build city-dwelling decor, but it\u2019s also\u2014on the downside\u2014half-assed. If you\u2019re selling people hardware that plays games, they ought to know that it\u2019s a console and not a VCR you forgot to sell in 1997. Say what you will about the PS5 (it\u2019s ugly; that\u2019s the only correct opinion), but Sony took a swing with it. It made sure that everyone who bought one felt like they were buying a console, and like it or not, you eat with your eyes. If you want to give people a reason to buy your console, maybe try giving them a reason. Nintendo did that with the Switch in 2017, and as far as I can tell, that\u2019s going (checks watch) really f*cking well.\nSpeaking of the Switch, Xbox should probably find a way to differentiate its hardware functionality-wise. As dominant as the PS5 has been in the console business, it\u2019s still fundamentally the same machine as the Xbox. That\u2019s a shame, considering Xbox had ample opportunities to bring hardware in exciting new directions over the years. Not to be the Kinect guy, but damn did Microsoft bungle XR big time\u2014and then again, it bungled XR with the HoloLens. In the multiverse, there\u2019s a timeline where Xbox used its experiments with XR via the Kinect and HoloLens to snatch value from the trembling hands of Sony and Meta\u2019s Quest headsets. That is not this timeline, as we all know, but if it really wants to give Xbox a future worth financing, maybe there\u2019s still room to take those more daring expeditions into gaming and refresh them for today\u2019s age.\nThe last thing Xbox needs to do to get weird is a little more nebulous\u2014it needs a new identity. Sure, Game Pass has been a ray of light in an otherwise dim outlook for Xbox, but turning the consoles into subscription machines doesn\u2019t exactly scream, \u201cWe see you gamers, and we hear you.\u201d Xbox can still continue to sell Game Pass subscriptions, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I love Game Pass, and being able to stream games on devices like the Quest 3 feels like a revelation to me. But the emphasis on Xbox being the thing that gets you to the thing makes hardware feel like an afterthought. Gaming on a console that you\u2019ve spent $500 on should feel native; it should feel complete; it should feel like an Xbox, not a PC. That goes back to game exclusives, partly. Sony has had no issues getting weird with its exclusives\u2014Death Stranding, for example, is one of the weirdest games you can play, and now Death Stranding 2 is a PS5 exclusive, which is apparently devastating some gamers. Sucks for them, but it\u2019s kind of a huge win for PlayStation. It\u2019s also more proof that Xbox doesn\u2019t need to be the Netflix of gaming; it needs weird, magnetic titles that make its console feel experiential.\nAs you may have gathered, this would all be kind of a huge shift for Xbox, and it\u2019s debatable whether Microsoft even has the will to make any of it work. I know the last few years have been lackluster for Xbox, but people still want consoles, and the recent success of the Switch 2 all but proves that. Nintendo, for its part, didn\u2019t earn that success the easy way. It took a gamble with the Switch by redefining its hardware, pivoting inward towards games, and ended up releasing the defining console of our generation. That\u2019s all to say, the ball is in your court, Microsoft. Are you going to go out with a bland, forgettable box? Or get weird and, at the very least, go down swinging?\nSee Xbox Series S Console at Amazon"

      "text": "Last week, the Xbox community was sent into a tizzy over rumors that Xbox exclusives Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves might soon be exclusive no more.\nThe rumors remain unproven, but an imminent Xbox Developer Direct has given these reports extra weight. And beneath Xbox console fans\u2019 outcry over the potential loss of more exclusives to other consoles, there is an interesting question rising from the dust of the console war battlefield. For the last console generation, Xbox has been pursuing a markedly different strategy to its competitors: while Nintendo and Sony were busy selling tens of millions of console units on the power of first-party exclusives, Xbox has been trying to build an ecosystem of software that transcends a single box under the TV. Gaming for everyone, Xbox games on every platform where people are playing. Sounds nice, right?\nWith the Activision Blizzard deal now done and Xbox squarely behind both Sony and Nintendo in terms of console sales this generation, all eyes are on Xbox to do something astonishing that will turn the tide in its favor and maybe transform the industry in the process. What will the trick be? Multiple massive blockbuster first-party releases? Finally making cloud gaming something people actually want to do? Releasing Game Pass on Switch?\nOkay, it\u2019s unlikely Xbox has some big 4D chess move prepared this year, and certainly not in time for the Developer Direct. But conversations with a number of industry analysts have convinced me that 2024 is the year we finally start seeing Xbox\u2019s grand ecosystem strategy - and all it entails for exclusivity, multiplatform play, and cloud gaming - finally start to take shape.\nThe Quest for an Xbox Ecosystem\nXbox has publicly been on the \u201cecosystem\u201d train since before the current console generation. Way back in 2018, Spencer said at a Barclays conference that Xbox Game Pass was the future, and that future was going to be on \u201cevery device.\u201d\n\"We use the flywheel that we have with customers on an Xbox to start the growth in Xbox Game Pass. But as somebody sitting back and taking a longer-term view of where our business is going, you should look at that as a business model that we think scales to billions of people not hundreds of millions of people like retail does.\"\nThe following year, Spencer told Kotaku that \"the consoles are not where the profit in this side of the business is made,\u201d and that instead the focus needed to be \u201call about how many games are people playing. And how much people are spending playing those games and how often they play.\"\nBut the conversation isn\u2019t just about Game Pass or subscriptions. Since the release of the Series X and S, Spencer and other Xbox spokespeople have reiterated variations on the theme of meeting players wherever they want to play, including conversations about tech and game releases on other platforms. This mantra perhaps fed rumors in 2019 that Xbox Game Pass was coming to Nintendo Switch. While that ended up being one step too far, Xbox did bring previously-exclusive games Cuphead and Ori and the Blind Forest to Nintendo\u2019s platform later that year -- an unprecedented move for a company selling its own gaming box.\nXbox has tried to temper fears that it\u2019s not focused on growing its own console, especially amid ongoing criticisms this generation that it doesn\u2019t have enough first-party exclusive hits. In 2020, Spencer made an effort to reconcile his gaming philosophy with the fact that any Switch or PlayStation rendition of GamePass would inevitably come with caveats: \"The other competitive platforms really aren't interested in having a full Xbox experience on their hardware. But for us, we want to be where gamers want to be and that's the path that we're on.\"\nLast summer, he and other Xbox leaders asserted that console was \u201ccritical\u201d to the future of Xbox. And then, at the end of last year, Xbox CFO Tim Stuart appeared to reiterate the GamePass everywhere strategy, only for Spencer to seemingly rebuke it not long after.\nOn a surface level, this series of public comments, official decisions, and rumors can make it a bit tricky to tell how serious Xbox is about the whole \u201cecosystem\u201d thing. But Circana analyst Mat Piscatella frames the last five years of news headlines differently when I ask him his thoughts on it, noting that Xbox has actually been \u201cpretty consistent\u201d on what\u2019s actually come to market, and that the mish-mash of strategy conversations we\u2019ve seen over the last generation is more emblematic of a company in transition, with all the challenges that come with it.\n\u201cThey haven't gone all-in on the strategy, at least not yet,\u201d he says. \u201cBringing games and services to other platforms in order to drive dollars on the content and services side would surely help, but there's also the hardware business to support, so I'm sure there's quite a bit of push and pull happening. And parts of the established base want to cling to the old hardware installed base driven model, and have been quite vocal about it.\n\u201cIt's a tough place. They're trying to expand the audience and drive new ways of playing, but also don't want to leave the audience that's been with them from the start behind. It's a difficult thing to do, with many interests and inputs to balance.\u201d\nXbox\u2019s current strategy is born out of necessity\nIt\u2019s no wonder Xbox is running into obstacles \u2013 what it\u2019s suggesting is a pretty dramatic overhaul of the existing model for how games, consoles, and exclusivity have worked for years. As NYU Stern School of Business professor and author of SuperJoost Playlist Joost van Dreunen puts it, \u201cXbox has redrawn the games industry landscape. Where historically the market was made-up of insular walled gardens, Xbox\u2019 current strategy proposes a device-agnostic, cross-platform roadmap.\u201d\nAmpere Analysis\u2019 Piers Harding-Rolls notes that it\u2019s also uniquely positioned to suggest an ecosystem strategy thanks to its \u201chistory in the PC gaming space, its key role with Windows and its long list of B2B services targeting the games sector, including Azure and developer tools,\u201d But he acknowledges too that Xbox\u2019s move seems to have been born, at least in part, out of necessity, as Xbox has fallen behind in the so-called \u201cconsole wars\u201d since the heyday of the Xbox 360.\nThe Series X and S have not helped it gain much ground. Omdia\u2019s console forecast suggests that Xbox Series X and S hardware sales dropped by 12.7% year over year in 2023, despite it being at phase in its lifecycle that would traditionally be considered a \u201cgrowth phase\u201d and releasing what should have been a blockbuster exclusive in Starfield.\n\u201cTo make matters worse, we\u2019re expecting the seven-year-old Switch to have outsold Xbox Series X/S by almost a factor of two in 2023,\u201d says Omdia senior games analyst James McWhirter.\nMultiple analysts I spoke to pointed out to me that while some might have expected Xbox to rectify this situation somewhat with its recent acquisition of Activision-Blizzard, its pledge to keep major games multiplatform for at least a decade means it won\u2019t be able to capitalize on them as exclusives to bolster those console sales anytime soon. Meanwhile, Xbox\u2019s whole \u201cecosystem\u201d situation isn\u2019t exactly rocketing them to the moon either.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing slowing adoption of Xbox Game Pass even though Microsoft will claim otherwise thanks to the repositioning of Xbox Live Gold as Xbox Game Pass Core,\u201d McWhirter says. \u201cOur forecast estimates total Xbox Game Pass subscriptions (excluding Core/Live Gold) to be at 33.3 million at the end of 2023, which represents subscriber growth of just 13% - down from 15% in 2022. Notably, over half (55%) are currently on the device-agnostic Ultimate tier.\u201d\nPiscatella notes too on X/Twitter that subscription services specifically aren\u2019t growing as fast as they used to. Xbox\u2019s kingdom cannot be built on subscription alone (especially if key developers aren\u2019t sold on its value), nor can it be built overnight. Phil Spencer wasn\u2019t lying last summer when he said that consoles remained \u201ccritical\u201d to the success of Xbox, but here\u2019s a new reading of that statement for you: consoles seem to be \u201ccritical\u201d to sustain the business while Xbox metamorphosizes. That\u2019s why Spencer is, quietly, still advocating for the big exclusives the Xbox console audience keeps demanding, even as Microsoft president Satya Nadella seems far less interested in the idea. Even if it\u2019s third place in the console market, Xbox needs that bronze medal as a lifeline while it makes inroads into new sectors where it hopes to win gold, such as cloud gaming and this supposed bold new software ecosystem of cloud, subscriptions, exclusives, and mobile games it keeps alluding to.\n2024: The Year of the Ecosystem?\nSo when will we see Xbox finally emerge and make good on its promises of gaming for everyone, everywhere? Will the Developer Direct this week herald a bold new era? Is 2024 the year of Xbox at last?\nWell\u2026 probably not. These things take time. But that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t expect to see more inroads built this year. Most analysts I spoke to agreed that while Xbox\u2019s 2024 first-party portfolio will likely be stronger than that of previous years, it isn\u2019t going to rocket the console to the top of the sales charts.\nFor one, 2024 will almost certainly offer clarity on Xbox\u2019s strategy for Activision Blizzard games, especially with regard to which ones are coming to Game Pass and when, what it plans to do with PC-exclusive World of Warcraft and back catalog games like Starcraft, and what Xbox owning Call of Duty will really mean for how those games are sold, accessed, and played. The acquisition\u2019s ripples on Activision Blizzard development itself won\u2019t be felt for a few more years, but the ecosystem strategy will begin almost immediately.\nWhich brings us back to all those rumors of Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves coming to Switch or PlayStation. McWhirter says that, despite what naysayers online might suggest, Xbox bringing these current-exclusives to its competitors actually benefits Xbox more than Nintendo or PlayStation. \u201cThere are signs that Hi-Fi Rush underperformed relative to Microsoft\u2019s expectations in terms of its impact on Game Pass subscriptions growth and engagement and full game downloads. Releasing a late port to, say, the Switch, makes continued development of titles like it more sustainable while securing timed exclusivity on Xbox while adding value to Game Pass.\n\u201cSea of Thieves has already been on the market for six years and continues to be one of Microsoft\u2019s most successful live service titles after Minecraft, with higher peak and average MAUs compared with Halo Infinite. Putting it on other platforms should help it reach new highs and its age and pre-existence on PC suggests it has long outlived its usefulness in selling Xbox consoles.\u201d\nThe analysts I spoke to agree that a strategy of curated, timed releases of former-exclusives on Nintendo and PlayStation consoles makes a lot of sense for Xbox, and further bolsters its own philosophy of putting its games wherever players happen to be. And no, vocally pro-exclusive audiences on social media likely won\u2019t deter them if there\u2019s a significant advantage to be had, especially if that audience has already enjoyed a period of exclusivity.\nBut Game Pass on Switch or PlayStation, analysts say, would be a bridge too far. Rather, both van Dreunen and McWhirter expect Xbox to launch a mobile Game Pass service \u2013 McWhirter says it could happen as soon as this year \u2013 especially in the wake of the Activision-Blizzard deal:\n\u201cBecause gaming is increasingly online and based on multiplayer gameplay, I expect platform holders to broker deals that would allow greater circulation of content between devices and ecosystems,\u201d van Dreunen says. \u201cMy expectation is that Xbox will try to launch a mobile Game Pass service to reach billions of mobile gamers and deliver on its ambition to reach 100 million subscribers for its Game Pass service. Before ABK/MSFT it had little access to this audience. Even so, there will be specific differentiators between platforms like exclusives, pricing plans, and bundles. But it seems idiotic that I cannot play the same online game on every device in the same way that I can call anyone regardless of what telecom provider they use.\u201d\nThe Xbox Series X and S might be at a \u201cgrowth\u201d phase in their life cycles, and 2024 might herald something that looks like growth if even a handful of Xbox\u2019s 23 game development studios are ready to smash exclusives out of the park. But the real growth Xbox seems to be banking on remains its gaming ecosystem, centered around Game Pass and xCloud, reaching as many devices as possible. Xbox is dreaming of a future in which the \u201cXbox audience\u201d isn\u2019t just the people who own Xbox consoles, but contains Switch owners, PlayStation owners, mobile gamers, and more \u2014 all of them playing Xbox games. In the coming year and beyond, we can be on the lookout for mobile Game Pass, Game Pass on smart TVs, a curated selection of former Xbox exclusive games on rival consoles, and several more strands spun into the encompassing gaming web that Xbox has been steadily crafting for nearly a decade now.\nIt remains to be seen whether or not that ecosystem will, or can succeed, and whether or not that success depends on exclusives. We won\u2019t find out in 2024, but if we\u2019re all playing the latest Halo on a smart fridge in 2040, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have something spicy to say on social media about it.\nRebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

      "text": "Welcome to the era of $80 games. Xbox is the first major game publisher after Nintendo to promise a sweeping price increase for its entire portfolio, save for Game Pass. Consoles, controllers, and other accessories will cost more, but the real cherry on top is the promise that some of the company\u2019s first-party games will start at $80 later this year. It sounds like the sort of thing that would hurt sales, but all it really means is Xbox will push Game Pass even harder than before.\nIn a note published to the Xbox support site, Microsoft detailed a new pricing structure it\u2019s recommending to retailers. Starting Thursday, May 1, all Xbox consoles will see price increases. The Xbox Series S with 512GB of storage increases from $300 to $380, and a 1TB version jumps from $350 to $430. An Xbox Series X Digital console now costs $550 compared to its previous $450, and the model with an optical drive now costs $600, $100 more than its previous $500 MSRP. An Xbox Series X Galaxy Black Special Edition with a 2TB SSD now runs $730, or $120 more than its previous $600 price tag, and even more than a $700 PlayStation 5 Pro.\nThe Xbox Wireless Controller, which remains a staple for both console and PC gaming, now costs $65. The Xbox Elite Series 2 controller now starts at $150, up from $145. The official Xbox Wireless Headset will set you back $120, $10 more than before. Microsoft\u2019s gaming hardware will see price hikes outside the U.S. as well.\nFirst-party Xbox games will hit the $80 price point \u201cthis holiday season,\u201d according to Xbox. Microsoft\u2019s gaming brand is the first to jack up prices since Nintendo introduced its $70, $80, and $90 pricing structure for first-party Switch 2 titles. It\u2019s only a matter of time before other major publishers take the hint and raise their prices as well.\n\u201cWe understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development,\u201d the company wrote on its support page. Gizmodo reached out to Xbox for comment on whether this had anything to do with Trump\u2019s tariffs, but we did not immediately hear back.\nAs much as Xbox wants to point the finger at market conditions, the game price gouging has been a long time coming. Major publishers have been gnashing their teeth for years over how game prices have not increased with inflation. For instance, Halo: Combat Evolved retailed for $50 back in 2001, equivalent to $91 in today\u2019s dollars when adjusted for inflation. However, publishers have been looking hard at Nintendo and its Switch 2 pricing. The Japanese console maker is promoting digital editions of Donkey Kong Bananza at $70 and Mario Kart World at $80. The Switch 2 is already sold out in most shops that are doing preorders, which is likely indicating to the industry that players are willing to bite the bullet on more expensive games.\nXbox Game Pass remains the only service that\u2019s not going up in price. Last year, Microsoft changed up its gaming subscription service, increased the cost of most tiers, and nixed access to day-one games from its lower-priced console tier. With more expensive games on the horizon, Game Pass may look like an even better deal than before, but Microsoft can always change its policies in the future.\nIf it isn\u2019t clear already, Microsoft\u2019s Game Pass will be its bread and butter going forward. Xbox is no longer interested in using hardware to push exclusive titles. This month, it brought once-exclusive games like Forza Horizon 5 to PlayStation 5. Xbox head Phil Spencer recently said he would put Game Pass on Nintendo and Sony platforms if he\u2019s given the opportunity.\nBased on Microsoft\u2019s Q3 earnings report released this week, Xbox hardware sales were already down compared to the rest of its portfolio. Meanwhile, revenue from Xbox \u201cservices,\u201d namely Game Pass, was up by 8% year-over-year. Microsoft now sees Xbox as a service model, and hardware will inevitably fall by the wayside. Rather than make a handheld itself, Microsoft will partner with hardware experts like Asus on an Xbox handheld. Higher prices on all hardware and games, even those from other publishers and console makers, will inevitably push more people to Game Pass. In that way, the entire games industry is feeding into Microsoft\u2019s hands."

      "text": "What if game streaming was your main way to play your games? That idea\u2014once merely a pipedream\u2014is inching closer to reality with Nvidia\u2019s latest update to GeForce Now. Come September, players will be able to rent out a server worth 100GB or more to play whatever game they want, so long as they already own it. Even with more games and better streaming visuals, streaming can\u2019t replace all your gaming gear. But if you were feeling antsy about how much that new PC upgrade or future console could cost, a $20-per-month sub may seem like a bargain in comparison.\nThis \u201cInstall to Play\u201d feature will be available to all paying members of GeForce Now sometime next month. A publisher needs to \u201copt in\u201d to let their game be streamed remotely, so you may need to wait for your entire Steam library to be available. When the service is up and running, any compatible games can then be downloaded to a remote PC and played during a single session. But say you want to continue your game without needing to redownload it? Nvidia said it will allow users to effectively rent out 200GB of persistent cloud storage starting at $3 extra per month. More download space will cost more.\nMicrosoft has made similar moves recently with Xbox Game Pass service. Subscribers can stream some select PC and console games they already own on the Xbox PC app. Compared to that, Nvidia\u2019s Install to Play could make a massive windfall of titles available to stream from any place with a good-enough internet connection.\nThere are other streaming services like Shadow PC, which allow you to effectively rent out a remote PC and operate it like your own, but those can cost between $38 and $50 per month. If the streaming quality holds up, Nvidia\u2019s Install to Play, plus the already sizable library of games available to stream, could effectively max out your PC games library. GeForce Now already has apps on PC, Mac, and mobile, along with a dedicated application on Steam Deck. Nvidia also plans to release a specific app for the Legion Go S handheld with SteamOS. This version will allow you to play at 4K and 120 fps connected to a TV via HDMI.\nThere are several major changes coming for those who subscribe to the GeForce Now Ultimate subscription. Everybody spending $20 a month will be able to access 4K resolution at 120 fps on LG TVs and RTX 5080-level graphics capabilities through the cloud, a jump up from the previous RTX 4080. The new GPU will be hosted on Nvidia\u2019s servers at no additional cost to users. Finally, users will be able to play games at 5K resolutions. That will mean additional widescreen support for massive curved monitors like LG\u2019s 5K2K UltraGear monitors.\nThe big benefit now for paying the $20 subscription is access to \u201cCinematic\u201d quality streaming mode. Essentially, the mode promises even better visuals than what you normally get with streaming. For those enjoying 100 Mbps download speeds, in-game trees will no longer look like a pixelated collage of stems and leaves. Streaming has the tendency to wash out colors and make details less distinct. Nvidia claims Cinematic quality mode will even make in-game HUDs and menus more legible. The mode could result in more accurate colors for games that support HDR, or high dynamic range, for better contrast between darks and lights. SDR content will still look better, but to a lesser degree.\nHow much better performance you will get from various titles will depend on the game. In our tests of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 GPU, we saw the card could get around 8% better frame rates on average compared to the RTX 4080 Super. Nvidia has a bad habit of showing off multi-frame gen capabilities on its GPUs and comparing the improvements to older graphics cards. Multi-frame gen is a technique where the GPU can insert multiple generated frames in between two rendered frames, increasing the overall responsiveness of a game. Older GPUs like the RTX 4080 could only do 2x frame gen, while the 50-series can handle up to 4x. Yes, a GPU doing twice as much frame gen will result in higher frame counts, if that\u2019s the only thing you care about.\nThere are drawbacks to frame generation. The technology can introduce small visual glitches that aren\u2019t there when the game is rendered fully natively. Frame generation also introduces latency between what you\u2019re seeing on screen and what\u2019s rendered by the graphics processing pipeline. Latency can be a real killer for game streaming, but Nvidia told Gizmodo it upgraded the CPU and memory in its SuperPOD servers with new technology, which will offset frame gen latency.\nNvidia also changed its formula for data packets, the unit of data formatted for telecommunication networks, to \u201cintelligently,\u201d which will result in fewer dropped packets. The company is working with major telecom companies like CableLabs and Comcast, as well as T-Mobile and its L4S network, for this new data technique.\nLook, Nvidia isn\u2019t going to go to communities and set up quality internet. GeForce Now still can\u2019t completely replace a console or PC, not when the service is so dependent on your home internet speeds. Late last year, Nvidia added support for 1440p streaming and the ability to save graphics settings between games. The rub was the new limitation of 100 hours of playtime each month. The company has yet to raise streaming prices, but when every major streaming service\u2019s prices are ballooning every year, you shouldn\u2019t expect to keep shelling out the same amount for much longer."

      "text": "After Xbox and Nintendo both made their consoles and peripherals more expensive, it was inevitable that Sony would make the same move. Now every version of the PlayStation 5 costs $50 more, no matter if you decide to opt for the all-digital version or the PlayStation 5 Pro. No matter whether you\u2019re an Xbox, PlayStation, or Nintendo diehard, all your consoles will cost you way more, all down to the economic shitstorm caused by Trump tariffs.\nIn a blog post, Sony said it was navigating \u201ca challenging economic environment,\u201d which is common code for steering the ship around supply chain and manufacturing issues caused by Trump\u2019s obsession with import taxes. Starting Thursday, Aug. 21, the PlayStation 5 with disc drive will cost $550. Sony hiked the PlayStation 5 digital edition to $500, the same price as the previous version that could play physical media. Finally, the most expensive console, the PS5 Pro, will demand a whopping $750 from your wallet. All the PS5 accessories are keeping their current prices, but that means if you want a PS5 Pro with a separate $80 disc drive, you\u2019ll end up spending $830 just to play all your PS4 and PS5 game discs with better graphics and performance options.\nBefore the hike gets into gear, you still have the option to grab a cheaper version. Deals hunter Wario 64 pointed out that the PS5 Slim model Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 bundle still costs $400. Along with the $80 optical drive, it could be the cheapest way to get the stock standard PS5 before tomorrow\u2019s price hikes.\nPS5 Disc Drive is still priced at $79. This Digital bundle + disc drive separate is currently the cheapest way to get a PS5 and a disc drive before price increase happen https://t.co/ZsgZRXNft4\n\u2014 Wario64 (@Wario64) August 20, 2025\nMicrosoft hiked its digital Xbox Series X console prices up to $550 back in May in response to ongoing Trump tariffs. The Series S went up to $380 from $300. If you want a Series X with the optical drive, you need to pull out $600 from your wallet. Microsoft similarly made its controllers and official headset more expensive as well. While Nintendo kept its Switch 2 price steady at $450, earlier this month, the Mario maker increased prices for its original $300 Switch consoles by $40. The Switch Lite is now priced at $230, but the major blow was news that the Switch OLED now demands $400, just $50 less than the Switch 2. Nintendo also hiked prices of its Switch 2 controllers and other accessories by around $5 after already boosting costs back in April."

      "text": "Gears of War: Reloaded releasing on the PlayStation 5 is an irony baked into an irony. The remaster of the Xbox 360 classic\u2014once the title that helped distinguish it from rival Sony\u2019s PlayStation 3\u2014is a better game on the PS5. Hell, the best way to play for high frame rates at 4K resolution\u2014outside of PC\u2014is on PlayStation 5 Pro. There\u2019s no contest. Even with upgraded graphics, frame rates, and all the extra content that has come out since 2006, the only people who will truly enjoy Gears of War: Reloaded are those who want to return to a time when cover shooters reigned supreme.\nTo make the scenario all the more like a turducken, Reloaded is a remaster of a remaster. Developers The Coalition first brought back Gears of War with the Ultimate Edition in 2014 after Microsoft bought the rights for the series from the original creators, Epic Games, and handed the franchise over to Xbox Game Studios. The re-rerelease upgrades the graphics to support 4K resolutions and up to 60 fps in the campaign. Plus, you can now expect up to 120 fps in multiplayer. The game looks crisp and clean in a way the Xbox 360 or Xbox One versions couldn\u2019t; Reloaded includes improved textures to make all the gray rubble and all the dark caves look even more grainy than 20 years ago. The game is beautiful in parts and closer to the original in graphical tone than the 11-year-old Ultimate Edition, but it only reminds me of a time when studios thought gamers wanted their games gritty, even when it makes most environments blend into each other.\nGears of War: Reloaded on PS5\nGears of PS5 the best way to enjoy the 20-year-old game. If only the game was worth replaying\nPros\n- Excellent visuals\n- Strong performance on PS5 Pro\nCons\n- Limited visual options\n- First game isn't as good as its sequels\nXbox Game Studios and The Coalition added even more functionality specific to the PS5 version, stuff you can\u2019t possibly get on Xbox. For one, the game supports the Adaptive Triggers on the PS5\u2019s DualSense controller, making each gunshot feel like you\u2019re fighting against the kick of the prototypical \u201cLancer\u201d machine gun. The DualSense has built-in speakers that rarely get used by third-party developers. The Coalition added sounds so characters speaking on the radio will come through the controller. And when you rev the Lancer\u2019s famed chainsaw bayonet, you\u2019ll hear the whine through the DualSense\u2019s thin speakers. This doesn\u2019t add much to the experience other than to annoy any friend sitting down for split-screen co-op. It\u2019s a big reason why I kept the setting enabled for close to the seven hours it took to finish the campaign. The chainsaw noise kept me going when the 20-year-old gameplay and dry, human meat sticks of characters failed to entice me. I just hope the eventual Netflix movie doesn\u2019t go full meathead mode, like the original game did.\nGears of War: Reloaded plays and runs better on PS5 Pro\nThanks to the enhanced GPU capabilities and extra AI upscaling, the Gears of War: Reloaded on the PlayStation 5 Pro is the best way to max out the game on consoles. The game makes use of the system-exclusive PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution. This variety of AI upscaling takes the game at a lower resolution and upscales it to a higher resolution ,while keeping the performance gain. Reloaded doesn\u2019t have any preset graphics options such as \u201cQuality\u201d or \u201cPerformance.\u201d Instead, you have the option to set 120Hz mode to \u201cAuto.\u201d With that enabled, I was able to play the game at the fabled 120 fps in 4K through most indoor environments. Once the action went outside, the frame rate could dip into the 90 fps or even high 80 fps, especially when watching the light show while firing the \u201cHammer of Dawn\u201d orbital satellite laser.\nSee Gears of War: Reloaded at Amazon\nGears of War: Reloaded uses AMD\u2019s older FidelityFX Super Resolution on the regular PS5 and Xbox Series X for its upscaling. On the PS5 Pro, I didn\u2019t notice any explicit graphical glitches or artifacts caused by the AI resolution booster. Even with the lack of graphical options, this is a good port of an 11-year-old remaster of a 20-year-old game. If only the first Gears of War was truly worth slogging through that original campaign for the second or perhaps third time.\nWe\u2019re in a strange time for gaming. Xbox has seemingly relented on the entire concept of game exclusivity. Already, former PC- and Xbox-only titles like Forza Horizon 5 have come to the PS5 and quickly become the system\u2019s top sellers. The only legacy of Microsoft\u2019s gaming arm you\u2019ll find in-game is when Xbox demands you sign into a Microsoft account after you first launch the title.\nActually playing the Reloaded is less of a nostalgic thrill ride. Gears of War practically invented the idea of the cover shooter. You press a button, and gruff, tough, and always-grunting Marcus Fenix magnetizes to the nearest wall. The game wants players to stick to cover as much as possible, popping off shots from the comfortable safety of your chest-high wall. In combat, you\u2019ll often dive around out of cover to take care of skulking, pint-sized \u201cRetches\u201d or perform a sort of jig whenever the enemy AI decides to vault over a wall right next to you.\nThe visual upgrade on PS5 belies the fact that Gears of War was never that incredible a game. I grew up an Xbox 360 diehard. My 12-year-old brain couldn\u2019t recognize how every dull gray hallway, stacked with enough chest-high walls to take cover behind, was just a funnel for the game to shove more muscle-bound, snarling Locusts for you to shoot. Neither Fenix nor his compatriots share much about their background, their ambitions, their worries, or anything to make you care about them or even humanity\u2019s plight.\nEverything is meat. The characters\u2014the titular \u201cGears\u201d\u2014have legs like ham hocks and necks so thick they attach to their heads like unpopped pimples. Bodies split apart into thick chunks of rare steak when buzzed through with a chainsaw or the near-uncountable machine gun turret sections. To a pubescent me, the combat was satisfying and visceral. Twenty years later, playing the original Gears of War is like trudging through a mire. Enemies are bullet sponges that soak ammo until they fall to the ground like they\u2019re performing a pratfall on a stage. The quickest way to breeze through combat is with high-damage weapons, such as the \u201cLongshot\u201d sniper rifle or \u201cBoomshot\u201d rocket launcher. The \u201cTorque\u201d bow, a crossbow with an explosive bolt, is still the most satisfying weapon in the game. Everything else feels there and done by comparison.\nImagine if we got Gears of War 2 on PS5, too\nGears of War: Reloaded would have been a much bigger deal if it had included remasters of the original game\u2019s immediate sequels. Imagine if suddenly you could play the original Uncharted: Drake\u2019s Fortune on Xbox Series X. Would it make nearly as big an impression as Gears on PS5? Most fans of the series remember the games for what Naughty Dog accomplished in Uncharted 2 through 4. Compared to later entries, the original game was a slog through messy gunplay and odd level design. In the same way, Gears of War found its stride with Gears of War 2. Not only did the sequel have more level variety and a longer campaign, but it also helped us feel an ounce of empathy for the characters. It also offered us such memorable lines as \u201cThey\u2019re sinking cities with a giant worm.\u201d\nThe only players who should want to play Gears of War: Reloaded are those nostalgic for the Xbox 360 days, or else they think they\u2019d like to spend a few sit-down sessions in a time capsule. The in-game voice lines gave me flashbacks to the time my brother and I spent hours trying to beat the game on its hardest difficulty, where every death sent us back to the last checkpoint to hear the same inane lines over and over again.\nGears of War: Reloaded on PS5 is less a story about a game and more about what it represents. At the time of the Xbox 360, Halo and Gears of War were Microsoft\u2019s two largest IPs that it jealously guarded. Should Reloaded represent the true end of the console wars? There were sure signs that was already the case. Xbox has shown its intent to publish its games on both Nintendo and Sony platforms, but what about the opposite? In the company\u2019s last earnings report published earlier this month, Sony VP Sadahiko Hayakawa told investors the company was \u201cmoving away from a hardware-centric business to more of a community-based engagement business.\u201d A recent job posting shared online suggested the company wished to publish more first-party titles on Steam and even Xbox. But PlayStation may not go \u201cfull Xbox\u201d and center its business model on a subscription like Xbox Game Pass.\n\u201cI doubt they\u2019ll deprioritize hardware as such,\u201d Karl Kontus, the general manager of Video Game Insights at analyst firm Sensor Tower, told Gizmodo. \u201cTheir aim is to just build out other revenue sources on top of that, such as the PS+ subscription, live services, and cross-platform with PC and maybe handhelds. I really don\u2019t think this means PS+ will start looking more like Game Pass.\u201d\nXbox may continue to be in a league of its own. If it continues on this path, the inevitable next step is to put the next Halo on PlayStation. At this point, anything can happen."

      "text": "Let\u2019s forget about the mudslinging that occurs when anyone brings up the two big console makers who don\u2019t have a big \u201cN\u201d in their name. Instead, let\u2019s ask a simple question: what do we actually want from a next-gen Xbox or PlayStation? The latest rumors suggest 2026 could be a big year for Microsoft and Sony, as both may pump out new consoles with PC-level graphics capabilities and handheld gaming platforms to compete with the Steam Deck and Switch 2. The only caveat that\u2019s going to deflate our rising enthusiasm is the inevitable sticker shock of significantly more powerful consoles.\nFirst, let\u2019s look at what we know, what we don\u2019t know, and what\u2019s churned out from the ever-grinding rumor mill. Sony has yet to provide a hint of a next-gen PlayStation device, though Microsoft has effectively confirmed there\u2019s a new Xbox console coming. Sony won\u2019t be far behind. Reliable rumors from sites like Windows Central have mentioned that Microsoft was working on its own Steam Deck-like handheld device, but that\u2019s been pushed to 2026. In the meantime, our first taste of Xbox-branded hardware will come with the aid of Asus in the form of the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X. Sony\u2019s only official nod to handhelds was it adding game streaming to its perfunctory PlayStation Portal.\nXbox may be rushing out a whole new console for 2026, according to normally reliable leaker \u201cMoore\u2019s Law is Dead\u201d on YouTube. The new console is reportedly codenamed \u201cMagnus,\u201d and it will use AMD\u2019s latest Zen 6 CPU microarchitecture alongside new RDNA 5 graphics capabilities. Without actual specs, we can\u2019t say just how good it will be, but \u201cMoore\u2019s Law is Dead\u201d suggested Xbox is aiming for twice the graphics performance of the PlayStation 5 Pro. It could have ray tracing capabilities, which offer more realistic lighting in games, and a stated graphics performance of up to 120 fps at 4K resolution.\nThe leaker mentioned the next-gen Xbox GPU could have 68 compute units, the core clusters that normally define how capable an AMD processor is. With supposed specs stating the chip will be a 3nm processor with a 192-bit GDDR7 memory bus, it could be a fast and efficient chip for console gaming. \u201cMoore\u2019s Law is Dead\u201d mentioned it could offer performance on par with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080, but we seriously doubt users can expect performance equal to a PC with those stated specs. What will give it a serious leg up is AMD\u2019s FSR 4 upscaling. Compared to earlier versions of AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution, the latest version is a proprietary technology for AMD chips that takes a frame at a lower resolution and massages it to look higher resolution\u2014offering better performance.\nPlayStation\u2019s lead architect, Mark Cerny, has said Sony plans to bring FSR 4 to the PlayStation 5 Pro. That PS5 with the upgraded GPU could simply be a stopgap for what\u2019s coming. Multiple reports have stated PlayStation is crafting a handheld alongside a PlayStation 6, which rumormongers have dubbed \u201cProject Orion.\u201d Previous rumors suggested that the PS6 is functionally complete, though whether it will come in 2026 or 2027 is still up in the air. We don\u2019t yet know if the PlayStation is working with AMD on similar chip microarchitecture for its console, but the handheld may be able to play PS5 games at lower power. Last week, Sony rolled out a console update that enabled a power savings mode. This change has leakers crowing that this will be the same technique used for a handheld to run at a lower resolution and save on battery.\nImagine if the next-gen PlayStation and Xbox offered a PC-like experience without the obtuse cost of a modern gaming PC. Xbox President Sarah Bond has already suggested Microsoft\u2019s gaming arm is crafting something that will feel more like a PC. Sony will still be more constrained considering its love for its exclusive ecosystem, but even that\u2019s slowly changing. Sony has pushed most of its high-profile games to PC. A job listing for PlayStation suggests Sony wants to bring its games to Xbox and Nintendo consoles. The end result is more games will be available to both platforms.\nEven if these devices are cheaper than third-party PCs, they likely won\u2019t be cheap. Already, the Xbox Series X and PS5 are pushing the bounds of what players are willing to pay at $500 each. The $700 PS5 Pro initially sold well, but sales reportedly lagged behind the PS4 Pro in the beginning of the year, according to industry analyst Mat Piscatella. How much are players really willing to pay? If the 2026 consoles cost even more, they\u2019ll make the $450 Switch 2 seem like a bargain. Nintendo\u2019s sequel Switch has become the fastest-selling console ever in U.S. history, according to data from Piscatella\u2019s analyst firm Circana.\nAt the very least, next year\u2019s hardware releases will be far from boring."
