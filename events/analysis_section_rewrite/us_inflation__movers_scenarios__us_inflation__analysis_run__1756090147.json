      "feedback": "The draft commendably deploys a regime framework with three anchors and data-driven transitions, and it properly ties macro policy, crypto flows, and pricing to cross-asset transmission, but it needs sharper causal rigor, tighter horizon delineation, and firmer, sourced quantification to reach world-class quality. Actionable edits: 1) crystallize a crisp base-case tree (0–3, 0–6, 6–12 months) with explicit, testable triggers for A→B and B→C (e.g., inflation drifting to 2% with payroll resilience for A→B; regulatory depth and ETF/corporate-treasury uptake for B→C) and accompanying invalidation clauses anchored to concrete data points (e.g., OB/BB package delays beyond a defined window; AI-diffusion undershooting Range benchmarks; HeartSciences milestones stalling); 2) convert broad qualitative statements into quantified, source-backed facts (e.g., 2% target and 4.25–4.50% policy rate in Regime A; ETF inflows, ETH/BTC staking economics, and corporate treasuries as drivers; price anchors like ETH 4,955 and BTC multi-year highs) with citations to the exact IDs; 3) strengthen the causal chain from regime state to asset prices by mapping each regime to explicit price/valuation channels (discount-rate movement, term premia, crypto-flow sufficiency, cross-asset contagion) and show how changes propagate to expected price ranges or multiples; 4) tighten the scenario structure by presenting parallel, mutually exclusive Up/Down paths with non-overlapping probability mass (sum close to 100% per horizon) and clearly labeled catalysts for each path; 5) reduce overreliance on broad narrative phrases and replace them with precise, trackable metrics (NPI/Range AI adoption momentum, ETF inflow depth, GENIUS/Project Crypto regulatory progress, oil-path sensitivities) while ensuring every numeric claim references a source ID; 6) ensure formatting discipline so the final output (if you reuse the 4-item Up/Down schema) stays within the required format and uses only in-text IDs to support asserted numbers; 7) scan for internal conflicts or contradictions across sources (e.g., divergent views on ETF inflow strength or regulatory timing) and reconcile via ranges or a transparency note about dispersion. If you want, I can deliver a tightened 4-line Up/Down output aligned to the format, with probabilities anchored to the citations and a clean, testable regime-tree.",
