  "title": "Epstein's former girlfriend told Justice Department she did not see Trump act in 'inappropriate way'",
  "description": "Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s imprisoned former girlfriend repeatedly denied to the Justice Department witnessing any sexually inappropriate interactions with Donald Trump.",
  "content": "A photo of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell is displayed during a U.S. prosecutor\u2019s news conference in New York in 2020.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s imprisoned former girlfriend, repeatedly denied in her interview with the Justice Department having witnessed any sexually inappropriate interactions with Donald Trump, according to records released Friday meant to distance the president from the sex-trafficking case.\n\nThe Trump administration issued transcripts from interviews that Deputy Atty. Gen. Todd Blanche conducted with Maxwell last month as the administration was scrambling to present itself as transparent amid a fierce backlash over its refusal to disclose a trove of records from the case.\n\nThe records show Maxwell repeatedly showering Trump with praise and denying under questioning from Blanche that she had observed Trump engaged in any form of sexual behavior. The administration was presumably eager to make such denials public at a time when Trump has faced questions about his former longtime friendship with Epstein and as his administration has endured continued scrutiny over its handling of evidence from the case.\n\nThe transcript release represents the latest Trump administration effort to repair self-inflicted political wounds after failing to deliver on expectations that its own officials had created through conspiracy theories and bold pronouncements that never came to pass. By making public two days\u2019 worth of interviews, officials appear to be hoping to at least temporarily keep at bay sustained anger from Trump\u2019s base as they send Congress evidence they had previously kept from view.\n\nAfter her interview with Blanche, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas to continue serving a 20-year sentence for her 2021 conviction for luring underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein.\n\nHer trial featured sordid accounts of the sexual exploitation of girls as young as 14 told by four women who described being abused as teens in the 1990s and early 2000s at Epstein\u2019s homes.\n\nShe was convicted of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, conspiracy to transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, transporting a minor to participate in illegal sex acts, sex trafficking conspiracy, and sex trafficking of a minor.\n\nVictims of Epstein and Maxwell and victims\u2019 family members, among others, have expressed outrage at her prison relocation and the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the case.\n\nNeither Maxwell\u2019s lawyers nor the federal Bureau of Prisons has explained the reason for the move, but one of her lawyers, David Oscar Markus, said in a social media post Friday that Maxwell was \u201cinnocent and never should have been tried, much less convicted.\u201d\n\nMaxwell is widely believed to be seeking a presidential pardon, which Trump has not ruled out.\n\n\u201cI actually never saw the president in any type of massage setting,\u201d Maxwell said, according to the transcript. \u201cI never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way. The president was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.\u201d\n\nMaxwell recalled knowing about Trump and possibly meeting him for the first time in 1990, when her newspaper magnate father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the New York Daily News. She said she had been to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., sometimes alone, but hadn\u2019t seen Trump since the mid-2000s.\n\nAsked if she ever heard Epstein or anyone else say Trump \u201chad done anything inappropriate with masseuses\u201d or anyone else in their orbit, Maxwell replied, \u201cAbsolutely never, in any context.\u201d\n\nMaxwell was interviewed over the course of two days last month by Blanche \u2014 one of Trump\u2019s personal lawyers before joining the Justice Department \u2014 at a Florida courthouse. She was given limited immunity, allowing her to speak freely without fear of prosecution for anything she said except in the event of a false statement.\n\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department on Friday began sending to the House Oversight Committee records from the investigation that the panel says it intends to make public after removing victims\u2019 information.\n\nThe case had long captured public attention in part because of Epstein\u2019s social connections over the years to prominent figures, including Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew, former President Clinton and Trump, who has said he had a falling-out with Epstein years ago and well before the financier came under investigation.\n\nMaxwell told Blanche that Clinton was initially her friend, not Epstein\u2019s, and that she never saw him receive a massage \u2014 nor did she believe he ever did. The only times they were together, she said, were the two dozen or so times they traveled on Epstein\u2019s plane.\n\n\u201cThat would\u2019ve been the only time that I think that President Clinton could have even received a massage,\u201d Maxwell said. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t, because I was there.\u201d\n\nShe also spoke glowingly of Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew and dismissed as \u201crubbish\u201d the late Virginia Giuffre\u2019s claim that she was paid to have a relationship with Andrew and that he had sex with her at Maxwell\u2019s London home.\n\nMaxwell sought to distance herself from Epstein\u2019s conduct, repeatedly denying allegations made during her trial about her role. Though she acknowledged that at one point Epstein began preferring younger women, she claimed she never understood that to \u201cencompass children.\u201d Prosecutors presented evidence at trial showing she and Epstein both knew some victims were underage.\n\n\u201cI did see from when I met him, he was involved, or \u2014 involved or friends with or whatever, however you want to characterize it \u2014 with women who were in their 20s,\u201d she told Blanche. \u201cAnd then the slide to, you know, 18 or younger looking women. But I never considered that this would encompass criminal behavior.\u201d\n\nEpstein was arrested in 2019 on sex-trafficking charges, accused of sexually abusing dozens of teenage girls, and was found dead a month later in a New York jail cell in what investigators determined was suicide.\n\nThe saga has consumed the Trump administration following a two-page announcement from the FBI and Justice Department last month that Epstein had killed himself despite conspiracy theories to the contrary, that a \u201cclient list\u201d that Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi had intimated was on her desk did not actually exist, and that no additional documents from the high-profile investigation were suitable to be released.\n\nThe announcement produced outrage from conspiracy theorists, online sleuths and Trump supporters who had been hoping to see proof of a government cover-up during previous administrations. That expectation was driven in part by comments from officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who on podcasts before taking their current positions had repeatedly promoted the idea that damaging details about prominent people were being withheld.\n\nPatel, for instance, said in at least one podcast interview before becoming director that Epstein\u2019s \u201cblack book\u201d was under the \u201cdirect control of the director of the FBI.\u201d\n\nThe administration made a stumble in February when far-right influencers were invited to the White House in February and provided by Bondi with binders marked \u201cThe Epstein Files: Phase 1\u201d and \u201cDeclassified\u201d that contained documents that had largely already been in the public domain.\n\nAfter the first release fell flat, Bondi said officials were poring over a \u201ctruckload\u201d of previously withheld evidence she said had been handed over by the FBI and raised expectations of forthcoming releases.\n\nBut after a weeks-long review of evidence in the government\u2019s possession, the Justice Department determined that no \u201cfurther disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\u201d The department noted that much of the material was placed under seal by a court to protect victims and \u201conly a fraction\u201d of it \u201cwould have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial.\u201d\n\nFaced with fury from his base, Trump sought to quickly turn the page, shutting down questioning of Bondi about Epstein at a White House Cabinet meeting and deriding as \u201cweaklings\u201d his own supporters who he said were falling for the \u201cJeffrey Epstein hoax.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department has responded to a subpoena from House lawmakers by pledging to turn over information.\n\nTucker, Sisak and Richer write for the Associated Press.

Gavin Newsom over Harjinder Singh, a native of India who obtained a work permit and driver\u2019s license in the state.\nSingh was charged with three state counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations, and he was denied bond on all charges. He is being held in the St. Lucie County Jail, Lt. Andrew Bolonka from the St. Lucie County Sheriff\u2019s Office said. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has put a hold on him.\nHomeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said issuing a commercial license to someone in the country illegally is \u201casinine.\u201d California is one of 19 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, that issues licenses regardless of immigration status. Supporters say that lets people work, visit doctors and travel safely.\nNewsom\u2019s press office responded in a social media post on X that Singh obtained a work permit while Donald Trump was president, which McLaughlin disputed.\nFlorida authorities said Singh entered the U.S. illegally from Mexico in 2018.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis dispatched Lt. Gov. Jay Collins to California to escort Singh onto an airplane Thursday.\nSingh made the illegal turn on the highway about 50 miles north of West Palm Beach, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. A minivan in the neighboring lane was unable to avoid the truck\u2019s trailer and slammed into it, killing the minivan\u2019s driver and two passengers.\nSingh and a passenger in his truck were not injured."

      "text": "More human-trafficking survivors are seeking visas but face longer waits and risk deportation\n- Share via\nThe T visa, an underutilized lifeline for immigrant survivors of human trafficking, is experiencing a sharp rise in applications, despite increasing processing times and deportation risks.\nAlso known as T nonimmigrant status, the visa allows people who have experienced severe forms of human trafficking to remain in the country for up to four years if they are helpful to law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of their trafficker. Approved applicants can work in the U.S., are eligible for certain state and federal benefits, and can apply for a green card after three years on the visa (or earlier if the criminal case is closed).\nJulie Dahlstrom, founder and director of the Human Trafficking Clinic at Boston University, said increased awareness of the visa and the courts\u2019 expanding definitions of trafficking may have contributed to the increase, along with mounting barriers to other pathways for immigrant relief.\nCongress created the T visa in 2000 as part of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act, intending to bolster law enforcement agencies\u2019 capabilities to prosecute human trafficking crimes while offering protections to survivors. The same law also established the U visa, which provides legal status for victims who have suffered substantial abuse as a result of serious crimes including trafficking, domestic violence and sexual assault. U visa applicants must also be willing to assist law enforcement in their investigation of these crimes.\n\u201cMany [applicants] are eligible for the U visa as well, but they\u2019re taking now over 20 years for an individual to get access \u2026 so I think that has influenced lawyers and survivors, if they are eligible for the T visa \u2026 to go ahead and also file T visa applications,\u201d Dahlstrom said. \u201cEspecially under the Trump administration, we\u2019ve seen more barriers to asylum access, special immigrant juvenile status access, so I expect we\u2019ll continue to see that move.\u201d\nUSCIS updated the T visa rules in August 2024 with a process called called bona fide determination that gave survivors earlier access to benefits while their application is pending approval. It also granted them deferred action, which places individuals on a lower priority for removal proceedings.\nErika Gonzalez, training and technical assistance managing attorney from the Coalition to Abolish Slavery & Trafficking, explained that although early access to benefits had existed in the federal statute, it was never implemented because applications were processing fast enough to not need it.\n\u201cThey have updated the [bona fide determination] process to now have a formal process to engage with, and it does parallel with the sharp increases in filing,\u201d Gonzalez said.\nAs T visa applications rose, so too did approvals. Last year, the number of approvals broke 3,000 for the first time though it still fell short of the 5,000 cap.\nProcessing times for T visas have also increased, jumping from a median of 5.9 months in 2014 to 19.9 months this fiscal year.\nDenial rates for T visas, meanwhile, have fluctuated.\n\u201cWe were seeing increased denial rates under the prior Trump administration and then improved rates under Biden,\u201d Dahlstrom said.\nDenials can leave T visa applicants vulnerable to deportation. In 2018, USCIS began allowing removal proceedings if an application was rejected with a notice to appear (NTA).\nAccording to a 2022 report co-written by Dahlstrom, which obtained USCIS data through Freedom of Information Act litigation, USCIS issued a total of 236 NTAs to denied T visa applicants from 2019 to 2021. President Biden rescinded this policy with a January 2021 executive order, but last February, USCIS published new guidance once more expanding the circumstances where the agency could issue NTAs.\nThese policies, alongside escalated coordination between law enforcement and other agencies, have heightened fear among survivors applying for the T visa, Dahlstrom explained.\n\u201cWe are seeing in real time the results of including requirements around law enforcement engagement, especially when there\u2019s greater cooperation with ICE and greater concerns about deportation,\u201d Dahlstrom said. \u201cThese programs are being politicized and, in some ways, weaponized if you\u2019re denied and you\u2019re placed in proceedings.\u201d\nSince February\u2019s policy update, at least one person has self-deported after Immigration and Customs Enforcement denied her stay despite her pending T visa application.\nSo far in the fiscal year 2025, USCIS has approved 1,035 T-visas and rejected 693, which surpasses the number rejected in each of the last four years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell what we\u2019re going to see, but if we continue to see these numbers, it\u2019s both going to mean a rise in denials and very few cases adjudicated amidst more and more applications being filed, which is really troubling,\u201d Dahlstrom said. \u201cThese are statutorily protected programs, but what they can do is really slow them down, make them ineffective just in the way that they\u2019re processing applications.\u201d"

      "text": "Ghislaine Maxwell Sentenced To 20 Years In Prison For Conspiring With Jeffrey Epstein To Sexually Abuse Minors\nDamian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was sentenced today in Manhattan federal court by United States Circuit Judge Alison J. Nathan to 240 months in prison for her role in a scheme to sexual exploit and abuse multiple minor girls with Jeffrey Epstein over the course of a decade. MAXWELL was previously found guilty on December 29, 2021, following a one-month jury trial, of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, conspiracy to transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, transporting a minor to participate in illegal sex acts, sex trafficking conspiracy, and sex trafficking of a minor.\nU.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: \u201cToday\u2019s sentence holds Ghislaine Maxwell accountable for perpetrating heinous crimes against children. This sentence sends a strong message that no one is above the law and it is never too late for justice. We again express our gratitude to Epstein and Maxwell\u2019s victims for their courage in coming forward, in testifying at trial, and in sharing their stories as part of today\u2019s sentencing.\u201d\nAccording to the allegations in the Indictment, court documents, and evidence presented at trial:\nFrom at least 1994, up to and including in or about 2004, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated in Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein\u2019s residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse.\nMAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, their schools, and their families, and taking them to the movies or on shopping trips. MAXWELL also acclimated victims to Epstein\u2019s conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein\u2019s behavior. Additionally, Epstein offered to help some victims by paying for travel and/or educational opportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept Epstein\u2019s assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to help them. MAXWELL also normalized and facilitated sexual abuse for a victim by discussing sexual topics, undressing in front of the victim, being present when the victim was undressed, and encouraging the victim to massage Epstein.\nAs MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. In some instances, MAXWELL participated in the sexual abuse of minor victims.\nUltimately minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching of a victim\u2019s breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim\u2019s genitals, directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein\u2019s genitals. MAXWELL and Epstein\u2019s victims were groomed or abused at Epstein\u2019s residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as well as MAXWELL\u2019s residence in London, England.\nIn the earlier phase of the conspiracy, from at least approximately 1994 through approximately 2001, MAXWELL and Epstein identified vulnerable girls, typically from single-mother households and difficult financial circumstances. This earlier phase required the defendant and Epstein to identify one girl at a time to target for grooming and abuse. In the later phase, from approximately 2001 until at least approximately 2004, MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, minor girls to visit Epstein\u2019s Palm Beach Residence to engage in sex acts with Epstein, after which Epstein, MAXWELL, or another employee of Epstein\u2019s would give the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. MAXWELL and Epstein encouraged one or more of those victims to travel with Epstein with the intention that the victim engage in sex acts with Epstein. Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his supply of victims, MAXWELL and Epstein also paid certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. In this way, MAXWELL and Epstein created a network of underage victims for Epstein to sexually exploit.\n* * *\nIn addition to the prison sentence, MAXWELL, 60, was sentenced to five years of supervised release and ordered to pay a $750,00 fine.\nMr. Williams praised the outstanding work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nThis case is being handled by the Office\u2019s Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach are in charge of the prosecution.\nNicholas Biase\nVictoria Bosah\n(212) 637-2600"

Mat\u00edas and her daughters were among more than 300 undocumented immigrants \u2014 including at least 10 minors \u2014 who, according to U.S. authorities, were detained at a pair of Glass House sites.\nThe raids, like other such operations across the United States, split many so-called mixed-status families, those with both U.S.-born citizens \u2014 often children \u2014 and undocumented relatives, typically one or both parents.\nMat\u00edas\u2019 family life is, by any definition, complicated, including seven daughters in all. Her two youngest daughters, aged 2 and 5, are U.S. citizens, born in California. Her 2-year-old grandson \u2014the child of Mat\u00edas\u2019 16-year-old daughter \u2014 is also a native Californian. So when Mat\u00edas was held in a federal lockup in downtown Los Angeles, she faced a momentous choice \u2014 one that would mark her family for life.\nAs fear over ICE raids mounts across Los Angeles, undocumented families are grappling with how to handle crucial conversations with their children.\nMat\u00edas, 43, could accept removal to Mexico. But that might effectively banish her from returning to the United States, where she had toiled as a fieldworker for most of the past quarter-century \u2014 and where she had deep family ties.\nAlternatively, she could fight expulsion in court. But that would leave her in custody, possibly indefinitely.\n\u201cThey told me I could be locked up for months, maybe a year, and never see my children,\u201d Mat\u00edas said, recalling what U.S. agents informed her in Los Angeles. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t endure that.\u201d\nInstead, Mat\u00edas said, she agreed to return voluntarily to Mexico, but with a caveat: She had to be accompanied by her two youngest daughters and her grandson. After some haggling \u2014 federal authorities initially balked at sending U.S. citizen minors to Mexico, Mat\u00edas said \u2014 an agreement was reached. (The Department of Homeland Security didn\u2019t respond to inquiries from The Times.)\nShe and four daughters \u2014 the two undocumented teenagers who worked at Glass House and the two U.S. citizen youngsters \u2014 were soon in a van en route to Tijuana. The U.S.-born grandson was also with them.\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d an agent told Mat\u00edas upon letting the family out at the border. \u201cYou\u2019re back in your country now.\u201d\nBack to Yojuela\nThe hamlet of Yojuela is home to some 500 people \u2014 all of Indigenous Zapotec origins \u2014 who reside deep in the Sierra Madre Oriental, in Mexico\u2019s southern Oaxaca state. The area is known for its clay pottery, fired from distinctive reddish earth, and for something else \u2014 dispatching its offspring to work in the fields of California, supporting loved ones left behind in a time-tested rite of passage.\nThe scripted sequel is the triumphant homecoming of those who moved on but never forsook their roots. These days, however, many return to places like Yojuela broke and embittered, casualties of President Trump\u2019s deportation onslaught.\nMat\u00edas and her family showed up last month, just 20 days after she was detained. She had last set foot here seven years earlier.\n\u201cThis is where I was born and reared,\u201d Mat\u00edas said with both resignation and pride, ushering visitors onto a verdant patch shimmering in the aftermath of recent rains.\nReaching the ancestral hearth involves a two-hour, uphill drive on a washboard road from the nearest city, and then a short hike \u2014 across a stream and up a steep hill, past fields of corn and beans and stands of pine, all to a soundtrack of clucking turkeys and braying donkeys.\nAccompanying Mat\u00edas were two U.S.-born daughters, Arisbeth, 2, and Keilani, a onetime Oxnard preschooler who turned 5 in Tijuana. Also present were Mat\u00edas\u2019 16-year-old daughter, Ailed, and Ailed\u2019s U.S.-born son, Liam Yair, 2.\nI\u2019d like like to go back to California\n\u2014 Ailed Lorenzo Mat\u00edas\nIt marked the first time that the native Californians met their extended family, including a platoon of curious cousins.\nSeasoned to the periodic reunion ritual was Cecilia Aquino, mother of Mat\u00edas and her five siblings\u2014 all of whom had made the trek to California. For decades, her adobe dwelling hosted waves of grandchildren and great-grandchildren as sons and daughters went back and forth, entrusting expanding broods to the matriarch.\nMat\u00edas and her mother, now 72, embraced, no words needed. Each examined the other closely. Time had taken its melancholic toll.\n\u201cAll of my children had to go away and leave their kids with me \u2014 there\u2019s no work here,\u201d said Aquino, worn down by years of toil, as she prepared coffee on a kindling-fired stove. \u201cThen they come back. Then they leave again. It\u2019s sad. The children never really get to know their parents. I wish the officials on the other side [of the border] would let them be together.\u201d\nLeaving home\nMat\u00edas joined the migrant trail as a teenager, following the harvests \u2014 strawberries, celery, broccoli and more \u2014 from California to the Pacific Northwest. Through the years, she gave birth to her seven daughters \u2014 four in the United States, three in Mexico \u2014 as she crisscrossed the border a dozen times.\n\u201cI was always a single mother, always battling on my own for my children,\u201d Mat\u00edas said. \u201cI earned everything through my own sweat and toil. The fathers of my kids never gave me anything.\u201d\nHer last journey north, in 2018, was the most difficult, as the once-porous international boundary had become a militarized bulwark. She vowed it would be her last crossing. Four years ago, she said, she secured work at Glass House Farms, a major player in the legalized cannabis boom.\n\u201cIt was the best job I ever had,\u201d she said.\nThere was no backbreaking stooping: Trimmers sat on benches. The pounding sun wasn\u2019t an issue in the temperature-controlled facilities.\nMat\u00edas said she rose to become a crew chief, overseeing 240 workers. She said she earned more than $20 an hour, and, with overtime, regularly grossed in excess of $1,000 a week \u2014 a unfathomable haul in Oaxaca, where field hands pocket the equivalent of about $10 a day.\nHer plan, she said, was to remain in California until she turned 65, then retire to Yojuela, using savings to open a shop.\n\u201cI never wanted to stay forever in Oxnard,\u201d she said.\nThen came July 10.\n\u2018Total chaos\u2019\n\u201cPeople were running all over the place,\u201d Mat\u00edas recalled of the raid. \u201cSome tried to hide inside the greenhouses. Others crawled inside the ventilation shafts. It was total chaos.\u201d\nOne worker, Jaime Alanis Garc\u00eda, 56, died from injuries suffered when he fell from a greenhouse roof, apparently while trying to evade arrest.\nBlocking any escape for herself and her two daughters, Mat\u00edas said, were los militares \u2014 heavily armed U.S. agents in martial getup.\nThe farmworker who suffered fatal injuries while fleeing an immigration raid in Ventura County was buried in his Mexican hometown.\nThat evening, Mat\u00edas said, she spent a sleepless night in detention in downtown Los Angeles. The next day, she accepted a \u201cvoluntary return\u201d to Mexico.\nFor almost a week, the family stayed in a shelter in Tijuana, awaiting the arrival of her male partner and the boyfriend of her 19-year-old-daughter. Both were also among the of Glass House detainees. The three-day bus ride south included a frenzied, crosstown change of terminals in Mexico City at midnight to catch the last coach for Oaxaca.\nWith her remaining savings, Mat\u00edas purchased an unfinished, cinder-block house on the outskirts of Miahuatl\u00e1n de Porfirio D\u00edaz, a historic but drab city that hosts a federal prison. It\u2019s about a two-hour drive on a rough track from Yojuela, but offers baseline schooling and job prospects.\nThe expulsion to Mexico shattered a family that had attained a modicum \u2014 perhaps an illusion \u2014 of stability in California.\nLike her mother, Ailed Lorenzo Mat\u00edas, 16, succumbed to the siren call of the border. She was 14 when she and her boyfriend crossed into California. She struggled to climb the fence and descend on the U.S. side, worrying about her baby. She was five months pregnant.\nThe other day, Ailed sat in a stairwell of the new home in Miahuatl\u00e1n, cuddling her son. They were sharing a video call to Oxnard with the boy\u2019s father, who also worked at Glass House. But, in a twist of fate, he was off duty on July 10.\n\u201cI\u2019d like like to go back to California,\u201d the soft-spoken Ailed said. \u201cMy son was born there. And that\u2019s where his pap\u00e1 is.\u201d\nUnlike Ailed, her sister, Natalia Lorenzo Mat\u00edas, 19, has no intention of returning.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to go back,\u201d Natalia said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a real life there. You spend your time working and locked in your house, always afraid that you will be arrested.\u201d\nHer mother is deeply tormented but endeavors to conceal her despair. \u201cI have to be strong for the kids,\u201d Mat\u00edas said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m alone, I begin to cry.\u201d\nAmong those at Thursday\u2019s immigration action was a Trump voter who doesn\u2019t like the president\u2019s approach and the family of a National Guardsman who say it\u2019s time for him to come home.\nShe says she understands Trump\u2019s point: He wants to deport criminals. But, she asks, why target hardworking immigrants?\n\u201cIn all my years in the north,\u201d she said, \u201cI never saw an American working in the fields.\u201d\nHer plan, she says, is to stabilize the family, enroll her 5-year-old in school, find some work \u2014 and, then, perhaps in a year or two, set off once more.\nFor now, though, Mat\u00edas says she is concentrated on helping her family adjust to a new way of life \u2014 albeit, she hopes, a transitory one, until they get back on the road to California.\nSpecial correspondents Cecilia S\u00e1nchez Vidal and Liliana Nieto del R\u00edo contributed."

  "argos_summary": "Transcripts of Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche were released by the Trump administration, showing her denying any knowledge of Donald Trump\u2019s involvement in Epstein\u2019s sex\u2011trafficking scheme, a move aimed at deflecting criticism as the administration struggled to disclose evidence from the case. The release comes amid ongoing controversy over the Justice Department\u2019s handling of Epstein records, Maxwell\u2019s 20\u2011year conviction and sentencing, and her recent prison relocation, while victims and advocates continue to demand transparency. Separate stories in the article cover a truck driver denied bond after a fatal crash, the rise and challenges of the T\u2011visa for trafficking survivors, and the forced return of a Mexican family from a California cannabis farm raid, highlighting broader immigration enforcement tensions. Together, the pieces illustrate the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to manage fallout from the Epstein scandal, its immigration policy controversies, and the human impact of enforcement actions.",
