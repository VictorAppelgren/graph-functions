  "content": "WASHINGTON, DC (August 24, 2025) \u2013 With District schools and the majority of Maryland schools kicking off the 2025-26 school year tomorrow, students across the region will be returning to campuses and classrooms, and transportation will undoubtedly be impacted. Back-to-school transportation affects not only students and parents, but also other motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians using the roads.\n\n\"This time of year is particularly dangerous. Young, inexperienced drivers heading to high school, school buses, commuters, parents doing drop-offs, and pedestrians and bicyclists are all sharing the road,\" said Ragina Cooper Ali, spokesperson for AAA in Maryland and Washington, DC. \u201cWhile traffic patterns may change, the responsibility for keeping students safe does not. It's important that all drivers, as well as students, remain alert and follow basic precautions for a safe return to school.\u201d\n\nSchool bus safety should be a top priority, with students, parents, teachers, administrators, transportation personnel and the motoring public all playing important roles in keeping children safe while on or around a school bus. All too often, drivers are in a hurry or driving distracted and drive around a school bus, despite the bus displaying a stop arm and flashing lights.\n\n\u201cThese drivers don\u2019t realize the dangers of this behavior, but everyone needs to follow the rules of the road, and that includes stopping for school buses. School bus stopping laws are in place to protect our children going to and from school. Ignoring them puts children in danger and could end in tragedy,\u201d Ali adds. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), all 50 states have a law that makes it illegal to pass a school bus with its red flashing lights on and its stop-arm extended.\n\nMaryland law requires motorists from any direction to stop when a school bus is stopped along a roadway, picking up or letting off passengers, with the stop arm and signal lights activated. Drivers should not proceed again until the bus is back in motion. Violation of these laws will result in a $250 fine if caught on camera, and up to $570 and a three-point penalty on a driver\u2019s license if stopped by a police officer. Virginia law requires drivers from either direction to stop when a school bus is stopped, picking up or letting off passengers, whether the stop arm and signal lights are activated or not. Drivers should not proceed again until the bus is back in motion. The exception is when a driver is on the opposite side of a road where there is a barrier or median.\n\nAAA offers the following tips as the new school year gets under way:\n\u2022 Always stop for school buses \u2013 Flashing yellow lights on a school bus indicate it is preparing to stop to load or unload children and motorists should slow down and prepare to stop as well. Red flashing lights and extended stop arm indicate the bus has stopped and children are getting on or off. Motorists are required to stop their vehicles and wait until the red lights stop flashing, the extended stop arm is withdrawn and the bus begins moving before they can start driving again.\n\u2022 Obey traffic signs and signals \u2013 Unfortunately, many motorists violate stop signs in school zones and residential neighborhoods, with many failing to come to a complete stop, rolling through a stop sign or not slowing down at all. Motorists are also running red stoplights, putting pedestrians and other motorists at risk.\n\u2022 Keep track of time \u2013 Be aware of the time of day you\u2019re on the road and how that coincides with the school day. Not surprisingly, more school-age pedestrians are killed from 7 to 8 a.m. and from 3 to 4 p.m. than any other hours of the day.\n\u2022 Slow down \u2013 Whether in a school zone or residential neighborhood, drivers should keep their speed low and be prepared to stop quickly for increased vehicle or pedestrian traffic.\n\u2022 Come to a complete stop \u2013 Always come to a complete stop, checking carefully for children on sidewalks and in crosswalks before proceeding.\n\u2022 Eliminate distractions \u2013 Research shows that taking your eyes off the road for just two seconds doubles your chances of crashing. Children can be quick, crossing the road unexpectedly or emerging suddenly between two parked cars. Reduce risk by not using your cell phone while driving. With many parents dropping off and picking up their children at school, motorists can expect increased traffic congestion near schools. With cars entering and leaving parking lots and lining the streets, motorists are reminded that extra caution and reduced speeds are necessary in school zones. The start of the school year can be particularly dangerous, with new routines for parents and children. AAA has the following reminders for parents intending to drive their children to school:\n\u2022 Follow school drop-off and pick-up procedures and be mindful that these may have changed from the previous year.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t double park. It blocks visibility for other children and vehicles.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t load or unload children across the street from the school.\n\u2022 Have children exit the vehicle on the \u201ccurb side\u201d every time (so they aren\u2019t opening the car door into an oncoming traffic lane or crossing around the front/back of car to get to curb).\n\u2022 Slow down, eliminate distractions and watch for children.\n\nRed-light running has continued to plague Maryland and the nation. Considered an aggressive driving behavior, red-light running is often accompanied by another bad driving behavior\u2015speeding. \u201cOver 1,000 people are killed across the country every year due to someone running a red light. All those deaths were preventable. Motorists should not be driving distracted nor put their own desires to be on their way ahead of the safety of other motorists, vehicle passengers and pedestrians, including school children and parents,\u201d warns Ali. Even children not walking the entire route to school are often walking to a school bus stop. AAA has the following reminders for students as the school year gets under way:\n\u2022 Cross only at corners so drivers can see you. Never cross between parked cars or mid-block.\n\u2022 Use a crosswalk when it\u2019s available. Don\u2019t assume that because you can see the driver, the driver can see you. Always use caution when crossing.\n\u2022 Look all ways before crossing. Look and listen for cars, pedestrians and bicyclists.\n\u2022 Once you have confirmed traffic has stopped, cross when the light indicates it is safe to cross without further hesitation so you have time to cross safely.\n\u2022 Use the crosswalk push-button signal when possible and cross when the signal allows.\n\u2022 Watch for cars that are turning left or right when crossing.\n\u2022 Walk on a sidewalk when it is provided. If you must walk in the street, walk facing traffic on the left side of the road and as far to the left as possible.\n\u2022 Make it easy for drivers to see you. Dress in light colors, wear reflective material or use a flashlight.\n\u2022 Remove headphones and don\u2019t use cell phones or electronic devices when crossing the street.\n\u2022 Watch for white lights on the rear of vehicles, signaling backing up in driveways or parking lots.\n\nFor some children, the new school year may mark the first time they are allowed to ride their bike to school. But even older children can benefit from refreshers on following traffic laws and taking safe paths to school. \u201cDistracted drivers, red light runners and motorists with other bad driving behaviors continue to pose a threat to other road users, including children riding their bicycles to school,\u201d says Ali. \u201cWhether this is the first year for your child to ride their bike to school or they\u2019ve been doing so for several years, all children can benefit from a refresher this time of year on the rules of the road and how to stay safe.\u201d AAA offers a number of tips for children riding their bicycles to school:\n\u2022 Make sure your child has the skills to ride a bike safely, such as riding in a straight line and signaling to vehicles when turning.\n\u2022 Choose the safest route to bike to school, one with less traffic and slower speeds. Use bike paths if they are available.\n\u2022 Make sure your cyclists understand traffic safety rules, such as riding in the same direction as traffic and stopping at all stop signs and signals.\n\u2022 Explain the importance of wearing a bike helmet to your child. They\u2019re critical to minimizing injury in case of a crash. According to the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety, wearing a helmet can reduce the odds of head injury by half.\n\u2022 Ride focused and alert. Never use earbuds or electronics while riding. \u201cNo matter the plan, no matter the mode of transportation, everyone needs to remain vigilant \u2013 put down the phone, look up, and pay attention to help students get to and from school safely,\u201d says Ali.",

      "text": "School buses are the safest way for children to get to school. Still, children are especially vulnerable as they get on and off the bus. In Maryland, bus safety laws are in place to help drivers safely navigate the roads where children might be crossing.\nMaryland School Bus Laws\nThough school buses are designed to prioritize safety, children are vulnerable when waiting for, boarding or leaving the bus. The 10-foot area extending from each side of the bus is considered a danger zone for children, so laws are intended to keep all cars away whenever children will be in that area. When a school bus prepares to stop for children, it will alert drivers via flashing yellow lights. Drivers should use extreme caution, slowing with the bus and preparing to stop, as children may enter the roadway unexpectedly. Once the bus is stopped, it will extend a stop signal, or stop-arm, and the flashing lights will change to red \u2014 requiring all drivers to stop no closer than 20 feet from the bus. During this period, children will be getting on or off the bus. Drivers must come to a complete stop if any of the following are true:\n- A driver is traveling the same direction as the school bus. This is true whether the road has one lane, multiple lanes, or a central turning lane.\n- A driver is traveling in the opposite direction and the road does NOT have a dirt, grass, or barrier median. In other words, if there is no physical median, you must stop even if the bus is on the other side of the road. (Note: In some states, you must stop for school buses even on a divided highway.)\nRemember, drivers must stop at least 20 feet from the bus, regardless of which direction they\u2019re approaching. They must not attempt to pass by the bus until the stop signal and flashing lights are off and the bus is in motion once again. Violation of these laws incurs a $250 fine if caught on camera, and up to $570 and a three-point penalty on a driver\u2019s license if stopped by a police officer.\nSafety Tips for Drivers\n- Remain alert while driving. If you are distracted by your phone or other things within or outside the vehicle, you could miss seeing a child in the roadway, or miss seeing the stopped school bus with its lights flashing.\n- If you\u2019re behind a school bus that is slowing to a stop, do not try to pass it before it puts out its signal to avoid the wait. You could strike a child who is running to catch the bus.\n- Remember that children often move in a way that is unexpected, and they may not know where to look for traffic. You know the rules of the road; often they do not.\n- When backing out of a driveway or leaving a garage, be especially mindful of children walking or biking to school.\n- Never assume children see or hear your car, or that they\u2019re aware you\u2019re approaching. If you see them, give them the right of way.\n- Watch carefully for children waiting or playing at the bus stop. They may enter the roadway accidentally.\n- If you live in a neighborhood near a school, watch out for children who are walking or biking to or from school.\nKeeping Children Safe\nAs a parent or caregiver, teach children these basic safety tips to help them avoid getting hurt on the way to or from school.\n- Be on time. Children are in danger of being injured if they are running for the bus because they think they\u2019ll miss it. Try to be at the stop at least five minutes before scheduled pick-up.\n- Keep a safe distance from the road. Teach children not to sit, stand or play on the curb while waiting for the bus. Show them a safe spot at least five giant steps away from the bus stop where they should wait.\n- Stay out of the danger zone. Explain to them that standing or walking too close to the bus will make it difficult for the bus driver or other drivers to see them.\n- Wait for the driver\u2019s signal. Teach children to line up when the bus arrives. They should wait until the door opens and the driver signals them to get on before approaching the bus.\n- Board one at a time. Teach children to enter the bus single file.\n- Exit one at a time. Children may need reminders to slow down, use the handrail and exit the bus single file so nobody gets hurt. That\u2019s especially important when it\u2019s the end of the day and they\u2019re excited to get home.\n- Look both ways before getting off the bus. Teach kids to watch for cars when they exit any vehicle, including a school bus. Once they exit, they should walk directly to the sidewalk and out of the danger zone.\n- Cross the street carefully. Before crossing the street, children should be aware to take five giant steps out from the front of the bus if there is no crossing arm and make sure you can see the face of any driver. They should wait for the driver to signal that it\u2019s safe to cross, and look left-right-left when coming to the edge of the bus to make sure traffic is stopped. It\u2019s also important to keep watching traffic when crossing.\n- Never walk behind the bus. Be sure children know to cross the street in front of the bus, never behind it.\n- Tell the driver if you drop something. Teach children never to bend down in front of (or near) a bus if they drop something. The bus driver might not see them.\n- Always use crosswalks and traffic signals when available. Children should always use crossing guards, crosswalks and other helpful traffic controls to get home safely when those resources are available."

      "text": "Title 46.2. Motor Vehicles\nChapter 8. Regulation of Traffic\n\u00a7 46.2-859. Passing a stopped school bus; prima facie evidence.\nA person driving a motor vehicle shall stop such vehicle when approaching, from any direction, any school bus which is stopped on any highway, private road or school driveway for the purpose of taking on or discharging children, elderly individuals, or individuals with mental or physical disabilities, and shall remain stopped until all the individuals are clear of the highway, private road or school driveway and the bus is put in motion; any individual violating the foregoing is guilty of reckless driving. The driver of a vehicle, however, need not stop when approaching a school bus if the school bus is stopped on the other roadway of a divided highway, on an access road, or on a driveway when the other roadway, access road, or driveway is separated from the roadway on which he is driving by a physical barrier or an unpaved area. The driver of a vehicle also need not stop when approaching a school bus which is loading or discharging passengers from or onto property immediately adjacent to a school if the driver is directed by a law-enforcement officer or other duly authorized uniformed school crossing guard to pass the school bus. This section shall apply to school buses which are equipped with warning devices prescribed in \u00a7 46.2-1090 and are painted yellow with the words \"School Bus\" in black letters at least eight inches high on the front and rear thereof. Only school buses which are painted yellow and equipped with the required lettering and warning devices shall be identified as school buses.\nThe testimony of the school bus driver, the supervisor of school buses or a law-enforcement officer that the vehicle was yellow, conspicuously marked as a school bus, and equipped with warning devices as prescribed in \u00a7 46.2-1090 is prima facie evidence that the vehicle is a school bus.\nEvidence that the bus was stopped with at least one warning device prescribed in \u00a7 46.2-1090 activated shall be considered prima facie evidence that the bus was stopped for the purpose of taking on or discharging children, elderly individuals, or individuals with mental or physical disabilities.\nCode 1950, \u00a7\u00a7 46-209, 46-209.1; 1950, p. 880; 1952, c. 671; 1954, cc. 225, 401, 458; 1958, c. 541, \u00a7 46.1-190; 1960, c. 510; 1964, c. 266; 1966, c. 694; 1968, c. 575; 1970, c. 521; 1974, cc. 222, 455; 1975, c. 633; 1978, c. 27; 1979, c. 86; 1981, cc. 333, 585; 1985, c. 148; 1989, c. 727; 2001, c. 126; 2002, c. 541; 2011, cc. 325, 326; 2023, cc. 148, 149, 382."
