  "description": "Shares of department store chain Macy\u2019s (NYSE:M) jumped 19.6% in the morning session after the company reported second-quarter results that beat Wall Street's expectations, raised its full-year forecast, and posted a welcome return to same-store sales growth.",
  "content": "Shares of department store chain Macy\u2019s (NYSE:M) jumped 19.6% in the morning session after the company reported second-quarter results that beat Wall Street's expectations, raised its full-year forecast, and posted a welcome return to same-store sales growth.\n\nhe department store chain's same-store sales, which track sales online and at stores open for at least a year, rose 1.9% year-over-year. This marked a significant turnaround from recent declines, including a 4% drop in the same quarter last year. While total revenue fell 1.9% to $5.00 billion, it still surpassed analysts' estimates. Similarly, adjusted earnings of $0.41 per share were down from the prior year but more than doubled the consensus forecast of $0.19. Investors responded positively to signs that the company's strategy of closing underperforming stores is yielding results. Buoyed by the performance, Macy's lifted its full-year guidance for both revenue and adjusted earnings.\n\nIs now the time to buy Macy's? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nMacy\u2019s shares are quite volatile and have had 18 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for Macy's and indicate this news significantly impacted the market\u2019s perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock gained 3.4% on the news that fellow department store Kohl's reported a strong earnings beat, boosting sentiment across the retail sector. The positive results from a key competitor sparked investor optimism for peer companies. The move also comes as investors look ahead to Macy's own second-quarter results, which are scheduled for release next week. Analysts are focused on the potential impact of tariffs on the company's performance, which are expected to weigh on margins and reduce earnings per share for the fiscal year. However, some analysts also noted encouraging signs of consumer demand outpacing sentiment, particularly in areas with new product assortments and improved store offerings, providing a mixed but watchful outlook ahead of the report.\n\nMacy's is down 2.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $16.16 per share, it is trading 10.7% below its 52-week high of $18.10 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Macy\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,130.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.",

      "text": "Macy's (M)\nWe wouldn\u2019t buy Macy's. Not only are its sales cratering but also its low returns on capital suggest it struggles to generate profits.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Macy's Will Underperform\nWith a storied history that began with its 1858 founding, Macy\u2019s (NYSE:M) is a department store chain that sells clothing, cosmetics, accessories, and home goods.\n- Annual sales declines of 2% for the past six years show its products struggled to connect with the market\n- Sales are projected to tank by 4.3% over the next 12 months as its demand continues evaporating\n- Operating margin falls short of the industry average, and the smaller profit dollars make it harder to react to unexpected market developments\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Macy's\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Macy's\nMacy\u2019s stock price of $13.64 implies a valuation ratio of 7x forward P/E. Macy\u2019s valuation may seem like a bargain, but we think there are valid reasons why it\u2019s so cheap.\nOur advice is to pay up for elite businesses whose advantages are tailwinds to earnings growth. Don\u2019t get sucked into lower-quality businesses just because they seem like bargains. These mediocre businesses often never achieve a higher multiple as hoped, a phenomenon known as a \u201cvalue trap\u201d.\n3. Macy's (M) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nDepartment store chain Macy\u2019s (NYSE:M) reported revenue ahead of Wall Street\u2019s expectations in Q2 CY2025, but sales fell by 1.9% year on year to $5.00 billion. The company\u2019s full-year revenue guidance of $21.3 billion at the midpoint came in 0.6% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.41 per share was significantly above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nMacy's (M) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $5.00 billion vs analyst estimates of $4.87 billion (1.9% year-on-year decline, 2.7% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.41 vs analyst estimates of $0.19 (significant beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $393 million vs analyst estimates of $312.5 million (7.9% margin, 25.8% beat)\n- The company slightly lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $21.3 billion at the midpoint from $21.2 billion\n- Management raised its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance to $1.88 at the midpoint, a 4.2% increase\n- Operating Margin: 3%, down from 4.4% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow was $153 million, up from -$195 million in the same quarter last year\n- Same-Store Sales rose 1.9% year on year (-4% in the same quarter last year)\n- Market Capitalization: $3.66 billion\nCompany Overview\nWith a storied history that began with its 1858 founding, Macy\u2019s (NYSE:M) is a department store chain that sells clothing, cosmetics, accessories, and home goods.\nAs the name suggests, a department store offers a wide variety of merchandise organized into different departments or sections. Before the introduction of department stores in the 19th century, consumers would have to visit three different stores to buy a hat, a bottle of perfume, and pillows for their bedroom. While not the first department store, Macy\u2019s was a pioneer.\nToday, the core customer is a woman between the ages of 25 and 54 who is looking for name-brand products in a variety of categories. This customer can find prominent brands such as Calvin Klein, Levi\u2019s, MAC, Cuisinart, and Sony in a Macy\u2019s store or on its e-commerce site. Stores tend to be large, between 100,000 and 200,000 square feet, and serving as anchor tenants in many suburban malls. Common departments in a store include women\u2019s/men\u2019s/children\u2019s apparel, beauty/cosmetics, and home goods. Additionally, Macy's has an active e-commerce presence, launched in 1997 as one of the first major retailers to offer online purchases.\nSince the introduction of e-commerce, Macy\u2019s and peers have faced increased competition. Evolving specialty retailers and developments such as fast fashion have also pressured the department store model.\n4. Department Store\nDepartment stores emerged in the 19th century to provide customers with a wide variety of merchandise under one roof, offering a convenient and luxurious shopping experience. They played an important role in the history of American retail and urbanization, and prior to department stores, retailers tended to sell narrow specialty and niche items. But what was once new is now old, and department stores are somewhat considered a relic of the past. They are being attacked from multiple angles\u2013stagnant foot traffic at malls where they\u2019ve served as anchors; more nimble off-price and fast-fashion retailers; and e-commerce-first competitors not burdened by large physical footprints.\nDepartment or general merchandise retail competitors include Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), Kohl\u2019s (NYSE:KSS), and Dillard\u2019s (NYSE:DDS).\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul.\nWith $22.7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Macy's is one of the larger companies in the consumer retail industry and benefits from a well-known brand that influences purchasing decisions. However, its scale is a double-edged sword because it\u2019s harder to find incremental growth when you\u2019ve penetrated most of the market. To accelerate sales, Macy's likely needs to optimize its pricing or lean into international expansion.\nAs you can see below, Macy's struggled to generate demand over the last six years (we compare to 2019 to normalize for COVID-19 impacts). Its sales dropped by 2% annually as it closed stores and observed lower sales at existing, established locations.\nThis quarter, Macy\u2019s revenue fell by 1.9% year on year to $5.00 billion but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 2.7%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 4.6% over the next 12 months, a slight deceleration versus the last six years. This projection is underwhelming and indicates its products will see some demand headwinds.\n6. Store Performance\nNumber of Stores\nA retailer\u2019s store count often determines how much revenue it can generate.\nOver the last two years, Macy's has generally closed its stores, averaging 3.5% annual declines.\nWhen a retailer shutters stores, it usually means that brick-and-mortar demand is less than supply, and it is responding by closing underperforming locations to improve profitability.\nNote that Macy's reports its store count intermittently, so some data points are missing in the chart below.\nSame-Store Sales\nThe change in a company's store base only tells one side of the story. The other is the performance of its existing locations and e-commerce sales, which informs management teams whether they should expand or downsize their physical footprints. Same-store sales gives us insight into this topic because it measures organic growth for a retailer's e-commerce platform and brick-and-mortar shops that have existed for at least a year.\nMacy\u2019s demand has been shrinking over the last two years as its same-store sales have averaged 2.7% annual declines. This performance isn\u2019t ideal, and Macy's is attempting to boost same-store sales by closing stores (fewer locations sometimes lead to higher same-store sales).\nIn the latest quarter, Macy\u2019s same-store sales rose 1.9% year on year. This growth was a well-appreciated turnaround from its historical levels, showing the business is regaining momentum.\n7. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nGross profit margins are an important measure of a retailer\u2019s pricing power, product differentiation, and negotiating leverage.\nMacy's has good unit economics for a retailer, giving it the opportunity to invest in areas such as marketing and talent to stay competitive. As you can see below, it averaged an impressive 40.5% gross margin over the last two years. That means for every $100 in revenue, $59.49 went towards paying for inventory, transportation, and distribution.\nMacy's produced a 42% gross profit margin in Q2, in line with the same quarter last year and exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates by 5%. Zooming out, the company\u2019s full-year margin has remained steady over the past 12 months, suggesting it strives to keep prices low for customers and has stable input costs (such as labor and freight expenses to transport goods).\n8. Operating Margin\nMacy's was profitable over the last two years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 2.4% was weak for a consumer retail business. This result is surprising given its high gross margin as a starting point.\nOn the plus side, Macy\u2019s operating margin rose by 2.4 percentage points over the last year.\nIn Q2, Macy's generated an operating margin profit margin of 3%, down 1.4 percentage points year on year. Since Macy\u2019s operating margin decreased more than its gross margin, we can assume it was less efficient because expenses such as marketing, and administrative overhead increased.\n9. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nSadly for Macy's, its EPS declined by 7% annually over the last six years, more than its revenue. This tells us the company struggled because its fixed cost base made it difficult to adjust to shrinking demand.\nIn Q2, Macy's reported adjusted EPS of $0.41, down from $0.53 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Macy\u2019s full-year EPS of $2.41 to shrink by 25%.\n10. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nMacy's has shown mediocre cash profitability over the last two years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 2%, subpar for a consumer retail business.\nTaking a step back, an encouraging sign is that Macy\u2019s margin expanded by 1.3 percentage points over the last year. We have no doubt shareholders would like to continue seeing its cash conversion rise as it gives the company more optionality.\nMacy\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $153 million in Q2, equivalent to a 3.1% margin. Its cash flow turned positive after being negative in the same quarter last year, building on its favorable historical trend.\n11. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nMacy's historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 9.5%, somewhat low compared to the best consumer retail companies that consistently pump out 25%+.\n12. Balance Sheet Assessment\nMacy's reported $829 million of cash and $5.48 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $1.88 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Macy\u2019s 2.5\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $55 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n13. Key Takeaways from Macy\u2019s Q2 Results\nIt was good to see Macy's beat analysts\u2019 EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its full-year revenue and EPS guidance were both raised. Zooming out, we think this was a very solid print. The stock traded up 11.4% to $15.04 immediately after reporting.\n14. Is Now The Time To Buy Macy's?\nUpdated: September 3, 2025 at 7:07 AM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in Macy's.\nMacy's falls short of our quality standards. To kick things off, its revenue has declined over the last six years, and analysts expect its demand to deteriorate over the next 12 months. And while its popular brand gives it meaningful influence over consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions, the downside is its declining physical locations suggests its demand is falling. On top of that, its shrinking same-store sales tell us it will need to change its strategy to succeed.\nMacy\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 7.5x. While this valuation is optically cheap, the potential downside is huge given its shaky fundamentals. There are superior stocks to buy right now.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $13.46 on the company (compared to the current share price of $15.04), implying they don\u2019t see much short-term potential in Macy's."

      "text": "A Profitable Growth Stock Benefitting From The Rise of AI\nLattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ: LSCC) has long been one of the most exciting stocks on our watchlist because we think the company is benefitting from the rise of artificial intelligence.\nAs you can see from the chart below, the Lattice Semiconductor stock price dropped suddenly in October 2023. Just days later on 3 November 2023, we chose Lattice Semiconductor as the StockStory Edge stock of the month for November and emailed our detailed buy recommendation to members.\nAs our way of welcoming you aboard our free membership tier, we hope you enjoy this abridged version of our full recommendation, which is only available to members of StockStory Edge.\nWhat Does Lattice Semiconductor Do?\nLattice is a leading designer of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).\nField Programmable Gate Arrays, or FPGAs, are like a special kind of computer chip. You could think of them as like a LEGO set for building complex electronic systems. They are used for a variety of complex products like robots that work in distribution centers and cars with self-driving technology.\nNormally, computer chips are set to do one job and can't be changed. But FPGAs are different. After you buy them, you can change how they work to do different jobs. It's like having a LEGO set where you can first build a tiger, then take it apart and build a red panda, then take it apart and build a goldfish, all using the same pieces.\nFPGAs have emerged as a preferred solution for customers in rapidly evolving technological fields because their flexibility gives them significant cost and time advantages over legacy chips that can\u2019t be changed once manufactured. In AI research, for example, FPGAs\u2019 reprogrammable nature allows engineers to quickly change their algorithms without buying a new batch of chips that can cost millions of dollars.\nGiven its chips\u2019 customization abilities, Lattice collaborates intimately with customers to implement designs. The company achieves this through its team of field applications engineers and proprietary software solutions that allow for more user-friendly experiences. We like that it has a software solution because essential software can often earn very high profit margins.\nWe believe the demand for LSCC\u2019s FPGAs is durable. Its chips are critical components for dynamic, high-growth industries such as AI, industrial robotics, autonomous vehicles (i.e., self-driving technology), and 5G wireless infrastructure. We see a bigger role for these technologies in the future, and that means more demand for Lattice Semiconductor\u2019s products.\nRisks\nThe first risk is a potential semiconductor downturn. The industry is cyclical due to the interplay of global economic growth, inventories, and technological obsolescence. We believe Lattice is partially insulated from obsolescence because of the re-programmability of FPGAs, but there\u2019s no denying it\u2019s tethered to the macro, which is sometimes good, sometimes bad, and sometimes somewhere in between. Investing over the long term by holding high-quality companies over three to five years, however, can meaningfully negate this roller coaster.\nLike many semiconductor companies, Lattice is a \u201cfabless\u201d chip designer, meaning it doesn\u2019t manufacture, assemble, or test its chips in-house. Instead, it outsources these functions to partners like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) so that the company can focus on innovation. This means LSCC\u2019s supply chain could be disrupted if China blockaded Taiwan (or worse).\nFinally, there is competition. The company has a strong grip over the small-range FPGA market. The mid-range market is currently up for grabs, and we think Avant is a strong contender. On the other hand, AMD and Intel could also attack the mid-range market by providing customers with more tailored solutions. Thus far, the two giants have mostly set their sights on large-range FPGAs, which are mostly used for the highest-intensity applications.\nWhy We Like Lattice Semiconductors\nLattice is an exceptionally high-quality business and its best-in-class profit margins have always kept it near the top of our list. Semiconductors are cyclical businesses, so demand fluctuations are normal and temporary. We think Lattice can easily outlast any lulls in demand, thanks to strong free cash flow margins.\nOur view is that LSCC is the leader in a high-growth market, and its total addressable market is about to double.\n1. Lattice is benefitting from the rise of AI\nLattice is well-positioned to benefit from the rise of AI because its silicon is on almost every new AI server shipped globally today. That rate should increase as servers steadily consume more chips and the total number of servers grows with more businesses, organizations, and people using generative AI and large language models (like ChatGPT).\nAI will also bring an explosion in edge computing. Edge computing describes processing done on a server or device closer to the data source rather than in centralized data centers. Massive amounts of data must be analyzed at low latencies for AI to work at scale, and LSCC\u2019s FPGAs\u2013with their parallel processing capabilities that boost analytical speed and re-programmability that allows for easy adjustments to constantly changing AI algorithms\u2013are must-haves.\n2. Lattice has strong revenue and earnings per share growth\nLSCC is a 40-year-old company that has consistently done one thing well: designing FPGAs. Over the last five years, its revenue has grown from about $400 million to what will be $740+ million this year (13% annualized growth rate), and its EPS rose by almost 500% over the same period.\nAdditionally, Lattice\u2019s unique chips and intellectual property have enabled it to generate a robust 70% gross margin and 40% adjusted operating margin. This has led to heaps of free cash flow that the company has reinvested into product innovation. As of late, LSCC has even had excess cash to return to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. In 2022, it repurchased $110 million of stock, the highest annual total in its history.\n3. New Product Platform\nFor most of its history, LSCC has focused on the small-range, power-efficient FPGA market for applications requiring simple logic functions. The company\u2019s Nexus product line, released in late 2019, made Lattice the #1 player in the global FPGA market by volume. These chips were so popular because they featured the smallest chip sizes and lowest power consumption in the industry (75% less power consumption than comparable products from AMD and Intel).\nDespite its success, Lattice is not standing still. Less than a year ago, the company entered the mid-range FPGA market with its Avant product line. These chips are leveraged in more rigorous use cases requiring edge computing (the \u201cE\u201d in Avant-E, see below) such as industrial robotics, autonomous vehicle networking, and machine vision (using cameras and computers to inspect and measure).\nWe think Avant is a game-changing development because its FPGAs boast 2x the bandwidth capabilities, 2.5x better power efficiency, and are up to 6x smaller than competing products from AMD and Intel. They are simply superior products.\n4. Experienced Leadership\nLattice is led by CEO James Anderson, who joined the company in September 2018. Luckily for investors, his prior two roles were in key leadership positions at AMD and Intel. Anderson\u2019s hiring was part of the complete turnover of Lattice\u2019s old management team, and seven executives were recruited to join him.\nTwo individuals worth calling out are Stephen Douglass (Chief Technology Officer) and Mark Nelson (SVP of Sales). Douglass joined from Xilinx, which was the largest FPGA company before being acquired by AMD in 2022, while Nelson joined from Intel. We believe the management team\u2019s deep knowledge of the industry and its closest competitors gives it an advantage.\nSumming it all up, our research suggests that LSCC\u2019s $660 million of revenue in 2022 can nearly double to about $1.2 billion in five years, a 13% annualized growth rate. With higher margins from Avant sales, efficiency from selling to existing customers, and continued share buybacks, that revenue growth can translate into nearly 20% EPS growth per annum. We believe this kind of growth should see the stock will reach $90 by the end of 2026.\nWith a bit of luck\u2013and the optimism of a bull market\u2013shareholders may well see a higher price.\nIf you enjoyed this abridged version of our Stock of the Month for November 2023 you\u2019ll love the full version.

  "argos_summary": "Macy's shares surged 19.6% after reporting Q2 results that beat expectations, with same\u2011store sales up 1.9% YoY and a lift in full\u2011year revenue and earnings guidance. The retailer\u2019s strategy of closing underperforming stores appears to be paying off, driving investor optimism. Despite a 1.9% YoY revenue decline, adjusted earnings of $0.41 per share more than doubled analyst forecasts. The rally reflects a broader retail rebound and positive sentiment following a competitor\u2019s earnings beat.",
