  "title": "Is New York City Getting An Erewhon Grocery Store? Maybe.",
  "description": "Erewhon, a Los Angeles-based grocery store, is known for its super-expensive products and celebrity clientele.",
  "content": "Fieg, who created the streetwear brand Kith, this week shared a blueprint for one floor of the Kith Ivy/Padel 609 project he\u2019s spearheading at 609 Greenwich Street\u2014and it included a section labeled \u201cErewhon.\u201d The floorplan for part of the development, set to be a private club for the racket sport padel on three floors and the roof of the building, included space for a seating area, boutique, gym, locker rooms, sauna, steam room, hammam, cold plunge and an Erewhon, which would be the brand's first location outside of California. The space allocated to Erewhon in the plan doesn't look big enough for a full-service grocery store like the brand runs in Los Angeles, but the brand is most famous for its high-dollar smoothies (often created in collaboration with celebrities) and the construction management company behind the Kith Ivy project detail it as including a \u201cjuice bar.\u201d Neither Fieg nor Erewhon immediately responded to Forbes\u2019 request for comment on the project Tuesday.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines. Text \u201cAlerts\u201d to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nThe Erewhon brand started in the 1960s as a single health foods store in Boston but now operates solely in California, where it has 11 stores and is known as an organic luxury grocer famous for sky-high prices. In recent years, thanks to collaborations with stars like Hailey Bieber and Kendall Jenner (and, of course, social media) the brand has become a hotspot tourist destination synonymous with what the Los Angeles Times described as the \u201cshiny L.A. life.\u201d A \u201cguess the price\u201d game has b\n\ncome popular on TikTok and sees visitors will show a product on the grocery store shelf before revealing its price\u2014like $10 per pound for green bell peppers, $14 for a 25-ounce bottle of \u201chyper oxygenated\u201d water and $30 for eight \u201cluxury\u201d ice cubes. The store is popular with celebrities, and those spotted in the aisles have included Kylie Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, Machine Gun Kelly, Shawn Mendes and Matty Healy.\n\n$23. That\u2019s how much the \"Short N' Sweet\" smoothie, part of a collaboration with Sabrina Carpenter, cost at Erewhon stores last summer, one of the grocery store\u2019s most expensive smoothies ever offered. It was made with oat milk, mango, pineapple, dates, collagen, tocotrienols powder and a supplement called Agent Nateur Holi (mane), which sells for $99 per 10 ounces. The results of other popular collaborations have included Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s $18 Good 4 U smoothie, Kendall Jenner\u2019s $23 Peaches and Cream smoothie, and, most famously, Hailey Bieber\u2019s $17 Strawberry Skin Smoothie. At the height of their popularity in 2023, Erewhon reported selling 1,200 to 1,500 of Bieber\u2019s smoothie per day.",

      "text": "The Hollywood sign and \u2026 Erewhon? How the luxury grocery store became an L.A. tourist destination\n- Share via\n- Erewhon, home to Hailey Bieber smoothies and the backdrop of TikToks galore, also draws tourists curious about the spectacle.\n- The Beverly Hills location is a particular visitor hot spot.\n- Tourists come to buy smoothies and sushi that sometimes don\u2019t live up to the hype. And, yes, to post their reactions on TikTok and Instagram.\nWhen William Rath mapped out his post-law school trip to Los Angeles in May, his itinerary included the city\u2019s quintessential landmarks: gazing up at the Hollywood sign from Beachwood Canyon, taking a celebrity homes tour and scanning the Pacific Ocean for whales off the coast of Long Beach. But amid these classic stops, one destination rose above the rest. Erewhon, the luxury grocer, was a nonnegotiable \u2014 not for its groceries, but for the clout, the curiosity and the spectacle.\nRath, a freshly minted graduate from the University of Oregon and influencer, made his pilgrimage to the Beverly Hills location, the gleaming wellness emporium nestled just steps from Rodeo Drive, where Hailey Bieber\u2019s Strawberry Glaze Skin Smoothie routinely draws queues 20-people deep. Unable to find a seat outside, he retreated to his rental car in the shade of a nearby parking garage, and filmed a TikTok review.\n\u201cTikTok was the main reason I went. It\u2019s always been on my \u2018For You\u2019 page,\u201d says 25-year-old Rath. \u201cI always see a lot of influencers going there and trying different things. It\u2019s a big trend, and it hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d\nOnce the domain of wellness devotees and Hollywood insiders, Erewhon has transformed into something more universal: For some, it\u2019s their local grocery store, but it\u2019s also now a bucket list tourist destination. Like the Hollywood Walk of Fame or the Getty Museum, the upscale grocer draws out-of-town visitors in search of not just sustenance, but status \u2014 a smoothie, a snapshot and social media proof they were there.\nAspiration defines much of Erewhon\u2019s appeal. In an era when tourists seek experiences as much as landmarks, the store offers something singular: a way to sample a certain kind of shiny L.A. life. It\u2019s wellness as entertainment, grocery shopping as status symbol. Some tourists are just people on vacation there to gawk, while others are influencers there for content.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cultural moment,\u201d says Christina Basias, 36, who has checked out Erewhon\u2019s Santa Monica, Venice and Silver Lake locations when traveling from New Jersey with wife Alexis Androulakis, 38. When they go, the beauty product educators and entrepreneurs scope out new product trends and wellness ingredients that haven\u2019t yet hit mass retailers. \u201cAt least 40% of what I see at Erewhon, I can\u2019t find anywhere else,\u201d Androulakis adds.\nWhat started as a bit has turned the Los Feliz Albertsons into the focus of a beloved neighborhood meme account. How earnest is it? Even the creators can\u2019t say.\nFounded in 1966 by macrobiotic pioneers Michio and Aveline Kushi, Erewhon began as a natural foods stall in a Boston market before opening a location in L.A. in 1969. The pair borrowed the store\u2019s name, an anagram of \u201cnowhere,\u201d from Samuel Butler\u2019s 1872 satirical novel of the same name, which centered on a utopia where illness is considered a crime. After Tony Antoci and wife Josephine acquired the brand in 2011, the stores became sleeker and more light-filled; valet parking became the norm. Perhaps most significantly, Erewhon began partnering with celebrities on exclusive smoothie collaborations with none more iconic than Hailey Bieber\u2019s Strawberry Glaze Skin Smoothie.\nBy mastering the intersection of curated wellness and celebrity cachet, the brand has turned everyday shopping into a kind of luxury theater.\nFor many first-time visitors, going to the store is driven by seeing the phenomenon for themselves. That was the appeal for Chloe Forero, an influencer from Chicago, who visited L.A. in May. \u201cIt was very much a Whole Foods on steroids,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just seemed more like a social experiment than a place people shop day to day.\u201d\nForero, 22, walked away with a sushi roll, two juices and a cookie totaling $65. \u201cThe cookie was great,\u201d she admits. \u201cBut I ate that sushi thinking maybe this will change my life. Perhaps this sushi will be so good it\u2019ll be worth the price tag that comes with it. It was not.\u201d\nNowhere but the L.A. Times will you find smoothie content like this. Nowhere!\nSome longtime Erewhon shoppers \u2014 yes, some of whom are influencers themselves \u2014 grumble on social media about the Erewhon tourists. Meredith Lynch, a Los Angeles native, writer and influencer who frequently dissects influencer culture online, says the Beverly Hills location, in particular, has become a stage. \u201cSo much about L.A., for better or worse, is about being seen,\u201d she says. \u201cErewhon is a place where people go, and they get seen.\u201d\nThe performative aspect resonates with young out-of-towners. Kiara Dewrance, a chef from Cape Town, South Africa, had hoped to try the Bieber smoothie when she visited L.A. last September. But after seeing the price ($20), she opted for two less expensive drinks and still walked away thrilled.\n\u201cIt kind of feels like when you\u2019re watching a movie. It kind of felt like a movie moment seeing it in real life,\u201d says Dewrance, 27.\nGibson Ardoline, a 19-year-old influencer and business administration major at the University of Florida, spent $91 on lunch when he first toured L.A. last November, which included sushi, juice and one of the store\u2019s hot bar meals. He offset the costs by filming two TikTok reels chronicling his experience, which received more than 1 million views combined and earned him more than what he spent at Erewhon thanks to payments from TikTok as part of the platform\u2019s Creator Rewards Program.\n\u201cIt was worth going one time, just to have the laugh and say I spent $90 on lunch,\u201d he says, although he wouldn\u2019t disclose how much he made. \u201cIt might not be a laugh for everybody, but to me, it was profitable.\u201d\nA new category of beverages advertises so-called adaptogens, ingredients that companies claim can help you manage stress, enhance creativity and sharpen focus. Is that true?\nNot everyone leaves ambivalent. Patrick Oatman, a model and economics major at the University of Connecticut, was genuinely impressed when he dropped by Erewhon last June.\n\u201cIt seemed to be miles away from a regular grocery store, so it was entertaining in that perspective. It felt like this out-of-reach L.A. thing,\u201d says Oatman, 21.\nFor Rath, who hopes to move to L.A. and practice entertainment law one day, his $100 tab was less a trip expense than a rite of passage.\n\u201cThis couldn\u2019t be my weekly place for groceries, but If I had a job in L.A., maybe I would go, although it would have to be like once every two weeks,\u201d he explains.\nWhen asked to rank Erewhon among the other iconic spots he visited, he didn\u2019t skip a beat.\n\u201cHonestly?\u201d he says. \u201cIn-N-Out was fine, but I preferred Erewhon.\u201d"

      "text": "Performance-oriented beverage startup, Barcode, has closed $2.2 million in its latest funding round led by a group of institutions, celebrities and athletes after the company secured listings at Erewhon Market and 10 Central Market locations across Texas.\nThe investment, which adds to Barcode\u2019s previous $1 million raise, is expected to help the company accelerate its already double-digit annual growth momentum through product innovation and marketing, and further strengthen footprint in the U.S. natural channel, according to founder and CEO Mubarak Malik.\nBarcode\u2019s latest investors include Trousdale Ventures, Midnight Venture Partners, Cathexis Ventures, Silas Capital, Gaingels, Erewhon Market, as well as music recording artist and TV producer Kelly Rowland, and NBA Basketball player Maurice Harkless.\nMalik, who has trained NBA players for New York Knicks and LA Lakers prior to launching Barcode, said these \u201chighly selected\u201d investors are experienced in scaling CPG especially high-growth beverage brands from zero to $10 million in sales.\n\u201cErewhon firmly supports Barcode as a top-performing sports drink in our seven stores across Los Angeles,\u201d said Vito Antoci, VP of Erewhon Market. \u201cWe believe in better-for-you alternatives in the ready-to-drink category that naturally make a difference in the way you feel.\u201d\nMs. Rowland also said she believes in the uniqueness of Barcode and will support the company\u2019s retail expansion in the future. \u201cWhen I met Bar, I was inspired by his enthusiasm and I loved the drink,\u201d noted Ms. Rowland in a statement. \u201cI invested in this company because I believe in the team behind it... I haven't seen anything like Barcode that is great for athletes and anyone on the move.\u201d\nPlant-Based Nutrition And Interactive Packaging\nBarcode\u2019s story started on the basketball court: about a decade ago, Malik began formulating his own sports drink after noticing the multivitamins NBA players usually take were obsolete from traditional hydration products that have largely relied on electrolytes and sugar to provide energy for their consumers.\nBut the true pillars of athletic wellness, Malik explained, consists of \u201crecovery, immunity, hydration, and mental strength\u201d which require vitamin B6, B12, magnesium, Vitamin D, coconut water, and adaptogens.\nSweetened with monk fruit, each of Barcode\u2019s three varieties, lemon lime, watermelon, and pinot noir, contains 2g of natural sugar from coconut water, 30 calories, 50% less sodium than Gatorade, and ashwagandha \u2014 a type of adaptogens that\u2019s gained increasing popularity among mental, brain health-focused products, such as MOSH.\nAll these ingredients and nutritional value appear when shoppers scan the barcode through customized AR lenses saved on Barcode\u2019s Instagram page instead of printed directly on the bottle, a minimalistic design that intends to stand out on shelf while creating more consumer interactions as a digitally native brand.\n\u201cThat was the idea behind branding: the barcode acts as our logo, and we\u2019re able to add filters to it because it\u2019s an active UPC,\u201d Malik said. \u201cIt's all about content and community, and we\u2019re a step ahead using the barcode and technology.\u201d\nIncreasing Deal Flow In Functional Beverages\nBarcode\u2019s latest fundraise comes amid growing investor interest in the fast-growing functional drinks sector, where Gatorade remains as an incumbent with more than 70% market share.\nIt\u2019s been nothing but short of funding in the sector as PitchBook showed there more than 30 transactions in the category globally over the past five years, most notably Coca-Cola\u2019s $5.6 billion acquisition of Bodyarmor in 2021 and Unilever\u2019s acquisition of Liquid I.V. in the prior year. SOS Hydration has also filed to go public on Nasdaq after reportedly raising $2.79 million in VC money to date.\nEmerging brands, such as Hydrant, The Plug Drink, Waterdrop, and Beam, have also closed significant funding recently, a nod to the prospective growth of the market.\nBut Barcode promises to remain in the ready-to-drink arena. \u201cI want Barcode to be an iconic brand,\u201d said Malik, \u201cone that was born in NBA with athletes, and take over the natural channel, where a hybrid of sports drink and premium hydration was never available.\u201d"

      "text": "In Erewhon, Samuel Butler\u2019s 1872 novel, illness is punished like a crime. In Erewhon, the luxury Los Angeles grocery store, health is wealth\u2014its price tag ostensibly the measure of its virtue. The novel was a satire. The store, with its $22 smoothies and individually wrapped $19 strawberries, is something else entirely\u2014though it\u2019s difficult to say what. A business? A lifestyle? A satire of its very own?\nWhat\u2019s clear is that Erewhon (the store) has achieved a cultural cachet that few grocery chains could dream of. Less a supermarket than a sanctum, it operates on the principle that purity\u2014of ingredients, of body, of mind\u2014is the highest virtue. To enter an Erewhon is to move through a space where every purchase signals a kind of moral choice: biodynamic or conventional? Raw dairy or pasteurized? Cold plunge or cryotherapy? Here, health is not just an aspiration but a performance, and the price of admission is steep.\nA Business Model Built on Aspiration\nErewhon\u2019s origins are far humbler than its clientele. Founded in 1966 by Michio and Aveline Kushi, pioneers of the macrobiotic movement, the original Erewhon was a Boston-based health food store dedicated to organic, unprocessed ingredients. It was niche, almost ascetic\u2014an embodiment of countercultural values. By the time Erewhon moved to Los Angeles, its ethos had begun to shift. Wellness had become an industry, and Erewhon adapted accordingly.\nToday, Erewhon operates ten locations across Los Angeles County, each more akin to a high-end boutique than a traditional grocer. The stores are meticulously curated, their shelves stocked with everything from imported Japanese strawberries ($19 each) to custom celebrity smoothies ($17 and up). The branding is pristine, the lighting immaculate. If Whole Foods was once jokingly referred to as \u201cWhole Paycheck,\u201d Erewhon has refined the concept: here, a single grocery trip can easily exceed $300.\nAnd yet, business is booming. In 2023, Erewhon reportedly generated $171.4 million in profit, an extraordinary feat for a company with so few locations. The secret? Exclusivity. Erewhon doesn\u2019t just sell food; it sells access\u2014to a lifestyle, a community, an aesthetic. Its success hinges on the same principle that underlies luxury fashion: if the price tag is high enough, people will buy it for the status alone.\nThe Morality of Wellness\nErewhon is ideological. Its shelves reflect a vision of health that is uncompromising, almost dogmatic. Dairy is raw. Meat is grass-fed. Supplements are abundant. Every item is designed to reassure the consumer that they are making the right choice, that they are optimizing, cleansing, healing. The unspoken implication: failure to adhere to these principles is not just a lapse in dietary discipline but a moral failing.\nThis, of course, is where the echoes of Butler\u2019s Erewhon become almost too on-the-nose. In the novel, the Erewhonians punish illness as if it were a crime, treating the unwell as social pariahs. In the grocery store, the logic is subtler but no less insidious. The underlying message is clear: sickness is negligence. With the right adaptogens, the right probiotics, the right smoothie blend, wellness is yours. Therefore, if you are unwell, you simply haven\u2019t tried hard enough\u2014or spent enough.\nCelebrity Endorsements and the Performance of Health\nErewhon\u2019s ability to fuse commerce with culture is nowhere more evident than in its celebrity partnerships. The Hailey Bieber \u201cStrawberry Glaze Skin Smoothie\u201d ($17) became a viral sensation, cementing Erewhon as the go-to grocery store for the ultra-visible and ultra-aspirational. Bella Hadid, Kim Kardashian, and Jake Gyllenhaal have all been spotted browsing its aisles, reusable tote bags in hand.\nThis is wellness as spectacle. Buying a $20 smoothie at Erewhon is not just about consuming nutrients, but about being seen consuming nutrients. The store thrives on its Instagramability, its ability to signal a certain kind of self-care; one that is expensive, meticulous, and deeply aestheticized. It is not enough to be healthy. oOne must curate their health, aligning it with the latest trends, the most exclusive ingredients.\nIt would be tempting to call Erewhon an elaborate joke\u2014a living satire of the wellness industry\u2019s extremes. But satire requires intent, and Erewhon is entirely earnest in its mission. It is not mocking the commodification of health, butperfecting it. If Butler\u2019s Erewhon was a warning, Erewhon the store is its fulfilment\u2014a world where wellness is not a right but a privilege, where the pursuit of health has become indistinguishable from the pursuit of status.\nAnd perhaps that is what makes it so unsettling. Not that Erewhon exists, but that it thrives. That we have built a society where selling a $19 strawberry is not just possible, but desirable. That the high cost of wellness is no longer questioned but accepted. That we have, in effect, stepped into Butler\u2019s world\u2014only without realizing that we were supposed to be laughing."

      "text": "Last week, Sabrina Carpenterannounced her collaboration with Erewhon \u2014 an uber-bougie, celeb-frequented grocery chain in LA \u2014 on a Short n' Sweet smoothie inspired by her upcoming album of the same name.\nAs an Angelino rite of passage, I, too, have made the trek to an Erewhon to gawk at the wildly high price of their pasta sauce and try one of their $17 smoothies, which \u2014 in an unfortunate turn of events for my wallet \u2014 was very tasty. So, as a longtime Sabrina fan (justice for EVOLution!!!) and chronically nosy person, when I saw Sabrina's Instagram post about her collaboration, I knew I needed to try it. For science, obviously.\nAt first glance, the Short n' Sweet smoothie isn't all that fancy. It's got tropical fruit, vanilla oat milk, honey, layers of coconut cream, and is made bright blue thanks to blue spirulina powder. Part of where it gets its $23 price tag, though, is from the Agent Nateur Holi (mane), which is a hair, nail, and skin supplement that combines marine collagen and crushed pearl powder. One 10.6-oz bag of the stuff costs $99.\nWill one of these smoothies give me Sabrina's luscious locks or glowy skin? Probably not, but I wanted to try it anyway to see if it was tasty enough to justify spending half my weekly grocery budget on a singular drink.\nWhen I got to Erewhon, the tonic bar line was looooong. Most of the people in front of me also ordered smoothies, and I'd say at least 80% of them were the aforementioned Strawberry Skin Smoothie, which was so popular that it was seemingly one person's job to make batch after batch of them. I did see a few fellow Carpenters toting their bright blue beverages, though. The crew at the store I went to was absolutely killer, and despite the line, everything moved pretty quickly, and within a handful of minutes, mine was ready. Here she is, in all her glory!\nTopped with coconut cream, sliced strawberries, and honey, it visually has very much the same vibe as the Short n' Sweet album cover. It's giving summer! It's beachy! And, after a few sips, the blue and white start to blend together and look like waves crashing onto the shore. So, five stars for aesthetics here, I can practically hear \"Espresso\" playing in my head every time I take a sip.\nAnd now, for the taste test. The smoothie was super thick \u2014 almost like a milkshake in texture \u2014 and a tad bit chalky. Ignoring what I know about the ingredients, if you asked me to guess what was in it based solely on taste, I'd definitely be able to tell it was coconut and mango, but the rest of the flavors more or less blended together. Overall, it tasted like a healthier, mango-forward version of a pi\u00f1a colada with a hint of vanilla. Not the sweet, dessert-y kind of vanilla, but more of an understated, almost graham cracker-like flavor. I thought it tasted a bit like a fruity, sugar-free funfetti cake, and my girlfriend compared it to a strawberry angel food cake. It was very much giving \"drink you'd order at the beach on vacation.\"\nThe coconut cream layer in the middle was light and fluffy, and a really nice contrast to how thick the smoothie was. It kinda felt like sipping on a cloud, and I will absolutely be stealing the idea for any future smoothies I make. The leftover strawberries and cream they topped the drink off with were a little hard to eat at the end without getting smoothie residue all over your hands/nose/etc., but it was actually a refreshing finale to the drink that I really enjoyed.\nOverall, I really enjoyed it and was impressed by how perfectly it fit into the Short n' Sweet album's vibe and aesthetic. This isn't my first taste test of a celebrity's food collaboration project by any means, and oftentimes, I find them pretty disappointing. You can tell when a celeb just slaps their name on a product for the paycheck, and while I'm all for getting your bag, where's the fun? Make it themed! Make it a moment! Make the collaboration actually make sense as a thing that needs to exist! All that being said, I wanna give Sabrina and her team their flowers for making this fun and something that actually feels relevant to her brand and album. I could 100% see her tanning and sipping on this in the \"Espresso\" music video, and I love it!\nWas it good? Yeah, I'd say so. I really liked it, and it was definitely fun to try once (and big enough to split with a friend if you're a Carpenter on a budget!). Was it worth the $23, though? Ehh, I'm not so sure. I personally am not in a rush to get another one. If the price was a little less steep, I might go back on a hot summer day and get one as a treat, but in this economy, I can think of a lot of better ways to spend 20 bucks. And, unfortunately, I am here to report that I did not get Sabrina's super thick hair from one singular smoothie, nor did the pearl powder cure all my skin problems. Tragic!\nHave you tried it yourself? Would you spend $23 on a celebrity smoothie? Tell us your thoughts in the comments below!"

      "text": "If you\u2019ve noticed a proliferation of beauty and lifestyle brands creating smoothies \u2014 and going viral \u2014 then join the club.\nWhile smoothie collabs are an entire product category on their own, brands have long been partnering with iconic foods to create limited-edition signature flavors and products.\nPairing a food and beverage companies with a celebrity, or a fashion, beauty or lifestyle brand can be a successful way to tap into a whole new audience and ignite some buzz.\nWhen it comes to predicting the formula for a viral drink, the equation seems straightforward, doesn\u2019t it?\n1- Align with a noteworthy, popular founder, creator or brand.\n2- Create a flavor profile that\u2019s both delicious and highly Instagrammable.\n3- Offer the drink for a limited time (this isn\u2019t always the case but urgency is often part of the mix).\nAnd yet, only a select few have cracked the code for smoothie collab success. That\u2019s because there\u2019s no true copy-paste template for this type of branded liquid gold.\nI spoke with three brand founders who have mastered this, as well as branding and marketing experts who have harnessed the power of virality.\nThere\u2019s no question about it: Erewhon, the Los Angeles-based certified organic retailer (that also has B Corp Certification), helped unlock a new level of stratospheric success with its smoothies.\nMarianna Hewitt and Hailey Bieber are the two influencers and beauty founders who helped propel this trend at Erewhon in 2022 \u2014 starting with Hewitt\u2019s \"Coconut Cloud\u201d in March, followed by the release of Bieber\u2019s \"Strawberry Glaze Skin\u201d smoothie (dubbed the \u201cHailey Bieber\u201d), soon after in June.\nAccording to Vito Antoci, Erewhon Executive Vice President (who has been named among Glossy\u2019s \u201cTop Marketers of 2023\u201d), Marianna Hewitt\u2019s \u201cCoconut Cloud\u201d is what changed it all for Erewhon and showcased the endless possibilities within this new product category.\nBieber is currently making waves with the late August launch of Rhode\u2019s newest Peptide Lip Treatment, which bears the same lip-smacking name as the infamous and still extremely viral Erewhon smoothie.\nBieber\u2019s \u201cStrawberry Glaze Skin\u201d smoothie is still going extremely strong: \u201cIn Hailey's first month, she sold about 36,000 smoothies,\u201d Antoci shares. \u201cWe had our biggest month ever this past August \u2014 we saw a spike of 16,000 units.\u201d\nAccording to Antoci, 1,200 to 1,500 of Bieber\u2019s \u201cStrawberry Glaze Skin\u201d smoothie are sold at Erewhon, per day. Sales and social media posts of the drink were even boosted in August, which Antoci attributes to Taylor Swift\u2019s L.A. stop of The Eras tour: that week led to a significant spike in sales, as concertgoers visiting Los Angeles wanted to get in on the \u201cStrawberry Glaze Skin Smoothie\u201d phenomenon (and share about it on social).\nWith the belief that brands can have a positive impact on their community, Rhode built the Rhode Futures Foundation as part of the brand's DNA since day one. Partial proceeds of the $18 smoothie went to the brand\u2019s Rhode Foundation.\n(All of Erewhon\u2019s smoothies have a give-back component, with proceeds going to the creator\u2019s non-profit organization of choice.)\nOn the opposite side of the food spectrum as Erewhon, Krispy Kreme temporarily reintroduced its Strawberry Glaze donut, until September 4. So now fans of Rhode\u2019s Strawberry Glaze Skin Smoothie can have their proverbial cake \u2014 and donuts too.\n(It\u2019s safe to assume that Erewhon\u2019s target consumer is sipping its way to Strawberry Glaze Skin, as Bieber hinted that it\u2019s a \u201cStrawberry Girl Summer,\u201d but the beauty of unpredictable branding makes the Krispy Kreme tie-in that much more compelling.)\nSummer Fridays founder Marianna Hewitt has since launched a follow-up smoothie at Erewhon: this summer\u2019s \"Strawberry Lemonade Summer Crush.\"\nFlavor and aesthetics are two benchmarks of a standout smoothie, so when it comes to creating the look, let your brand\u2019s image take the lead.\n\u201cI am someone who thinks social and digitally first to get people excited, so I knew I wanted it to be visually beautiful, featuring a nod to Summer Fridays with a shade of blue,\u201d Hewitt says about her \u201cCoconut Cloud\u201d smoothie. \u201cBut it had to taste good in addition to being beautiful, so together with the Erewhon team, we created this drink.\u201d\n\u201cWe like to tie it into something that\u2019s natural to the brand \u2014 with \u2018Coconut Cloud\u2019 it was the blue color of Jet Lag Mask, and with \u2018Strawberry Lemonade\u2019, it\u2019s the name \u2018Summer Crush\u2019 that ties into the brand name and feeling of Summer Fridays. We were also able to do a sample with purchase of our ShadeDrops Mineral Milk Sunscreen, so we could reach a new audience with our products.\u201d\nFor \"Strawberry Lemonade Summer Crush,\u201d lemonade-flavored electrolytes were added to the drink for hydration, to bring in the functional aspect of the drink.\nWhen it comes to Erewhon smoothies, flavor and look aren\u2019t enough \u2014 a functional element must be part of the equation.\nThis past June, the retailer collaborated with gut health brand Arrae to create its signature \u201cCocojito\u201d smoothie.\n\u201cWe had done a big retail display partnership with Erewhon last year, and then again this year, and both went really well,\u201d Arrae founder Siffat Haider explains. \u201cErewhon customers are our target demo, and we had substantial data to back up the fact that a smoothie partnership with them would be a smart marketing decision.\u201d\nThe \u201cCocojito\u201d smoothie, which doubles as a debloating drink, contains the formula of its bestselling Bloat product, in addition to vanilla collagen.\nViral smoothie collaborations aren\u2019t limited to beauty and wellness brands: entrepreneur, confidence coach and media personality, Serena Kerrigan, co-created a shake with global coffee and juice brand Joe & the Juice, called \u201cFor The Plot\u201d \u2014 a tribute to her signature tagline. Kerrigan\u2019s drink is available at all Joe & the Juice locations across the U.S., until Labor Day.\nKerrigan\u2019s \u201cdo it for the plot\u201d motto has inspired thousands of people to live life genuinely and unapologetically.\n\u201cThis collab with Joe & the Juice felt like the perfect next step for me because it fits right in with my target audience, while being widely accessible to many who might not be familiar with my brand,\u201d Kerrigan shares.\n\u201cThe most important element executives should narrow in on when looking for talent to collaborate with, is finding someone who has a unique story to tell. I wasn\u2019t selling a shake with this collab \u2014 I was selling a feeling. It's an everyday reminder to embrace yourself as the main character, and do it for the plot of your life. Empowerment is truly at the center of this marketing campaign and I believe embracing yourself sends a very powerful message. Brands should look for talent with loyal communities and a strong POV.\u201d\nAntoci agrees with this thought: \u201cWe do not do smoothies with brands, we do smoothies with celebrities. Celebrity influencer smoothies are 100% our biggest viral moment.\u201d\nThe plot thickens: According to Joe & the Juice, the out-of-home advertising in Soho drew a combined total of 70M monthly average views. The campaign images were seen on a billboard, through wild postings and sidewalk stencils. On the social front, the collaboration amassed more than 1.3 million views on TikTok. The 'For The Plot' shake sales propelled a 5% increase in sales within the first month and attracted over 10,000 new customers to Joe & the Juice. Over 15,000 of Kerrigan\u2019s shakes have been sold and to no one\u2019s surprise, New York, Kerrigan\u2019s home state, emerged as the top selling state.\nJuliana Goldman, founder of Potion and the agency of record for Joe & the Juice, shared her thoughts on the magic of collaborations.\n\u201cCo-creating a product is a powerful marketing play that extends beyond the beverage space and holds incredible value. It can significantly boost customer engagement, facilitate personalized experiences, generates a ton of buzz, and promotes advocacy. Brands embracing co-creation are positioning themselves for future success. Today, customers seek more than just products \u2014 they crave experiences and purpose-driven interactions with the brands they support.\u201d\nHaider of Arrae adds: \u201cI see it as a brand awareness and marketing play. If you're concerned about ROI, know that it probably won't be instant, but rather a trickle-down effect.\u201d\nThose who launch a smoothie or collab with a food and beverage brand have hopes for going viral \u2014 but unlike the drinks themselves, virality cannot be bottled.\nAdee Drexler, founder and CEO of Infinity Creative Agency (a.k.a. ICA), is the mastermind behind one of this year\u2019s most viral moment: Sofia Richie Grainge\u2019s TikTok debut right before her wedding.\nDrexler shares her thoughts on going viral: \u201cVirality can\u2019t be forced. It\u2019s more about having a perfect storm of several factors, all happening at the same time. Timing, relevance, a sense of effortless execution, and some luck all come into play. And if you\u2019re trying to make something go viral, people can sense that you\u2019re trying too hard, which can come off as inauthentic and performative. You can\u2019t orchestrate it.\u201d\nWhen it comes to hoping for virality, Antoci is aligned \u2014 it\u2019s not something you can ever project or predict. \u201cI think it\u2019s much better when you try things for fun. At Erewhon, we launched these smoothies and drinks for fun \u2014 it has to be very organic and it has to feel very right to our audience first. And then everything else comes with it. That's been the magic of it.\u201d"
