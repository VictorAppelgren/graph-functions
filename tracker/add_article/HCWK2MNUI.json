      "title": "After Repeated Explosions, New Test For Musk's Megarocket",
      "summary": "SpaceX plans to launch its Starship megarocket on August 24 for its 10th test flight after a series of fiery explosions that damaged the vehicle and caused debris to fall over the Caribbean. The 403‑foot rocket, designed to be fully reusable, has suffered multiple upper‑stage failures, including a fuel‑leak‑induced loss of control in May and a ground‑test blast in June. Elon Musk insists the vehicle will soon carry uncrewed missions to Mars, while the company faces criticism from Mexican officials over debris and environmental impacts. The U.S. aviation regulator has approved an increase in annual launches from five to 25, signaling continued testing despite setbacks.",
