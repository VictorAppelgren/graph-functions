  "description": "Ethan Guo, an American teen pilot and influencer agreed to a deal with Chilean prosecutors after an unauthorized landing on their territory.",
  "content": "An American pilot and influencer who has been stuck on Chilean territory in Antarctica agreed to a deal that would see him make a large donation to avoid a trial on charges connected to landing on the continent, according to American and Chilean reporting.\n\nA Chilean court suspended proceedings against Ethan Guo, a teen influencer who intended to fly to all seven continents to fundraise for children's cancer research on Monday, Aug. 11, according to Chilean newspaper La Tercera.\n\nChilean prosecutors alleged that the influencer had provided authorities with false flight plan data and \"multiple national and international\" rules regarding access to Antarctica, according to CBS News.\n\nGuo must make a $30,000 donation to Fundacio\u0301n Nuestros Hijos within 30 days and agree to be banned from Chilean territory for three years, according to La Trecera. Chilean television station 24Horas reported that the donation must be paid within 72 hours of Guo's return to continental Chile and that he must cover the cost of his plane's stay at a Chilean military base in Antarctica.\n\nHe told the Associated Press that he was \"relieved by the outcome\" following the ruling.\n\n\"I remain in Antarctica awaiting approval for my departure flight,\" Guo told the wire service through text messages Aug. 11. \"I sincerely hope they give it to me soon so that I and my plane can continue with my original mission.\"\n\nGuo confirmed he remained on Antarctica in messages with USA TODAY through his Instagram account Aug. 12. A timetable for his return to mainland Chile is unclear, Guo said.\n\nWhy was Ethan Guo on Antarctica?\n\nGuo began a \"trip around the world\" in Sept. 2024 to raise $1 million for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and documented the trip on his Instagram page.\n\nHe had reached six of the seven continents in his Cessna 182Q before flying to Antarctica.\n\nHe flew to King George Island, an island off the coast of Antarctica that Chile claims as its territory, on June 28 and was detained at the airport there, according to CBS News.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Guo was cleared to fly to Punta Arenas but not continue onto the island, according to La Tercera.\n\nThe newspaper reported that Guo's defense filed a letter pointing to WhatsApp communications between Guo and officials at the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, where a \"senior DGAC official expressly responds to Ethan Guo that he can land\" at the airport on King George Island for \"safety reasons.\"\n\n\u201cWhile already in the air, he began to experience a series of complications,\u201d Karina Ulloa, one of Guo's lawyers, told CNN. She added that Guo was on an exploratory flight to ensure the ability to fly the route.\n\nLa Tercera quoted another of Guo's lawyers, Jaime Barrentos, as saying, \"the prosecutor's office made decisions with partial information provided by DGAC.\"\n\nGuo said hardest part of flying is 'paperwork'\n\nIn a profile before the flight with The Patriot Ledger \u2013 a part of the USA TODAY Network \u2013 the Milton, Massachusetts native foreshadowed the logistical roadblocks he would encounter.\n\n\u201cFlying isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s harder than driving a car, but the hardest part is the logistics and paperwork,\" said Guo, who told the paper that he would be submitting the necessary permits and documents for each country on the flight.\n\nGuo began flying at 13 and already holds a record as the youngest person to fly to all 48 contiguous states, a feat he accomplished at 17, not long after earning his pilot's license.\n\nGuo had attempted the flight around the world in 2023 in the additional hope of becoming the youngest person to complete the global trek. That journey, though, was grounded before it started.\n\nOn his approach to the Memphis airport in September 2023, his plane encountered a partial power failure at 12,000 feet.",

      "text": "U.S. teen influencer still stranded in Antarctic weeks after landing plane without permission\nWhat was intended as a fundraising mission has become a nightmare for American teen influencer Ethan Guo, who has been stuck in a remote location in Chilean territory in Antarctica since June.\nLast year, Guo began a journey to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents. The trip also aimed to raise $1 million for childhood cancer research through St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Guo flew his Cessna 182Q to North America, South America, Asia, Africa, Australia and Europe before heading to Antarctica.\nProsecutors said he was authorized to fly to the Chilean city of Punta Arenas, which is often used as a base for excursions to Antarctica. Authorities said Guo provided \"false flight plan data\" and traveled to King George Island. Guo's flight plan only included his landing in Punta Arenas, authorities said. Chile claims ownership of the island, which is about 75 miles off the coast of Antarctica.\nGuo was detained at the airport on King George Island. On June 29, he was charged with handing false information to ground control and landing without authorization, both breaches of the Chilean Aeronautical Code. The code calls for short-term imprisonment or a fine for anyone who lands on the country's territory without authorization.\nChilean prosecutor Cristi\u00e1n Cristoso also said that Guo violated \"multiple national and international\" rules governing access to Antarctica and the routes used to travel there. The unauthorized flight posed safety risks for other air travelers, Cristoso said.\nSince being charged, Guo has stayed at a military base on the island. He was not forced to stay there, only to remain in Chilean territory, but because of the severe winter in that part of the southern hemisphere, there haven't been any available flights he could take.\nGuo was also unable to fly his Cessna. Cristoso told reporters on Monday that Guo's plane \"does not have the capabilities to make a flight,\" but did not provide more details.\nOn Monday, a judge dropped the charges against Guo as part of an agreement with his lawyers and Chilean prosecutors. The agreement requires Guo make a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer foundation within 30 days to avoid a trial. He must also leave Chile as soon as conditions allow, and is prohibited from reentering Chilean territory for three years.\nThe prosecutor's office said Guo must also pay all costs for his \"aircraft security and personal maintenance\" during his stay at the military facility. He also needs to cover all expenses for his return.\nGuo told The Associated Press in a text that he was \"relieved by the outcome.\"\nGuo said he is awaiting approval for his departure flight from Antarctica. He is talking with his lawyer to see if there is any way he can continue to fly his Cessna, and said he hopes he can continue with his \"original mission.\""

      "text": "Massachusetts native, 18, plans to fly around world \u2212 by himself\nNORWOOD \u2013 Ethan Guo hopes he'll be far, far from home this time next week.\nThe 18-year-old Milton native, who has been living in Florida the last few years, will spend the next three or so months crossing the globe in his small Cessna plane.\nHe is back in Massachusetts and staying with a friend, since most of his support team is located here, he said.\n\"More people have been in space than have flown around the world,\" he said while working on his plane on a sunny Friday at Norwood Memorial Airport in preparation for his departure on Saturday, May 11.\nFly, fly again\nGuo attempted the flight last year in the additional hope of becoming the youngest person to complete the global trek. That journey, though, was grounded before it started.\nHe had planned to launch his trip from Memphis, Tennessee, where St. Jude\u2019s is headquartered. He hopes his journey will raise $1 million and awareness for St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital through his \"Flight Against Cancer.\"\nBut on his approach to the airport in Memphis in September 2023, his plane encountered a partial power failure at 12,000 feet. When he safely landed, he said he knew his engine was not up to task.\nInstead of finding a way back home, Guo decided to stay in the area as his plane underwent repairs and upgrades.\nHe ended up spending several months there as he waited for his engine to be repaired amid a heavy backlog. He made good use of his time by working for a flight school at the airport, where he learned to diagnose and repair planes just like his.\nThis time out, he said he has a far better working knowledge of his engine and the overall mechanics of the plane, so this time around he'll know what problems to look for before taking off.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like making the same mistake twice,\u201d he said.\nGuo and the Guiness Book of World Records\nGuo began flying at 13 and already holds a record as the youngest person to fly to all 48 contiguous states, a feat he accomplished at 17, not long after earning his pilot's license.\nBecause he delayed his flight, he will no longer be in the running to be the youngest person to fly around the world. That title belongs to British-Belgian Mack Rutherford, who completed the trip in August 2022 at age 17.\n\"I'm not here for the record; I'm here for St. Jude's,\" he said.\nA lifelong dream and a cause close to home\nGuo began flying at 13 and had his pilot's license by 17. From the start, Guo said he knew he wanted to fly around the world.\n\u201cI think I only had five hours of flight experience when I first said that\u201d he said. \u201cNow I have between 600 and 700 hours.\"\nHe left high school for homeschooling, which allowed him more flight flexibility.\nHis flight ahead will cover about 50,000 miles.\n\u201cIt will be around 100 days if everything goes perfectly smooth, which it won't,\" he said.\nTying his dream to raising funds for St. Jude's was inspired by his teenage cousin in China who has Stage 4 Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.\nGuo said his cousin continues to receive treatment and hopes to visit him during his global journey.\n\"No family who receives treatment at St. Jude's has to pay, which is why it is so important to help them out as much as we can, and this is the least I can do,\" he said. \"We're all in this together.\"\nHe will visit all seven continents, including the difficult-to-maneuver Antarctica.\nGuo said he hopes to stop in several cities in several countries as he makes his way from one continent to the next., He would like to visit as many St. Jude\u2019s facilities as he can, where he hopes to inspire others with his journey.\n\"Their research has made childhood cancer survival rates go from 20 percent to 80 percent,\" he said, a claim backed up by a 2018 study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.\nGuo looks to the trip ahead\nWhile Guo knows success is not guaranteed, he plans to be as prepared as possible.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a masochist. I don\u2019t find pleasure in risking my life,\u201d he said.\nThe trip across the Atlantic will take around 14 hours, he said. Leaving him without a chance to sleep or use the bathroom.\nAsked about he intends to stay alert during that long stretch, Guo was quick to reply.\u2019\n\"It\u2019s survival instinct,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I sleep, I die.\u201d\nHe said his luggage will be reduced to about what one could carry on a commercial flight, both because of the space and weight.\n\u201cThe plane is very weight sensitive,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s me, a few bags and 1,000 gallons of fuel.\u201d\nHe will fast as much as possible to cut down on the need to use a bathroom.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get better at a goal without pushing your limits,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to throw myself into a situation where I\u2019m forced to grow,\u201d he said.\nFlying isn't easy, but paperwork is harder\nThe real challenge in making the trip work has more to do with issues on the ground than in the sky, Guo said.\n\u201cFlying isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s harder than driving a car, but the hardest part is the logistics and paperwork,\" said Guo, who has undertaken the task on his own of submitting the necessary permits and documents from each country he plans to visit.\nGuo is used to doing such big tasks on on his own, which has included soliciting sponsorships from companies and other fundraising efforts since he was 15.\nIt\u2019s almost like running a company,\u201d he said.\nAlthough Guo will visit more countries over the next several months than most people see in a lifetime, he won't have time to visit well-known international landmarks like the Eiffel Tower. He said his landings will include a quick meal, sleep and waking up the next day to immediately take to the skies again.\n\u201cThis trip is not a vacation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an endurance test.\u201d\nGuo's future options: Software design, genetics, professional pilot\nWhile Guo is focused in the short term on the arduous journey ahead, his future is filled with possibilities.\nHe said he has already been offered work as a private charter pilot, and he is considering getting a commercial pilot's license.\nOn the ground, Guo said he could attend college with a focus on STEM courses, particularly in the field of genetics.\nAnd just for good measure, he is working with a team that could develop into a software company, with the first product being a time-management app on which he has been working.\n\"I don't know where I'll end up exactly, but I have a lot of options,\" he said.\nTo donate to Flight Against Cancer, search \"Ethan Guo\" at Fundraising.stjude.org.

Luego, y sin autorizaci\u00f3n, continu\u00f3 a la Ant\u00e1rtica, infringiendo normas del c\u00f3digo aeron\u00e1utico chileno.\nLos antecedentes de la defensa\nSin embargo, la defensa entreg\u00f3 una serie de antecedentes al Ministerio P\u00fablico, solicitando que sean agregados a la carpeta investigativa y que consiste en una serie de comunicaciones, documentos e im\u00e1genes que comprobar\u00edan que Guo no cometi\u00f3 faltas.\nSeg\u00fan lo se\u00f1alado en el escrito, al que tuvo acceso La Tercera, el piloto pretend\u00eda viajar el mismo d\u00eda que aterriz\u00f3 en Punta Arenas: 24 de junio, pero debido a las condiciones clim\u00e1ticas, fue imposible. Despu\u00e9s de ello, se organiz\u00f3 e inspeccion\u00f3 su nave, programando un viaje para los pr\u00f3ximos d\u00edas con todos los permisos.\n\u201cDe acuerdo con lo planificado, el 27 de junio, la aeronave despeg\u00f3 desde SCCI hacia SAWH. Sin embargo, por expresa instrucci\u00f3n de la DGAC, tuvo que regresar despu\u00e9s de haber completado casi la mitad de la ruta, aproximadamente dos horas de vuelo, debido a que hab\u00edan olvidado devolver su pasaporte. Esta negligencia por parte de la DGAC caus\u00f3 un grave perjuicio a Ethan Guo, quien tuvo que posponer sus planes para el d\u00eda siguiente, con la carga f\u00edsica y emocional que ello supone\u201d, indic\u00f3 el documento.\nDespu\u00e9s de esto, en su viaje del 28 de junio se indic\u00f3 que Guo aterriz\u00f3 en el aer\u00f3dromo p\u00fablico de Ant\u00e1rtica, Teniente Marsh, sin autorizaci\u00f3n, sin embargo en el escrito exponen la conversaci\u00f3n de WhatsApp entre el piloto y Jan Carlo Oneto, Jefe del Subdepartamento de Servicios de Aer\u00f3dromos de DGAC.\nEn ella este alto funcionario de DGAC responde expresamente a Ethan Guo que puede aterrizar en SCRM (Teniente Marsh), con un escueto \u201cyes\u201d.\nAsimismo, el documento revela conversaciones entre los centros de comunicaci\u00f3n a\u00e9rea de la DGAC en donde dan cuenta del cambio de ruta de Guo hacia la Ant\u00e1rtica:\n\u201cDGAC ten\u00eda conocimiento de la modificaci\u00f3n del plan de vuelo de mi representado a Ant\u00e1rtica, particularmente a Marambio, base Argentina (SAWB), lo que es concordante con las comunicaciones que minutos m\u00e1s tarde mi representado sostendr\u00eda con el controlador de Teniente Marsh, quien le solicita confirmar su intenci\u00f3n de modificar nuevamente el plan de vuelo desde SAWB a SCRM, a lo que el se\u00f1or Guo, responde afirmativamente, solicitando autorizaci\u00f3n para aterrizar en dicho aer\u00f3dromo por razones de seguridad\u201d, indica en el documento.\nEl abogado defensor tambi\u00e9n entrega un reporte m\u00e9dico donde se indica que la salud de Guo se ha visto afectada, \u201ccon riesgo de empeorar.

      "text": "A judge in Chile has agreed to suspend proceedings against a teenage American pilot and social media influencer who has been stuck on a remote Antarctic island since late June after he was accused of landing there without permission.\nEthan Guo was attempting to fly to all seven continents solo, raising funds for cancer research, when he landed on a part of Antarctica where the South American country maintains a territorial claim. Prosecutors accused him of providing false information to ground control about his landing point.\nOn Monday, a judge approved an agreement between Guo\u2019s lawyers and prosecutors to suspend the proceedings on the condition that he donate $30,000 to a children\u2019s cancer foundation within 30 days. He must also leave the country and will be prohibited from reentering Chilean territory for three years.\nChilean prosecutor Cristi\u00e1n Crisosto told CNN on Tuesday that if Guo does not meet the conditions, the agreement would become void and the court proceedings would continue.\nCNN is attempting to reach Guo for comment.\nCrisosto said Guo and his plane were still in Antarctic territory and that he would also have to pay the costs of \u201caircraft security and personal maintenance.\u201d In previous cases, he said, such costs have been roughly $600 a day.\nGuo has several options to leave the Antarctic, Crisosto added, including boarding a military ship or commercial plane. The next commercial flight is expected to take off from the southern Chilean city of Punta Arenas in early October.\nChilean authorities said that Guo had submitted a false flight plan and took off from Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo Airport in Punta Arenas as the sole passenger and crew member aboard a Cessna 182Q aircraft, registered as N182WT, in late June. At one point during that flight, authorities say he turned off course toward Antarctica.\nGuo\u2019s lawyer has previously said that the young pilot experienced \u201ccomplications\u201d while flying.\n\u201cWhile already in the air, he began to experience a series of complications,\u201d Karina Ulloa said, adding that Guo claims \u201cthat he was conducting an exploratory flight to see if he could follow this route or not.\u201d\nGuo, whose website states he was trying to raise $1 million for cancer research by becoming \u201cthe first person ever to fly to all seven continents solo,\u201d had broadcast his continent-hopping journey since last September to more than a million Instagram followers."
