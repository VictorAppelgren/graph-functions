  "content": "Homebase has confirmed the exact date of a brand new opening in the UK that will be based at the site of a former Homebase store. The DIY and garden retailer has been opening new Garden Centres by Homebase inside The Range stores throughout the year after collapsing into administration at the end of 2024. Homebase was forced to call in administrators last November and later struck a deal with retail group CDS, which owns The Range, to save some of its stores. CDS snapped up 70 Homebase branches as part of the deal, saving around 1,600 jobs, while rival DIY chain B&Q took control of five branches and a further four have since been transformed into Wickes. Homebase has already opened more than 200 garden centres inside selected The Range stores so far and now another new opening is about to open its doors, but this time it will be inside a former Homebase unit.\n\nThe retailer has confirmed its latest garden centre will open on Friday, August 15, and will be based in the former Homebase unit at Enterprise Retail Park in Bradford, West Yorkshire. The new site will be open to customers from 9am and those who visit on the opening day will have the chance to snap up some exclusive offers and goodie bags. Announcing the opening date in a post on Facebook today, Homebase said: \"1 WEEK TO GO! We\u2019re so excited to be opening another 'Garden Centres by Homebase' in the former Homebase unit at Enterprise Retail Park, Eccleshill. \"Save the Date: Friday 15th August 2025 at 9am! Expect exclusive offers, goodie bags for the first in the queue, and a first look at everything Garden Centres by Homebase has to offer! \u201cFind your local Garden Centre by Homebase here.\"\n\nThe new opening comes after Homebase recently announced it had officially opened more than 50 brand new garden centres in The Range stores across the UK and Ireland in May this year. Each location provides shoppers with a selection of premium plants and garden accessories to help transform outdoor spaces. The openings come alongside the launch of \u2018Kitchens by Homebase\u2019 in selected stores and a new Homebase Bathstore is due to be coming soon. Homebase said: \u201cA massive THANK YOU for all the support you\u2019ve shown us so far in 2025. Stay tuned \u2013 more Homebase Hot News is on the way!\u201d",
