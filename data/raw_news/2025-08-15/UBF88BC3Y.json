  "title": "Our Single Biggest Challenge \u2013 And Reward \u2013 With AI",
  "description": "The challenge with AI is,,,",
  "content": "Artificial Intelligence has now been around long enough for us to be using it in smarter and better ways than we are. In fact, most of us are missing the boat entirely but we just don\u2019t know it.\n\nMost of the conversation surrounding AI \u2013 whether around kitchen table forums or The World Economic Forum \u2013 carries the weight of job loss or even industry and occupation extinction.\n\nAnd the reason is simple. We\u2019re trying to compete with it, something we know is impossible. AI has mastered (?) lower- and entry-level skills, such as data analysis and paralegal work. So why are we still competing? Why are we not using AI to build our second-level skills? And beyond? Or our transferable skills, for that matter?\n\nBut it\u2019s up to you. The bad news is that no one will serve anything to you on a silver platter anymore. The good news is that you don\u2019t need that anymore, either.\n\nThere are more online courses on more sites than you can shake a stick at. These sites are known as MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) and they give us access, it seems, to humanity\u2019s library. But before beginning any courses \u2013 which I recommend to all, without exception \u2013 how about asking AI to plot out a strategy and curriculum based on your interests, background, schedule, an.d goals, while considering what the world will be like for the foreseeable future? That\u2019s an example of using AI smartly\n\nNow comes the commitment. Plain and simple, this never ends, but the minute you step off the train, you forfeit your place on it. So, listen to this career and executive coach and leadership advisor. The challenge with AI is not to let it get out in front of you. The reward comes when you get and stay out ahead. It\u2019s like our hominid ancestors, once they domesticated animals. They stopped fighting the forces of those super-powerful beasts and harnessed all that power instead,\n\nAccept the challenge and reap the reward.",

  "summary": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been around long enough for us to be using it smarter and better ways than we are, according to career and executive coach and leadership advisor, Dr. Michael Wolff. He suggests that most of us are ignoring AI's lower- and entry-level skills, such as data analysis and paralegal work, which have already mastered these skills. The challenge is not to compete with AI but to use these skills to build second-tier skills beyond and transferable transferable ones. Wolff suggests that using AI smartly and planning strategy and curriculum based on interests, background, schedule, and future scenarios could yield rewards.",

  "argos_summary": "The article argues that while AI is often feared for job loss, it should instead be embraced as a tool to enhance learning and skill development. It suggests using AI to design personalized learning paths through MOOCs, aligning education with personal interests, background, and future job market trends. The piece encourages continuous commitment to learning, likening the adoption of AI to how early humans domesticated animals, and warns against falling behind by resisting rather than harnessing AI\u2019s power.",
