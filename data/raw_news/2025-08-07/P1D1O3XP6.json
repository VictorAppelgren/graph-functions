  "title": "RFK Jr.'s vow to overhaul vaccine injury program echoes grievances of anti-vaccine movement",
  "description": "Health Secretary Robert F",
  "content": "But they also worry Kennedy\u2019s changes will reflect his history as a leader in the anti-vaccine movement , which has alternately called for abolishing the program or expanding it to cover unproven injuries and illnesses that aren\u2019t connected to vaccines .\n\nProgram is credited with saving the U.S. vaccine industry\n\nSigned into law under President Ronald Reagan, the compensation program is designed to provide quick, efficient compensation to Americans who report known injuries associated with vaccines, such as rare allergic reactions . At the time of its creation, a number of vaccine-makers were exiting the business due to risks of class action lawsuits.\n\nDowning and Kennedy have had roles in HPV vaccine lawsuits\n\nIn a podcast last year for people with the condition, Downing lamented that the injury compensation program \u201chas taken a hard line\u201d against such cases, leading lawyers to file injury lawsuits in civil court. Approximately 70% of the Gardasil cases against Merck started as claims filed by Downing in the federal injury program, according to court records.\n\nBefore joining the government, Kennedy received payments for referring potential Gardasil clients to Wisner Baum, one of the law firms suing Merck. Following questions about the agreement during his confirmation hearings, Kennedy agreed to give up his stake in the deal and transfer any future fees to \u201ca nondependent, adult son,\u201d according to his financial disclosures.\n\nExperts see need for reform\n\nThe cap on compensation remains $250,000 for injury or death, the same as in 1986. Similarly, the program still has eight adjudicators, known as special masters, to review all cases before the government. On average, the process takes two to three years.\n\nEven small changes could improve things. For instance, the statute of limitations for claims could be extended beyond the current three years, which lawyers say cuts off many potential clients.",

VAIDS is not a real condition, experts say. The co-authors of the study say their work is being misrepresented and doesn\u2019t show that the vaccine is harmful to the immune system.\nTHE FACTS: As U.S. health officials recommend most Americans receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine, some online are re-airing false claims about the shots \u2014 with a new spin.\nThe social media posts claim that a new study proves the debunked notion that the vaccines cause a supposed condition called vaccine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or \u201cVAIDS,\u201d which experts have previously told The Associated Press isn\u2019t a real condition.\n\u201cPfizer\u2019s COVID Vaccine Causes VAIDS in Children, Study Proves,\u201d reads the headline of a widespread blog post.\nA post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, sharing the blog post relayed a quote from it, claiming: \u201c\u2018Finally, we have scientific confirmation that vaccination against COVID-19 causes a marked decrease in immunity to heterologous pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi.\u2019 A condition known as \u2018VAIDS\u2019 vaccine-induced AIDS.\u201d\nThe blog post references a study published in August in the journal Frontiers in Immunology, \u201cBNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children alters cytokine responses to heterologous pathogens and Toll-like receptor agonists.\u201d\nBut that study\u2019s findings are being misrepresented, the authors and an independent expert say.\nDr. Andr\u00e9s No\u00e9, a co-author of the study and researcher at the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute in Australia, pointed to a statement the authors published responding to such claims.\n\u201cIt has been brought to our attention that our recently published study is being misinterpreted and misused to claim that COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cOur research does not provide any evidence to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines are harmful to the immune system of children or adults. In particular, it is incorrect to suggest that our study results show that COVID-19 vaccines \u2018suppress the immune system.\u2019\u201d\nThe study examined blood samples from children one month and six months after receiving a Pfizer vaccine and observed changes in what\u2019s known as \u201ccytokine production\u201d by immune cells when encountering various pathogens, the authors explained.\nThey noted, however, that such responses \u201care only one facet of the body\u2019s combined immune response and we do not know how long they last.\u201d The study did not look at what the changes mean in the real world or determine whether they\u2019re harmful or helpful.\nDr. Matthew Laurens, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine\u2019s Center for Vaccine Development who was not involved in the study, concurred that it doesn\u2019t show the vaccine is dangerous or leading to immune system problems.\n\u201cOn the contrary, they suggest that vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 may provide protection against other infectious diseases, something that would have to be examined in another study,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThese \u2018off-target\u2019 effects of vaccination are viewed as beneficial, not as a risk.\u201d\nBoth Laurens and the study authors noted that similar, positive changes have been seen with the BCG vaccine \u2014 used in some parts of the world against tuberculosis \u2014 in which the immunization has been associated with potential protection against other illnesses.\nMoreover, credible scientific studies support the benefit of COVID-19 vaccines, Laurens said, not the concept of \u201cVAIDS.\u201d\n\u201cVAIDS is something that simply does not exist,\u201d Laurens said. \u201cIt is not found in the scientific literature. There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccination leads to immunodeficiency.\u201d\n___\nThis is part of AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.

That translated to 1.5 cases per million in people who got the GSK RSV vaccine, and five cases per million in recipients of the Pfizer shot.\nCDC officials presented similar findings on the RSV shots and Guillain-Barre syndrome at a February public meeting.\nAn estimated 3,000 to 6,000 people develop Guillain-Barre syndrome in the U.S. each year \u2014 either after being infected by a virus or linked to a vaccination \u2014 and it\u2019s more common in older people, according to the CDC.

      "text": "Baseless claims about safety of mRNA vaccines circulate online\nCLAIM: Humans and other mammals injected with an mRNA vaccine die within five years.\nAP\u2019S ASSESSMENT: False. There is no scientific evidence to suggest humans or other mammals given an mRNA vaccine die within five years, experts told The Associated Press. In fact, there\u2019s ample evidence that mRNA vaccines, including those to prevent COVID-19, are safe and effective.\nTHE FACTS: Social media users are reviving concerns that mRNA-based vaccines, including those that are used to combat COVID-19, are extremely deadly.\nThe latest claim is that anyone injected with the immunization will die within five years.\n\u201cNo mammal injected with mRNA has ever survived longer than 5 years. The die-off has begun,\u201d one user on Twitter wrote in a post that\u2019s been liked or shared more than 17,000 times as of Tuesday.\nBut there\u2019s no scientific proof that the mRNA vaccination shortens life expectancy or has led to mass die offs in humans or other mammals since research began on them decades ago, experts told the AP\n\u201cNothing of the scale suggested has happened,\u201d Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes, chief of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, told the AP. \u201cThe vast majority of the millions who have been injected are doing just fine.\u201d\nVaccines utilizing messenger RNA, or mRNA, teach cells how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response that protects a person from becoming seriously ill from a disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe molecule was first discovered in the early 1960s and research into its uses in medical treatment progressed into the 1970s and 1980s, according to Johns Hopkins University\u2019s School of Public Health.\nA flu vaccine based on mRNA was tested on mice in the 1990s, but the first vaccines for rabies and influenza weren\u2019t tested on humans until recently. Kuritzkes said no deaths from those vaccines were reported in those trials.\nMeanwhile, hundreds of millions of people worldwide have been inoculated against COVID-19 in the last couple of years and reports of death after vaccination remain rare.\nHealthcare providers are required to report any death after a COVID-19 shot to the federal government\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), even if it\u2019s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause.\nMore than 600 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the U.S. from December 2020 through last week, according to the CDC.\nDuring that time, there have been more than 16,500 preliminary reports of death, or 0.0027% of those that have received a COVID-19 vaccine.\nOf those, the CDC has identified just nine deaths causally associated with rare blood clots caused by the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which is not mRNA based like those produced by Pfizer and Moderna.\nKuritzkes also notes that mRNA only lasts in the body for a short period of time before rapidly degrading, making it unlikely that it would cause long term effects.\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re just now getting to the five-year mark for some of the earliest studies is not evidence that people die from the vaccines,\u201d he said. \u201cJust evidence that five years have yet to elapse for many trials. Sort of like saying nobody who voted in the 2020 presidential election has lived more than five years.\u201d\nDr. Stuart Ray, an assistant dean at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, suggests social media users might be conflating the fact that animal test subjects are generally euthanized after a scientific experiment has run its course.\nMice, which are typically the first mammals used in clinical studies, also tend to live only around three years, he said.\n\u201cWe have ample evidence that the mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 in particular have saved countless lives,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cHealthcare workers and biomedical researchers have been quick to accept mRNA vaccination, suggesting that their knowledge of the risks and benefits hasn\u2019t dampened their willingness to receive mRNA vaccines.\u201d\n___\nThis is part of AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.

Here\u2019s what he\u2019s done as health secretary\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearings, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested he wouldn\u2019t undermine vaccines.\n\u201cI am not going to go into HHS and impose my preordained opinions on anybody at HHS,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to empower the scientists at HHS to do their job and make sure that we have good science that is evidence based.\u201d\n- The Trump administration continued to reshape U.S. health policy in recent days. A look at the changes they\u2019ve made.\n- Kennedy\u2019s advisers endorsed this fall\u2019s flu vaccinations, but only if they use certain shots free of thimerosal, an ingredient antivaccine groups have falsely tied to autism.\n- The FDA is requiring updated and expanded warnings on COVID-19 vaccines about a rare heart side effect.\nHe also said he wouldn\u2019t halt congressionally mandated funding for vaccination programs, nor impose conditions that would force local, state or global entities to limit access to vaccines or vaccine promotion.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to substitute my judgment for science,\u201d he said.\nYet the Department of Health and Human Services under Kennedy has taken unprecedented steps to change how vaccines are evaluated, approved and recommended \u2014 sometimes in ways that run counter to established scientific consensus.\nHere\u2019s a look at what Kennedy has said and done since becoming the nation\u2019s top health official on Feb. 13.\nKennedy and the childhood vaccine schedule\nSen. Bill Cassidy, a physician who was unsettled about Kennedy\u2019s antivaccine work, said Kennedy pledged to him that he wouldn\u2019t change existing vaccine recommendations.\n\u201cI recommend that children follow the CDC schedule. And I will support the CDC schedule when I get in there,\u201d Kennedy said at his Senate confirmation hearing.\nKennedy also said he thought the polio vaccine was safe and effective and that he wouldn\u2019t seek to reduce its availability.\nFeb. 18: Kennedy vows to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule that prevents measles, polio and other dangerous diseases.\nEarly March: The National Institutes of Health cancels studies about ways to improve vaccine trust and access.\nApril 9: Kennedy tells CBS News that \u201cpeople should get the measles vaccine, but the government should not be mandating those,\u201d before then continuing to raise safety concerns about vaccines.\nMay 22: Kennedy issues a report that, among other things, questioned the necessity of mandates that require children to get vaccinated for school admission and suggested that vaccines should undergo more clinical trials, including with placebos. The report has to be reissued later because the initial version cited studies that don\u2019t exist.\nMay 30: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention removes COVID-19 vaccination guidance for pregnant women and says healthy children \u201cmay\u201d get the shots.\nJune 25: A group of vaccine advisers picked by Kennedy announce they are establishing a work group to evaluate the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of the children\u2019s vaccine schedule.\nJune 25: Kennedy announces the U.S. will stop supporting the vaccines alliance Gavi. He accuses the group, along with the World Health Organization, of silencing \u201cdissenting views\u201d and \u201clegitimate questions\u201d about vaccine safety.\nKennedy on revising CDC vaccine recommendations\nAt the confirmation hearing, Cassidy asked Kennedy: \u201cDo you commit that you will revise any CDC recommendations only based on peer review, consensus based, widely accepted science?\u201d\nKennedy replied, \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d adding he would rely on evidence-based science.\nFeb. 20: HHS postpones a meeting of outside vaccine advisers.\nApril 16: The CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory panel meets and recommends that people 50 to 59 with certain risk factors should be able to get vaccinated against respiratory syncytial virus, and endorses a new shot that protects against meningococcal bacteria. As of late June, the CDC and HHS haven\u2019t acted on the recommendations.\nMay 27: Kennedy announces that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women \u2014 a move immediately questioned by several public health experts. No one from the CDC, the agency that makes such recommendations, is present in the video announcing the changes.\nJune 9: Kennedy ousts all 17 members of the science panel that advises the CDC on how vaccines should be used.\nJune 11: Kennedy names new vaccine policy advisers to replace the panel that he dismissed. They include a scientist who rose to prominence by relaying conspiracy theories around the COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccines that followed, a leading critic of pandemic-era lockdowns, a business school professor, and a nurse affiliated with a group that is widely considered to be a leading source of vaccine misinformation.\nJune 26: Kennedy\u2019s vaccine advisers recommend that people receive flu shots free of an ingredient that antivaccine groups have falsely tied to autism. The vote comes after a presentation from an antivaccine group\u2019s former leader. A CDC staff analysis of past research on the topic is removed from the agency\u2019s website because, according to a committee member, the report hadn\u2019t been authorized by Kennedy\u2019s office.\nKennedy on vaccine approvals and review standards\nAt the Senate hearing, Cassidy asked Kennedy if he would keep FDA\u2019s historically rigorous vaccine review standards.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Kennedy replied.\nMarch 29: Kennedy forces the FDA\u2019s top vaccine official to resign. The official, Peter Marks, says he feared Kennedy\u2019s team might manipulate or delete data from a vaccine safety database.\nMay 6: Kennedy names Dr. Vinay Prasad, an outspoken critic of the FDA\u2019s handling of COVID-19 boosters, as the FDA\u2019s vaccine chief.\nMay 16: After a delay, the FDA grants Novavax full approval for its COVID-19 vaccine but with unusual restrictions: The agency says it\u2019s for use only in adults 65 and older \u2013 or those 12 to 64 who have at least one health problem that puts them at increased risk from COVID-19.\nMay 20: Top officials limit the approval for seasonal COVID-19 shots to seniors and others at high risk, pending more data on everyone else. The FDA urges companies to conduct large, lengthy studies before tweaked vaccines can be approved for healthier people, a stark break from the previous federal policy recommending an annual COVID-19 shot for all Americans six months and older.\nMay 30: FDA approves a new COVID-19 vaccine made by Moderna but with the same limits on who can get it as Novavax\u2019s shot.\nKennedy on bird flu vaccine\nAt his confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he would support the development of a vaccine for H5N1 bird flu.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to continue research on every kind of vaccine,\u201d he said.\nMay 28: The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, an HHS agency, cancels $766 million in awards to Moderna to develop a vaccine against potential pandemic influenza viruses, including the H5N1 bird flu.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Kennedy Jr., endorsed the measles vaccine this month after an outbreak in Texas claimed the life of a second child, his comments made waves because he has spent 20 years making false claims that vaccines are unsafe.\nMany of Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine allies stood by him anyway, trying to tamp down concerns from others who accused Kennedy of abandoning their movement.\nThat\u2019s because, according to doctors, public health experts and propaganda researchers who know Kennedy\u2019s history well, the health and human services secretary is threading the needle between his agency\u2019s role as a neutral arbiter of science and the rhetoric of anti-vaccine activists. They say his word choices reflect that he is working from the anti-vaccine playbook he has used for much of his career in public life.\nBelow, The Associated Press examines his comments about the measles outbreak that has infected more than 700 people nationwide and killed three, how his allies have interpreted them, and the facts according to scientists.\nA Kennedy spokesperson said the health secretary is not anti-vaccine and had \u201cresponded to the measles outbreak with clear guidance that vaccines are the most effective way to prevent measles.\u201d He did not respond to questions about how Kennedy\u2019s comments were being interpreted by his allies in the anti-vaccine movement.\nEndorsing vaccines, but then sowing doubt\nWHAT KENNEDY SAID: \u201cThe federal government\u2019s position, my position, is people should get the measles vaccine, but the government should not be mandating those,\u201d Kennedy told CBS this month after an unvaccinated child in Texas died of measles.\nLater, in the same interview, Kennedy raised safety concerns about the measles vaccine, saying testing was inadequate. He also raised safety concerns about the vaccine for pertussis.\nWHAT HIS ALLIES HEARD: Charlene Bollinger, who runs a business selling anti-vaccine videos and other products, highlighted in a Substack post how Kennedy had raised safety concerns.\nIn posts on X, she urged critics of his comments to \u201cTrust him. Trust me. He\u2019s not walked through fire for years to abandon us now,\u201d then added, \u201cRead what he said carefully and with a critical spirit ... pay attention to the things he didn\u2019t say. There are clues.\u201d\nThe group American Values, which was set up to support Kennedy\u2019s presidential run, posted a thread on X that amplified Kennedy\u2019s comments questioning vaccine safety.\nTHE FACTS, ACCORDING TO SCIENTISTS: The measles vaccine is safe and effective, and protecting people from outbreaks requires nearly everyone to be vaccinated. Public schools in the United States generally require children to be vaccinated against measles to attend, though a growing number of parents have been avoiding those mandates for their children, in some cases by getting exemptions. That has fueled low vaccination rates in communities around the U.S., which has left them vulnerable to measles and other infectious diseases. Just 92.7% of kindergartners got their required shots in 2023, below the 95% threshold for preventing outbreaks.\nREADING BETWEEN THE LINES: If Kennedy had truly changed his mind about the benefits of vaccines, he would have explained what he got wrong in the past, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. He didn\u2019t do that and instead immediately questioned how vaccines are safety tested.\n\u201cIf someone like RFK Jr. with his record were going to make an about-face on his position on the measles vaccine, you would expect an essay, an articulation of what he got wrong in the past. You\u2019re not seeing that,\u201d Adalja said. \u201cThe fact that he undercuts it almost immediately speaks to that.\u201d\nSaying people who died of measles were \u2018already sick\u2019\nWHAT KENNEDY SAID: Health authorities have said the two children who died were both unvaccinated, that they died as a result of measles and that neither had any reported underlying conditions. But Kennedy suggested those who died during the outbreak were \u201cpeople who were already sick.\u201d He said the second child who died had various other health problems and asserted that \u201c the thing that killed her was not the measles, but it was a bacteriological infection.\u201d\n\u201cHer death was caused by pneumonia,\u201d Kennedy told Fox News. \u201cSo, you know, her parents said that she was over measles two weeks before.\u201d\nKennedy\u2019s spokesperson did not respond to questions asking where he got his information about the child\u2019s medical history and to clarify why what he said conflicted with statements from health officials.\nWHAT HIS ALLIES HEARD: The anti-vaccine group Kennedy led for years, Children\u2019s Health Defense, promoted his comments, posting a clip online and saying it shows that Kennedy \u201cconfirms the so-called \u2018measles deaths\u2019 are NOT actually measles deaths.\u201d\nAmerican Values wrote that his comments constituted a \u201cbombshell\u201d because the child \u201cdid not pass away from measles, despite what the media claimed.\u201d\nTHE FACTS, ACCORDING TO SCIENTISTS: Pneumonia is a complication of measles, and is the most common cause of death from measles in young children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a subsidiary of HHS.\nREADING BETWEEN THE LINES: Kennedy\u2019s comments suggesting measles didn\u2019t kill the child reflect longstanding tactics used to create doubt about vaccines, said Renee DiResta, a professor at Georgetown University who researches propaganda and has studied the anti-vaccine movement. She said Kennedy and Children\u2019s Health Defense have spent years telling people that measles is a routine and harmless childhood illness to justify the argument that a safe vaccine is somehow more risky than the disease.\n\u201cReframing these deaths as something other than what they are \u2013 deaths from measles, which is not harmless at all \u2013 is necessary to prop up the dual pillars of anti-vaccine propaganda in play here,\u201d she said.\nIt reflects a similar narrative that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people who wanted to minimize its seriousness suggested people were dying \u201cwith COVID\u201d rather than from COVID, said Richard Carpiano, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Riverside, who has closely followed Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine work. It\u2019s a way of minimizing the deadly nature of measles.\n\u2018Standing with the unvaccinated\u2019 and personal choice\nWHAT KENNEDY SAID: Kennedy attended the funeral of the 8-year-old girl who died, then posted online about meeting with her family and the family of a 6-year-old girl who died in February. In one post about the trip, he wrote that \u201cThe most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.\u201d He also posted photos of himself with the families.\nWHAT HIS ALLIES HEARD: Kennedy\u2019s positive comments about the measles vaccine prompted some criticism from his old group Children\u2019s Health Defense. CEO Mary Holland said in a video that Kennedy no longer speaks for the group, and said he had put out what she called \u201cvery partial information.\u201d She claimed that a vaccination for measles had caused her son\u2019s autism. But she went on to praise Kennedy\u2019s actions.\n\u201cPeople should not get lost in Bobby Kennedy saying that the vaccine can prevent measles,\u201d Holland said, adding, \u201cBobby went to stand with the unvaccinated. And he has said it\u2019s a personal choice.\u201d\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense and Bollinger have sued a number of news organizations, among them the AP, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines.\nTHE FACTS, ACCORDING TO SCIENTISTS: Scientists have ruled out any link between vaccines and autism. Vaccines have saved an estimated 154 million lives in the past 50 years, according to the World Health Organization, which says immunization has been the greatest contribution to ensuring babies live until their first birthday.\nREADING BETWEEN THE LINES: Carpiano said Kennedy helped the anti-vaccine movement pivot to the idea that it is about personal rights, personal freedoms and medical freedom. While there is a libertarian bent to it, that framing leaves out an important piece.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the freedom to do whatever you want. A libertarian would say, \u2018provided it doesn\u2019t hurt other people,\u2019\u201d he said. But when it comes to Kennedy and the anti-vaccine movement, the part about not hurting other people gets left out, Carpiano said. \u201cAnd so basically becomes a tyranny of the minority,\u201d Carpiano said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that he helps to keep promoting and legitimating.\u201d"

Side effects were injection site pain, fatigue and headaches. Moderna previously reported a summary of the results from the company-sponsored trial in 8,000 people.\nThe mRNA technology is used in approved COVID-19 and RSV shots, but has not yet been approved for a flu shot. Moderna believes mRNA could speed up production of flu shots compared with traditional processes that use chicken eggs or giant vats of cells. A combo shot also might improve vaccination rates, the researchers wrote in the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\nDr. Greg Poland, who studies vaccine response at Mayo Clinic and was not involved in the new study, said he\u2019s not convinced that a combo shot would be popular. And while flu comes in seasonal waves, COVID-19 has been spreading throughout the year, Poland said, posing challenges for how to time the shots to keep protection strong.\nHe\u2019d also like to see data on how well the new shot protected people from infection and hospitalization.\nThe findings are based on measuring antibodies in participants\u2019 blood after 29 days, an indication of short-term disease protection.\nLast week, Moderna pushed its target date for the vaccine\u2019s approval to 2026 after the Food and Drug Administration requested a more direct measure: how much the shot lowered the risk of disease.\n\u201cI agree in this case with FDA that efficacy data are important to see,\u201d Poland said.\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has cast doubt on the safety of mRNA vaccines, but Moderna President Stephen Hoge told investors in an earnings call last week that talks with the FDA were productive and \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d\nAlso last week, Novavax said the FDA was asking the company to run a new clinical trial of its protein-based COVID-19 vaccine after the agency grants full approval, sowing uncertainty about other vaccine updates.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

      "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a long record of promoting anti-vaccine views\nLong before the COVID-19 pandemic, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was building up a following with his anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, and becoming one of the world\u2019s most influential spreaders of fear and distrust around vaccines.\nNow, President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which regulates vaccines.\nKennedy has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism. He has also pushed other conspiracy theories, such as that COVID-19 could have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, comments he later said were taken out of context. He has repeatedly brought up the Holocaust when discussing vaccines and public health mandates.\nNo medical intervention is risk-free. But doctors and researchers have proven that risks from disease are generally far greater than the risks from vaccines.\nVaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades \u2014 they are considered among the most effective public health measures in history.\nKennedy has insisted that he is not anti-vaccine, saying he only wants vaccines to be rigorously tested, but he also has shown opposition to a wide range of immunizations. Kennedy said in a 2023 podcast interview that \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and told Fox News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism. In a 2021 podcast he urged people to \u201cresist\u201d CDC guidelines on when kids should get vaccines.\n\u201cI see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, better not get them vaccinated,\u201d Kennedy said.\nThat same year, in a video promoting an anti-vaccine sticker campaign by his nonprofit, Kennedy appeared onscreen next to one sticker that declared \u201cIF YOU\u2019RE NOT AN ANTI-VAXXER YOU AREN\u2019T PAYING ATTENTION.\u201d\nThe World Health Organization has estimated that global immunization efforts have saved at least 154 million lives in the past 50 years.\nIn a study of verified Twitter accounts from 2021, researchers found Kennedy\u2019s personal Twitter account was the top \u201csuperspreader\u201d of vaccine misinformation on Twitter, responsible for 13% of all reshares of misinformation, more than three times the second most-retweeted account.\nHe has traveled to states including Connecticut, California and New York to lobby or sue over vaccine policies and has traveled the world to meet with anti-vaccine activists.\nKennedy has also aligned himself with businesses and special interests groups such as anti-vaccine chiropractors, who saw profit in slicing off a small portion of the larger health care market while spreading false or dubious health information.\nAn Associated Press investigation found one chiropractic group in California had donated $500,000 to Kennedy\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Defense, about one-sixth of the group\u2019s fundraising that year. Another AP investigation found he was listed as an affiliate for an anti-vaccine video series, where he was ranked among the Top 10 for the series\u2019 \u201cOverall Sales Leaderboard.\u201d\nHis group has co-published a number of anti-vaccine books that have been debunked. One, called \u201cCause Unknown,\u201d is built on the false premise that sudden deaths of young, healthy people are spiking due to mass administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Experts say these rare medical emergencies are not new and have not become more prevalent.\nAn AP review of the book found dozens of individuals included in it died of known causes not related to vaccines, including suicide, choking while intoxicated, overdose and allergic reaction. One person died in 2019.\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit."

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says safer and more effective vaccines are being developed.\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Department of Health and Human Services will cancel contracts and pull funding for some vaccines that are being developed to fight respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and the flu.\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in a statement Tuesday that 22 projects, totaling $500 million, to develop vaccines using mRNA technology will be halted.\nKennedy\u2019s decision to terminate the projects is the latest in a string of decisions that have put the longtime vaccine critic\u2019s doubts about shots into full effect at the nation\u2019s health department. Kennedy has pulled back recommendations around the COVID-19 shots, fired the panel that makes vaccine recommendations, and refused to offer a vigorous endorsement of vaccinations as a measles outbreak worsened.\nThe health secretary criticized mRNA vaccines in a video on his social media accounts, explaining the decision to cancel projects being led by the nation\u2019s leading pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, that offer protection against viruses like the flu, COVID-19 and H5N1.\n\u201cTo replace the troubled mRNA programs, we\u2019re prioritizing the development of safer, broader vaccine strategies, like whole-virus vaccines and novel platforms that don\u2019t collapse when viruses mutate,\u201d Kennedy said in the video.\nInfectious disease experts say the mRNA technology used in vaccines is safe, and they credit its development during the first Trump administration with slowing the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Future pandemics, they warned, will be harder to stop without the help of mRNA.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a more dangerous decision in public health in my 50 years in the business,\u201d said Mike Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases and pandemic preparations.\nHe noted mRNA technology offers potential advantages of rapid production, crucial in the event of a new pandemic that requires a new vaccine.\nThe shelving of the mRNA projects is short-sighted as concerns about a bird flu pandemic continue to loom, said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly saved millions of lives,\u201d Offit said of the existing mRNA vaccines.\nScientists are using mRNA for more than infectious disease vaccines, with researchers around the world exploring its use for cancer immunotherapies. At the White House earlier this year, billionaire tech entrepreneur Larry Ellison praised mRNA for its potential to treat cancer.\nTraditionally, vaccines have required growing pieces of viruses, often in chicken eggs or giant vats of cells, then purifying that material. The mRNA approach starts with a snippet of genetic code that carries instructions for making proteins. Scientists pick the protein to target, inject that blueprint and the body makes just enough to trigger immune protection \u2014 producing its own vaccine dose.\nIn a statement Tuesday, HHS said \u201cother uses of mRNA technology within the department are not impacted by this announcement.\u201d\nThe mRNA technology is used in approved COVID-19 and RSV shots, but has not yet been approved for a flu shot. Moderna, which was studying a combination COVID-19 and flu mRNA shot, had said it believed mRNA could speed up production of flu shots compared with traditional vaccines.\nThe abandoned mRNA projects signal a \u201cshift in vaccine development priorities,\u201d the health department said in its statement, adding that it will start \u201cinvesting in better solutions.\u201d\n\u201cLet me be absolutely clear, HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them,\u201d Kennedy said in the statement.\nSpeaking hours later Tuesday at a news conference in Anchorage, Alaska, alongside the state\u2019s two Republican U.S. senators, Kennedy said work is underway on an alternative.\nHe said a \u201cuniversal vaccine\u201d that mimics \u201cnatural immunity\u201d is the administration\u2019s focus.\n\u201cIt could be effective \u2014 we believe it\u2019s going to be effective -- against not only coronaviruses, but also flu,\u201d he said.\n\u2014\nAssociated Press writers Lauran Neergaard in Washington, Mike Stobbe in New York and Becky Bohrer in Juneau contributed."

Kennedy Jr. warned that children in the U.S. are being diagnosed with autism at an \u201calarming rate,\u201d promising on Wednesday to conduct exhaustive studies to identify any environmental factors that may cause the developmental disorder.\nHis call comes the day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report that found an estimated 1 in 31 U.S. children have autism, a marked increase from 2020.\nAutism experts applaud efforts to further understand the condition, but say the number of reported cases began to balloon as the definition of the condition expanded to include mild cases.\n\u201cAutism destroys families,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cMore importantly, it destroys our greatest resource, which is our children. These are children who should not be suffering like this.\u201d\nKennedy described autism as a \u201cpreventable disease,\u201d although researchers and scientists have identified genetic factors that are associated with it. Autism is not considered a disease, but a complex disorder that affects the brain. Cases range widely in severity, with symptoms that can include delays in language, learning, and social or emotional skills. Some autistic traits can go unnoticed well into adulthood.\nThose who have spent decades researching autism have found no single cause. Besides genetics, scientists have identified various possible factors, including the age of a child\u2019s father, the mother\u2019s weight, and whether she had diabetes or was exposed to certain chemicals.\nKennedy said his wide-ranging plan to determine the cause of autism will look at all of those environmental factors, and others. He had previously set a September deadline for determining what causes autism, but said Wednesday that by then, his department will determine at least \u201csome\u201d of the answers.\nThe effort will involve issuing grants to universities and researchers, Kennedy said. He said the researchers will be encouraged to \u201cfollow the science, no matter what it says.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has recently canceled billions of dollars in grants for health and science research sent to universities.\nThe CDC\u2019s latest autism data was from 14 states and Puerto Rico in 2022. The previous estimate \u2014 from 2020 \u2014 was 1 in 36.\nBoys continue to be diagnosed more than girls, and the highest rates are among children who are Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native and Black.\nTo estimate how common autism is, the CDC checked health and school records for 8-year-olds, because most cases are diagnosed by that age. Other researchers have their own estimates, but experts say the CDC\u2019s estimate is the most rigorous and the gold standard.\nOn Wednesday, Kennedy criticized theories that the rise in autism cases can be attributed to more awareness about the disorder. Autism researchers have cited heightened awareness, as well as medical advancements and increased diagnoses of mild cases.\n\u201cThe reasons for increases in autism diagnosis come down to scientific and health care progress,\u201d said Annette Estes, director of the autism center at the University of Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for many people to understand this because the causes of autism are complex.\u201d\nThe Autism Science Foundation said Kennedy\u2019s emphasis on environmental factors contradicted the findings in the CDC\u2019s report.\n\u201cThis report is the most convincing evidence yet that changes in factors like access to services and de-stigmatization of (autism spectrum disorders) are leading to the increases in prevalence,\u201d said Autism Science Foundation Chief Science Officer Dr. Alycia Halladay.\n___\nAssociated Press writers JoNel Aleccia in Temecula, California, and Mike Stobbe in Atlanta contributed to this report."

The previous estimate \u2014 from 2020 \u2014 was 1 in 36.\nBoys continue to be diagnosed more than girls, and the highest rates are among children who are Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native and Black.\nTo estimate how common autism is, the CDC checked health and school records for 8-year-olds, because most cases are diagnosed by that age. Other researchers have their own estimates, but experts say the CDC\u2019s estimate is the most rigorous and the gold standard.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the new numbers, as well as Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s plan to do a \u201cmassive testing and research effort\u201d around autism.\nWhat is autism?\nAutism is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. There are many possible symptoms, many of which overlap with other diagnoses. They can include delays in language and learning, social and emotional withdrawal and an unusual need for routine.\nFor decades, the diagnosis was rare, given only to kids with severe problems communicating or socializing and those with unusual, repetitive behaviors.\nAs late as the early 1990s, only 1 in 10,000 children were diagnosed with autism. Around that time, the term became a shorthand for a group of milder, related conditions known as \u2033autism spectrum disorders,\u201d and the number of kids labeled as having some form of autism began to balloon.\nIn the first decade of this century, the estimate rose to 1 in 150. In 2018, it was 1 in 44. In 2020, it was up to 1 in 36.\nWhy are autism numbers rising?\nHealth officials largely attribute growing autism numbers to better recognition of cases through wide screening and better diagnosis.\nThere are no blood or biologic tests for autism. It\u2019s diagnosed by making judgments about a child\u2019s behavior, and there\u2019s been an explosion in autism-related treatment and services for children.\nRoughly two decades ago, studies by the CDC and others ruled out childhood vaccines as a cause of autism. Since then, a lot of research has looked at variety of other possible explanations, including genetics, the age of the father, the weight of the mother and whether she had diabetes and exposure to certain chemicals.\nSome researchers have theorized it may be a series of things \u2014 perhaps a biological predisposition set off by some sort of toxic exposure.\nVaccines and autism\nKennedy and anti-vaccine advocates have remained fixated on childhood vaccines, pointing at a preservative called thimerosal that is no longer in most childhood vaccines or theorizing that autism may be the cumulative effect of multiple vaccinations. A number of studies, including some with CDC authors, have not found such links.\nLast week, Kennedy said HHS was launching \u201ca massive testing and research effort that\u2019s going to involve hundreds of scientists from around the world\u201d and identify what causes autism in less than six months. He also promised \u201cwe\u2019ll be able to eliminate those exposures.\u201d\nKennedy and President Donald Trump both referred to the 1-in-31 estimate that CDC released Tuesday during last week\u2019s White House meeting, and Kennedy also repeated the statistic at a meeting with FDA officials on Friday,\nKennedy\u2019s statement followed reports that he had hired David Geier, a man who has repeatedly claimed a link between vaccines and autism, to lead the autism research effort. The hiring of Geier, whom Maryland found was practicing medicine on a child without a doctor\u2019s license, was first reported by The Washington Post.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

It\u2019s one of many inconsistencies\nDemocratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic because of his strident opposition to vaccines. Yet, he insists he\u2019s not anti-vaccine. He has associated with influential people on the far right \u2013 including Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon and Michael Flynn \u2013 to raise his profile. Yet, he portrays himself as a true Democrat inheriting the mantle of the Kennedy family.\nAs he challenges President Joe Biden, the stories he tells on the campaign trail about himself, his life\u2019s work and what he stands for are often the opposite of what his record actually shows.\nThough Kennedy\u2019s primary challenge to a sitting president is widely considered a longshot, he\u2019s been sucking up media attention due to his famous name and the possibility that his run could weaken Biden ahead of what is expected to be a close general election in 2024. He\u2019s drawn praise from Republican presidential candidates like Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Meanwhile, Trump supporters, including his longtime ally Roger Stone, have ginned up interest by floating a Trump-Kennedy unity ticket.\nDebra Duvall, 62, who lives in Fort Myers, Florida, and said she serves on the Lee County GOP executive committee, described herself as a longtime Trump supporter, but said she\u2019s torn for 2024.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take Trump or RFK. Either one,\u201d she said, explaining that she was drawn to both because she believes they can\u2019t be bought.\nThat kind of support has demonstrated some of the contradictions in Kennedy\u2019s candidacy. He has said he wants to \u201creclaim\u201d the Democratic Party, while aligning himself with far right figures who have worked to subvert American democracy. He touts his credentials as an environmentalist, yet pushes bitcoin \u2014 a cryptocurrency that requires massive amounts of electricity from supercomputers to generate new coins, prompting most environmental advocates to loudly oppose it.\nAnd though he peppers his speeches, podcast appearances and campaign materials with invocations of the Democratic Party legacies of his uncle President John F. Kennedy and his father, Robert F. Kennedy, his relatives have distanced themselves from him and even denounced him.\n\u201cHe\u2019s trading in on Camelot, celebrity, conspiracy theories and conflict for personal gain and fame,\u201d Jack Schlossberg, President Kennedy\u2019s grandson, said of his cousin in an Instagram video in July. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to him. I know him. I have no idea why anyone thinks he should be president. What I do know is, his candidacy is an embarrassment.\u201d\nKennedy\u2019s recent comments that COVID-19 could have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people \u2014 which he denies were antisemitic but concedes he should have worded more carefully \u2014 also drew a condemnation from his sister Kerry Kennedy.\nThe contradictions between what Kennedy says and his track record were nowhere more apparent than when he testified before a congressional committee in July at the invitation of Republican members.\nAnti-vaccine activists, some who work for Kennedy\u2019s nonprofit group Children\u2019s Health Defense, sat in the rows behind him, watching as he insisted \u201cI have never been anti-vaxx. I have never told the public to avoid vaccination.\u201d\nHave a news tip?\nContact AP\u2019s global investigative team at [email protected]. For secure and confidential communications, use the free Signal app +1 (202) 281-8604.\nBut that\u2019s not true. Again and again, Kennedy has made his opposition to vaccines clear. In July, Kennedy said in a podcast interview that \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and told FOX News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism. In a 2021 podcast he urged people to \u201cresist\u201d CDC guidelines on when kids should get vaccines.\n\u201cI see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, better not get them vaccinated,\u201d Kennedy said.\nThat same year, in a video promoting an anti-vaccine sticker campaign by his nonprofit, Kennedy appeared onscreen next to one sticker that declared \u201cIF YOU\u2019RE NOT AN ANTI-VAXXER YOU AREN\u2019T PAYING ATTENTION.\u201d\nA close examination of Kennedy\u2019s campaign finance filings shows that the anti-vaccine movement lies at the heart of his campaign.\nSeveral of his campaign staff and consultants have worked for his anti-vaccine group Children\u2019s Health Defense, including Mary Holland, the group\u2019s president on leave, campaign spokeswoman Stefanie Spear, and Zen Honeycutt, who hosted a show for the group\u2019s TV channel, CHD TV.\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines.\nThe campaign paid KFP Consulting, a Texas-based company run by Del Bigtree, head of the anti-vaccine group ICAN, and a leading voice in the movement, more than $13,000 for communications consulting, the AP found. Bigtree appeared to still be working for the campaign last week, when an AP reporter saw him helping facilitate a Kennedy event in New York.\nKennedy also has received substantial support from activists who have spread misinformation about the coronavirus and vaccines, including Steve Kirsch, an entrepreneur who has falsely claimed COVID-19 vaccines kill more people than they save, chiropractors Patrick Flynn and Kevin Stillwagon, and others.\nTy and Charlene Bollinger, who run an anti-vaccine business and who the AP has previously reported have had a financial relationship with Kennedy, gave more than $6,000. The couple, along with Kennedy\u2019s communication consultant Bigtree, were involved in hosting a rally near the Capitol on Jan. 6, and Ty Bollinger has said he was among the people who crowded at the Capitol doors in an attempt to get inside, though he said he did not enter.\nThe couple is a part of the Children\u2019s Health Defense lawsuit against AP and other media outlets.\nAmerican Values 2024, a super PAC supporting Kennedy, is run by close associates to Kennedy who have propped up anti-vaccine ideas \u2014 the former head of the New York chapter of Children\u2019s Health Defense John Gilmore is its CEO and Kennedy\u2019s publisher Tony Lyons is its co-chair.\nThe Kennedy campaign did not return emails seeking comment about a number of questions, including how he can say he is not anti-vaccine given his record and his support from anti-vaccine activists.\nKennedy\u2019s run is also getting plenty of financial support from the right. A super PAC supporting Kennedy\u2019s presidential run, called Heal the Divide PAC, has deep ties to Republicans, F ederal Election Commission records show.\nThe committee\u2019s address is listed in the care of RTA Strategy, a campaign consulting firm that has been paid for its work to help elect Republicans including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and the former Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker.\nThe PAC\u2019s treasurer, who works for RTA Strategy, is Jason Boles, a past donor to Trump and many other Republicans who includes \u201cMAGA\u201d and \u201cAmericaFirst\u201d in his bio on the platform X, formerly known as Twitter.\nKennedy denied knowing Boles or the Heal the Divide PAC when it came up at the congressional hearing, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of Mr. Boles, and I\u2019ve never heard of that super PAC.\u201d\nBut video available online shows he was a guest speaker at a Heal the Divide event just two days earlier. The video features a \u201cHeal the Divide 2024\u201d logo with clips of him speaking at length about plans to back the U.S. dollar with bitcoin and precious metals.\nKennedy says that as president, he would fight for government honesty and transparency, heal the political divide, reverse economic decline, end war and preserve civil liberties. He has made freedom of speech a major part of his platform, arguing that the government\u2019s communication with social media companies unfairly censors protected speech.\nKennedy\u2019s press office did not respond to several messages asking about his support from the far right.\nIt also did not respond to questions about whether his stance on bitcoin was at odds with being an environmentalist.\nKennedy lists the environment as one of six top priorities on his campaign website and has spent many years speaking against pollution and climate change as an environmental lawyer. Yet he has made supporting the energy-intensive cryptocurrency bitcoin a key part of his platform.\nBitcoin mining, the process of generating new coins, uses massive amounts of electricity \u2014 more than some entire countries use, said Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group.\nThat\u2019s because it works by tasking a network of supercomputers with solving complex mathematical puzzles \u2014 even as some other cryptocurrencies have adopted far more energy efficient mining methods.\n\u201cNo one who claims to be an environmentalist could support a digital asset that needlessly consumes more electricity than all Americans use to power the lights in our homes,\u201d Faber said. \u201cIn fact, bitcoin produces more climate pollution than any other digital asset.\u201d\nDespite the environmental downsides of bitcoin, some Democrats, including elected officials, have advocated for the currency.\nKennedy, for his part, told a crowd at Bitcoin 2023 that environmentalists like himself \u201cwill continue to pressure you to improve.\u201d Online, he has promoted the argument that demand for bitcoin will boost investment in new renewable energy projects.\nRegardless, his financial disclosure documents show he has already personally invested between $100,001 and $250,000 in bitcoin, and he promised at Bitcoin 2023 that he wouldn\u2019t let the environmental argument hinder the currency\u2019s use.\n\u201cAs president, I will make sure that your right to hold and use bitcoin is inviolable,\u201d he said.\nDuring the past several years, Kennedy has cultivated his ties to the far right. He has appeared on Infowars, the channel run by Sandy Hook conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. He has granted interviews to Trump ally Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson. After he headlined a stop on the ReAwaken America Tour, the Christian nationalist road show put together by former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, he was photographed backstage with Flynn, Charlene Bollinger and Trump ally Roger Stone.\nThose appearances have led to goodwill on the right, and he has found enthusiastic support among a segment of Trump\u2019s base, with some suggesting him as a potential vice presidential pick.\nAt a July 1 rally in the tiny town of Pickens, South Carolina, Adrian Palashevsky \u2013 a small businessman who described himself as more of a \u201clibertarian\u201d than a Republican \u2013 posited a unity ticket, with Kennedy as his top pick for Trump\u2019s VP.\n\u201cI think they would get along just fine,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re both anti-establishment, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re under so much attack.\u201d\nDeSantis, one of Trump\u2019s Republican challengers, has also indulged in praise for the fringe candidate, saying in a recent interview that while he wouldn\u2019t make Kennedy vice president, he would consider appointing him to one of the federal agencies that regulates vaccine safety and protects public health.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re president, you know, sic him on the FDA if he\u2019d be willing to serve, or sic him on CDC,\u201d DeSantis said.\nNot everyone is buying the Kennedy mystique.\nAt the annual meeting of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in New York a few weeks ago, Kennedy leaned heavily on his family legacy, mentioning his father\u2019s alliance with labor leader Cesar Chavez and his uncle\u2019s work in Latin American countries.\nBut in his nearly 20-minute speech, he didn\u2019t lay out any plan or policy proposals of his own, or talk about specific issues facing the Latino community. He spent most of his time telling a story about getting arrested with the Mexican American actor Edward Olmos in 2001, an attempt at relating with the community that disappointed both Republicans and Democrats in the audience.\nMario Ceballos, president of a PAC representing LGBTQ+ Latinos, said Kennedy\u2019s speech \u2014 and the candidate\u2019s conspiracy theory beliefs \u2014 saddened him.\n\u201cWhen I was living in Mexico, Kennedy was an American president that my whole family respected,\u201d Ceballos said. \u201cAnd what he is presenting are esoteric, dangerous options that are actually going to hurt the same people that his father and uncle wanted to help.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin in West Palm Beach, Florida, and Meg Kinnard in Pickens, South Carolina, contributed to this report.\n___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

      "text": "RFK Jr. wants federal health data so he can show vaccines are unsafe, Trump transition co-chair says\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) \u2014 A co-chair of Donald Trump\u2019s transition team said Trump supporter Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wants access to federal health data so he can show vaccines are unsafe and lead to them being pulled from the market in a second Trump administration.\nHoward Lutnick echoed a number of Kennedy\u2019s debunked anti-vaccine talking points in a CNN interview Wednesday, including falsehoods about the vaccine schedule and the disproven theory that vaccines cause autism. Trump has talked often about how Kennedy, who suspended his own presidential bid and endorsed him in August, will have a big role to play if the former president returns to the White House.\nWhile Lutnick said Kennedy would not be chosen as secretary of health and human services, he was not specific about what Kennedy\u2019s role might be. Lutnick made the comments the same day that Kennedy told NewsNation that Trump asked him to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and some agencies under the Department of Agriculture.\nThe comments by Lutnick raised immediate concerns among public health experts that giving influence to one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world could lead to what one said would be \u201csevere health consequences\u201d for Americans, especially children. They come just days before the Nov. 5 election and as Trump, a Republican, and Democrat Kamala Harris are vying to sway late-deciding voters to their side.\nLutnick, the CEO of the financial services company Cantor Fitzgerald, told CNN that Kennedy wants access to data \u201cso he can say these things are unsafe\u201d and that will stop the sales.\n\u201cHe says, if you give me the data, all I want is the data and I\u2019ll take on the data and show that it\u2019s not safe. And then if you pull the product liability, the companies will yank these vaccines right off of the market. So that\u2019s his point,\u201d Lutnick said.\nIt was unclear what data Lutnick was referring to since extensive data and research on vaccine safety is publicly available.\nThe World Health Organization has estimated that global immunization efforts have saved at least 154 million lives in the past 50 years.\nIn recent days, Trump has said he would let Kennedy \u201cgo wild\u201d on health, food and medicines. Kennedy has said repeatedly that he plans to exercise his influence over a wide range of policies if Trump wins and said Trump had promised him control over health agencies and told him he wanted him to reorganize them.\nAsked about Kennedy\u2019s comments and his role in a Trump administration, Jason Miller, a senior adviser for the campaign said the only thing Trump and his campaign are focused on is winning on Nov. 5.\n\u201cEverything after that is after that, and President Trump has made clear that Bobby Kennedy will play an important role,\u201d Miller wrote.\nIt would be \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d to put Kennedy in a position of power where he could make decisions or have the ability to change regulatory policy, said Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\u201cRemoving vaccines from the market would lead to severe health consequences for America,\u201d said Sharfstein, a former deputy commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. \u201cWe go about our daily lives in the United States not worrying about a lot of preventable diseases like measles because of the protection that the vaccines provide. But if there were to be a systematic effort to use the tools of the federal government to undermine vaccination, children won\u2019t be safe. Full stop.\u201d\nEven if Kennedy is given a lesser role where he provides input and comments but doesn\u2019t have control over policy, it could still be damaging, according to people who have served in public health roles in government.\n\u201cAdvisers like Scott Atlas have demonstrated the significant influence they can wield without congressional oversight, raising fears of misinformation and harm,\u201d Trump\u2019s own surgeon general, Dr. Jerome Adams, wrote in an email, referring to Trump\u2019s former COVID-19 pandemic advisor, a radiologist with no background in infectious disease, who advocated for the widely discredited herd immunity strategy.\nAdams said he believed it was unlikely that Kennedy could be appointed to lead a major health agency because he has no medical expertise, it would likely be difficult for him to pass a background check for a top secret clearance and he\u2019d likely lack support in Congress \u2014 though Trump circumvented the background check system during his first administration and stocked his Cabinet with acting officials who had not received congressional approval.\nKennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine organization has a lawsuit pending against news organizations including The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy is on leave from the group but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.\nRepublican lawmakers have long enjoyed \u2013 and reciprocated \u2013 support from pharmaceutical companies, even vowing to dismantle a law signed by Democratic President Joe Biden that allows the government to negotiate the price of prescription drugs for Medicare enrollees. Republicans have argued the law will hurt the businesses and stifle innovation in the industry. But vaccine skepticism, growing across the country, has become deeper among conservatives.\nIn addition to people\u2019s health and well-being, the possibility that Kennedy\u2019s influence would result in debunked ideas like a vaccine link to autism being again dredged up and wasting time, energy and money disheartened public health advocates.\n\u201cTrump helped bring the vaccine to market, and he took the vaccine. ... I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s giving this person this mouthpiece,\u201d said Amy Pisani, CEO of Vaccinate Your Family, noting Trump\u2019s Operation Warp Speed helped bring the COVID-19 vaccine to market, though Kennedy has relentlessly attacked it.\nVaccinate Your Family is a nonpartisan group co-founded by former first lady Rosalynn Carter and former Arkansas first lady Betty Bumpers that has worked on vaccine programs with both Republican and Democratic presidential administrations for the past 30 years.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back 30 years to fighting the anti-vaccine movement again,\u201d Pisani said. \u201cTo go back in time and waste millions and millions of taxpayer dollars on this witch hunt again is just untenable.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writer Amanda Seitz in Washington contributed to this report."

Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Health Secretary, has faced scrutiny over his history as a prominent anti-vaccine advocate, raising concerns about potential changes to vaccine policies.
