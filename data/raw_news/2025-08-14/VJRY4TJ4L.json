  "title": "Air quality concerns linger in the wake of steel plant explosion in Pennsylvania",
  "description": "Allegheny County is increasing air quality monitoring after an explosion at a U.S. Steel plant south of Pittsburgh killed two people and injured more than 10 others",
  "content": "After Monday\u2019s blast, the county health department initially told residents within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the plant to remain indoors and close all windows and doors. The department lifted the advisory after its monitors didn\u2019t detect levels of soot or sulfur dioxide above federal standards.\n\nThe Allegheny County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office also confirmed Thursday that the second person who died in the blast was Steven Menefee, 52, of Clairton. Earlier, the county medical examiner\u2019s office identified one of the dead as Timothy Quinn, 39.\n\nU.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said Tuesday the company is working closely with local, state and federal authorities. He would not speculate about the cause of the explosion.\n\nThe massive plant along the Monongahela River in Clairton converts coal to coke, a key component in the steelmaking process. The facility is considered the largest coking operation in North America and is one of four major U.S. Steel plants in Pennsylvania.\n\nTo make coke, coal is baked in special ovens for hours at high temperatures to remove impurities that could otherwise weaken steel. The process creates what is known as coke gas \u2014 a lethal mix of methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.\n\nThe plant has a long history of environmental problems, especially fouling the air in communities nearby the sprawling plant.\n\nIn 2018, a Christmas Eve fire damaged pollution-control equipment and led to repeated releases of sulfur dioxide, according to a subsequent lawsuit. The fire prompted Allegheny County to warn residents to limit outdoor activities. Residents said it was hard to breathe for weeks afterward and that the air felt acidic and smelled like rotten eggs. U.S. Steel settled a lawsuit last year with an agreement to spend $19.5 million in equipment upgrades and $5 million on local clean air efforts and programs.\n\nDr. Deborah Gentile, the medical director of Community Partners in Asthma Care, studied asthma levels after the 2018 fire and found twice as many patients sought medical treatment.\n\nIn 2019, U.S. Steel agreed to settle a lawsuit regarding air pollution from Clairton for $8.5 million.\n\nThe concerns about air quality also come as the federal Environmental Protection Agency moves to postpone new hazardous air pollution standards for coke plants, like Clairton.\n\nMatthew Mehalik, executive director of the Breathe Project, a public health advocacy group in Pittsburgh, said the regulations were deemed to be almost insignificant to operational costs and would have helped protect the public with air quality monitoring.\n\nThe regulation would have required \u2014 like is already required at refineries all over the United States \u2014 fence-line monitoring for hazardous air pollutants at the Clairton plant, Mehalik said.\n\nThat information would have been \u201cincredibly useful\u201d when the explosion happened on Monday, Mehalik said.\n\nAssociated Press writer Marc Levy contributed to this report from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",

      "text": "US Steel agrees to spend millions to settle lawsuit over air pollution violations after 2018 fire\nHARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) \u2014 U.S. Steel has agreed to settle a lawsuit that accused the Pittsburgh-based company of violating federal clean air laws by operating plants without its desulfurization controls for more than three months, emitting clouds of sulfurous gas into surrounding towns.\nThe settlement with environmental groups Clean Air Council and PennEnvironment and the Allegheny County Health Department was filed in federal court Monday for a judge to review, the groups said.\nPennEnvironment and the other plaintiffs accused the steel producer of more than 12,000 violations of its air pollution permits.\nUnder the settlement, U.S. Steel is agreeing to spend another $19.5 million in equipment upgrades and $5 million on local clean air efforts and programs. The settlement agreement says U.S. Steel already spent $17.5 million on improvements and upgrades to U.S. Steel\u2019s Mon Valley Works plants after a 2018 Christmas Eve fire that damaged the pollution control equipment.\nThe environmental groups put the value of the settlement at $42 million.\nThe $5 million for clean air efforts and programs is one of the largest-ever penalties nationally in a citizen-enforced lawsuit under federal clean air laws, Clean Air Council and PennEnvironment said.\n\u201cThis historic announcement should send a message to all illegal polluters who put the health and environment of Pittsburghers at risk,\u201d David Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment, said at a news conference Monday. \u201cWe will not sit by while illegal air pollution rains down on nearby communities and the Pennsylvanians who live in them.\u201d\nU.S. Steel said it regretted the \u201caccidental\u201d emissions and that it strives to comply with environmental regulations.\n\u201cWhen we miss that mark, we will make changes so we can do better,\u201d said Kurt Barshick, the company\u2019s Mon Valley Works vice president, said in a statement.\nThe environmental groups sued in 2019, after a Christmas Eve fire at the Clairton coke works plant caused $40 million in damage.\nThe fire damaged pollution control equipment and led to repeated releases of sulfur dioxide, the lawsuit said. Sulfur dioxide is a colorless, pungent byproduct of fossil fuel combustion that can make it hard to breathe.\nIn the wake of the fire, Allegheny County warned residents to limit outdoor activities, with residents saying for weeks afterward that the air felt acidic, smelled like rotten eggs and was hard to breathe.\nThe fire knocked out pollution controls at its Mon Valley plants, but U.S. Steel continued to run them anyway, the groups said.\nThe lawsuit also cited repeated breakdowns at the Clairton plant, including one in 2019 in which the company reported a release of 525,000 pounds of coke oven gas from a pressure release valve.\nU.S. Steel also must permanently close approximately 60 of the worst polluting coke ovens, the groups said. The ovens turn coal into coke, a raw ingredient in the steelmaking process.\n___\nThis story was corrected Jan. 29 to show the number of alleged air pollution permit violations is more than 12,000, instead of more than 1,200. It was also updated Jan. 30 to correct the amount U.S. Steel is agreeing to spend to settle a pollution lawsuit. U.S. Steel is agreeing to spend a total of $24.5 million to settle the lawsuit, not $42 million."

      "text": "Nippon Steel finalizes $15B takeover of US Steel after sealing national security agreement\nNippon Steel finalizes $15B takeover of US Steel after sealing national security agreement\nHARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) \u2014 Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel said Wednesday they have finalized their \u201chistoric partnership,\u201d a deal that gives the U.S. government a say in some matters and comes a year-and-a-half after the Japanese company first proposed its nearly $15 billion buyout of the iconic American steelmaker.\nThe pursuit by Nippon Steel for the Pittsburgh-based company was buffeted by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state, dragging out the transaction for more than a year after U.S. Steel shareholders approved it.\nIt also forced Nippon Steel to expand the deal, including adding a so-called \u201cgolden share\u201d provision that gives the federal government the power to appoint a board member and a say in company decisions that affect domestic steel production and competition with overseas producers.\n\u201cTogether, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel will be a world-leading steelmaker, with best-in-class technologies and manufacturing capabilities,\u201d the companies said.\nThe combined company will become the world\u2019s fourth-largest steelmaker in an industry dominated by the Chinese, and bring what analysts say is Nippon Steel\u2019s top-notch technology to U.S. Steel\u2019s antiquated steelmaking processes, plus a commitment to invest $11 billion to upgrade U.S. Steel facilities.\nIn exchange, Nippon Steel gets access to a robust U.S. steel market, strengthened in recent years by tariffs under President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden, analysts say.\nAnthony Rapa, a Blank Rome lawyer in Washington who advises firms on trade, operations and investments, said the government\u2019s intervention in the Nippon Steel-U.S. Steel deal is another sign of a trend that the U.S. is increasingly equating economic security with national security.\nHe doesn\u2019t see the government\u2019s intervention as chilling foreign investment and said a \u201cgolden share\u201d mechanism \u2014 to the extent it\u2019s used again by the U.S. to ease national security concerns \u2014 is likely to emerge only in sensitive and complex cases.\nStill, the episode could cause investors to be more strategic in how they approach transactions, Rapa said.\nAnil Khurana, executive director of the Baratta Center for Global Business at Georgetown University, said the U.S. government\u2019s interest in the deal is a sign of the growing importance it places on economic competition with China.\n\u201cClearly the definition of what is national security has expanded to included national economic security, which is where I think this comes in,\u201d Khurana said.\nNippon Steel and U.S. Steel did not release a copy of the national security agreement struck with Trump\u2019s administration.\nBut in a statement Wednesday, the companies said the federal government will have the right to appoint an independent director and get \u201cconsent rights\u201d on specific matters.\nThose include reductions in Nippon Steel\u2019s capital commitments in the national security agreement; changing U. S. Steel\u2019s name and headquarters; closing or idling U.S. Steel\u2019s plants; transferring production or jobs outside of the U.S.; buying competing businesses in the U.S.; and certain decisions on trade, labor and sourcing outside the U.S.\nNippon Steel announced in December 2023 that it planned to buy the steel producer for $14.9 billion in cash and debt, and committed to keep the U.S. Steel name and Pittsburgh headquarters.\nThe United Steelworkers union, which represents some U.S. Steel employees, opposed the deal, and Biden and Trump both vowed from the campaign trail to block it.\nBiden used his authority to block Nippon Steel\u2019s acquisition of U.S. Steel on his way out of the White House after a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.\nAfter he was elected, Trump changed course, expressing openness to working out an arrangement and ordering another review by the committee.\nThat\u2019s when the idea of the \u201cgolden share\u201d emerged as a way to resolve national security concerns and protect American interests in domestic steel production.\nAs it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel began adding commitments. Those included putting U.S. Steel under a board made up of a majority of Americans and a management team of Americans.\nIt pledged not to conduct layoffs or plant closings as a result of the transaction or to import steel slabs to compete with U.S. Steel\u2019s blast furnaces in Braddock, Pennsylvania and Gary, Indiana.\nIn the final agreement, it pledged to produce and supply U.S. Steel from domestic sources \u2014 such as mining operations in Minnesota \u2014 and to allow U. S. Steel to pursue trade actions under U.S. law.\nIt also made a series of bigger capital commitments in U.S. Steel facilities, tallying $11 billion through 2028, it said.\nNippon Steel said its annual crude steel production capacity is expected to reach 86 million tons, closer to its goal of 100 million tons.\nThe United Steelworkers on Wednesday noted that its current labor agreement with U.S. Steel expires in 2026.\n\u201cRest assured, if our job security, pensions, retiree health care or other hard-earned benefits are threatened, we are ready to respond with the full strength and solidarity of our membership,\u201d its international president, David McCall, said in a statement.\n___\nFollow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter"

(AP) \u2014 U.S. Steel Corp. has agreed to pay $8.5 million to settle a 2017 class-action lawsuit that accused the steelmaker of negligence in allowing air pollution emissions from its Clairton Coke Works.\nThe proposed agreement was filed in Allegheny County Court and a hearing on it was scheduled for Feb. 24.\nUnder the settlement agreement, U.S. Steel must spend at least $6.5 million to reduce soot emissions and noxious odors from the the Clairton coke-making facility, on the Monongahela River about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Pittsburgh.\nThe remaining $2 million would go to area residents and their lawyers in the case.\nU.S. Steel declined comment.\nThe company, meanwhile, is facing other lawsuits over pollution from the Clairton facility, including ones accusing the company of violating clean air laws after a December 2018 fire damaged the Clairton facility\u2019s sulfur pollution controls.\nU.S. Steel announced earlier this year that it will invest more than $1 billion on state-of-the-art facilities in its western Pennsylvania operations.\nThat includes a new cogeneration facility at its Clairton plant that will feature an emissions control system that can convert some of the coke oven gas generated there into electricity to power other parts of the plant."
