In the years since The Last Five Years premiered \u2014 first at Chicago's Northlight Theatre in 2001, and then, in a 2002 New York City production starring Norbert Leo Butz and Sherie Rene Scott Off-Broadway at the Minetta Lane Theater \u2014 the piece has become a favorite among the musical-theater crowd. Much of that is thanks to the Off-Broadway cast recording, which helped songs from the show like \"Nobody Needs to Know,\" \"Still Hurting,\" \"If I Didn't Believe in You\" and \"The Next Ten Minutes\" become showtune staples. An Off-Broadway revival at New York City's Second Stage Theater came in 2013, with Adam Kantor and Betsy Wolfe in the roles of Jamie and Cathy. A year later, a movie adaptation was released starring Jeremy Jordan and Anna Kendrick. In 2016, a one-night-only concert of the musical was staged at New York City's Town Hall, led by Joshua Henry and Cynthia Erivo. That same year, a production of The Last Five Years opened in London led by Bridgerton and Wicked star Jonathan Bailey and Samantha Barks, a breakout star of the 2012 Les Mis\u00e9rables film.
