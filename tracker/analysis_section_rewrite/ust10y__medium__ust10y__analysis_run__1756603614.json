      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Canonical Handle Mapping** – Every substantive claim must link to a canonical handle. Add explicit references such as `spx` for the S&P 500, `us_cpi` for inflation, `us_employment` for labor data, `fed_policy` for Fed actions, and `us_tariffs` for tariff‑driven price pressures. For example, replace “the Fed may cut rates in September” with “Fed policy (fed_policy) is expected to cut rates by 25–50 bp in September (Sept 5 payrolls)”.  \n2. **Quantification & Sources** – Provide numeric ranges and cite the article (ID FAN5RYW6T) and any external data (e.g., CPI 2.7 % YoY, PCE 2.9 % YoY). State the concentration metric: “Top‑10 stocks now comprise 40 % of spx (FAN5RYW6T)”.  \n3. **Catalyst Windows** – Clearly mark the 3–6 month horizon. Use a table or bullet list:  \n   - **Sept 5** – U.S. payrolls (us_employment) → Fed policy (fed_policy) → spx.  \n   - **Q2 2025 earnings** – Tech earnings (spx) → spx.  \n   - **Tariff announcements** – us_tariffs → spx.  \n4. **Scenario Structure** – Distinguish base case, alt 1, alt 2 with explicit magnitude ranges:  \n   - **Base**: spx falls 3–6 % if tech earnings weaken, labor market remains soft, and Fed cuts are delayed.  \n   - **Alt 1**: spx gains 1–2 % if tech earnings hold and Fed cuts 25–50 bp in September.  \n   - **Alt 2**: spx declines 8–10 % if tariffs spike and inflation remains sticky.  \n5. **Risk & Invalidation** – List risks as bullet points with causal links:  \n   - Tech earnings deterioration → spx decline.  \n   - Fed reluctance to cut → higher term premium → spx pressure.  \n   - Tariff escalation → higher CPI → spx drag.  \n6. **Watch‑List Signals** – Add specific indicators: Q2 earnings releases of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia; Fed minutes (Sept 12); tariff updates (e.g., steel, aluminum).  \n7. **Confidence Rating** – Quantify confidence (e.g., “moderate (≈60 %)”) and explain dependence on path‑dependent variables.  \n8. **Remove Drift** – The draft is focused on spx, but any mention of “US stock market” should be mapped to `spx`. Ensure no generic statements (“market rally”) appear without a handle.  \n\nImplement these edits to meet the Argos standards: truth > verbosity, explicit mapping, catalyst windows, quantified ranges, and concise, actionable guidance.",
