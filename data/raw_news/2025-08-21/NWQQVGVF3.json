  "description": "Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launches August 28, 2025, with Unreal Engine 5 visuals, new controls, and special editions for hardcore fans.",
  "content": "Every Metal Gear game\u2013even Metal Gear Survive\u2013has a special place in my heart. While Survive didn't have Hideo Kojima's hands-on direction, it is still a concept born from the ingenious original and the even better sequel, Metal Gear Solid. I'll never forget Psycho Mantis.\n\nAnother classic Metal Gear is headed our way in the form of a remastered remake. It's Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. The remake is called Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and here's everything you need to know about the game.\n\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launches on August 28, 2025, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam. The Tactical Espionage Action classic returns as a complete remake, rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 designed to deliver expansive environments, real-time battle damage, and expressive facial animations.\n\nPlayers will once again step into the role of Naked Snake, navigating Cold War-era jungles while facing betrayal and survival-driven missions. Konami promises an experience that is akin to the original with expansions and new nuggets.\n\nThe story, characters, and voice acting remain intact, while combat is enhanced with a new battle damage system where Snake\u2019s injuries and clothing reflect the player\u2019s journey in real time. The remake also introduces an optional modern control scheme alongside the classic style, giving players the ability to experience stealth gameplay the way it was in the original or with a more modern controller setting.\n\nFour purchase options will be available. You can divide them into two categories: physical and digital.\n\nThe physical options are the Tactical and Collector\u2019s Edition. The Tactical Edition ($69.99) adds the Sneaking DLC Pack and a White Tuxedo uniform as an early purchase bonus. For hardcore fans, the Collector\u2019s Edition ($199.99) bundles the Tactical Edition with physical extras like a terrarium diorama of Snake\u2019s iconic Virtuous Mission tree, replica FOX Unit patches, a retro-style metal game case, and a lanyard ID badge.\n\nThe game also comes with bonus content like \u201cSnake vs Monkey\u201d on PlayStation and \u201cSnake vs Bomberman\u201d on Xbox, as well as the new \u201cFox Hunt\u201d online multiplayer mode arriving Fall 2025. In addition, collectible 8mm film canisters unlock humorous \u201cSecret Theater\u201d clips, offering a playful twist on iconic scenes.\n\nThe digital versions are the Standard and Digital Deluxe.\n\nThe Standard Edition includes the base game, while The Digital Deluxe Edition offers everything the Collector\u2019s Edition does except for the physical items. Users will also get 48 hours early access if they pre-order.\n\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - Is it Worth Your Time and Money?\n\nThe biggest question when it comes to video game remakes is: what's new? While you may have loved playing the original, what's going to entice me to take this journey again? And, is it worth paying $69.99 for the Tactical Edition or Standard, $79.99 for the Digital Deluxe or even $199.99 for the Collector's Edition?\n\nI'd say the CE should be reserved for absolute fanatics who can say Kojima and/or Solid Snake inspired on a special level.\n\nThe Tactical Edition seems to pack a significant punch and with the improved visuals, newness to overall experience makes it totally worth the $69.99 if you need a physical version.\n\nIf you fall somewhere in between and don\u2019t need the physical items, the Digital Deluxe Edition for $79.99 will do you just fine. The standard works, but something tells me you\u2019re going to want to get in on the DLC at some point, and you\u2019ll have to pay extra for it down the road.\n\nI\u2019d pay the extra $10 now and be done with it. It\u2019s Metal Gear.",

      "text": "There are some weird takes on the new Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 and that somehow Konami hasn\u2019t done right by these games. That\u2019s just plain wrong.\nThe main complaint seems to be that the HD remasters of Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3 don\u2019t support high enough resolutions on PC. Furthermore, when you mod the games to force higher resolutions, things start to break.\nThe HD remasters were originally done by Bluepoint, who really know their stuff when it comes to remaking classic games. Especially those that were released on the PlayStation 2.\nThe latter is a key point, as the PlayStation 2 era of Metal Gear Solid used all manner of artistic trickery to get more out of the hardware. However, these graphical workarounds weren\u2019t intended to be scaled up at a later date.\nThat means instead of changing a great deal of the backend to get something similar but probably not as good, these HD ports capped the resolution to retain most of the graphical gimmicks.\nSo keeping these games intact is actually the right approach here, otherwise trying to make strange and pretty bespoke hacks to work on modern PCs would likely break more than it fixed.\nThis is often a trade off in development and Bluepoint made the right call to keep these games as close to how they were intended.\nFinally, one additional gripe is that these games don\u2019t work well with mouse and keyboard. That may be true, but again they were never meant to be played on a mouse and keyboard.\nThere are plenty of excellent PC pads available, with the recent wireless 8BitDo effort coming highly recommended at only $69.99.\nProtecting our collective gaming history is crucially important, but that also means that some games need to remain a certain way even on modern hardware.\nInconvenient as that may be, that\u2019s how these games will work best. Personally, I am just glad we have Metal Gear Solid: Integral finally released outside of Japan, but that may just be me.\nMetal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 is now available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, PC and Switch.\nFollow me on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. I also manage Mecha Damashii and do toy reviews over at hobbylink.tv.\nRead my Forbes blog here."
