  "content": "This Easy Lavender Lemonade Is the Summer Drink You\u2019ll Want to Sip on Repeat originally appeared on Parade.\n\nDown here in Texas, where I live, it has been heatwave central. I\u2019m talking about 100-degree weather for days on end. If you, too, are suffering through unreasonably high temperatures this summer, I\u2019ve got the perfect thing to cool you down: lavender lemonade.\n\nLavender and lemons are a flavor pairing made in heaven. Lavender is the perfect way to add a bit of oomph to a classic lemonade. The floral notes from the lavender play so well off of the lemon\u2019s acidity. Lavender lemonade is also an easy way to impress guests if you\u2019re hosting because it feels special but doesn\u2019t require too much effort. Garnish your glasses with a sprig of lavender, and you\u2019ve got a picture-perfect party drink.\n\nAre you ready to give this fun twist on the classic summer drink a try? Read on for all you need to know.\n\nRelated: The Algerian Way to Make Lemonade 10x Better\n\nChoosing the Right Lavender for Lavender Lemonade\n\nWith so many different varieties of lavender out there, it\u2019s not always clear which kinds you use in the kitchen and which kinds are best used in a bar of soap. While almost all lavender is edible, you definitely don\u2019t want to use all lavender varieties in your cooking.\n\nCulinary lavender is typically from Lavandula angustifolia plants, which is commonly known as English lavender. It has far less oils than other lavender plants, which means you won\u2019t feel like you\u2019re drinking body wash.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, English lavender or French lavender should be your go-to\u2019s when cooking in the kitchen. These two are the most common lavender plants, and they are both sweet and relatively mild in their floral taste compared to other types of lavender.\n\nRelated: The Brazilian Way to Make Lemonade 10x Better\n\n\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b SIGN UP to get delicious recipes, handy kitchen hacks & more in our daily Pop Kitchen newsletter. \ud83c\udf73\ud83c\udf54\n\nIf you're looking for inspiration, there are tons of lavender lemonade recipes online (including the lovely one from @modhippiehabits that you see above). You can scroll social media to see which variation you might like best, but the process is really quite easy.\n\nFirst, you will need to make a lavender syrup. Pick the flowers off the stems and combine them in a bowl with sugar. Rub them together gently with your fingers\u2014this helps release the oils.\n\nNext, bring a small pot of water to a boil and stir in the lavender sugar until dissolved. Let the syrup cool for an hour so it can soak up all that floral flavor, then strain it into a small jar or bowl.\n\nNext, make your favorite lemonade recipe or pick up a bottle of your go-to store-bought lemonade. You can add the lavender syrup (taste as you go) to a big batch of lemonade or serve the lemonade and lavender syrup separately so guests can add the syrup to their drink to taste.\n\nFor the perfect finishing touch, garnish the drink with lemon wedges or wheels and a sprig of lavender.\n\nRelated: The Italian Way to Make Lemonade 10x Better\n\nHow Much Lavender Should I Use to Make Lavender Lemonade?\n\nWhen using lavender to cook or make drinks, my suggestion is to think of it like a spice. You want to use it sparingly enough that it doesn\u2019t overpower the brightness of the lemons. Let me tell you from experience, a little lavender goes a very long way. When you're mixing up your drink, add some syrup, taste, then add more if needed.\n\nRelated: The Midwestern Trick for the Fastest & Best-Ever Homemade Lemonade\n\nStart with equal parts lemon juice and sugar syrup, and add double or triple the amount of water. Taste and adjust as needed\u2014add more water if it\u2019s too strong or more sugar if it needs sweetness.\n\nRemember, if you add ice to your lemonade pitcher, it will dilute the drink as it melts. Factor this in when you\u2019re giving your lemonade a taste test.\n\nUse it up\n\nStash any leftover lavender syrup in the fridge (it will keep for about a week) and use it to make more lemonade, sweeten iced, hot tea or cocktails or drizzle some over vanilla ice cream.\n\nRelated: The Egyptian Way to Make Lemonade 10x Better\n\nThis Easy Lavender Lemonade Is the Summer Drink You\u2019ll Want to Sip on Repeat first appeared on Parade on Aug 11, 2025\n\nThis story was originally reported by Parade on Aug 11, 2025, where it first appeared.",
