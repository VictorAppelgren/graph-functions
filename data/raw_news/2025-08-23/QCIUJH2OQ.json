Anyone who commits an act of aggression against a country in Latin America is attacking all countries,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Justice Department has accused Maduro of leading \u201cThe Cartel de los Soles,\u201d which shipped hundreds of tons of cocaine and other illicit drugs to the US since the early 2000s, raking in millions.\n\nIn July, they listed the cartel as a specially designated global terrorist group.",

      "text": "White House nixed visit with freed Venezuela detainee Joseph St. Clair over outstanding arrest warrants for drug possession, DWI\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Secret Service rejected a request to bring an American detainee freed from Venezuelan custody to the White House last week \u2014 because they would have had to arrest him on the spot due to outstanding warrants, The Post has learned.\nJoseph St. Clair, 32, an Afghanistan war veteran who had been held in the South American country since this past November, has a record in his home state of Texas, the Ellis County Sheriff\u2019s Office confirmed Tuesday.\nSt. Clair, of Austin, was arrested in June 2023 on three counts of drug possession, resisting arrest, and driving while intoxicated. A little more than a year later, in July 2024, St. Clair was booked again on a DWI charge.\nA report from the Waxahachie Police Department on the June 2023 incident claimed that arresting officers pulled St. Clair over after he was driving erratically on Interstate 35 and reported a white powdery substance on his nose. A search of St. Clair\u2019s truck revealed \u201cat least a dozen\u201d baggies of ketamine or ketamine residue \u2014 some of which he admitted to snorting before he left his house \u2014 and two vials of anabolic steroids.\nThe arresting officers noted that St. Clair had also been picked up on a DWI rap in April 2023, a case which was pending at the time of his apprehension.\nThe request to bring St. Clair to the White House was put in by special envoy Ric Grenell, who flew to the Caribbean island of Antigua on a private jet to pick up the freed American May 20, as The Post reported Friday.\nUpon his return to Washington, Grenell asked Trump if he could bring St. Clair by the executive mansion for a celebration, as has been done with other freed US detainees.\nThe request was initially approved, but was then shut down after the Secret Service learned of St. Clair\u2019s criminal history, according to multiple sources.\n\u201cHe [Grenell] was told no by Secret Service who alerted for White House staff that if this individual were to (come) to the White House, he would be arrested at the gate because of his outstanding warrants,\u201d said one administration official.\n\u201cWhy the hell would we ever allow that to happen and embarrass the president?\u201d\nThere is no evidence Grenell was aware of St. Clair\u2019s legal trouble. The special envoy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe White House has yet to release a statement about St. Clair\u2019s return \u2014 despite just two weeks earlier highlighting four other Americans released from overseas captivity since Trump took office Jan. 20.\nGrenell\u2019s trip to fetch St. Clair caught many in the administration by surprise, with one informed source saying last week the envoy had \u201cblindsided the president and the White House.\u201d\nA second administration official said Tuesday that Grenell briefly informed Trump of his plan to bring back St. Clair, but confirmed that the White House and State Department were unaware of any travel plans.\n\u201cThere is a process, protocol and chain of command, especially in the context of high-stakes diplomacy,\u201d a source close to the administration warned. \u201cIntentionally bypassing the secretary of state, blindsiding the White House and misleading the president isn\u2019t just reckless, it\u2019s damaging.\n\u201cNo one gets to play pretend for the job they wanted. You must execute in good faith within the role you\u2019re actually in.\u201d\nOn the same day Grenell retrieved St. Clair, he claimed on former White House strategist Steve Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast that Trump would extend a May 27 deadline for Chevron to leave Venezuela by an additional 60 days after Maduro showed willingness to work with the White House by releasing St. Clair.\nChevron was instead offered a license to keep up essential maintenance on its $7 billion worth of equipment in Venezuela, but it will not be allowed to use the equipment to pump oil for sale.\nTrump is also keeping in place 25% tariffs on any country that imports Venezuelan oil.\n\u201cGeneral License 41B has expired, and Chevron\u2019s continued presence in Venezuela remains in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including the sanctions framework provided for by the US government,\u201d Chevron spokesman Bill Turenne told The Post in an emailed statement."

Yet Maduro\u2019s reign of terror continues,\u201d Bondi said.\n\u201cHe is one of the largest narco traffickers in the world, and a threat to our national security,\u201d she added.\nBondi vowed that \u201cunder President Trump\u2019s leadership, Maduro will not escape justice, and he will be held accountable for his despicable crimes.\u201d"

      "text": "Trump Venezuela envoy Ric Grenell in hot water over unapproved jet trip to pick up US detainee\nPresident Trump\u2019s special envoy Ric Grenell \u201cblindsided\u201d administration officials earlier this week by taking a private jet to Antigua without prior authorization to pick up an American held for the past six months by Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, The Post can exclusively reveal.\nGrenell announced Tuesday that he had flown to Antigua to bring Air Force veteran Joe St. Clair back to the United States, posting a picture of the two winging it back to Washington, DC.\nWhile the 58-year-old notified Trump in a brief conversation that he was traveling to fetch a detainee, key details of the trip were omitted and other officials \u2014 including senior White House aides \u2014 were not told at all.\n\u201cGrenell blindsided the president and the White House,\u201d an informed administration source told The Post.\nRecords obtained by The Post indicate the jet used by Grenell is registered in Florida to Bill Stone, chairman and CEO of Windsor, Conn.-based SS&C Technologies. Attempts to contact Stone were not immediately successful Friday.\nInsiders believe Grenell\u2019s trip was a Hail Mary attempt to pressure Trump to extend Chevron\u2019s license to import Venezuelan oil \u2014 which is set to expire May 27, Secretary of State Marco Rubio reaffirmed Wednesday on X.\nThe envoy\u2019s freelancing briefly threatened House passage of the president\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d with three South Florida Republicans \u2014 Reps. Mario D\u00edaz-Balart, Mar\u00eda Elvira Salazar and Carlos Gim\u00e9nez \u2014 refusing to give their backing if the Chevron license was extended, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.\nThe congressional drama was first reported Friday by Axios, and the bill ultimately cleared the House 215-214, with all three Floridians voting \u201cyea.\u201d\nIn February, Trump revoked all licenses to operate US-based businesses in Venezuela, expressing frustration with Maduro, whose government declared him the winner of last year\u2019s presidential election without releasing vote tallies or otherwise providing proof.\n\u201cWe are hereby reversing the concessions that Crooked Joe Biden gave to Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, of Venezuela, on the oil transaction agreement, dated November 26, 2022, and also having to do with Electoral conditions within Venezuela, which have not been met by the Maduro regime,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social on Feb. 26.\n\u201cAdditionally, the regime has not been transporting the violent criminals that they sent into our Country (the Good Ole\u2019 U.S.A.) back to Venezuela at the rapid pace that they had agreed to,\u201d he added.\nOn March 24, the president doubled down, issuing an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on any country that imports Venezuelan oil.\nAhead of Grenell\u2019s Caribbean jaunt on Tuesday, he claimed on former White House strategist Steve Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast that Trump would extend the May 27 deadline an additional 60 days after Maduro showed willingness to work with the White House by releasing St. Clair.\n\u201cPresident Trump authorized that extension if, if we were able to get some progress, if we were able to build some confidence, if we were able to do that today,\u201d Grenell told Bannon. \u201cSo that extension will be granted.\u201d\nGrenell also talked up Chevron\u2019s presence in Venezuela, telling Bannon: \u201cWe want to put America first and do what\u2019s best for America. That means making sure that the Chinese do not take the Venezuelan oil.\u201d\nThe envoy\u2019s statement caused widespread confusion, with reporters on Thursday asking State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce to \u201cexplain the discrepancy.\u201d\n\u201cThe secretary \u2026 put up a tweet making it clear where we stand on Chevron, which is a license which is due to expire in May,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I will speak to is not what others have said, but certainly the people who are in charge of the nature of what we are doing, and that is Secretary Rubio, making it clear that that license is going to expire.\u201d\n\u201cSo there\u2019s no confusion. I think many people on every issue can have a lot of opinions, but I think clearly who we look to are the people who have the power to have the impact and who make the decision, and of course this is at the direction of President Trump, as well.\u201d\nThe State Department told The Post in a statement Wednesday that the \u201cBiden-era oil and gas licenses \u2026 benefitted Maduro\u2019s regime and lined the pockets of his cronies,\u201d explaining that the administration would continue to \u201cdeny any funding the Maduro regime uses to oppress the Venezuelan people. \u201d\n\u201cThis termination executes on the President\u2019s directive and cuts off financial lifelines for a regime that has consistently stolen elections, pillaged from its people, and colluded with our enemies.\u201d\nGrenell, who had sought the secretary of state position before Trump selected Rubio, did not respond to a request for comment.\nAdditional reporting by James Franey.\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to clarify that President Trump was notified by Grenell of his May 20 travel, though other key officials were not."

But she wasn\u2019t missing at all, she left to go live with these people,\u201d Taylor\u2019s aunt Vandora Skinner told The Independent.\n\u201cIt is very stressful, and difficult. It breaks our heart. We\u2019re overly concerned about Kaura, but she doesn\u2019t think anyone is concerned about her,\u201d her other aunt Teri Allen told the outlet.\nDistraught relatives discovered the 21-year-old\u2019s secret life only after she disappeared and left them a cryptic message saying she and her daughter \u201chad to get out and explore a little bit.\u201d\nAllen revealed her niece\u2019s childhood was \u201cvery sheltered and protected.\u201d\n\u201cShe was brought up in church, but not their religion. Not this thing that they got going. It\u2019s a bunch of hogwash,\u201d Allen told the outlet.\nTaylor was living with Skinner when she connected with the \u201ckingdom\u201d in 2023, allegedly discovering the Facebook group of the \u201cKingdom of Kubala\u201d through a high school classmate.\nThe single mother began talking with King Atehene, whose real name is Kofi Offeh \u2013 an opera singer from Ghana and his wife and mother of seven Jean Gasho, now known as Queen Nandi.\nTaylor, who serves as Queen Nandi\u2019s handmaiden, claimed she escaped Texas because of her abusive family.\n\u201cYes I\u2019m very happy with my King and Queen, I was never missing, I fled a very abusive, toxic family who abused me sexually since I was a child! So you don\u2019t go \u2018missing\u2019 to your abusers,\u201d Taylor said in a Facebook post on Aug. 20.\nThe \u201ckingdom\u201d claims to be a part of a lost Hebrew Tribe who returned to Scotland to reclaim the land their ancestors had stolen from them over 400 years ago, when Queen Elizabeth I \u201cdeported all black people from Scotland and England,\u201d Queen Nandi, whose real name is Jean Gasho, said.\nTaylor attempted to relocate to the land 40 miles south of Edinburgh with her then boyfriend, but he was scared off by the couple\u2019s \u201cungodly rituals,\u201d according to The Independent.\nAfter disappearing, Taylor relayed a message to her family\nShe kept the secret hidden from her family back home up until she disappeared.\n\u201cShe said she would have to call me when she got connected to wifi, but then I never heard from her again,\u201d Skinner said.\nThe tribe claims to live a simple life by bathing in a nearby stream, living in tents and connecting with nature, also has a prominent presence on social media, sharing multiple online and print news articles of their group to their accounts..\nTaylor\u2019s social media posts allowed her family to investigate the \u201cking and queen,\u201d revealing Offeh and Gasho had set up a living situation with another American woman, Skinner told the outlet.\nThe young woman, who isn\u2019t legally married to Offeh, calls herself his second wife and allows the \u201cking\u201d to have \u201cas many wives as he wants.\u201d\nScottish Borders Council said it had been \u201cworking with Police Scotland\u201d to manage Taylor and the tribe\u2019s ongoing situation, according to SWNS.\n\u201cThis has included the provision of advice and information about housing options and other support services,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nTaylor\u2019s family hopes she returns to Texas when her six-month visa expires in November.\nwith Post wires"

      "text": "6 severed heads found by side of the road along with chilling message in one of Mexico\u2019s safest regions\nSix severed heads have been found by the side of the road in Mexico alongside a chilling message in an area where such brutal violence is rare, Mexican prosecutors said.\nThe male remains were discovered by a road linking the central Mexican states of Puebla and Tlaxcala, prosecutors said on Tuesday.\nAlongside the heads was a pamphlet blaming the savage killings on the settling of scores between rival gangs, the prosecutor\u2019s office said in a statement.\n\u201cThe State Attorney General\u2019s Office (FGJE) has initiated an investigation into the discovery of six male head limbs near the states of Puebla and Tlaxcala,\u201d the office said as it announced an inquiry into the murders.\n\u201cThe State Attorney General\u2019s Office will continue the relevant investigations to clarify what happened and hold accountable whoever is found responsible,\u201d the statement concluded.\nBoth Puebla and Tlaxcala are usually considered among the safest states in Mexico to visit, with the US State Department designating them a Level 2 travel advisory, the second-lowest warning.\nTlaxcala accounts for just 0.5% of the 14,769 intentional homicides recorded in Mexico this year so far, while Puebla accounts for 3.4%, according to official figures.\nHowever, the State Department notes that both states face issues with criminal gangs that move drugs, fuel and humans through central Mexico.\nExtreme violence \u2014 including decapitation \u2014 is usually concentrated around northern and western states along the Pacific coast.\nIn June, 20 bodies, five of them headless, were discovered under a bridge along a road in northwest Sinaloa.\nHowever, there have been more gruesome crimes in southern Mexico in recent months.\nIn March, the dismembered bodies of nine missing students were found by the side of a highway on the border of Puebla and Oaxaca.\nA bag of hands belonging to the students was discovered nearby."

Trump has intensified pressure on Maduro, offering a $50\u202fmillion bounty, revoking oil licenses, imposing tariffs, and the DOJ has seized assets and charged him with drug trafficking. Special envoy Ric\u202fGrenell secretly flew to Antigua to retrieve former detainee Joseph St.\u202fClair, a move that raised security concerns and highlighted internal White House friction over policy on Venezuela and Chevron. The article also briefly covers unrelated stories, including a derelict Scottish castle, a Texas woman living with a self\u2011proclaimed \u201ckingdom\u201d in Scotland, and a shocking discovery of severed heads in Mexico\u2019s Puebla and Tlaxcala states.",
