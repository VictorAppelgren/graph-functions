  "title": "Apple Needs to Do an AI Acquisition, Says Dan Ives",
  "description": "Wedbush Head of Tech Research Dan Ives says Apple is so far behind in artificial intelligence development that it needs to make an acquisition to catch up. Ives joins Caroline Hyde and Ed Ludlow on \u201cBloomberg Tech.\u201d (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Marc's reporting moves the needle. Right. We know that this tabletop robot will be the centerpiece on the hardware side. We know that Siri will be made more lifelike. Has this changed things for you, Dan, in what you're modeling for Apple and the kind of comeback that many think the Apple needs to have in the air domain? But given their age, our strategy has been a disaster. And, you know, it's if you look at every other big tech company, you know, Apple is massively behind. And I think when you look at this as a potential opportunity, I think Street is basically shrug their shoulders. I mean, robotics, Apple's going to come out with another device will cook it open. I look at Microsoft look at matter. I mean it speaks to our view right now. It's an F1 racer, Monza. It's all passed in there by an apple and cook or watching from a park bench, drinking a cappuccino. That's actually a really interesting, I think, maybe veiled reference to WW DC, which opened up with the F1 sequence, if you remember. Then that puts the emphasis back on Siri. What how much better do Siri need to be then if it is to be a tool used daily by technology users around the world in the same way that chat is an app on my iPhone. Book, which is calling it is like Siri. Nothing's going to happen internally. I mean, internally, this has been a disaster. If you go back to David David, DC, it felt like Michael J. Fox Back to the Future Moment 2016. They continue to promise what's on that come what's next? They're going to have to do an acquisition. I mean, look, it's just it's the reality of the situation. It's not happening internally and there's no one on the street that believes any innovation is coming out of Apple when it comes to A.I. organically. Dan, you still got an outperform and a $270 price target on Apple. You're sounding way more cautious than your money perspective is leading us yet. Look, to get 2 to 70 is no I. This is a stock that's going to move higher and even saw what happened last week with the tariffs. Cook obviously playing nice in the sandbox with Trump. That was a huge relief and the stocks had to move. And I think the stock that good add to 74 potentially to 80 without a I. But for this to be a three 5400 $450 stock a day and it's not happening internally. And I think that's the problem that the street has is that things like robotics next gen A 3000 by 4000. It's all about software it and it comes down to like they need to ascension and we've talked about perplexity other acquisitions are going to have to do it's not happening internally that's just the reality. What's interesting, Dan, is the notes you have been putting out, for example, today have been more around, as you just said, there was a relief when Tim Cook was alongside President Trump last week. Well, this week it's all been about what President Trump has meant for in video of AMD and for paying to play. What do you make of the moves that we've seen and to gain access in China? Look, it speaks to I mean, you know, a godfather could, right? I mean, it's a deal you can't refuse. And I think the reality is, is that big tech CEOs are learning the new rules of the game. Now, of course, the word godfather of agents and Nvidia. They need to do a 15%. Yeah, it's bread crumbs relative to getting into a China market. They can't give this to far in a silver platter. And I view it as bullish and it's going to put more fuel in the engine of this around. Then super quickly, we broke the story last week that Dojo is no more at Tesla and Musk has come out on x ray and kind of explained it. The focus on AI five and six, the How did you react to that? I don't think I saw a no. And what do you think about the stopgap between those generations of custom silicon? Yeah. Now the great story that you guys broke, I mean, I view it as this is to me, it's more certainty that they're going to have a massive investment the next day that will come at the shareholder meeting. But it speaks to our view to Tesla stock lifting. I think more and more recognizing this is going to be a holistic strategy. Tesla exec It's all about autonomous and robotics, and I think that was if you got to read through the tea leaves that that was my view.",

  "summary": "Apple's strategy towards AI (A.I.I., or AI) is perceived as a weakness compared to other big tech companies like Microsoft and Apple, as Dan Ives argues. He argues that the company's strategy has been a failure and that it is not happening internally. He also suggests that an acquisition for Siri, which is designed to be a tool used daily by technology users, could be a significant opportunity. Despite this, Ives remains cautious about Apple's potential to add to 74 potentially to 80 without a I. However, he remains hopeful about the potential acquisition. Ives also commented on the recent developments in China and the potential for Tesla to gain access to the market. He suggests that the move towards AI is bullish and will fuel the growth of the industry.",
  "shortSummary": "Dan Ives emphasizes that Apple needs to make Siri Siri more lifelike and adopt an AI acquisition to recover from internal failures and compete with tech giants like Apple and Tesla.",
