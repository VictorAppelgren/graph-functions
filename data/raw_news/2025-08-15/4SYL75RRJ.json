  "content": "Two-thirds of American consumers are cutting back on discretionary spending as tariff concerns reshape retail landscapes ahead of the critical back-to-school and holiday seasons. Middle-income suburbanites are now joining traditionally price-sensitive lower-income households in the high-concern zone. Retailers face a fundamental shift that threatens discretionary categories from apparel to home d\u00e9cor while creating opportunities for value-focused retailers in the discount and warehouse club sectors.\n\nThe shift represents more than typical inflation concerns. Despite only 38% of consumers expecting tariffs to negatively impact them personally, widespread behavioral changes are already underway. \"This indicates a preemptive behavioral shift driven by expectations of higher prices rather than actual price changes,\" stated Aditya Kaushik, analyst for Coresight Research. The disconnect between perception and direct impact signals a consumer psychology that could reshape retail performance through the fourth quarter.\n\nWhile the (CPI) showed a slower rise in prices for July at 0.2% compared to June's 0.3%, the underlying pressures on consumer budgets continue to mount. On a rolling 12-month basis ending July 2025, food and shelter costs have surged 2.7% and 3.7% respectively, while energy services, including utilities and electricity, spiked 7.2% year-over-year. Though gasoline prices declined 9.5%, the essential category directly impacts discretionary spending power. Commodities, less food and energy, rose 3.1% year-over-year, setting the stage for back-to-school and holiday purchasing decisions driven by reduced discretionary capacity.\n\nThe most striking shift in consumer behavior is not coming from traditionally price-sensitive lower-income households but emerging from middle-income suburbanites who typically drive holiday spending. Sixty-six percent of consumers state they will spend less this year, with two-thirds of affected consumers cutting back on discretionary purchases across apparel, beauty, home d\u00e9cor, and department store sectors.\n\n\"Traditionally, tariff and inflation shocks are assumed to disproportionately affect lower-income households, but our data shows middle-income suburbanites are now in the high-concern zone,\" stated Kaushik. This demographic shift requires retailers to recalibrate segmentation models and treat these households as at risk for reduced discretionary spending. \"It is not about abandoning premium lines, but it is about creating a ladder of options that keeps middle-income shoppers engaged instead of trading out to competitors.\"\n\nMany retailers have not issued widespread price increases on products that were brought into the country before tariffs took effect. However, going into the third and fourth quarters of this year, many retailer have to raise their prices, creating a complex supply chain dynamic that will intensify through the fourth quarter.\n\n\"When Trump announced his world wide assault on global trade in early April, importers and retailers, faced with the tariffs their arriving goods would be burdened with, did one of two things: they accelerated receipt of merchandise inbound to the U.S., to avoid impending tariffs, and, in some cases, they held arrival of goods off not knowing what actual tariff rates would be imposed,\" explains Mark A. Cohen, former director of Retail Studies at Columbia Business School. However, going into the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year, starting with August back-to-school shopping, shoppers may experience broad price increases across categories as this inventory buffer diminishes.\n\nLarger retailers have responded to consumer price sensitivity by aggressively expanding private label options, with Costco leading the charge through its Kirkland Signature brand strategy. The private label powerhouse now accounts for 30% of Costco's annual sales, with Kirkland Signature sales growth outpacing overall company performance.\n\n\"We continue to move more Kirkland Signature product sourcing into the countries or regions where the items are sold, and this has helped bring us to lower costs and mitigate some of the potential impacts of tariffs,\" explained Costco CEO Ron Vachris in the most recent third-quarter earnings call. The strategy is delivering results: Costco experienced an 8% increase in net sales from the prior year's third quarter, with membership income up 10.4% year-over-year, demonstrating how private label can serve as both a consumer value proposition and a margin protection strategy.\n\nA growing consumer demand for Made in America products has emerged in survey data, with shoppers expressing increased interest in domestically produced goods. While this trend may appear to present a market opportunity for retailers considering local sourcing strategies, the gap between consumer intent and actual purchasing behavior remains significant. \"Intent does not always equal spend,\" cautions Kaushik. Retailers looking to capitalize on patriotic purchasing sentiment need concrete evidence of conversion. \"To separate real demand from aspirational sentiment, retailers should test-and-learn with controlled product rollouts, introducing American-made lines in select stores and tracking conversion, repeat purchases, and price elasticity,\" said Kaushik. The key is determining whether Made in America products drive consistent purchasing patterns or represent mere signaling of patriotic sentiment.\n\nHoliday Strategy Shifts Toward Value and Early Engagement\n\nThe traditional holiday shopping landscape faces a fundamental reset as consumer anxiety drives both earlier purchasing decisions and heightened price sensitivity. In anticipation of higher prices, 53% of survey respondents have modified their shopping behavior through three key strategies: cutting back on luxuries and non-essentials, increasing demand for American-made goods, and stockpiling before anticipated price rises, particularly among men, urban, and high-income groups. \"We expect an early, deal-driven holiday season with sharper competition for every discretionary dollar. Off-price, mass merchandisers, and warehouse clubs will likely outperform due to their value for money deals, while weakness will remain in department stores and some specialty apparel retailers unless they aggressively target value perceptions,\" said Kaushik. The shift is already impacting retailer policies as announced it will end its price matching of products sold for less at competitors' stores and websites. \"Retailers should prioritize value-packed products and doorbuster events starting early and market to high-income households that still have discretionary capacity,\" explains Kaushik.\n\nThe convergence of anxiety and inflation reality is forcing retailers to fundamentally recalibrate their customer segmentation models. With middle-income suburbanites, traditionally the backbone of discretionary spending, now exhibiting price-sensitive behaviors, successful retailers must create product assortments with choices in a variety of price points rather than abandoning premium positioning entirely. The winners in this environment will be those who recognize that 2025's holiday season begins with back-to-school results, using early performance data to adjust value messaging and promotional intensity before the critical fourth quarter arrives.",

      "text": "Target ends longtime price-matching policy: What to know\nTarget began price matching back in 2013.\nTarget has ended its price matching of products sold for less at its competitors' stores and websites.\nFor 12 years, Target customers who found a product that was sold for less on Amazon or Walmart's websites could request to buy the same product that was sold at a Target store at the lower price.\nAs of Monday, the Minnesota-based retailer ended its longtime \"Price Match Guarantee\" policy, removing the price match with competitors and only keeping the match for products with price differences that were sold in Target stores and on Target's website.\nAccording to Target's website, an item may qualify for a price match now only \"if it's an eligible Target product, bought from Target today, or in the past 14 days. It must be an identical item, brand name, size, weight, color, quantity and model number and the price is lower from Target.com or your local Target store.\"\nTarget first introduced its \"Price Match\" policy in 2013, becoming the first brick-and-mortar retail chain to launch price matching of products, often sold for cheaper online.\nThe change at the time was supposed to be a permanent update.\n\"We've found our guests overwhelmingly price match Target and not other retailers, which reflects the great value and trust in pricing consumers see across our assortment and deals,\" a Target spokesperson told ABC News in a statement on July 21, when the change in the retailer's price match policy was first announced.\nTarget's sales have recently taken a hit, with the chain retailer reporting May a sizable decrease in its first quarter earnings, down from $24.5 billion in the first quarter of 2024 to $23.8 billion in the first quarter of 2025.\nAt the time, the retail giant said customers weren't shopping as much in its stores and cited a backlash to Target ending corporate diversity initiatives and uncertainty amid tariff increases.\nIn comparison, competitor Walmart reported steady sales with a 4.5% growth in the U.S. and 21% growth in its e-commerce business."

      "text": "After a summer of rapid-fire tariff announcements, the U.S. trade picture is shifting in ways that will reshape holiday and beyond.\nThe cascade began with the sweeping \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff in April, which applies to virtually all imported goods, with rates varying 10-50% by trading partner. On top of this universal baseline, Washington has layered targeted surcharges on categories such as autos, steel and aluminum, and copper, along with country-specific moves that will raise India\u2019s overall rate to 50% on Aug.27. A 90-day extension of the U.S.\u2013China tariff truce on Aug. 11 pushing any new duties until early November. This extension pauses planned hikes including those on Chinese goods, and keeps China\u2019s existing rates unchanged. The pause shifts competitiveness back toward Chinese manufacturers just as retailers lock in Q4 production.\nInflation Impact Is Still Unclear\nOn Aug. 7, the Budget Lab at Yale updated its tariff model to include actions through Aug. 6. The report estimates an average overall effective tariff rate of 18.6% before substitution, with a short-run price impact of about 1.8% and an average household income loss of roughly $2,400, assuming no monetary policy offset.\nOne day later, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported July CPI. Headline inflation rose 0.2% month over month and 2.7% year over year. Core inflation increased 0.3% on the month and 3.1% on the year. The numbers suggest that, for now, tariff pass-through has not yet driven a sharp reacceleration in consumer prices as effects tend to lag. Peak inflation impacts could hit as holiday inventory arrives on shelves.\nTariff Milestones\n- \u201cLiberation Day\u201d Universal Tariff\nAnnounced April 2, this measure applied a baseline duty to nearly all imports, with reciprocal rates varying by country. It is the foundation for today\u2019s trade environment and applies across categories from apparel to electronics to food.\n- Layered Sector Surcharges\nTargeted Section 232 actions add extra duties for specific categories, including automobiles (effective April 3), auto parts (effective May 3), steel and aluminum (rates doubled to 50% in June), and copper-intensive products (50% of copper input value, effective Aug. 1). These charges stack on top of the universal tariff.\n- IEEPA Legal Challenge (Late May)\nThe U.S. Court of International Trade struck down certain tariffs issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and issued an injunction. The Federal Circuit stayed that order, keeping duties in place pending appeal. The eventual ruling could have major implications for the durability of the current tariff framework.\n- China Truce, Through Early November\nThe Aug. 11 extension prevents an immediate spike in China rates, keeping them steady into the heart of the holiday build.\n- India Escalation, Aug. 27\nA 25% surcharge will stack with the universal rate to reach 50%, with limited exemptions for goods already in transit.\nRetail And Consumer Tariff Impact\nHoliday Sourcing Tilts Back To China\nWith China rates frozen until November, retailers can land late October and early November goods under current terms. The India increase narrows its price advantage just as final holiday orders are locked, pushing some sourcing back toward China, reversing years of \u201cChina-plus-one\u201d diversification. Several India-based suppliers report that orders placed earlier in the summer have already been canceled or redirected to Chinese factories in the days following the tariff extension. For retailers, these shifts are landing at a critical point in the production cycle, when manufacturing lead times for peak Q4 goods are already tight.\nToy Aisles Tell The Story\nChina supplies the majority of U.S. toys, and the sector has warned of higher prices and leaner assortments this year. President Trump\u2019s remark earlier in 2025 that \u201cmaybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30\u201d became a flashpoint, illustrating how policy debates can spill into consumer sentiment. While politically charged, it underscored a real dynamic: retailers may protect key toy price points by trimming accessories, narrowing SKUs or delaying less popular lines.\nMetals Ripple Into Durables\nHigher steel, aluminum and copper costs will filter through to lighting, small appliances, HVAC and electrical goods gradually, as contracts reset. Seasonal items like grills and heaters may see quicker increases as retailers decide whether to absorb costs or pass them on.\nShelf-Price Strategy\nThe Yale model\u2019s 1.8% price impact aligns with retail plans: selective increases in metal-heavy and electronics-adjacent categories, balanced by deeper promotions and expanded private-label offerings to keep key price points stable.\nMacro Risks Into 2026\nYale\u2019s model, published prior to the late-August tariff escalation on India, estimated that current policies could trim real GDP growth by 0.5 percentage point in both 2025 and 2026 and raise unemployment by 0.3 percentage point this year and 0.7 point by the end of 2026. With India now facing a 50% duty on many exports, the inflationary and growth impacts may be higher than originally projected, particularly in categories where India has been gaining share from China such as textiles, footwear, and commodities. If the China pause lapses in November, costs for spring 2026 receipts could spike during the Lunar New Year production cycle. If it holds, a gradual \u201cChina-plus-one\u201d sourcing strategy is still likely to accelerate without displacing China entirely.\nThe Retail Tariff Playbook\n- Front-Load And Diversify Shipments\nPull forward Q4 orders under current China rates and use multiple ports to reduce congestion risk.\n- Engineer The Bill Of Materials\nReduce copper and aluminum content, re-specify components and pre-buy trims ahead of India\u2019s Aug. 27 increase.\n- Price By Attribute\nHold the line on key value items while recovering margin on higher-cost SKUs.\n- Tighten Contracts\nReview tariff-sharing terms and ensure product classifications are current.\n- Scenario-Plan For 2026\nPrepare for both renewed China hikes and a continued truce.\nHow Tariffs Could Impact The Holiday Shopping Season\nTariffs have become a standing policy tool rather than a temporary bargaining chip. The next flashpoint comes in early November, when the China tariff extension expires. If duties rise, in the middle of peak shipping for early 2026 goods, the industry could see a bifurcated supply chain strategy: heavy reliance on China for holiday 2025, paired with a rapid pivot elsewhere for early 2026 replenishment.\nBetween now and then, retailers must navigate a policy environment where trade announcements can swing sourcing math overnight. The winners will be those that can adapt quickly, negotiate strategically, and forecast beyond the next policy headline."
