Keep only the first four mover lines, but tighten each to the required syntax:  \n- In the Driver/Mechanism field, prepend the asset (e.g., “UST10Y”) and explicitly state the causal direction (e.g., “Defense bill passes + dovish Fed cuts → UST10Y lift (O6LHRBLFM)(GK86UUQPN)”).  \n- Verify every line ends with a single probability value and no extraneous numbers or text.  \n- Ensure the What to watch field lists only the relevant watch points with their citations, e.g., “Fed July/Aug minutes, defense bill funding details (GK86UUQPN)(O6LHRBLFM)”.  \n- Double‑check that each line follows the exact format: *Up/Down | 3–6 mo | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %*.  \n- Delete any stray characters (e.g., “1.5”, “70”) and remove the trailing “| 70” from the last line. Once cleaned, the four lines will satisfy the 4‑line, 2 Up/2 Down requirement with proper causal links and citations.",
