  "description": "Recent raids at Los Angeles Home Depot stores are raising concerns over whether federal agents may be violating a temporary restraining order that bans the use of racial profiling in immigration arrests.",
  "content": "This image taken from a video shows federal agents jumping out of a Penske box truck during an immigration raid at a Home Depot in Los Angeles on Wednesday.\n\nFederal agents detained day laborers outside of a Home Depot in Van Nuys during two raids Friday morning, raising questions over whether their actions may violate a court order that bans agents from using racial profiling to carry out indiscriminate immigration arrests.\n\nThe operations took place around 7:35 a.m. and then again at 11:50 a.m. outside the Home Depot on Roscoe Boulevard, according to Maegan Ortiz, executive director of Instituto de Educaci\u00f3n Popular del Sur de California, which runs a resource center for day laborers directly next to the store.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which includes Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nBut U.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Greg Bovino told Fox News on Friday that federal agents always abide by the law during enforcement operations.\n\n\u201cIn Los Angeles right now \u2014 today, as a matter of fact \u2014 we have agents out on the streets right now making apprehensions, as you and I are speaking,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing that again, legally, ethically and morally.\u201d\n\nA number of unmarked white vans started circling the parking lot and immigration agents began \u201cgrabbing people first and then asking people for ID\u201d said Ortiz, adding that her organization has confirmed 10 people were taken.\n\n\u201c[The agents] came straight for the day labor center,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cIt is very clear they are targeting day laborers and they are targeting the organization.\u201d\n\nOn July 11, a U.S. district judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking federal agents in Southern and Central California from targeting people based on their race, language, vocation or location without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally.\n\nAt the time, immigration advocates believed the order would legally bar agents from roving such places as Home Depots and car washes and indiscriminately stopping brown-skinned, Spanish-speaking workers.\n\n\u201cThis is a clear violation of the TRO,\u201d said Ortiz regarding Friday\u2019s raids. \u201cThis is, in my opinion, contempt.\u201d\n\nThe temporary restraining order was last Friday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Trump administration has since appealed to the Supreme Court, saying the ruling \u201cthreatens to upend immigration officials\u2019 ability to enforce the immigration laws in the Central District of California by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop.\u201d\n\nFollowing the temporary restraining order, Southern California saw a significant drop in the number of undocumented immigrants arrested. But there is anecdotal evidence that the immigration raids may be picking up steam in Los Angeles once again.\n\nFederal agents reportedly targeted a car wash in Lakewood on Saturday and a Home Depot in Hollywood on Monday, Ortiz said.\n\nThen on Wednesday, Customs and Border Protection agents burst out of a Penske rental truck and detained day laborers at a Westlake Home Depot in a raid dubbed \u201cOperation Trojan Horse.\u201d\n\nL.A. Mayor Karen Bass raised concerns over whether the action violated the temporary restraining order, and directed City Atty. Hydee Feldstein Soto to look into the matter.\n\n\u201cJust being a Home Depot day laborer, to me, is not probable cause [for arrest],\u201d Bass said Thursday.\n\nAt a news conference Friday, Feldstein Soto said that video from the Westlake raid appeared to show the Trump administration violating the court\u2019s temporary restraining order but noted that the matter was still under investigation.\n\n\u201cWe are very cognizant of the fact that that Penske truck seemed to be engaged in a lot of the exact behavior that the language of the TRO specifically prohibits,\u201d she said.\n\nA Penske spokesman previously told The Times that the company was not aware its trucks would be used in the operation and had not authorized the federal government to do so.\n\nShould the city attorney\u2019s office conclude that the order was violated, it may take action to identify the agents involved or push for stronger legal protections, Feldstein Soto said.\n\nBovino, however, defended the legality of ongoing Home Depot raids.\n\n\u201cThe Border Patrol, CBP and our allied law enforcement partners, when we conduct law enforcement operations, we always abide by the law \u2014 whether it\u2019s a temporary restraining order ... whether it\u2019s applicable federal laws, rules and regulations, and most especially the Constitution of the United States,\u201d he said during an interview with Fox News.\n\nBovino said Operation Trojan Horse was a targeted operation based on pre-intelligence, not an indiscriminate sweep.\n\n\u201cWe knew there was criminal activity afoot there for a long time, so we\u2019re not going to ignore criminal activity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going after it, and that\u2019s exactly what we did.\u201d\n\nHe said that of the 16 people apprehended during Operation Trojan Horse, at least six had \u201csignificant immigration and criminal histories.\u201d He said this reflects the trend seen in larger immigration operations, where 30% to 40% of people arrested typically have significant immigration and criminal histories.\n\nA Times review of Immigration and Customs Enforcement data in June found that the majority of people arrested in Southern California had no criminal history.\n\nOf the 2,031 people arrested from June 1 to June 26, about 68% of those had no criminal convictions and 57% had never been charged with a crime.",

      "text": "Plummeting ICE arrests in L.A. raise questions about Trump\u2019s immigration agenda\n- Share via\n- The number of undocumented immigrants arrested around Los Angeles has dropped significantly, according to new data.\n- Experts suggest the drop is the result of a federal court ruling that bars federal agents from arresting people without probable cause to believe they are in the U.S. illegally.\nArrests of undocumented immigrants have dropped significantly across the Los Angeles region two months after the Trump administration launched its aggressive mass deportation operation, according to new figures released Wednesday by Homeland Security.\nFederal authorities told The Times on July 8 that federal agents had arrested 2,792 undocumented immigrants in the seven counties in and around L.A. since June 6. Homeland Security updated that number Wednesday, indicating that fewer than 1,400 immigrants have been arrested in the region in the last month.\n\u201cSince June 6, 2025, ICE and CBP have made a total of 4,163 arrests in the Los Angeles area,\u201d Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement provided to The Times.\nWhile 1,371 arrests across the L.A. region since July 8 is still a much higher figure than any recent month before June, it represents a notable drop from the 2,792 arrests during the previous month.\nThe new figures confirm what many immigration experts suspected: The Trump administration\u2019s immigration agenda in L.A. has faltered since federal courts blocked federal agents from arresting people without probable cause to believe they are in the U.S. illegally.\nThe majority of people held in the June immigration raids in Southern California were not criminals. Nearly half of them were Mexicans and most were men.\nMcLaughlin said Wednesday that Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem\u2019s agenda remained the same.\n\u201cSecretary Noem unleashed ICE and CBP to arrest criminal illegal aliens including terrorists, gang members, murderers, pedophiles, and sexual predators,\u201d McLaughlin said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cWe will continue to enforce the law and remove the worst of the worst.\u201d\nTrump administration officials have long maintained they are focused on criminals. But a few days after White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller announced in late May he had set a new goal of arresting 3,000 undocumented migrants across the country a day, federal agents fanned out across L.A. to snatch people off the streets and from their workplaces.\nWhite House top border policy advisor Tom Homan suggested federal officials adopted the strategy of raiding streets and workplaces to get around \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions, such as Los Angeles, that bar municipal resources and personnel from being used for immigration enforcement.\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t arrest them in jail, we\u2019ll go out to the communities,\u201d Homan told CBS News.\nBut after local protesters rallied to resist and Trump deployed the National Guard and U.S. Marines to the city, the administration\u2019s ability to ramp up deportations across L.A. was dealt a blow in the federal courts.\nData from the initial days of the immigration operation suggest a majority of those arrested were not convicted criminals. Most were working-age men, nearly half Mexican.\nOn July 11, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, an appointee of President Biden, issued a temporary restraining order that blocks federal agents in southern and central California from targeting people based on their race, language, vocation or location without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally.\nThat decision was upheld last Friday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. It is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\u201cIf, as Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion,\u201d the panel wrote, \u201cthey can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing a subset of stops not supported by reasonable suspicion.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to know whether July numbers signal a permanent change in tactics.\nOn Tuesday, Border Patrol agent carried out a raid at the Home Depot in Westlake, arresting 16 people.\n\u201cFor those who thought Immigration enforcement had stopped in Southern California, think again,\u201d acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli posted on X shortly after the raid. \u201cThe enforcement of federal law is not negotiable and there are no sanctuaries from the reach of the federal government.\u201d\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said her office was looking into the matter but added: \u201cFrom the video and from the stills, it looks like the exact same thing that we were seeing before.\u201d"

      "text": "As more citizens are swept up in immigration raids, Democrats demand answers\n- Share via\n- A group of 49 Democratic U.S. senators and representatives are demanding the Department of Homeland of Security release details on the arrests, detainment of U.S. citizens caught up in its immigration sweeps.\n- The department reports that no citizens have been deported, though at least three American-born children have been removed from the country, according to a lawsuit.\n- The crackdown is expected to massively expand after Congress approved a $170 billion budget for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nAmerican citizens have been increasingly caught up in the immigration crackdown: a 4-year-old boy with cancer deported to Honduras, a doctoral student filming a raid in Hollywood detained for 25 hours, an Illinois man held for 10 hours in detention.\nIncreasingly frustrated that the aggressive tactics are sweeping up American citizens, Democratic members of Congress have been pressing for a full accounting of the citizens detained.\nOn Friday morning 49 Congress members, led by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), and Reps. Lou Correa (D-Santa Ana) and Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.), sent letters to the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General Joseph V. Cuffari and two other immigration oversight offices asking them to open an investigation into encounters with American citizens and \u201cdetermine whether DHS is violating Americans\u2019 civil rights.\u201d\n\u201cICE policy makes clear that, by law \u2018ICE cannot assert its civil immigration enforcement authority to arrest and/or detain a U.S. citizen,\u201d the legislators wrote. \u201cHowever, in recent high-profile cases, ICE has erroneously arrested U.S. citizens, at times appearing to use violent physical force.\u201d\n\u201cICE has even deported U.S. citizens: in multiple cases, ICE has deported U.S. citizen children along with their undocumented parents, reportedly against the families\u2019 wishes. Particularly in Latino and Native American communities, Americans increasingly fear that their citizenship will not protect them from being swept up in DHS\u2019s immigration enforcement activities.\u201d\nFor months Democratic members of Congress have been demanding the Trump administration answer pointed questions, to little avail.\nThe letters were sent to Cuffari, Troup Hemenway, acting officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and Joseph Guy, director for the Office of Immigration Detention Ombudsman. The latter two of those offices have been hollowed out under the Trump administration, which had attempted to abolish them completely.\n\u201cThe administration owes the American people answers, particularly as Republicans in Congress just approved record funding for immigration enforcement, which threatens to put even more citizens at risk,\u201d said Warren.\nThe Trump administration has adamantly defended its actions.\n\u201cDHS enforcement operations are highly targeted and are not resulting in the arrest of U.S. citizens,\u201d said department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin in response to The Times\u2019 inquiry about the number of Americans detained, arrested and deported under the administration.\n\u201cWe do our due diligence. We know who we are targeting ahead of time,\u201d she said. \u201cIf and when we do encounter individuals subject to arrest, our law enforcement are trained to ask a series of well-determined questions to determine status and removability. \u201c\nIn the case of Romero, the 4-year old with Stage-4 cancer, DHS said at the time that his mother had a final deportation order and said she chose to be deported with her children. Her lawyers contend the mother, who was arrested during a check-in with immigration officials in Louisiana, was never given a choice and was prohibited from talking to lawyers. They filed a lawsuit last month, along with another mother who also was deported with her 2-year-old citizen daughter.\nJennifer Iba\u00f1ez Whitlock, a policy expert at the National Immigration Law Center, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement used to publish data related to citizens booked-in and arrested, but that was mandated through appropriations and is no longer required.\nCurrently available data show that in fiscal year 2025 there were no citizens deported and seven arrested. There were 3,700 parents of citizens removed and 6,341 arrested. The data are aggregated and do not show the location, reason for enforcement, outcome or length of detention \u2014 as lawmakers are asking for.\nWhitlock suspects the data are an undercount based on the number of cases she has seen in the media.\nThe immigration crackdown is expected to expand considerably. Congress approved a $170-billion budget for border and immigration enforcement earlier this summer, giving the agency the largest boost in generations. President Trump wants 10,000 new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and 3,000 new Border Patrol agents to be hired.\nImmigrant advocates fear with more capabilities, enforcement levels will explode and exacerbate encounters with citizens. Already they said, the White House has given agencies wider latitude than they had before.\n\u201cWe are seeing the agency unleashed like never before,\u201d said Jesse Franzblau, associate director of policy of National Immigrant Justice Center. \u201cICE is just picking up people, whoever is nearby and there is a lot of racial profiling happening.\u201d\nHe points to Julio Noriega, a 54-year-old U.S. citizen who was among those picked up in sweeps in early January in Chicago and placed in handcuffs.\nNoriega had been looking for work when agents picked him up and took him to an ICE processing center before looking inside his wallet, according to court documents. The Center and the ACLU of Illinois attorneys said he was detained for 10 hours and then released without his arrest ever being documented. Lawyers argued DHS violated a 2022 settlement requiring agents have probable cause to believe that a person is in the country illegally before arresting them and then reporting it.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any transparency about warrantless arrests, we don\u2019t have transparency about how many U.S. citizens are being swept up and being arrested, \u201c he said. The data on citizen detained, he said, aren\u2019t always being captured.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how many U.S. citizens are being detained beyond the media accounts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on these agencies to produce this information. These are serious issues.\u201d\nThe letter asks the oversight bodies to provide by Sept. 5 detailed information on stops, arrests, detentions and deportation of citizens including a breakdown by month, location, reason for enforcement action, outcome, and length of time in ICE custody.\n\u201cIt should send chills down everyone\u2019s spine if just one U.S. citizen is detained without due process during an ICE raid,\u201d said Padilla. \u201cThis is not a question of rights of immigrants versus rights of Americans, it\u2019s about ensuring that due process is afforded and protected for everyone, which the 5th Amendment guarantees.\u201d\nDebrorah Fleischaker, the former chief of staff at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said verifying somebody\u2019s citizenship can sometimes be complicated, but officials should be explaining how that works.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily automatically inappropriate to have arrested or held a U.S. citizen, but they certainly should not be deporting them,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMy guess is that they are encountering U.S citizens much more often than they have historically just because the scope of their interior enforcement activities are so much larger than they ever have been.\u201d\nEduardo Casas, an attorney for Job Garcia, the doctoral student who was detained after filming a raid at a Home Depot in Hollywood, said he has been asking immigration officials for information about citizens detained and arrested during the Los Angeles sweeps this summer, but has so far been rebuffed.\n\u201cThey are not being transparent,\u201d said Eduardo Casas, an attorney with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. \u201cWe know that citizens are being caught up in this broader enforcement paradigm that centers around mass deportation. The way they try to accomplish mass deportation is by pushing the boundaries of civil liberties in the same way that they\u2019ve done for people like Job.\u201d\nCasas said he interviewed other citizens present during raids and a pattern emerged. People filming angered agents, who then arrested them and took them to detention centers.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll take people as far as detention centers, and then say that you may be charged, and then they let them go,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also not always a very formal process.\u201d"

Gavin Newsom chided deals struck by Ivy Leagues and said the university would do \u2018the right thing.\u2019\nThe federal government on Friday said UC should pay the billion-dollar fine in installments and contribute $172 million to a fund for Jewish students and other individuals affected by alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The statute covers illegal discrimination related to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, including Jewish and Israeli identity.\n- Share via\nIn addition, the Trump administration demanded sweeping campus changes encompassing protests, admissions, gender identity in sports and housing, the abolition of scholarships for racial or ethnic groups, and submission to an outside monitor over the agreement, according to four UC senior officials who have reviewed the proposal.\n\u201cHe has threatened us through extortion with a billion-dollar fine, unless we do his bidding,\u201d Newsom said.\n\u201cWe will not be complicit in this kind of attack on academic freedom on this extraordinary public institution. We are not like some of those other institutions,\u201d he said.\nThe governor appeared to be referring to controversial and costly deals the Trump administration secured from Columbia and Brown universities over charges similar to those facing UCLA, deals Newsom criticized a day earlier in public remarks.\nIn a statement Friday that UC was \u201creviewing\u201d the terms, UC President James B. Milliken, who oversees the 10-campus system that includes UCLA, also seemed to rebuff the demand.\nGov. Gavin Newsom and California legislative and congressional members stood with Texas state lawmakers in their opposition to President Trump\u2019s plan to redraw voting maps to hold on to power in the midterm election.\n\u201cAs a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country\u2019s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians,\u201d Milliken said. \u201cAmericans across this great nation rely on the vital work of UCLA and the UC system for technologies and medical therapies that save lives, grow the U.S. economy, and protect our national security.\u201d\nUC Regents Chair Janet Reilly told The Times the university was still willing to negotiate with the Trump administration but not on \u201cunacceptable\u201d terms.\n\u201cDemand for a $1 billion payment from UCLA, coupled with conditions that contradict the university\u2019s values, is unacceptable,\u201d Reilly said, describing it as a \u201cfinancial burden\u201d that would be \u201ccatastrophic for our students, research, our patients and the people of California.\n\u201cThe university remains willing to engage in a constructive and good faith dialogue with the federal government but the University of California will always stand firm in protecting the integrity and values of our institution,\u201d Reilly said.\nA spokesperson for UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk referred The Times to Milliken\u2019s statement. Federal negotiations are being handled on a UC-wide level.\nUC is grappling with how to restore $584 million in frozen medical and science grant funds to UCLA. If the deal was accepted, it would be the largest settlement between a university and the Trump administration, far surpassing a $221-million agreement that Columbia University announced last month. Harvard is also reportedly considering a settlement involving a hefty fine.\n\u201cWe would never agree to this,\u201d said one of the UC officials who is involved in the deliberations with the Trump administration. \u201cIt is more money than was frozen at UCLA. So how does that make sense?\u201d\nBut another senior UC official said the figure was understandable if it resolved all federal investigations across the system, even if UC may not ultimately agree to it. The federal proposal focuses on UCLA only, not all campuses.\nAny payment would be a political liability for the university and state leaders in deep-blue California, where Trump\u2019s policies are highly unpopular. A billion dollars would be a financial burden for a university system that is already facing a hiring freeze, budget squeezes, deferred state funding and scattered layoffs.\nUCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk and UC President James B. Milliken on Wednesday said that federal grants suspensions total $584 million to the campus and university leaders will negotiate with the Trump administration to restore the funds.\nUC and individual campuses are under multiple federal investigations into alleged use of race in admissions, employment discrimination against Jews, civil rights complaints from Jewish students and improper reporting of foreign donations.\nUCLA has faced the most charges from the government of any UC or public university, many of them tied to a 2024 pro-Palestinian encampment.\nThe encampment, which unsuccessfully demanded the university divest from weapons companies tied to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, was targeted in a violent overnight attack last spring and was later the subject of federal lawsuit by pro-Israel Jewish students. The students, along with a professor, accused UCLA of enabling antisemitism by not shutting down the encampment, which plaintiffs said blocked pro-Israel Jews from campus pathways. UCLA settled the suit for $6.45 million, including more than $2 million in donations to Jewish nonprofits.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s Friday offer follows a similar playbook to agreements it reached with Columbia and Brown universities to restore federal funding and resolve allegations of civil rights violations against Jewish and Israeli students.\nTrump wants to remake universities, which he has called \u201cMarxist\u201d hotbeds of liberalism and anti-Israel sentiment. During his second term, federal agencies have suspended or canceled billions in federal medical and science grants related to gender, LGBTQ+ issues or in response to campuses it accuses of being antisemitic. The White House has also attacked campus diversity programs and admissions practices as being illegal discrimination against white and Asian Americans.\nUniversity leaders have challenged the notion that cutting medical research helps protect Jewish people. \u201cThis far-reaching penalty of defunding life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination,\u201d Frenk, the UCLA chancellor, said in a campus letter this week.\nAt UCLA, Trump\u2019s demands include an end to scholarships that focus on race or ethnicity, the sharing of admissions data with the government and changes to campus protest rules. The Trump administration is also proposing that UCLA Health and the medical school cease gender-affirming care for transgender people.\nUC has already overhauled practices in some areas called for by the Trump administration \u2014 including a ban on protest encampments and the abolition of diversity statements in hiring.\nThe Trump administration is also saying it wants an outside monitor to oversee the agreement.\nThe proposal came one day after Newsom said UC should not bend \u201con their knees\u201d to Trump. Newsom, a Democrat, has fashioned himself as a national anti-Trump figure and is considering a presidential run in 2028.\nThe university system, run by Milliken \u2014 who assumed his role only last week \u2014 and the Board of Regents, is independent under the state Constitution. But the governor can exercise political sway over the regents, whose members he appoints. Newsom also holds an ex-officio seat on the board.\nKaleem reported from Los Angeles and Wilner from Washington.

      "text": "Trump administration asks Supreme Court to lift limits on ICE\u2019s \u2018roving patrols\u2019\n- Share via\nThe Trump administration on Thursday petitioned the Supreme Court to free up its mass deportation efforts across Southern California, seeking to lift a ban on \u201croving patrols\u201d implemented after a lower court found such tactics likely violate the 4th Amendment.\nThe restrictions, initially handed down in a July 11 order, bar masked and heavily armed agents from snatching people off the streets of Los Angeles and cities in seven other counties without first establishing reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally.\nUnder the 4th Amendment, reasonable suspicion cannot be based solely on race, ethnicity, language, location or employment, either alone or in combination, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong of Los Angeles found in her original decision.\nThe Trump administration said in its appeal to the high court that Frimpong\u2019s ruling, upheld last week by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, \u201cthreatens to upend immigration officials\u2019 ability to enforce the immigration laws in the Central District of California by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop.\u201d\nLawyers behind the lawsuits challenging the immigration tactics immediately questioned the Trump administration\u2019s arguments.\n\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d said Mark Rosenbaum of Public Counsel, part of the coalition of civil rights groups and individual attorneys challenging cases of three immigrants and two U.S. citizens swept up in chaotic arrests. \u201cThe brief is asking the Supreme Court to bless open season on anybody on Los Angeles who happens to be Latino.\u201d\nThe move comes barely 24 hours after heavily armed Border Patrol agents snared workers outside a Westlake Home Depot after popping out of the back of a Penske moving truck \u2014 actions some experts said appeared to violate the court\u2019s order.\nIf the Supreme Court takes up the case, many now think similar aggressive and seemingly indiscriminate enforcement actions could once again become the norm.\n\u201cAnything having to do with law enforcement and immigration, the Supreme Court seems to be giving the president free rein,\u201d said Eric J. Segall, a professor at Georgia State University College of Law and a prominent scholar of the country\u2019s highest court. \u201cI think the court is going to side with the Trump administration.\u201d\nThe Department of Justice has repeatedly argued that the temporary restraining order causes \u201cmanifest irreparable harm\u201d to the government. Officials are especially eager to see it overturned because California\u2019s Central District is the single most populous in the country, and home to a plurality of undocumented immigrants.\nIn its Supreme Court petition, the Justice Department alleged that roughly 10% of the region\u2019s residents are in the U.S. illegally.\n\u201cAccording to estimates from Department of Homeland Security data, nearly 4 million illegal aliens are in California, and nearly 2 million are in the Central District of California. Los Angeles County alone had an estimated 951,000 illegal aliens as of 2019 \u2014 by far the most of any county in the United States,\u201d the petition said.\nPresident Trump made mass deportations a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign, and has poured billions in federal funding and untold political capital into the arrest, incarceration and removal of immigrants. Though Justice Department lawyers told the appellate court there was no policy or quota, administration officials and those involved in planning its deportation operations have repeatedly cited 3,000 arrests a day and a million deportations a year as objectives.\nDistrict and appellate courts have stalled, blocked and sometimes reversed many of those efforts in recent weeks, forcing the return of a Maryland father mistakenly deported to Salvadoran prison, compelling the release of student protesters from ICE detention, preserving birthright citizenship for children of immigrant parents and stopping construction of \u201cAlligator Alcatraz.\u201d\nBut little of the president\u2019s immigration agenda has so far been tested in the Supreme Court.\nIf the outcome is unfavorable for Trump, some observers wonder whether he will let the justices limit his agenda.\n\u201cEven if they were to lose in the Supreme Court, I have serious doubts they will stop,\u201d Segall said."

      "text": "Majority of people arrested in L.A. immigration raids had no criminal history\n- Share via\nFederal agents continued to arrest mostly immigrants with no criminal convictions in sweeps that roiled Southern California over the last month, according to new data released Tuesday.\nFrom June 1 to June 26, Immigration and Customs Enforcement data show 2,031 were arrested in a seven-county area. About 68% of those had no criminal convictions and 57% had never been charged with a crime.\nNearly half of those arrested in June were Mexican nationals. Most were men, with a median age of 39.\nSeparately, a survey of 330 Mexicans in local detention centers, conducted by the Mexican Consulate between June 6 and July 6, found that half had lived in the U.S. for at least a decade, more than a third for more than 20 years, and nearly a third had American-born children.\nThe new information sheds light on the people caught up in the government\u2019s crackdown. The arrest data come from the Deportation Data Project, consisting of a group of lawyers and academics who received the information as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. It shows a continuing trend highlighted in earlier figures analyzed by The Times: Aggressive enforcement operations in Los Angeles have largely pulled in immigrants without a criminal record.\n\u201c[President] Trump and Stephen Miller don\u2019t care about removing the \u2018worst first\u2019 \u2014 they only care about arresting whoever they can to complete their massive arrest quotas,\u201d said Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom. \u201cAll they care about is mass chaos and mass detentions, instilling fear statewide, detaining and deporting children and families, terrifying people into submission and giving up their rights, all while threatening the very fabric of our society.\u201d\nCalifornia has been battling the Trump administration as it has zeroed in on Los Angeles, a Democratic bastion, as ground zero for its mass deportation campaign. Federal agents launched the sweeps June 6, drawing protesters and angry crowds, prompting Trump to call in the National Guard and the Marines.\nAlmost half of Mexican immigrants detained in ICE raids in the L.A. area have been in the U.S. for more than a decade.\nLegal challenges have hampered the efforts. On Friday, in a lawsuit brought by civil rights groups against the Trump administration, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, an appointee of President Biden, temporarily blocked federal agents in much of Southern California from using racial profiling to carry out immigration arrests. Since she issued her ruling, the indiscriminate raids at Home Depots and car washes have stopped.\nThe order is being challenged by U.S. Justice Department attorneys who are appealing the lawsuit and asking for an immediate pause of the order. And Department of Homeland Security officials have said they will not back down.\n\u201cStill hard at work catching criminal illegal aliens in #LosAngeles. We\u2019re not leaving until our mission is accomplished,\u201d U.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino wrote Tuesday on X.\nBovino, based near the U.S.-Mexican border in Imperial County, has played a prominent role in the raids across Southern California. He and others in the administration have pushed back on the idea that agents are going after noncriminals.\n\u201cYou think only noncriminal illegal aliens are hanging out at day laborer spots? Absolutely not true,\u201d he posted on July 8, highlighting a Guatemalan man he said was picked up with an outstanding warrant in his home country for sexual aggression.\nAs the raids and demonstrations have died down, Trump on Tuesday released about half of the National Guard troops deployed in Los Angeles.\nNationwide, the average daily arrest rate in the U.S. was 1,139 for June 1-10, decreasing to 990 for June 11-27. In all, 27,500 people were arrested during those four weeks, and it is unclear from the data how many have been deported.\nBut the immigrants picked up off the streets in Southern California were even less likely to be criminals than those turned over to ICE by state or local authorities.\nOf those arrested on the street, about 75% had no criminal convictions and 62% had no convictions or pending charges."

      "text": "Federal judge halts indiscriminate immigration stops in Los Angeles and beyond\n- Share via\nIn a searing ruling against the Trump administration, a federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked federal agents from using racial profiling to carry out indiscriminate immigration arrests that advocates say have terrorized Angelenos, forced people into hiding and damaged the local economy.\nThe ruling by U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, an appointee of President Biden, was widely hailed by immigrant rights groups and California Democrats, who have been in a pitched battle with the administration over recent sweeps through Southern California immigrant neighborhoods.\nIf adhered to, the ruling would stop immigration agents from roving around Home Depots and car washes, stopping brown-skinned, Spanish-speaking day laborers and others to arrest on immigration charges, as they have been for the past month.\n\u201cJustice prevailed today,\u201d Gov. Gavin Newsom posted about the ruling on X Friday evening.\n\u201cThe court\u2019s decision puts a temporary stop to federal immigration officials violating people\u2019s rights and racial profiling,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCalifornia stands with the law and the Constitution \u2014 and I call on the Trump Administration to do the same.\u201d\nThe orders cover Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. Following the ruling, groups that have been monitoring the immigration sweeps reported none as of Saturday afternoon.\nThe White House said it would challenge the ruling.\n\u201cNo federal judge has the authority to dictate immigration policy \u2014 that authority rests with Congress and the President,\u201d said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman. \u201cEnforcement operations require careful planning and execution; skills far beyond the purview or jurisdiction of any judge. We expect this gross overstep of judicial authority to be corrected on appeal.\u201d\nIn her ruling, Frimpong said she found a sufficient amount of evidence that agents were using race, language, a person\u2019s vocation or the location they are at, such as a car wash, Home Depot, swap meet or row of street vendors, to form \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d \u2014 the legal standard needed to detain someone. Frimpong said the reliance on those factors, either alone or in combination does not meet the requirements of the 4th Amendment.\n\u201cWhat the federal government would have this Court believe in the face of a mountain of evidence presented in this case is that none of this is actually happening,\u201d she said.\nFrimpong ordered federal agents not to use those factors to establish reasonable suspicion to detain people. And that all those in custody at a downtown detention facility known as B-18 must be given 24-hour access to lawyers and a confidential phone line.\nU.S. Atty. Bill Essayli, who has brought charges against protesters at the raids, blasted the ruling on X.\n\u201cWe strongly disagree with the allegations in the lawsuit and maintain that our agents have never detained individuals without proper legal justification,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOur federal agents will continue to enforce the law and abide by the U.S. Constitution.\u201d\nThe ruling came at a particularly fraught moment as details of the largest work-site enforcement raid since the crackdown began to emerge.\nAgents arrested around 200 suspected undocumented immigrants at two cannabis operations on Thursday, and prompted a tense standoff between authorities and hundreds of protesters in Ventura County. A man who fell 30 feet from a greenhouse roof during the raid was gravely injured and the FBI is investigating whether shots were fired at federal agents during the protest.\nAlthough the order is temporary, the coalition will seek a preliminary injunction that would make it more permanent. The judge has not yet ruled on a request by Los Angeles city, county and seven other municipalities to join the lawsuit.\n\u201cLos Angeles has been under assault by the Trump Administration as masked men grab people off the street, chase working people through parking lots and march through children\u2019s summer camps,\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement Friday evening. \u201cWe went to court against the administration because we will never accept these outrageous and un-American acts as normal.\u201d\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, Public Counsel, other groups and private attorneys filed the lawsuit on behalf of several immigrant rights groups, three immigrants picked up at a bus stop and two U.S. citizens, one of whom was held despite showing agents his identification .\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the most important decision in the history of the country about limitations on what immigration authorities can do when they carry out operations,\u201d said Mark Rosenbaum, a lawyer with Public Counsel. \u201cIt means that they can\u2019t racially profile, they can\u2019t treat car wash workers and nannies as illegally in the country just because of who they are. It means that those whom they sweep into detention have to have access to attorneys right away. And it means that the Constitution is not a dirty word. It\u2019s brought the rule of law back to Los Angeles.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs argued in their complaint that immigration agents cornered brown-skinned people in Home Depot parking lots, at carwashes and at bus stops across Southern California in a show of force without establishing reasonable suspicion that they had violated immigration laws. They allege agents didn\u2019t identify themselves, as required under federal law, and made unlawful warrantless arrests.\nOnce someone was in custody, the complaint argues, their constitutional rights were further violated by being held in \u201cdeplorable\u201d conditions at B-18 without access to a lawyer, or regular food and water.\nFrimpong firmly agreed with the plaintiffs, saying they were likely to succeed in trial.\nSince June 6, immigration agents have arrested nearly 2,800 undocumented individuals, according to data released by the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday. A Times analysis of arrest data from June 1 to 10 found that 69% of those arrested during that period had no criminal conviction and 58% had never been charged with a crime.\nThe sweeps have paralyzed parts of the city where high numbers of immigrants work.\nEarlier in the day, before the order was issued, Tom Homan, Trump\u2019s chief advisor on border policy, responded to the tentative ruling, telling Fox News: \u201cIf the judge makes a decision against what the officers are trained, against what the law is based upon,\u201d he said that it would \u201cshut down operations.\u201d\nHe echoed government attorneys who argued that agents, in deciding whether to stop a person, can consider location, vocation, clothing, whether they run, and other factors.\n\u201cICE officers and Border Patrol don\u2019t need probable cause to walk up to somebody, briefly detain them, and question them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just need the totality of the circumstances.\u201d\nHe said agents receive training on the 4th Amendment every six months.\nJustice Department attorney Sean Skedzielewski, in an hours-long hearing Thursday afternoon, said he would seek a $30-million bond, should the order be granted in order to train agents to comply with it. Frimpong wrote in her decision she would reject the government\u2019s request, since the restraining order doesn\u2019t require training, only \u201ccompliance with existing law.\u201d\nDuring the hearing, Frimpong took issue with Skedzielewski\u2019s lack of specific evidence to refute accusations of indiscriminate targeting.\nWhen he argued that \u201cthese are sophisticated operations\u201d and seemed to say that arrests stemmed from particular people who were being targeted, she questioned how that could be true.\nIn other cases where local and federal law enforcement are targeting people for crimes, the judge pointed out, there are reports after an arrest \u201cas to why they arrested this person, how they happened to be where they were and what they did.\u201d\n\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be anything like that here, which makes it difficult for the court to accept your description of what is happening, because there is no proof that that is what is happening as opposed to what the plaintiffs are saying is happening,\u201d Frimpong said.\nSkedzielewski argued the lack of evidence is why the court should not grant a temporary restraining order. The government, he argued, had only \u201ca couple days\u201d to try to identify individuals mentioned in the court filings.\n\u201cWe just haven\u2019t had a chance to identify in many cases who the people stopped even were, let alone \u2014 over a holiday weekend \u2014 get ahold of the agents,\u201d he said.\nFrimpong didn\u2019t seem moved and questioned the government\u2019s reliance on two high-ranking officials who have played a key role in the raids in Southern California: Kyle Harvick, a Border Patrol agent in charge of El Centro, and Andre Quinones, deputy field office director for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nTheir declarations, she said, were \u201cvery general\u201d and \u201cdid not really engage with the pretty high volume of evidence that the plaintiffs have put in the record of the things we have all seen and heard on the news.\u201d\n\u201cIf there\u2019s any one of these people and there was a report about \u2018this is how we identified this tow yard, parking lot and so on,\u2019 that would have been helpful,\u201d Frimpong said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for the court to believe that in the time that you had, you couldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d\nSkedzielewski said the evidence is replete with instances of stops, but \u201cit is not replete with any evidence that those stops or that the agents in any way failed to follow the law.\u201d\nHe said agents\u2019 actions were \u201cabove board.\u201d\nMohammad Tajsar, an attorney with the ACLU of Southern California, told the judge that agents cannot solely use a person\u2019s workplace, their location or the particular work they\u2019re doing as reasons to stop people.\nTajsar added that it was because of the government\u2019s \u201cmisunderstanding of the law\u201d that they\u2019d made so many stops of U.S. citizens, including Brian Gavidia, a named plaintiff who was detained by Border Patrol agents outside of a tow yard in Montebello.\nTajsar said Gavidia, who was present in the courtroom during the hearing, was stopped \u201cfor no other reason than the fact that he\u2019s Latino and was working at a tow yard\u201d in a predominantly Latino area.\n\u201cBecause of this fundamental misunderstanding of the law from the government, we have seen so many unconstitutional and unlawful arrests,\u201d Tajsar said.\nTajsar also pushed back on the government attorneys saying they didn\u2019t have enough time, stating that \u201cthey had time and they have all the evidence.\u201d\nIn the court filing of the county and cities trying to join the suit, including Pasadena, Montebello, Monterey Park, Santa Monica, Culver City, Pico Rivera and West Hollywood, they countered that the raids haven\u2019t actually been about immigration enforcement, but are instead politically driven \u201cto make an example\u201d of the region for \u201cimplementing policies that President Donald J. Trump dislikes.\u201d\nThey cited Trump\u2019s post on his social media platform where he calls on immigration officials to do \u201call in their power\u201d to achieve \u201cthe single largest Mass Deportation Program in History\u201d by expanding efforts to detain and deport people in Los Angeles and other cities that are \u201cthe core of Democrat power.\u201d\nLate Friday evening, Trump\u2019s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, a Santa Monica native widely viewed as the architect of the sweeping immigration crackdown, responded to the order on X.\n\u201cA communist judge in LA has ordered ICE to report directly to her and radical left NGOs \u2014 not the president,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is another act of insurrection against the United States and its sovereign people.\u201d"

But why?\n- Share via\nWhile Jason Hong was celebrating his 75th birthday, he suddenly found himself thinking about his 1958 Cessna Skyhawk, a white and red single-engine beauty with colorful stripes that he calls his \u201cold treasure.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t fly it much anymore, but given the occasion he resolved to visit his plane as soon as he could to \u201csay hi,\u201d like a lifelong friend you see around holidays and special occasions.\nHong headed to Corona Municipal Airport after church on July 27, but when he got there, the plane was not where he\u2019d left it. Hong was dumbfounded.\n\u201cI got confused,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, did I park it somewhere else, did the airport manager move it? But I looked all over.\u201d\nIt was gone.\nHong was so shocked, he initially didn\u2019t know who to reach out to about a missing, stolen plane. He wondered, did someone fly it out of the airport unnoticed? How long had it been missing?\nThe questions piled up. But the mystery only deepened.\nFamily and neighbors said the family appeared to live a quiet life. Yet hundreds of court records reviewed by The Times, including sworn declarations, surveillance footage images and an autopsy report describe a strained marital relationship and contentious divorce.\nAs Hong would come to find out, the colorful aircraft had been flown across Southern California by an unknown pilot, unnoticed, in a series of joyrides \u2014 or joy flights \u2014 at least twice before and then simply returned to the airport. Both Hong and police were left scratching their heads.\nThe first time he discovered it missing, Hong reported it to Corona police, unsure that he\u2019d ever see the plane he\u2019s owned for nearly 30 years again. After all, he thought, who steals an entire plane?\nThen on the morning of July 29, he got a call from La Verne Police, telling him his plane was found in Brackett Field Airport.\n\u201cThere\u2019s my airplane, sitting there in the airport,\u201d Hong said, finding cigarette butts and garbage strewn about in the cockpit.\nHe barely took time to process what happened when, frustrated, he decided to pull out the battery from the plane, close it up, and go home. The plane wouldn\u2019t start without the battery, he figured, and he could come back the next weekend when he had time to clean and inspect it.\nExcept that, when he returned that Sunday, Aug. 3, the plane had vanished again.\nHong reported the plane missing again with La Verne Police, and wondered what was going on. It wasn\u2019t long before he got another call. This time, El Monte Police told him his plane was sitting at San Gabriel Valley Airport.\nWhen Hong got there to inspect his plane, his confusion only grew.\n\u201cI found it with a battery,\u201d he said.\nIn 2022, a Brink\u2019s big rig transporting millions of dollars of jewelry was burgled at a Grapevine truck stop. The daring, late-night heist captivated the Southland.\nIt hasn\u2019t been just Hong who has found himself befuddled by his disappearing and reappearing plane.\n\u201cThis plane just keeps disappearing out of the blue,\u201d said Sgt. Robert Montanez of the Corona Police Department. \u201cIt\u2019s just weird.\u201d\nMontanez said when Hong reported his plane missing the first time, he\u2019d last seen the aircraft in May in the small Corona airport.\nFor police, a case of an entire plane being stolen was so rare, that officers used the same form used for stolen cars, to take Hong\u2019s report.\nOfficers are also aware that the plane has been taken multiple times, and returned, making the incidents more perplexing. But Montanez said there\u2019s no immediate indication as to who the culprit is.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no camera video, there\u2019s no real leads as to who stole the plane,\u201d Montanez said.\nAfter finding his plane a second time, Hong said he\u2019s tried to put details of the thefts together, but the more he learns the more he grows confused about the circumstances.\nHong looked up his plane on Flight Aware, a site that tracks flights and aircraft, and found that on his 75th birthday, someone took off with his plane from La Verne airport at 9:54 p.m., for a 51-minute flight that at one point neared Palm Springs.\nA few hours later, on July 26, the colorfully striped plane was in the air once again, this time for a brief 22-minute flight from Riverside County toward La Verne that started at about 1:30 a.m.\nIt was the next day that Hong would discover it missing.\nIn Los Angeles County, there is a black market for \u2018anything and everything,\u2019 said Capt. Calvin Mah, who leads the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s Major Crimes Bureau.\nAt first, Hong said, he thought it might have been a random incident, but the details of the repeating incidents didn\u2019t make sense to him, he said.\nThe multiple flights indicate that, whoever has taken his plane has had some sort of flight training, since they\u2019ve been able to land the plane on multiple occasions.\n\u201cLanding is not easy, so they\u2019re trained,\u201d he said.\nHong said he\u2019s also found a headset in the plane, as well as a new battery to replace the one he removed, meaning this mysterious pilot had spent hundreds of dollars on equipment to get his plane back in the air.\nThe replacement of the battery, Hong said, also suggests its someone familiar with not just flying, but the mechanics of the plane as they seemed to have the tools and know-how about the type of battery needed, and how to install it.\nHaving his airplane stolen has been frustrating, Hong said. But learning that the suspect has also been spending money and equipment to use \u2014 and return \u2014 the plane has just been confusing.\n\u201cSomeone breaks into your house, they\u2019re looking for jewelry or cash right?\u201d he said, trying to reason with the circumstances. \u201cBut in this case, what\u2019s the purpose? It\u2019s like someone breaks my window, and then they put a new one up.\u201d\nThe fact that someone has been traveling in it to different airports also puzzles him.\nThe 75-year-old Yorba Linda resident said he\u2019s spoken to regular pilots and employees at the San Gabriel Valley Airport in El Monte, who said that they saw the plane flying in and out of the airport multiple times in July.\n\u201cOn and off, they flew in and out, in and out, almost an entire month without knowing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is really a rare situation.\u201d\nOne regular at the airport, Hong said, told him he saw a woman, about 5 feet, 3 inches tall, and in her 40s or 50s, flying and sitting in the plane on multiple occasions. The man told Hong he had a conversation with her at one point, and distinctly remembered her because she was often seen sitting in the cockpit during the day, making people at the airport wonder why she wouldn\u2019t just relax in the air-conditioned airport lounge.\n\u201cVery strange,\u201d Hong said.\nFor now, Hong has chained his plane in San Gabriel Valley Airport and said he\u2019s uncomfortable flying it until he can thoroughly inspect it.\nOther than that, he\u2019s not sure what to do to keep his plane grounded, or to find out who has been secretly flying it out.\n\u201cI have no idea what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the strangest thing.\u201d"

      "text": "\u2018They run, we chase\u2019: Immigration raids test limits of \u2018probable cause\u2019\n- Share via\nMatilde suffered a heart attack after she was held by immigration agents at a Lowes parking lot and can no longer go to the store without breaking down. Narciso Barranco, a gardener accused of threatening heavily armed agents with a weed whacker, still wakes up with headaches after he was beaten during his arrest. Jaime Alan\u00eds Garcia died after falling 30 feet from a rafter as agents stormed his workplace.\nThe aggressive tactics led by Border Patrol agents hundreds of miles from their posts have left communities jarred, people injured and businesses gutted.\n\u201cI can\u2019t erase the masked faces from my mind,\u201d said Matilde, a 54-year-old mother who is still gripped with fear about the raid in Pacoima. In a bystander video posted on social media, she appears to faint after agents grabbed her from behind. A doctor told Matilde, who asked that her full name not be used, that she had a heart attack.\nCivil rights activists, city leaders, immigrants and their advocates were hopeful that the indiscriminate sweeps targeting Latinos were over in July after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, ruling that Border Patrol agents\u2019 profiling tactics violated the 4th Amendment. They were even more heartened when the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the government\u2019s argument that their tactics were lawful and upheld the restraining order.\nBut this week, Customs and Border Protection struck in Los Angeles again, raiding a car wash and a Home Depot, grabbing anyone who ran from them.\n\u201cWe are not leaving,\u201d said Border Patrol Sector Chief Greg Bovino, who has been leading the operations in California.\nThe temporary restraining orders prohibits agents from stopping someone solely based on their race, language, job or location.\nMayor Karen Bass said it appears as if the Wednesday raid at a Home Depot in Westlake \u2014 dubbed \u201cOperation Trojan Horse\u201d \u2014 violated the order, but city attorneys are still trying to determine the facts.\nThe legal wrangling will continue over the ways agents decide who to target and the level of use of force they use for non-criminal enforcement. The government on Thursday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to lift the judge\u2019s order.\nNow other parts of the country are watching the events in California, expecting federal agents to target their immigrant communities, particularly in states with no judicial orders blocking them.\n\u201cWe saw the videos, the images coming out of Los Angeles. We definitely thought we would be next,\u201d said Rey Wences, with Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which runs a hotline that monitors raids. \u201cWe\u2019re just waiting for the shoe to drop.\u201d\nThe Times reviewed dozens of witness and surveillance videos, pored through criminal complaints and interviewed lawyers, advocates, bystanders and experts to understand how on-the-ground operations have unfolded this summer and where the points of contention are.\nAre \u2018roving patrols\u2019 simply racial profiling?\nBorder Patrol agents were driving down West Olympic Boulevard in Montebello \u2014 a largely Latino community \u2014 when surveillance footage captured their white SUV make a U-turn and pull into the driveway of a tow yard at 4:32 p.m on June 12.\nAs Homeland Security Investigations special agent Nicholas DeSimone later wrote in a federal criminal complaint, the operation was not preplanned but rather part of a \u201croving patrol\u201d\u2014 a controversial tactic that lawsuits link to racial profiling and was widely used in the Los Angeles area after the raids started in June.\n\u201cRoving patrols,\u201d according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, involves agents on foot or in a vehicle simply looking for people who might be undocumented, a practice traditionally focused on the border region.\nWithin minutes, agents had arrested two people at the tow yard. They also cornered a U.S. citizen, Brian Gavidia, who is now part of a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of these stops.\nVideo of the stop taken by his friend went viral and raised red flags early in the crackdown that agents were indiscriminately targeting people because of the way they looked.\n\u201cI\u2019m an American, bro,\u201d Gavidia can be heard saying to the agent, as his friend narrates. \u201cThese guys, literally based off of skin color!\u201d\nBorder Patrol agents on \u2018roving patrol\u2019 arrest U.S. citizen on assault charges. Fear of widespread racial profiling gains momentum as Home Depots and car washes raided.\nThe purpose of a roving patrol is for border agents to deter or respond to illegal activity, according to the agency. These tactics are a departure from agents targeting specific immigrants based on information they have on the person, such as serious criminal histories or removal orders. And while agents have been carrying out roving patrols for more than a decade, they are controversial and untested at such a large scale in the interior of the country.\nIn July, the ACLU of Southern California, Public Counsel, other groups and private attorneys filed a lawsuit in L.A. challenging the constitutionality of the roving patrols and requesting the temporary restraining order. During a hearing, Mohammad Tajsar, an ACLU attorney, told U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong that plaintiffs had documented an \u201coverwhelming record\u201d showing the government \u201chas a policy and practice of conducting so called roving patrols throughout this district to stop individuals without ever making a particularized, individualized assessment of reasonable suspicion that the person is in the United States in violation of U.S. immigration law.\u201d\n\u201cThis practice is officially sanctioned,\u201d Tajsar said during the hearing.\nACLU lawyers had already sued over indiscriminate sweeps in February, after Bovino oversaw roving patrols in Kern County the month before. They argued the agency had a history of detaining people during these patrols without establishing reasonable suspicion of their immigration violation, and of threatening physical harm against those who refuse to comply.\n\u201cBorder Patrol\u2019s interior sweeps demonstrate a pattern of noncompliance with the statutory and constitutional limits on its authority,\u201d attorneys argued in that case. Specifically, they alleged the agency was relying on race or ethnicity to justify stops, using physical abuse if a person refused to voluntary questioning and detaining people who declined to talk.\nPast lawsuits show that Border Patrol agents determined on the fly who to stop, based on the slightest behaviors, from people slowing abruptly, speeding up, avoiding eye contact or not sitting upright.\nBut the agency\u2019s own data show that roving patrols don\u2019t often yield many people that are breaking the law.\nIn Border Patrol\u2019s El Centro sector, where Bovino is stationed, from Oct. 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024, agents conducted 1,114 roving patrol stops, according to a 2024 DHS report. Of roving patrol stops, only 160 were categorized as \u201cApprehensions Deportable.\u201d\nIs running away reasonable suspicion to detain someone?\nOn June 17, Vivaldo Montes Herrera was pushing a trash can across the parking lot of the plaza he\u2019s cleaned for years when he spotted a marked Border Patrol truck, out on a roving patrol, coming straight toward him.\nSurveillance footage captured Montes Herrera pushing the trash can away and starting to run. Even before the Border Patrol truck stopped, an agent opened the door and dashed after the custodial worker.\nTo the agents, the fact that Montes Herrera ran helped create reasonable suspicion that he was in the country illegally. As Border Patrol captioned an Instagram video last month: \u201cWhen they run, we chase.\u201d\nAcross the country, people now wrestle with the question of what do when confronted by immigration agents: Do I run?\nEven people who are in the country legally have tried to make a break for it. In one case, despite having legal status, Domingo Rueda Hernandez ran behind bags of soil during a raid that unfolded outside of a Home Depot in Hollywood.\nIn another instance captured on video, a U.S. citizen is splayed out on a sidewalk in El Monte as two men with vests that read \u201cBorder Patrol\u201d kneel over him.\n\u201cWhat the hell, man,\u201d the man told the agents in perfect English. \u201cI\u2019m not doing nothing wrong.\u201d\n\u201cThen why were you running?\u201d an agent asks.\nGovernment and civil rights lawyers both agree that somebody running from an agent, in some cases, can be grounds for reasonable suspicion. But it doesn\u2019t determine whether an arrest can actually be made.\nIn her ruling, Judge Frimpong did not order the agents to stop the practice but expressed misgivings about it, noting that the government hadn\u2019t explained \u201cwhy fleeing upon seeing unidentified masked men with guns exiting from tinted cars without license plates raises suspicion.\u201d\nIn El Monte, when Montes Herrera was being detained, Adrian Martinez, a worker at a Walmart in the plaza, tried to intervene and was arrested alongside him. Martinez said he heard agents laughing at Montes Herrera and calling him \u201cdumb for running.\u201d\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have chased him if he wouldn\u2019t have ran,\u201d Martinez recalled the agents saying.\n\u201cThey make it seem like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re not going toward them unless they run,\u2019 but they do the most to get them to run,\u201d Martinez said.\n\u201cIf I was that man,\u201d he added, \u201cI would have ran too.\u201d\nCan questions from masked, armed agents be \u201cconsensual\u201d?\n\u201cEres ciudadano Americano,\u201d the Border Patrol agent, identified only as J.C., asked a man in the Montebello tow yard. \u201cAre you an American citizen?\u201d\nThe response is not captured on the footage, but the man is placed in handcuffs soon after.\n\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d an immigration agent asked a man at the Santa Fe Springs swap meet. \u201cWhere were you born?\u201d\n\u201cTustin, Santa Ana. Why are you asking?\u201d the guy taking the video responds.\nImmigration agents said arrests in June and July often stemmed from \u201cconsensual encounters.\u201d\n\u201cThe individuals were free to walk away and terminate the encounter, decline to answer questions and refuse to provide requested identification documents,\u201d Kyle Harvick, who heads patrol for the El Centro Sector, said in a court declaration defending the practice used across the Southern California raids.\n\u201cWhile some of the individuals encountered freely answered questions about their names and place of birth and provided identification documents, others refused to answer questions and/or walked away from the encounters without any further interaction.\u201d\nCivil rights and immigration lawyers say that armed, masked men forcefully barking questions to vendors or people in a Home Depot parking lot is anything but a consensual interaction.\n\u201cIf they are showing up in places with that display of force and authority and surrounding the people they\u2019re trying to talk to, that\u2019s no longer a consensual encounter,\u201d said Eva Bitran, a lawyer with the ACLU of Southern California.\nMasked and armed agents surrounded Pedro Vasquez Perdomo and his co-workers as they waited at a bus stop in Pasadena on June 18. Vasquez Perdomo, who is a plaintiff in the L.A. civil rights lawsuit against the Trump administration, attempted to leave but was quickly handcuffed and put into a vehicle.\n\u201cAt the time he was handcuffed, agents did not have reasonable suspicion of a violation of immigration law,\u201d the lawsuit states. It was only after Vasquez Perdomo was taken to a nearby CVS parking lot that agents checked his identification.\nIn another case, a man who had fled immigration agents at a Downey car wash seemingly avoided arrest by not talking. Video captured the man, in jeans and a blue work shirt, on the ground near his overturned bike as masked men in plain clothes or vests that read \u201cpolice\u201d surrounded him.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell them anything,\u201d Melyssa Rivas, a Downey resident, told the man repeatedly as an agent walked up and put a hand on his back. Urged by the crowd not to speak, the man kept quiet.\n\u201cHave a good day,\u201d the agent told the man, before walking away.\nRivas and several others were recording the interaction, which she believes put pressure on the agents who were seeking to make an arrest.\nWithout reasonable suspicion, agents cannot legally detain someone according to federal regulations that dictate immigration enforcement. The suspicion must be based on \u201carticulable facts.\u201d If an agent can establish enough of those facts to determine there is reasonable suspicion to stop someone, they can.\nTrump administration lawyers say they consider a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d to make that determination, including the occupation of those stopped and the location they were picked up.\nAre car washes or Home Depots fair targets?\nThe masked, armed men pulled up to Beverly Car Wash in Montebello in white trucks with Texas plates. At least six agents, most wearing Border Patrol vests, made beelines to the brown-skinned men toweling down cars.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your migration status?\u201d an agent in camouflage asked a worker named Hector.\nAnother agent cornered Edgar \u201cGordito,\u201d asking him the same, scoffing at his claim he was there as a Mexican tourist.\nOne scared worker jumped over a nearby fence. An unmarked car followed her down the alley. Having fallen hard, she quickly gave herself up. During the raid, which lasted only two minutes, agents arrested three people.\nIn his declaration, Harvick said certain businesses, including car washes, \u201chave been selected for encounters because past experiences have demonstrated that illegal aliens utilize and seek work at these locations.\u201d\nAt least 58 car washes have been hit, some of them more than once, according to the Clean Carwash Worker Center, which has been tracking the raids. After the Beverly Car Wash reopened weeks after the first raid, immigration agents hit it a second time. They arrested another two people who had just started working there.\nAlthough Harvick does not specifically reference Home Depot, so many have been hit that they have become a symbol of the raids.\nDuring a hearing last month, Frimpong called some of the locations that agents had hit \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201cnot necessarily associated with not having status.\u201d\n\u201cAs they said, bus stop, car wash, tow yard \u2014 maybe they\u2019re correlated with people who are low-income or have low income-occupations, maybe they\u2019re correlated with race or ethnicity, but they don\u2019t seem to be correlated with status,\u201d Frimpong said."

      "text": "Federal agents use Penske rental truck as \u2018Trojan Horse\u2019 to raid Los Angeles Home Depot\n- Share via\nA man driving a Penske truck pulled up to day laborers at the Home Depot and told them he was looking for workers, recalled one day laborer.\nThe workers gathered around, just as more than half a dozen Border Patrol agents jumped out the back. Many of the people scattered, but 16 were arrested in the operation.\nAfter weeks of relative quiet, the immigration raid on a Home Depot in Westlake early Wednesday morning revived fears of widespread sweeps in Los Angeles as U.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Greg Bovino warned, \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving.\u201d\nBovino, who has led operations since they began in June, referred to the raid as \u201cOperation Trojan Horse.\u201d\nImmigrant advocates and city leaders had hoped such sweeps had stopped with a federal judge\u2019s order, affirmed by a U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel, that immigration officials cannot racially profile people or use roving patrols to target immigrants.\n\u201cWe are all trying to look into ... exactly what happened,\u201d said Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. \u201cBut from the video and from the stills, it looks like the exact same thing that we were seeing before.\u201d\nIn her temporary restraining order, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong had ruled that using a person\u2019s race, language, job or location as a probable cause to detain them violated the 4th Amendment.\n- Share via\nFederal agents use Penske rental truck as \u2018Trojan Horse\u2019 to raid Los Angeles Home Depot.\n\u201cFor those who thought Immigration enforcement had stopped in Southern California, think again,\u201d acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli posted on X shortly after the raid. \u201cThe enforcement of federal law is not negotiable and there are no sanctuaries from the reach of the federal government.\u201d\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials released a short statement saying the operation led to \u201cthe arrest of 16 illegal aliens from Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras, and Nicaragua,\u201d and did not answer questions. They told a Fox News reporter that \u201cMS-13 has a chokehold on this area.\u201d However, agents appeared to arrest only day laborers and street vendors, who are often extorted by the gangs.\nWhen a reporter told Bass at a news conference that Border Patrol said it was targeting gang members, she replied sarcastically. \u201cYeah, and you can see that when somebody is sitting at a Home Depot.\u201d\nBass said later she wants City Atty. Hydee Feldstein Soto\u2019s office to determine whether the tactics used by federal agents during the Home Depot operation violated the restraining order.\n\u201cJust being a Home Depot day laborer, to me, is not probable cause,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the question I would have is, what were they possibly observing at Home Depot? They were observing people looking for a job for one day.\u201d\nThe Border Patrol changed one aspect of its approach. Instead of arriving in unmarked Ford and Chevy SUVs, agents showed up in vans that could be easily mistaken for those driven by workers, and the Penske truck, often used by people moving who need extra help. At least one van had a straw hat and orange construction vest sitting on the dashboard.\nThe 9th Circuit Court of Appeals dealt a stinging blow to the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation project Friday night, upholding a lower court\u2019s block on \u201croving patrols\u201d across much of Southern California.\nA day laborer, who identified himself as Cesar, said around 6:45 a.m. the Penske truck pulled up to laborers who had gathered in the parking lot. The driver told them in Spanish he was looking for workers.\nSeveral of the men gathered around the truck and then someone, it was unclear who, rolled up the back of the truck, Cesar recounted. Masked agents, one wearing a cowboy hat, jumped out and started chasing people. People scattered.\n\u201cThis is the worst feeling ever,\u201d said Cesar, who has been going to the home improvement store to pick up work for several years.\nVideo on social media captured the moment the back of the rental truck opened. When Penske Truck Rental was asked about it, the company said it was looking into it.\n\u201cThe company was not made aware that its trucks would be used in today\u2019s operation and did not authorize this,\u201d said Penske spokesman Randolph P. Ryerson. \u201cPenske will reach out to DHS and reinforce its policy to avoid improper use of its vehicles in the future.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cPenske strictly prohibits the transportation of people in the cargo area of its vehicles under any circumstances.\u201d\nThe majority of people held in the June immigration raids in Southern California were not criminals. Nearly half of them were Mexicans and most were men.\nAnna Cho, a member of the advocacy group LA Tenants Union, was setting up a booth at the Home Depot for renters in the dense, low-income Latino neighborhood to get information about their legal rights. Lately, she said, the group has become a de facto recorder of enforcement activity.\n\u201cIt was really chaotic,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lot of yelling. There was running, and when I went outside, the immigration officers were grabbing people. It was very indiscriminate. Some were resisting.\u201d\nIn a video shown to The Times, two white sprinter vans and the yellow Penske truck arrive at the parking lot. One of the vans can be seen blocking the Home Depot driveway on Union Avenue, in a move to apparently stop vehicles from driving out of the lot. The other van parks near a sidewalk where street vendors sell food.\nIn another video, masked men in Border Patrol uniforms can be seen leading a woman in an apron away from the folding table where she sold food and drinks. She was handcuffed and loaded into the van.\nA member of Tenants Union can be heard asking, \u201cDo you have a warrant?\u201d None of the agents responded.\n\u201cIt was so fast. It happened in a matter of 10 minutes,\u201d said Xochilt Soza, a mover who picks up work at the Home Depot. She saw several white vans drive into the lot, along with the Penske truck, and about 20 to 30 agents fan out of the vehicles. Agents arrested Angel, a man whom she knew for years and who was also looking for work.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so sad,\u201d she said, shaking her head in disbelief.\n\u201cI am not well,\u201d said another worker, who did not want to give his name. He said he was devastated by the raids but that he wasn\u2019t going to leave the parking lot, because he still needed the work.\nOne worker who escaped was still shaken by the experience an hour later. He identified himself as Raul and said he saw at least eight people get arrested.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of their cars,\u201d he said pointing to a silver Toyota sedan.\nThe Home Depot had been one of the scenes of the first raids in June that kicked off more than a month of operations in Southern California in which civil rights lawyers say federal agents indiscriminately arrested immigrants. The raids gutted businesses, spread fear and tore apart families.\nOn July 11, Judge Frimpong temporarily blocked federal agents from using racial profiling to carry out indiscriminate arrests after the ACLU, Public Counsel, other groups and private attorneys sued over the practices, saying the region had been \u201cunder siege.\u201d\nDepartment of Justice attorneys argued the order hindered them from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, but the 9th Circuit upheld the order.\nCity Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez, who represents the area, called Wednesday\u2019s operation \u201cyet another attack on our judicial system by the Trump Administration\u201d and said it was a \u201cclear violation of the temporary restraining order.\u201d\n\u201cUsing a rental truck to round up people like cargo is a disgusting reflection of this administration\u2019s total disregard for human life and the rule of law,\u201d Hernandez said in a statement. \u201cIt is clear that Angelenos \u2014 my constituents \u2014 are being racially profiled and hunted for political points.\u201d\nACLU attorney Mohammad Tajsar said the organization is reviewing reports of recent raids.\n\u201cThe evidence available so far raises serious concerns that the federal government may be in violation of the federal judge\u2019s July temporary restraining order,\u201d he said. \u201cWe encourage community members to reach out if they have any specific information about these incidents and we will continue to evaluate the evidence and alert the court at the appropriate juncture of any further unlawful actions.\u201d\nThis week, a federal judge approved a court settlement barring Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers from identifying as state or local law enforcement and from engaging in ruses misrepresenting their governmental identity or purpose, according to the ACLU. That settlement applies specifically to ICE.\nFor the last weeks since the restraining order kicked in, Bovino has shared photos of arrests of undocumented immigrants, stating that some had active arrest warrants. With others, he referenced a lengthy criminal history, marking the arrests as more targeted than they had been prior.\nBut organizers say similar operations to the Wednesday raid have unfolded in recent days and have sparked concerns about violations of the restraining order. On social media, people shared a video from Saturday of Border Patrol agents seemingly raiding a Lakewood Car Wash and taking at least two people into custody.\nAnother operation unfolded Monday at a Home Depot in Hollywood that was the site of a massive raid in June.\nMaegan Ortiz, the executive director of the nonprofit group Instituto de Educaci\u00f3n Popular del Sur de California, known as IDEPSCA, said it began receiving word about an immigration operation at the Home Depot in Hollywood around 6:50 a.m. She said at least two people were arrested.\nOrtiz said Border Patrol agents \u201cseem to be making the same rounds again.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re hitting the same places they hit Round 1, if you will, and they\u2019re trying new tactics,\u201d she said. She said they\u2019re pretending to be employers and luring people \u201cas if they\u2019re street vendors themselves.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does this mean for the TRO [temporary restraining order]? There\u2019s a lot of anxiety both from workers and from organizational staff,\u201d she said."

      "text": "- Share via\nA wildfire that broke out in the hills near the Los Angeles and Ventura county line amid a heat wave this week continued to grow Friday, forcing thousands to evacuate, destroying at least two buildings and challenging firefighters battling flames in extreme heat.\nThe Canyon fire, burning toward Castaic, had exploded to 5,400 acres by Friday afternoon, though officials reported it was 25% contained.\nTaking advantage of cooler temperatures Thursday night into Friday morning, crews were able to make some inroads against the fast-moving blaze that grew to several thousand acres in a matter of hours, said Ventura County Fire Department spokesperson Andrew Dowd. But he said the fight ahead remains challenging, given the hot weather, rugged terrain and a parched landscape that, together, can foster extreme fire growth.\n\u201cWe are seeing some flare-ups in various parts of the fire,\u201d Dowd said. \u201cWe still have record-low fuel moisture in the area, so we\u2019re not letting our guard\u201d down.\nTwo small structures, probably sheds or outbuildings, have been confirmed destroyed, Dowd said. Officials have not confirmed any homes or businesses damaged, but video from the scene showed a few buildings destroyed or engulfed in flames, though it wasn\u2019t immediately clear if that was additional damage from the two small buildings.\nResidents in the Val Verde area said flames were visible from the neighborhood\u2019s western edge Thursday, but the threat appeared to have calmed a bit by Friday morning, though the air remained thick with soot and ash.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of smoke. The air is really, really bad,\u201d Jennifer Elkins, president of the Val Verde Civic Assn., said Friday. Her neighborhood was under an evacuation order Thursday afternoon, but was able to return home Friday.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just kind of staying locked up indoors and keeping an eye on things,\u201d Elkins said. \u201cThis is a really tough fire season, and I\u2019m really glad the Fire Department is really taking every fire seriously. ... This is a pretty big threat to the community.\u201d\nThe Canyon fire quickly became one of the largest of several fires sparked during days of intense heat in Southern California. To the north in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, the much larger Gifford fire has burned nearly 100,000 acres.\nUnfortunately for firefighters on the ground, the heat is expected to persist into the weekend, though temperatures may drop a degree or two.\nTemperatures were forecast to peak Friday at 98 degrees around the Canyon fire, and that heat plus the winds, low humidity and parched landscape would continue to create elevated fire conditions through the weekend, said Mike Wofford, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Oxnard.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ripe for fires and fire spread,\u201d Wofford said.\n\u201cAlthough a few degrees of cooling is expected through the weekend, a very warm air mass will remain in place. An onshore flow regime will keep temperatures from exceeding record levels, but temperatures are expected to remain above seasonal normals as high pressure aloft lingers over the southwestern United States,\u201d the weather service said in a Friday morning forecast.\nVentura County officials said the fire broke out just before 2 p.m. Thursday \u2014 when temperatures were peaking around 100 degrees \u2014 near Holser Canyon Road, northeast of Piru, a small, unincorporated town not far from Castaic Junction.\nThe fire was initially reported to be about 30 acres, but within about two hours that estimate jumped to over 1,000 acres, according to Ventura County officials. By midnight, it had spread across 4,856 acres and was racing east toward Castaic and Interstate 5 in L.A. County.\nThe Canyon fire is threatening areas around Piru and Castiac. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\nAbout 2,500 residents and 700 structures remained under evacuation orders Friday afternoon, mostly in northern Los Angeles County near Castaic, while an additional 14,000 people and more than 4,700 structures were affected by evacuation warnings, according to Dowd.\nMore than 400 firefighters were assigned to the incident, according to fire officials.\nL.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger, who represents the Santa Clarita Valley, urged residents to heed evacuation alerts.\n\u201cExtreme heat and low humidity in our north county have created dangerous conditions where flames can spread with alarming speed,\u201d Barger said in a statement. \u201cIf first responders tell you to leave, go \u2014 without hesitation. The Eaton fire showed us how quickly devastation can strike.\u201d\nAn evacuation center was opened in the East Gymnasium of the College of the Canyons, at 26455 Rockwell Canyon Road in Santa Clarita.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union raised concerns about the fire\u2019s proximity to the Pitchess Detention Center, where about 5,000 inmates are housed in four jails. The center is east of the 5 Freeway and fell just outside an evacuation warning zone the first night of the fire.\nSenior staff attorney Melissa Camacho said she was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the growing fire.\n\u201cJanuary\u2019s Hughes fire burned within a half-mile of the jails and not a single person incarcerated there was evacuated,\u201d Camacho told The Times. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking that, less than eight months later, the 5,000 people in the jails and their loved ones will spend another sleepless night watching a fire and praying that it doesn\u2019t reach them.\u201d\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Department, which operates the facility, said it was actively monitoring fire conditions and was in constant communication with fire and county officials.\n\u201cSimilar to evacuation plans implemented at Pepperdine University in Malibu, the Fire Department has advised that a shelter-in-place strategy is the safest option for custody staff and inmates, given the building construction type and current fire behavior,\u201d agency spokesperson Nicole Nishida said in a statement. The area around the building has been cleared of brush and has wide defensible space, she said.\nGov. Gavin Newsom on Friday announced that the state had secured Federal Emergency Management Agency support to help pay for the fight against the blaze. The Fire Management Assistance Grant can provide federal funding for up to 75% of eligible firefighting costs, including expenses for field camps, equipment use, supplies and mobilization, and demobilization activities, according to FEMA."

      "text": "9th Circuit keeps freeze on Southern California ICE patrols\n- Share via\n- The ruling leaves in place a temporary restraining order barring masked and heavily armed agents from snatching people off the streets of Southern California without first establishing reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally.\n- The ruling scolded the Department of Justice for \u201cmisreading\u201d the restraining order it sought to block.\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dealt a stinging blow to the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation project Friday night in a fiery opinion upholding a lower court\u2019s block on \u201croving patrols\u201d across much of Southern California.\n\u201cIf, as Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion, they can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing a subset of stops not supported by reasonable suspicion,\u201d the panel wrote.\nThe ruling leaves in place a temporary restraining order barring masked and heavily armed agents from snatching people off the streets of Southern California without first establishing reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally.\nUnder the 4th Amendment, reasonable suspicion cannot be based solely on race, ethnicity, language, location or employment, either alone or in combination, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong of Los Angeles wrote in her original order.\nIn a searing ruling, a federal judge in Los Angeles temporarily blocked the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate sweeps in immigrant communities, saying they probably violate the 4th Amendment.\n9th Circuit Judges Marsha S. Berzon, Jennifer Sung and Ronald M. Gould agreed.\n\u201cThere is no predicate action that the individual plaintiffs would need to take, other than simply going about their lives, to potentially be subject to the challenged stops,\u201d the opinion said.\nFourth Amendment injunctions are hard to win, experts say. Plaintiffs must show not only that they were hurt, but that they are likely to be hurt again in the same way in the future.\nOne way to meet that test in court is to show the injury is the product of a government policy. Throughout a hearing Monday, the appellate judges repeatedly probed that question, roughly doubling the administration\u2019s time to respond in an effort to get an answer.\n\u201cAfter the district court injunction here, the secretary of Homeland Security said, \u2018We are going to continue doing what we\u2019re doing\u2019 \u2014 so that\u2019s not a policy?\u201d Berzon asked.\n\u201cThe policy is to follow the 4th Amendment and to require reasonable suspicion,\u201d said Deputy Assistant Atty. Gen. Yaakov Roth.\nThe appellate court battle over whether ICE can resume \u2018roving patrols\u2019 across the Los Angeles area hangs on dueling legal precedents that involve the LAPD and the CHP.\nRoth also rebuffed questions about a 3,000-arrests-per-day quota first touted by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller in May.\nIn a memo to the panel on Wednesday, Roth clarified that \u201cno such goal\u201d had been established.\nThe court rejected that argument Friday, writing that \u201cno official statement or express policy is required\u201d to prove one exists.\n\u201cAgents have conducted many stops in the Los Angeles area within a matter of weeks ... some repeatedly in the same location,\u201d the opinion said, making the likelihood of future stops \u201cconsiderable.\u201d\nThe ruling scolded the Department of Justice for \u201cmisreading\u201d the restraining order it sought to block, and said it \u201cmischaracterized\u201d Judge Frimpong\u2019s order. And it rejected the government\u2019s central claim that its law enforcement mandate would be \u201cchilled\u201d by the district court\u2019s order.\nAfter a federal judge in Los Angeles barred \u2018roving patrols\u2019 by immigration agents in seven California counties, the Trump administration asked the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to resume operations that lawyers for the state have argued are unconstitutional.\n\u201cDefendants have failed to establish that they will be \u2018chilled\u2019 from their enforcement efforts at all, let alone in a manner that constitutes the \u2018irreparable injury\u2019 required to support a stay pending appeal,\u201d the panel wrote.\nThe case is still in its early phases, with hearings set for a preliminary injunction in September. But the \u201cshock and awe\u201d campaign of chaotic public arrests that first gripped Southern California on June 6 has all but ceased in the seven counties covered by Frimpong\u2019s order: Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo.\n\u201cThe underlying 4th Amendment law is not complicated,\u201d said Mohammad Tajsar of the ACLU of Southern California \u2014 part of a coalition of civil rights groups and individual attorneys challenging cases of three immigrants and two U.S. citizens swept up in chaotic arrests. \u201cEven a more conservative panel would have been concerned about what the government is doing.\u201d\nIn the long shadow of his policies, renewed attention is being paid to Miller\u2019s upbringing in the famously liberal enclave once dubbed \u201cthe People\u2019s Republic of Santa Monica.\u201d\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, whose city was among a number of Southern California municipalities allowed to join the lawsuit this week, celebrated the news at a hastily arranged news conference late Friday night at Getty House, her official residence in Windsor Square.\nThe mayor strode out of the Tudor Revival-style home and toward the bank of waiting television cameras with a purposeful smile.\n\u201cThis is a great day for Los Angeles,\u201d she said, characterizing the court\u2019s decision as a victory upholding the Constitution and affirming the rule of law.\nUpholding the temporary restraining order \u201cmeans that people cannot be snatched off the street by masked men like we had experienced for almost two months in the city,\u201d Bass said, referencing the fact that the increasingly aggressive raids have often been carried out by masked agents who sometimes use unmarked vehicles.\nBass, whose late husband was Latino and whose late daughter, stepchildren and grandchildren are of Latino descent, has described the raids as deeply personal.\nSpeaking directly to the city\u2019s immigrant community, Bass was sanguine about the possibility that the terror paralyzing local communities might begin to ebb.\n\u201cThe message that I have is that I hope that feeling of fear will subside, that people will be willing and able to come out of their homes, that people will be able to go back to work, that our economy will begin to pick up again,\u201d Bass said.\nThe Trump administration has previously signaled its intent to fight judicial limits on its deportation efforts any way it can. It was not immediately clear where an appeal would proceed. Bass said she believed the administration would likely appeal to the Supreme Court."

  "argos_summary": "Federal agents conducted immigration raids outside a Home Depot in Los Angeles, detaining day laborers and raising concerns about potential violations of a court order against racial profiling. The operations, described as 'Operation Trojan Horse,' involved agents using a Penske truck to blend in with workers, leading to accusations of indiscriminate arrests targeting Latino communities. Despite a temporary restraining order barring such tactics, federal officials defended their actions, claiming they were legally justified, while local leaders and advocates expressed outrage and called for investigations into the raids.",
