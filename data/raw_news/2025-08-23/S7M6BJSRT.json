  "content": "Personal loans can be a smart alternative to credit cards, often offering lower interest rates and a chance to build or strengthen your credit. Your own bank or credit union may have competitive options, but shopping around is key to getting the best rate.\n\nFind Out: 4 Moves to Make if You Can\u2019t Pay All Your Bills this Month\n\nRead Next: 6 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025\n\nBefore you borrow, it helps to understand the biggest factors that determine what rate you\u2019ll pay. Here are seven key things you need to know about personal loans.\n\nInterest rates on personal loans are determined by larger economic forces and the individual borrower\u2019s credit history and score. Some of the factors that have the biggest impact are:\n\u2022 Economic environment: Federal Reserve policy, inflation and overall credit market conditions drive rates up and down.\n\u2022 Lender\u2019s risk tolerance: Rates also reflect the lender\u2019s own costs, operational overhead and their risk tolerance for potential loss if a borrower defaults.\n\nCheck Out: 8 Smart Ways Frugal People Are Living Like There\u2019s Already a Recession\n\nCredit Score Has a Big Impact on Your Rate\n\nOf all these factors, credit score plays a big role in the rate you\u2019ll be offered, as it\u2019s the lender\u2019s way of understanding their level of risk in loaning you money.\n\nHigher credit scores (670 and up) may qualify for lower rates, while those with scores in the fair (580 to 669) to poor (below 580) credit tiers may see significantly higher interest rates.\n\nThe loan length determines how quickly or slowly you\u2019ll repay the money you\u2019ve borrowed and will also affect how much interest you pay. Shorter-term loans (24 to 36 months) tend to come with lower rates as a kind of incentive for the likely lower risk the lender is taking. Thus, longer-term loans (60 to 84 months) tend to come with higher interest, since there\u2019s a greater likelihood of missed or defaulted payments the longer you have to pay it back.\n\nWhile a longer-term loan often results in a lower monthly payment, over the life of that loan you\u2019re paying a lot more in interest.\n\nFor example: A $10,000 loan at 10% over three years costs around $1,600 in interest. The same loan at 12% over seven years will cost you around $4,800, additionally \u2014 a significant amount of money.\n\nThere are two main ways that interest can be applied to your loan, either fixed-rate or variable-rate loans.\n\u2022 Fixed-rate loans: Your interest rate stays the same over the life of the loan, which keeps things simple and predictable.\n\u2022 Variable-rate loans: These loans are tied to benchmarks like \u201cthe prime rate.\u201d They may start out lower than fixed loans but can rise if interest rates increase, which is risky and makes it harder to predict payments and interest accrued.\n\nFixed-rate loans are the safest for the average borrower because there are no surprises, and you can even get ahead and make additional or bigger payments.\n\nEven if the interest rate on a loan looks great, always take a closer look and read the fine print. Fees can drive up the rate you\u2019re actually paying, such as:\n\u2022 Origination fees: Often 1% to 8% of the loan amount\n\u2022 Prepayment penalties: Some lenders still charge for early payoff of loans, though it is not as common.\n\nHow To Shop for the Best Rates Without Hurting Credit\n\nBorrowers have to be careful when shopping for a loan so that it doesn\u2019t show up on your credit report. Some tricks to do this include:\n\u2022 Use prequalification tools: Soft credit pulls are a way to rate-shop without affecting your credit score.\n\u2022 Compare lenders: Online tools exist to help you compare rates at banks, credit unions and fintech lenders. Credit unions often offer lower-than-average rates.\n\u2022 Consider co-signers or co-borrowers: If there\u2019s someone with excellent credit who is willing to partner with you to obtain a loan, this can often reduce your rate.\n\nIf a loan and rate seem a little too good to be true upfront, and even if they seem right on target, always look into the fine print for details that can add costs or change your payments. Some things to doublecheck include:\n\u2022 APR vs. interest rate: Your annual percentage rate (APR) includes interest and some fees, but not always all costs. Always compare APRs not just the headline rate.\n\u2022 Penalty clauses: Late fees, prepayment restrictions or variable rate adjustments can balloon the cost of a loan.\n\u2022 Total repayment cost: Calculate how much you\u2019ll pay in full \u2014 not just the monthly payment\n\nThe \u201cbest\u201d personal loan isn\u2019t just the lowest advertised rate, it\u2019s the one with the lowest total overall cost, the best repayment terms and the one that fits your financial plan. By comparing offers carefully and reading the fine print, you can borrow wisely and avoid paying more than you need to.\n\u2022 6 Costco Products That Have the Most Customer Complaints\n\u2022 This is the Most Frugal Generation (Hint: It's Not Boomers)\n\u2022 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up to $1K Per Month From Home\n\u2022 5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 7 Things You Need To Know About Personal Loan Interest Rates",

  "summary": "Personal loans, often cheaper than credit cards, offer lower interest rates and a chance to strengthen your credit. Interest rates are determined by economic forces and the individual borrower's credit history and score. Factors such as Federal Reserve policy, inflation, and overall credit market conditions drive rates up and down. The length of the loan will also affect how quickly or slowly you repay the money borrowed. Higher credit scores (670 and up) may qualify for lower rates, while lower scores (580 to 669) to poor (below 580) credit tiers may see higher interest rates. Fixed-rate or variable-rate loans are the safest for the average borrower, as their interest rate stays consistent throughout the loan life. However, fees can increase the rate, such as origination fees and prepayment penalties.",

      "text": "Why Are My Credit Scores Different? Here\u2019s What You Need To Know\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nYour credit score isn\u2019t assigned by banks or credit issuers. Instead, credit bureaus, such as Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, give you a number based on factors like payment history, amounts owed, length of account history and more.\nEach bureau collects and reports data independently. In other words, they don\u2019t share your information. Not all credit bureaus have the same information. This can lead to a different score with each bureau.\nDifferent Credit Scoring Models\nThere are two scoring models for personal credit scores:\nThe most widely used credit score is FICO. It examines five factors, each of which makes up a different percentage of your overall score:\n- Payment history: 35%\n- Credit utilization: 30%\n- Average age of accounts: 15%\n- Credit mix: 10%\n- New credit: 10%\nThen there\u2019s VantageScore, an alternative model with slightly different calculations. VantageScore factors include:\n- Payment history: 41%\n- Depth of credit: 20%\n- Credit utilization: 20%\n- Recent credit: 11%\n- Balances: 6%\n- Available credit: 2%\nIn short, FICO is more important than VantageScore because it\u2019s the most widely used model for approving your application.\nWhy Are My Credit Scores Different?\nThere are several reasons you have a different credit score from each credit bureau.\nDifferences Between Credit Bureaus\nIt\u2019s not that the three major credit bureaus aren\u2019t reliable. They score you based on the information that they have. The problem is that they don\u2019t always have the same information.\nHere\u2019s why: Credit bureaus rely on credit card issuers to report your activity to them. Some credit card issuers, like Capital One, report to all three credit bureaus. Not all issuers do this, however. Some report to just one or two. Because of this, one credit bureau may see lots of great payment history and low credit utilization, while another may have no idea how you\u2019re using that particular card.\nSomething as simple as a bit of missing data can cause your credit score to vary greatly across different sites.\nDifferent Scoring Models Used by Websites\nSites use specific scoring models based on their risk assessment needs. FICO and VantageScore offer different versions to lenders.\nFor example, your FICO score may be based around FICO 8, 9, 10 or 10T.\nTiming of Credit Report Updates\nYour credit report isn\u2019t updated in real time. Lenders generally report your activity to the credit bureaus once per month. That means your credit score is usually behind.\nFor example, if you\u2019ve had a high credit utilization of 60%, your credit score is likely suffering. But even if you were to pay your credit cards off today, you might not see a change in your credit score for weeks.\nFortunately, credit bureaus typically update your credit score quickly after your lender has contacted them.\nSoft vs. Hard Credit Inquiries\nWhen you apply for a line of credit, the lender may do a hard inquiry or hard pull to take a look at your credit score. This can make your credit score temporarily go down a few points.\nA soft inquiry or pull happens during background checks for apartments or you look at your own credit score \u2014 which you should do regularly.\nHow To Interpret Your Credit Scores Accurately\nHere\u2019s an overview of how to evaluate your credit score.\nFocus on Score Range, Not Exact Number\nYour exact credit score doesn\u2019t matter as much as the \u201crange\u201d your score lives in. Lenders will often approve you based on your score range.\nFICO has the following five ranges:\n- 800 to 850: Excellent\n- 740 to 799: Very Good\n- 670 to 739: Good\n- 580 to 669: Fair\n- 300 to 579: Poor\nYour credit score can fluctuate, but as long as you\u2019re not dropping down to a lower range, everything\u2019s fine.\nFor example, if your credit is in the \u201cgood\u201d range, you won\u2019t have much of a problem opening just about any credit card. If it\u2019s in the \u201cfair\u201d range, you\u2019ll be relegated to mostly credit-builder credit cards.\nCheck Scores from a Trusted Source\nWhen checking your credit score, use official sites like Experian.com and TransUnion.com. You can also check out AnnualCreditReport.com, which gives you a free report each year.\nMany banks and credit cards also offer credit monitoring, giving you a monthly or quarterly snapshot of your score. You can find it in your online account.\nMonitor Changes Over Time\nBanks and credit bureaus do their best to keep you informed of fraud, but the strongest preventative measure you can take is to manually keep an eye on your accounts.\nYou don\u2019t have to pore through transactions every day. Focus on trends instead. If your credit score sharply decreases, take a look at your credit report to find any anomalies.\nFor example, a new account may have been fraudulently opened in your name. Or you may have somehow forgotten to make a payment on a credit card.\nHow To Maintain a Strong Credit Score Across All Platforms\nTo keep your credit score strong, you need to understand which factors impact your score the most, namely:\n- Payment history: The single best thing you can do for your score is to pay your bills on time.\n- Credit utilization: Experts recommend that you keep your debt below 30% of your total available credit.\n- Average age of accounts: Avoid opening too many new accounts at once.\nAgain, monitoring your own accounts regularly is a critical, if annoying, part of maintaining a strong credit score.\nCredit Scores and Why They're Different: FAQ\nHere are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about why your credit score might be different on different sites.- Why is my FICO score different from my VantageScore?\n- Your FICO score is different from your VantageScore because they are weighted differently. Both examine similar aspects of your credit profile, but each factor makes up a different percentage of your overall score.\n- How often do credit scores update?\n- Credit scores may be updated multiple times per month. Creditors tend to report your activity to the credit bureaus once per month, but they don't do it on the same day. Once a credit bureau has received new information about your activity, it will update your credit report -- and your credit score.\n- Which credit score do lenders use the most?\n- Lenders use the FICO credit scoring model the most when it comes to approving a loan. VantageScore is often used for prequalification or preapproval, for a credit card or an apartment rental, as examples.\n- Can I have different credit scores for different types of loans?\n- You can have different credit scores for different loan types. Lenders may pull previous FICO models for mortgages, for example. FICO can even tweak scores based on the account you're trying to open. For example, FICO Auto Scores examine your standard FICO score and then weigh it against the unique risk involved with auto loans.\n- How can I check my credit score for free?\n- You can check your credit score for free by visiting sites like Credit Karma and Credit Sesame. Opening an account is free, and your score will be updated periodically throughout the month. You can also check your bank or credit card's online account -- many of which offer FICO score monitoring as a free benefit."

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nPersonal loans can be a smart alternative to credit cards, often offering lower interest rates and a chance to build or strengthen your credit. Your own bank or credit union may have competitive options, but shopping around is key to getting the best rate.\nBefore you borrow, it helps to understand the biggest factors that determine what rate you\u2019ll pay. Here are seven key things you need to know about personal loans.\nThese Factors Determine Personal Loan Interest Rates\nInterest rates on personal loans are determined by larger economic forces and the individual borrower\u2019s credit history and score. Some of the factors that have the biggest impact are:\n- Economic environment: Federal Reserve policy, inflation and overall credit market conditions drive rates up and down.\n- Lender\u2019s risk tolerance: Rates also reflect the lender\u2019s own costs, operational overhead and their risk tolerance for potential loss if a borrower defaults.\n- Borrower-specific factors: Lenders evaluate individual borrowers\u2019 credit scores, debt-to-income (DTI) ratio employment status and repayment history.\nCredit Score Has a Big Impact on Your Rate\nOf all these factors, credit score plays a big role in the rate you\u2019ll be offered, as it\u2019s the lender\u2019s way of understanding their level of risk in loaning you money.\nHigher credit scores (670 and up) may qualify for lower rates, while those with scores in the fair (580 to 669) to poor (below 580) credit tiers may see significantly higher interest rates.\nLoan Length Affects Interest Rates\nThe loan length determines how quickly or slowly you\u2019ll repay the money you\u2019ve borrowed and will also affect how much interest you pay. Shorter-term loans (24 to 36 months) tend to come with lower rates as a kind of incentive for the likely lower risk the lender is taking. Thus, longer-term loans (60 to 84 months) tend to come with higher interest, since there\u2019s a greater likelihood of missed or defaulted payments the longer you have to pay it back.\nWhile a longer-term loan often results in a lower monthly payment, over the life of that loan you\u2019re paying a lot more in interest.\nFor example: A $10,000 loan at 10% over three years costs around $1,600 in interest. The same loan at 12% over seven years will cost you around $4,800, additionally \u2014 a significant amount of money.\nFixed vs. Variable Rates\nThere are two main ways that interest can be applied to your loan, either fixed-rate or variable-rate loans.\n- Fixed-rate loans: Your interest rate stays the same over the life of the loan, which keeps things simple and predictable.\n- Variable-rate loans: These loans are tied to benchmarks like \u201cthe prime rate.\u201d They may start out lower than fixed loans but can rise if interest rates increase, which is risky and makes it harder to predict payments and interest accrued.\nFixed-rate loans are the safest for the average borrower because there are no surprises, and you can even get ahead and make additional or bigger payments.\nFees and Hidden Costs\nEven if the interest rate on a loan looks great, always take a closer look and read the fine print. Fees can drive up the rate you\u2019re actually paying, such as:\n- Origination fees: Often 1% to 8% of the loan amount\n- Late fees: Flat fees or a percentage of payment amount\n- Prepayment penalties: Some lenders still charge for early payoff of loans, though it is not as common.\nHow To Shop for the Best Rates Without Hurting Credit\nBorrowers have to be careful when shopping for a loan so that it doesn\u2019t show up on your credit report. Some tricks to do this include:\n- Use prequalification tools: Soft credit pulls are a way to rate-shop without affecting your credit score.\n- Compare lenders: Online tools exist to help you compare rates at banks, credit unions and fintech lenders. Credit unions often offer lower-than-average rates.\n- Consider co-signers or co-borrowers: If there\u2019s someone with excellent credit who is willing to partner with you to obtain a loan, this can often reduce your rate.\nRead the Fine Print\nIf a loan and rate seem a little too good to be true upfront, and even if they seem right on target, always look into the fine print for details that can add costs or change your payments. Some things to doublecheck include:\n- APR vs. interest rate: Your annual percentage rate (APR) includes interest and some fees, but not always all costs. Always compare APRs not just the headline rate.\n- Penalty clauses: Late fees, prepayment restrictions or variable rate adjustments can balloon the cost of a loan.\n- Total repayment cost: Calculate how much you\u2019ll pay in full \u2014 not just the monthly payment\nThe \u201cbest\u201d personal loan isn\u2019t just the lowest advertised rate, it\u2019s the one with the lowest total overall cost, the best repayment terms and the one that fits your financial plan. By comparing offers carefully and reading the fine print, you can borrow wisely and avoid paying more than you need to."

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nIf you\u2019re comparing a credit union vs. bank, you\u2019re not alone. While both offer savings accounts, checking accounts and loan options, they operate under different business models. Banks are for-profit, while credit unions are not-for-profit institutions that return profits to members. This distinction can impact everything from your interest rates to the service you receive.\nThis guide breaks down the major differences so you can decide which is the better fit for your financial needs.\nCredit Union vs. Banks: A Quick Comparison\nOn the surface, the differences between credit unions vs. banks might be difficult to spot.\nHere\u2019s a side-by-side look at how they compare:\n| Feature | Credit Unions | Banks |\n|---|---|---|\n| Business Model | Not-for-profit | For-profit |\n| Membership | Must meet eligibility requirements | Open to all |\n| Deposit Rates | Generally higher | Generally lower |\n| Loan Rates | Typically lower | Typically higher |\n| Fees | Usually lower | Often higher |\n| Branch Network | More limited, but shared branching available | Wide branch and ATM access |\n| Technology | May lag behind | Often more advanced |\n| Customer Focus | Member-owned, personalized service | Customer-based, more standardized service |\n| Insurance | NCUA insured | FDIC insured |\nCredit Union Pros and Cons\nWhen trying to decide if a credit union might be right for you, it can help to weigh the advantages and disadvantages.\nPros\n- Member-focused, not-for-profit model\n- Lower fees and better interest rates\n- Strong local and community involvement\n- Personalized customer service\nCons\n- Must meet membership eligibility requirements\n- Fewer branches and service options\n- Technology may not be as advanced\nBank Pros and Cons\nHere\u2019s what to know if you\u2019re leaning toward a traditional bank:\nPros\n- More locations and ATMs nationwide\n- Typically faster to adopt new technology\n- More financial products and services\n- No membership requirements\nCons\n- Higher fees and loan interest rates\n- Lower returns on savings\n- Less personalized customer service\nHow Membership and Access Works\nWhile banks are open to anyone who can meet basic requirements \u2014 like providing a valid ID and an initial deposit \u2014 credit unions have specific membership criteria. Here\u2019s how access typically works:\nCredit Unions\n- Eligibility may be based on where you live, work, or your family or employer affiliation.\n- A small deposit is often required to open a new account.\n- Some require you to purchase a small share to become a member and part-owner.\nBanks\n- Generally available to all consumers.\n- Easy account setup with ID and initial deposit.\n- No eligibility restrictions or membership fees.\nInterest Rates and Fees\nBanks make money by charging interest on loans and offering lower returns on deposits. Credit unions reinvest profits in their members, which can result in:\n- Lower loan rates\n- Higher interest on savings and CDs\n- Fewer fees \u2014 or easier ways to waive them\nStill, online banks are worth comparing, as they often offer high-yield savings accounts that may outperform even credit unions.\nProduct and Service Offerings\nBanks and credit unions offer slightly different products and services. Here\u2019s a closer look:\nCredit Unions\n- Basic banking services like savings, checking, auto loans and sometimes mortgages.\n- Limited variety of credit cards and investment products.\nBanks\n- Wide range of financial products including credit cards, home loans, investments and wealth management.\n- More likely to offer everything in one place.\nTechnology and Accessibility\nTechnology can vary significantly when comparing a credit union vs. banks.\n- Credit unions tend to have smaller branches and ATM networks.\n- Many participate in shared branching networks, which allow members to access their accounts at other participating credit unions.\n- Although credit union technology has a lot of catching up to do, many credit unions are now offering improved digital banking platforms and features to meet customer demands.\n- Banks generally have a larger physical presence with widespread branches and extensive ATM networks.\n- Banks provide more advanced mobile apps and cutting-edge digital tools, offering features like real-time alerts and integrated budgeting options.\nCustomer Service and Community Impact\nCredit unions are known for their personalized customer service, often building close relationships with their members and providing tailored financial products and services. They also focus on giving back to their local communities through charitable initiatives and member-focused programs.\nBanks, on the other hand, offer standardized services to serve their larger and more diverse customer bases efficiently. Their size allows them to provide extensive resources but can result in less personalized interactions compared to credit unions.\nSafety and Insurance\nWhether you decide to work with a multinational banking institution or a small local credit union, your money is equally safe.\nThe federal government insures them both through different organizations.\n- The FDIC insures bank accounts.\n- The NCUA insures credit union accounts.\nHow To Choose: Bank vs. Credit Union\nWhen deciding between a credit union vs. bank, consider the following:\n- Service availability: Do they offer the features you need now and in the future?\n- Branch and ATM access: Are branch and ATM locations convenient for you?\n- Technology: Do you prefer a robust mobile app or digital tools?\n- Fees and interest: Would you benefit more from lower fees or better deposit rates?\nFinal Take\nBanks and credit unions both have their place in today\u2019s financial ecosystem. Banks often offer services credit unions don\u2019t, while credit unions keep costs low. Consider the pros and cons of each when trying to determine which is best for your financial situation.\nFAQ\nHere are the answers to commonly asked questions about how credit unions and banks compare.- Are credit unions better safer than banks?\n- Both credit unions and banks are insured. Credit unions are insured by the NCUA, while banks are insured by the FDIC. Both provide similar protections for your deposits.\n- Do credit unions have better interest rates than banks?\n- Credit unions usually offer lower loan rates and higher savings rates than banks because they focus on benefiting their members instead of making profits.\n- Can anyone join a credit union?\n- Membership rules depend on the credit union. Many require a connection like work, location or membership in a group, but some have easy eligibility requirements.\n- What are the drawbacks of using a credit union?\n- Credit unions may have fewer branches, less advanced technology and a limited range of services compared to traditional banks.\n- How do bank fees compare to credit union fees?\n- Credit unions typically have lower fees than banks. They aim to save members money, while banks focus on generating profits.\nElizabeth Constantineau contributed to the reporting for this article.\nOur in-house research team and on-site financial experts work together to create content that\u2019s accurate, impartial, and up to date.

You\u2019ve worked hard and pinched pennies to finally get to the point where your savings account is looking solid. Now it\u2019s time for the emphasis to shift from saving to making your money work more actively.\nThese moves just might be what you need to keep your money growing. Best of all? It only takes a few minutes to check them out and see which ones are best for you.\nUse an Annuity to Earn Guaranteed Growth on Your Retirement Savings\nOnce you have a substantial nest egg, it's smart to start thinking about your long-term goals and how you can protect what you've built against the unknown -- like a stock market downturn tanking your 401(k) before retirement.\nThat's where an annuity can come in -- they can provide a guaranteed stream of income during retirement at a fixed rate. No stock-market risk involved.\nYou can get started with a Gainbridge\u00ae FastBreak\u2122 annuity with a minimum investment of just $1,000. The more you invest, the higher rate you can earn -- up to 5.80% APY**. The best part? There's no risk to your investment.\nFor context, 5.80% APY is more than 13 times* the average rate on a savings account. Plus, your principal amount is fully protected, unlike when you invest in the stock market.\nThe FastBreak\u2122 annuity is self-directed, easy to set up and comes with 30 days to cancel your contract if you change your mind. Plus you can access up to 10% of your money each year without penalties -- even if you're under 59\u00bd.\nLooking for a predictable, stable way to grow your retirement savings without risking any of your principal investment? Get started here with as little as $1,000 to earn 5.50% APY, or deposit more to earn up to 5.80% APY.\nThey Know You Can Earn Up to a $500 Bonus -- And Boost Your Savings Rate By 10x\nIf you're keeping your dough in a traditional checking account, you're not letting it rise to its full potential. You need an account that lets you earn competitive interest on your everyday balance.\nRaisin, a digital marketplace, makes it easy to find a high-yield savings account with an APY as high as 4.31% -- that's more than 10 times the national average interest on a savings account, which pays just 0.38% APY as of June 16, 2025.\nPlus, when you open an account and deposit funds, you can earn a welcome bonus of up to $500. The more you deposit, the more you can earn.\nThere are no fees from Raisin, and they already have 1 million customers and a 4.5 star rating on Trustpilot.\nWant to start growing your money more than 11 times faster -- and earn up to a $500 bonus?

And we're not exactly dying to be landlords, either.\nLuckily, a company called Arrived lets you invest in rental homes and vacation properties with a minimum investment of just $1,000. The best part? You don't even have to be a landlord. Arrived handles all the nitty gritty work.\nThe process is simple.

Between the pandemic, supply-chain issues and bear markets, a lot of people's retirement savings felt the impact.\nThat's why it can be a smart idea to look for ways to protect your retirement savings from the unpredictable. For a lot of people, investing in precious metals is a way to diversify and protect their investments.\nOne way to do this is with a precious metals IRA through a company like Priority Gold. Precious metals often outperform other investments in a volatile market, and their value tends to rise with inflation, making them an effective hedge during uncertain economic times.\nOpening a gold or silver IRA is easy, and you can roll over funds from existing retirement accounts without any taxes or penalty fees. Or you can buy gold and silver directly from Priority Gold's extensive collection.\nWorried you may need to sell your precious metals in the future? Priority Gold offers a no-fee buy-back program.

The professionals simply know things we don't.\nBut the idea of getting a financial advisor sounds expensive and tedious. That's why we like a company called WiserAdvisor.

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nThere\u2019s no single best place to get a personal loan \u00eb the best place for you depends on your credit and income, the amount you need to borrow, and how quickly you want the money.\nHowever, you do have several options for where to go, including banks, credit unions and online lenders. The right choice will depend on your circumstances.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about where you can get a personal loan.\nWhere You Can Get a Personal Loan\nThe table below outlines the options for getting a personal loan and how they differ.\n| Lender | How Fast | What You Need | Good For |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Bank | 1 to 5 days | Good credit, steady job | Larger loans, lower rates |\n| Credit Union | 1 to 7 days | May need to join first | Lower rates, friendly service |\n| Online Lender | Same day and up to 3 days | Fair credit, proof of income | Fast approval, easy to apply |\n| Loan App | In a few minutes and up to one day | Basic info | Small loans, emergencies |\n| Peer-to-Peer Lending | 3 to 7 days | Credit check | Those who don\u2019t want to use a bank |\nBanks\nIf you already have a relationship with a bank and have good credit and proof of income, you can start there. Banks typically offer competitive rates, and some banks offer a better rate if you also have a checking or savings account, or both with them.\nHere are some examples:\nWells Fargo\nWells Fargo offers personal loans with interest rates as low as 6.74% APR for a $10,000, 3-year loan if you have been a customer for at least 12 months and sign up for automatic payments.\nTD Bank\nTD Bank offers personal loans for $2,000 to $50,000, with interest rates ranging from 8.99% to 23.99% APR. Loan terms range from 36 to 60 months.\nA bank may be your best option if you have good or excellent credit, and if you are or can become a customer.\nCredit Unions\nCredit unions can often offer lower rates than banks, as well as more flexible terms. Credit unions are owned by their members, so rates tend to be lower. You must be a member of a credit union to use its services, including getting a personal loan. Some, but not all, credit unions restrict membership to certain groups or geographic locations.\nPenFed Credit Union\nPenFed Credit Union offers personal loans for up to $50,000 with terms up to 60 months, with interest rates starting at 8.99% APR. You have to be a PenFed member, but membership is open to anyone.\nFirst Tech Federal Credit Union\nFirst Tech Federal Credit Union personal loan rates start at 7.89% APR for up to $50,000. You must be a credit union member. Membership is open to employees of over 900 tech companies, residents of Oregon, and family or household members of current members.\nA credit union may be your best option if you are or qualify to become a member and have good credit and employment history.\nGood To Know\nThe National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) caps the interest rate credit unions can charge at 18% APR, so your rate will never be higher than that.\nOnline Lenders\nOnline lenders offer fast approval \u2014 often the same day. It\u2019s easy to compare rates among online lenders as the application process is quick and easy. If you have excellent credit, online lenders offer very good rates, but if your credit is poor, the rates can be very high.\nSoFi\u00ae\nSoFi offers personal loans with terms from two to seven years. Rates range from 8.99% APR to 35.49% APR. These rates require that you have autopay and direct deposit with SoFi.\nUpstart\nUpstart offers personal loans in amounts from $1,000 to $50,000 and terms of three or five years. Interest rates range from 6.60% to 35.99% APR. Upstart charges an origination fee that is deducted from the loan amount that is disbursed, so be sure to factor that in.\nAn online lender may be your best choice if you want to get your money in a hurry or want to easily compare rates from multiple lenders.\nLoan Apps\nLoan apps can provide quick cash in a pinch. Sometimes referred to as \u201cpayday loans,\u201d these apps advance you money based on previous direct deposit activity in your checking account. These apps are best for small loans or quick cash to hold you over until payday.\nBrigit\nBrigit is a subscription service that links to your bank account and lets you get cash quickly based on your direct deposit activity. You pay $8.99 or $14.99 per month for the ability to borrow against your future direct deposit.\nWhen you request an advance, you select the date that Brigit will withdraw the funds to pay back the advance. The maximum advance amount is $250, but not everyone qualifies for that amount.\nEarnin\nEarnin is a payday advance app that can pay you early. You link it to your bank account, and you can access your direct deposit two days earlier for a fee of $2.99. You can access up to $150 per day or $750 per pay period.\nLoan apps are best for those who cannot qualify for a traditional loan or just need a little cash ahead of payday.\nPeer-to-Peer Platforms\nPeer-to-peer lending platforms take money from investors and loan it out to borrowers. The interest the borrowers pay goes back to the investors, after covering the platform\u2019s costs. They often charge an origination fee, so be sure to add that into your calculations if you\u2019re comparing rates.\nProsper\nProsper offers peer-to-peer loans with interest rates ranging from 8.99% to 35.99% APR and an origination fee ranging from 1% to 9.99% of the amount of the loan. Your credit score must be at least 640 to qualify for a loan from Prosper.\nLendingClub\nLendingClub provides personal loans with interest rates that range from 7.90% to 35.99% APR, with an origination fee ranging from 0 to 8.00%.\nA peer-to-peer lending company may be best for you if you like the idea of borrowing from a person instead of a bank, and don\u2019t mind paying an origination fee.\nCan I Get a Personal Loan Without Being a Member of a Bank?\nYou can get a personal loan even if you don\u2019t already have an account at the bank, but you may get a better rate if you have or open a deposit account, e.g., checking or savings.\nCredit unions require you to be a member before you can get a loan. This may be a simple as opening a shared savings account with $5, or you may have to qualify by working in a certain field or living in a particular area.\nOnline lenders don\u2019t usually have these kinds of requirements, so you can often get a personal loan without having another account there.\nTip: Some banks offer better terms to existing customers \u2014 it may be worth checking both.\nWhat To Look for in a Lender\nThese are some things to keep an eye on when you\u2019re researching a lender.\nAPR\nWhen evaluating lenders for a personal loan, look for a low annual percentage rate (APR), but be sure you\u2019re comparing your rate at each lender. You may not qualify for the lowest rate.\nFees\nLook for origination fees, prepayment penalties and other fees. Lenders that have these may still be your best choice, but be sure you factor them in.\nFind Out How Long It Takes\nIf you need the money in a hurry, check to see how long approval and disbursement take. Some lenders can get you funds the same or the next day.\nCheck Reviews\nLenders will always put their best foot forward on their website, so pay attention to what customers have to say.\nIs a Personal Loan Right for You?\nA personal loan might be a good fit for you if you need a lump sum of money fast, you want to consolidate high-interest debt like credit cards, and you have a plan and the income to make the payments on time.\nIt might not be wise for you to get a personal loan if you won\u2019t be able to afford the monthly payment, you don\u2019t have a good reason for needing the money, or you already have a lot of debt.\nHow To Apply for a Personal Loan\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to applying for a personal loan.\n- Check your credit score. Request a credit report from the three credit bureaus and check for inaccuracies.\n- Compare lenders and get prequalified if you can. You want to apply to only one lender if possible.\n- Choose your loan amount and term. Make sure the payments will be affordable for you.\n- Gather the necessary documents. You\u2019ll need identification, like a driver\u2019s license or passport, and proof of your income, such as pay stubs or a tax return. Some lenders may have additional requirements.\n- Submit your application either online or in person. When you apply, the lender will do a \u201csoft\u201d credit pull, meaning they will check your credit score in such a way that it does not impact your score. Once approved, they will do a \u201chard\u201d pull, which will impact your score. For this reason, you don\u2019t want to apply to multiple lenders at once.\nFinal Thoughts: Pros and Cons of Each Personal Loan Option\nWhen shopping for a personal loan, make sure you choose the be one for your specific situation. If you have a banking or credit union relationship already, that may be the best choice for you if your interest rate is comparable.\nIf you\u2019re in a hurry to get your funds, an online lender may be your best option. For short-term, small money needs, a lending app could be the way to go. A peer-to-peer platform may be the best choice if you don\u2019t want to work with a bank.\nThe best loan for you is the one that provides you with the funds you need, and that you are able to pay back as agreed.\nFAQs About Getting a Personal Loan\nHere are answers to some of your most frequently asked questions about getting a personal loan.- How fast can I get a personal loan?\n- Some lenders can approve your loan and send you the money the same day, or the following day. Others may take a few days or weeks to evaluate your application and send the funds.\n- Can I apply with bad credit?\n- You can, but if your credit is poor, you may not get approved. Most lenders will do a \"soft\" credit pull before approving you, so checking with multiple lenders shouldn't hurt your score.\n- Do personal loans hurt my credit?\n- Your credit score may drop a bit when you apply for a personal loan. But if you make your payments as agreed, your score should increase when you've paid it off.\n- What if I get denied?\n- If you get denied for a personal loan, you may be able to get the money you need from another lender, with a payday loan, or from friends or family.\nThe SoFi 0.25% autopay interest rate reduction requires you to agree to make monthly principal and interest payments by an automatic monthly deduction from a savings or checking account.

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nWhile you can technically pay off a personal loan early, lenders sometimes charge a prepayment penalty, and there are instances when those funds might be better used.\nThis guide will cover how to pay off a personal loan early, so that you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s a good call and when you should wait.\nHow Paying Off a Loan Early Saves You Money\nPersonal loans typically carry simple interest. That means interest only accrues on the loan\u2019s original principal. So if you pay off a personal loan early or more quickly, you can reduce the amount of what you owe.\nHere\u2019s an example:\n- Loan amount: $10,000 personal loan\n- Interest rate: 10%\n- Original term: 36 months \u2014 total interest paid: $1,616.19\n- If paid off in 18 months: total interest paid will be about $810\n- Interest savings: around $800\n\u201cIf you are in a financial position to pay off a loan early, it\u2019s usually a good idea,\u201d said Kyle Enright, president of lending at Achieve. \u201cYou\u2019ll pay less interest. You\u2019ll have one less monthly payment to make, and hopefully could use that money for savings. Carrying less debt can improve credit profiles and scores in many cases.\u201d\nWhen To Wait: A 4-Point Checklist Before Paying Early\nWhile paying off a loan is often a smart financial move, consider the bigger picture \u2014 it might not be the best use of your funds.\n\u201cMake an honest assessment of your day-to-day finances,\u201d Enright said. \u201cIf paying off the loan early will leave you bereft of savings, without an emergency fund, or struggling to make ends meet, it may not be the best idea or the best timing.\u201d\nConsult this four-point checklist to determine if you should pay a personal loan off early.\n1. Do You Have Enough in Your Emergency Fund?\nExperts generally recommend banking at least three to six months\u2019 worth of expenses in emergency savings. If your rainy day fund is currently lacking \u2014 or, worse yet, nonexistent \u2014 you\u2019re generally better served putting a windfall or extra funding into a high-yield savings account than paying off low-interest debt.\n2. Compare the Interest Rates on All Your Outstanding Balances\nOne of the pros of personal loans is that they typically carry lower annual percentage rates (APRs) compared to other types of financing. The Federal Reserve, for instance, recently reported an average APR on a two-year personal bank loan of 11.57%.\nHowever, borrowers with good credit can often qualify for rates in the single digits. Some of the best personal loans advertise APRs as low as 6.49%.\nBefore you decide to pay off a personal loan early, consider if you have more expensive debts to take care of. This chart below might help you figure out which debts to prioritize paying off.\n| Loan Type | Priority Level | When To Pay It First\u2013or Not |\n|---|---|---|\n| Payday loans | Highest | Always pay first \u2014 APRs can reach 400% and are due two four weeks after loan origination. |\n| Credit cards | High | Pay first if the APRs are higher than other debts. Credit card averages are 21% APR and interst will compound. |\n| High-interest personal loans | High | Pay first if the balance\u2019s APR exceeds the APR on other balances. Personal loans can carry APRs as high as 36%. |\n| Private student loans | Medium | Pay first if the balance\u2019s APR exceeds the APR on other balances. Private student loans rates run as high as 17.95%. |\n| Auto loans | Low | Only pay first ff the balance\u2019s APR exceeds the APR on other balances. The average APR on a new car loan is currently 7.3%. |\n| Federal student loans | Low | Low priority, since the average rate on undergraduate loans is around 5% and there are consumer protections available. |\n| Mortgage | Lowest | Last priority, as the home secures the loan and rates are less than 7%. Plus, there are tax benefits. |\n3. Know Whether You\u2019ll Owe a Prepayment Fee\n\u201cCheck your loan agreement, or directly with your lender, to see if the lender imposes a prepayment penalty,\u201d Enright said. \u201cIf so, calculate the savings in interest in paying off the loan early versus the amount of the penalty.\u201d\nMany personal loans don\u2019t charge prepayment penalties. If they do, the fees are usually between 1% and 5% of your outstanding balance, meaning they\u2019re likely lower than your loan\u2019s interest rate.\nHowever, they\u2019re still important to keep an eye on, especially if you have a high outstanding balance. A 5% prepayment penalty on a $50,000 loan, for instance, is $2,500.\n4. See if There Are Other Investment Opportunities\nIf your loan has a low interest rate, putting any extra funds into a high-yield investment can earn you more.\nThis strategy is tricky, though. Investment returns aren\u2019t guaranteed, and you\u2019ll need an exceptionally low APR on your loan to make the option look good on paper.\nDid You Know?\nThe average annual stock market return rate is around 6% to 7%, according to JPMorgan Wealth Management.\nHow To Pay Off a Personal Loan Early: 3 Steps To Follow\nPaying off a personal loan early isn\u2019t all that different from making a regular payment, but there are a few things to keep in mind to make the most of it. Try these steps below:\n1. Contact Your Lender for a Payoff Quote\nYou can usually do this online through the lender\u2019s app or website. The payoff quote includes the exact amount you\u2019ll need to pay to satisfy the loan, as well as the payment due date.\nRemember \u2014 your payoff quote will usually be higher than the outstanding balance on your monthly statements. That final tally includes interest that accrues between your statement date and payoff date, along with any fees or prepayment penalties.\n2. Choose Your Payoff Strategy and Make the Payment\nYou don\u2019t have to pay off your personal loan in one lump sum. You have several different payment options, such as:\n- Biweekly payments\n- An extra annual payment\n- Higher payments\n- Roundup payments\n3. Get Written Confirmation\nYou\u2019ll usually receive a letter from your lender within 10 days of your final payment. This provides written documentation that you\u2019ve satisfied your debt and the lender has closed the account.\nIf you had your loan set to autopay, cancel those recurring payments. Otherwise, you could incur accidental charges.\nTake Control of Your Loan Payoff\nWhatever strategy you choose, be sure to specify that extra funds are put toward principal, not interest or future monthly payments. That saves you the most money and results in the shortest loan term.\nSome lenders let you automate principal-only payments, while others require notice each time \u2014 and a few don\u2019t allow them at all. It\u2019s best to find out what your lender accepts, so you can make the best approach to pay off a personal loan faster.\nFAQs on Paying Off a Personal Loan Early\nNot sure if paying off a personal loan early is worth it? Take a look at these answers so you can decide.- Does paying off a loan early save interest?\n- Paying off a personal loan early will save you from paying additional interest. Make sure the prepayment penalty isn't higher than what you still owe.\n- Will I owe any penalties or fees?\n- Some lenders charge prepayment penalties when you pay a personal loan off early to make up lost interest. Prepayment penalties typically cost 1% to 5% of the loan's remaining balance.\n- How do I know if it's worth it?\n- To determine if paying a personal loan off early is worth it, you'll have to do some math.\n- First, calculate whether the interest you'll save is more than the prepayment penalty, if there is one.\n- Second, compare the balance you'd pay to satisfy the loan to what you currently owe. This includes interest, fees and any other outstanding loan balances.\n- Finally, consider your financial health. Ask yourself, \"will those funds help me achieve more important goals, like building an emergency fund?\"\n- To determine if paying a personal loan off early is worth it, you'll have to do some math.\n- Can I pay a little extra each month instead of all at once?\n- You can pay a little extra monthly on your personal loan to save on interest and reduce your loan's term. However, you'll need to specify that the extra money should go toward the principal. That way, the lender doesn't put the funds toward interest or hold them for future payments.\n- What happens to my credit if I pay it off early?\n- Paying off a loan early is likely to have a long-term positive impact on your credit score, as it reduces your outstanding debts and demonstrates your ability to repay. However, it may cause a short-term dip in your score, as it lowers the average age of your open accounts and can affect your credit mix.\n- Can you get another loan after paying one off?\n- You can usually apply for a new loan after paying off an existing one, although some lenders may have waiting periods, particularly for recurring customers. Your ability to get a loan depends largely on your credit score, income and overall financial profile.\n- Is it worth getting a personal loan to pay off other debt?\n- Personal loans are often used to consolidate debt, since they tend to have lower APRs than other types of financing, like a credit card. But whether a new personal loan is worth it depends on what other debts you are currently paying off, as well as the interest you could qualify for.\nOur in-house research team and on-site financial experts work together to create content that\u2019s accurate, impartial, and up to date.

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nFears of a recession are growing louder, and many people aren\u2019t waiting for an official announcement to make changes. Rising prices on essentials like rent, food and healthcare are already forcing tough choices, and these workers are finding ways to survive economic uncertainty long before a downturn becomes official.\nAccording to a study from Lance Surety Bonds, people are slashing spending, picking up extra work and moving to cheaper locations to stay ahead of rising costs. Their strategies show what it really takes to recession-proof a household when paychecks can\u2019t keep up with inflation.\nCutting Personal Spending\nMore than half of frontline workers (58%) have cut personal spending to the bone. Eliminating non-essential expenses is a recommended first line of defense when paychecks don\u2019t stretch like they used to.\nPicking Up Side Hustles\nMore than half are bringing in extra income through side gigs. They\u2019re not alone; 41% of U.S. consumers now have supplemental income streams, according to PYMNTS, as people try to close the gap between wages and cost of living.\nDipping Into Savings Early\nA third of those surveyed said they\u2019ve already dipped into savings. When income falls short, savings becomes a lifeline, but one that needs to be rationed carefully. It\u2019s best used to cover essentials like housing, food or utilities, not to maintain non-essentials that no longer fit the budget.\nStopping Saving or Investing\nTwenty-seven percent have paused contributions to savings or investments as prices for essentials climb. With basic expenses climbing and wages remaining flat in many industries, long-term planning often gets pushed aside to manage short-term survival.\nWorking Longer Hours\nA quarter have taken on extra hours, with 21% working 15 or more extra hours each week. That\u2019s the equivalent of nearly 100 full workdays a year, a temporary fix for shrinking purchasing power, but one that risks burnout.\nSelling Personal Belongings\nA quarter of people surveyed reported they have sold off tools, electronics or vehicles to make ends meet. With figures from the New York Fed showing that U.S. household debt is now at $18.2 trillion, selling unused assets can be a smarter move than borrowing at high interest.\nTaking on Personal Debt\nIncurring personal debt to manage rising costs has jumped as well. If borrowing is unavoidable, focusing on the lowest-interest options available and creating a strict repayment plan before taking on new debt can help limit long-term damage.\nMoving to Cheaper Housing\nWhile it may be a stretch for some, 9% of the workers surveyed have relocated to less expensive areas. Redfin reports that median U.S. asking rent dropped 1% year over year to $1,633 in May 2025, and sometimes moving even a short distance can save hundreds each month, savings that go straight toward rent, bills or debt.\nMore From GOBankingRates"

The cold sweat beads on your forehead and a shiver races down your spine. No, you\u2019re not watching a classic horror flick \u2014 you\u2019re reviewing your finances for the month. There\u2019s no blaming the Wolfman or Freddy Krueger for your dread. The scary truth is, you can\u2019t pay your bills. You imagine your life spiraling into doom, and it feels like there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\nOkay, time to take a deep breath. Relax. You\u2019re not the first person this has happened to. Experts like financial educator Prince Dykes, founder of the Royal Financial Investment Group and the Global Children Financial Literacy Foundation, and host of \u201cThe Investor Show,\u201d have helped many people navigate this exact situation.\nHe wants you to know: You\u2019re not doomed. There are steps you can take to triage the immediate crisis while also setting yourself up for a better financial future.\nTime To Plan, Not To Panic\nYes, ending up in this position may mean you\u2019re living beyond your current means. But sometimes, life simply happens. A job loss, surprise medical expense, or emergency car repair can throw even a well-balanced budget into chaos. Dykes says now\u2019s not the time for guilt \u2014 it\u2019s time for action.\n\u201cDon\u2019t panic or make rushed decisions,\u201d he says. Instead, take a deep breath and start with a full accounting of your financial picture. List every bill you owe, including due dates, amounts, and how essential each one is to your livelihood \u2014 and compare that to how much cash you have on hand.\n\u201cCalculate the precise shortfall. This gives you a clear picture of what you\u2019re working with instead of operating on fear or assumptions,\u201d Dykes explains. \u201cKnowledge is power in financial crises. Cut any unnecessary bills and consider downsizing them. Work out a payment plan for the bills you are behind on.\u201d\nPart of working out a payment plan may involve picking up the phone and calling your creditors. Many will work with you, especially if you reach out before a payment is late. When you call, ask about extended due dates, revised payment plans, or even temporary hardship programs. You may be surprised by how much flexibility they offer.\nPrioritizing Can Be a Key to Success\nWhen deciding which bills you absolutely must pay first and which ones you can delay or negotiate, Dykes says to focus first and foremost on what keeps you housed, fed and employed. That means rent or mortgage, utilities, food, transportation, medications, and, if applicable, internet access for work.\nOf course, you won\u2019t love taking the hit on your credit score, but you can remedy that later. In a true cash-flow emergency, your credit score should not come before your basic human needs.\nThat said, credit card companies are often willing to negotiate. Call your provider and ask about hardship programs. Likewise, you may find that student loan providers are willing to offer deferment or forbearance, especially if you\u2019ve previously had a good payment history.\nWhile nobody relishes the idea of being in medical debt, Dykes adds that, since medical bills are rarely reported to credit bureaus immediately, you could let that one slip for a month to give yourself some breathing room.\nAs for gym memberships, streaming services, and other subscriptions? Cancel or pause them now. \u201cIf you\u2019re not using them, it\u2019s probably time to cut \u2019em,\u201d Dykes says.\nEven your cable and internet might fall into this category, unless you need it for work or school, in which case, you\u2019ve got to prioritize it.\nAvoiding Long-Term Damage\nThe best way to avoid falling behind on your bills is to get ahead of the problem. Track your expenses closely so you can spot trouble before it snowballs.\n\u201cContact creditors before missing a payment \u2014 they\u2019re more willing to work with proactive customers,\u201d Dykes says. And whatever arrangements you agree to, get them in writing.\nAbove all, don\u2019t dig the hole even deeper by taking on high-interest \u201cquick fixes\u201d like payday loans. These may seem like a solution, but they typically only worsen your situation.\nInstead, look into local resources, like utility assistance programs, food banks or nonprofit credit counselors who can help you make a longer-term plan that will get you back on solid financial ground.\nKeep Your Spirits Up\nThese resources exist for good reason \u2014 you\u2019re hardly the first person to need help, and you won\u2019t be the last. Dykes reminds readers that financial setbacks are common \u2014 and usually temporary.\n\u201cThe key is being proactive rather than reactive, and treating this as a problem to solve rather than a personal failure,\u201d he said.\nReach out to trusted friends or family members if you need emotional support. Chances are, they\u2019ve been through tough times too.\nBottom Line\nEveryone hits financial rough patches. But staying calm, prioritizing wisely and reaching out for help can make all the difference in getting back on your feet \u2014 stronger and more confident than before.\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

Gen Z certainly embraces this ethos, leaning into the fashion trends of their Millennial forerunners (hello, low-rise jeans). Studies from outlets like Adolescent Content, a youth-focused creative agency, show that Zoomers are also emotionally invested in achieving traditional financial milestones that would have made their grandparents proud, like owning a home, building a family and even moving to the suburbs.\nSo, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that Gen Z is embracing the old-fashioned value of frugality \u2014 only, of course, with their own digital twist. It certainly doesn\u2019t surprise Brian Jung, a leading voice in personal finance and cryptocurrency, who boasts more than 2.2 million subscribers on his YouTube channel. Jung has noticed that Zoomers aren\u2019t just passionate about living frugally \u2014 they\u2019re actively redefining what a cost-conscious life can look like.\nInstead of seeing frugality as \u201cgoing without,\u201d Zoomers are finding style \u2014 and even joy \u2014 in minimalism.\nHow Gen Z Compares to Other Generations\nAs Jung explains it, past generations often took a more reactionary stance toward frugality, treating it as a way to delay gratification when they couldn\u2019t afford something they wanted or to cut back after they\u2019d already overspent. But rather than gaze at a pricey item with heart eyes and a sense of impending financial doom, Zoomers are swapping out champagne tastes for a nice sparkling water instead (or, better yet, cold tap water).\n\u201cGen Z is bypassing that cycle altogether by making intentional purchases from the start,\u201d Jung said. \u201cMinimalism isn\u2019t just a design trend \u2014 it\u2019s a filter for life. It\u2019s about removing distractions and aligning spending with values.\u201d\nThese values might reflect broader social and political concerns, like ethical consumption and environmentally friendly purchases. But they also speak to the kind of life Gen Z wants \u2014 one that might include staying in to save for a down payment on a home in lieu of \u201chitting the club\u201d (as their older, less-cool parents might have done at their age) and staying stuck in the rental cycle.\nWhy Frugality Is the New Flex\nIt\u2019s no secret that Gen Z has come of age during a time of rising debt, high housing costs and increased economic pressure. But instead of responding to the financial crunch by pleasure-seeking with their wallets, Jung says they\u2019re taking a more values-based, future-focused approach to spending and saving.\n\u201cGen Z doesn\u2019t just want to make money; they want financial peace,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d rather own less and live more. Minimalism is a rebellion against excess, and frugality is the new flex.\u201d\nFor older generations, the less (money you spend) is more (economic freedom) approach Gen Z is embracing offers a compelling template. As Gen X works toward a stable retirement and Millennials balance the needs of aging parents and their own kids, intentional spending that focuses on what truly \u201csparks joy\u201d (to quote Marie Kondo, one of the OG queens of minimalism) could help build a more secure financial future.\nRebranding Frugality\nLike everything else they touch, Zoomers are adding their own unique touch to the reemergence of minimalism and frugality. The way Jung sees it, Gen Z is doing more than redefining minimalism \u2014 they\u2019re rebranding it entirely.\n\u201cMinimalism isn\u2019t sacrifice \u2014 it\u2019s strategy, and we\u2019re seeing a new culture being developed,\u201d he said. \u201cGen Z is focused on spending in alignment with their values, which often means choosing quality over quantity, digital tools over clutter, and flexibility over accumulation.\u201d\nUnlike their predecessors, who remember the days of dial-up internet \u2014 or using the phone book (gasp) \u2014 Gen Z has been tech-savvy from day one. They\u2019ve integrated the speed and convenience of online life into their approach to thriftiness, making frugality a team effort.\n\u201cFrom tracking subscriptions to group-sharing expenses, Gen Z is tech-savvy in a way that makes frugality look effortless,\u201d said Jung. \u201cThey use budgeting apps, browser tools for cash back, and even learn money hacks through social media. They\u2019re proving that discipline can be digital and communal.\u201d\nBottom Line\nYes, everything old is new again, including the increasing popularity of embracing a frugal lifestyle \u2014 and Zoomers are leading the way. They\u2019re finding smart, stylish ways to make being thrifty easy and cool, and the rest of us could stand to take notes.\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

      "text": "What Is a Personal Loan?\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nA personal loan is money you borrow from a bank, credit union, or online lender, usually paid back in monthly installments. Most personal loans are unsecured, meaning you don\u2019t need any collateral like a savings account or property to secure the funds you borrow.\nHow Do Personal Loans Work? A Simple Guide\nPersonal loans typically have a fixed repayment schedule, often two to seven years, though some shorter and longer terms are available as well.\nPaying Interest\nWhen you take out a personal loan, you\u2019ll pay interest as part of your monthly payment installment. The lender will decide upon your interest rate when reviewing your loan application, which will include financial details like your income and credit score. Most personal loan interest rates are fixed, meaning they stay the same over the entire loan term.\nRegular Payments\nOnce you take out a personal loan, you\u2019ll repay the lender over time in regular monthly payments. For instance, if you borrowed $5,000 with a term of 24 months, your monthly payment would be about $208, before factoring in your interest.\nWhat Is Needed for a Personal Loan?\nIf you\u2019re wondering how to get a personal loan, you should first familiarize yourself with the application requirements. You\u2019ll need to gather the following to prepare your application:\n- Proof of identity, such as a government-issued ID\n- Proof of income and employment, which can include pay stubs or tax returns\n- Proof of address, such as utility bills\n- Credit score \u2014 you\u2019ll submit to a hard credit inquiry when you apply for a personal loan. You should know your credit score before you apply, and check if the lender has a minimum credit score.\nWhat Are Personal Loans Used For?\nMost personal loans can technically be used for anything. Here are some examples:\n- Debt consolidation\n- Emergency expenses like medical bills, home renovation\n- Milestone events like a wedding\nYou can even use a personal loan for business purposes, which can be a good option if you can\u2019t qualify for a business loan because you\u2019re just starting out and don\u2019t have much to show in the way of a business credit score or revenue.\nWhile most personal loans are multipurpose, meaning you won\u2019t specifically apply for a wedding loan or a debt consolidation loan, a lender may ask you how you\u2019re planning to use the loan as part of the application process.\nHow To Get a Personal Loan\nTo get a personal loan, follow these steps.\n- Check your credit score: Knowing your credit score ahead of time will help you know if you meet lenders\u2019 requirements.\n- Compare lenders and rates: Lenders offer a variety of rates and terms, so it\u2019s essential to compare multiple options to secure the best deal.\n- Prequalify if possible: Some lenders allow you to prequalify by sharing some basic financial info, which can give you an idea of how much money you can borrow without undergoing a hard credit pull, which can cause a dip in your credit score in the short term.\n- Gather needed documents: As mentioned above, you\u2019ll need to provide proof of identity, income and more.\n- Submit your application: You can either apply online or in person, depending on whether you go through a bank, credit union or online-only lender.\n- Get approved and receive funds: Some lenders offer same-day approval, while others take a few business days to approve your application and deliver your funds.\nTypes of Personal Loans\nThere are many types of personal loans, reflecting the fact that you can use them in a variety of ways. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the most common varieties.\nUnsecured Personal Loans\nMost personal loans are unsecured, meaning they don\u2019t require collateral to \u201csecure\u201d the money you\u2019re borrowing. However, you\u2019ll generally have to meet a lender\u2019s minimum credit score requirements to get an unsecured loan, so if you don\u2019t have a good credit score and can\u2019t apply with a cosigner this may not be an option.\nSecured Personal Loans\nConversely, secured personal loans are backed by collateral, such as your car or funds in a savings account. If you don\u2019t have a good credit score, getting a secured personal loan could be easier than finding an unsecured option.\nDebt Consolidation Loans\nPersonal loans used for debt consolidation combine multiple debts, such as balances from multiple high-interest credit cards. The benefits of a debt consolidation loan include that you\u2019re streamlining your debt repayment into one monthly sum rather than several payments, and you could be able to get a lower interest rate.\nFixed-Rate vs. Variable-Rate Loans\nMost personal loans have a fixed interest rate, meaning the interest you pay won\u2019t change over time. This is helpful because you\u2019ll know exactly how much you\u2019ll pay every month, with no surprises.\nWhile variable-rate personal loans are less common, you may come across this option. The downside is that your payment amount may change over time, and you have less predictability.\nCosigned or Joint Loans\nSome lenders allow you to apply with a co-signer, which can improve your chances of approval, especially if your credit score isn\u2019t high enough. A co-signer should be someone you know well and trust, both because you want them to have a good credit profile to help your approval odds and because they are taking on a risk by co-signing your application. If you aren\u2019t able to repay the loan, the co-signer will be on the hook to make payments.\nJoint loans are another option, but whereas co-signers don\u2019t get any of the loan funds, a joint applicant does. So you\u2019re essentially applying for the loans and sharing the money.\nTypical Personal Loan Terms\nPersonal loans can be for as little as a few hundred dollars or as much as $100,000, but most commonly they\u2019re for amounts ranging between $1,000 and $50,000.\nPersonal loan terms vary as well, with bigger loans generally having the longest payback terms. Your loan term could be anywhere from 12 to 84 months, depending on your specific situation .\nHow Does Interest Work on a Personal Loan?\nThe interest you\u2019ll pay on a personal loan depends on your credit score, as lenders view your credit as a representation of how likely you are to pay the loan back on time without any issues.\nIf you have a higher credit score, you\u2019re considered less of a credit risk and will generally qualify for a lower interest rate, while lower credit scores represent more of a borrowing risk to lenders and therefore qualify for higher interest rates. Personal loan interest rates can range anywhere from 6% to 36% based on your creditworthiness.\nLoan Fees\nBeyond interest costs, many loans come with a variety of fees, including an origination fee when you first get the loan, late payment fees, and prepayment penalties. Not all lenders have these fees \u2014 make sure you review the loan agreement before signing so you know exactly what you\u2019re getting into.\nHere are some sample loan amounts with different term lengths and interest rates. You can see how this breaks down into different monthly payment amounts and how much you\u2019ll pay in total to borrow money.\n| Loan Amount | Term Length | Interest Rate or APR | Estimated Monthly Payment | Total Repayment |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $5,000 | 2 years/24 months | 10% | $230 | $5,520 |\n| $10,000 | 3 years/36 months | 12% | $332 | $11,952 |\n| $15,000 | 5 years/60 months | 14% | $349 | $20,940 |\n| $20,000 | 7 years/84 months | 16% | $350 | $29,400 |\nAre Personal Loans Bad? Pros and Cons\nTo be fully informed, make sure you know the pros and cons of a personal loan before you get one. Personal loans aren\u2019t 100% good or bad, but they have distinct advantages and disadvantages that determine who they are best for.\nThe pros of personal loans include:\n- Fast access to cash\n- Fixed payments\n- No collateral needed (in most cases)\nThe cons of personal loans include:\n- High interest rates if you have bad credit\n- Risk of debt if not used carefully\n- May impact credit score if not repaid on time\nThe biggest thing to keep in mind when borrowing money through a personal loan is that you should only borrow what you can afford to repay. Find a repayment term that works for you and ensure that monthly payment fits into your budget.\nIs a Personal Loan Right for You?\nA personal loan might be a good fit for you if any of the following apply:\nA personal loan might be a good fit if:\n- You need a lump sum of money quickly\n- You have a solid plan to repay it on time\n- You qualify for a lower interest rate than a credit card\n- You\u2019re consolidating high-interest debt into one payment\nConversely, a personal loan may not be right for you if:\n- You\u2019re unsure you can keep up with monthly payments\n- You have unstable income or poor credit\n- You\u2019re tempted to borrow more than you need\n- Other options like 0% APR credit cards or payment plans are available, and would cost less\nWhat To Know About Personal Loans Before You Apply\nBefore you decide upon a personal loan, you should check your credit score to know if you\u2019ll meet lenders\u2019 requirements. Shop around with various lenders to get the best rates and terms, and make sure you understand all fees and the total amount of money you\u2019re paying to borrow the funds.\nAnd above all else, always only borrow the amount of money you need \u2014 it\u2019s not worth the interest cost and potential for sustained debt to borrow more than you truly need or can afford.\nFAQs About Personal Loans\nA personal loan can help cover life's expenses\u2014here are answers to common questions.- What\u2019s the difference between a personal loan and a credit card?\n- A personal loan is an installment loan, where you get the borrowed money up front and pay it off in regular monthly installments. A credit card is a revolving line of credit, where you can spend up to your credit limit and need to pay it back on a monthly basis.\n- How fast can I get a personal loan?\n- Some lenders offer personal loans as fast as the same or next day, while others take a few days to approve your application and deliver funds.\n- Can I get a personal loan with bad credit?\n- It could be possible to get a personal loan with bad credit, though you will pay a higher interest and you may need to apply with a cosigner if you don't meet the lender's minimum credit score requirements.\n- Will a personal loan hurt my credit score?\n- A personal loan can hurt your credit score slightly in the short term because the lender will do a hard credit check. But if you repay the loan on time each month, your positive payment history can improve your credit score in the long run.\n- What happens if I miss a payment?\n- Missing a personal loan payment can hurt your credit score, and the lender may charge a late fee and additional interest.\nOur in-house research team and on-site financial experts work together to create content that\u2019s accurate, impartial, and up to date.

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 YearsHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed by Experts\nTrusted by Millions of Readers\nFor all the ways people love saving money at Costco, there are still some products that just don\u2019t make its customers happy.\nIn fact, these products garner entire Reddit threads of discontent. Not all of these complaints have to do with the product itself, but packaging, prices or even mold. Here are six products that have the most customer complaints.\nKirkland Signature Milk\nMilk is milk, no matter how you package it, but Costco\u2019s Kirkland Signature brand milk gallons get a unique complaint, according to Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything wrong with the milk itself, but rather shoppers that are forced to buy the square-shaped containers absolutely despise them.\u201d\nRamhold said the shape is reportedly to make the milk easier to ship as well as cheaper and environmentally friendly, but shoppers who have had to use them talk about how it makes them prone to spilling milk whenever you pour.\n\u201cPersonally, I can vouch for this one. I can\u2019t think of a single time I\u2019ve used those jugs and not spilled at least a little milk when pouring.\u201d\nCostco appears to have heard the complaints on this one and plans to try to correct this problem, according to Eat This, Not That.\nKirkland Signature Chicken Bakes\nCostco fans have spoken and they\u2019re unanimous. It\u2019s much better to buy an in-club made chicken bake and skip the frozen ready-made option.\nSeveral fans took to Reddit to complain that the frozen chicken bakes were among one of the worst Kirkland Signature items sold at the warehouse club. Apparently, the frozen version just isn\u2019t the same as the real thing.\nChomps Beef Sticks\nChomps Beef Sticks are grass-fed beef sticks that are meant to be a healthier, high protein snack. While not a Costco-specific brand, Ramhold said, \u201cThe Costco subreddit has several users commenting on finding at least one stick in their package that seemed green from possible mold and therefore has to be tossed in the bin.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cYour mileage may vary on this product, though, and since the sticks are individually wrapped, you don\u2019t have to worry about one contaminating the rest of the batch.

  "argos_summary": "Personal loans can be a smart alternative to credit cards, offering lower rates and a chance to build credit, but borrowers must understand that rates are driven by economic conditions, lender risk tolerance, and especially credit score. Shorter-term loans usually have lower rates, while fixed-rate loans provide predictability; variable rates can rise with market changes. Fees such as origination, prepayment penalties, and hidden costs can significantly increase the true cost, so shoppers should use soft credit pulls, compare APRs, and read fine print before applying. Credit unions often offer lower rates and fees than banks, and online lenders can provide quick approvals, but each option has its own eligibility and fee structure. Ultimately, the best personal loan is one with the lowest total cost, suitable terms, and a lender that matches the borrower\u2019s credit profile and financial goals.",
