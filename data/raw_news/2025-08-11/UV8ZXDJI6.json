  "title": "Surrey University to review NHS ethnicity pay gaps",
  "description": "The review will explore differences in pay, career progression, and pension contributions.",
  "content": "The University of Surrey has begun a major review into ethnicity pay gaps across the NHS in England. The review has been commissioned by the NHS Race and Health Observatory, an independent body established by the health service. The 18-month long project will run until December 2026 and will explore differences in pay, career progression, pension contributions and overall earning potential of staff from different ethnic backgrounds. NHS Employers, which represents NHS England, said it \"welcomed the much-needed review\" and described it as \"crucial work\".\n\nAnnouncing the review, the university said it would be drawing on \"extensive expertise in workplace equity and pay structures\". Professor of human resource management at the university, Carol Woodhams, is co-leading the review with colleagues Dr Nicola Burton-Brown and Prof Giuseppe Moscelli, in partnership with leadership and inclusion consultancy Delta. Prof Woodhams said the team was \"proud to be leading this important work\". \"We've researched workplace pay gaps for many years, so we're pleased to support this vital review. \"It's a chance to uncover the root causes of ethnic disparities in NHS pay and progression, and to help drive meaningful, evidence-based change,\" she added.\n\nOwen Chinembiri, assistant director of workforce at the observatory, said: \"Black, Asian and ethnic minority staff continue to face hurdles when it comes to career progression in the NHS. \"Even though there have been some improvements over the past few years, this has been slow, patchy and frustrating for ethnic minority staff who have been impacted for far too long.\" He described tackling inequalities as \"an urgent matter\" and said research would\" identify areas with unwarranted gaps\" and \"come up with impactful recommendations\".\n\nHelga Pile from trade union UNISON, which represents many NHS employees, said: \"Almost one in three NHS staff in England are from black or ethnic minority backgrounds, but... there's clear evidence they're less likely than white colleagues to secure jobs with higher salaries, even after being shortlisted. \"Understanding all the root causes is essential to wiping out disadvantage.\" Its chief executive, Danny Mortimer, said it welcomed the review. He added: \"The delivery of a better NHS and a healthier nation requires the best use of all the talents in our workforce. \"We cannot jeopardise this by the presence of inequalities and racism in our workplaces.\" He said said ethnic pay gap reporting was not mandatory, although some trusts voluntarily reported on earnings. The final report, which is due in December 2026, will \"offer clear, actionable recommendations\", he added.",

      "text": "Gender pay gap of \u00a36 per hour at hospitals\n- Published\nThere is a \"significant pay gap\" between men and women working in a county's hospitals, a new report says.\nAccording to the Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust report men are paid - on average - \u00a36 more per hour, although this is largely due to differences between male and female medical staff rather than all wages.\nHealth chiefs said excellence in care awards, from which male medical staff have predominantly benefited from, and 64% of bonus payments being made to male medical and dental staff are the main reason.\nThe trust said it will be concentrating on ensuring fair career opportunities, supporting senior female staff, and reviewing pay structures.\nThere is no significant gender pay gap among non-medical staff and they represent around 81.6% of the trust's workforce, according to the report, the Local Democracy Reporting Service reports.\nFor non-medical staff, the mean pay gap is 0.62% in favour of men, while the median pay gap is -5.3%, indicating that pay equity exists for most staff, the report states.\nBut 399 bonus payments were made to medical and dental staff - 64% awarded to men and 36% to women.\nMale consultants earned an average bonus of \u00a38,802.24, compared to \u00a35,644.48 for women \u2013 a 35.90% pay gap.\nThe report, presented to a board meeting, says 22% of its workers are male while 78% are female. But, while there is an average \u00a36 an hour pay gap, this drops significantly when excluding medical and dental staff.\nWhen those staff along with their Local Clinical Excellence Awards (LCEA), are excluded from the analysis, the gender pay gap disappears.\n\"The significant pay gap seen overall is primarily influenced by the medical workforce,\" the report reads.\n\"The Trust's annual LCEA scheme, which rewarded consultants for outstanding care, ended in 2020.\n\"Funds were then equally shared among all substantive consultants, regardless of hours worked.\"\nGet in touch\nTell us which stories we should cover in Gloucestershire\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

That compares to the \u00a337,470 average pay for men - a gap of more than 23%.\nThe total excludes bonuses and overtime that are paid on top of basic pay.\nLast month the BBC revealed 6.5 times as many male consultants as female received the top platinum bonus worth \u00a377,000 a year.\nThe data, compiled by NHS Digital for the government using mean rather than median averages, also provided a breakdown for doctors of all grades.\nIt found a gender pay gap of 15% with male doctors paid \u00a367,788 in basic pay, compared to the \u00a357,569 female doctors receive.\nWant to find out the median gender pay gap at your company? Try the calculator below.\nIf you can't see the calculator, click here.\nDr Sally Davies, of the Medical Woman's Federation, said the findings were disappointing, but not surprising.\n\"It reflects the fact that men are more likely to make it into senior positions. It is the same issue we have seen in the rest of the economy.\n\"I think it raises serious questions for the NHS and government. I would like to know what they are going to do about it.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We are committed to ensuring that our hardworking NHS staff are rewarded fairly and equally for their work regardless of gender.\n\"The department is working closely with NHS organisations to support them in closing their gender pay gaps and has committed to an independent review of the gender pay gap in medicine.\"\n- Published15 September 2017\n- Published10 May 2016\n- Published15 October 2015\n- Published10 September 2015\n- Published11 March 2014\n- Published14 January 2016"
