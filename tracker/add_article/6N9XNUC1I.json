      "summary": "President Trump announced that India has offered to cut its 50% tariffs on U.S. goods to zero, a claim that has yet to be confirmed by Indian officials. The announcement comes amid a week of U.S. market volatility, with equity futures and Treasuries falling ahead of key jobs data. Analysts note that the U.S. economy may be more resilient than consensus, potentially dampening expectations for Fed rate cuts, while investors are reassessing the timing of a market “reckoning.”",
