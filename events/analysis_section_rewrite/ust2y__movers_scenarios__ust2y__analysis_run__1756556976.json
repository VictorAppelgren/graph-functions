      "feedback": "Your draft meets the 4‑line format but lacks several critical elements for a world‑class macro view: 1) **Magnitude ranges** – each driver must specify the expected UST 10Y move (e.g., “10‑20 bp fall” or “10‑20 bp rise”) so the sign and size are explicit; 2) **Canonical driver naming** – replace “Fed rate cut/hike” with the canonical handle `fed_policy` (or `fed_rate_cut`/`fed_rate_hike` if you prefer a sub‑driver) to satisfy the handle‑mapping rule; 3) **Probability alignment** – use the source‑derived probabilities: 89 % for a September cut (7XH2DKEKV), ~70 % for inflation easing (core CPI drop) if you can justify it with the core CPI release, ~10 % for a Fed hike (based on the 86 % probability of a cut overall), and ~15 % for a debt surge (if you can cite a fiscal‑deficit projection); 4) **Citations for every claim** – attach the relevant ID after each magnitude, probability, and catalyst (e.g., “10‑20 bp fall (7XH2DKEKV)”) so the chain is fully traceable; 5) **Single‑sentence, no filler** – keep each line tight: “Up | 1‑3 mo | fed_policy (cut) → ust10y 10‑20 bp fall | Fed policy meeting 16‑17 Sept 2025 (7XH2DKEKV) | 89 %”; 6) **Avoid duplicate drivers** – the two “Up” lines should be distinct (one for policy, one for inflation) and not both tied to the same catalyst unless you explicitly differentiate the trigger dates; 7) **Include a catalyst window** – for the debt surge line, specify a fiscal‑deficit announcement or Treasury issuance schedule as the watch point; 8) **Ensure the “What to watch” is a concrete event** – e.g., “core CPI release 1 Oct 2025” or “Treasury issuance calendar Q4 2025” rather than a vague “Treasury yield changes”. Apply these edits and your output will satisfy the handle‑mapping, catalyst, magnitude, and probability requirements for a defensible macro view.",
