      "text": "Trump expands L.A. military tactics by sending National Guard to Washington, D.C.\n- Share via\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In an expansion of tactics started in June during immigration raids in Los Angeles, President Trump on Monday announced he would take federal control of Washington\u2019s police department and activate 800 National Guard troops in the nation\u2019s capital to help \u201creestablish law and order.\u201d\n\u201cOur capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people,\u201d Trump said at the White House.\n\u201cThis is liberation day in D.C.,\u201d he declared.\nTrump, who sent roughly 5,000 Marines and National Guard troops to L.A. in June in a move that was opposed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, issued an executive order declaring a public safety emergency in D.C. The order invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act that places the Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control.\nThe California governor decried Trump\u2019s move in D.C., warning that what happened in L.A. was now taking place across the country.\n\u201cHe was just getting warmed up in Los Angeles,\u201d Newsom said on X. \u201cHe will gaslight his way into militarizing any city he wants in America. This is what dictators do.\u201d\nCalifornia arrests lag behind states such as Texas and Florida, because those states started with more arrests. They also have a stronger record of cooperation.\nIn his briefing, Trump painted D.C. in dark, apocalyptic terms as a grimy hellhole \u201cof crime, bloodshed, bedlam, squalor and worse.\u201d He said he planned to get tough, citing his administration\u2019s stringent enforcement on the nation\u2019s southern border.\nAlready, Trump said, his administration has begun to remove homeless people from encampments across the city, and he said he planned to target undocumented immigrants, too. He vowed to \u201crestore the city back to the gleaming capital that everybody wants it to be.\u201d\nAs the White House noted in a fact sheet Monday, D.C. had a 2024 homicide rate of 27 per 100,000 residents, the nation\u2019s fourth-highest homicide rate. By comparison, Los Angeles\u2019 homicide rate is 7.1 per 100,000 residents.\nBut data also show violent crime has declined significantly in D.C. in recent years.\nJust a few weeks before Trump took office, the Justice Department announced that violent crime in the city was at a 30-year low. Homicides were down 32%, robberies down 39% and armed carjackings down 53% when compared with 2023 levels, according to data collected by the Metropolitan Police Department.\nIn a press conference Monday, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called Trump\u2019s deployment of troops \u201cunsettling and unprecedented.\u201d But she also tried to strike a conciliatory tone with the president, acknowledging he was operating within the letter of the law in her district.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a state. We don\u2019t control the D.C. National Guard,\u201d she told reporters. \u201c... Limited home rule gives the federal government the ability to intrude on our autonomy in many ways.\u201d\nBowser suggested the president was misinformed about crime in the district, advancing the idea that his views of D.C. were largely shaped by his COVID-era experience.\n\u201cIt is true that those were more challenging times,\u201d Bowser told reporters. \u201cIt is also true that we experienced a crime spike post-COVID. But we worked quickly to put laws in place and tactics that got violent offenders off our streets and gave our police officers more tools, which is why we have seen a huge decrease in crime.\u201d\nAccountability for gun-related crimes in the district remains an issue of concern, Bowser said, again offering an olive branch to Trump. But she noted that crime in the capital is down to pre-pandemic levels and that violent crime statistics are at 30-year lows.\nBrian Schwalb, the elected attorney general of the District of Columbia, said in a statement that \u201cthere is no crime emergency\u201d in D.C. and the administration\u2019s deployment of troops was \u201cunprecedented, unnecessary and unlawful.\u201d\nHis office refuted the claims of Jeanine Pirro, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, who said juveniles, or as she put it, \u201cyoung punks,\u201d were too often granted probation or other lenient sentences\nIn D.C., the U.S. attorney\u2019s office handles all adult felonies and the majority of adult misdemeanors, while Schwalb\u2019s office exercises jurisdiction over crimes committed by juveniles and some adult misdemeanors.\nSince Schwalb took office in January 2023, the office has prosecuted so many juveniles at higher rates that the mayor has had to issue an emergency order creating more space at juvenile detention facilities, according to his office. Last year, the office prosecuted over 90% of homicide and attempted homicide cases, 88% of violent assault cases and 87% of carjacking cases, according to the statement.\nKen Lang, a veteran of the Baltimore Police Department and an expert on law enforcement, said that Trump\u2019s actions in D.C. could be an effort \u201cto model a new national law enforcement strategy by having federal, state and local agencies better partner together.\u201d\nBut because it is a federal district and not a state, he said, D.C. occupies a \u201cunique legal position\u201d under the Home Rule Act.\nOklahoma Mayor David Holt, who is also president of the United States Conference of Mayors, condemned Trump\u2019s move as a \u201ctakeover,\u201d and said \u201clocal control is always best.\u201d\nHolt noted that the Trump administration\u2019s data \u2014 specifically, the FBI\u2019s national crime rate report released last week \u2014 shows crime rates dropping in cities across the nation.\nTrump said the deployment of troops in D.C. should serve as a warning to cities across the nation \u2014 including Los Angeles.\n\u201cHopefully L.A.\u2019s watching,\u201d Trump said as he berated Bass and Newsom for their handling of the firestorm that swept through the region in January, destroying thousands of homes.\n\u201cThe mayor\u2019s incompetent and so is Gov. Newscum,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a good line of bull\u2014, but that\u2019s about it.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s announcement that he was deploying troops to D.C. comes more than two months after he sparked a major legal battle with California when he sent thousands of troops to Los Angeles. He argued they were necessary to combat what he described as \u201cviolent, insurrectionist mobs\u201d as protests broke out in the city against federal immigration raids.\nBut the protests calmed relatively quickly and local officials said they were primarily kept in check by police. The National Guard troops and Marines wound up sparsely deployed in Los Angeles, with some protecting federal buildings and some assisting federal agents as they conducted immigration enforcement operations. Military officials said the troops were restricted to security and crowd control and had no law enforcement authority.\nThe number of arrests of undocumented immigration in the Los Angeles area appears to have dropped significantly since June.\nTrump\u2019s deployment of troops to D.C. immediately found its way into the pitched court battle in California over whether his administration violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars federalized military from civilian law enforcement.\nAs top U.S. military officials testified before Senior U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer in federal court in San Francisco on Monday, California lawyers quickly maneuvered to get Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s statement into evidence, hoping to bolster their argument that the government had not only knowingly violated the law, but was likely to do so again.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the tests for injunctive relief, right?\u201d Breyer said. \u201cPresent conduct may be relevant on that issue.\u201d\nIn June, Breyer ruled that Trump broke the law when he mobilized thousands of California National Guard members against the state\u2019s wishes.\nIn a 36-page decision, Breyer wrote that Trump\u2019s actions \u201cwere illegal \u2014 both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the 10th Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d\nBut the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals paused that court order, allowing the troops to remain in Los Angeles while the case plays out in federal court. The appellate court found the president had broad, though not \u201cunreviewable,\u201d authority to deploy the military in American cities.\nThat decision is set to be reviewed by a larger \u201cen banc\u201d panel of the appellate court. Meanwhile, California continues to fight what it says are illegal uses of the military for civilian law enforcement in Judge Breyer\u2019s court in San Francisco."

      "text": "Video shows steel workers scrambling into wreckage left by explosion that killed 2 in Pennsylvania\n- Share via\nCLAIRTON, Pa. \u2014 After an explosion rocked a steel plant outside Pittsburgh, workers scrambled into the wreckage alongside firefighters. A cloud of black smoke rose above a charred pickup truck as rescuers sprayed the scene with streams of water.\nBy the time the scene was secure, two people were dead and more than 10 others were injured, including one who spent hours trapped in rubble left Monday by the blast that was powerful enough to shake nearby homes.\nVideo from Pittsburgh television station WTAE showed workers in orange jumpsuits and hard hats running toward the wreckage at the U.S. Steel coking plant in Clairton. A reporter described seeing someone being pulled from the debris and loaded onto a gurney. The station\u2019s footage later showed a mountain of charred rubble spilling from a hole left by demolished walls.\nInvestigators worked Tuesday to determine the cause of the blast, which jolted a region of the state synonymous with steel for more than a century. Amy Sowers, who was sitting on her porch less than a mile from the plant, felt her house shake.\n\u201cI could see smoke from my driveway,\u201d she said. \u201cWe heard ambulances and fire trucks from every direction.\u201d\nSowers, 45, grew up in Clairton and has seen several fatal accidents at the plant over the years.\n\u201cLives were lost again,\u201d Sowers said. \u201cHow many more lives are going to have to be lost until something happens?\u201d\nInvestigating the blast\u2019s cause\nCompany officials were expected to join Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro at a news conference scheduled for Tuesday afternoon.\nSpeaking to reporters Monday, U.S. Steel\u2019s chief manufacturing officer, Scott Buckiso, gave no details about the damage or casualties. He said the company, now a subsidiary of Japan-based Nippon Steel Corp., was working with authorities.\nThe Allegheny County Police Department said five people were hospitalized in critical but stable condition Monday night, and five others had been treated and released. Other individuals were treated for injuries at the scene, but the department said it did not have an exact number.\nThe county medical examiner\u2019s office identified one of the dead as Timothy Quinn, 39.\nAccording to the company, the plant has approximately 1,400 workers.\nIn a statement, the United Steelworkers union, which represents many of the Clairton plant\u2019s workers, said it had representatives on the ground at the plant and would work to ensure there is a thorough investigation.\nDavid Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment, an environmental group that has sued U.S. Steel over pollution, called for an independent investigation and a reevaluation \u201cas to whether the Clairton plant is fit to keep operating.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the first explosion at the plant. A maintenance worker was killed in a blast in September 2009. In July 2010, another explosion injured 14 employees and six contractors. According to online federal records of workplace fatalities, the last death at the plant was in 2014, when a worker was burned and died after falling into a trench.\nAfter the 2010 explosion, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined U.S. Steel and a subcontractor $175,000 for safety violations. U.S. Steel appealed its citations and fines, which were later reduced under a settlement agreement.\nIn February, a problem with a battery at the plant led to a \u201cbuildup of combustible material\u201d that ignited, causing an audible boom, officials said. Two workers received first aid treatment but were not seriously injured.\nPittsburgh attorney John Gismondi represented the widow of the worker who was killed in the 2009 explosion at the plant and three men who were badly burned in the 2010 explosion. In a phone interview Tuesday, Gismondi said his immediate thought a day earlier was, \u201cOh my God, not again at Clairton.\u201d\nBoth lawsuits were settled out of court for \u201csignificant\u201d amounts, he said.\n\u201cThere was no question in both of those cases we established that appropriate safety protocols weren\u2019t followed, and that\u2019s what led to the explosions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of gas on the premises. That\u2019s fine, it\u2019s part and parcel of what they do. But gas is a dangerous substance, and you need to make sure safety protocols are being followed.\u201d\nIn the 2010 case, Gismondi\u2019s clients claimed managers directed them to repair a live gas line even after an alarm went off warning of high levels of natural gas.\nAir quality concerns\nThe plant, a massive industrial facility along the Monongahela River, converts coal to coke, a key component in the steelmaking process. It is considered the largest coking operation in North America and is one of four major U.S. Steel plants in Pennsylvania.\nTo make coke, coal is baked in special ovens for hours at high temperatures to remove impurities that could otherwise weaken steel. The process creates what\u2019s known as coke gas \u2014 a lethal mix of methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.\nThe county health department initially told residents within a mile of the plant to remain indoors and close all windows and doors, but the agency lifted the advisory later Monday. Health officials said their monitors did not detect levels of soot or sulfur dioxide above federal standards.\nThe U.S. Steel buyout\nU.S. Steel has been a symbol of industrialization since it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie and others. It\u2019s been the icon of the American steel industry that once dominated the world market until Japan and then China became the top steelmakers over the last 40 years.\nIn June, U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel announced they had finalized a \u201chistoric partnership\u201d that gives the U.S. government a say in some matters. The deal came a year and a half after the Japanese company first proposed its nearly $15-billion buyout of the iconic American steelmaker.\nThe pursuit by Nippon Steel of the Pittsburgh-based company was buffeted by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state, dragging out the transaction for more than a year after U.S. Steel shareholders approved it.\nLevy, Puskar, Casey and Whittle write for the Associated Press.

      "text": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth belongs to an archconservative church network. Here\u2019s what to know\n- Share via\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says he\u2019s proud to be part of the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches, an archconservative network of Christian congregations.\nHegseth recently made headlines when he shared a CNN video on social media about CREC, showing its pastors arguing women should not have the right to vote.\nPastor Doug Wilson, a CREC co-founder, leads Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho, the network\u2019s flagship location. Jovial and media-friendly, Wilson is no stranger to stirring controversy with his church\u2019s hard-line theology and its embrace of patriarchy and Christian nationalism.\nWilson told the Associated Press on Monday he was grateful Hegseth shared the video. He noted Hegseth\u2019s post was labeled with Christ Church\u2019s motto: \u201cAll of Christ for All of Life.\u201d\n\u201cHe was, in effect, reposting it and saying, \u2018Amen,\u2019 at some level,\u201d Wilson said.\nHegseth, among President Trump\u2019s most controversial Cabinet picks, attends Pilgrim Hill Reformed Fellowship, a CREC member church in a suburb outside Nashville. His pastor, Brooks Potteiger, prayed at a service Hegseth hosted at the Pentagon.\nCREC recently opened a new outpost in the nation\u2019s capital, Christ Church DC, with Hegseth attending its first Sunday service.\nPentagon chief spokesman Sean Parnell confirmed Hegseth\u2019s CREC affiliation and told the AP that Hegseth \u201cvery much appreciates many of Mr. Wilson\u2019s writings and teachings.\u201d\nHere are other things to know about the church network.\nWhat does Wilson\u2019s church say about women?\nWilson\u2019s church and wider denomination practice complementarianism, the patriarchal idea that men and women have different God-given roles. Women within CREC churches cannot hold church leadership positions, and married women are to submit to their husbands.\nWilson told the AP he believes the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote \u201cwas a bad idea.\u201d Still, he said his wife and daughters vote.\nHe would prefer the United States follow his church\u2019s example, which allows heads of households to vote in church elections. Unmarried women qualify as voting members in his church.\n\u201cOrdinarily, the vote is cast by the head of the household, the husband and father, because we\u2019re patriarchal and not egalitarian,\u201d Wilson said. He added that repealing the 19th Amendment is not high on his list of priorities.\nHegseth\u2019s views on women have been in the spotlight, especially after he faced sexual assault allegations, for which no charges were filed. Before his nomination to lead the Defense Department, Hegseth had questioned women serving in combat roles in the military.\nWilson, a Navy veteran who served on submarines, also questions women serving in some military roles.\n\u201cI think we ought to find out the name of the person who suggested that we put women on those submarines and have that man committed,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a playpen that you put 50 cats in and then drop catnip in the middle of it. Whatever happens is going to be ugly. And if you think it\u2019s going to advance the cause of women and make sailors start treating women less like objects, then you haven\u2019t been around the block very many times.\u201d\nWhat is the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches?\nFounded in 1998, CREC is a network of more than 130 churches in the United States and around the world.\nCREC ascribes to a strict version of Reformed theology \u2014 rooted in the tradition of 16th century Protestant reformer John Calvin \u2014 that puts a heavy emphasis on an all-powerful God who has dominion over all of society.\nWilson and CREC are also strongly influenced by a 20th century Reformed movement called Christian Reconstructionism, according to Julie Ingersoll, a religion professor at the University of North Florida who wrote about it in her 2015 book \u201cBuilding God\u2019s Kingdom.\u201d\nShe sees that theology reflected in the Wilson slogan Hegseth repeated on social media.\n\u201cWhen he says, \u2018All of life,\u2019 he\u2019s referencing the idea that it\u2019s the job of Christians to exercise dominion over the whole world,\u201d Ingersoll said.\nSince the 1970s, Wilson\u2019s ministry and influence have grown to include the Assn. of Christian Classical Schools and New Saint Andrew\u2019s College in Moscow, Idaho.\nThe ministry has a robust media presence, including Canon Press, publisher of books such as \u201cThe Case for Christian Nationalism\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s Good to Be a Man: A Handbook for Godly Masculinity.\u201d\nWhat is the connection to Christian nationalism?\nWilson wants the United States to be a Christian nation. He does not mind being called a Christian nationalist.\n\u201cI am more than happy to work with that label because it\u2019s a better label than what I usually get called,\u201d Wilson said.\n\u201cIf I get called a white nationalist or a theo-fascist or a racist bigot, misogynist thug, I can\u2019t work with them except to deny them,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a Christian, and I\u2019m a patriot who loves my country. How do I combine those two things? How do they work together?\u201d\nU.S. Christian nationalism is a fusion of American and Christian identity, principles and symbols that typically seek a privileged place for Christian people and ideas. Wilson contends that early America was Christian, a notion historians dispute.\n\u201cIf we succeed, this will be Christian America 2.0,\u201d Wilson wrote in 2022.\nAmerican Christian nationalism involves overlapping movements. Among them are evangelicals who view Trump, a Republican, as a champion, some of whom are influenced by Christian Reconstructionist ideas; a charismatic movement that sees politics as part of a larger spiritual war; and a Catholic postliberal movement envisioning a muscular government promoting traditional morality.\nCREC now has a closer relationship to the upper echelons of government. This has renewed scrutiny of Wilson\u2019s other controversial views, including his downplaying of the horrors of Southern slavery in the United States. But it has also given Wilson a bigger stage.\nHegseth and Wilson have spoken approvingly of each other. Wilson said they have only met in person once, when they talked informally after Wilson preached at Hegseth\u2019s home church in Tennessee this year.\nWilson said CREC\u2019s new Washington church began as a way to serve church members who relocated to work in the Trump administration.\n\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve had connections with as many people in national government as we do now,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cBut this is not an ecclesiastical lobbying effort where we\u2019re trying to meet important people. We\u2019re trying to give some of these people an opportunity to meet with God.\u201d\nStanley and Smith write for the Associated Press. Smith reported from Pittsburgh."

This follows a previous transfer of 29 cartel members earlier this year, amid increasing pressure from the Trump administration on Mexico to address drug-related crime. In a separate context, President Trump has announced the deployment of National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to address crime, despite local officials asserting that crime rates have significantly declined in recent years.",
