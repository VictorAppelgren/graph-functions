  "content": "SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) is one of the must-buy small-cap stocks to invest in. On August 19, UBS reiterated a \u2018Neutral\u2019 rating on the stock and raised its price target to $30 from $20. The price target hike comes on the stock rallying by more than 100% year to date.\n\nUBS raised its price target for the stock, impressed by SolarEdge\u2019s prospects in the push for market share in the US residential inverter market amid the shift towards leased systems. The company boasts of a robust relationship with third-party ownership (TPO) partners, expected to strengthen its prospects in the industry.\n\nIn addition, the company boasts of products specifically designed to support the TPO model. Similarly, UBS expects SolarEdge to gain market share in the commercial and industrial segments as foreign entities, subject to concern restrictions, are expected to eliminate competitors for customers seeking tax credits.\n\nSolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) is a company that specializes in clean energy solutions, focusing on the production, consumption, and management of solar energy. It works on DC-optimized inverter solutions, which maximize energy production in solar PV systems.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of SEDG as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "text": "In this article, we will look at the 10 Best Organic Food and Farming Stocks to Buy Now.\nThe organic food industry has evolved from a niche market into a mainstream sector. The segment is growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.9% and is expected to be worth $564.22 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research. Growing awareness about the health benefits and environmental concerns is one of the factors driving growth in the organic food market.\nEnvironmentally friendly production techniques and ethical agricultural methods have also become essential components of the natural food movement, as customers seek food items that support their health objectives.\nThe organic food market is also expanding as a result of governments worldwide encouraging clean eating and enforcing stricter food labeling laws. Stronger brand loyalty and the capacity to command premium pricing are some of the benefits organic food firms are enjoying.\nCompanies investing in plant-based alternatives and sustainable farming technologies have emerged as big winners amid the organic food revolution. With the global healthy food market expected to be worth $2.26 trillion by 2035, exciting investment opportunities are emerging around the best organic food and farming stocks.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s look at the 10 Best Organic Food and Farming Stocks to Buy Now.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of the 10 Best Organic Food and Farming Stocks to Buy Now, we scanned the US equity markets, focusing on organic food and farming companies.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nBest Organic Food and Farming Stocks to Buy Now\n10.

      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock.

      "text": "In this article, we will take a look at the 10 Must-Buy Small-Cap Stocks to Invest In.\nLarge-cap tech giants have been the catalyst behind the US equity market rallying to record highs. However, with momentum at all-time highs waning, it\u2019s become clear that mega-cap tech stocks may not be the only game in town. Heads of equity trading at Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase believe it is time for small caps, which have lagged behind the overall market, to catch up.\nThe rotation away from mega-tech stocks comes as investors seek attractive opportunities in the equity markets at highly discounted valuations in small-cap stocks.\n\u201cThere will be significant buying from systematic traders and discretionary investors who haven\u2019t captured as much of this rally as they would have liked. Now, they\u2019re under-positioned and have lost money to use to buy some of these laggards,\u201d said Stuart Kaiser, who runs Citigroup\u2019s desk as head of US equity trading strategy.\nThe increased focus on small-cap stocks also comes amid growing expectations that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. The interest rate cuts are expected to lower the cost of capital needed for investing and boost consumer spending. Small-cap companies benefit the most in a low-interest-rate environment, as they can access the capital needed to expand their businesses at a lower cost.\n\u201cIf the Fed cuts rates in September, this would greatly benefit small caps, as many small caps are levered to the economy and also financially,\u201d said Larry Tentarelli, founder of the Blue Chip Trend Report.\nWhile the S&P 500 has rallied to all-time highs, the Russell 2000 index, which tracks small-cap stocks, is still down by about 7% from its November highs. The underperformance highlights the room for growth in small-cap stocks amid the rotation from mega-cap stocks.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 Must-Buy Small Cap Stocks to Invest in.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile a list of must-buy small-cap stocks to invest in, we utilized the Finviz stock screener to filter for small-cap stocks with a market capitalization of between $300 million and $2 billion. We then focused on stocks that have rallied by more than 100% year to date (as of August 22) and are popular among elite hedge funds, as of Q2 2025. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their year-to-date gains.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is straightforward: our research has demonstrated that we can outperform the market by replicating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nMust-Buy Small-Cap Stocks to Invest In\n10. Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ADPT)\nMarket cap: $1.92 Billion\nYear-to-date returns: 104.04%\nNumber of hedge fund holders: 26\nAdaptive Biotechnologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ADPT) is one of the must-buy small-cap stocks to invest in. On August 18, the company confirmed it will end its strategic collaboration and license agreement with Genentech effective February 9, 2026. The strategic collaboration focuses on the research and development of cancer cell therapy products.\nThe termination of the agreement will relieve Adaptive Biotechnologies of exclusive obligations related to oncology cell therapies.

      "text": "In this article, we will discuss the Top 10 Materials Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\nMaterials stocks are shares of companies that produce or supply raw materials, including metals, chemicals, and construction supplies. These stocks typically rise or fall in response to industrial demand for materials used in manufacturing, construction, and emerging technologies.\nThe materials sector is experiencing a notable resurgence in 2025 following several challenging years. In the past six months alone (as of July 3, 2025), the S&P 500 Materials index has gained 8.78%, outpacing the broader S&P 500\u2019s 6.76% return. This marks the first time in two years that the Materials index is outperforming the broad market.\nAnalysts had identified compelling opportunities within the sector well before this turnaround materialized. Fidelity analysts projected a \u201cbullish long-term story\u201d for the materials sector in 2025 and beyond, while McKinsey emphasized that the ongoing energy transition is fundamentally reshaping the materials landscape. McKinsey outlined three major shifts: rising demand for materials embedded in low-carbon technologies, a shift in demand toward metals like lithium, copper, and nickel, and a decline in thermal coal\u2019s role in the energy system.\nSector-specific dynamics further reinforce the investment thesis. Analysts are most optimistic about the Basic Materials subsector, supported by improving market conditions. According to Morningstar analysts, lithium\u2014a key material driving the electric vehicle revolution\u2014reached multi-year lows in 2024 \u201cas supply grew faster than demand in 2023 and 2024.\u201d However, the analysts note that \u201cdemand continues to increase from higher global electric vehicle sales and the buildout of utility-scale batteries used in energy storage systems.\u201d They forecast higher prices in the near term as supply cuts move the market closer to balance, particularly in the second half of 2025.\nOur Methodology\nTo identify the top 10 materials stocks favored by analysts, we compiled the initial pool of materials companies by analyzing sector-specific ETF holdings and established industry rankings. Our selection criteria focused on companies with favorable analyst coverage. To enhance our analysis, we incorporated hedge fund sentiment as a key validation metric, utilizing institutional holding data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database as of Q1 2025. The final list prioritizes stocks based on their average upside potential, measured as of July 7, 2025.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nTop 10 Materials Stocks to Buy According to Analysts\n10. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM)\nAverage Upside Potential as of July 7: 9.17%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 65\nNewmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is one of the top 10 materials stocks to buy according to analysts. On July 3, the company\u2019s \u201cBuy\u201d rating was reaffirmed at UBS. UBS also raised the price target for Newmont\u2019s stock to $68 from $60.\nAccording to UBS, gold prices have \u201crepeatedly reached new highs this year.\u201d They stated that, at one point, the prices surpassed $3,500 per ounce, marking an almost 30% increase since the beginning of the year. This surge in gold prices, amidst an \u201cuncertain trade war outlook and escalating concerns about an economic recession,\u201d is noted as a significant opportunity for investors in gold mining stocks like Newmont.\nUBS analysts also touched on Newmont\u2019s financial performance. They noted that the company reported strong Q1 FY2025 earnings, with earnings per share (EPS) of $1.25, significantly exceeding analysts\u2019 consensus estimates of $0.71. The analysts also noted that the company is on track to meet its 2025 guidance, with the first-quarter results aligning with the indications provided in February 2025.\nNewmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), one of the world\u2019s largest gold mining companies, operates across five continents and is a producer of copper, silver, zinc, and lead. Its flagship assets include Boddington in Australia and Yanacocha in Peru. The company plays a vital role in supplying metals essential for global electrification and infrastructure. Some of Newmont\u2019s standout aspects include its large-scale operations, strong cash generation, and strategic diversification across multiple geographies and commodities.\n9. The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW)\nAverage Upside Potential as of July 7: 10.11%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 68\nThe Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is one of the top 10 materials stocks to buy according to analysts. On June 13, Citi lowered its rating on Sherwin-Williams stock from Buy to Neutral, citing concerns about the housing market\u2019s future prospects. The firm also reduced its price target from $405.00 to $385.00.\nCiti analysts pointed to \u201csustained pressure from elevated mortgage rates\u201d as a significant factor. They also cited \u201cdelayed expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts,\u201d which are \u201cdampening hopes for a meaningful housing recovery in the second half of 2025.\u201d The firm noted suppressed housing dynamics, including sluggish existing home sales and a challenging environment for homebuilders, indicating few signs of a market recovery in the latter half of the year.\nWhile the analysts acknowledge Sherwin-Williams as a strong long-term player with solid market share potential and view its long-term market share growth story as intact, they believe current conditions suggest limited upside in the short term. As such, the firm stated that without clear near-term catalysts, the stock\u2019s risk-reward profile is less compelling. The research note suggested that investors wait for a better entry point before purchasing Sherwin-Williams shares.\nThe Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) develops, manufactures, and sells paints, coatings, and related products to professional, industrial, commercial, and retail customers. With operations across the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Australia, it serves markets through brands like Valspar and its own Sherwin-Williams stores. Analysts favor the company for its scale, global reach, and consistent dividend growth, having raised its payout for 48 consecutive years."
