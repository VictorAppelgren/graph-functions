  "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nSpace-based solar power has the potential to reduce Europe's need for land-based renewable energy by up to 80%\u2014a potential game-changer for reaching net-zero by 2050.\n\nFor the first time, researchers from King's College London have assessed the possible impact that generating solar energy in space could have for Europe. They found it could cut energy battery storage needs by more than two-thirds.\n\nThe study, published in Joule, analyzed the potential of a design by NASA for solar generation, which is planned to be in use by 2050.\n\nThe findings show the design could also save money by reducing the cost of the whole power system in Europe by up to 15%, including energy generation, storage and network infrastructure costs\u2014an estimated saving of 35.9 billion euros per year.\n\nThis paper is the first to look at how useful this form of renewable energy generation could be when used for European energy grids. It is also the first to provide a cost estimation of using this technology in the European market.\n\nProfessor Wei He, lead author and a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Engineering at King's College London, said, \"For the first time we have shown the positive impact this technology could provide for Europe. Although the feasibility of this technology is still under review, our research highlights its vast economic and environmental potential if adopted.\n\n\"Reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 is going to require a significant shift to renewable energy, and this emerging technology could play a pivotal role in that transition.\"\n\nWidespread use of renewable energy is crucial for reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. However, there are significant challenges in the scale of the investment required and the pace of technological innovation.\n\nSolar energy gathered in space is less likely to be affected by cloud cover and is safe from natural disasters such as flooding and earthquakes, which infrastructure on Earth is vulnerable to.\n\nNASA's RD1, which was analyzed for this study, is one of two designs for space-based solar power (SBSP) systems designed by NASA.\n\nSpace-based solar power generation involves in-space continuous collection of solar energy. This involves placing large solar panels on satellites in orbit, where they are exposed to much more sunlight and can continuously collect energy without being affected by clouds or the day-night cycle.\n\nThis energy would then be transmitted to one or more stations on Earth. It is then converted to electricity and delivered to the energy grid or batteries for storage.",
