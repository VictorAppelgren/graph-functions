It would appear that money creates a lose-lose scenario: If you don\u2019t have it, your performance suffers, your relationships suffer, and you may die sooner. But, if you have great wealth, you may be more likely to engage in victim blaming, and less likely to help others by choice.\nHow do we solve this conflict? Do we have to choose between caring about people and caring about money? How do we create lives of great value, without compromising our own deep values? We do it by working with our psychology. By mindfully developing a healthy relationship with money and learning some simple new ways of thinking, we can avoid the psychological dangers that can accompany both poverty and wealth.\nOther similar profiles\nExplore top content on LinkedIn\nFind curated posts and insights for relevant topics all in one place.\nView top content"

      "text": "The U.S. Department of Education today announced its Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) will resume collections of its defaulted federal student loan portfolio on Monday, May 5th. The Department has not collected on defaulted loans since March 2020. Resuming collections protects taxpayers from shouldering the cost of federal student loans that borrowers willingly undertook to finance their postsecondary education. This initiative will be paired with a comprehensive communications and outreach campaign to ensure borrowers understand how to return to repayment or get out of default.\nWhile Congress mandated that student and parent borrowers begin to repay their student loans in October 2023, the Biden-Harris Administration refused to lift the collections pause and kept borrowers in a confusing limbo. The previous Administration failed to process applications for borrowers who applied for income-driven repayment and continued to push misguided \u201con-ramps\u201d and illegal loan forgiveness schemes to win points with borrowers and mask rising delinquency and default rates.\n\u201cAmerican taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon. \u201cThe Biden Administration misled borrowers: the executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear. Hundreds of billions have already been transferred to taxpayers. Going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment\u2014both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation\u2019s economic outlook.\u201d\nFederal student loans are financed by the American people. Instead of protecting responsible taxpayers, the Biden-Harris Administration put them on the hook for irresponsible lending, pushing the federal student loan portfolio toward a fiscal cliff:\n- Today, 42.7 million borrowers owe more than $1.6 trillion in student debt.\n- More than 5 million borrowers have not made a monthly payment in over 360 days and sit in default\u2014many for more than 7 years\u2014and 4 million borrowers are in late-stage delinquency (91-180 days). As a result, there could be almost 10 million borrowers in default in a few months. When this happens, almost 25 percent of the federal student loan portfolio will be in default.\n- Only 38 percent of borrowers are in repayment and current on their student loans. Most of the remaining borrowers are either delinquent on their payments, in an interest-free forbearance, or in an interest-free deferment. A small percentage of borrowers are in a 6-month grace period or in-school.\n- Currently, almost 1.9 million borrowers have been unable to even begin repayment because of a processing pause put in place by the previous administration. Since August 2024, the Department has not processed applications for enrollment in any repayment plan such as Income-Based Repayment, Income-Contingent Repayment, or PAYE. The Department is currently working with its federal student loan servicers and anticipates processing to begin next month.\nInvoluntary Collections for Defaulted Borrowers\nFSA will restart the Treasury Offset Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, on Monday, May 5, 2025. All borrowers in default will receive email communications from FSA over the next 2 weeks making them aware of these developments and urging them to contact the Default Resolution Group to make a monthly payment, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan, or sign up for loan rehabilitation. Later this summer, FSA will send required notices beginning administrative wage garnishment.\nThe Department will also authorize guaranty agencies that they may begin involuntary collections activities on loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. All FSA collection activities are required under the Higher Education Act and conducted only after student and parent borrowers have been provided sufficient notice and opportunity to repay their loans under the law.\nSupport for Current and Struggling Borrowers\nFSA is committed to keeping borrowers updated with clear information about their payment options to put them on a productive path toward repaying their federal student loans. Over the next two months, FSA will conduct a robust communications campaign to engage all borrowers on the importance of repayment. FSA will conduct outreach to borrowers through emails and social media reminding them of their obligations and providing resources and support to assist them in selecting the best repayment plan, like the new Loan Simulator, AI Assistant (Aiden), and extended servicers call times. FSA will also launch an enhanced Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) process, simplifying the time that it will take borrowers to enroll in IDR plans and eliminating the need for borrowers to recertify their income every year. More information will be posted on StudentAid.gov next week.\nFSA intends to enlist its partners \u2013 states, institutions of higher education, financial aid administrators, college access and success organizations, third-party servicers, and other stakeholders \u2013 to assist in this campaign to restore commonsense and fairness with the message: student and parent borrowers \u2013 not taxpayers \u2013 must repay their student loans. There will not be any mass loan forgiveness. Together, these actions will move the federal student loan portfolio back into repayment, which benefits borrowers and taxpayers alike.\nDetailed information to help borrowers get out of default is also available at StudentAid.gov/end-default."

      "text": "But data and commentary from earnings season thus far indicate that most consumers are proving to be adroit managers of credit, particularly credit cards.\nAlthough delinquencies have been on the rise, depending on where you look, they\u2019re coming off a small base, and individual firms are reporting stable-to-improving credit metrics as they weigh in with their latest quarterly reports.\nBy the Numbers\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported this week that national household debt reached $18.4 trillion in the second quarter of 2025, increasing by $185 billion. This represents a 1% rise from the first quarter of the year and a 3.3% increase compared to the same period in 2024. Mortgage balances are roughly 71% of the tally.\nCredit card debt rebounded and almost fully reversed declines recorded in the first quarter. In the second quarter, it reached $1.2 trillion, nearly matching the peak observed in the final quarter of 2024. Student loan balances continued to climb for the fourth straight quarter, reaching $1.6 trillion, which is $7 billion higher than in the first quarter. Altogether, non-housing balances rose by $45 billion, representing a 0.9% increase from the previous quarter.\nDelinquency rates increased slightly compared to the first quarter. The report showed that 4.4% of outstanding debt is in some stage of delinquency, up from 4.3% last quarter and marking the highest level since 2020. Serious delinquencies, defined as debt that is 90 days or more past due, rose to 3% percent of total debt. This represents a 6.8% increase from the previous quarter and a 65% rise year over year. The last metric reads as an alarming one, but the read-across is that 97% of debt is not in that troubled stage.\nThe increase was mainly driven by student loans, which are now out of a repayment pause that stretched out over five years. In the second quarter, 10.2% of student loan balances were seriously delinquent, a 31% increase from the previous quarter.\nHowever, the share of mortgages, HELOCs and credit card balances in serious delinquency decreased, falling to 0.82%, 0.85% and 12.2%, respectively.\nYoung Consumers Bear Watching\nWhen examining the data by age group, debt among consumers younger than 30 years old rebounded, reaching $1.11 trillion after falling to $1.05 trillion in the previous quarter. Consumers in their 30s and 40s also experienced an increase in debt balances. These three age groups have the highest share of individuals in serious delinquency. Among consumers under 30, 4.6% are seriously delinquent. This figure is 37% higher than what was recorded in the first quarter and is the highest since 2017. Among consumers in their 30s, 3.5% are seriously delinquent. This rate has doubled compared to the same period last year and is now at its highest level since 2014.\nThe Day-to-Day Debt Management\nIn another report from the Federal Reserve, known as G19, in the second quarter, consumer credit grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.3%, marking an acceleration from the 1.2% pace in the first quarter. In June, total consumer credit rose at a 1.8% annualized rate, bringing the outstanding balance to $5.01 trillion, matching the highest level since November 2024. Compared to June 2024, outstanding credit increased by 2.1%.\nThere is evidence that consumers are chipping away at card balances. Revolving credit \u2014 a category that includes but is not limited to cards \u2014 edged down at an annual rate of 1% in June, following a 3.5% decline in May.\nThere\u2019s reason to think that young consumers are not the lost generation when it comes to using credit. As Karen Webster wrote in a Wednesday (Aug. 6) column, citing PYMNTS Intelligence data, \u201cGen Z saves 36% of their income, 10 points more than older generations. But they don\u2019t just stick it in a checking account. They diversify. Some of it goes to digital wallets. Some into high-yield savings. Some into crypto.\u201d\n\u201cGen Z understands the power of credit,\u201d she added. \u201cThey\u2019ve watched credit scores shape everything from car loans to job offers. So, they use credit with intent.\u201d\nGeneration Z is nearly three times more likely to use credit-builder products than older consumers, she wrote, which in turn indicates an awareness and desire to cement responsible habits.\nPayment networks have weighed in, too, with earnings results that showed debit spending largely outpacing credit volumes, which would indicate some prudence and shifting in payment behaviors, using cash on hand.\nElsewhere, during JPMorgan\u2019s earnings call July 15, Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum told analysts: \u201cIf you look at indicators of stress, not surprisingly, you see a little bit more stress in the lower-income bands than you see in the higher-income bands. But that\u2019s always true\u2026 And nothing there is out of line with our expectations. Our delinquency rates are also in line with expectations \u2026 all of that looks fine.\u201d"
