      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Following word this past spring that a package was coming together for a Rambo prequel, Millennium Media looks to have its man as sources tell Deadline that Noah Centineo is attached to star in John Rambo. Sisu director Jalmari Helander is set to direct from a screenplay by writing duo Rory Haines and Sohrab Noshirvani.\nSources say the plan is to shoot top of 2026 in Thailand. Insiders also add that while no deals are in place, Lionsgate is the front-runner to land the package. The studio has released the past two Rambo pics and also has a relationship with Helander having worked with him on Sisu.\nThe film\u2019s plot is under wraps, but it will be the origin story of a young John Rambo during the Vietnam War. One of the most iconic action heroes in U.S. cinema, the character was created by David Morell in his novel First Blood. The original 1982 film saw saw Sylvester Stallone play the veteran Green Beret, who is forced by a cruel sheriff and his deputies to flee into the mountains and wage an escalating one-man war against his pursuers. The five movies in the franchise have generated more than $800 million worldwide; the most recent, 2019\u2019s Rambo: Last Blood, produced by Millennium and Sly\u2019s Balboa, made $92M at the box office.\nWatch on Deadline\nAs for Stallone, when Deadline first reported on the package, insiders told Deadline he was aware of the project but was not involved, and as of today that remains the same. Sources now say that Stallone has been alerted to Centineo\u2019s attachment.\nProducers on the latest installment are Kevin King-Templeton on behalf of Templeton Media, Les Weldon, Jonathan Yunger and Avi Lerner. Executive producers include Trevor Short and Bonfire Legends\u2019 Dallas Sonnier and Amanda Presmyk.\nAs for Centineo, his star has been on the rise after breakout roles in the Netflix hit series To All the Boys I Loved Before and The Recruit, but this is sort of role that could launch a young star onto the A-list. Up next, he will star as Ken Masters in Legendary\u2019s live-action adaptation of Street Fighter, starring opposite Jason Momoa and Andrew Koji. Directed by Kitao Sakurai, the film is slated for release in 2026.\nMost recently, Centineo appeared in A24\u2019s Warfare from Ray Mendoza and Alex Garland, as well as in Oscar Boyson\u2019s directorial debut Our Hero, Balthazar, which he also produced under his Arkhum banner. The latter premiered at this year\u2019s Tribeca Film Festival.\nCentineo is repped by WME and Myman Greenspan Fox.\nWe need a Barnes from Platoon prequel\u2026\nGet Stallone to bookend the film by telling his story in flashback. And contact author David Morrell, he said years ago he had fully fleshed out in details Rambo\u2019s vietnam history.\nStraight to VHS\nHahahhahahaha\nIm excited. I love Rambo. Let\u2019s hope Sly will come at the end. No Rambo without him.\nThey need to stick to the book where Rambo gets killed by the is colonel at the end of the original book\nRecreate it yourself, with you as Rambo."

      "text": "Sylvester Stallone appeared on a recent episode of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d and gave Ryan Gosling his blessing to star as the next Rambo in a potential revival of Stallone\u2019s iconic action franchise. Stallone played the United States Army Special Forces veteran in five movies. The first \u201cRambo\u201d opened in 1982. Stallone presumably said goodbye to the franchise in 2019\u2019s \u201cRambo: Last Blood.\u201d\n\u201cI met [Ryan Gosling] at a dinner,\u201d Stallone said when asked why Gosling is his top pick to play a new iteration of Rambo. \u201cObviously we are opposites. He\u2019s good looking. I\u2019m not. Seriously! Could you imagine me as Ken? It doesn\u2019t work at all.\u201d\n\u201c[Ryan] goes, \u2018I was fascinated by Rambo and I used to go to school dressed as Rambo and people would chase me away and I still didn\u2019t stop. I\u2019d vacation as Rambo.\u2019 He just kept saying that he had a lot of affiliation with Rambo,\u201d Stallone continued. \u201cAnd I thought, you know, this is interesting. If I ever pass the baton, I\u2019ll pass it on to him because he loves the character.\u201d\nPopular on Variety\nWhen pressed further about Gosling taking over the iconic action role, Stallone said, \u201cI would say yes but I don\u2019t know if anyone would say, \u2018Hey, he\u2019s too good-looking to be Rambo.\u2019\u201d\nGosling, for what it\u2019s worth, is already an outspoken \u201cRambo\u201d fan. The actor appeared on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back in 2011 and told then-host Jay Leno that \u201cFirst Blood,\u201d the first movie to feature Stallone as Rambo, \u201cput a spell on\u201d him so much that he thought he was actually Rambo.\n\u201cI even thought my face felt like Sylvester Stallone\u2019s and I put a bunch of steak knives in my Fisher-Price Houdini kit,\u201d Gosling remembered at the time. \u201cI took it to school the next day and I threw them at all the kids at recess.\u201d\nGosling now has Stallone\u2019s blessing to play Rambo should he want in the future. As for Stallone saying he doesn\u2019t have the looks to pull off Gosling\u2019s Oscar-nominated role as Ken in \u201cBarbie,\u201d it\u2019s somewhat ironic considering Stallone was a big visual inspiration for the character. Gosling told Variety that Stallone\u2019s wardrobe during the 1980s inspired Ken\u2019s trademark mink coat.\n\u201cWe found out that Stallone wore a lot of minks,\u201d Gosling said. \u201cAs long as Ken was wearing it, he was the Ken with the mink \u2014 and that separated him from the other Kens.\u201d\nGosling will be back in action star mode when Universal\u2019s \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d kicks off the summer movie season on May 3."
