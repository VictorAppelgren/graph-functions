  "title": "Cenovus Energy to Buy MEG Energy in C$7.9 Billion Oil-Sands Tie-Up \u2014 Update",
  "description": "",
  "content": "Cenovus Energy is buying rival MEG Energy for 7.9 billion Canadian dollars, about $5.68 billion, the latest consolidation move in Canada's oil patch as producers bulk up in the country's vast oil-sands region.\n\nThe cash-and stock deal, which includes debt, announced Friday, is set to create a combined producer pumping about 720,000 barrels of oil a day, solidifying Cenovus's position as a major player in Alberta's oil sands. Under the deal terms MEG shareholders will receive C$27.25 a share, 75% of which will be in cash and the other 25% in Cenovus stock. The deal represents a 33% premium to MEG's average price before rival Strathcona Resources launched a takeover bid in May.\n\nShares of MEG energy have been up this year, rising about 17% since the start of the year to close on Thursday at C$27.56.\n\nEarlier in the spring, Strathcona Resources, another Alberta-based oil and gas producer, began its own bid to buy out MEG in cash and stock, a deal with only a 9.2% premium that the MEG board urged shareholders not to accept. Instead, MEG launched a strategic review of alternatives that began in mid-June as the company sought to surface an offer superior to its standalone plan.\n\nThe current acquisition adds MEG's Christina Lake operations, which have approvals to produce up to 210,000 barrels a day, to Cenovus's more than 3 million acres across Alberta and British Columbia, as well as operations and exploration prospects offshore in the Asia Pacific region and Newfoundland and Labrador. Cenovus said the deal would be immediately accretive to cash flow, with annual synergies expected to rise to C$400 million by 2028.\n\nTo fund the purchase, Cenovus secured a C$2.7 billion term loan, and a C$2.5 billion bridge facility, and the company said it has plans to launch a senior debt offering to eventually cover the latter.\n\nCanada's big oil-sands producers have been the belles of the ball, with the sector attracting buyers thanks to strong demand for energy amid geopolitical tensions and production cuts by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies.\n\nLast October, Chevron sold its stakes in some oil-sands and shale assets to Canadian Natural Resources for $6.5 billion, while a year ago, Suncor agreed to buy the Canadian operations of France's TotalEnergies for a little over $1 billion to bolster its oil-sands business in the region.\n\nThat same month, natural-gas producer Tourmaline Oil agreed to buy Bonavista Energy for almost $1.1 billion. In May 2023, Crescent Point Energy completed the purchase of Spartan Delta's oil-and-gas assets in the Montney region of Alberta for about $1.2 billion.\n\nInterest among producers has also been piqued since the Trans Mountain pipeline became operational last spring, increasing the capability of a line that existed since the 1950s and offers greater capacity to ship Alberta oil to the Pacific Coast and to Asian markets.\n\nThe Cenovus-MEG acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year.",
