  "description": "Free DC, a \u201cfiscally sponsored special project\u201d of progressive nonprofits Community Change and Community Change Action, brought 150 demonstrators near the White House Monday to protest Trump\u2019s plan\u2026",
  "content": "Several lefty, dark money organizations, including George Soros\u2019, contributed more than $20 million to groups funding protests against President Trump\u2019s crime crackdown in Washington, DC.\n\nFree DC, a \u201cfiscally sponsored special project\u201d of progressive nonprofits Community Change and Community Change Action, brought 150 demonstrators near the White House Monday to protest Trump\u2019s plan to deploy National Guard troops in the district and federalize the city\u2019s police department.\n\n\u201cDo not obey in advance\u201d and \u201cTake up space\u201d are among Free DC\u2019s \u201cguiding principles,\u201d and the group urges supporters to \u201cgo outside at 8:00 PM and bang pots and pans, sing, chant, or make noise for five minutes\u201d every night \u201cof this occupation.\u201d\n\nFree DC has scheduled multiple events since Monday\u2019s anti-Trump protest, including a \u201cCop Watch Training,\u201d suggesting further protests are planned amid Trump\u2019s effort to make DC the \u201csafest, cleanest and most beautiful cities anywhere in the world\u201d \u2013 by ramping up law enforcement efforts and removing homeless encampments from public places.\n\nCommunity Change and Community Change Action, the groups bankrolling Free DC\u2019s activism campaign, have been the beneficiaries of millions of dollars in donations from hedge-fund tycoon George Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations and Tides Foundation, and the dark-money Arabella Advisors network, according to an analysis shared with The Post.\n\n\u201cIt is ironic that a protest to ostensibly \u2018Free DC\u2019 was hosted by Community Change, a group funded by massive amounts of outside dark money to push a pro-crime agenda,\u201d Caitlin Sutherland, the executive director of nonprofit watchdog Americans for Public Trust, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cDC is facing shootings, carjackings, and assaults, and yet progressive groups like The Pritzker Foundation, George Soros, and the Arabella Network all spend millions of dollars to manufacture protests that weaken our communities,\u201d Sutherland added.\n\nIn 2023 alone, Community Change and Community Change Action received $4 million from Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations, $680,000 from the Arabella network, and $145,000 from the Tides Foundation, Americans for Public Trust found in publicly available financial disclosures.\n\nArabella Advisors, a Washington, D.C.-based consulting firm, manages several funds that finance left-wing groups, including the Sixteen Thirty Fund, Windward Fund, New Venture Fund, which have all given money to Community Change and Community Change Action since 2020.\n\nSimilarly, Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations and Tides Foundation and Tides Advocacy (part of the billionaires\u2019 Tides Network) are far-left grantmaking organizations.\n\nBetween 2020-2023, Community Change and Community Change Action received $12.6 million from Open Society Foundation, $5.6 million from the Arabella network, and $1.9 million from the Tides network \u2013 under numerous grants labeled for such purposes as \u201ccivil rights, social action, advocacy\u201d and \u201csocial welfare activities.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Community Change received $1 million across 2021 and 2022 from Future Forward USA Action, a Democratic Party-aligned super PAC affiliated with Future Forward PAC \u2013 one of the major political groups that backed former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much of this money has been directly used by Free DC, which says on its website it began organizing in 2023, in response to a congressional effort to block a controversial update to DC\u2019s criminal code.\n\nFree DC and Community Change did not respond to The Post\u2019s requests for comment.",

      "text": "Republicans celebrate as Biden signs resolution to reverse DC crime bill\nPresident Biden on Monday signed a Republican-sponsored bill to block a controversial update to Washington, DC\u2019s criminal code that would have lowered maximum penalties for certain violent crimes, including carjackings.\nThe White House released a brief note on Monday announcing the 80-year-old president\u2019s signing of \u201cH.J.Res. 26, which nullifies the Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022 enacted by the Council of the District of Columbia.\u201d\nBiden revealed earlier this month that he would not stand in the way of Congress if it voted to nix DC\u2019s crime bill, a move which enraged many Democrats and supporters of DC home rule.\nRepublicans in Congress slammed the DC Council\u2019s changes to the district\u2019s criminal code as \u201csoft-on-crime\u201d and used the chamber\u2019s rarely used oversight responsibilities over DC to nix the legislation \u2013 making it only the fourth District law since the early 1970s to be revoked by Congress, according to CNN.\n\u201cPresident Biden officially signed my bipartisan resolution to block the D.C. Council\u2019s dangerous overhaul of Washington\u2019s criminal code into law,\u201d Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.), who sponsored the resolution, said in a tweet Monday.\n\u201cThis is a major first step to restoring law and order in our nation\u2019s capital city,\u201d he added.\nThe district\u2019s bill would have lowered the max sentence for carjacking from 21 years \u2014 40 if armed with a gun \u2014 to 18 years, or 24 if armed. The max penalty for armed robbery would have been reduced from 45 years to 20 years.\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on Monday said the GOP \u201cwill continue to lead the fight for safe communities.\u201d\n\u201cHad Republicans not won the House majority \u2026 Had we not made the Commitment to America \u2026 Had we not taken action to nullify DC\u2019s soft-on-crime law \u2026 This victory would not be possible,\u201d McCarthy said in reaction to Biden signing the Republican-sponsored measure.\n\u201cHouse Republicans will continue to lead the fight for safe communities across the country,\u201d the House speaker added.\nThe DC Council attempted to withdraw the crime bill from congressional consideration earlier this month amid signs that it would be overturned, but the Home Rule Act, which governs the district, does not allow for the withdrawal of legislation.\nDC Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, initially opposed the DC Council\u2019s changes, but her veto of the crime bill was overturned by the council.\nBowser expressed concern that \u201cthe council substantially reduced penalties for robberies, carjackings and home invasion burglaries,\u201d however, the mayor opposed congressional intervention into DC\u2019s governance.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Congress should ever interfere in our local governance. They can because we live under the indignity of limited home rule,\u201d Bowser said in a tweet earlier this month.\nBack on March 3, Biden explained his decision not to veto the nixing of the DC crime bill by citing the issue of carjacking in the district and Bowser\u2019s initial disapproval of the lowering of certain criminal penalties.\n\u201cI support D.C. Statehood and home-rule \u2013 but I don\u2019t support some of the changes D.C. Council put forward over the Mayor\u2019s objections \u2013 such as lowering penalties for carjackings,\u201d Biden wrote in a tweet."

      "text": "President Trump and left-wing billionaire financier George Soros have more in common than previous thought, according to someone who has worked for both men.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent told an exclusive audience of billionaires at the annual Allen & Co. conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, this week that both men share a common personality trait: impatience when navigating high-stakes negotiations.\nPeople in the room told Bloomberg News on condition of anonymity due to the closed-door nature of the event that Bessent made the comparison after being asked by the moderator to reflect on his time working for both Soros and Trump.\nThe conference, often referred to as the \u201csummer camp for billionaires,\u201d is off-limits to journalists and the public.\nBessent told the crowd that Trump and Soros are alike in their temperament, demands and impatience, particularly when implementing decisions after identifying problems and solutions.\nThe secretary, who began his association with Soros in 1991 when he joined Soros Fund Management shortly after graduating from Yale University, noted that he often advises the president to be patient as they navigate the rollout of trade announcements.\nDespite Trump\u2019s impatience, Bessent credited the president with a sharp instinct for identifying problems and devising effective responses.\nHe also downplayed concerns that the administration\u2019s aggressive tariff policy was contributing to inflation and predicted two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Bessent told the group that long-term borrowing costs would likely return to pre-pandemic levels.\nHe noted that investors are currently pricing in one and a half cuts this year due to strong economic data, according to one attendee.\nA spokesperson for the Treasury Department and the White House were not immediately available to comment. The Post has sought comment from Soros.\nBefore being appointed Treasury secretary under Trump, Bessent worked twice at Soros Fund Management, eventually rising to the role of chief investment officer before launching his own hedge fund.\nHe quickly advanced within the firm, eventually becoming the head of SFM\u2019s London office. In that role, Bessent played a pivotal part in executing one of the firm\u2019s most famous trades: the 1992 \u201cBlack Wednesday\u201d bet against the British pound.\nThis trade netted Soros\u2019s fund more than $1 billion and helped establish Bessent\u2019s reputation as a talented macro investor.\nHe is frequently described as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Soros, having learned directly from the financier and made significant contributions to SFM\u2019s investment strategies.\nIn 2015, after leaving Soros Fund Management, Bessent founded his own hedge fund, Key Square Group. He launched the fund with a substantial $2 billion anchor investment from Soros.\nThe financial backing underscored the continued strength of their relationship. Although Soros\u2019s capital remained in the fund for several years, it was eventually withdrawn in 2018 as Key Square diversified its investor base.\nSoros, through his Open Society Foundations, has spent over $32 billion advancing left-wing causes around the world. In the US, he\u2019s backed radical criminal justice reforms, including soft-on-crime prosecutors, bail elimination and drug decriminalization.\nSoros, who at age 94 has largely receded from public life and has handed the reins of his empire to his son, Alex, is one of the Democratic Party\u2019s biggest donors, funneling hundreds of millions into liberal Super PACs and candidates like Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden.\nHe also funded efforts to oppose Trump and other conservatives. In the 2022 midterms alone, Soros was the single largest political donor, contributing over $125 million to left-wing political groups and campaigns.\nBessent has taken on an unusually prominent role for a Treasury chief, serving as the lead negotiator in ongoing trade talks with China, Japan and other Asian countries.\nHe is scheduled to visit Japan next week, although the Treasury Department has stated that trade will not be a topic of discussion.\nMeetings with Chinese officials and Indonesia\u2019s coordinating minister for economic affairs are also expected to take place soon.\nDuring his remarks in Sun Valley, Bessent pushed back against critics who claim Trump often escalates trade conflicts only to back down.\nHe dismissed the label \u201cTACO trade,\u201d a term coined by a Financial Times columnist meaning \u201cTrump Always Chickens Out.\u201d\nInstead, Bessent characterized Trump\u2019s approach as more aggressive and likened it to the acronym \u201cFAFO,\u201d which stands for \u201cF\u2014 Around and Find Out,\u201d a phrase popular on social media."

      "text": "Liberal dark money network has donated $10M to anti-Israel causes\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was revised on Nov. 18, and Nov. 20, 2023.\nOne of the largest left-wing dark money networks has funneled more than $10 million to anti-Israel causes over the past five years, according to records reviewed by The Post, as the embattled Jewish state faces calls for its destruction in demonstrations across the US during its war against Hamas terrorists.\nWashington, DC-based Arabella Advisors contributes to an array of progressive nonprofits through its New Venture Fund, Hopewell Fund, Sixteen Thirty Fund, North Fund, and Windward Fund, which have given a combined $10,833,396 to anti-Israel groups since 2018.\nThose nonprofits have gone on to support radical Palestinian activist groups that have been linked to terrorism and agitated against US support for Israel in the wake of the Oct. 7 terror attack by Hamas jihadists that killed more than 1,400 people \u2014 including at least 33 Americans.\nThe largest share went to NEO Philanthropy, which collected $5,161,465 from four of the five funds since 2018, and runs a project founded by antisemitic activist Linda Sarsour.\nMPower Change, Sarsour\u2019s project, circulated false information from Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry about casualties from a missile that struck a hospital last week \u2014 despite US intelligence and the Israeli military confirming that terrorists fired the rocket.\nThe group also promoted a Democratic Socialists of America-led rally in New York City this month, where protesters displayed antisemitic signs including a Nazi swastika.\nCaitlin Sutherland, the executive director of Americans for Public Trust, which asked the IRS to investigate Arabella Advisors in August, told The Post that the dark money network\u2019s donors \u201cshould be mortified that their money is being routed to organizations leading blatantly antisemitic, pro-terrorist pep rallies.\u201d\n\u201cThe network should immediately ask for their money back from these radical groups, and Arabella\u2019s financial backers should reconsider the cost of supporting a network that is tacitly endorsing an alarming movement of hate aimed at Jewish communities across our country,\u201d Sutherland said.\nAnother activist group, One Arizona, has received $2,327,000 from the New Venture Fund, Hopewell Fund and Windward Fund since 2018, according to tax filings collected by ProPublica.\nThe group sponsors the Arizona Asian American Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander for Equity, which called on followers in an Instagram post \u201cto support Palestine and the fight against western imperialism.\u201d\nDuring Israel\u2019s last conflict with Hamas in May 2021, the Alliance for Youth Action, which has taken $2,200,000 from the Sixteen Thirty Fund since 2018, referred to the rocket attacks launched from Gaza as a \u201cfight for liberation.\u201d\nThe Black Alliance for Just Immigration, which received $400,000 in 2019 and 2020, also said amid the conflict that \u201cIsrael\u2019s occupation\u201d and US support for its \u201cgenocide\u201d against Palestinians was \u201cunconscionable.\u201d\nThe Alliance for Global Justice also took $473,000 from the Windward Fund and New Venture Fund, tax filings from 2020 and 2021 show, even as it sponsored the Israeli-designated terrorist group Samidoun.\nThe Washington Examiner first reported on those terror links last year, prompting Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Paypal to bar Samidoun from their payment processing services.\nThe Alliance for Global Justice has responded to the Hamas attacks by circulating statements from Venezuela\u2019s authoritarian leader Nicolas Maduro against Israel and referring to its military response as a \u201cZionist onslaught.\u201d\nAnother group, Grassroots for Global Justice, has taken $110,000 since 2019 from the Windward Fund, according to tax filings, funneling the money to organizations like the Palestinian Youth Movement, which blamed Israel for Hamas\u2019 atrocities and held rallies in Washington, DC, and New York City.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got tanks; we\u2019ve got hang gliders,\u201d a speaker for the Palestinian Youth Movement said at the protest in the Big Apple, referencing Hamas terrorists who paraglided into an Israeli music festival to massacre 260 civilians.\n\u201cGlory to all the resistance fighters,\u201d the speaker said.\nThe IfNotNow Movement, which has raked in $62,000 since 2020 from the Sixteen Thirty Fund, helped organize protests earlier this month at the White House and US Capitol and has stated that \u201cIsrael\u2019s apartheid system\u201d provoked the terrorist attacks.\nThe New Venture Fund also gave $40,000 to the Arizona chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which shared a template on Instagram to help others denounce school administrators or employers who issue statements \u201cin support of Israel.\u201d\nRep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), who refuses to retract a false statement of her own about the Gaza hospital explosion, will also be the keynote speaker at a CAIR Arizona banquet on Nov. 18.\nOther groups like the Education for Liberation Network and Muslims for Progressive Values, which received roughly $60,000 from the New Venture Fund combined, have taught schoolchildren that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a \u201cstruggle against occupation\u201d and suggested that reports of Hamas raping women and burning Israeli parents and children alive were false.\nArabella Advisors\u2019 network of funds has reported more than $1 billion in total revenue each year since 2020, according to reports on tax filings.\nFounded in 2005 by former Clinton administration official Eric Kessler, the for-profit firm is not required to disclose its donors, though left-wing billionaires George Soros and Pierre Omidyar have volunteered multimillion-dollar contributions to funds in its network, the New York Times has reported.\nArabella maintains that its grants were not used for any purposes related to the current conflict in Israel and that grants provided by Arabella\u2019s nonprofit clients to the referenced organizations were used for projects and purposes that have nothing to do with the Israel-Palestine conflict.\nThe Funds maintain that no funding to NEO Philanthropy has gone to \u201csupport terrorism, antisemitism, or Nazism. Rather, the Funds have provided grants to NEO Philanthropy to support causes such as reproductive rights, public interest technology, criminal justice reform, and census engagement.\u201d\nThe Funds maintain that \u201cthe grants that the Funds have provided to One Arizona have nothing to do with\nsupporting Palestine or fighting against \u2018western imperialism.\u2019 Rather, the funds have been used for projects aimed at civic engagement in the State of Arizona, including, for example, projects intended to help historically marginalized groups become part of the redistricting process in the United States.\nThe Funds maintain that \u201cthe funds that Sixteen Thirty Fund provided to Alliance for Youth Action had nothing to do with Gaza and related to election reforms designed to increase voter turnout in the United States.\u201d\nRegarding the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, the Funds maintain that \u201cmoney was provided by the Funds to this organization for the purpose of promoting outreach and education concerning the 2020 US census.\u201d\nThe Funds maintain that \u201cthe New Venture Fund and the Windward Fund have provided no money to Samidoun and instead provided grants to Alliance for Global Justice for domestic clean energy projects, such as redevelopment of an oil refinery in Philadelphia, and to help young [black] people in Chicago get access to education. Furthermore, the Funds have discontinued grants and will no longer provide future funding to the Alliance for Global Justice.\u201d\nThe Funds maintain that \u201cthe Windward Fund provided no funds to the Palestinian Youth Movement. Rather, the Windward Fund provided a grant to Grassroots for Global Justice specifically for its labor advocacy project, Black Workers for Justice.\u201d\nThe Funds maintain that \u201cthe grant provided by the Sixteen Thirty Fund to the IfNotNow Movement was actually used to pursue strategies to oppose antisemitism.\u201d\nThe Funds maintain that \u201cthe grant provided by the New Venture Fund\u201d to the Council on American-Islamic Relations\u2019 Arizona chapter \u201cwas for improving civic engagement and voting rights in the State of Arizona. It had nothing to do with Israel.\u201d\nRegarding the Education for Liberation Network and Muslims for Progressive Values, the Funds maintain \u201cthe grants provided by the New Venture Fund have nothing to do with teaching children about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or Hamas. Rather, the New Venture Fund grants were used for such causes as nurturing communities of thoughtful and socially-engaged people and social media campaigns in Burundi and Kenya.\u201d\n\u201cWe condemn terrorism and violence against civilians in all forms and do not support any projects or provide any grants to organizations that fund terrorism,\u201d Lee Bodner, president of New Venture Fund, told The Post in a statement.\n\u201cNew Venture Fund is discontinuing grants to any projects hosted by Alliance for Global Justice.\u201d\n\u201cThe Windward Fund is no longer providing grants for organizations that are sponsored by the Alliance for Global Justice,\u201d Lynn McNair, president of the Windward Fund, also told the Post in a statement.\n\u201cOur organization does not support terrorism in any form and strongly denounce any violence against civilians.\u201d"

      "text": "FBI never probed \u2018confidential\u2019 talks between DNC, Clinton campaign and George Soros group, bombshell intel files show\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Two high-ranking employees of liberal billionaire George Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations held \u201cconfidential conversations\u201d with the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign team in 2016 to push the narrative of collusion between Russia and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, newly declassified intelligence files show.\nThe documents revealed that Leonard Benardo and Jeffrey Goldstein \u2014 Open Society\u2019s regional director and senior policy adviser for Eurasia, respectively \u2014 held talks with then-DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in early 2016 about smearing Trump as well as distracting from the \u201cgrowing scandal\u201d surround Clinton\u2019s \u201cpossible corruption\u201d as secretary of state.\nIn a January 2016 memo, the Soros operatives discussed with Wasserman Schultz the negative fallout from Clinton Foundation donors getting preferential access to Hillary and the \u201ctimely deletion of relevant data from mail servers.\u201d\nThe year before, the former secretary of state had nixed more than 30,000 emails from a private server. The FBI confirmed in a subsequent investigation that the messages included \u201cvery sensitive, highly classified information,\u201d but no charges were brought.\nAccording to another memo, this one from March 2016, President Barack Obama didn\u2019t want the controversy to \u201cdarken the final part of his presidency\u201d and apparently tried to pressure his attorney general, Loretta Lynch, to meddle in FBI Director James Comey\u2019s investigation of the Clinton emails.\n\u201cBarack Obama sanctioned the use of all administrative levers to remove possibly negative effects from the FBI investigation of cases related to the Clinton Foundation and the email correspondence in the State Department,\u201d the memo declared.\nAs a result, the DNC saw the scandals\u2019 threat to Clinton\u2019s campaign as \u201cminimal\u201d and worked on developing a two-pronged counter-attack \u201cfocused on discrediting Trump through debates and propaganda activities\u201d \u2014 with the help of \u201cspecial services.\u201d\nThose included either the direct involvement of intelligence agencies or the use of a now-discredited dossier compiled by ex-MI6 spy Christopher Steele, alleging that Russian leader Vladimir Putin had blackmail material on Trump.\nAt the time, the files also disclosed, Lynch was communicating with Clinton campaign political director Amanda Renteria and the Democratic candidate was in the process of discussing a plan with adviser Julianne Smith that Benardo described as \u201ca long-term affair to demonize Putin and Trump.\u201d\n\u201cHRC [Hillary Rodham Clinton] approved Julia\u2019s idea about Trump and Russian hackers hampering U.S. elections,\u201d a bombshell July 27, 2016, email from Benardo said of the plot. \u201cThat should distract people from her own missing emails. \u2026 The point is making the Russian play a U.S. domestic issue.\u201d\nBenardo currently serves as senior vice president at Open Society Foundations.\n\u201cThe claim that the Open Society Foundations helped orchestrate an FBI investigation is an outrageous falsehood,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cIt is grounded in malicious disinformation traced to Russian intelligence and now weaponized as part of a politically motivated campaign to attack our leadership and our work to promote human rights.\n\u201cThe Durham report found no wrongdoing by our staff,\u201d the rep added. \u201cWe are a nonpartisan organization and do not engage in political campaign activity. These accusations are not just reckless, they are dangerous. They reflect a broader effort to foment hostility and undermine civil society\u2014and they are calculated to distract from real scandals.\u201d\nGoldstein\u2019s current status is unclear.\n\u201cThis declassified appendix simply recycles long-debunked claims and false information,\u201d Renteria told The Post in a statement, echoing remarks she had made back in 2017 to the press. \u201cI did not know Loretta Lynch then, and I don\u2019t know her now.\u201d\nThe memos and other intelligence files were handed over to the Obama FBI, and bureau deputy director Andrew McCabe shared them with senior officials at the Department of Justice \u2014 but the information implicating Clinton in the Russiagate scandal was never fully investigated.\nComey later told the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Inspector General he didn\u2019t view the intelligence \u2014 which had been obtained by Russian hackers \u2014 as \u201ccredible.\u201d\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker disagreed and told the DOJ OIG \u201chow personally bothered he was\u201d by Lynch\u2019s interactions with Clinton\u2019s campaign, adding that \u201che and other FBI executives had great concerns\u201d about evidence in the memos implying Lynch would \u201cuse her position to make sure that Hillary Clinton was not prosecuted.\u201d\nSpecial counsel John Durham unearthed the stunning disclosures as part of a multi-year investigation into intelligence efforts surrounding the 2016 election and maintained in his assessment that analysts \u201cwell-versed in Sensitive Intelligence collection\u201d viewed the \u201cBenardo emails were likely authentic.\u201d\n\u201cSome analysts also noted it was possible, however, that the Russians might have fabricated or altered purported U.S. emails,\u201d according to Durham\u2019s annex.\nWhen Durham interviewed Benardo, the Open Society employee said \u201cto the best of his recollection, he did not draft the emails.\u201d The special counsel\u2019s office was \u201cunable to locate\u201d the records at the organization or other think tanks.\n\u201cThe [Clinton] campaign might have wanted or expected the FBI or other agencies to aid that effort (\u2018put more oil into the fire\u2019) by commencing a formal investigation of the DNC hack [by Russia],\u201d Durham\u2019s annex noted.\n\u201cThe Office\u2019s best assessment is that the \u2026 emails that purport to be from Benardo were ultimately a composite of several emails that were obtained through Russian intelligence hacking of the U.S.-based Think Tanks, including the Open Society Foundations, the Carnegie Endowment, and others.\u201d\nThe CIA determined that the intelligence was also not \u201cthe product of Russian fabrications\u201d as early as 2017.\nThe FBI received an investigative referral from the CIA related to the Clinton files after an Aug. 3, 2016, meeting at the White House at which Obama, Comey, then-CIA Director John Brennan, Vice President Joe Biden, and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper were all present.\nThe information implicating Trump was still \u201cdisseminated through leading U.S. publications,\u201d the intelligence files recounted, as part of \u201cthe first stage of the campaign\u201d by Clinton associates \u201cdue to lack of direct evidence\u201d of Trump\u2019s purported collusion with Russia.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, CIA Director John Brennan and FBI Director Kash Patel approved the release of the files Thursday by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).\n\u201cBased on the Durham annex, the Obama FBI failed to adequately review and investigate intelligence reports showing the Clinton campaign may have been ginning up the fake Trump-Russia narrative for Clinton\u2019s political gain, which was ultimately done through the Steele Dossier and other means,\u201d Grassley said in a statement.\n\u201cThese intelligence reports and related records, whether true or false, were buried for years. History will show that the Obama and Biden administration\u2019s law enforcement and intelligence agencies were weaponized against President Trump,\u201d he also said.\n\u201cThis political weaponization has caused critical damage to our institutions and is one of the biggest political scandals and cover-ups in American history. The new Trump administration has a tremendous responsibility to the American people to fix the damage done and do so with maximum speed and transparency.\u201d\nReps for Clinton did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

      "text": "George Soros funneled $37M to Working Families Party, other lefty groups backing Zohran Mamdani\nThat\u2019s rich.\nSocialist Zohran Mamdani has declared billionaires shouldn\u2019t exist, but it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019d be the front-runner to become the Big Apple\u2019s next mayor if it wasn\u2019t for one \u2014 far-left kingmaker George Soros, financial records reviewed by The Post show.\nMamdani recently told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press, \u201cI don\u2019t think that we should have billionaires, frankly\u201d while doubling down on his plan to jack up property taxes on \u201cricher and whiter neighborhoods\u201d if elected mayor.\nBut in less than a decade, Soros\u2019 ultra-woke grant-making network Open Society Foundation has indirectly funneled a combined $37 million to the Working Families Party and at least other nine left-wing groups whose endorsements and get-out-the-vote groundwork played a pivotal role in helping Mamdani upset ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic mayoral primary, the foundation\u2019s records show.\nSince 2016, the far-left, socialist-friendly WFP \u2014 which helped score Mandani the Democratic line by brokering cross-endorsement deals that squeezed out Cuomo \u2014 has pocketed a staggering $23.7 million from Soros through its nonprofit fundraising arm Working Families Organization Inc.\nAnd at least another $13,944,005 went to the nine nonprofits and their offshoot fundraising entities \u2014 including the Make The Road Action ($3,515,00), and social justice nonprofits Community Voices Heard ($2,635,000) and Move On ($2.3 million), and the anti-Zionist group Jewish Voice for Peace Acton ($650,000), according to records.\nAll those groups backed the Queens assemblyman\u2019s mayoral campaign \u2013 as well as his Marxist agenda that includes advocating for criminal migrants and condemning Israel.\n\u201cWhile Zohran Mamdani attacks job creators and rails against wealth, the truth is he\u2019s benefiting from millions in support from billionaires and the very nonprofit network he pretends to stand apart from,\u201d Mayor Eric Adams told The Post.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways. We need leadership that brings people together \u2014 not politicians who demonize success while quietly cashing in on it,\u201d added Adams, a registered Democrat seeking re-election as an independent.\nThe mayor touted he\u2019s a great example of the \u201cAmerican Dream,\u201d considering he was born into poverty 64 years ago in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and now runs the \u201cgreatest city in the world.\u201d\n\u201cThe idea that billionaires or successful people shouldn\u2019t exist isn\u2019t just extreme \u2014 it\u2019s un-American,\u201d Hizzoner added.\nDouglas Kellogg, state projects director for the conservative anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform, said no one should be surprised Soros\u2019 money is quietly driving Mamdani\u2019s campaign.\n\u201cGeorge Soros is like a comic-book villain, James Bond villain who\u2019s funding a movement designed to undermine individual freedom and liberty across the globe,\u201d said Kellogg.\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s been doing it for years, and he\u2019s continues to do it and finds new effective faces to put in front on it. If communism and socialism was popular, he wouldn\u2019t have to spend so much money and take so much time to try to achieve it.\u201d\nKellogg also said he believes there will be a mass Big Apple exodus of \u201cproductive, law-abiding citizens who make New York great\u201d if Mamdani is mayor, \u201cso the taxpayers and businesses have a lot to lose.\u201d\nAlthough Soros and his family didn\u2019t directly donate to Mamdani\u2019s campaign, Patrick Gaspard, a former Open Society Foundations president who is now a distinguished senior fellow for a liberal think tank heavily funded by Soros called Center for American Progress, did play a key role.\nGaspard, a longtime pal of far-left ex-Mayor Bill de Blasio who served as a top aide to former President Barack Obama, quietly helped guide Mamdani throughout the campaign, the New York Times reported.\nThis included Gaspard meeting up with Mamdani and City Comptroller Brad Lander last month at Yara, a Midtown Lebanese restaurant, where over plates of fattoush, hummus and eggplant both mayoral candidates agreed to cross-endorse each other to help defeat Cuomo.\nRepublican mayoral nominee Curtis Sliwa said he believes Mamdani \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to get rid of billionaires. He only wants to destroy the ones who don\u2019t bankroll his radical agenda.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re George Soros or part of the far-left donor class, you get a free pass and a seat at the table,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMamdani will drive out everyone else and turn New York into a city run by untouchables, where the Soros machine calls the shots.\u201d\nBillionaire John Catsimatidis, who owns the Gristedes supermarket chain, said Mamdani should be more transparent about his ties to Soros.\n\u201cI think America is the land of the free, and if it\u2019s billionaires . . . who are providing jobs, what is wrong with that?\u201d said Catsimatidis.\nNew York City is home to more billionaires than any city in the world \u2014 123.\nBoth Mamdani and Catsimatidis have butted heads over the Democratic Socialist\u2019s pie-in-the-sky pledge to establish city-run grocery stores.\nCatsimatidis has threatened to sell his stores if Mamdani is elected mayor, but said this week it\u2019s more likely he\u2019d \u201creduce operations.\u201d\nNeither Soros nor Mamdani returned requests for comment."

      "text": "Lefty groups behind \u2018grassroots\u2019 anti-Trump protests in US propped up by billionaires and dark-money network\nDozens of lefty groups behind the country\u2019s supposedly \u201cgrassroots\u201d May Day protests have been largely bankrolled by two billionaires and a dark-money network of progressive nonprofits.\nMore than $500 million from Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss\u2019 organizations, hedge-fund tycoon George Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations and the dark-money Arabella network flowed to the progressive groups between fiscal years 2016 and 2023, according to an analysis shared with The Post.\nThe funding wasn\u2019t intended for the May Day protests per se, but it has been propping up many of the self-styled \u201cgrassroots\u201d progressive activist groups over time.\n\u201cThe hypocrisy of the May Day protests is glaring,\u201d said Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of Americans for Public Trust, to The Post.\n\u201cThese organizations project the illusion of being driven by everyday Americans, but in reality, they\u2019re being bankrolled by some of the biggest dark-money megadonors in politics.\u201d\nStarting Thursday, on May Day, organizers put together more than 1,000 protests across the country to demonstrate against President Trump, activity that spilled into the weekend.\nAlthough the day is not generally a significant phenomenon in the US, in some countries, it is a holiday to mark International Workers\u2019 Day and spring festivities. Oftentimes, labor movements overseas use it to protest for certain causes.\nThe \u201c50501\u201d movement \u2014 or \u201c50 protests, 50 states, 1\u201d effort, an anti-Trump organization that formed in January \u2014 is widely credited for trying to move that international energy into the US by orchestrating the widespread stateside protests last week.\nUS organizers framed the demonstrations as a fight against \u201cTrump and his billionaire profiteers\u201d \u2014 despite records showing that prominent plutocrats were funding many of the participating activist groups.\nMany of the protests were also directed at tech baron Elon Musk, who is poised to dramatically reduce his cost-cutting role in the Trump administration by the month\u2019s end.\n\u201cTrump and his billionaire profiteers are trying to create a race to the bottom \u2013 on wages, on benefits, on dignity itself,\u201d the \u201c50501\u201d movement said on its website ahead of the demonstrations.\n\u201cWe are demanding a country that puts our families over their fortunes \u2013 public schools over private profits, healthcare over hedge funds, prosperity over free market politics.\u201d\nAbout three dozen of the participating groups have raked in about $293.6 million from Wyss\u2019 groups, $47 million from the Arabella network and $194.2 million from Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations, according to an assessment reviewed and checked by The Post.\nSome of the most prominent left-wing activist groups in the anti-Trump demonstrations last week were the Sunrise Movement, Indivisible and Planned Parenthood.\nTax filings and other records show that the Sunrise Movement took in $2,070,000 from funders in the so-called Arabella network, and Indivisible got $107,000 from the Arabella network, $6.5 million from Wyss groups and $7.6 million from Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations, while Planned Parenthood Federation of America accrued $1.6 million from the Arabella network, almost $6 million from Wyss\u2019 groups and $19.7 million from Soros\u2019 group.\n\u201cThe Open Society Foundations did not fund or coordinate the May Day protests,\u201d a rep for the Open Society Foundations told The Post.\n\u201cWe support a wide range of organizations committed to justice and democratic participation, but how they choose to engage in political moments is up to them.\u201d\nAn Arabella representative said, \u201cArabella Advisors has no connection to the May Day protests.\n\u201cWe are a nonpartisan professional services firm that provides operational and administrative support to philanthropists and nonprofit organizations.\u201d\nThe Arabella network data includes IRS Form 990 information for the Sixteen Thirty Fund, North Fund, New Venture Fund and Hopewell Fund \u2014 nonprofit groups that the Washington, DC-based Arabella Advisors services with operational and administrative support.\nWyss\u2019 groups include activities from the eponymous Wyss Foundation \u2014 his charitable group \u2014 and the Berger Action Fund, his advocacy arm. The Wyss Foundation has not donated to any of the organizations in question.\nBecause of his Swiss citizenship, Wyss, 89, is precluded from donating to US political candidates. But he has emerged as a top backer of lefty causes in America nonetheless, by pumping cash into dark-money groups.\nDark money in these cases refers to political spending that is not subject to financial disclosure requirements, which helps shield donor identities.\nWyss made his fortune from the medical-device-maker company Synthes, which he sold more than a decade ago to Johnson & Johnson.\nOne of the largest groups to partake in protests that benefited from Wyss was Families Over Billionaires, the trade name for the massive liberal dark-money Sixteen Thirty Fund, which received more than $278 million from his organizations, records show.\nThe May Day demonstrations across the US were the latest in anti-Trump protests that have taken place since his 2024 election victory, which have been orchestrated by groups that have, in part, received billionaire cash."

      "text": "Trump takes control of DC police, deploying National Guard in historic capital crime crackdown \u2014 and warns NYC could be next\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump announced a sweeping crime crackdown in DC on Monday, placing the city\u2019s police department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to patrol the streets \u2014 while warning New York City could be next.\n\u201cI\u2019m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor \u2014 and worse. This is liberation day in DC and we\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\u201cOur capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore. We\u2019re not going to take it.\u201d\nTrump vowed to \u201cclean it up real quick,\u201d \u201clike we did on the southern border\u201d with illegal immigration.\nThe Home Rule Act, which granted DC self-governance in 1973, allows the president to assert emergency control of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) for 30 days. Congress can pass a joint resolution extending his control, which would require a bare majority in the Republican-held House and Senate.\nDocuments formalizing the takeover were transmitted to Congress Monday afternoon and DC police officials set up a meeting later in the day with White House officials to discuss the new arrangement.\nTerry Cole, the Senate-confirmed administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, will temporarily lead the 3,400-officer MPD under the supervision of Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump said.\nIt was not immediately clear how the National Guard deployment will proceed \u2014 including numbers and neighborhoods where they will be sent \u2014 but members of that force historically assist law enforcement in a supporting role and do not have the ability to make arrests.\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in an interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d Monday night, said Guardsmen from DC and \u201cother states\u201d would be deployed to the district \u201cthis week and in coming weeks\u201d to act as \u201cforce multipliers\u201d for local and federal law enforcement.\n\u201cThey will be standing right alongside our federal agents, like they were in Los Angeles. They\u2019re going to be proactive. If you take an action or a shot at them, there will be a consequence,\u201d Hegseth told host Laura Ingraham.\nThe Pentagon chief added that the troops will be allowed to \u201cinterdict\u201d and \u201ctemporarily detain\u201d individuals if they see a crime in progress and local law enforcement isn\u2019t nearby, \u201clike we did in Los Angeles.\u201d\nHegseth didn\u2019t say how many National Guard members would be activated in DC, or how long they would be patrolling the streets, describing the length of their mission as \u201cconditions-based.\u201d\nJustifying his action Monday morning, the president displayed a chart showing that DC has more murders per capita than the capital cities of cocaine-exporting Columbia, cartel-plagued Mexico, and terrorist hub Iraq.\n\u201cWe doubled up on Baghdad,\u201d Trump commented.\n\u201cYou people are victims of it too. You are reporters and I understand a lot of you tend to be on the liberal side. But you don\u2019t want to get mugged and raped and shot and killed. And you all know people, friends of yours, where that\u2019s happened.\u201d\nTrump cited many high-profile recent crimes in the capital, including the Aug. 3 attack on former Department of Government Efficiency staffer Edward Coristine, 19, during an alleged attempted carjacking and the June 30 murder of congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, 21, in a drive-by shooting.\nTrump also mentioned the 2023 carjacking of Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), the near-fatal stabbing of an aide to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) the same year by a \u201cdemented lunatic\u201d and the shooting death of a three-year girl in July.\nThe president described criminals lawlessly cruising about town on unauthorized ATVs and motorbikes and said he planned to beautify the District by fixing road medians, broken marble and potholes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of the slums too\u2026I know it\u2019s not politically correct,\u201d Trump said, teasing apparent plans to get rid of public housing in high-property-value DC.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of the slums where they live.\u201d\nHomeless encampments will also be removed from all public places, including in parks and underpasses, the president vowed, while the US Park Police \u2014 under the control of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum \u2014 will be responsible for the removal of graffiti.\nDC officials say they won\u2019t resist\nDistrict Mayor Muriel Bowser, an elected Democrat, confirmed Monday afternoon that she would comply with the federal takeover.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to work every day to make sure it\u2019s not a complete disaster, let me put it that way,\u201d Bowser said at her own press conference, at which she called Trump\u2019s move \u201cunsettling and unprecedented.\u201d\n\u201cThe main point is this: Everybody should follow the law, the police and the community. And that\u2019s the case now, it was the case last week and it was the case the week before,\u201d she said.\nThe mayor added that she was particularly concerned about making sure that \u201call law enforcement be identifiable by uniform, a badge, a jacket, so that people know that they are law enforcement.\u201d\nTrump first ordered federal officials, including members of the FBI, DEA and Border Patrol, onto the streets of DC the night of Aug. 7-8. Photos circulating on social media and in the press showed those agents wearing clearly identifying uniforms.\nMPD Chief Pamela Smith confirmed she had a meeting set for later Monday with two federal officials, whom she did not name, about next steps.\nSmith added she was interested in receiving help to enforce outstanding warrants for criminal suspects, saying there are \u201cthings that the federal government is also very useful for.\u201d\n\u201cThis will be an opportunity for us to come together and collaborate on being able to go out and execute warrants,\u201d the police chief said.\nAhead of Trump\u2019s announcement, Bowser told MSNBC on Sunday that \u201cwe do need the federal government\u2019s help\u201d and specifically requested assistance rebuilding the city jail.\nBowser recently invoked curfews in parts of the city in a bid to keep teens off the street as early as 7 p.m., but also has claimed crime rates are going down in the city, pointing to official data.\nTrump claimed Monday that the numbers were \u201cphony\u201d and promised that Bondi will be \u201clooking into that.\u201d\nThe president noted that DC police commander Michael Pulliam, whose district included the densely populated Adams Morgan and Columbia Heights neighborhoods, was suspended last month for allegedly falsifying crime data to make trends appear more positive.\nPulliam\u2019s police union defended him and accused MPD leadership of ordering subordinates to falsify violent crime data.\nDC Police Union chairman Gregg Pemberton endorsed Trump\u2019s takeover, saying in a Fox News interview: \u201cWe completely agree with the president that crime in the District of Columbia is out of control and something needs to be done with it.\u201d\nNew York, Chicago, LA in crosshairs\nTrump announced at his press conference that other cities may be next, saying at one point that \u201cI\u2019m going to look at New York in a little while\u201d \u2014 and also name-checking Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\u201cYou look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities that are very bad. New York has a problem,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting very strongly with DC, and we\u2019re going to clean it up real quick, very quickly as they say.\u201d\nTrump additionally announced plans for federal legislation that would override state laws barring judges from applying cash bail requirements to criminal defendants.\nIf necessary, Trump added, ordinary military members could be deployed to join the National Guard and the local cops.\nThe president has direct control over DC\u2019s National Guard, unlike every other unit, which is under the authority of state governors.\n\u201cWashington, DC, should be one of the safest, cleanest and most beautiful cities anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump summed up his plans, \u201cand we\u2019re going to make it that.\u201d"

The protests, organized by Free DC, oppose Trump's plans to federalize the police and deploy the National Guard in response to rising crime rates. Critics argue that these protests are hypocritical, as they are backed by significant dark money from wealthy donors, while Trump claims his actions are necessary to restore safety in the capital.",
