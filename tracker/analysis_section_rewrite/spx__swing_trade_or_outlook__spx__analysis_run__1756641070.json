      "feedback": "The draft meets the 4‑line “Up/Down” format, but the swing‑trade line needs tightening: remove the citation from the probability field (probability must be a plain %), keep the confidence as a plain 0‑100 number, and consider merging the two invalidations into a single clause (“Fed rate hike (OGK8WLL69) or Tesla verdict upheld (LJZYDXVL3)”) to avoid ambiguity. Also ensure the swing‑trade line explicitly references the SPX (or SPX futures) in the entry/stop/target fields (the citations already imply this, but a brief “SPX” label would reinforce the asset). Finally, double‑check that all driver/trigger citations are valid IDs and that no extra text drifts outside the required fields.",
