      "summary": "OPEC lifted output by 400,000 barrels per day in August to 28.55 mbpd, largely driven by Saudi Arabia's 230,000‑bpd increase. The boost has only modestly eased price pressure on Brent, which is trading near $68 a barrel after a 9% YTD decline. The IEA warns that the surge could trigger a major surplus in coming months, while Saudi faces a budget deficit and U.S. shale producers feel the pain.",
