  "description": "The identity of the 15-year-old boy who killed Harvey Willgoose is protected due to his age.",
  "content": "The parents of a schoolboy who was murdered by a fellow pupil on his lunchbreak have called for an order protecting the identity of his 15-year-old killer to be lifted. Harvey Willgoose, who was also 15, died when he was stabbed in the heart with a hunting knife at All Saints Catholic High School in Sheffield on 3 February. Harvey's killer cannot be named because of his age. However, the BBC and other media have applied to have the anonymity order protecting his identity lifted. Harvey's mum Caroline said her son's name had been \"tarnished\" throughout the trial, adding: \"He hasn't been able to speak up for himself and he's been named. The defendant should be as well.\"\n\nThe trial judge, Mrs Justice Ellenbogen, is expected to make a decision on whether to lift the order when the 15-year-old is sentenced in October. Harvey's parents, who have set up a youth club in his memory, reiterated their earlier call to install knife arches in schools. \"Get knife arches in, then get educating children about the pure devastation that knife crime brings,\" said Mrs Willgoose. \"Children know there are knives in schools. Something needs to be done.\" Mrs Willgoose, who has campaigned against knife crime since her son's death, added: \"If you don't think there's a problem, ask your child if they have ever known of anybody bringing a knife into school. \"I think parents would be very interested in their answer.\" Harvey's dad Mark said the family had previously had met with Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to discuss the issue.",

      "text": "Snapchat row and a hidden knife: The final hours before Harvey Willgoose's murder\n- Published\nWhen Harvey Willgoose left for school on 3 February, neither he, nor those who knew and loved him, had any idea he would not return home again.\nThis is the story of Harvey's final hours, as told to the BBC and the jury, who have convicted his 15-year-old schoolmate of murder.\n\"I followed him to the door, and he said, 'shut the door behind me - I love you',\" Caroline Willgoose recalls.\nThose eight words were the final ones Harvey would speak to his mum.\nEarlier in the morning, as he got ready to go to All Saints Catholic High School in Sheffield, he had asked his mum if she was proud of him.\n\"I am, love,\" came the reply.\nFor about a year, Harvey had regularly missed school. There were a number of reasons, including anxiety, but more recently a concern about weapons at the site.\nThe week before his murder, there had been a lockdown at the 1,400-pupil school following a fight between a friend of Harvey's and a friend of his soon-to-be killer.\nThe defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had insisted Harvey's friend had a knife on him, but police never found one.\nHarvey had not been in school that day.\nTwo days later, on the Friday before he was killed, Harvey had messaged his dad: \"Am not going in that school while people have knives.\"\nThe following week, he summoned the courage to return - and was fatally stabbed in the chest by another pupil.\nDuring a month-long trial at Sheffield Crown Court, his killer admitted manslaughter, but denied murder, arguing he had suffered a \"loss of control\" - saying his memory of what happened stopped \"just before I stabbed him\".\nOn Monday 3 February, as pupils across Sheffield prepared for a normal school day, Harvey's killer searched online for a prayer to keep him safe and tucked a hunting knife into his coat pocket.\nHe described it as a \"scary knife\" which he only kept for protection: \"If someone tried to attack me and I pulled it out, they're not going to want to fight me,\" he later told the jury.\nHarvey and the defendant were in separate social groups at school, but were generally on good terms - at least until a \"non-stop\" argument had erupted on Snapchat the weekend after the fight between their friends.\nIn the early hours of Saturday morning, Harvey - whose mum said \"loved his friends like he loved his family\" - posted his address on the chat.\nHe tagged the defendant's friend, and said: \"If you've got a problem with [my friends] - any of them - you've got my addy [address], I'll deal with it, simple.\"\nBefore school on Monday, Harvey opened Snapchat again to try and clear the air.\nThis time, he messaged the defendant directly, asking if there was \"beef\" - or tension - between them. The defendant responded, \"nah but if u wan beef we can hav it\".\nThen, in an otherwise typical teenage, slang-filled, message, his tone changed, telling Harvey he had been his first friend at the school.\nAt about 09:15 that morning, Harvey passed the teenager, who was sitting at a desk in an empty school corridor. Harvey pointed at him and called him a name in fun, the defendant said.\nHarvey then had asked what had happened to his injured hand, and joked about his poor boxing skills.\nThe teenager pushed Harvey a few times, and they appeared to be sparring. It was light-hearted, he said, and they parted with a handshake.\nHe told the jury: \"I was thinking it was all right between me and him.\"\nThen, in a foreshadowing of the police statement he would make the following day, the boy went back to the account he had been asked to write about the previous week's fight.\nHe had been physically restrained from getting involved in the altercation, but, unlike the other boys involved, he had not been suspended.\nSoon after, Harvey ran into teacher Claire Staniforth, who was head of Year 10 at the time. He asked if she was pleased to see him, and she said yes.\n\"He said he hadn't been planning to [attend], because he heard there had been a knife. I said I wouldn't have been in work if someone had a knife,\" Ms Staniforth told the jury.\nHarvey, in a mock show of toughness held his hands up and added: \"As if anyone's going to stab me.\"\nAt about 10:55, in morning break, he and the defendant met in the same corridor as before.\nNow much busier, they pushed into each other again, but the boy later claimed to the court Harvey had threatened to \"juck\" - or stab - him.\nThe defendant did not mention this skirmish to Ms Staniforth when, 15 minutes later, he went to her office to ask to be excused from his science lesson in order to avoid two other students.\nHe had already been allowed to miss PE earlier - to avoid the boy he claimed had brought the knife the week before - so was told to attend science as normal.\n'Squared up'\nHarvey arrived to the lesson late, but in a \"good mood\", said teacher Sophie Heath-Whyte.\n\"We had a bit of a joke,\" she told the jury. \"My arm was in a sling at the time [and] he was joking, saying I had been in a fight.\"\nBut when the defendant walked in, Harvey asked for a time-out. As the boys crossed paths in the narrow gap between desks, they \"squared up\".\nThe teacher said they were baiting each other, with the defendant admitting he taunted Harvey in an effort to get him to lose his cool.\n\"If he hits me first, I've got a reason to hit him back,\" he said in court.\nHe would later insist he had not wanted to hit Harvey, and had \"worded it out wrong\".\nThe jury heard the defendant had been physically and emotionally abused at home, and had a long history of being bullied. There were reports of him being malnourished.\n\"I remember feeling sorry for him,\" said Ms Heath-Whyte said, recalling he had seemed quiet and sad after the tussle with Harvey.\nHe stayed in the lesson, keeping his coat on despite being asked to remove it \u2013 the knife still in his pocket.\nHarvey visited Ms Staniforth briefly, complaining that the boy had pushed him, then went to the isolation room for some quiet time.\nAt 12:05, five minutes before lunch, Harvey spoke to Ms Staniforth again via the phone in the isolation room.\n\"Hi bestie,\" he said. The teacher asked if he was getting any food, and said he could spend his lunch break in her office. However, \"he never arrived\".\nThe teacher told the court that she and Harvey would make each other laugh. He was a boy who could sometimes be cheeky but \"would never overstep boundaries\".\nAt the start of the lunch break, Harvey told one pupil the defendant had motioned taking something from his pocket in science class. Harvey had thought he was bluffing.\nMeanwhile, the defendant was speaking to one of his friends about Harvey.\n\"He suddenly just talked about a knife,\" the friend told police.\n\"I told him, 'give it to me before you do something stupid', but he didn't listen.\"\nAt 12:15, in the school courtyard, Harvey was said to have met the defendant for the final time.\nThe defendant claimed Harvey had threatened him before placing his hand on his arm.\nThe jury was told that, thinking he was about to be stabbed, the boy pulled the 13cm-long black blade from his pocket.\nAt that point, he claimed, his memory failed.\nCCTV footage played in court showed him pass the knife to his right hand and stab Harvey in the heart with such force he severed one of his ribs.\nFor 49 seconds, Harvey stayed on his feet. Fatally injured, he then backed away across the courtyard, in shock, before moving back towards his attacker.\nThe knife-wielding teen advanced, shouting \"come on! What now?\" according to witnesses, and Harvey moved away.\nOne girl, standing just feet away, told the jury she grabbed a younger girl and ran, saying, \"he's got a knife, he's just stabbed somebody!\".\nHarvey leant into the nearby cafeteria, looked at his attacker for a final time, then stepped back into the courtyard, looked down at his chest and collapsed to the floor.\nFor a moment, he lay alone.\nMs Staniforth heard shouting and ran towards the courtyard: \"I told him I was there,\" she told the jury, through tears.\nMorgan Davis, assistant head, told the court he saw people huddled around Harvey as he headed towards the cafeteria - and the culprit.\n\"I said, 'just give me the knife'.\"\nMr Davis told the court the defendant looked scared and in shock: \"He just kept repeating, 'you know I can't control it'.\"\nHe did not resist the teacher as he took the knife from him, the court heard.\nThe ambulance was called at 12:17 GMT. For seven long minutes, a teacher tried to help Harvey before paramedics arrived.\nMeanwhile, head teacher Sean Pender escorted the defendant to his office.\nMr Pender testified that the attacker said he had stabbed Harvey \"once or twice\", and added: \"I'm not right in the head. My mum doesn't look after me right. I've stabbed him.\"\nAt trial, the boy claimed he did not remember the stabbing, describing himself as lost \"in the moment\".\nHe was arrested in the head teacher's office.\nMeanwhile, police arrived at Harvey's home and took his mum to Sheffield Children's Hospital.\nMrs Willgoose told the BBC how on the way there, a voice on the officer's walkie talkie said: \"Turn the blue lights off, go at normal speed.\"\n\"We got there, and someone had put 'RIP Harvey' [online],\" she said.\n\"We were told he had passed away. I just started screaming.\"\nHarvey was pronounced dead at 13:24.\nMrs Willgoose and some of Harvey's pals told the BBC how friends and family were key to him.\nOne teenager, who had known Harvey since they were six, said he thought about him on a daily basis: \"Every time I needed somewhere to go or someone to see, even at half three in morning, he would always be there no matter what.\"\n\"He weren't a friend, he was more family,\" he added.\nHarvey's mum spoke about how her son brought life to their home: \"The house was always really busy, his friends were always there.\n\"He liked to be at home so our house was always full of kids. Now it's quiet...\"\nShe said her son's killer had \"ruined his life, and Harvey hasn't got a life anymore,\" adding there were now two families \"with an empty bedroom\".\n\"There are no winners here.\"\nGet in touch\nTell us which stories we should cover in Yorkshire\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North\nRelated topics\n- Published3 days ago\n- Published30 July\n- Published18 July\n- Published8 July\n- Published9 July\n- Published4 July\n- Published17 July"

      "text": "Boy, 15, found guilty of murdering fellow pupil\n- Published\nA 15-year-old boy has been found guilty of murdering a fellow pupil he stabbed at a school in Sheffield during their lunch break.\nHarvey Willgoose, who was also 15, died when he was stabbed in the heart with a hunting knife at All Saints Catholic High School on Monday 3 February.\nThe jury in a month-long trial at Sheffield Crown Court was told that Harvey was attacked following a confrontation between the pair during a lesson earlier that day.\nThe defendant, who cannot be named due to his age, had admitted manslaughter and possession of a knife but had denied murdering the teenager. He was found guilty by a majority verdict of 11 to one.\nFollowing the verdict, members of Harvey's family were heard shouting \"yes\" from the public gallery, followed by tears.\nThe judge, Mrs Justice Ellenbogen, told the boy he would likely be sentenced in October.\nJurors heard Harvey had been attacked in the school's courtyard after the two teenagers had quarrelled over social media in the days beforehand.\nThey had taken opposite sides in a separate conflict between two other pupils, which led to the school being briefly locked down on 29 January.\nDuring the trial, the jury was played CCTV from the day of the stabbing, which showed the defendant approach Harvey in the courtyard shortly after midday.\nThe pair stood for a moment, appearing to talk, before the boy pulled out a knife and stabbed Harvey in the chest, severing a rib in the process.\nOne girl who gave evidence in the trial said: \"People were running, screaming everywhere. It was, like, chaos.\"\nAnother pupil said some students had locked themselves in a cupboard and barricaded the door.\nThe defendant told jurors he had not intended to kill Harvey or cause him serious harm and when asked about the attack claimed he could not remember what had happened only that he had \"snapped\" and \"lost control\" of his actions.\nHe told the court he had been bullied and could \"get angry quickly\", saying he had experienced racist abuse and taunts on social media about a medical condition.\nHe said he had also been neglected and suffered physical and emotional abuse at home.\nBut prosecutors said he had \"wanted to show he was hard\" and \"knew exactly what he was doing\", saying he had an \"unhealthy interest in weapons\" and had looked up \"zombie killer knife\" and other blades online.\nThe jury heard the defendant had previously taken pictures of himself with weapons, including a knife and axe, to warn people to stay away.\nSpeaking outside the court following the verdict, Harvey's sister, Sophie, said he had a \"unique ability to bring people together\".\n\"He was deeply loved by his family, cherished by his friends, and respected by all who knew him,\" she said.\n\"Many have been traumatised. Some witnessed the unthinkable and others held Harvey as he took his last breath. To them, we send out deepest love and strength.\"\nShe added that the family would continue campaigning against knife crime for a safer future, \"not just for our children, but for all\".\n\"This tragedy has not only devastated our family, but has rippled across the country. People everywhere continue to grieve the loss of our beautiful boy,\" she said.\nSteve Davies, chief executive of St Clare Catholic Multi Academy Trust which runs the school, said a number of investigations would take place following the trial.\nHe said: \"Harvey's death was an unimaginable tragedy for all, and one that understandably gives rise to a number of questions from his family and others.\n\"We will engage fully and openly with them to help ensure every angle is considered and no key questions are left unresolved.\"\nLouise Haigh, MP for Sheffield Heeley, said an independent review would be held into the circumstances that led to Harvey's death, adding it was \"absolutely essential that all questions are answered\".\nMuch of the trial centred on the defendant's perceived fear about other teenagers carrying knives.\nThe court heard the school had been put into lockdown in the week before Harvey's murder after a fight between two other students led the defendant to raise the alarm.\nHe said one of the pupils involved in the fight was armed, although no weapon was found.\nThe jury heard it was this incident, and an argument over Snapchat, which led to him arming himself the following week.\nHe claimed he had no intention of hurting anyone, telling the jury instead he hoped that if he \"pulled it out, somebody wouldn't try to pull out theirs\".\nAppealing directly to teenagers who carry weapons, Rachel Baldwin, from the Crown Prosecution Service, asked them to \"stop putting lives in danger\".\n\"There can be horrendous and serious consequences,\" she said.\n\"You are putting yourself, other people and your future at risk.\"\nDet Insp Joe Hackworthy, one of the lead investigators in the case, said the boy's decision led to him \"tearing the lives of two families apart\".\n\"Tonight, one boy's family will be spending another night grieving the unimaginable loss of their beloved son, while another boy's family will be living with the reality that their son faces a life sentence behind bars for murder,\" he added.\n\"Our thoughts today are with all those who knew and loved Harvey.\"\nSouth Yorkshire's Mayor, Oliver Coppard, described Harvey as a \"young man full of potential\".\nHe thanked the police and legal teams for their professionalism in securing a verdict and bringing the \"particularly harrowing\" case to a close.\n\"My thoughts, as always, remain with his family \u2013 particularly [his parents] Caroline and Mark, whose strength, courage and dignity has been remarkable,\" Coppard added.\n\"South Yorkshire stands with them.\"\nGet in touch\nTell us which stories we should cover in Yorkshire\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.\nRelated topics\n- Published30 July\n- Published18 July\n- Published9 July"
