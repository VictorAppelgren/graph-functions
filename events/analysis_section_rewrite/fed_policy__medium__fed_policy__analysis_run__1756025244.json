      "feedback": "This draft overreaches on structure and specificity. Actionable edits to lift it toward world-class quality: reframe into a tight 3–4 slide-style scenario map scoped to 3–6 months, with explicit windows, triggers, and invalidations; anchor every claim to a data point from the three sources (SK994CBWR, Q7VVGNSQE, C22MKA9VY) and cite each data point inline; quantify the base/alternate paths using concrete numbers (base-case target near the consensus $34.76 from SK994CBWR; current price ~$30.53; Q2 results at rev $215m, net income $30m, 2025 revenue guide $850–$950m; gross margin 49.4%, net margin ~13.8%; IPOs up to 95 this year raising $12.9b; Russell 2000 valuation gap vs S&P at multi-year lows); specify timing windows (e.g., 0–2 months: policy rhetoric driving risk appetite; 2–4 months: IPO cadence & WFE capex signals; 4–6 months: product ramp impact on margins). Build a causal chain: policy easing and macro risk tolerance lift small-cap rotation (Q7VVGNSQE) which, if sustained, compresses discount rates and drives ACMR multiple expansion; tie ACMR-specific catalysts to this flow (Q2 2025 print reaffirming $850–$950m; Ultra C wb with N2 bubbling tech upgrade; margin resiliency; manageable leverage). For catalysts/triggers/invalidation: list precise triggers (a) a 50bp cut as early as Sept with a path to ~150bp total cuts; (b) IPO cadence continuing beyond 95 deals to support small-cap quality signals; (c) ACMR delivering another positive product ramp/update and maintaining guidance; (d) no escalation in U.S.–China export controls; and invalidate if (i) rate-cut timing disappoints or policy reverses, (ii) ACMR misses revenue/guidance or faces material margin decline, or (iii) export controls bite semiconductor capex; include explicit watch-list signals and thresholds (e.g., ACMR breaking above/below the $32–$33 zone on strong volume; sustained upside revisions; rate-cut timing shifts). Strengthen valuation framing with a clear base-case IRR/price-path via the consensus target (34.76) and a sensitivity note showing how earlier/later rate cuts shift ACMR’s multiple; explicitly reconcile the conflicting narrative in Q7VVGNSQE about IPO-led quality upgrades vs persistent small-cap skepticism by treating it as a regime-translation risk rather than a certainty. Finally, tighten governance: ensure every factual claim is tied to one of the IDs above, avoid duplicative restatements, and end with a concise, testable 3–6 month conclusion and 1–2 alternate contingencies, plus a short confidence qualifier (moderate-to-high but with geopolitical/policy tail risk).",
