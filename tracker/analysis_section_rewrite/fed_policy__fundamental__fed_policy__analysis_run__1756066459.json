      "feedback": "The draft has a solid cross‑asset throughline but it lacks a formal, multi‑year regime framework and explicit first‑principles anchors, which keeps it from yielding world‑class clarity on structural drivers. Actionable edits: (1) Add a dedicated anchors section that names invariant drivers (e.g., real rate differentials implied by the Fed reaction function to inflation and employment; productivity/product mix shifts; terms of trade and external balance implications; policy reaction functions) and state how these would anchor discount rates, risk premia, and dollar/equity pricing across regimes. (2) Build a regime map with clear transition conditions: Regime 1 “anchored disinflation with conditional easing” vs Regime 2 “sticky inflation/hawkish posture” vs Regime 3 “growth slowdown deepening.” Define triggers (e.g., wage growth pace, inflation stickiness, Jackson Hole guidance, semiconductor/capex policy delivery) and tie each regime to distinct market pricing signals (multiples, credit/risk premia, dollar strength). (3) Strengthen the causal chain from policy signals to market pricing: Fed tilt (hawkish/dovish) → discount rates and equity risk premia → sector earnings risk/quality signals → price outcomes for autos, AI/tech, and defensives; show how that chain would re‑rate Ford, Disney/ESPN, Donegal, and semis under each regime. (4) Quantify with concrete numbers drawn from sources: integrate Ford data (17% YTD in 2025; Q2 adjusted op margin 4.3%; ROIC 10.1%; EV‑loss $1.3B in Q2; long‑run revenue CAGR ~2.5%), Disney/ESPN streaming launch (price ≈ $30/mo; cadence of live events), WH Smith drop on an accounting error (~40% pre‑market), and Donegal’s declining dividend yield since 2020; avoid vague statements and present ranges where a single figure isn’t given. (5) Build a base case plus alternate paths, with explicit catalysts and invalidation rules: base case (inflation gradually moderates, conditional easing later 2025–26); upside if policy translates into scalable capex (Intel/chips act) and AI leadership; downside if hawkish surprises or data disappoints persist. Include “what to watch” bullets: Jackson Hole communications, pace of wage growth, semiconductor policy delivery, Ford’s EV profitability trajectory, Disney’s monetization of streaming, and Donegal’s dividend viability. (6) Align citations tightly: attach each claim to the corresponding IDs (24–37UZC9X8I, H7Q52FKDH, 22PL3Q360, TN66GHPAT) and explicitly reconcile any soft points (e.g., macro volatility vs. idiosyncratic shocks like WH Smith accounting) in a brief reconciliation line. (7) Improve readability and format within the constraints by truncating redundant phrases and ensuring every paragraph links a regime, transmission channel, and price implication for at least one core asset. This will deliver a coherent, testable, and defensible multi‑year view that satisfies the horizon focus, with sharper math/metrics, regime clarity, and stronger sourcing discipline.",
