      "feedback": "The current draft overstretches a single 0–3 week thesis across too many threads without a crisp, testable causal chain or explicit trigger levels; to reach world‑class quality you should (1) pose a tight, testable base case with explicit, near‑term catalysts and thresholds, (2) marshal a clear transmission map from policy/news to prices/growth to risk assets, (3) build a compact, source‑driven scenario tree with explicit triggers, invalidation points, and measurable indicators, (4) quantify where possible using numbers in the sources rather than qualitative claims, and (5) tighten sourcing discipline so every assertion is anchored to the IDs you’ve got and reconciled where sources conflict. Specifically: adopt a 0–3 week thesis such as: policy risk from Trump‑era tariff/deportation agendas creates an inflationary drag and growth headwind in the very near term, but a surge in AI capex (as evidenced by the White House list of investments and private sector promises—Apple $600B; NVIDIA/TSMC/Softbank/OpenAI scale; etc.) provides a growth‑support channel that can limit downside unless tariffs worsen; central‑bank independence dynamics (Lagarde’s warning on political interference, Powell’s rate path) set the credibility backdrop for rate expectations and spillovers. Tie these to concrete levels and triggers: tariff news or immigration policy announcements that lift breakevens and tilt equities to risk‑off; the Intel 10% stake for $8.7B interpreted as a move toward industrial policy and a catalyst for sector rotation; ECB/US rate commentary that shifts risk premia; and regulatory/cost pressures (energy/regulatory costs) that could re‑price inflation if sustained. Build a two‑ or three‑scenario framework (base, upside, downside) with explicit invalidation: base if AI capex remains robust and tariffs stabilize, markets drift modestly higher; upside if tariff shocks are defused and AI investment keeps adding productivity; downside if AI momentum falters, tariff uncertainty intensifies, or central banks lose credibility and yields spike. Quantify where possible: cite the Intel stake size (10% for $8.7B) and the magnitude of listed investments (Apple $600B; NVIDIA/TSMC/OpenAI‑led $500B+; other large multi‑billion commitments in the White House list) and drag estimates from Lagarde (central‑bank independence) and LLN6N4H3Z (regulatory cost pressures; energy/climate rules). Also acknowledge competing views: Krugman’s stagflation warning versus Cuban’s rationalization of what keeps inflation “not up” and contrast with the WSJ critique of state‑led stakes; reconcile these by treating them as conditional signals rather than a single narrative. Increase citation density by annotating each assertion to its best‑fit ID (218AGGUXB for Krugman/Cuban AI/ tariffs; U6HXAJR4J for Lagarde; LLN6N4H3Z for energy/regulatory costs; CDBMWIUTB for auto/financing context) and explicitly flag any conflicts (e.g., inflation risk vs AI‑driven disinflation) as separate sub‑sections. Finally, in the “what to monitor next” section, replace broad statements with a crisp checklist: fresh tariff/immigration policy headlines; Intel/industrial‑policy signals; central‑bank communications (Powell/Lagarde) and market reaction; AI capex announcements and quarterly data on inventories and supply chain constraints; and a one‑paragraph invalidation line if AI momentum or policy credibility shifts decisively, plus a numeric sensitivity note (e.g., if breakevens rise by X bps on tariff news, expect Y% downside in equities over the next week). This will yield a tightly argued, numerically anchored, source‑reconciled, 0–3 week framework. Actionable edits: rewrite into a compact thesis with a single causal chain, insert discrete trigger levels and data points, fold all numbers from the investment list with precise references, separate competing narratives as alternative pathways, and add a short monitoring table with the exact sources beside each line. (Citations to anchor: 218AGGUXB; U6HXAJR4J; LLN6N4H3Z; CDBMWIUTB; and the White House investment list in source 3.)",
