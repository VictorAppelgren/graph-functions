Sources with knowledge of the matter say that funding will help Vantage Data Centers\u2019 plan to build a massive new campus.\n\nMeta, meanwhile, is getting $29 billion from Pacific Investment Management and Blue Owl Capital for another gargantuan data center in rural Louisiana. More of these deals are expected, the report added, as OpenAI projects it will ultimately need trillions of dollars to develop the proper AI infrastructure.\n\nThis is all happening at a time when fears of an AI bubble are driving down tech stocks, with companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Nvidia also seeing declines last week.\n\n\u201cPundits pointed to two culprits: Comments by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman that AI could be in a bubble, and a report from MIT saying that 95% of companies it studied are getting \u201czero return\u201d from generative AI,\u201d PYMNTS wrote Friday (Aug. 22).\n\nAltman had said he sees parallels between today\u2019s scramble among investors to ride the AI wave, and the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. Speaking about startup valuations during an interview, the CEO said \u201csomeone\u2019s gonna get burned there.\u201d\n\nThe situation has made credit watchers wary, the Bloomberg report added. Early efforts to build AI infrastructure were largely financed by companies themselves, such as Google and Meta. But more recently, that money has been coming more and more from private credit lenders and bond investors, the report said.\n\n\u201cPrivate credit funding of artificial intelligence is running at around $50 billion a quarter, at the low end, for the past three quarters,\u201d Matthew Mish, head of credit strategy at UBS, told Bloomberg. \u201cEven without factoring in the mega deals from Meta and Vantage, they are already providing two to three times what the public markets are providing.\u201d\n\nIn other AI news, PYMNTS spoke last week with Discover\u00ae Network Director of Payments Innovation Kate Lybarger about efforts by businesses to both use this new technology, while also deploying in ways that align with evolving customer expectations and regulatory scrutiny.\n\nLybarger contended that AI isn\u2019t a revolution for revolution\u2019s sake. It\u2019s a relatively new tool, although a powerful one, that must be employed precisely, transparently and responsibly.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re building anything with AI, nothing matters more than trust,\u201d she said. \u201cThese solutions require a lot of data, potentially your customers\u2019 information.\u201d",

      "text": "Fears that the AI industry is overhyped are reportedly helping drive down tech stocks.\nThat\u2019s according to a Financial Times report Wednesday (Aug. 20), which pointed to downturns in the European and Asian markets following declines of big name tech companies such as Nvidia, Arm and Palantir.\nHelping fuel this drop, the report added, is a new report from MIT which found that most organizations are getting \u201czero return\u201d on their investments into the generative artificial intelligence (AI) space.\n\u201cThe story is spooking people,\u201d a trader close to a multibillion-dollar US tech fund told the FT.\nThe MIT report found that only 5% of \u201cintegrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable [profit and loss] impact.\u201d\nMeanwhile, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned last week that an AI bubble could be forming.\n\u201cAre investors over excited? My opinion is yes,\u201d Altman said in an interview reported by The Verge. \u201cI do think some investors are likely to lose a lot of money, and I don\u2019t want to minimize that, that sucks. There will be periods of irrational exuberance. But on the whole the value for society will be huge.\u201d\nThe FT report also noted the rise of Chinese firm DeekSeek, which earlier this year released a high-performing AI modelthat called into question the level of spending by American artificial intelligence firms.\nDeepSeek claimed that model only cost $5.6 million to train using about 2,000 of slower Nvidia chips. That figure is significantly lower than what it took to train frontier models from companies like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic.\nThe news erased $600 billion of market value from Nvidia in a single day. While tech stocks rebounded, the FT says the incident highlighted investor sensitivity to negative AI news.\nIn related news, PYMNTS last week explored the cost of owning AI models for enterprises. While the cost of the models has fallen since 2022, the overall cost of ownership \u201chas been resistant to declines,\u201d said Muath Juady, founder of SearchQ.AI.\n\u201cThe real expenses lie in the hidden infrastructure, including data engineering teams, security compliance, constant model monitoring, and integration architects necessary to connect AI with existing systems,\u201d added Juady.\nFor every dollar spent on AI models, companies are spending $5 to $10 to make the models \u201cproduction-ready and enterprise-compliant,\u201d Juady told PYMNTS. \u201cThe integration challenges tend to be more expensive than the technology itself and require substantial investment in change management and process redesign, which many organizations underestimate.\u201d\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter."

      "text": "Even though artificial intelligence has come to dominate headlines, product roadmaps and quarterly investor calls, one concept remains stubbornly analog: trust.\n\u201cEvery major evolution or transformation centers on what matters most: the structure of your business model, what your customers need, expect and trust from you,\u201d Discover\u00ae Network Director of Payments Innovation Kate Lybarger told PYMNTS. \u201cAnd I may argue, trust being the most important of those three.\u201d\nThat\u2019s particularly true when it comes to AI, she said. While earlier periods of enterprise innovation, such as mobile and digital, were reactions to external constraints, AI introduces internal and existential pressure. Businesses now grapple with not only how to use this new technology, but also how to deploy it in ways that align with evolving customer expectations and regulatory scrutiny.\nLybarger, who has spent her career at the intersection of emerging technologies and enterprise transformation, said AI isn\u2019t a revolution for revolution\u2019s sake. It\u2019s a relatively new tool, albeit a powerful one, that must be wielded with precision, transparency and responsibility.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re building anything with AI, nothing matters more than trust,\u201d she said. \u201cThese solutions require a lot of data, potentially your customers\u2019 information.\u201d\nThe stakes are at their highest in security-critical industries like financial services, where transactions can be fast, frequent and sensitive.\nThe New Frontier as Generative AI Is Supplanted by Agentic Commerce\nOne of the most notable shifts taking place is the transition across payments and commerce from general-purpose generative AI tools to what\u2019s being termed agentic commerce, representing a more targeted, transactional application of advanced AI technologies, Lybarger said.\n\u201cWe [the industry] are agentic commerce-obsessed right now,\u201d she said, adding that while the technology promises to enhance the customer experience, it\u2019s also important to balance innovation with risk management. Best practices include incorporating extensive testing and human-centered guardrails before introducing AI systems or models into any customer or business setting.\n\u201c[There are] all kinds of precedents with technology that has the power to impersonate you,\u201d she said. \u201cThe responsible and ethical use of these tools is paramount.\u201d\nFor Discover Network, this isn\u2019t just a philosophical stance. It\u2019s a strategic imperative. AI is a means, not an end, Lybarger said. It must be applied with caution, clarity and a deep understanding of what problems need to be solved.\n\u201cHow businesses adopt and deploy AI and how they think about managing situations when things don\u2019t go right, because they inevitably at some point won\u2019t, that matters deeply,\u201d she said.\nWhile one of the more tantalizing promises of AI is its ability to synthesize internal knowledge across departments and eliminate the dreaded corporate silo, AI development has not progressed to that stage yet.\n\u201cAI may not be mature enough to be deployed successfully for a given problem at a given time,\u201d Lybarger said. \u201cBut when it is, and when it\u2019s applied to the right problem, it can reinforce the value of your business model, perhaps in a way that\u2019s more effective and efficient.\u201d\nBuilding Ethical AI Foundations in Financial Services\nAlthough Lybarger is immersed in AI-related initiatives, she said the technology isn\u2019t the answer for everything.\n\u201cInnovation isn\u2019t only about AI,\u201d she said. \u201cContrary to all the ways in which we can\u2019t stop talking about AI, it is still, and will continue to be, about solving the right problems in the right way, which may or may not require AI.\u201d\nInnovation is the \u201cability to solve a problem in a manner that someone else finds value in,\u201d she said. \u201cIn this equation, then I, as a company, deliver value to you, and in exchange, I capture value for me.\u201d\nThat balanced exchange between delivering and capturing value is where AI finds its rightful place. It\u2019s a supporting actor, not the lead. This perspective can also help temper expectations.\n\u201cAI is not good at a lot of stuff yet,\u201d Lybarger said. \u201cWhich is hard to believe, given how oversaturated with AI amazingness we are at every turn \u2026 [while] AI is solving just about any problem you can think of, the reality is, that shouldn\u2019t be today\u2019s expectation.\u201d\nEmbracing a level-headed and clear-eyed view of AI\u2019s role in business model evolution can, in turn, raise new organizational questions around deployment and responsibility.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, people want to make payments, and they want it to work when they need it and in the way they want it to,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we can deploy AI solutions to help make that easier, faster, more secure, then we\u2019re going to continue pressure-testing and exploring those opportunities.\u201d\nFor all PYMNTS AI, B2B and digital transformation coverage, subscribe to the daily AI, B2B and Digital Transformation Newsletters."

      "text": "Tech companies are reportedly continuing to press the White House and Congress to pass legislation that would block states from regulating artificial intelligence.\nAfter an attempt to attach a 10-year ban to President Donald Trump\u2019s tax legislation failed in June, industry lobbyists aim to attach it to future legislation, Bloomberg reported Thursday (Aug. 21).\nIn July, lobbyists successfully pushed for Trump\u2019s AI plan to include a directive to stop AI-related funding from going to states with \u201cunduly restrictive\u201d AI regulation, according to the report.\nStates are considering a collective total of about 500 laws that would regulate the development and deployment of AI, the report said.\nFive states have already passed laws that apply to tech companies and more have passed ones that affect how businesses use the technology, per the report.\nTech industry representatives argue that regulation would slow the development of AI, that a patchwork of state laws would be more difficult to deal with than federal legislation, and that regulations should apply to how the technology is used, rather than the tech itself, according to the report.\nAdvocates of state regulations counter that the federal government has failed to pass comprehensive AI legislation, that the technology can be used to harm consumers and artists, and that states should be free to pass laws that protect their citizens, per the report.\nIt was reported in June that the tech industry was divided over the proposed 10-year ban on state regulation of AI models. While some industry representatives said regulation would slow the progress of the technology and impede the U.S. in its competition with China, others said the ban would favor Big Tech companies and prevent accountability for those who build technology that could cause foreseeable harm.\nSenators voted 99-1 in July to remove the proposed ban from Trump\u2019s tax legislation. The move was seen as a defeat for Big Tech companies.\nIt was reported in March that while state legislators were introduced AI-related bills at a record pace, the bills tended to have more of a pro-innovation intent than a stricter, European Union-style focus on reigning in risks.\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter."

      "text": "\u201cWhen bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,\u201d Sam Altman said in a Friday (Aug. 15) interview with The Verge.\n\u201cIf you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited. Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.\u201d\nAltman\u2019s comments to the Verge were flagged Monday (Aug. 18) in a report by CNBC, which notes that the CEO is not alone in raising concerns about the speed of AI growth, joining the likes of Alibaba Co-founder Joe Tsai, Bridgewater Associates\u2019 Ray Dalio and Apollo Global Management Chief Economist Torsten Slok.\nSlok had contended that today\u2019s AI bubble is actually bigger than the dotcom bubble, with the 10 leading companies in the S&P 500 more overvalued than they were during the 1990s, the CNBC report added.\nRay Wang, CEO of Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research, told the network that he believed Altman\u2019s comments carry some weight, but that the risks depend on the company.\n\u201cFrom the perspective of broader investment in AI and semiconductors \u2026 I don\u2019t see it as a bubble. The fundamentals across the supply chain remain strong, and the long-term trajectory of the AI trend supports continued investment,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, AI companies continue to rake in significant amounts of funding. Last week saw OpenAI rival Cohere raise $500 million at a $6.8 billion valuation. Also last week, Cognition reportedly raised $500 million to support its AI software code generation products, with the funding round doubling the company\u2019s valuation to $9.8 billion.\nIn other AI news, PYMNTS wrote recently about predictions about the technology\u2019s potential to one day cure cancer. Many experts expressed various degrees of skepticism about such claims.\n\u201cThe idea that AI will eliminate cancer is incredibly optimistic, but honestly, it is not as straightforward as it sounds,\u201d said Kiara DeWitt, CEO of Injectco and a nurse. \u201cAlthough AI can drastically improve diagnostics \u2026 a full cure is another matter entirely.\u201d\nAlthough AI-driven image recognition software has the potential to increase five-year survival rates by 30%, DeWitt added, \u201ccuring\u201d every case is \u201cstill beyond AI\u2019s reach alone.\u201d\n\u201cMost cancer \u2018cures\u2019 are heavily individualized, dependent on patient genetics, immune responses and countless environmental variables no AI model fully comprehends today,\u201d she said.\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter."

  "argos_summary": "Credit investors are pouring billions into AI infrastructure, with major deals such as Meta\u2019s $29\u202fbillion data\u2011center project and a $22\u202fbillion loan for Vantage Data Centers, amid growing fears of an AI bubble that could hurt tech stocks.  Private credit funding for AI is now running at roughly $50\u202fbillion a quarter, outpacing public\u2011market investment, while OpenAI projects it will need trillions to build the necessary infrastructure.  A MIT study and comments from OpenAI\u2019s CEO Sam Altman have highlighted that most companies see little return on generative\u2011AI investments, contributing to market volatility.  Meanwhile, regulators and industry groups are debating federal legislation to curb state AI rules, reflecting concerns over unchecked AI growth and its societal impact.",
