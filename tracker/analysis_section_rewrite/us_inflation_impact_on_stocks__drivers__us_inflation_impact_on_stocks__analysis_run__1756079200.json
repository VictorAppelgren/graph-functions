      "feedback": "This draft has a solid base: it ties CPI/inflation dynamics to Fed policy, discount rates, and cross-asset valuations, and it rightly centers a 3-regime map and Ford-margin risk in an EV-transition frame, with a concise watch-list. However, several weaknesses keep it from world-class quality: (1) horizon and regime framing are inconsistent—near-term Regime I is described separately from a “compact 3-regime map” of Regimes A/B/C—harmonize by mapping the near-term to one regime (or renaming the near-term regime) and clearly state criteria/transition triggers for each regime; (2) the causal chain should be sharpened and made testable from first principles: lay out a crisp 5–6 step transmission (inflation data → Fed reaction function → discount rate path → risk premia → valuations → sector earnings/flows → equity demand) and explicitly show how tariffs, policy, and auto-margin dynamics feed Ford and broader markets; (3) quantification is underused: anchor all claims to the cited 0.30%–0.40% MoM CPI path, supply concrete thresholds for regime shifts (e.g., CPI prints at or above the 0.40% path for two consecutive months or Fed guidance signals accelerated normalization) and, where possible, attach ranges or envelopes rather than qualitative descriptors like “range-bound”; (4) increase citation density and alignment: tie each major assertion to the IDs in SOURCE MATERIAL (Y6SQOEK69) and reconcile any conflicts between Regime I and the 3-regime map; explicitly attribute tariff/policy-exposure to Regime C as a driver of risk-off dynamics; (5) edit tone and content: remove or credibly substantiate the Kevin O’Leary reference, correct the trailing “con,” and ensure Ford’s margin risk language is grounded or footnoted with sector data if available; (6) watch-list refinement: present as a tight 4–5 bullets with clear confirmation and invalidation criteria, including which CPI prints, Fed guidance shifts, tariff developments, and automaker-margin readings would push the regime toward A or C; (7) deliver a succinct cross-asset payoff framework or sensitivity summary by regime to satisfy the cross-topic focus on macro/policy/flows/valuation/technicals.",
