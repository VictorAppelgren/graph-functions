      "feedback": "Overall, the draft succeeds in laying a regime-based framework and tying macro/policy/flows to earnings/multiples, and it reliably cites specific anchors (Ford EV metrics, oil supply/demand, tariff truce), but it falls short on a tightly reasoned causal chain, scenario structure, and quantified sensitivity; to reach world-class, restructure into a rigorous, first-principles scenario tree and embed explicit, source-grounded magnitudes and triggers: (1) define Regime A/B/C with explicit, source-backed thresholds and update probabilities (A ~50%, B ~30%, C ~20%) at the top, then map how each regime shifts inflation, real rates, and policy path and how those shifts drive S&P earnings, multiples, and capex allocation (tie these to NL5YYTLF2, 37UZC9X8I, T1QE6JPIX, and RHXDOHQQX); (2) articulate the causal chain from tariffs baseline ~10% and escalation risk to input costs, margin compression, and a productive reallocation toward U.S. fabs/AI/data-center infrastructure, with quantified margin and capex implications anchored by the cited sources (SGB2PAZGK; NL5YYTLF2; T1QE6JPIX); (3) strengthen the oil cross-topic linkage by presenting a regime-specific oil-path mapping (2025–26 supply/demand deltas, refinery runs, and the resulting price bands for Brent/WTI) and show how oil moves the macro floor and earnings (J99EM2TPZ); (4) translate the Ford example and ACMR anchors into a coherent long-horizon P/L framework with numbers (e.g., earnings range, gross margin trajectory, ROIC) under each regime, plus a simple DCF-style sensitivity to discount-rate shifts; (5) introduce explicit catalysts/invalidation points and a concise watch-list: next inflation print and Fed guidance, tariff-policy updates, oil-inventory data, and credible capex announcements, with path-dependence notes on AI/semiconductor spend; (6) quantify and bound leverage of each signal (e.g., how a 25–50 bps surprise in inflation shifts multiples by X%, or how a tariff escalation alters ACMR’s 2025 revenue midpoint); (7) reconcile conflicts across sources by clearly attributing each number to its source, avoiding duplicative citations, and presenting a single coherent scenario path instead of parallel, unintegrated numbers; (8) tighten presentation to a single compact paragraph that preserves named sources (NL5YYTLF2; T1QE6JPIX; SGB2PAZGK; 37UZC9X8I; 22PL3Q360; J99EM2TPZ; RHXDOHQQX) and clearly associates each claim with its source, while trimming redundancies and ensuring the overall length remains concise and readable.",
