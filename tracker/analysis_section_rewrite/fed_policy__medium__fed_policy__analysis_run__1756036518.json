      "feedback": "This draft captures the right macro tilt and ACMR-specific catalysts but needs a tighter, source-grounded 3–6 month scenario map with explicit triggers, invalidations, and timing windows; to upgrade, rewrite into a structured base-case and 1–2 alts anchored to the three critical sources (SK994CBWR, C22MKA9VY, Q7VVGNSQE) and link every assertion to a numeric datapoint from those IDs. Specifically, build a macro-to-stock transmission plot: (i) state a base-case for Fed policy (e.g., September 50bp cut initiating a gradual easing cycle, with a 150–175bp cumulative easing path implied by Bessent’s view) and tie it to ACMR’s valuation/risk appetite via consensus targets (30.53 vs 34.76 target) and the implied upside if earnings power/Margins hold (gross margin 49.4%, net margin 13.8%, debt/equity 23.3% from the source, plus 2025 guidance of $850–$950m revenue and Q2 revenue of $215m); (ii) codify a company-specific trigger: if ACMR sustains 850–950m revenue guidance and product-cycle milestones on Ultra C with N2 bubbling technology, then expect a re-rating; if earnings cadence or guidance disappoints or export-controls intensify, invalidate the upside; (iii) add a second catalyst set from the small-cap rotation narrative: IPO rebound (there were ~95 IPOs in 2025 to date) and Russell 2000 valuation reset, implying more demand for niche semicap plays; quantify the potential lift to ACMR if small-cap regime strengthens; (iv) specify timing windows (e.g., rate-cut initial in Sep; IPO momentum continuing through Q4; ACMR milestones over the next 2–3 quarters); (v) insert watch-list signals: CPI trajectory, rate-cut cadence, IPO counts, ACMR product-cycle milestones, and any breakpoints in U.S.–China export/tech-controls; (vi) articulate 1–2 clear invalidation points (e.g., if September cut is delayed beyond Q3 or if ACMR fails to hit mid-point of 2025 guidance; if ACMR revenue or gross margins deteriorate meaningfully); (vii) quantify outcomes: present a base-case price-trajectory with a plausible target range (near consensus 34.76 by end of 3–6 months if macro and product-cycle play out) and a couple of alt paths with downside/upside bands; (viii) tighten the narrative to avoid mixed causality (e.g., the Russell piece is about small-cap regime; explicitly map how that regime would transmit to ACMR via flows and multiple expansion rather than treating it as a standalone signal); (ix) deepen first-principles grounding by tying margins, liquidity, and capex (gross margin ~49.4%, net margin ~13.8%, debt/equity ~23%) to earnings quality and resilience under a base-case macro; (x) ensure all citations are exclusively SK994CBWR, C22MKA9VY, and Q7VVGNSQE, with each factual claim tied to one of those IDs and no inferred numbers beyond what they report; (xi) compress the write-up into a single cohesive paragraph that ends with the base-case, 1–2 alts, explicit risks, watch-list signals, and a stated confidence level, ensuring the horizon/style matches SECTION FOCUS.",
