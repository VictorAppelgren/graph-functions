  "content": "In the artificial intelligence (AI) model race, news headlines usually congregate around the competition among OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek and xAI. But there are many more startups developing frontier AI models beyond the favored five.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nCohere is one of them. On Thursday (Aug. 14), the Canadian startup announced in a blog post that it has raised $500 million in new funding at a $6.8 billion valuation in an oversubscribed round that included investments from Nvidia, AMD and Salesforce.\n\nLed by Oxford graduate Aidan Gomez as CEO, Cohere said it has hired Joelle Pineau, Meta\u2019s former vice president of AI research, to be its chief AI officer. Cohere has also hired Francois Chadwick as its CFO. Chadwick is a partner at KPMG but spent a decade at Uber including as acting CFO.\n\nCohere has positioned itself as exclusively selling to businesses, training its models on internal company data and often running AI workloads on company premises rather than in the cloud, according to a Thursday report from the Financial Times.\n\nThe AI startup also focuses on security, with Gomez saying in the blog post that this need is \u201csimply not being met by repurposed consumer models.\u201d\n\nHowever, the startup has fallen into similar legal challenges as its rivals. In February, the News Media Alliance sued Cohere for alleged copyright infringement. The lawsuit said Cohere improperly trained its AI model on at least 4,000 copyrighted works, according to The Wall Street Journal. Cohere told PYMNTS the lawsuit was \u201cmisguided and frivolous.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the startup continues to bring in enterprise business. Cohere told the FT that it has doubled annual recurring revenue to $100 million in 2025 and aims to reach $200 million by year-end.\n\nCohere said it is working with Oracle, Dell, RBC, Bell, Fujitsu, LG CNS, SAP and Ensemble Health Partners to deploy its AI models at companies in finance, healthcare, telecom, manufacturing and energy sectors, as well as in the public sector.\n\nOn Aug. 6, Cohere launched North, which it describes as a \u201csecurity-first\u201d agentic AI platform. North integrates Cohere\u2019s generative and search models with workflow automation tools. North is used for private deployments and requires as few as two GPUs. It supports compliance with global standards including GDPR, SOC 2, ISO 27001 and ISO 42001.\n\nCohere said North is being used by clients such as the Royal Bank of Canada, which enables employees to summarize reports, retrieve internal data and generate charts and graphs while keeping data on premises. Dell is integrating North into their AI factory infrastructure, enabling customers to build and run AI agents within their own environments.\n\nCohere\u2019s funding round was co-led by Radical Ventures and Inovia Capital, with participation from AMD Ventures, Nvidia, PSP Investments, Salesforce Ventures, Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan and others.\n\nRead more: Cohere \u2018Not Chasing AGI\u2019 as AI Startup\u2019s Value Hits $5 Billion",

      "text": "As Bloomberg News reported Monday (July 22), this $500 million round brings Cohere\u2019s total funding to $970 million.\nAccording to the report, Canada-based Cohere is the rare artificial intelligence (AI) startup creating massive large language models from scratch, partly because the technology is extremely expensive and difficult to build.\nAnd while rivals such as OpenAI and Google are trying to build artificial general intelligence, or AGI, or AI software that can perform tasks at or above the level of humans, Cohere is instead focused on more practical goals, Co-founder Nick Frosst told Bloomberg.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not out there chasing AGI,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make models that can be efficiently run in an enterprise to solve real problems.\u201d\nThe company, Bloomberg notes, has clients from an array of industries, including retailers, tech companies and banks. For example, Toronto-Dominion Bank, a new customer, plans to use Cohere\u2019s AI for tasks like answering questions based on financial documents.\n\u201cMy favorite use cases of this technology are the ones that power things that nobody wants to do,\u201d Frosst said.\nThat means things like the startup Borderless AI using Cohere\u2019s models to answer questions on employment law around the world in multiple languages.\nMeanwhile, recent research by PYMNTS Intelligence shows that most large companies are struggling to deploy AI in meaningful ways, lagging the race to leverage AI. The findings in \u201cThe Impact of GenAI on a COO\u2019s Priorities,\u201d the third edition of PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s \u201c2024 CAIO Project,\u201d present a sobering reality check for the AI revolution.\nThe report, based on surveys of chief operating officers from companies with at least $1 billion in yearly revenue, uncovers a major gap between the perceived potential of generative AI and how it is now being applied in the corporate world.\nThe research showed that 70% of those COOs agreed that GenAI is a critical part of strategic planning. Still, there is a gap between aspiration and reality.\n\u201cThis disconnect between vision and execution is particularly striking, given AI\u2019s high-profile nature in today\u2019s business landscape,\u201d PYMNTS wrote last week. \u201cWith tech giants and startups alike touting its transformative power, many had expected to see more rapid and widespread adoption of advanced AI applications in large enterprises.\u201d\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter."

      "text": "The federal lawsuit, filed Thursday (Feb. 13) in New York, accuses Cohere of improperly using at least 4,000 copyrighted works to train its AI large language model, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Thursday.\nIn addition, the suit also accuses Cohere of displaying large portions of articles \u2014 if not articles in their entirety \u2014 while bypassing visits to the publishers\u2019 websites. And in some cases, the suit said, Cohere has infringed on publishers\u2019 trademarks by producing \u201challucinated\u201d material \u2014 with information that was never actually published by the news outlet \u2014 under a publisher\u2019s name.\n\u201cOur content is being stored and used to create verbatim and substitutional copies of our material,\u201d said Danielle Coffey, CEO of the News Media Alliance, which organized the suit on behalf of its members. \u201cThat\u2019s theft.\u201d\nAccording to the WSJ, the suit seeks $150,000 in damages \u2014 the maximum under the law \u2014 for each instance of copyright infringement. They also want Cohere to destroy any copyrighted work within its possession.\nA spokesperson for Cohere told PYMNTS the company stands by its training practices and prioritizes controls to reduce the risk of intellectual property infringement.\n\u201cWe would have welcomed a conversation about their specific concerns \u2014 and the opportunity to explain our enterprise-focused approach \u2014 rather than learning about them in a filing,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe believe this lawsuit is misguided and frivolous, and expect this matter to be resolved in our favor.\u201d\nPlaintiffs in the suit include Cond\u00e9 Nast parent Advance, Forbes Media, The Guardian, Los Angeles Times, McClatchy, Business Insider, Newsday and The Toronto Star.\nThe lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal actions by media outlets against AI companies accused of copyright infringement. For example, The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement in December 2023.\nThe two AI partners were sued again last June, this time by the Center for Investigative Reporting, owner of the magazine Mother Jones.\n\u201cOpenAI and Microsoft started vacuuming up our stories to make their product more valuable, but they never asked for permission or offered compensation, unlike other organizations that license our material,\u201d Monika Bauerlein, CEO of CIR, said in a news release. \u201cThis free rider behavior is not only unfair, it is a violation of copyright.\u201d\nOpenAI has said it works collaboratively with news publishers. And indeed, the company last year launched a partnership with News Corp, though experts say that collaboration could ultimately go beyond just news.\n\u201cMost people will see the OpenAI-News Corp deal and assume it\u2019s about training data. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s about ChatGPT competing with Google Search,\u201d Nathaniel Whittemore, CEO of AI education company Superintelligent, told PYMNTS at the time.\n\u201cOpenAI doesn\u2019t just want ChatGPT to help you with your writing; it wants ChatGPT to help you with everything,\u201d he added. \u201cThat means turning ChatGPT into your primary gateway to the rest of the world.\u201d"
