Note that your ticket is held in trust by Jackpocket as the courier, and a Ticket is a bearer instrument within the meaning of all applicable law, such that the holder of the ticket is presumed to be the owner of the ticket with all applicable rights in the ticket and its proceeds. Therefore, if you obtain possession of your Winning Ticket, do not lose your Ticket or allow others to possess your Ticket. Jackpocket attempts to mitigate this risk by placing the winning customer's name on the back of the Ticket following the ticket being deemed a Winning Ticket, however Jackpocket cannot be held responsible for any lost or stolen tickets or other tickets that, for whatever reason, are not in the winning customer's possession.\n9.
