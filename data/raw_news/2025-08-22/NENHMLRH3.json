  "content": "The cyber-attack on Marks & Spencer is the kind of event that makes business leaders sit up and ponder whether their own organization could be next. While its services may now be up and running, the incident has still cost the brand over \u00a3300 million in lost profits, along with potential damage to its customer relationships.\n\nThe brand is not alone either, since attackers also hit the specialist food distributor Peter Green Chilled, integral to several supermarket supply chains, along with Coop, North Face and Cartier recently as well. The lasting impacts of these cybersecurity breaches have revealed how quickly a single compromise can affect revenue, logistics and brand trust, even if organizations have well-rehearsed contingency plans.\n\nThe UK\u2019s appetite for online shopping has grown from 18.1 per cent of total sales in September 2019 to around 26 per cent today. This growth brings increased volumes of payment credentials, loyalty data and personal profiles that retailers and their partners must store and access for the whole system to operate effectively.\n\nAs every part of the retail supply chain process, from stock control to fulfilment, is now digitally integrated in the battle for streamlined, multi-channel efficiency, it has become almost impossible to guarantee total security.\n\nCriminals want that data for ransom, resale or misuse, and incessantly seek it out. They have learned that the easiest way past expensive perimeter tools starts inside each business. A seasonal employee\u2019s click on an email, a misconfiguration in a loyalty-app update, or slack use of recycled passwords by a manager working from home are all weaknesses that criminals exploit.\n\nThe addition of hybrid working has also opened up many more potential entry points for criminals and complicates security vigilance.\n\nThe complex pipework of supply chain partner relationships makes continuous monitoring much harder. Retailers rely on third-party ecommerce software, CRM suites, point-of-sale systems and supply-chain tools. Vulnerabilities from even a single vendor or partner is enough to let criminals inside.\n\nArtificial intelligence, meanwhile, has automated phishing lures and vulnerability scanning. The development of off-the-shelf ransomware kits also means criminals need less technical expertise to be effective. They can deliver cyberattacks at greater frequency and speed with superior precision.\n\nRemoving all cyber risk is impossible, so organizations must switch focus to damage limitation and maintenance of legitimate trade, using layered security instead of relying totally on a single gatekeeper.\n\nHigh on the shopping list for retailers should be real-time endpoint detection and response (EDR) or extended detection and response (XDR) platforms. These solutions monitor devices, networks and cloud workloads for anomalous behavior, then isolate infected assets before malware spreads.\n\nStrict network segmentation limits an intruder\u2019s freedom of movement in systems. A zero-trust model will make life harder for them by demanding authentication for every access request.\n\nSometimes, the most effective containment measure is a deliberate shutdown to allow individual branches to keep trading on local platforms. This prevents attackers from scuttling through systems and enables investigators to get on with their work.\n\nLayered defense must involve employees as well as technology. Multi-factor authentication cuts down the threat from stolen passwords, while least-privilege principles ensure staff only access what is required for the task in-hand. Regular penetration tests expose weak spots before adversaries find them, and supply-chain audits encourage vendors to improve standards.\n\nPreparation is essential. Immutable off-site backups provide clean copies of critical data, but only if recovery time and recovery point objectives are realistic and regularly rehearsed. Full fail-over, forensic hand-off and customer communications must all be rehearsed.\n\nIt is also important to diversify infrastructure, avoiding reliance on what becomes a single fault domain through the mistake of running production, back-up and disaster-recovery environments on the same platform. What retailers need is a hybrid or multi-cloud approach to spread risk and improve flexibility.\n\nAfter the immediate threat is contained and systems are restored, rebuilding confidence is tough when customers, staff and investors are wanting details of what happened, the data exposed and how the company will prevent it from happening again.\n\nA timetable of transparent updates shows respect and reduces speculation. Each cyber event or breach should trigger policy changes and fresh internal training, reinforcing the message that security is a collective responsibility shared by everyone in every department.\n\nMany retailers use managed service providers (MSPs) to accelerate all these steps, bringing access to wider experience and expertise, round-the-clock monitoring and economies of scale. Retailers have the strategic oversight and sector knowledge, while the MSP supplies a deeper level of technical insight and a commitment to continuous improvement.\n\nWith the right partnerships, layered defenses, crisis response and security awareness, retailers can absorb attacks without day-to-day business grinding to a halt. They can continue to maintain the vital trust that is behind each customer transaction. There is certainly no reason to despair if organizations follow this multi-layered approach.\n\nWe list the best endpoint protection software .\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "A chain reaction: inside the cyberattack that brought M&S to its knees\nCyberattack exposes fragility of interconnected supply chains\nThe recent ransomware attack on the retailer, Marks and Spencer (M&S) is a stark reminder of just how exposed modern businesses are to cyber threats, not only within their own walls, but also through the very partners and suppliers they rely on for their daily operations.\nWhile M&S was not breached directly, the vulnerability of a third-party supplier provided an unintended entry-point that ultimately impeded operations, disrupted logistics and wiped hundreds of millions off its market value, further underscoring the shared responsibility of ensuring security across modern digital ecosystems in a business.\nThe cyberattack wasn\u2019t just a simple smash-and-grab, rather it was a calculated, multi-stage operation by notorious cybercrime group, Scattered Spider. It worked because the group created a perfect storm consisting of sophisticated phishing tactics, deft social engineering and a leveraged a simple supply chain link that wasn\u2019t toughened up to today\u2019s resilience standards.\nThe brunt of it is that it is no longer enough to protect a single business\u2019s cyber walls. In a hyperconnected ecosystem, the weakest supplier is the most vulnerable point and threat actors know it.\nVice President of EMEA\u2019s Consulting and Professional Services, Trustwave.\nHow the attack worked\nDetails emerging from the M&S breach suggest that the threat actors used phishing tactics to gain their initial foothold into a supplier\u2019s systems. While this is not confirmed in this particular case, it does fall in line with FBI reports that email is the primary starting-point for 90% of phishing incidents. Through impersonation and manipulation, the attackers convinced IT personnel at the supplier to reset authentication credentials, essentially handing over the keys to the digital kingdom.\nThis method of exploitation wasn\u2019t purely technical, rather deeply human. More commonly known as social engineering amongst cyber professionals, this tactic relies on psychological manipulation, exploiting trust, urgency or confusion to trick targets into compromising their own business\u2019s security. While the supplier\u2019s IT staff, henceforth dubbed \u2018innocent insiders\u2019, did not intend to harm, unfortunately and unintentionally they gave the attackers the access they needed, all in a moment of misjudgment.\nOnce the foothold was established, the attackers were able to deploy the ransomware and subsequently disrupt food logistics, shutter operations, and inflict an expected \u00a3300 million hit to operating profits. This led to over \u00a3750 million being erased from M&S\u2019s market capitalization in the fallout. While the scale of this incident is exceptional, it reflects a broader trend in the sector. In fact, according to Trustwave\u2019s recent research on the retail cyber threat landscape, the average cost of a breach in the industry is approximately \u00a32.6 million, underscoring just how financially damaging these incidents can be, even at baseline.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nDespite this, it should be recognized that M&S\u2019s swift decision to take its website, mobile app, contactless payment systems, and Click & Collect services offline demonstrates a responsible containment strategy. While this caused disruption to consumers, it aligns with best-practice incident response protocols aimed at halting further spread and preserving customer trust.\nThe rise of third-party risk\nThis incident is not unique to M&S. What makes it particularly instructive is how clearly it illustrates the growing threat posed by third party risk.\nIt is no secret that most organizations today operate within sprawling digital ecosystems, relying on dozens, sometimes even hundreds, of external vendors for everything from cloud hosting and IT services to logistics and customer support. While this interdependence drives forward efficiency and innovation, it also significantly expands the attack surface, within which cybercriminals can operate successfully.\nDespite growing awareness, supplier security is still too often treated as a secondary concern, either addressed during onboarding or relegated to contractual obligations. But in today\u2019s threat landscape, it\u2019s essential that supplier networks be held to the same standards of resilience as internal operations. This means adopting continuous oversight, setting clear access controls, and treating cyber assurance as an ongoing process rather than a one-off audit.\nLessons from the breach\nAnother thing that was laid bare as a result of this cyberattack, and something businesses need to be keenly aware of, is that even the most well intentioned employee can be manipulated. To defend against this threat, cybersecurity training, especially on common phishing tactics and social engineering methods in any given industry, is non-negotiable. To supplement this effort, simulations and scenario-based drills can be used as these help employees better recognize red flags in the system and how to respond appropriately.\nA simple, yet effective method to prevent unauthorized access is to implement multifactor authentication (MFA) across all systems. According to Microsoft, 99% of the compromised Microsoft accounts in the M&S breach did not have MFA enabled. In addition to this, the principle of least privilege must be followed to ensure that employees and third parties alike only have the access that is absolutely required. This ensures that even if a threat actor gains access to an organization's systems, they are unable to move laterally within the network.\nIn fact, to truly limit the spread of threats once the hacker has already gained access, businesses must embrace network segmentation. This is a cybersecurity practice that divides a network into smaller, isolated sections, each with its own access controls and security protocols. One can think of this as compartmentalizing a building where, instead of giving every employee a master key to every room, the access is restricted so people can only enter those areas that are necessary for their jobs.\nBeyond internal defenses, organizations must also work collaboratively with their suppliers to enhance overall security of their vendor network. This requires knowing exactly what data a vendor has access to, understanding how they manage security and integrating them within the core business\u2019s awareness and response plans. Additionally, threat intelligence sharing, joint training exercises and clear incident response plans can transform supplier networks from a liability into an organization's first line of defense.\nThe final line of defense, especially in a ransomware scenario is having a robust backup and recovery strategy in place. Threat actors employing ransomware tactics often target backup systems to prevent quick recovery. With this in mind, backups need to be stored offline or in immutable environments, which cannot be changed or encrypted by attackers. To ensure that restoration works in practice and not just in theory, regular testing of the backups is another key step in bolstering an organization's cyber defense posture.\nThe bottom line\nUltimately, the M&S incident is a real-world case study of the operational fragility that can arise when cybersecurity isn\u2019t fully embedded across the supply chain. It also provides a powerful lesson for the organizations across various sectors that resilience must extend beyond internal networks and into the broader digital ecosystem. In a world where every transaction, delivery, and customer interaction relies on technology, effective defense demands both strategic investment and human vigilance, both within the business and across its partners.\nTrain up with the best online cybersecurity courses.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

By creating an online store, you can access a broader base of customers who may never have encountered your products if you were selling to a local community from a single retail outlet.\nAs well as building online stores, the best ecommerce tools can help you take payments online through point-of-sale (POS) technology, manage your inventory, and answer customer queries. From a financial point of view, shifting some of your business to an ecommerce platform can also help you reduce overhead. And, if you\u2019re working entirely online, an ecommerce platform could eliminate the need to pay rent on retail premises or to employ certain staff.\nAlthough many small business owners fear ecommerce is the preserve of tech-savvy whiz kids, plenty of options require little or no coding skills. We\u2019ve rounded up five of the best ecommerce tools that could help you get your online business up and running.\nThe best ecommerce software tools of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest ecommerce software overall\n1. Wix\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAs well as being a behemoth of website building, Wix offers one of the best ecommerce tools for business owners looking to sell their goods online. The platform\u2019s most attractive feature for those who are not particularly tech-savvy is its ease of use.\nTo create your store, you can choose from more than 500 designer-made templates, which can drastically reduce the levels of stress involved in the process. If, however, you\u2019re more confident with design, the platform gives you the option to customize every aspect, from the storefront to the checkout.\nIf you\u2019re marketing your products to repeat customers, Wix\u2019s subscription service enables you to accept recurring payments and to sell members-only content. The platform also gives you the option to accept payments via a variety of payment methods, including all major credit card companies and Stripe.\nThe most significant negative you\u2019re likely to encounter is that your store will automatically display Wix-branded ads if you opt for the free plan. Likewise, some users report frustrations with backlogs in the platform\u2019s inventory management system.\nRead our full Wix review.\nBest ecommerce software for newbies\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you\u2019re a tech novice, Shopify could be the right ecommerce solution for you, as you won\u2019t need any knowledge of coding or HTML to set up your venture. Should you encounter difficulties, you can take advantage of the platform\u2019s 24/7 customer support.\nThe platform enables you to accept payments via all major credit cards and provides a fast checkout procedure through Shopify Pay or Apple Pay.

Although basic subscribers can upload unlimited products to their accounts, the cheapest plans only enable you to add two users to your plan.\nRead our full Shopify review.\nBest ecommerce software for dropshipping\n3. Spocket\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWhile you may be familiar with the image of an online seller as a hobbyist who takes to the internet to promote their homemade bracelets, you may be less familiar with the concept of dropshipping, which is the idea behind ecommerce app Spocket. In simple terms, you act as go-between for your suppliers and customers, accepting orders via your store without keeping goods in stock yourself.\nIf this model sounds appealing, the company enables you to view a set of potential products, which you can then test before adding to your store. Once you\u2019ve sold your chosen items, your suppliers will sort out your inventory and ship the goods directly to your customers.\nA free plan allows you to browse Spocket's product catalog, see what might work for you. After that, the Starter plan supports up to 25 products, while the top-of-the-range handles a huge 20,000 products.\nThe biggest drawback we identified here is potential delivery times. At best, these can be as little as several days, but it may take up to a couple of weeks for buyers to receive their items.\nIs Spocket worth a dabble? There's a lot of dropshipping competition, but while you may not want to rely on your Spocket profits to pay your bills each month, the solution could be an effective means of earning a little extra on the side.\nBest ecommerce software for customer comms\n4. ProProfs Help Desk\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWhether you\u2019re taking your first tentative steps into the world of ecommerce or are a seasoned pro, chances are you sometimes feel inundated by questions from your customers. Cloud-based customer service software ProProfs Help Desk enables you to convert all your customer communication into unique tickets.\nThrough the use of shared inboxes, your team members can then collaborate to answer these queries as quickly as possible.\nThe free plan is limited to a single user, which may be adequate if you\u2019re a sole proprietor, although you should bear in mind that this option doesn\u2019t include customer support.\nBest ecommerce software for mobile checks\n5. Responsive Design Checker\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFree browser-based tool Responsive Design Checker enables you to enter your website\u2019s url into a search box and instantly see how it will appear on some of the most common devices used by your customers. Using these insights, you can audit your website\u2019s design for maximum possible impact.\nIn one of the tool\u2019s most impressive features, you can interact with the content on your site by clicking on links and typing information into search fields.\nWhile Responsive Design Checker is quick, easy and free, it only provides an approximation of how your site will appear on mobile devices. BrowserStack's Responsive Design Testing supports many more device types, and include paid plans allowing you to test your site on 3,000+ real browsers and devices.\nWe've also listed the best ecommerce hosting.\nBest ecommerce software FAQs\nWhich ecommerce software are best for you?\nWhen deciding which ecommerce tools to use, first consider what your actual needs are, as the cheapest options may only provide basic features, so if you need to use advanced settings you may find a more expensive platform is better suited to you. Additionally, higher-end software can usually cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require from your ecommerce tools.\nHow we tested the best ecommerce software\nTo test for the best ecommerce tools we first set up an account with the relevant provider, then we tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations.

The allows quick and easy credit card payment processing, both online and offline. Payment gateway systems also work with Point of Sale (POS) processing in-store.\nPut simply, payment gateways provide a means to charge cards and any fees are subsequently charged to the business owner, or merchant, with rates commonly anywhere between 1.4%-3.5%, and often with no monthly fees either.\nIn addition, if you have a merchant account, processing fees are reduced to around interchange fees, which are typically around 0.10%-20% per transaction, and come with monthly fees.\nHaving a simple payment gateway can be a great way to handle low volume sales. However, as monthly fees can eat into income more than processing fees you may find that once sales volume reaches a critical threshold it becomes cheaper to pay a monthly fee for merchant processing with interchange fees.\nSome of the best payment gateways offer both options, or a similar advantage over the competition. This may be in the form of processing fees for certain cards, to direct integration into accounting software. The same can be said for anyone with dedicated accounting software needs in the UK too.\nWe've compared these payment gateways across many factors, including ease of setup, ease of use, global processing, pricing plans, and mobile payments. We also looked at their security features, the currencies they support, and what types of businesses they'd best for.\nFeatured below are the current best payment gateways available.\nWe've also featured the best tax software.\nThe best payment gateway of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest payment gateway overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPayPal is one of the most widely used online payment platforms. Founded in 1998 as Cofinity, it lets you make and receive payments all over the world.\nPayPal provides payment processing services for e-commerce vendors, auction sites and other commercial entities globally, and allows you to accept credit cards including Amex and Visa. It also offers easy cart integration, plentiful customization options, online invoicing, and facilitates credit card payments over the phone.\nPayPal is normally associated with online marketplace eBay, but it\u2019s worth noting that since 2020, it ceased to be eBay\u2019s main payment option (as the company switched to Adyen \u2013 although PayPal is still offered as an optional payment service). In a statement made last year, eBay said it made the move to offer customers more competitive prices.\nPricing is competitive, with processing charged at 2.99% (+ fixed fee) per debit/credit card transaction, with no monthly fees, making it ideal for new and small businesses.\nRead our full PayPal review.\nPayPal - quick and easy card processing\nLike all of the best credit card processing companies, PayPal regularly features deals and incentives. Take a look at the latest methods for processing credit and debit card payments, including point of sale, QR codes and a mountain of other small business-friendly options.\nBest payment gateway for growing businesses\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nStripe is yet another powerful payment platform designed for internet businesses, with the company claiming to handle billions of dollars worth of transactions annually. The main difference between this service and many others is that it isn\u2019t an out-of-the-box solution. Instead, you\u2019re provided with a range of flexible tools to customize your own payment processes.\nDesigned for larger firms, it offers a plethora of APIs that allow you to create your own subscription services, on-demand marketplaces, or crowdfunding platforms. It supports a range of development languages, including Ruby, Python, PHP and Java.\nFurthermore, Stripe supports more than a hundred currencies, and offers features such as mobile payments, subscription billing and one-click checkout. Users also get access to a dashboard where they can visualize transactions. Clearly, then, this is a feature-rich payment gateway, although Stripe does demand a lot more technological knowledge from the user than most providers.\nStripe's processing fees for US cards are 2.9% (+30\u00a2). Additionally, for larger volume needs, it has a customized plan with volume discounts.\nRead our full Stripe review.\nStripe - easy access card payment processing\nIf you're looking for a quick and easy way to start processing card payment then Stripe has a range of options. It features a complete payments platform with simple, pay-as-you-go pricing currently set at 2.9% plus 30\u00a2 per successful card charge. Check out Stripe's current best deals.\nBest payment gateway for advanced analytics\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAdyen is used by companies such as Uber, Spotify, Microsoft and eBay to handle business and customer transactions. The software lets you accept every payment made to your company from a single platform, as well as giving you tools to manage risk and track results.\nNot only does Adyen accept more than 250 payment methods and 150 global currencies, but it also lets you analyze transaction data to benefit from \u201cdata-rich insights to learn customer behavior.\u201d\nFor example, you\u2019re able to identify buyer behavior and patterns, allowing you to tweak products and services appropriately. There\u2019s also a built-in risk management tool that sifts through data to identify and fight cases of fraud.\nProcessing fees vary by the method of payment, but the firm uses Interchange pricing, with an additional transaction fee. However, you will need a merchant bank account to take advantage of interchange pricing.\nRead our full Adyen review.\nAdyen - The global gateway\nThe Adyen payments platform supports all key payment methods globally. Also, many payment methods can be used outside of the shoppers\u2019 country. There's a processing fee plus payment method fee per transaction, no set-up fee, 24/7 in-house support and access to a full range of tools on the platform.\nBest payment gateway for fraud detection\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe main aim of these solutions is to streamline the payments process, and Authorize.net (from Visa) does exactly that. Developed with firms of all sizes in mind and offering a choice of plans, the platform gives you the tools to sell items and take payments online, or in-person at a store.\nWith the solution, you can accept payments from websites and transfer funds into a merchant bank account quickly. It supports all major credit cards, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, Diner\u2019s Club and JCB. As well as this, the platform is compatible with digital payment services such as Apple Pay, PayPal, and Visa Checkout.\nAlthough all payment gateways offer some tools to support fraud detections/prevention, Authorize.net takes it to the next level. The Advanced Fraud Detection Suite (AFDS) offers peace of mind by identifying, managing, and preventing suspicious transactions.\nAlthough the software can accept transactions made by customers all over the world, your business must be registered in the US, UK, Canada, Europe or Australia if you\u2019d like to use this service.\nThe entry level 'All-in-one' account comes with a $25 monthly fee, no sign up fee, and a 2.9% (+30\u00a2) transaction fee.\nRead the full Authorize.net review.\nAuthorize.net - fast and easy card processing\nThere's an easy three-step system in place for processing payments via Authorize.net. Choose a plan, complete the application and start processing. Pick from flexible options that include an All-in-One option with a per transaction rate of 2.9% + 30\u00a2 or a Payment Gateway Only package with a per transaction rate of 10\u00a2 and daily batch fee 10\u00a2 with no setup fee for both.\nBest payment gateway for flexibility\n5. Payline\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPayline is a Pineapple Payments company headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. It provides solutions to businesses ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies, with a focus on the payment experience.\nPayline offers gateway payment processing, and its web solutions are designed to integrate with over 175 online shopping carts. The company also offers mobile solutions designed to accept payments via mobile apps. The Payline payment processing gateway also integrates with QuickBooks for ease of payroll management, and business financials in general.\nPayline offers pricing based on the service. A swipe falls under Payline Start, which has a monthly fee with an additional small charge per transaction, which includes AMEX as well for an additional per transaction fee.\nPricing for bricks and mortar stores includes a monthly fee of $10 and a 0.4% (+$0.10) fee per transaction. For online stores, the monthly and transaction fees are $20 and include a 0.75% ($0.20) fee per transaction.\nPayline - small business specialist gateway\nPayline has packages to suit both small business and enterprise options for bigger concerns. Swiping in-person 0.4%, $0.10 per transaction / $10 per month. Online stores pay 0.75%, $0.20 per transaction / $20 per month. Try the free cost calculator.\nOther payment gateways to consider\nWhile we've mentioned some of the best merchant gateways, there are a number of others worth considering. This is especially as many are available to integrate with existing ecommerce platforms using nothing more than an easy-to-install plugin. Here, therefore, we'll list some additional merchant gateways that are well worth considering, according to the differing needs of online businesses.\n2Checkout is another payment provider that is commonly used by online merchants, not least because as well as one-off purchases it's easy to set up subscriptions. This makes it especially useful for online businesses selling digital services such as web hosting or web design companies. It's also commonly available as a plugin for major ecommerce platforms, and can process a wide range of global currencies.\nOpayo, offers not just a merchant gateway, but the ability to directly record all sales and transactions directly into your Sage accounting software. This makes it especially invaluable for efficiency purposes, not least because it means you can see your costs and income in real-time. However, while there are different plans available for Opayo, it's best to have a merchant account to get the most out of the software, not least for reducing transaction fees in the first place.\nFIS Global (previously Worldpay) is another popular payment gateway, with a number of integrations available for popular ecommerce platforms. You can set up as a paid-monthly service, or else use a merchant account to take advantage of interchange fees on all transactions. However, Worldpay has undergone significant changes over the past few years, after being owned by at least two different companies, so it's worth inquiring as to what services are currently available and at what price.\nWe've also featured the best merchant services.\nBest payment gateway FAQs\nWhat is a payment gateway?\nPayment gateways are tools used by merchants to receive payments from customers.\nAn online payment gateway is cloud-based and it helps merchants receive online payments from customers, while a brick-and-mortar retail store's payment gateway is a point-of-sale (POS) system or a card reader.\nHow to choose the best payment gateways for you?\nChoosing the best payment gateway to suit your business needs largely depends on what size your company is. If you're a smaller outlet, or sole trader, it may not be necessary to have a powerful payment gateway setup. That's especially so when you consider the sort of flexibility and convenience offered by PayPal.\nBeing able to offer the convenience of accepting card payments is an everyday necessity for most businesses and customers expect to have the option. So lookout for those that offer simplicity, value for money and also the opportunity to link them to POS systems, along with the ability to integrate into your accounting software.\nAt the same time, keep an eye on those terms and conditions, as outlined in our introduction. Fees can vary wildly from one payment gateway to another, so be sure to factor this in to your costings. Processing and interchange fees can add up, so be sure to allow for these.\nIf your business plans to process higher volumes of sales then you'll obviously want to plump for one of the more advanced packages, even though these invariably come with a higher price tag.\nHow we test the best payment gateways\nWhen we test payment gateways we're always on the lookout for a system that will make life easier for a business. Therefore, any package should suit the type and size of business its targeting. This means that some of the payment gateway options shown above are better suited to smaller, low volumes sales-type outlets.\nOn the other hand, if you're processing large volumes of credit card payments you'll need one of the beefier options listed in this guide. We try to find a practical balance between how systems operate on the target business market and compare that with the costs and fees that are involved.\nBusinesses are always looking for good value, so we try to ensure that any system we test provides all of the features and functions needed, without adding in extra costs for unwanted features that may never be needed.

      "text": "Best POS system of 2025\nPayment systems and ePOS software\nWe list the best Point Of Sale (POS) systems, to make it simple and easy to take payments in a store, a restaurant, or an event\nPoint-of-sale (POS) systems are the heart of many brick-and-mortar businesses. They enable business owners to receive payments without worrying about reliability and security.\nIn the early stages of the POS market, business owners mainly sought a simple solution for receiving and tracking payments. However, expectations have changed as the industry has matured. Businesses now look at complementary features that help them run operations in addition to receiving payments.\nI tested many POS systems so you don\u2019t have to stress yourself out about finding the best options with reliable payment processing and complementary features. In this buying guide, I\u2019ve curated the best POS systems for different use cases and explained what makes them excellent choices.\nReader offer: Get a GoDaddy $499.00 Smart Terminal POS device for free\nBoost productivity from the storefront to the back office with a sleek, modern POS terminal from GoDaddy. There\u2019s no contract to sign, and they offer 24/7 support. Plus, GoDaddy offers low processing fees starting from 2.3%* for in-person transactions.\nIf your business is a small one or a startup, then you might want to take a look at our guide to the best POS for small businesses; we also have guides tailored for different business types: the best POS for retail, and the best POS for restaurants and bars.\nThe best POS systems of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest general-purpose POS system\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nShopify is best known as an e-commerce platform but offers one of the best point-of-sale (POS) systems for brick-and-mortar retailers. Unsurprisingly, Shopify\u2019s POS system is heavily integrated with its e-commerce tools. It\u2019s an excellent option if you sell both online and in person.\nShopify offers one of the most intuitive interfaces I\u2019ve used in a POS system, and it\u2019s more impressive given its broad feature set. Its designers packed numerous features into an intuitive interface that was easy to understand.\nYou can manage your inventory seamlessly when using Shopify. Adding products to your catalog with key details like prices and variants is easy. When a customer buys an item, it\u2019s automatically subtracted from the inventory, and you can receive alerts when its quantity falls below a specific threshold.\nDepending on your Shopify plan, transaction fees range from 2.4% to 2.7%. Every plan includes free access to the POS Lite features, but accessing advanced POS Pro features requires an extra $89 per month per POS device. For example, POS Pro lets you monitor multiple POS systems from a centralized dashboard.\nBecause of its relatively high fees, Shopify is best suited for medium and large businesses, not small businesses with limited budgets.\nRead our full Shopify review.\nBest POS system for hotels\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nEpos Now is a versatile POS system that suits many business categories. However, I consider it the top choice for hotels, hostels, and related hospitality businesses.\nEpos Now provides many features that make running your hospitality business easier. For example, you can list all available rooms (and their prices) in your inventory, and customers can choose and pay for anyone. You can collect customer data during bookings and leverage this data to run personalized marketing campaigns.\nThe standard transaction fee when using Epos Now is 2.6% plus 10 cents. The subscription costs $39 monthly (on a one-year term) for software only and $79 monthly for Epos Now\u2019s hardware and software.\nEpos Now\u2019s hardware options are expensive, but a good thing is that it\u2019s compatible with external hardware systems. You can subscribe only to its software and buy hardware from other vendors. However, integrating external hardware with Epos Now is more complex than using the native hardware.\nApart from hospitality, Epos Now offers tailor-made features for retailers, restaurants, and service providers. It has a user-friendly interface that\u2019s simple to navigate.\nRead our full Epos Now review.\nBest POS for restaurants\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nToast offers the best POS system with sophisticated features if you run a restaurant. It\u2019s tailor-made for restaurant owners and provides crucial features you\u2019ll hardly find elsewhere.\nFor instance, you can create detailed restaurant menus in a few steps, specifying many variants for a product. You can get a Kitchen Display System (KDS) to automatically display all orders from the counter to your kitchen staff. This display system saves considerable time and prevents errors that often occur when orders are sent manually to kitchen staff.\nToast has direct integrations with food delivery apps like DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats. Hence, you can process delivery orders seamlessly within your payment system. Save for food delivery, I like that Toast offers a host of other integrations, ranging from customer loyalty apps to inventory and tax management tools.\nTransaction fees range from 2% to 2.75% plus 15 cents, and subscriptions start at $69 monthly. The drawback is that Toast requires customers to sign long-term contracts of 1 to 3 years instead of paying month to month. This limitation makes it suitable for large restaurants rather than small ones.\nRead our full Toast review.\nBest POS system for simplicity\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGoDaddy might be a surprising name to find in a buying guide about the best POS systems. It\u2019s most famous for offering domain name services, with a mixed reputation, but GoDaddy also offers a point-of-sale system for businesses.\nI chose GoDaddy POS because of its simplicity, flexibility, and reporting features. It doesn\u2019t offer the most sophisticated POS solution, but it provides something sufficient to accept and track payments. The checkout process feels smoother than most POS systems on this list.\nGoDaddy has advanced inventory management tools. You can keep stock counts and receive alerts when they fall below a specific threshold. Your inventory can be managed from the GoDaddy POS smartphone app or directly from the terminal.\nAlong with being a domain name registrar, GoDaddy also offers e-commerce tools for businesses. Its POS system is directly integrated with its e-commerce platform, making it convenient to sell online and in person. Your online and brick-and-mortar stores can share the same inventory; any transaction in either reflects on your dashboard.\nThe main drawback I observed is GoDaddy\u2019s limited customization. It\u2019s an affordable and simple solution for small and medium-sized enterprises, but it\u2019s not the best for larger retailers that rely on tailor-made features.\nRead our full GoDaddy review.\nBest POS for online retailers\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSquare is the best general-purpose system I tested. It strikes an ideal balance between pricing, features, integration, and ease of use. It doesn\u2019t offer as many features as some rivals, but it\u2019s a much more affordable solution. Unlike many competitors, Square charges no recurring monthly or annual subscriptions. You\u2019ll only pay transaction fees after buying the hardware.\nSquare is a simple POS solution that\u2019s suitable for small businesses. You can buy its portable card reader, plug it into your smartphone, and run your business from the Square mobile app. I appreciate that you don\u2019t need much money to set up and use Square.\nYet, if you need a more sophisticated solution, it\u2019s available. You can get the Square all-in-one Terminal, with everything running on the device instead of your smartphone. You can also choose the Square Register, an all-in-one solution for retail stores.\nSquare\u2019s versatility is its selling point. With a standard transaction fee of 2.6% plus 15 cents and broad hardware options, Square suits various business categories from stores to hotels, cafes, service providers, etc. However, I observed issues with scalability. Scaling from one Square POS system to multiple ones (tied to the same account) isn\u2019t as seamless as on other POS systems I tested.\nRead our full Square review.\nBest POS for customization\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLightspeed is a sophisticated, versatile POS system that offers custom solutions for various use cases, including convenience stores, hotels, restaurants, gas stations, and more.\nI chose Lightspeed because it\u2019s the most customizable POS solution I tested. You can customize product details, e.g., adding new fields like sizes and colors to your inventory. You can also modify product pages, checkout pages, fonts, and logos to fit perfectly with your brand. For instance, you can add form fields to collect customer data on the checkout page.\nIf you need a POS system tailored to your needs, Lightspeed is an excellent choice. It has broad features and extensive third-party integration to compensate for features Lightspeed may not offer. The user-friendly interface makes setting up and managing your payment system easy.\nThe drawback is that Lightspeed is relatively expensive, with monthly subscription fees costing $89 to $289. Its standard transaction fee is 2.6% plus 10 cents, which falls within a similar range as most POS systems.\nRead our full Lightspeed review.\nBest POS for small businesses\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nHelcim is a great option for small businesses because of its affordable hardware costs and transaction fees. It also doesn\u2019t require a monthly or annual subscription, which favors small businesses with limited budgets.\nTransaction fees on Helcim range from 1.8% to 2%, depending on the type of card. Its Smart Terminal hardware costs $329, unlike similar devices from other vendors that cost $500 upwards.\nHelcim has a visually stunning interface, and I don\u2019t say this lightly. Its interface is modern, highly responsive, and easily the best among the POS systems I\u2019ve tested. It incorporates bright, strategically positioned colors that make navigation fun.\nHowever, the tradeoff for Helcim\u2019s affordability is its limited customization and integration. You can\u2019t customize the checkout flow as much as a tool like Lightspeed or Shopify. It has a limited collection of native third-party integrations, so you might need a developer to create yours from scratch via Helcim\u2019s API.\nLikewise, Helcim doesn\u2019t offer as many complementary features as other POS systems on this list. It\u2019s a good POS system for small businesses but unsuitable for large retailers needing tailor-made features.\nRead our full Helcim review.\nBest POS system for value for money\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nI chose Clover because it offers great value for money. It\u2019s an affordable POS solution, and the features you\u2019ll get are worth the price. A basic POS setup costs $15 monthly (after buying the hardware). If you need tailor-made features for restaurants, Clover offers packages ranging from $60 to $90 monthly.\nThe standard transaction fee is 2.6% plus 10 cents, comparable to the other POS systems in this buying guide. You can manage your payments and inventory extensively with Clover.\nIf you have multiple POS devices, Clover lets you monitor them from a unified dashboard and simultaneously change settings across all devices. This easy monitoring favors spas, salons, convenience stores, and other businesses that often have multiple locations.\nClover\u2019s inventory management features are a bright spot. Its user-friendly interface makes it easy to create detailed product inventories and retrieve items when needed. Another bright spot is Clover\u2019s employee management features; you can manage shift requests and track clocked-in periods.\nOther complementary features include an invoicing solution, email marketing, and rapid deposit of customer payments (this service incurs a 1.75% fee). The drawback I observed is that Clover\u2019s hardware systems cost more than the competition.\nRead our full Clover review.\nAlso check out the following POS system reviews:\nLooking for more information on POS systems? Try these articles: Here we advise on how to choose a POS system; this feature explains how a POS system works; and in this article we demonstrate 5 ways POS systems help you manage staff.\nBest POS system FAQs\nIn today's fast moving digital world, your customers have a wide variety of options when it comes to purchasing goods and services. They can use credit and debit cards via magnetic swipe, chip or a contactless tap, Apple Pay and Google Pay via cell phone, third-party online payment providers, digital currencies like Bitcoin, or occasionally just plain old cash.\nWhat's more, people like using digital payment options. A recent study by Mastercard found that 50% of consumers globally prefer these new kinds of payments over cash - a trend that accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. With greater flexibility in your point of sale system, you can accept a wider variety of payments, speed up transactions, and improve overall customer satisfaction..\nTherefore, it just makes sense that any modern business should offer the payment options its customers want to use. No one wants to cancel a sale because a customer has to run to an ATM to withdraw cash. Chances are, they're not coming back.\nThese new digital payment-processing technologies can also be leveraged by businesses to better understand customer spending habits, manage inventories of all sizes, and offer practical services like on-floor payment processing and price checking.\nA modern POS system ties all this together and can do wonders for your front-end and back-end operations. We've compared these POS systems using various factors, including their ease of setup, interface, fee rate, support and pricing too. We also evaluated their learning curves, documentation, and hardware requirements, among other things.\nAfter the reviews, we've answered some of the most frequently asked questions about POS and ePOS systems.\nWhat is a POS system?\nA point-of-sale (POS) system is the hardware and software that allows businesses to process payments, manage inventory, and track sales.\nThe core hardware includes card readers or terminals that let customers pay by inserting, swiping, or tapping their cards. Complementary hardware includes receipt printers, barcode scanners, touchscreen displays, etc.\nThe software lets you receive payments from customers\u2019 cards. When you receive a payment, a receipt is automatically generated, which you can print with the receipt printer. The software also lets you manage inventory and generate sales reports.\nPOS systems take different forms: portable, countertop, and mobile. You can choose a portable POS device with built-in software to process payments. This option is best suited for service providers or businesses that often change locations, e.g., attending trade fairs.\nIf your business is at a fixed location, you can choose a countertop terminal to process payments. Countertop systems offer more features and a faster checkout process.\nIf you\u2019re a small business or service provider, you can buy a card reader that connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth or USB-C. The reader is the core hardware, and the software is the POS provider\u2019s app installed on your smartphone.\nThe POS market is very competitive, with a variety of systems designed for retailers, hotels, restaurants, and other business categories. In this buying guide, I curated the best POS systems for different categories.\nHow much does a business POS system cost?\nPrices vary significantly for POS systems. Businesses usually pay a monthly or annual fee for each POS device and a fee on every transaction. However, some POS systems, usually those targeted at small businesses, don\u2019t have subscription fees. They only take transaction fees.\nYou\u2019ll also need to pay for the core hardware, which ranges from $50 for small card readers to $1,000+ for countertop terminals. Likewise, complementary hardware like barcode scanners and receipt printers incur extra costs.\nPricing is crucial when choosing a POS system, especially for businesses with limited budgets. POS systems have varying price points, so there\u2019s no shortage of affordable solutions. Depending on your hardware and desired features, you can always find the best option at a reasonable price.\nBenefits of using a POS system\n1. Efficiency\nPOS systems let you efficiently accept customer payments. You type in the amount the customer should pay, and they can quickly insert, tap, or swipe their card to complete the payment.\nYou can add all items to your POS inventory and add unique barcodes. When a customer picks an item, you\u2019ll quickly scan the barcode to retrieve the price and other details. Your business runs more efficiently when these activities are done automatically rather than manually.\n2. Accurate reporting\nAccurate financial records are a pain point for businesses. Errors often occur when people manually input transaction records from one system to another.\nA POS system sidesteps this problem by automatically recording all transactions for future review. Transactions are recorded immediately after completion, so you\u2019ll get accurate records stretching back years or decades.\nYou can download accurate transaction data in a CSV format and export it to other software systems, such as your accounting and tax management platform. Some POS systems let you generate custom financial reports from transaction data.\n3. Customer experience\nA POS system provides an intuitive shopping experience for your customers. People can walk into your store, pick their items, and pay in a few steps. The POS system makes things seamless for you and the customer, boosting productivity and encouraging repeat sales.\nFactors to consider when choosing a POS system\n1. Type of business\nPOS systems are designed for different types of businesses. For example, Toast is built for restaurants, and Shopify is designed for retailers. Some systems, like GoDaddy, are intended for general-purpose businesses.\nConsider your business category when searching for suitable POS systems. You\u2019re better off with a solution designed for your business niche, though general-purpose solutions can still work.\nFor instance, Toast provides tailor-made features for restaurants that you\u2019ll hardly find in a general-purpose system. Shopify provides features for retailers that aren\u2019t easy to find in general POS solutions. It\u2019s advisable to select a solution designed for your niche, as it\u2019ll make running your business easier.\n2. Third-party integration\nEvaluate integration with third-party apps when choosing a POS system. A POS system won\u2019t offer all your desired features, but third-party tools can fill the gap. Third-party integration adds extra functionalities to your POS system and streamlines business operations.\nFor example, QuickBooks is a popular accounting tool for small businesses. Some POS systems are integrated with QuickBooks, so every transaction will automatically reflect in your accounting records. This integration saves considerable time you would have spent transferring these records manually.\nYou can use third-party integrations to manage discounts, customer loyalty programs, inventory, etc. The broader the integration library of your desired POS system, the better. If a POS system doesn\u2019t have many integrations, it should at least offer API access to let developers create custom integrations.\n3. Customer support\nCustomer support is essential beginning from the setup process. You might need help setting up your point-of-sale system, so a responsive and knowledgeable support team offers great benefits.\nPOS providers usually offer online or in-person assistance during setup, depending on your location. You should have access to online manuals and how-tos about setting up your POS system.\nAfter setting up your POS system, issues that require external help can occasionally arise. Hence, you should be able to contact your POS provider via email, telephone, or live chat to get quick responses. The faster and more knowledgeable the support team, the better.\nCustomer support was a core consideration when curating this buying guide. I tested each POS provider\u2019s customer support and weighed it against other pros and cons. I also researched third-party opinions about each POS provider's support services.\n4. Scalability\nIf you plan to run a fast-growing business, you need a POS system that can easily scale to meet your increasing needs. This factor may sound trivial, but I\u2019ve tested some POS systems that make scaling difficult.\nAdding a new POS device to your account and monitoring the transactions from your dashboard should be easy. Suppose you open a second store location; you should be able to order and set up a new device without hassle. Then, you can monitor transactions and make changes for both devices from your dashboard.\nFor example, many POS systems let you use the same inventory for multiple devices. If a sale is recorded in a device, it\u2019ll reflect on the inventory of all devices. You can also change settings for multiple POS devices from your dashboard. Scalability enables you to run a fast-growing business without running into mundane issues.\n5. Pricing\nPricing is essential when choosing your POS system. You need something within your budget, so compare options to make the best choice.\nPOS systems have wide price ranges, from less than $100 to thousands of dollars for the initial setup and recurring subscription fees. Choosing any vendor is a tradeoff between pricing and your desired features.\nA POS system might be the most affordable but lack your preferred features. In that case, you can forgo the preferred features and use the available ones. Alternatively, you can choose a more expensive option with the preferred features.\nThe good thing is that several POS systems are affordable and provide broad features. These systems offer great value for money, and I\u2019ve included some of them in this buying guide.\n6. User-friendliness\nA user-friendly interface is a key benefit of any POS system. It makes setting up and managing your POS system easy. With an intuitive interface, you can seamlessly switch between different features and juggle third-party integrations. User-friendliness was a priority when curating this guide to the best POS vendors.\nHow many POS terminals do I need?\nThis depends on the size of your business and your daily turnover. For smaller or medium-sized businesses that deal with lower volume, a single payment terminal is usually enough.\nRestaurants may want to invest in multiple handheld payment terminals (or use Apple or Android tablets) to enable payments to be taken at tables by serving staff.\nFor medium-sized businesses dealing with high volume and for larger companies, two or three terminals will be ideal. The best solution is to start with one or two based on your volume and scale up as needed.\nAre all POS systems PCI compliant?\nWhile most, if not all, POS systems are PCI compliant, simply using one doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t have to worry about other components of your payment ecosystem. Opting for a POS that manages more details can help streamline the process, but it may be more costly.\nRead our article about PCI compliance to learn more.\nWhat is an mPOS system?\nPOS systems have evolved to become more flexible, so they work on many devices. For example, with nothing but a smartphone and mobile card reader, you can manage payments, refunds, and more.\nMobile point of sale solutions (often called mPOS systems) are especially useful for small businesses and those without a fixed address, like food trucks and personal trainers. But they also represent a great opportunity for fixed businesses looking to leverage pop-up stores, kiosks, and mobile storefronts.\nFor more info, read our article about the best mobile credit card processors.\nWhat is a tablet POS system?\nToday's POS systems are built to work on iPads and Android tablets, which gives you greater flexibility and mobility when securing customer payments.\nYou can choose to have them fixed in place with a stand or to keep them on your person to serve customers, which is a great option for a restaurant or bar.\nTablet POS systems are often the easiest POS devices to use as well, as they\u2019ve been simplified for easier handling on a tablet. You get all the movement benefits of a mobile POS system with a wider screen and more storage space.\nWhat can a modern POS system do for your business?\nProduct Reports\nProduct reporting will help you better manage your stock and find opportunities for growth. Target poorly performing products for improvement or removal, and enact campaigns for the most popular ones.\nUser accounts and permissions\nYour staff doesn\u2019t need access to everything. A POS system with user accounts and most importantly, permission settings will enable employees to perform their duties without you having to worry about them stumbling onto sensitive information.\nMobile features\nMobile hardware, Android and iOS applications, and handy mobile features like bill splitting, Apple and Google Pay compatibility, and receipt emailing can all make it easier for mobile and small businesses to satisfy customers and increase turnover.\nCustomer facing display\nFor retail businesses, this is considered indispensable, and there are many options out there. Modern customer-facing screens are a great opportunity to inform customers and promote campaigns, all while providing a smooth and transparent transaction experience\nCustomer Relationship Management\nAn umbrella term for a host of features and functionalities, CRM enables you to build better and more productive relationships with customers. Contact details and payment history, for example, can be used to keep customers informed of new products that may interest them.\nEmployee tracking and reporting\nStreamline your daily operations with built-in employee clock-in and clock-out capabilities, and find opportunities for employee growth with reporting. Reward high performers and enact training when necessary.\nStock management\nA good stock management system can help you save costs and streamline operations. Many POS support multi-location stock management, enabling you to more quickly respond to stock problems or respond to customer requests.\nLoyalty programmes\nIncluded in CRM but still worthy of mention are loyalty programs, which many businesses have used with great success to boost sales and maintain customer involvement. A POS with strong loyalty program capabilities, as well as the ability to process gift cards, can be well worth the money.\nBulk operations\nGetting started with a new POS doesn\u2019t have to be a headache. POS systems that support bulk operations through CSV import, for example, or integration with third-party apps, will greatly simplify the process.\nThese features make it easier to turn impatient customers into enthusiastic ambassadors for your brand. A good POS can facilitate SRM by streamlining these processes.\nIf you're looking for advice about POS systems for specific type of business, then take a look at our guides to choosing the best POS systems for small business, POS systems for restaurants, and POS systems for retail.\nHow to choose the best POS systems for you?\nWhen deciding which POS system to use, first consider what your actual needs are, as different platforms can offer differing features fee rates. Additionally, you may need a POS with specific tools for your business, so make sure you look carefully at both features and costs to ensure you can get the POS system your business needs.\nThe best POS systems for business compared\nPOS system | Lowest monthly fee | Card rates | Free trial | Support |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\nAirPOS | $29.99 | Integrates with iZettle, SumUp, and WorldPay | 14 days | Online form |\nLightspeed | \u00a369 | 2.6% + 10\u00a2 | 14 days | 24-hr phone support (reduced weekend hours) |\nShopify | $29 | 2.7% | 14 days | 24/7 chat support |\n$39 | Integrates with iZettle and others | 30 days | Email support (Pro: 24/7 phone support) | |\n$0 | 2.6% + 10\u00a2 | N/A | Phone and chat support | |\n$69 | Varies, depending on payment provider | Demo sign-up available | Phone, email, help page |\nHow we tested the best POS systems\nWe reviewed many different POS systems before deciding on which to feature in this guide.

      "text": "Best ransomware protection of 2025\nFree and paid decryption tools\nThe best ransomware protection helps protect against the threat of hackers breaching your networks or device, and then encrypting your data before forcing you to pay for a decryption key or face losing your files forever.\nThere are many motivations behind ransomware attacks - the most prominent reason being money. Threat actors will also perform ransomware attacks to steal secrets, disrupt businesses, or just because they can.\nOur experts have written about all of the biggest ransowmare attacks, and have spent years testing the best ransomware protection services. They what the difference is between a good service and a bad service, whether its device and platform compatibility, encryption protections, backup options, or ease of use and value for money.\nBitdefender holds the top spot for best ransomware protection thanks to its comprehensive coverage against common and niche attack vectors and high detection rates. AVG ranks at number two on our list for its easy configuration, and Avast takes third place for its lightweight protection that doesn't hamper performance.\nWe've also listed the best encryption software.\nStop threats before they escalate\nAttackers don\u2019t wait. Neither should your business. NordLayer\u2019s Threat Protection prevents cyber threats early with DNS filtering, real-time download scanning, and Deep Packet Inspection\u2014ensuring secure access and uninterrupted operations. Start securing your business now and save up to 22%.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nThe best ransomware protection of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest ransomware protection overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGet a 50-60% discount on Bitdefender Antivirus Plus\nTechRadar's #1 rated antivirus in a world packed with loads of virus protection providers, and doesn't even cost that much more than free antivirus downloads.\nOne at any rankings of big independent antivirus, and you\u2019ll see that Bitdefender's premium security products always rise to the top.\nBidefender Antivirus Plus is reliable and accurate in its virus detecting, boasting web and URL filtering to block access to malicious sites, as well as a secure browser that keeps your online banking and shopping transactions safe. Plus, there's a password manager which auto-completes credit card details in web forms - although if you require more advanced features, you'll probably want the best password manager. It also scores high for its excellent anti-phishing module, which alerts you to malicious links in your search engine results and blocks access to dangerous sites.\nThat\u2019s not all: of course, there's also the multi-layer ransomware protection that heuristically learns the behavior of such threats to keep you safe as well as the ability to scan all your linked devices via the Bitdefender Central mobile app.\nThere are one or two issues \u2013 it grabs more resources than average, and might conflict with some programs \u2013 but Bitdefender Antivirus Plus is still a likeable package which offers excellent detection rates, great performance, and more than enough bonus features to justify the price.\nBitdefender Internet Security builds on AVP and triples the number of devices covered plus offers anti-spam, firewall, parental advisor and file encryption features.\nFor a little bit more you can purchase the Bitdefender Total Security edition. It adds all of the above and covers up to five PCs, Macs, Android and iOS devices.\nProtect your devices with our Bitdefender promo codes. Get top-notch cybersecurity at a discounted price and keep your online activities safe.\nRead our full Bitdefender Antivirus Plus review.\nBest ransomware protection for remote scanning\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're looking for ransomware protection that keeps quiet and won't disturb your work, be warned \u2013 AVG Antivirus Free is quite vocal with its notifications, and irks us from time to time with pop-ups telling us we've done something fantastic with regard to our online security.\nAs a ransomware shield and anti-malware app, though, it's very good. The dashboard is user-friendly, there's protection not just from downloadable threats, but from dodgy links too, and you can use your mobile to scan your PC remotely, which is pretty clever.\nAlthough the free version offers basic antivirus protection, you really need to upgrade to the paid version to get the full-featured protection against ransomware, as well as additional security software protections such as data encryption options as well as a firewall.\nRead our full AVG Antivirus Free review.\nBest ransomware protection for multiple device protection\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAvast Antivirus is one of the most competent internet protection suites out there. While the company is famous for providing free antivirus software, it's worth noting that this now comes bundled with an anti-malware feature that uses behavioral monitoring to spot rogue programs.\nWhat's even better is that not only are Avast's basic products free, but they are also available for mobile devices as well as for desktops, which makes Avast a particular ideal choice if you have multiple devices you need to check.\nEven better is that ransomware protection is included in the free version of the Avast Antivirus platform, so you don't even need to pay to upgrade for this, though additional security features are available if you do.\nFor business users, there are paid-for internet security options to cover a range of needs and options.\nRead our full Avast Antivirus review.\nBest ransomware protection for a lightweight solution\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nJust about every antivirus tool claims to be \u2018lightweight\u2019, but Webroot Antivirus is really the only one to deliver on this front. Installation takes seconds, the program files barely use 2MB of your hard drive, RAM footprint is tiny, and there are no bulky signature updates to tie up your bandwidth.\nConsidering this, there's no compromise on features, which makes it all the more impressive. Along with the core protection, there's smart behavior monitoring, accurate real-time anti-phishing, a firewall and network connection monitor, enhanced anti-ransomware, and other interesting bonuses.\nIt's not easy to compare Webroot's accuracy with the competition, as the big testing labs rarely evaluate the company's products. However, when they are reviewed, they generally score high, and our own tests show solid and reliable protection.\nFeatures include always-on security, identity protection, real-time anti-phishing, firewall monitor.\nRead our full Webroot Antivirus review.\nFind the best deals on Webroot products with our Webroot promo codes.\nBest ransomware protection for experts\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you judge antivirus software on the length of its feature list, ESET NOD32 Antivirus might be a bit of a disappointment. There\u2019s no firewall, password manager, file shredder, vulnerability scanner or any of the bundled bonuses you'll often find in its rivals.\nThis doesn't mean the package is short on power, however. It's just more focused on the fundamentals. ESET NOD32 Antivirus comes with real-time malware protection, some of the best heuristic detection around, an anti-ransomware layer, exploit protection, URL filtering to block malicious websites, and modules to prevent attacks using PowerShell and malicious scripts.\nA Device Control module limits the risk of infection from other devices by controlling access to USB sticks, external hard drives, optical storage media, even devices connecting by Bluetooth and FireWire. It's an unusual addition, but could make a difference if others are regularly plugging devices into your PC.\nJust bear in mind that ESET NOD32 Antivirus isn't aimed at beginners. The interface is clumsy sometimes, some features are very advanced, and even the Help isn't always helpful.\nExperienced users will appreciate ESET\u2019s power and configurability, however. Above-average protection does a good job of keeping you safe, and a lightweight design ensures the package won't slow you down.\nESET Internet Security builds on NOD 32 and triples the number of devices covered plus offers firewall, botnet protection, webcam protection, antispam and more. Alternatively, you can purchase the ESET Smart Security Premium edition for not much more. It adds all of the above as well as password management and secure data.\nRead our full ESET NOD32 Antivirus review.\nBest ransomware removal software\nThe best malware removal software available right now is: Malwarebytes Premium\nIf you're suffering from a malware infection and free software isn't getting the job done, Malwarebytes Premium could be the silver bullet you need. It uses heuristic analysis to identify new strains of malware, cleans up existing infections, helps protect you from phishing scams, and helps stop you downloading further malicious software in the future, including ransomware.\nBest ransomware removal software overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you have a ransomware infection, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware should be your first port of call. It\u2019s updated daily, so you can trust it to identify and remove new threats the minute they appear.\nThe first time you install Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, you\u2019re given a 14-day trial of the premium edition, which includes preventative tools like real-time scanning and specific protection from ransomware. After two weeks, it reverts to the basic free version. This has to be activated manually, but is still a top-notch security tool. We recommend running it at least once a week to check or any nasties that you haven't noticed, or if you notice that your web browser has suddenly started acting strangely (likely a result of adware).\nRecently, Malwarebytes bought Adwcleaner, which \u2013 as its name suggests \u2013 targets and removes annoying programs that hijack your browser by changing your homepage, resetting your default search engine, or adding unwanted toolbars. It\u2019s also available free, and along with Anti-Malware, is a great addition to your security toolkit.\nRead our full Malwarebytes Anti-Malware review.\nBest free ransomware removal software\n2. Avast Free Ransomware Decryption Tools\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNot all ransomware encrypts data in the same way, so security software providers have to create specific solutions as new threats emerge. At the time of writing, the security experts at Avast have developed Free Ransomware Decryption Tools to tackle 21 different strains of file-locking ransomware.\nTo help you work out which one you need, Avast has provided a detailed description of how each form of ransomware works, what extension you\u2019ll see on the encrypted files, and an example of the type of message the virus creators have prepared for their victims.\nOnce you\u2019ve downloaded the appropriate tool, it will guide you through the process of wiping out the ransomware without paying the criminals. You\u2019ll need to provide two versions of the same file \u2013 an encrypted one, and the original.\nThis will be easiest if you made a backup before the infection, but Avast also suggests locations where you might be able to find unaffected original files. The tool will then compare the two and use the results to determine the password.\nWe've listed the best endpoint protection software.\nBest ransomware protection FAQs\nWhat is ransomware?\nAdam Kujawa, Director of Malwarebytes Labs:\n\u201cThe term malware, or \u2018malicious software,\u2019 is an umbrella term that describes any malicious program or code that is harmful to systems, including ransomware. Hostile, intrusive, and intentionally nasty, malware seeks to invade, damage, or disable computers, computer systems, networks, tablets, and mobile devices, often by taking partial control over a device\u2019s operations. Like the human flu, it interferes with normal functioning. The motives behind malware vary - it can be about making money off you, sabotaging your ability to get work done, making a political statement, or just bragging rights.\"\nHow to choose the best ransomware protection for you?\nWhen deciding which ransomware protection to use, first consider what your actual needs are, as budget software may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a more expensive platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, higher-end software can usually cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require from your ransomware protection.\nHow we test\nTo test for the best ransomware protection we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, then we tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each ransomware protection platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nWe've also rated the best identity management software.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

Now, the best CRM platforms seamlessly integrate across almost every area of business, helping you track customer interaction, streamline processes, and boost sales.\nI\u2019m the CRM Editor here at TechRadar and together with my team of expert reviewers we have spent hundreds of hours getting to grips more than 30 of the best CRMs on the market, talking with key executives in the top CRM companies, and keeping a close eye on the latest trends within the CRM space.

Prices start at $25/user/mo for SMB users, so it\u2019s affordable, but additional and specialist tools can dramatically increase costs.\nReader Offer: 30-day free trial\nSalesforce's CRM software helps businesses maximize customer data with features like lead scoring, omnichannel routing (which directs customer inquiries to the right agent across multiple channels), advanced pipeline management, and deal health insights.

He has now been the Editor in charge of all things CRM at TechRadar for over 10 months and has a passion for offering experience backed advice on which CRM is best for you.\nMy top 3 best CRMs\nBest CRM for most businesses, in most cases: Salesforce\nSalesforce is a global CRM leader that offers advanced, customizable tools with a user-friendly interface and impressive reporting capabilities. While comparable to competitors like Zoho CRM, Salesforce's upper-tier plans justify their higher cost with features like Workflow Automation and advanced reporting. With intuitive customization options and robust support resources, Salesforce empowers teams to streamline workflows and boost productivity.\nBest CRM for midsize businesses: Workbooks\nWorkbooks offers comprehensive CRM solutions tailored for midsize businesses, covering customer service, sales, marketing, and operations. Its standout feature is the Shared Success program, providing clients with free consulting hours and annual workshops for continuous alignment with business goals. While the free version is restricted to two users and lacks advanced features, paid tiers offer a greater level of flexibility.\nBest CRM for free: HubSpot\nHubSpot CRM stands out with its free plan, offering comprehensive features like contact management, call and email logs, and integrations with popular apps. It also includes advanced functionalities like email scheduling and Facebook Messenger integration. Needless to say, a free plan with so much power makes it ideal for cash-strapped startups or small businesses with a limited budget.\nPaid plans unlock additional capabilities from HubSpot's Marketing, Sales, and Service Hubs, allowing seamless integration across platforms.\nThe best CRM software of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest CRM software overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSalesforce is a global leader in CRM, with advanced, customizable functionality, user-friendly design, and outstanding reporting tools. The company proudly states on its website that \u201c98% of customers meet or exceed their ROI goals,\u201d which is seriously impressive.\nFeatures\nThe core CRM platform is Salesforce Sales Cloud, which can be integrated with Marketing Cloud for email automation or with Einstein Analytics for AI-powered business intelligence, among others.\nIn use, Salesforce Sales Cloud is intuitive and focuses on getting your leads over the line, but you can customize a significant part of your interface to suit your team\u2019s needs, from dashboards to reports and contact forms.\nThe support requires a login to connect directly. I did find the sales number in multiple places, but not any support number or email, giving us pause on any potential difficulty for direct communication should the need arise. Furthermore, there is a help area of the website with self-help content via a searchable database.\nHigher-level plan features include Workflow Approval and Automation, which can automate standard business processes, and Sales Teams that can designate the members of the team to work on the individual deal.\nFurthermore, on top of pipeline management, call and email logs, and customizable contact management, Enterprise plans and above include advanced reporting and prediction, app development, full sandbox, sophisticated process automations, and external system integrations via web services APIs.\nIn large organizations, the app development and sandbox features can help make teams even more productive by customizing permissions and workflows across territories, customer verticals, and sales funnel stages.\nPricing and plans\nWith so many different options and modules to consider, summarizing Salesforce pricing can be tricky. The core plan (Salesforce Sales Cloud) is broken into two pricing structures targeted at SMBs and enterprises.\nSMB pricing starts at $25/user/month, which gives you access to a simple CRM suite. If you want access to an enhanced CRM suite with more sales, marketing, and commerce tools, you'll need to upgrade to the Pro Suite plan at $100/user/month.\nEnterprise users have access to three plans. The first 'Enterprise' plan costs $165/user/month and offers more flexibility and Web API. Upgrade to the 'Unlimited' plan at $330/user/month, and you get intelligent automation and developer support built in. Finally, go for the 'Einstein 1 Sales' plan at $500/user/month, and you get everything from the 'Unlimited' plan plus Einstein Copilot Powered by Generative AI.\nAlternatives\nAlthough Salesforce is the best for most businesses, in some cases, it isn\u2019t necessarily the right fit. For example, if cash-strapped businesses are looking for the best CRM for startups, Salesforce can be expensive. HubSpot is a great alternative in this case, offering plenty of functionality on its free plan.\nSupport\nSalesforce offers 24/7 support through multiple channels, including phone, email, and live chat. Their extensive knowledge base and active community forums provide additional resources. However, the quality of support can vary depending on your plan level.\nMy verdict\nThe cost of Salesforce can get expensive on the upper tiers, considering that it is billed per each individual user. While there is also no free tier, I do appreciate the 30-day free trial that is available without a credit card, and does not require any software download. Another benefit is that the pricing is upfront, transparent, with a long list of features designated by the plan for ease of comparison.\nRead our full Salesforce CRM review\nBest CRM software for midsize businesses\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWorkbooks is an excellent CRM for midsize businesses, offering solutions for customer service, sales, marketing, and operations teams.\nFeatures\nIts primary differentiator is its Shared Success program, which gives customers access to free consulting hours, along with annual workshops to ensure that Workbooks continues to align with a client's business goals.\nWorkbooks lacks a diverse third-party app marketplace or developer community, unlike competitors such as Salesforce and HubSpot. Therefore, it might not be the best choice for users who require a large number of third-party customizations.\nIn addition, its free version is limited to only two users and has fewer features, which could make it less appealing to very small businesses. It also requires a business email, along with a phone number to sign up, but it does not require a credit card.\nPricing and plans\nPlans are broken into 3 tiers. The entry 'CRM' plan costs $43/user/month and offers all the basic CRM features you would expect. Upgrade to the 'Business' plan for $88/user/month and you'll get extra features including sales order management, supplier purchase orders, and invoice/credit notes. The 'Events' plan starts at $183/user/month and offers event-specific features such as ticket sales and sponsorships, online event registration, and check-ins.\nIt is important to note that the prices mentioned above are just starting prices, with each option coming with a host of optional extras at an additional cost.\nAlternatives\nIf Workbooks\u2019 2-person free plan limit is an issue for you, HubSpot may be a more suitable option. For more advanced functionality, you may also want to consider Salesforce, but do remember that if you go down that route, you\u2019ll likely end up paying significantly more.\nSupport\nHaving had the opportunity to speak to several of Workbooks\u2019 long-term customers in person, one key theme became clear - willingness to collaborate. According to its customers, Workbooks is proactive in helping them get the most out of the CRM platform. This is through a combination of training courses and consultations with the Workbooks team, which are built into the onboarding process.\nOther CRM platforms certainly provide similar services, but usually at a (sometimes substantial) additional cost.\nOnce Workbooks is rolled out across your company, you'll receive exceptional customer support with personalized assistance and a hands-on approach to implementation. Their team of experts offers guidance throughout the onboarding process and beyond, ensuring you maximize the platform's potential for your business.\nMy verdict\nI note the lack of a volume discount for multiple users, and also the inflexibility in pricing, as the only option is to pay annually, while other services offer a month-to-month price with an annual discount.\nI like the 30-day free trial, but keep in mind that there are a myriad of additional features available, each with a monthly cost that means with several chosen, the cost can add up quickly. These additional cost features include multilingual, multi-currency, web analytics and intelligence, and audit trail, among many others.\nOverall, I think Workbooks is a fantastic CRM platform when used for its intended purpose - providing CRM software solutions to midsize organizations.\nRead our full Workbooks review.\nBest free CRM plan\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nHubSpot is easily one of the best CRM platforms on the market, but what makes it really stand out from the crowd is its generous free plan, offering startups, entrepreneurs, and small businesses a cost-free way to roll out a CRM during their fledgling days. Simply put, it's among the best free CRM software on the market.\nFeatures\nWhile several CRM providers offer free plans, none are as functional as the one from HubSpot CRM. The basics are well covered, including contact management, call and email logs, deal pipeline, and integrations with apps, including Slack and Gmail. It even includes email scheduling and Facebook Messenger integration-features that I rarely see at this level.\nOn paid plans, the core CRM is enriched with features from HubSpot\u2019s Marketing, Sales, and Service Hubs, which then integrate nicely across these different offerings. With the marketing functionality, you can generate pop-up forms, chatbots, and ad retargeting on your website, as well as automate and track email campaigns. Premium sales features include deal assignment automation, customizable reports, and intelligent lead scoring to help focus your team\u2019s efforts.\nThe biggest obstacle is that the contacts you can market to - for example, via bulk emails or ads - are limited to 2,000 on all plans apart from Enterprise, which has a limit of 10,000. However, you can store and track up to 1 million prospects.\nPricing and plans\nWhile enviable, HubSpot\u2019s combined sales and marketing functionality comes with a steep price. Moving up from the free tier gets us to the Professional tier at a cost of $450/month. While it does support 5 users at that price, has a product library and forecasting, and supports eSignatures, that price point may be a barrier for smaller businesses. I feel it is a missed opportunity that there are no additional tiers of plans to choose from, with an appropriately lower price of entry.\nAlternatives\nHubSpot is the best option for most startups, as it offers plenty for free, but also allows you to unlock functionality as you go. However, if you are on the free plan and find yourself with questions, it can be tricky to get them answered. Workbooks offer an excellent level of support and are well worth considering as an alternative.\nSupport\nHubSpot offers a range of support options, including 24/7 phone and email support for paid plans. Their extensive knowledge base, community forums, and HubSpot Academy provide valuable self-help resources. However, the live support quality can vary.\nMy verdict\nHubSpot is an easy-to-use CRM with loads of features and integrations. The free plan is very generous and a perfect option for startups. The major downside is the big leap in paid plans, going from free to relatively expensive right away - which is something startups should be aware of when considering their future needs.\nRead our full HubSpot CRM review.\nBest CRM software for small business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFreshsales works best for small to medium businesses that prioritize ease of use over advanced customization.\nFeatures\nIts desktop and mobile interface is highly intuitive, including quick access to contact records and communications, and drag-and-drop Kanban-style boards for sales pipeline management. Its intelligent assistant tool, Freddy AI, can also help suggest which deals to close and how if you give it sufficient historical data to work with.\nIts main focus is on sales team productivity and deal closure. You can integrate your email client - including Microsoft Outlook and Gmail - into the software, enabling you to create email templates, send bulk emails to prospects, and log incoming and outgoing messages. It is also designed to integrate with other tools, including PayPal, DocuSign, Slack and Intuit QuickBooks, for a streamlined workflow.\nFurthermore, there\u2019s an in-built calling tool with a recording feature that automatically updates customer communication records. I also like that when it comes to support, there is a toll-free number, along with a direct email for getting directly in touch should the need arise for some help.\nFreshsales CRM is limited in terms of lead generation tools, such as business card scanners. It does, however, feature customizable web forms, capturing lead data from your website and automatically assigning sales leads. Other features include several thousand Bot sessions per month, depending on the plan, a visual sales pipeline, and Contact Lifestyle management.\nPricing and plans\nThere are four plans: a free tier, and three paid tiers. The free tier, while it has its limits, does still have 24/5 support, along with a mobile app. Paid tiers (Growth ($9/user/month), Pro ($39/user/mo), and Enterprise ($59/user/mo) progressively add more features up to the top Enterprise plan with a dedicated account manager, audit logs, and AI-based forecasting insights.\nAlternatives\nIf you want to generate leads with FreshBooks, you\u2019ll have to opt for a pricey enterprise-level plan. Platforms such as Zoho and HubSpot offer more out of the box in this area.\nSupport\nFreshsales provides 24/5 email and phone support, with 24/7 support available on higher-tier plans. Their knowledge base and community forums offer additional assistance. However, response times can be inconsistent, especially for lower-tier plans.\nMy verdict\nFreshsales offers small businesses all the tools they need to track and manage customer relationships. Compared to other big players like Salesforce, Freshsales is also refreshingly affordable, making it a more viable CRM for small businesses.\nRead our full Freshsales review to learn more about the sales-focused CRM; our Freshdesk review to find out about its customer engagement CRM; our Freshmarketer review to learn about the marketing CRM element; and Freshservice to discover its IT support CRM.\nBest CRM software for project management\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMonday.com is a dedicated project management system designed to give you a flexible and transparent way to organize your work.\nFeatures\nWith a highly visual scheduling interface and customizable workflows, Monday.com adapts to the unique way members of your team approach their projects. It focuses on keeping things simple and easy, offering all the features you would expect from a CRM such as email management, performance tracking, automations, data organization, and more.\nPlans and pricing\nThere are four different levels of Monday.com membership: Basic($12/user/month) , Standard ($17/user/month), Pro ($28/user/month), and Enterprise (custom pricing).\nPrices vary depending on the number of user accounts you require, with the cheapest memberships only allowing you to add two users and top-end options supporting more than 200 accounts.\nAlternatives\nMonday.com is easy to set up, but does take some time to get to grips with. If you want a CRM platform that you can get started with quickly, I suggest checking out HubSpot.\nSupport\nMonday.com offers 24/7 support via email and chat, with phone support available on higher-tier plans. Their knowledge base and community forums provide additional resources. Users generally report positive experiences with support responsiveness and quality.\nMy verdict\nMonday.com is the ideal project management tool for anyone looking for an accessible system that their team will actually use. Unfortunately, some important features, like calendar views, are only available with its more expensive subscriptions. All the same, Monday.com stands out for its slick design and adaptable third-party integrations.\nRead our full Monday.com review.\nBest CRM software for business tool integration\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nZoho is a powerhouse of business software and its CRM platform is a great option for those who already own some of the other great platforms from the company.\nFeatures\nZoho CRM does all the basics well - contact and pipeline management, communications tracking, workflow automation, and reporting. Further improving its reputation is that it is trusted by about 250,000 businesses worldwide, such as Suzuki, Bose and Purolite.\nBut its added value is in integrating with other apps from the Zoho sales, marketing, and project management suite, including Zoho Invoice and Zoho Campaigns, which can input valuable prospect data into your pipeline. Moreover, Zoho CRM can scrape contact details from social networks and scan business cards, making it a powerful lead-generation system.\nIn use, the product is highly customizable: you can add fields to contact records, create lead assignment rules, and even personalize the look and feel of your CRM interface to maximize internal usage. Reporting and analytics features are also strong, including customizable performance reports and visualization tools.\nPricing and plans\nUnfortunately, there is no free tier, but there is a free trial that can last for 15 days. While it does not require a credit card, it does need a work email and phone number, and any of the tiers can be tried.\nThe entry-level plan, known as Standard ($14/user/month), features advanced functionality with multiple currencies, advanced filters, sales forecasting, and multiple pipelines. On higher tiers, the Enterprise ($40/user/month) and Ultimate ($53/user/month) plans, you get the Zia AI feature, which recommends what leads to focus on and what emails to write, as well as how to assign workflow.\nThere is also flexibility in payment, whether month to month or alternatively for a discount, annually.\nAlternatives\nZoho focuses on integrating its CRM with its wider offering of applications. That\u2019s great if you want to use the full Zoho suite of tools, but for others, it can be limiting. Platforms such as Salesforce offer a greater range of flexibility through app marketplaces.\nSupport\nZoho provides email and phone support, with response times varying based on your plan. Their knowledge base and community forums offer additional assistance. However, some users report inconsistent support quality and slow response times for complex issues.\nMy verdict\nZoho offers a whole host of powerful business tools at reasonable prices. If you are using other Zoho tools, opting for the Zoho CRM is an easy decision to make. But even as a standalone platform, this CRM is well worth considering.\nRead our full Zoho CRM review.\nBest CRM software for user experience\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPipedrive is a cloud-based CRM tool that\u2019s younger than many on this list; it was founded in 2010. Yet, in a relatively short while, it has amassed a user base of over 100,000 businesses around the globe. The platform boasts of being \u201cdesigned by salespeople, for salespeople\u201d.\nFeatures\nPipedrive makes it easy to set up a sales pipeline for your products and services and follow up on different steps of the pipeline to close a sale. You can create the stages for your pipeline by yourself or use an existing template to make it easier. You can add deals or import them from a spreadsheet or from an external CRM into the pipeline.\nIf you\u2019re dealing with many leads, you'll like that Pipedrive lets you set automatic alerts and reminders to ensure you're on top of your deals. You can also update your sales forecast each time you progress through a deal to reflect your organization's expectation for increased sales.\nA unique thing about Pipedrive is that it incorporates artificial intelligence (AI). There\u2019s a built-in AI tool, Sales Assistant, that helps you decide what to do to close your deals and automate mundane tasks. For example, the assistant can analyze your sales actions and suggest methods to make your workflow smoother. It can track email opens and community discussions and give you activity reminders to keep you attuned to your deals.\nPricing and plans\nA major drawback of using Pipedrive is that there\u2019s no free version. However, you can take advantage of the 14-day free trial period to test its features before making your final purchase decision. Besides, Pipedrive is one of the most affordable CRM tools, starting at just $10 per user per month, compared to a rival like Salesforce which starts at $25 for the same period.\nAlternatives\nPipedrive is a great CRM but it lacks options when it comes to extra features. Opting for a platform like HubSpot or Zoho makes it easy to integrate with wider business tools such as email marketing and project management.\nSupport\nPipedrive offers 24/7 chat and email support, with phone support available on higher-tier plans. Their knowledge base and community forums provide additional resources. Users generally report positive experiences with support quality, though response times can vary.\nMy verdict\nIf you are looking for a CRM that is easy to get to grips with, Pipedrive might be the best option for you. It also plays a strong hand when it comes to pricing, offering entry-level plans at a much lower price than many competitors.\nRead our full Pipedrive CRM review.\nBest CRM for ease of use\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nZendesk Sell offers a user-friendly CRM solution ideal for small to medium businesses, with strong integration with Zendesk's customer support platform. It delivers a well-rounded CRM experience with a focus on usability and integration with Zendesk's renowned support tools.\nFeatures\nZendesk Sell provides a centralized customer database that allows users to access and update contact details, interaction history, and account-specific data. The platform offers customizable sales pipelines, enabling users to adjust stages to fit their specific sales process. I found the interface for moving deals through stages to be intuitive, making it easy to visualize progress and identify potential bottlenecks.\nThe CRM includes forecasting tools that help sales managers estimate deal volume and revenue growth. During my evaluation, I was able to generate accurate forecasts using sample historical data and current pipeline status. While these features work well, I've seen more advanced predictive analytics in other CRMs.\nZendesk Sell provides 20 pre-built charts, reports, and dashboards for insights into key sales metrics. Users can also create custom reports using a drag-and-drop interface. This functionality allows for analyzing trends by region or team and predicting revenue growth, which adds significant value for sales managers.\nI appreciated how the CRM integrates with popular communication tools. Zendesk works smoothly with email clients like Gmail and Outlook, automatically logging email communications. This integration saves time and ensures all customer interactions are captured within the CRM, offering a complete view of customer relationships.\nPricing and plans\nZendesk Sell employs a tiered pricing model with four plans tailored for various business sizes and needs. The entry-level Team plan costs $19 per user each month with annual billing. The Growth plan is priced at $55 per user per month, the Professional plan at $115 per user per month, and the Enterprise plan begins at $169 per user per month with annual billing.\nEach tier progressively adds more features, with higher plans offering advanced tools like lead and deal scoring, task automation, and advanced permissions. Zendesk offers a 15% discount for annual billing compared to monthly billing, which can lead to substantial savings for larger teams.\nAlternatives\nIf Zendesk Sell's price is a concern for your business, HubSpot offers a generous free plan that might be worth considering. For more advanced functionality, especially in terms of customization, SugarCRM could be a suitable alternative.\nSupport\nZendesk offers 24/7 support through multiple channels, including email, chat, and phone for higher-tier plans. The extensive knowledge base and community forums provide additional resources. However, the quality of support can vary depending on your plan level.\nMy verdict\nZendesk Sell is a strong and user-friendly option that balances essential features with ease of use. Its seamless integration with Zendesk's support platform makes it particularly attractive for businesses already using Zendesk for customer service.\nHowever, the pricing structure may be steep for very small businesses or startups, and some users might find certain advanced features lacking compared to more established enterprise solutions.\nBest CRM software for simple pricing\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nKeap is not your typical CRM software. Its combined set of features blurs the line between sales and marketing, with native payments, appointment booking, and email marketing functionality built on top of a core contact and pipeline management system.\nBest of all it keeps its pricing simple, which can be a relief for those looking to find a great CRM platform without all the hassle of navigating complex plans.\nFeatures\nKeap helps you convert leads through advanced marketing campaigns and save time through workflow automations and payment integration. Features include lead & Client management, sales pipeline, and analysis, text marketing, and email marketing. A straightforward interface and generous support options make Keap highly accessible even for the most novice CRM users.\nPricing and plans\nUnfortunately, Keap does not have a free tier, and while there is an offer of a free trial, it is limited to only 14 days, which is shorter than some of its competitors.\nKeap keeps it simple with pricing and totally abolishes feature-based plans. Pricing is based on the number of users and contacts you have, starting at $249/month for 2 users and up to 1500 contacts.\nAlternatives\nWith prices starting from $249/mo for two users and up to 1500 contacts, Keap certainly isn\u2019t the cheapest option on this list, making it a poor choice for most small and start-up businesses. If Keap\u2019s price is just too much, look to HubSpot for a generous free plan or Monday.com for a budget-friendly plan starting at $12/seat/mo.\nSupport\nKeap offers phone, chat, and email support, with response times varying based on your plan. Their knowledge base and community forums provide additional resources. However, some users report difficulties with account cancellation and billing issues.\nMy verdict\nWith Keap, you can get started straight away and reap benefits from email campaigns and automated triggers without a huge learning curve.\nRead our full Keap review.\nBest for manufacturing businesses\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSugarCRM offers a comprehensive, customizable platform with strong AI capabilities for sales, marketing, and customer service. It stands out with its extensive customization options, cross-functional capabilities, and AI-powered analytics.\nFeatures\nSugarCRM's centralized database allows users to access and update contact details, interaction history, and account-specific data, enabling a complete view of customer relationships. The platform offers tools for tracking and nurturing leads through various stages of the sales funnel, with customizable lead scoring.\nA visual pipeline offers representations of the sales process, allowing sales managers to quickly assess the health of their sales funnel and identify bottlenecks. I appreciated the drag-and-drop functionality, which made it easy to update the deal status.\nFor forecasting, SugarCRM uses historical data and current information to help reps fulfill their quotas. I found the AI-powered forecasting tools to be flexible, allowing users to create projections based on various criteria such as product lines, territories, or individual sales reps.\nThe system offers a wide range of pre-built reports and dashboards, covering key metrics across sales, marketing, and customer service. Users also have the ability to create custom reports and visualizations without extensive technical knowledge. I was particularly impressed by the email marketing features, which allow for personalized, targeted communications based on customer data and behavior.\nPricing and plans\nSugarCRM has three main product lines: Sugar Sell for sales teams, Sugar Serve for customer service, and Sugar Market for marketing automation. Sugar Sell, the primary CRM, begins at $49 per user monthly with 12-month billing. The base plan, Sugar Sell Essentials, targets small to medium-sized businesses and includes essential functions like contact management, basic workflow automation, and standard reporting.\nSugar Sell also presents advanced tiers: Sugar Sell Advanced at $85 per user monthly and Sugar Sell Premier at $135 per user monthly. These higher tiers add features like advanced workflow automation, improved support, and AI-powered analytics.\nAlternatives\nIf SugarCRM's complexity is a concern, you might want to consider Zendesk Sell for its user-friendly interface. For businesses looking for a more affordable option with essential features, Less Annoying CRM could be a suitable alternative.\nSupport\nSugarCRM provides a well-rounded approach to customer support, offering various channels for assistance. Support options include email, phone, and community forums. The knowledge base and documentation are extensive. However, response times can vary, and some users report inconsistent support quality.\nMy verdict\nSugarCRM is a strong and flexible CRM solution that provides a wide range of features for sales, marketing, and customer service. Its best quality is how customizable it is, which allows businesses to create an experience that fits their needs. However, some users might find the interface a bit complex, which could be a challenge for smaller organizations with limited technical expertise.\nRead our full SugarCRM review to discover more about this platform.\nBest CRM for startups\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLess Annoying CRM offers a refreshingly simple and affordable solution for small businesses. Its user-friendly interface, transparent pricing, and responsive support make it an excellent choice for those seeking essential CRM functionalities without complexity.\nFeatures\nLess Annoying CRM provides a straightforward approach to customer relationship management, emphasizing essential features without adding unnecessary complexity. The contact management interface is user-friendly, making it easy to add custom fields to meet specific business needs.\nThe platform integrates leads within its pipeline management feature, helping users track leads from initial contact to final sale, offering a visual representation of the sales process. During my testing, I found the pipeline view clear and easy to understand. However, the customization options for the pipeline are limited compared to more advanced CRM solutions.\nLess Annoying CRM also includes basic sales forecasting and reporting tools. Users can create simple reports on pipeline status and sales performance, but it lacks the advanced analytics and predictive features present in some enterprise CRMs. For small businesses and solopreneurs, this level of reporting might suffice, but those needing deeper data analysis may find it lacking.\nI liked how Less Annoying CRM handles task management and calendar integration. It sends daily email digests with upcoming tasks and events, and syncing with Google Calendar and Outlook turns the CRM into a central hub for managing customer interactions and personal schedules.\nPricing and plans\nLess Annoying CRM truly reflects its name with a clear pricing model that stands out in the complicated CRM landscape. The company offers one all-inclusive plan priced at $15 per user per month, billed monthly. This straightforward approach removes the hassle of navigating multiple tiers or understanding feature limitations.\nThe $15 plan grants full access to all features of Less Annoying CRM. This includes unlimited contacts, custom fields, pipelines, and a full suite of tools like contact management, lead tracking, task management, and reporting. There are no hidden fees; the advertised price is exactly what you pay.\nAlternatives\nIf you need more advanced features or integrations, Zendesk Sell might be a better option, though at a higher price point. For businesses looking for a more customizable solution with AI capabilities, SugarCRM could be worth considering, albeit with a steeper learning curve.\nSupport\nLess Annoying CRM is known for its strong customer support. They provide email and phone support during US Central Time business hours. Their help center is comprehensive, with detailed articles and video tutorials. All support is free, even for trial users. However, support is currently only available in English.\nMy verdict\nLess Annoying CRM lives up to its name by providing a simple and user-friendly solution designed for small businesses. Its simplicity is its strongest asset, offering essential features without the complications of larger systems. While it may not include some advanced functions typical of enterprise CRMs, Less Annoying CRM delivers core features in an easy-to-understand way.\nGive our full Less Annoying CRM review a read to learn more.\nBest CRM software for customer support\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nApptivo is a comprehensive platform for business management and collaboration, with a CRM tool included. The Apptivo CRM is famous for its simplicity and scalability, it also gets great reviews for its customer support.\nFeatures\nThe Apprivo CRM has a minimal and uncluttered interface that makes it easy to navigate. It's also very customizable; you can create your unique views, fields, and layouts to simplify your business workflow. Most of the customization occurs with a drag-and-drop workflow, which makes it easy to implement.\nThis CRM has a mobile app that enables you to manage your sales leads on the go. You can do this from anywhere with your smartphone, especially where it\u2019s uncomfortable to use your workstation, e.g., during a commute.\nApptivo has integrations with many other tools to help customers improve their workflow. For example, its integration with Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 makes it easy to send invitations to customers or potential clients outside an organization. Yet, I have observed customer complaints about Apptivo\u2019s integrations being difficult to implement and work with.\nWith this CRM, you can create and manage leads for your business with ease. You can also use the activity tracking tool to manage your routine tasks and ensure you or your colleagues don't fall behind on important tasks. You can get a detailed overview of your notes, emails, calls, scheduled meetings, follow-ups, etc. The contact management tool enables you to track all your contacts in one centralized dashboard and reach out to them when need be, and you can also do the same for your customers.\nPricing and plans\nApptivo offers four plan options, including a 'Lite' plan at $20/user/month, a 'Premium' plan at $30/user/month, a 'Unlimited' plan at $50/user/month, and an 'Enterprise' plan with bespoke pricing.\nEach tier increases limits on features such as the number of apps, custom fields per app, workflows, and custom dashboards.\nAlternatives\nGetting set up on Apptivo can be challenging and take some time. Platforms like HubSpot and Workbooks will make it easy to get set up and going quickly, making them ideal if you need to start benefiting from a CRM as soon as possible.\nSupport\nApptivo offers 24/7 support via email, chat, and phone for all paid plans. The knowledge base and community forums provide additional resources.\nMy verdict\nA major advantage of using Apptivo is that it\u2019s more than just a CRM tool. It has many other useful products for businesses, such as an email marketing tool, an invoicing and billing tool, a procurement management tool, etc. However, these tools aren\u2019t free; you\u2019ll need to pay for them in addition to your CRM bill.\nRead our full Apptivo review.\nBest CRM software for automation\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nInsightly is a great CRM system for managing complex sales pipelines, as you\u2019re able to customize contact data fields, sales funnel stages, and more.\nFeatures\nWorkflow automation, including scheduling emails when sales stages change, can save a lot of time and refocus team efforts on nurturing relationships.\nAnother strong point is its integration capabilities: contact sheets can integrate social media posts, while communications can be drawn from Mailchimp, Microsoft Outlook, and other programs.\nAlso, Insightly\u2019s reporting function can work with Microsoft Power BI to create advanced custom dashboards and reports, helping you measure and plan your sales productivity.\nThat said, lead generation features are slim: while Insightly features a mobile business card scanner, it\u2019s not able to scrape the internet for new leads. I do like the Insightly mobile smartphone apps, which integrate well with features such as mobile voice notes and the aforementioned mobile business card scanner. You don\u2019t get much hand-holding, either: Insightly\u2019s plans include only email and knowledge base support, and phone assistance has an added cost.\nPricing and plans\nThe CRM offering has three tiers, but all of them are paid, and there is no free tier. The 'Plus' plan starts at $29/user/month and comes with all the basic CRM features you would expect. Go up a tier to the 'Professional' plan at $49/user/month and you unlock additional features including workflow automations and custom page layouts. Opt for the top-level 'Enterprise' plan at $99/user/month, and you also get sandboxes and comprehensive audit logging.\nAlternatives\nInsightly doesn\u2019t offer a free plan. This can be an issue for very small and start-up businesses that need a CRM to grow, but don\u2019t have the budget for expensive platforms. Although several platforms offer free options, I suggest considering HubSpot due to its generous free plan.\nSupport\nInsightly provides email support for all users, with phone support available on higher-tier plans. Their knowledge base and community forums offer additional assistance. However, some users report slow response times and limited availability of live support options.\nMy verdict\nIn all, Insightly is a great CRM option for businesses that want to automate key business processes, saving time and money. The platform offers some affordable plans, making it accessible to businesses of all sizes.\nRead our full Insightly CRM review.\nThe best CRM software compared\nCRM software | Score | Lowest monthly fee | Free version | Key features | Support |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd | $25/per user | 30-day free trial | Sophisticated workflow automation; Enterprise app development | Email ticketing and toll-free phone | |\nWorkbooks | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | $43/per user | 30-day free trial | Coaching program, supportive onboarding | Email, phone, knowledge base |\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd | $15/per users | Free plan; 14-day free trial | Combined sales and marketing workflow; Website usage analytics | Live chat, phone, and online meeting support | |\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd | $9/per user | 21-day free trial | Deal management AI; In-built calling tool | Phone and email support, Mon\u2013Fri | |\nApptivo | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd | $20/per user | 30-day free trial | Unique bundled series of apps; customizable and scaleable | 24/7 support via email and live chat; live phone support on weekdays. |\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | $14/per user | Free plan; 15-day free trial | Lead generation through website scraping; Deal management AI | Email support, Mon\u2013Fri | |\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | $249/2-users | 14-day free trial | Unlimited email marketing | Online chat, phone, community | |\nInsightly | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | $29/per user | 14-day free trial | Database and workflow customization; Powerful reporting integrations | Email support only; Premium phone and training support costs $1500/ year |\nZendesk | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd | $19/per user | 14-day free trial | Easy to use; pre built reports | Email, chat, and phone |\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | $12/per user | Free plan; free trial | Visual project management; accessible system | Knowledge base; live chat, email, call | |\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | $15/ per user | 14-day free trial | User friendly; easy-to-use for small businesses | 24/7 email and chat | |\nSugarCRM | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | $19/per user | 7-day free trial | High levels of customization; great tools for manufacturing businesses | Email, phone, and forum |\nLess Annoying CRM | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | $15/per user | 30-day free trial | Simple pricing; super easy to use | Email and phone |\nHow we tested the best CRM software\nWhen we review CRM software, we look at indicators including feature set, interface and ease of use, plans and pricing, and support options.\nA high level of automation capability in managing leads, deals, and workflow is an example feature that could contribute towards a high score. Another important strength would be a desktop and mobile interface allowing quick, intuitive access to basic features.\nWe look at pricing plans and competitors to check whether higher subscription prices are warranted by features you can\u2019t find elsewhere in the market, or whether a good deal could benefit those with lower budgets.\nGenerous customer support options are also prioritized, especially for CRM software which may come with a steep learning curve.\nYou can read our full guide to how we test CRM software at TechRadar here.\nHow to choose the best CRM for you\nWondering how to pick the best CRM for you? Here is what to look out for:\nFeatures\nThe focus of each CRM software solution varies from project management tools to marketing automation to lead generation, so look for the specs that fit your requirements.\nTake time to assess the features list and see how many will work for you and your business. Many CRM platforms offer a free plan or free trial, this can be an excellent way to really get to grips with whether a CRM offers everything you need.\nPrice\nPrice can play a major role in which CRM you choose. Research the plans on offer from the CRMs that meet your needs. Some CRMs offer a free plan, but these can be limited in what they offer. The best open source CRMs are likely to represent a good free option, but the learning curves vary.\nWhen possible, pick a plan that gives you everything you need, but not one where you are paying for features or limits that you won't use.\nAlthough you may not be using it straight away, it can also be worth assessing higher tier plans that are on offer from your CRM of choice. As you grow, knowing there are affordable plans available will save you considerable time and effort migrating to a different platform.\nIntegrations\nCRMs are all about speeding up business processes. Finding a CRM that seamlessly integrates with your other business tools, or offers integrations with tools you would benefit from, can save you considerable time and money.\nBest CRM software FAQs\nWhat is a CRM?\nIn its most basic form, a CRM helps you manage relationships with business prospects, close deals, and make your internal resources more productive.\nYou can use a CRM for cloud storage regarding data about your contacts, including names, job titles, emails, and phone numbers. It also allows you to assign and track workflow tasks to sales teams, such as sending follow-up emails, writing business proposals, and tracking invoices. Finally, a CRM platform can help you analyze and improve the effectiveness of sales and marketing activities through generating custom reports, forecasting future revenue, and anticipating sales bottlenecks.\nHow can CRM software improve customer retention?\nUsing a CRM platform isn\u2019t just about making life easier, it can also help you retain customers and drive greater profits.\nA CRM platform gives you the tools you need to track customer interactions, preferences, and purchase histories. This information is highly valuable to everyone from sales to customer service reps, helping them personalize communications, anticipate future customer needs, and address issues proactively and in a way that suits customers.\nCRMs can also support business processes with features such as automated follow ups, targeted marketing campaigns, and loyalty program management. This helps reduce friction in the buying journey, driving repeat business.\nWhy use a CRM?\nWithout a CRM solution, you\u2019d be doing significant manual work to store, track, and interact with contacts, and the sales pipeline would be more sluggish without automation or reminders.\nMany CRM solutions can integrate with software including Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Slack, Mailchimp, and business intelligence platforms, such as Microsoft Power BI.\nPopulating your CRM database with customer data from elsewhere tends to be seamless: most providers allow imports from spreadsheets or contact apps such as Google Contacts.\nHow does CRM software integrate with the sales pipeline?\nHere's a quick example of how a CRM can intergrate with a sales pipeline:\nSomeone in sales could begin by scanning a prospect\u2019s business card, then create a follow-up task, log a phone call, send an email campaign, see recent social media posts, close a deal, and track the status of the project\u2014all in the same software solution. This is how CRM integrates with the sales pipeline.\nHow much does the best CRM software cost?\nCRM software is usually priced as a monthly or yearly subscription, with plans varying in feature complexity. Usually, the quoted price is per user, unless stated otherwise.\nMany vendors offer unlimited free tiers, while paid plans grow in functionality from Starter to Professional to Enterprise. Sometimes, add-ons come at an extra cost; for example, phone credits, premium support, or access to automated marketing tools.\nThe first paid tier in CRM software, which generally works well for small businesses, tends to be between $8 to $29 a month per user, charged on a yearly basis.\nMid-tier plans fit growing businesses and are priced between $20 to $75 a month. As a benchmark, Zoho CRM packs a competitive set of features in its affordable $23 monthly Professional plan.\nFinally, the Enterprise tiers tend to be on the expensive side, offering customization options and a higher level of support: the range is from $40 to $150 monthly, with HubSpot\u2019s full CRM suite reaching a whopping $4,000 a month.\nWhat can a CRM do?\nContact / lead management\nStoring and using prospect details to nurture relationships are at the core of a CRM system. Integrations with contact apps and social media accounts are a plus, maximizing lead information for sales teams.\nDeal management\nWhen there\u2019s a sales opportunity, the deal management feature helps increase productivity so your team can close the deal. This can include setting milestones, tasks, and deadlines.\nWorkflow automation\nAutomation can get critical tasks done while saving time: for example, email templates can be scheduled to go out to prospects when they reach a certain stage in the sales funnel.\nBulk emails\nSending bulk emails to contacts can advance relationships and save sales teams a lot of time. You can usually store and personalize email templates and customize recipient groups.\nCall and email logs\nKeeping track of customer communications in a centralized CRM platform removes the need to rely on human memory and ensures teams are equipped with the latest information on the relationship.\nLead generation\nA good CRM system helps you gather new leads in a cost-efficient way. This can include inputting business card data via mobile app and scraping the internet for specific customer profiles.\nLead assignment\nIf you\u2019ve got a growing sales team, being able to assign leads to staff members is key to ensuring the best person is on the case, thus increasing the chances of closing deals.\nReporting and analytics\nCustomizing and exporting reports on your sales and marketing activities helps you learn from successful deals and focus your attention on high-likelihood prospects.\nDrag-and-drop sales pipeline\nFor manual changes to your pipeline activities, drag-and-drop Kanban-style boards are a quick and easy way to update the status of different deals.\nThird-party integration\nIntegrating with other business software increases the information you have on contacts and can add new features, such as email campaign management.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nOwain has been building websites and online stores for his own and his client's businesses for over 8 years.

      "text": "Best online cybersecurity course of 2025\nLearn how to secure your IT\nWe list the best online cybersecurity courses, to make it simple and easy to access cybersecurity online courses for free or at reasonable prices.\nWe've listed both free and paid-for courses, proving that it doesn't need to be expensive to become qualified in cybersecurity.\nFor long-term career development, while you will ideally need to take a degree or other accredited course in computer science, in which you can choose networking and security topics to suit your career path, there are other options available that you can try in order to test the waters and see whether the industry really is for you.\nOne of the best ways to do this is by signing up for a free online taster course, which introduce some of the basics. These are a great way of seeing if this is the sort of career you'd like.\nEven still, some of the free providers do also provide paid courses which are often cheaper than undergraduate study, and may allow not just for suitable training but also industry connections to help on your path.\nTherefore if you really are interested in exploring cybersecurity, try some of these featured courses to get an idea of whether you might suit the industry, and vice versa, but do be aware that any free training will generally be quite limited.\nAdditionally, check our featured best free VPN.\nReader offer: Top courses from $14.99 when you first visit Udemy\nUdemy is an online learning platform where you can access over 25,000 courses all taught by professionals. Choose from a vast course catalog with topics ranging from programming to lifestyle.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nThe best online cybersecurity courses of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest online cybersecurity course overall\nReasons to buy\nLike Future Learn, Coursera offers a range of short courses for distance learning, including a number of cybersecurity ones such as \"Cybersecurity Specialization\" which was created by the University of Maryland to bring the underlying concepts of the construction of secure systems directly to your web browser.\nIt consists of five courses in total, each of which can take several weeks to complete. These range from Usable Security to a Cybersecurity Capstone Project, so it\u2019s safe to say that they'll require you to already have some intermediate cybersecurity know-how under your belt.\nThere are additional cybersecurity courses available, though, covering everything from the basics to more advanced specializations.\nThere are also online degrees available in either computing and IT or data science, although none are focused specifically on cybersecurity, you can be assured that cybersecurity will be a significant part of the curriculum.\nOverall, Coursera isn't so well-presented as Future Learn, but there are potentially more accredited options for study through it.\nRead our full Coursera learning platform review.\nBest budget online cybersecurity course\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTypically, courses on Udemy cost money, but we\u2019ve found a few worth checking out that won\u2019t put a dent in your bank account.\nThe \"Cyber Security Course for Beginners - Level 01\" could also be advantageous to take, not only for cybersecurity enthusiasts but for anyone who want to learn more about the subject. This particular course offers free video content, but you will not receive a Certificate of completion, instructor Q&A or direct messages.\nHowever, Udemy's real selling point is that not only does it offer some very in-depth courses, many of these courses are extremely cost-effective.\nPaid courses worth looking for for include \"Cyber Security Crash Course for Beginners: Learn From Scratch\" but there are also others to consider such as \"The Data Science Course 2020: Complete Data Science Bootcamp\" which will help provide an insight into the intricacies of computer science.\nIt's worth underlining just how comprehensive and intensive the paid courses can be, and while they may not carry any traditional educational accreditation they could be excellent options if you wanted to consider working as a freelancer to build up some experience, and in a very cost-effective way, too.\nRead our full Udemy learning platform review.\nBest short online cybersecurity courses\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFuture Learn offers a wide range of short and free online sources, with the opportunity to pay for certificates of participation either at the course level or else access all content for a set fee. The courses themselves are well-presented in short and easy to work sections that make learning simple and interesting.\nThe \"Introduction to Cyber Security\" offers a free taster to the subject, and is accredited by UK Government intelligence organization GCHQ, global accreditation and examination institute APMG International, and The Institute of Information Security Professionals. However, there are also a small number of accredited degrees available in IT and computer science which includes a masters degree in cybersecurity.\nOverall, while Future Learn is more focused on general introductory short courses, there are paid-for and accredited learning opportunities available through the platform.\nRead our full FutureLearn learning platform review.\nBest military-grade online cybersecurity course\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNexGenT was created by two US Air Force veterans with extensive experience teaching and training network engineering and cybersecurity.\nThe cybersecurity track features two courses: Basic Training, which serves as a prerequisite, and Cyber Security Specialization. Experienced candidates, however, can skip Basic Training by taking a series of tests to prove their skills.\nBasic Training prepares you for both Full-Stack Network Associate (FSNA) and Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certificates. No prior experience is necessary, and the course is self-paced, so you can start and finish at any time.\nThe \"Cyber Security Specialization\" training course takes place over 22 weeks, covers everything you need to know to protect businesses from cyberthreats, and includes access to NexGenT\u2019s Career Services, which helps students enter the workforce upon completion.\nThe base tuition for the Cyber Security Specialization Program is costly up front at $10,500, or you can choose zero-fee tuition and pay 10% of your salary only once you have a job with a $40,000 salary. After seven years, all remaining debt is forgiven, even if you haven\u2019t paid a cent. That\u2019s how confident NexGenT is that you\u2019ll find a job and earn a living. (Although, the zero-fee tuition option seems not to be available at the moment)\nThat confidence is backed up with some impressive figures: more than 50,000 enrolled students, 460,000 classes taught, and a number of success stories attesting to the effectiveness of their training.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a solid and structured way to enter the professional world of cybersecurity, this may be the right course for you.\nFor more information, read our full NexGenT review.\nBest accredited online cybersecurity course\n5. Open University\nReasons to buy\nThe UK's Open University (OU) is a leader when it comes to distance learning, having spent decades developing its courses, and it serves an international range of students. The online portal for students is excellent with information clearly laid-out, with different modules having clear timetables to work to.\nEven better is that the courses are tailored toward people of all abilities, and do a fantastic job of easing the inexperienced and unqualified into what can be quite deep and advanced topics, while actively trying to prevent students from feeling overwhelmed.\nThe OU offers a dedicated online degree in cybersecurity, as part of its wide range of flexible Computing and IT honors degree courses, where you can choose to focus in different areas, all of which will show a concern for security issues. The OU also offers a dedicated degree in Data Science.\nFor the full 3 year course, the cost is around $21,500.\nThe big advantage of the OU is that it can deliver an accredited degree in computing internationally, and aims to embrace all learners while allowing them to define their own learning path. Additionally, you can take up to 16 years to qualify for your degree through part-time learning.\nBest free online cybersecurity courses\nBest extensive online cybersecurity course\n1. Cybrary\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAs the name suggests, Cybrary is an online library for cybersecurity, IT and other InfoSec-related study materials. After creating a free account, you get access to almost 500 courses, each ranked by their difficulty and all of them free.\nYou can filter classes by level \u2013 Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced \u2013 or by vendors like Cisco, (ISC)2 and Microsoft. Whether you want to learn the fundamentals of malware or the art of the Jedi mind trick, both of those curriculums are given equal prominence in Cybrary\u2019s extensive course catalog.\nWhat is especially good about Cybrary's courses is that they tend to focus on specific aspects of IT, which means if there are areas you'd prefer to specialize in then you can focus on that rather than have to take a larger course to access it.\nBest government online cybersecurity course\n2. CISA\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCISA (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency) is part of the US Department of Homeland Security, and is an obvious source of cybersecurity expertise.\nHowever, you may not have been aware that you don\u2019t have to travel all the way to the United States to benefit from the vast experience of US government security experts, or that you can do so for free.\nThe DHS has a calendar full of training events you can attend in Idaho Falls, but for everyone who doesn\u2019t live in the midwestern US there\u2019s an entire portal of online courses available to those involved in the security of industrial control systems.\nBest general online cybersecurity course\n3. Open Security Training\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIts website looks like what you'd get if you took all the slideshows and teaching materials from a university cybersecurity department and uploaded them to a domain sporting the most minimalist user interface of all time, but Open Security Training is host to a range of intermediate and advanced classes, along with a swath of beginner lessons that any newbie would be a fool to pass up.\nThere\u2019s a whole rundown on the x86 and x64 architectures wielded by Intel processors, along with introductions to topics along the lines of cellular security, network forensics and vulnerability assessment.\nBest online cybersecurity course for beginners\n4. Heimdal Security\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFrom the same firm that brought you The Daily Security tip comes Heimdal Security\u2019s Cyber Security Course for Beginners. Although this, too, is email-based, its syllabus is significantly more extensive than that of The Daily Security Tip.\nThe Cyber Security Course for Beginners delivers a new lesson every two days for five weeks, and all without the need to pay back any tuition loans. In terms of content, it aims to give you step-by-step advice for keeping your personal data out of nefarious hands.\nBest basic online cybersecurity course\n5. Sans Cyber Aces Online\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIt\u2019s undeniably basic, and yet SANS Cyber Aces provides a nice little introduction to online IT and cyber security that's easy to follow and understand.\nAfter reading through a series of comprehensive entries about operating systems, networking and system administration, you can register for a quiz that puts your expertise to the test. Should highlighted talking points such as installing Linux virtual machine software or basic PHP, Bash and PowerShell web scripting pique your interest, you\u2019ll be in for an engaging lecture.\nWe've also featured the best password manager.\nBest online cybersecurity course FAQs\nWhich online cybersecurity courses is best for you?\nWhen deciding which of the best online cybersecurity courses to use, first consider what level of competency you are currently at. If you've not learned cybersecurity before then it would definitely be recommended to start with the beginner courses, as these will break you into the basics you'll need before you cover more advanced tools. However, if you already have a decent amount of experience with cybersecurity then feel free to try your hand with the more advanced courses.\nHow we tested the best online cybersecurity course\nTo test for the best online cybersecurity courses we searched for a range of popular options as well as took recommendations from people we know who are learning cybersecurity or who are already competent with it. Then we followed the tutorials to get an idea of how easy they were to follow, how easy it was to learn essential tools and processes, and additionally what sort of user level the courses were aimed at, such as beginner, medium, or advanced-level users.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "M&S, Co-Op and Harrods got hit by a cyberattack: here's what retailers need to do to stop this\nBusinesses no longer trade solely in products - they trade in trust\nIn the high-stakes world of modern retail, businesses no longer trade solely in products - they trade in trust. And like a fine crystal vase balanced precariously on a shop shelf, that trust can shatter in an instant. Recently, we saw three retail giants, Harrods, Marks & Spencer, and the Co-op, fall victim to cyberattacks, shaking consumer confidence and underlining a hard truth: cybersecurity is no longer just a matter for technical teams. It is a business imperative.\nThese attacks were not just digital pranks or minor technical hiccups. They were serious, calculated incursions - ransomware incidents attributed to the Scattered Spider group - designed to manipulate human behavior and exploit systemic vulnerabilities. Social engineering was reportedly at the heart of the breaches, where help desk workers were tricked into handing over the keys to the kingdom. It\u2019s the modern equivalent of a burglar sweet-talking their way past a doorman.\nChief IT Security Evangelist at ManageEngine.\nThis is the retail sector\u2019s wake-up call. While e-commerce giants have long championed robust digital defenses, many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers have lagged in their cyber maturity. As digital transformation accelerates - with AI-driven shopping experiences, omnichannel platforms, and data-rich personalization - retailers must recognize that every point of innovation is also a potential point of intrusion.\nSo, what can retail leaders do to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals?\n1. Treat cybersecurity as a strategic advantage, not just a safety net\nRetailers need to move away from reactive firefighting and begin treating cybersecurity as a proactive, strategic function. This means going beyond patching vulnerabilities and installing antivirus software. It means integrating cybersecurity into the very fabric of business operations. Aligning security strategies with business goals to protect revenue, reputation, and customer loyalty.\nUnified security platforms are a powerful way to achieve this. By converging identity governance, AI-powered analytics, and automated remediation tools, retailers can monitor, detect, and respond to threats before they metastasize. Like a well-drilled emergency response team, smart security architecture acts swiftly and decisively when something goes wrong.\n2. Harden the human firewall\nLet\u2019s not forget that even the most advanced systems are still vulnerable to their weakest link: people. The recent attacks at M&S and Co-op illustrate this painfully well. Social engineering remains one of the most effective tools in a hacker\u2019s arsenal, because it bypasses technology entirely by exploiting human behavior.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nRetailers must prioritize cybersecurity awareness across all levels of their workforce. This includes regular training, red-team exercises, and simulated phishing campaigns that help employees recognize threats in real-world scenarios. Password reset processes, especially in IT help desks, must be re-evaluated to include stronger identity verification and limited privilege escalation.\n3. Patch, update, repeat\nIt sounds simple, but too many breaches occur because of outdated systems and unpatched vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals count on organizations putting off software updates or neglecting legacy systems. Regular patch management and vulnerability scanning should be as routine as stocktaking in retail. Systems, applications, and devices must be continuously monitored to close doors before attackers can exploit them.\n4. Segment your network like you would your shop floor\nWhen a ransomware strain finds its way into a network, it spreads like a chain reaction that cracks the system wide open. That\u2019s why network segmentation is critical. By dividing the IT infrastructure into isolated zones - much like separating back-of-house operations from customer areas - retailers can contain breaches, limit lateral movement, and buy precious time for incident response teams.\nMoreover, robust incident response planning is a must. Security audits, breach simulations, and recovery drills should be a regular part of operations. Just as every store manager knows what to do during a fire drill, IT teams must be trained and ready to act at the first sign of a breach.\n5. Rethink IT service management\nRetail IT ecosystems are increasingly complex, spanning in-store POS systems, online portals, handheld devices, and backend logistics software. When something goes down, whether it\u2019s a barcode scanner or an online checkout, the business feels it instantly. A modern, unified IT service desk is no longer a nice-to-have. It\u2019s essential.\nEfficient IT service management (ITSM) tools enable retail organizations to manage their tech assets, resolve incidents swiftly, and coordinate across departments like HR, finance, and logistics. Without such tools, IT teams are left firefighting, unable to see the bigger picture or plan effectively. And in the context of a cyberattack, that lack of visibility and coordination can prove fatal.\nThe new cost of doing business\nRetailers are not just being asked to digitize their operations, they are being asked to secure them. Failing to do so doesn\u2019t just mean downtime or inconvenience; it can mean financial loss, regulatory fines, and a broken bond with customers. M&S, for example, saw its valuation drop by hundreds of millions following its cyber incident. The price of inaction is high - and rising.\nThe truth is that cybercrime is now a cost of doing business. But like insurance or rent, it can be managed. The crystal vase of customer trust may be fragile - but with the right defenses, retailers can keep it safely on the shelf, even in the face of chaos.\nWe've featured the best CRM platform.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best small business software of 2025\nMake work easier to do\nWe list the best small business software, to make it simple and easy to work better and more effectively.\nWhile there are obvious basics, such as productivity suites and accounting software, it's always good to have a general idea of what different types of software are out there, so that the moment you identify a need, you can identify a solution. This is especially the case when you start to grow and find yourself wanting to communicate and collaborate with new employees, customers, or suppliers.\nLuckily, there is a lot of competition online in the business software market, and while there are big name products priced for big name clients, there are always smaller and cheaper packages which can be just as good. The challenge is to find not just the type you need, but the one that comes in at the right price for you.\nHowever, even some of the more seemingly expensive software suites sometimes have a free tier, so you can try it out and see if it works for you - and if it does, you can grow into the software as your business cashflow improves.\nEven better is that sometimes there are free alternatives to paid-for brand name suites, though often it's the case that you get what you pay for, and cheap or free can come with limitations.\nWe'll therefore look to list a wide range of software types that it's good to be familiar with, and feature the best on the market, so that should you develop a need for anything in particular, you already have an idea of what to look for.\nHere are the best small business software solutions currently available.\nYour Business All-in-One. Email, Docs, Storage & AI in a Single Suite. Get Google Workspace Today and save 15% on Starter, Standard and Plus for 12 months (Flex & Commit).\nWe\u2019ve also picked out the best small business web hosting.\nThe best small business software of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest small business software: Best office software\nReasons to buy\nThere are many rivals, but Microsoft still provides the best office software suite, and Microsoft 365 delivers a cloud version you can use on the go as well as at home or in the office. This makes it the workhorse of many businesses of every size, from sole traders to enterprises.\nThe first thing going for Microsoft 365 is its familiarity - if you've used Microsoft Office before you'll easily find your way around this platform. Even if you haven't and have used rivals instead the same still applies because Microsoft Office is the market leader that others attempt to copy.\nThe second is that Microsoft 365 works in the cloud, which offers several advantages, the first being that you can use it on the go with your smartphone or tablet, but the second being that all your documents are saved online in the cloud with OneDrive. This means you don't have to worry about losing important files to a hard drive crash, and also that you can switch between devices without losing your work.\nPricing can seem a little more expensive than it used to be for buying a standalone license for Microsoft 365 Personal, which provides you with Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Publisher, and Access, with online emails served by Outlook, and OneDrive for cloud storage of documents.\nThere's also Microsoft 365 Home which offers up to six licenses which could be ideal and cost-efficient for distributing around employees if you have five or less. Microsoft 365 Business Premium is targeted at larger businesses and includes Sharepoint, Microsoft Exchange, and Microsoft Teams.\nAltogether, Microsoft 365 delivers what you need in terms of an office software and admin platform, and remains superior in terms of functionality than rivals. Additionally, expect to find many suppliers and contractors also using it, making it easy to share, swap, or send send files between your both without any problems.\nRead our full Microsoft 365 review.\nBest small business software: Best for communications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBelieve the hype, or at least part of it \u2013 Slack may not have killed off email just yet, and it can turn into a time sink if you're not disciplined in how it's deployed, but it's also fair to say that this communications platform has helped transform the way that a lot of small business teams keep in touch.\nLike all the best software tools, the basic idea is very simple: real-time messaging in web browsers, mobile apps, and desktop clients. Team members can chat one to one, or in groups, or in channels based around topics (sales, finances, products and so on).\nWhat Slack does well though is bring that simple idea to life very intuitively, with a slick and responsive interface, and a host of integrations, plug-ins and shortcuts to keep the conversation flowing. All the functions you think you might need, from file transfers to video calling, are right there for you.\nYou don't get much out of Slack for free but it gives you a feel for the app, and should be fine for smaller teams. At the highest pricing tier, you get round-the-clock support and a guaranteed support response time of four hours, as well as unlimited message archives.\nRead our full Slack review.\nBest small business software: Best project management software\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGot both a team and multiple projects to manage? Asana helps you work out who should be doing what at any given moment, maximizing the chances of everything coming together on deadline (though you do need a certain amount of talent and hard work from your staff as well, of course).\nAs with the other software tools in this list, it's not just the features that Asana has that make it special \u2013 it's the way those features are wrapped up in an elegant and accessible interface that's easy to navigate around and works across mobile apps and the web without missing a beat.\nWe also like the way Asana integrates very well with more than a hundred other products and services. All the big names are included \u2013 Dropbox, Slack, Gmail, Salesforce and so on \u2013 and this means Asana is flexible enough to fit right into whatever workflow you've got set up at the moment (or want to try in the future).\nWhether you're mapping out the steps in a project, assigning duties and responsibilities, checking on the current status of a plan or trying to get a 'big picture' look at exactly what's happening at any given moment, Asana makes the process much more straightforward than you might expect.\nRead our full Asana review.\nBest small business software: Best sales and marketing app\nReasons to buy\nHubspot is a platform that provides a range of tools for content management, sales and marketing, and social media advertising. Hubspot goes way beyond simply setting up a website and editing its content, as much as delivering a wide-ranging toolkit to help improve conversions, and ranks as our top pick for best content marketing tools as well as features in our best CRM software.\nIt does this by offering options for split testing, content hosting, communications within a sales team and with customers, along with goals and targets that can be tracked using Hubspot's analytics software.\nThere are also a number of additional integrations available, not least Salesforce, Google Workspace, and Microsoft 365.\nAll in all, Hubspot probably isn't the best at any individual feature that it offers, but the comprehensive set that it does offer makes it a clear market leader, and the best at what it does.\nEven better, there's a free tier for trying out Hubspot.\nRead our full HubSpot review.\nBest small business software: Best accounting software\nReasons to buy\nSage Accounting makes a good first impression with its clear and gimmick-free pricing. The top Sage Accounting plan offers decent value and there is also a 30-day free trial.\nFor this, you get modules to manage quotes, invoices, handle and submit tax online, smart bank feeds and reconciliation, cash flow forecasting, some detailed reports, multiple currency support, project tracking and more, all available from your desktop or via a mobile app.\nAll this is well presented and generally easy-to-use. If you run into trouble, detailed web help and video tutorials are only a click or two away, with the offer of \u201cfree unlimited 24/7 telephone and email support\u201d that should help make any newbie comfortable.\nSage also has a more basic offering called Accounting Start. This doesn't include support for quotes, estimates or vendor bills, and has no cash flow forecasts and could be enough for start-ups as well as small businesses.\nRead our full Sage Accounting review.\nBest small business software: Best antivirus\nReasons to buy\nAvast Business is an excellent business antivirus and online security platform, giving you various tools such as antivirus, firewall, email protection, anti-spam and the ability to sandbox applications for complete security. Avast Business also includes a number of tools for your servers, and ranks top of our best business antivirus as well as our best antivirus in 2021 guide.\nThe AV protection you get is generally rated as good by independent testing, with Avast's engine blocking 99.7 per cent of threats in AV-Comparative's Real-World Protection report.\nThe free version of Avast has long been considered one of the best for home users, but If value for money and simplicity are key factors, Avast Business could be a sensible choice.\nRead our full Avast Business Antivirus review.\nBest small business software: Best small business tools\nReasons to buy\nBitrix24 provides a vast suite of powerful business tools: collaboration, instant messaging, telephony, project management, document handling, scheduling, employee management, and more.\nIf you prefer to keep things simple then you can concentrate on the excellent CRM, which is a capable system all on its own. Contacts and communications are logged, leads assigned to sales managers, emails sent, calls recorded, quotes and invoices issued. Detailed reports keep you up-to-date and there's convenient access via the mobile app.\nBitrix24's unusually generous free account supports 12 users and includes 5GB storage, but if you need more, there are additional paid-for accounts which offer more and for more users.\nOverall, Bitrix24 is offers a powerful suite of tools that is especially going to be handy for small businesses and start-ups to help them develop and grow through improved productivity, all in one platform.\nRead our full Bitrix24 review.\nOther small business software to consider\nWe've barely touched the surface of all the different software options a small business might want to consider, not least as there are multiple areas of interest and a strong range of competitors who want to offer the best product for you. However, here are a few more that get honorable mentions, either because they're positioned so well in their respective industries, or they offer a wider ranger of features-and all of them geared toward small businesses:\nPaypal is a long-established merchant gateway provider for taking online payments, and has since moved into physical retail as well as pay and go mobile card readers. All of which means that if you need a payment provider, Paypal can cover you well, no matter what sort of business you have. There's no monthly fee for the basic plan, which will cover online ordering, which helps reduce upfront fees. And once you're well established with a good sales volume and turnover, if you'd prefer to cut down transaction fees then you can switch to a merchant account where for a monthly fee upfront you'll pay mostly interchange rates on each transaction.\nZoho provides so many different software and apps for small business the bigger question might not be what they do, but what they don't. Zoho provides such a comprehensive range of solutions that it's impossible to do the company justice here, suffice to say that they-currently-provide at least 45 apps covering everything from sales, help desk, finance, people, IT, office, project management, and collaboration. What's even better is that not only do these all integrate with each other, but also often integrate with other popular business software platforms. If you need to do something, Zoho probably have already released software to do it!\nAdobe Creative Cloud is probably another toolkit to consider here, not least because of Adobe's real strengths in creativity and design, as well as PDF management-something every business will have to address at some point. Adobe sell different apps in different groups, however, so it's important to ensure you're looking at the correct set. However, don't be surprised if you end up subscribing to multiple apps, not least the creativity bundle that includes Photoshop, and Adobe Acrobat for creating, editing, annotating, and signing PDF files.\nSalesforce is possibly the leading sales solution for businesses of many sizes. Whether you're looking to focus on online or offline marketing, telephone or email sales, then this is an all-in-one platform that aims to bring customer sales and relationships together. However, it's not just about logging numbers and ticketing as much as improving all-round efficiency. This means you can look to improve key metrics across all processes, not least your sales and CRM channels, ensuring both a good synchronicity and efficiency between them.\nGoing mobile? We've featured the best small business apps.\nBest small business software FAQs\nWhich type of small business software is best for you?\nWhen deciding which small business software to download and use, first consider what your actual needs are, as sometimes platforms that aim to do a lot of different things may not offer such an extensive range of tools as one that focuses on one particular area. Additionally, budget software options can sometimes provide all the tools you may need, but higher-end software can really cater for the specialist, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may need to save on the pain of changing to a different software platform later on.\nHow we tested the best small business software\nTo test for the best small business software we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each software platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

Offering coverage across multiple platforms and operating systems, these comprehensive packages often provide the best antivirus, firewall protection, parental controls, a VPN, password manager, and so much more.\nMy team of experts here at TechRadar Pro have spent tens of thousands of hours testing and reviewing hundreds of security products, so we'd like to think we know a thing or two about what makes a good cybersecurity tool.\nIn our reviews, we look at AV-TEST scores for each antivirus package, before going on to examine just how each part of the internet security suite ticks. Whether its VPN server count, inclusion of ransomware protection, or insurance included with identity theft protection.\nBitdefender Total Security remains my top pick for most people, thanks to it's near-perfect scoring across multiple antivirus and security evaluations, attractive price point, and extra features.\nTop 3 internet security suites in 2025\nIn a hurry? Here are our top 3 picks for internet security suites:\n1. Bitdefender Total Security: best overall internet security suite\nOur top recommendation, Bitdefender Total Security offers the best-in-class security for you and your devices.\nFeatures include multi-layered ransomware protection, parental controls, firewall, a Wi-Fi security advisor, a secure browser for online banking, a file shredder, a vulnerability scanner and more.\nPlus with a 30-day free trial, you can give Bitdefender Total Security a go, risk-free.\n2. Norton 360 Deluxe: best internet security suite for families\nNorton 360 Deluxe is a great choice for families as it offers not only parental controls but also a VPN, online backup and dark web monitoring in addition to 50GB of online backup storage.\nNorton 360 Deluxe offers this top-class protection for to 5 devices, and has offerings for both iOS and Android.\n3. Avast One: a great all-round internet security suite\nAvast One offers protection against malicious software, webcam security and data breach monitoring, all wrapped up in one easy-to-use interface.\nNot only that, with Avast One you can protect up to 30 devices with web protection, a VPN, and Avast's Sensitive Data Shield, which adds an extra layer of protection to your private data.\nBest overall internet security suite\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a whole host of features.\n\u2714\ufe0f You use devices across a range of operating systems - Bitdefender can be used on iOS, Android, Mac and Windows.\n\u274c You have an older CPU as its performance may be impacted.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with advanced PC maintenance tools.\nBitdefender Total Security is the well-respected security firm\u2019s top-of-the-range package and tops the lot when it comes to all-singing all-dancing internet security suites.\nTotal Security is a suite that\u2019s positively bristling with features. You get \u2013 deep breath \u2013 standard antivirus tools plus impressively capable multi-layered ransomware protection, a firewall, a Wi-Fi security advisor, a secure browser (Safepay) for online banking, a file shredder, a vulnerability scanner (to check for missing apps and OS updates), password manager, email spam filter, parental controls, webcam and microphone defenses, and more besides including a superb web protection module for blocking malicious URLs.\nAs well as security features, Total Security provides various PC maintenance and optimization tools. These are somewhat useful in themselves, for cleaning out superfluous files and streamlining boot times \u2013 but more importantly, Bitdefender\u2019s flagship package also covers more than just Windows devices.\nIn fact, an app is provided for Mac users (the software is compatible with M1 Macs, and has been improved to run faster virus scans), as well as clients for iOS and Android mobiles. The Android app also has the capability to block more link-based mobile threats.\nAs it\u2019s only a bit more expensive than Bitdefender Internet Security \u2013 the firm\u2019s mid-tier security suite \u2013 I'd say it\u2019s certainly worthwhile upgrading to Total Security if you have multiple devices across various platforms to protect. (You can see what we think of the range in our full Bitdefender review).\nThere is further good news in that Bitdefender has a minimal impact on system performance, going by independent and my own testing (some rivals do a touch better in this department, but it\u2019s not a difference you\u2019ll ever notice in real-world use).\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s a 30-day free trial of this suite, with no payment details needed; you just have to supply an email address. That means you can try out Bitdefender for a full month before committing to buying and see first-hand for yourself exactly what\u2019s on offer here.\nBest internet security suite for families\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with an integrated VPN.\n\u2714\ufe0f You're looking for an internet security suite for the whole family.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite that doesn't use a lot of resources.\n\u274c You have more than 5 devices you want to use the internet security suite on.\nWhen I evaluated all of NortonLifeLock\u2019s security suite options, I picked out Norton 360 Deluxe as the best value all-around choice for anyone who\u2019s looking to protect more than a single device \u2013 which is likely the majority of folks.\nNorton delivers good basic protection \u2013 although some of the independent test lab results have been a little mixed \u2013 alongside a wealth of features, including webcam protection and dark web monitoring (for users in the US, Canada, UK, Australia and a few other countries), an impressively smart firewall, plus a system of parental controls.\nThe parental controls are top-notch, by the way, including in-depth monitoring systems to keep an eye on what your kids are doing online, and even GPS tracking for their mobile devices. Norton\u2019s very strong in this department.\nThere are some truly worthwhile extras included here, too, like a fully integrated Norton VPN that massively adds to the value proposition of this suite (assuming you don\u2019t have a VPN already, of course), and 50GB of cloud backup storage that's another handy bonus.\nAs for negative points, a flaw worth bearing in mind is that I found Norton 360 Deluxe had more of a drag on system performance than most internet security suites in my own testing. That said, it\u2019s rated as about average in this department by independent test lab AV-Comparatives, and odds are you likely won\u2019t even notice any impact on the speed of your system in everyday usage.\nNorton 360 Deluxe covers up to five devices, either Windows or Mac PCs, plus there are mobile apps for Android and iOS. Pricing is highly competitive compared to rivals, particularly given that bundled VPN, so you should definitely consider this Norton package (compare it to the company\u2019s other offerings with our guide to choosing your Norton plan) \u2013 especially for family usage with those very thorough parental controls.\nBest internet security suite for multiple devices\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a top-rated antivirus engine.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want your internet security suite to cover a lot of devices.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with a fast VPN service.\nAvast One is the trusted security outfit\u2019s revamped suite which offers an umbrella of protection across various bases. That means not just antivirus and ransomware defenses, but also a firewall, webcam protection, data breach monitoring, and a software updater to keep apps patched up with no need for user intervention.\nOn top of that, Avast One provides a full VPN (with unlimited data \u2013 although it\u2019s not the fastest I\u2019ve ever seen, by any means), and some device speed-up and maintenance tools.\nThere are also some more unusual features like a Sensitive Data Shield which scans drives for files that may contain sensitive info like passwords and phone numbers and stops other users of a device from accessing these. In short, you get a lot with the paid subscription of Avast One (there\u2019s a free version which is impressive, too, but it drops a number of features, and the VPN function is limited).\nAll this is wrapped up in a smart and easy-to-use interface which has been thoughtfully redesigned for Avast One, and the cherry on top is the strength of the protection delivered. Avast\u2019s antivirus engine is rated as excellent by the independent test labs, and its web protection is among the best around, too. Furthermore, system slowdown is negligible when running this suite.\nOverall, Avast One packs in a lot of features, and while some of these capabilities may not be as robust as the top performers in this roundup, the sheer weight of what you\u2019re getting means this is one of the best all-rounders out there.\nBest internet security suite for beginners\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with great ransomware protection.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a user-friendly interface.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with configuration options for experts.\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about Trend Micro\u2019s flagship security suite \u2013 Trend Micro Maximum Security \u2013 not the least of which is its polished and user-friendly interface, backed up by superb virus protection. Trend Micro is highly ranked by the independent testing labs, and it offers sterling multi-layered anti-ransomware defenses, too.\nThe package also gives you first-class URL filtering for safer web browsing, further bolstering the overall defenses provided here. That said, one slight weak point with Trend Micro\u2019s offering is that there isn\u2019t a huge amount of low-level control \u2013 such as virus scan options \u2013 so more demanding users may find it lacking here.\nMaximum Security provides parental controls, social media privacy features and PC maintenance tools, although the latter isn\u2019t its strongest suit. It also boasts data theft prevention countermeasures, a secure vault for storing sensitive files, and a decent integrated password manager.\nLess tech-savvy types will appreciate the ease-of-use here, which also goes for the capable mobile apps. There\u2019s a 30-day trial as well, so you can thoroughly check all this out for yourself before pulling the trigger on a purchase.\nBest value internet security suite\n5. McAfee Total Protection Multi-Device\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a high-quality spam filter.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want a good value internet security suite.\n\u274c You want a robust malware protection.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with an advanced VPN.\nAs the name suggests, McAfee\u2019s basic security product, Total Protection Individual, only covers one individual device. And if you\u2019re thinking of buying that, and you own more than just a Windows PC, then you\u2019re almost certainly better off purchasing McAfee Total Protection Multi-Device.\nFor not much more money at all you get a sound internet security suite which protects up to five Windows, ChromeOS, or Mac computers, and Android or iOS devices. US customers also benefit from a useful additional extra in the form of identity theft protection.\nMcAfee\u2019s interface is simple and streamlined, which keeps things easy for beginners, although it\u2019ll likely be too sparse for more experienced users. The UI also suffers from some annoying quirks, but nothing too frustrating.\nIndependent test lab reports suggest McAfee Total Protection offers solid enough defenses, if not class-leading. Indeed, evaluations of McAfee\u2019s antivirus engine vary, with some being more scathing than others.\nOverall, McAfee\u2019s suite represents reasonable value and a decent choice in the Multi-Device package, with some nifty extras for boosting web browsing and app performance, plus an integrated (but very basic) free VPN that\u2019s commendably user-friendly.\nBest internet security suite with VPN\n6. Avira Prime\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite that covers up to 25 devices.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a built-in VPN.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with robust cyber security features.\nThis is an interesting one in that Avira\u2019s top-level package is missing some of the core security features you might find in other internet security suites, but it more than makes up for this in other ways which might be tempting depending on your own personal needs and use case.\nSo, while a firewall and parental controls might be missing from Avira Prime \u2013 or a backup facility (save for a contacts backup feature on the iOS app) \u2013 you do get some nifty stuff instead. That includes a decent VPN and some seriously high-quality PC maintenance tools.\nIf you want those speed-up tools, and/or have been considering getting a VPN as well as a new security suite, then Prime could be a perfect fit. In fact, in the latter case, Avira Prime works out as storming value for money, providing a solid engine to keep you safe, and that Avira VPN on top to keep you safer still online. Others, however, may miss the aforementioned core suite features like parental controls, of course.\nBest configurable internet security suite\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite that is highly configurable.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with with cloud analysis that picks up undetected threats.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with robust, powerful security features.\nESET Smart Security Premium packs in a lot of features including parental controls, webcam protection, network monitoring, additional network protection, and an anti-theft feature for Windows devices allowing for location tracking is an interesting bonus. Furthermore, Linux systems are covered here, as well as Windows and Mac computers.\nHowever, while ESET delivers lots of features, their quality can be variable. For example, the system of parental controls is very barebones, but the password manager is well fleshed out. ESET also offers plenty of configuration options, which will please experts, although computing novices may find it tricky to get to grips with in some respects.\nESET\u2019s antivirus protection seems solid, albeit with some mixed evaluations from independent testing labs. It\u2019s also worth noting that the suite\u2019s defenses have recently been bolstered with Live Guard, an extra layer of cloud analysis to detect newly emerged threats.\nSmart Security Premium provides some interesting extras, too, including the aforementioned password manager, and a secure, encrypted file vault to protect any sensitive data on your PC, which some folks will doubtless find very useful additions.\nThat said, unless you really want this additional functionality, it\u2019s not the best value for money internet security suite out there.\nFastest internet security suite\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite that covers up to 25 devices.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a built-in VPN.\n\u274c You want to use the it on iOS.\n\u274c You want top-of-the-range antivirus protection.\nWebroot majors in being incredibly lightweight and fast-performing. Indeed, it has a minuscule memory footprint, and takes up next to no space on your system drive, as the product\u2019s virus definitions are all stored in the cloud.\nYet despite this minimal impact on your machine, Webroot Internet Security Plus comes with plenty of features. There\u2019s online banking protection, an Identity Shield to prevent data theft from the likes of keyloggers, ransomware defenses, an accurate anti-phishing system, a smart firewall, plus a password manager as you get a LastPass subscription bundled.\nDownsides? Well, you might get lightning quick malware scans, but Webroot hasn\u2019t fared very well in recent antivirus testing by the independent labs (or at least one of them, as the other big players don\u2019t evaluate this product). The accuracy of its engine is mixed at best, so that\u2019s a somewhat worrying question mark at the time of writing.\nStill, Internet Security Plus is a well-rounded package, and as we pointed out in our review, Windows users could always run it alongside the free Microsoft Defender to get the benefit of Webroot\u2019s bonus features, while doubling up on protection. The company\u2019s 70-day \u2018no questions asked\u2019 money-back guarantee is also noteworthy, showing Webroot\u2019s confidence in its suite.\nFind the best deals on Webroot products with our Webroot promo codes.\nMarch 2025 Update - I have updated this guide to reflect accurate pricing and capabilities, alongside devices-per-license and compatibility. Bullguard Premium Protection used to appear on this list. However, Bullguard products were removed from the market on July 25, 2022 after the company was acquired by Norton. Kaspersky Total Security Anti-Virus used to appear on this list. Considering the current climate however, we've taken the decision to remove the provider. Although much of the company's core processes are now take place in Switzerland, the fact that its headquarters remain in Moscow and there have been previous allegations around government coercion, it feels prudent to use the provider with caution. And, when there are so many other excellent providers to choose from, it's impossible to whole-heartedly recommend Kaspersky at this time.\nInternet security suites FAQs\nWhat is the best internet security suite for 2025?\nWhile there are excellent internet security suites out there from names such as Norton, Avast and Trend Micro, we think Bitdefender Total Security is the best you can get right now.\nAvailable to use on up to 10 devices (including Windows, Macs, Android and iOS) Total Security combines super string virus protection with numerous extra features that genuinely add value to the package.\nFor example, a single subscription includes ransomware protection, firewall, Wi-Fi security advisor, secure browser. file shredder, vulnerability scanner, password manager, email spam filter, parental controls, webcam, microphone defenses and more!\nIt's also really easy to set up and use, while not even being that expensive.\nWhat should I look for in an internet security suite?\nAll of the products on this list offer effective capabilities, so the difference is in additional capabilities. If there is a particular type of threat that concerns you, such as ransomware or phishing, check to see if there are specific protections included.\nBanking safeguards, firewalls and parental controls are also areas you should consider \u2013 especially if there are multiple users on your computer. And of course, you should consider whether you need protection across multiple devices, such as smartphones.\nThe number of additional features and devices may impact cost though.\nFinally, think about usability and the impact on system performance. Do you want a high level of customization or do you want an easy-to-use interface and do you want a program that is capable of fast scans or one that requires minimal system resources?\nDo I really need an internet security suite?\nIt\u2019s certainly true that a good entry-level antivirus will deliver strong core defenses against malware, so why would you want to think about getting one of the best internet security suites?\nAfter all, don\u2019t all apps from the same vendor use the exact same antivirus engine, giving you the same fundamental protection \u2013 while a suite demands a heftier price tag?\nOf course, you\u2019ll get more features with internet security suites, but one perception is that these maybe aren\u2019t all that critical to protect your device. And in some cases, this is true; they\u2019re just nice extras to have.\nBut in other cases, you might get capabilities like secure file vaults for your sensitive data, or a secure browser with which to engage in the likes of online banking \u2013 all of which provide worthwhile additional safeguards. Then there are elements like a password manger, or bundled VPN, which again really bolster online security beyond core measures, if you don\u2019t already have these things.\nFeatures like a free VPN could add to the value proposition of an internet security suite in a big way \u2013 depending on your existing software and needs \u2013 and while we mentioned paying more for a suite compared to a basic antivirus, sometimes security vendors don\u2019t charge much more. Indeed, when deals and discounts come into play, it can be the case that there\u2019s barely any difference in price \u2013 and don\u2019t forget, internet security suites usually support a fair few more devices (which can be a major consideration if you need coverage for family members as well as yourself).\nWhat's the difference between antivirus and internet security suites?\nWhile antivirus software provides a basic level of protection for your system, full internet security expands on capabilities such as scanning files and software, activity monitoring and vulnerability search with features tailored for Internet use.\nIndeed, many internet security products are marketed as \u2018suites\u2019 because they contain several different programs that can be accessed by a single interface.\nThese might include a firewall, anti-spam controls, ad blockers, webcam protection, keylogger protection, parental controls and credit card safeguards. There might also be additional protection against web-specific types of malware such as spyware and adware.\nHowever running so many different types of program might mean that internet security suites use more of your system resources than conventional AV.\nCan I create my own free internet security suite?\nThere are many advantages to purchasing a premium internet security suite from a trusted vendor, but it is perfectly possible to create your own modular suite by picking the most suitable free products.\nWhile this might mean you save money, it does mean you have to do much of the work yourself. You will have to identify the best components, whether its virus protection, firewall or backup software, and fix any problems yourself.\nThe more components you introduce will increase complexity and system resource use. You will also suffer from the pitfalls of using free services such as frequent adverts urging you to upgrade.\nUsing a premium internet security suite means the vendor integrates several services into a single package that can be managed from a single interface. What\u2019s more, they might cover several different types of device and offer different tiers of protection.\nIf you do want to build out your own suite, then you can pick the best of individual components in the following advice guides:\n- Rescue disk\n- Encryption software\n- Anonymous browsing\n- Firewall\n- Cloud antivirus\n- Endpoint protection\n- Online cyber security courses\nIn our latest round of updates, we overhauled this page's layout and structure by adding a quick menu, boxouts to give you the pros and cons of the internet security suites on offer and clearer headings. We also double-checked the pricing, deals, server locations, and unblocking capabilities to make sure the information on this page was as accurate and up-to-date as possible.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nBenedict has been writing about security issues for over 7 years, first focusing on geopolitics and international relations while at the University of Buckingham.

These incidents, attributed to the Scattered Spider group, exploited human behavior through social engineering, demonstrating that even advanced systems can be compromised by the weakest link: people. Retailers are urged to treat cybersecurity as a strategic advantage, enhance employee training, regularly update systems, segment networks, and rethink IT service management to protect customer trust and business integrity.",
