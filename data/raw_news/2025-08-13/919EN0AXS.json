  "title": "26 of the Best Keyboard Shortcuts Everyone Should Know",
  "description": "If you spend any amount of time working with a computer keyboard, knowing these shortcuts will save you time\u2014and sanity.",
  "content": "Almost as old as the computer keyboard is the keyboard shortcut, which can transform several clicks of the mouse into a simple combination of keys. Using these shortcuts can save a lot of time and typing, but they can also make it easy to access tools and functionality that are otherwise buried deep in sub-menus. And yet a surprising number of people either don\u2019t know they exist, or don\u2019t know how to use them. If you\u2019re laboring over a keyboard and not using shortcuts constantly to spare yourself some effort, here are the keyboard shortcuts you need to know.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts are combinations of one or more keys pressed in unison that invoke a command that would otherwise have to be clicked on from a menu (or by typing into a command-line interface). Some keys on your keyboard, like the Function Keys (marked F1, F2, etc at the top of most keyboards) or the Windows Key will invoke commands all by themselves. Others are combined with the Control Key (on Windows machines, sometimes abbreviated as CTRL) or the Command Key (on MacOS machines, sometimes abbreviated as CMD) in various ways to make the magic happen. Other keys typically involved in keyboard shortcuts include the Shift keys, ALT keys, and Option key in MacOS.\n\nThere are some \u201cuniversal\u201d shortcuts that are pretty much the same between Windows and MacOS (and even Linux) systems, and some that are unique to each. Plus, you can create your own shortcuts by \u201cmapping\u201d commands to key combinations on your own. While there are hundreds of shortcuts in Windows and MacOS (and more specific to applications), I\u2019ll stick to the most useful pre-mapped shortcuts you can use.\n\nSome keyboard shortcuts operate in Windows, MacOS, and even Linux environments. They\u2019re also the absolutely essential keyboard shortcuts you should be using to make your life just a little easier:\n\u2022 None CTRL+Z/CMD+Z: Hitting the Control or Command keys and the \u201cZ\u201d key at the same time invokes Undo, which is possibly the most powerful and useful tool ever invented. Any time you accidentally delete an entire paragraph from a text file or a whole folder from your hard drive, CTRL-Z can usually undo it.\n\u2022 None CTRL/CMD+A: This will Select everything on your screen.\n\u2022 None CTRL/CMD+C: This will Copy whatever you have selected on your screen, storing it in your computer\u2019s Clipboard until you need to duplicate it. In Windows, you can also use CTRL+Insert.\n\u2022 None CTRL/CMD+V: This will Paste whatever\u2019s in your clipboard into a text file or a folder. In Windows, you can also use SHIFT+Insert.\n\u2022 None CTRL/CMD+X: This shortcut will Cut whatever you\u2019ve selected, deleting it and storing a copy in the Clipboard.\n\u2022 None CTRL/CMD+W: This will Close whatever is the main focus on your screen at that moment.\n\u2022 None CTRL/CMD+F: Invokes the Find tool so you can search within a document, web page, or app.\n\u2022 None CTRL/CMD+P: Will bring up your system\u2019s Print dialog to send your file to the printer.\n\u2022 None CTRL/CMD+N: This shortcut will create a New window or document, depending on the context. For example, when you\u2019re in Word in Windows, CTRL+N will create a new Word document. If you\u2019re currently in your browser, it will create a new browser window.\n\u2022 None CTRL/CMD+S: This will Save your current document. In the days before autosave functionality was standard, hitting this shortcut every few minutes was an essential practice. Usually, adding Shift to this (Shift+CTRL/CMD+S) will save a copy under a new file name.\n\u2022 None CTRL/CMD+R: When you\u2019re focused on a browser window, this shortcut will automatically Refresh the current browser page. Adding in the Shift key (Shift+CTRL/CMD+R) will produce a hard refresh, reloading all data from the source instead of relying on data that\u2019s been cached to speed things up.\n\u2022 None CTRL/CMD+O: Will trigger the Open dialog for the current application.\n\u2022 None ALT+TAB: Pressing the ALT key and the TAB key simultaneously will allow you to Switch between open windows. Hold the ALT key and tap the TAB key until the window you want to access is highlighted, then release the ALT key to select it.\n\u2022 None ALT+F4: Pressing the ALT and F4 keys together will quit the current application you\u2019re focused on. This is slightly different from CTRL+W, which closes the current document, though sometimes closing the document also closes the application itself, so there\u2019s some confusing overlap here.\n\u2022 None CTRL+Backspace: This will delete the word to the left of your cursor in a text document or dialog box.\n\u2022 None WIN+Down Arrow: This will minimize your current window.\n\u2022 None WIN+D: This combination will minimize all open windows at once, showing you the Desktop.\n\u2022 None WIN+Left or Right Arrow: This will snap your current window to the left or right of the screen.\n\u2022 None CTRL+ESC: Hitting the Control key and the Escape key together will bring up the Windows Start Menu. This is mainly useful if your keyboard doesn\u2019t have a dedicated Windows key.\n\u2022 None F2: Pressing the F2 function key will usually open the Rename dialog for a file.\n\u2022 None CMD+Q: Like ALT-F4 in Windows, this shortcut combination will close the current application.\n\u2022 None Option+Delete: Like CTRL+Backspace, this deletes the word to the left of your cursor.\n\u2022 None CMD+D: This will duplicate files that you\u2019ve selected, essentially combining the Copy and Paste functions into one shortcut.\n\u2022 None CMD+H: Hide the current app. Option+CMD+H+M will hide all apps, similar to WIN+D in Windows.\n\u2022 None CMD+M: This will minimize your current window.\n\u2022 None CMD+Comma: This will usually bring up the application\u2019s preferences menu.\n\nThere are plenty more than these, but if you can start using these key combinations in your everyday work, you\u2019ll definitely see an improvement in efficiency and a reduction in computer-related rage.",

      "text": "The Leader Key is a popular concept in coding, and it essentially works like a hotkey. In old-school text editor VIM, a leader key is a shortcut starter, a first button to begin a special command. For example, it's similar to how you might enter the \"#\" key on your TV remote before pressing a code, to enter a hidden menu. Now, The Leader Key Mac app brings the same concept to your entire Mac.\nYou press a predefined shortcut, and then a single key afterward to quickly execute a mapped action. In practice, this means you might press the Globe key and the Right Command key, then S to quickly open the Safari browser. It's similar to the default keyboard shortcuts you're probably already used to, but much more customizable and versatile.\nOf course, you can do the same thing using many keyboard launchers, like Raycast, or even Spotlight Search. But Leader Key is fast. Lightning fast. In the span of two key presses, your app is open, boom. And it's not just limited to apps. You can use it to open URLs (works with any apps that expose URLs to third-party apps) and trigger commands or scripts. It essentially makes everything on your Mac just a few keystrokes away.\nThe app is free and open source. It takes a bit of time to set things up in a way you like, but it's worth it.\nHow to create custom keyboard shortcuts using Leader Key\nOnce Leader Key is installed and enabled, you'll find it in the menu bar. Click on its menu bar icon (it looks like a square with a dot in the middle) and choose the Preferences icon. Here, choose a button combination to be your shortcut starter (or leader key) and enable the app at login.\nNext, start by creating some actions. Ideally, you'll be using Leader Key to launch a lot of different apps, so assigning the \"S\" key for both Slack and Safari won't work. This is where Groups can help. First, click on Add Group and assign that group a key. For example, I'll create a group for Browsers and assign it \"B\".\nIn your new group, click Add Action. Then, assign that action a key.\nFor example, I'll use \"F\" to open Firefox. Next, choose Application from the drop-down menu. Then click the Choose button, and from Finder, select the app you want to map and click Open.\nNow, repeat this process to add more actions in the group (like adding all the browsers that you switch between), or to create global actions. You can also use it to directly open Folders as well (a quick way to open project folders that you use often).\nOnce you are done customizing, click the Save to File button to save all your customizations. Now, you'll be able to open your assigned apps or folders by quickly pressing your leader key, then your group key, then your action key in succession. If an action isn't assigned to a group, it's even simpler\u2014 just press your leader key and the action key.\nSupercharge Leader Key with Raycast Deep Links\nAs mentioned above, Leader Key isn't limited to applications. You can assign it to open URLs and commands, linking directly to a part of an app. As long as an app exposes a URL scheme, you can paste it in as an action (make sure to select URL) as the action. This works for many apps, but Raycast makes the process really easy using its Deep Links feature.\nIf you have your Raycast extensions and actions set already, you can copy the deep link for any action with ease.\nFor example, I'm going to create a shortcut to access the Cobalt for Raycast extension for downloading media online.\nOpen Raycast and search for the action or extension you want to assign a shortcut to. Press Command + K to view all actions, and then use the Shift + Command + C keyboard shortcut to copy the Deep Link.\nThen, go to Leader Key Preferences, create a new action, and choose URL action from the dropdown. Paste in the Deep Link URL.\nNow, you can access that particular action inside Raycast with just a single key press."

      "text": "Mac keyboard shortcuts\nBy pressing certain key combinations, you can take actions that normally require a mouse or trackpad. Every app can have its own shortcuts, and shortcuts that work in one app might not work in another.\nUsing keyboard shortcuts\nKeyboard shortcuts use one or more of these modifier keys, which in menus are abbreviated using symbols:\nControl (or Ctrl) \u2303\nOption (or Alt) \u2325\nShift \u21e7\nCommand (or Cmd) \u2318\nTo use a shortcut, press and hold the modifier keys, then press the last key of the shortcut.

      "text": "Good morning, refiners! As you sit down at your desks today, I hope you're willing to ignore the vaguely dystopian vibes all around you to focus on how awesome and retro your computers are.\nNo, but seriously, I'm a little jealous of Mark S. for getting to spend his days typing away on such a magnificent, mechanical beast. The hefty looking slates from Severance maybe aren't enough to make me want to get severed myself, but I do love a good trackball, and his keyboard has one built in.\nIf you've got the same kind of brain sickness that I do, then good news, you can buy the keyboard from Severance right now. It'll take a hefty donation to Kier first, but hey, at least you get to keep your memories.\nLaunching soon via Kickstarter, but already available via the company's own website, Atomic Keyboard is selling a convincing replica of the keyboard from Severance for the low, low price of $899. Pre-order, though, and you'll be able to grab it for a slightly more reasonable $599 (although the price for pre-orders will raise over time). Shipping is estimated for November, but as with all Kickstarter projects, it's worth remembering that there is an element of risk here.\nStill, that might be a risk I'm willing to take for something so beautiful. While it's unclear which type of mechanical switches this keyboard uses, they appear to be hot-swappable, and the keyboard itself actually has a magnetic faceplate system that allows it to swap between three different modes. There's the \"Innie layout,\" which is accurate to the show and excludes keys like Escape and Control, but there's also the \"Outie layout,\" which brings those buttons back. Interestingly, there's also a \"Dasher\" layout, which is a replica of the real-life DG Dasher D2 keyboard that the Severance keyboard is based on. Notably, this layout swaps the trackball for a numpad, but still arranges the keys like the \"Innie layout.\" Its inclusion also arguably justifies the higher price tag, as finding an actual Dasher D2 in working order these days is quite difficult.\nPart of what makes the Severance keyboard look so satisfying and chunky, though, is the body. That might be contributing to the cost here, as Atomic Keyboard says its replica uses a steel top sheet, with a 15.4 pound aluminum enclosure. The trackball is also pretty large, at 50mm.\nStill, let's say you don't need all that, but still want some Severance vibes at your desk. In that case, you can opt for Signature Plastics' SA Macrodata Refinement (R2) keycaps, a more affordable alternative that you can apply to a regular keyboard to make it look more like the ones in the show. Pair it with a trackball like the Kensington Expert Wireless Trackball Mouse, and you'll have a similar experience for much less.\nOr, if you're feeling crafty, you can 3D print a Lumon-style keyboard for yourself.\nNote, though, that if you pre-order Atomic Keyboards' replica and toss in a $10 deposit, you get a special, Severance style desk mat. With that kind of dedication, maybe you'll get rewarded with a waffle party."

      "text": "Here at Lifehacker we're big fans of keyboard shortcuts, whether it's for your operating system, your web browser, or any of your web apps. They help you get more done in a shorter period of time, without having to lift your fingers from the keyboard or shift your gaze from whatever you're looking at (if your muscle memory is fully trained).\nYou can actually find keyboard shortcuts in more places than you might have realized, and that includes desktop and web apps for Windows and macOS. Sure, the desktop clients are easy enough to use without them, but when you need to skip a song or lower the volume, they can be really helpful.\nWe're going to mention some of our favorite ones for Spotify here, but you can see a full list by pressing Ctrl+? (Windows) or Cmd+? (macOS). Most shortcuts are the same across both operating systems, if you use Cmd in place of Ctrl (or vice versa), and they should work fine in both the desktop client and the web app player.\nBasic playback controls\nStart and stop playback: Got a video call coming in? Someone shouting at you from another room? Hit Space to pause audio playback, then tap it again to carry on.\nShuffle and repeat: If you want to mix up the current playlist or hear the same songs over again (or both), Ctrl/Cmd+S toggles the shuffle mode, and Ctrl/Cmd+R toggles repeat.\nSkip forwards and backwards: Navigating playlists is a key part of using Spotify, and Ctrl/Cmd+Right arrow and Ctrl/Cmd+Left arrow will skip forwards and backwards.\nSeek forwards and backwards: If you want to jump around within a track, on Windows it's Shift+Right arrow or Shift+Left arrow. On macOS, hold down the Cmd key as well.\nRaise or lower the volume: If some adjustment to the Spotify audio volume is required, use Ctrl/Cmd+Up arrow or Ctrl/Cmd+Down arrow to raise or lower it as required.\nLike the current track: Sometimes you'll want to like the current track on Spotify without having to search it out\u2014use Shift+Alt+B on Windows or Shift+Option+B on macOS.\nPlaylists and music\nGet to your playlists: You can use the Shift+Alt+1 (Windows) or Shift+Option+1 (macOS) shortcut to see your playlists; replace 1 with 0 to jump to the Your Library screen instead.\nCreate new playlists: The keyboard shortcut for creating a new Spotify playlist is Ctrl/Cmd+N; if you want to create a new playlist folder, hold down the Shift key as well.\nFilter tracks in the current playlist: If you want to pick our tracks in the current playlist, use Ctrl/Cmd+F\u2014a search bar then appears at the top of the playlist for you to fill out.\nSearch for something to listen to: If you want to run a search of the entire Spotify catalog, use Ctrl/Cmd+K to bring up the quick search box, then add your search query.\nSearch inside your library: For running searches that you want to limit to tracks that have been saved to your Spotify library, use Ctrl+Alt+F (Windows) or Cmd+Option+F (macOS).\nSelect everything: There will be a few screens where you want to select all the tracks on screen, whether it's an album or a playlist or something else\u2014Ctrl/Cmd+A is the shortcut.\nLayout and navigation\nOpen the context menu: If you need to access the context menu on a track or album or anything else selected in Spotify, you can use Alt+J on Windows or Option+J on macOS.\nSee the queue: Want to know what's coming up next in the Spotify queue? Use Alt+Shift+Q (Windows) or Option+Shift+Q (macOS) to see the queue on the right.\nJump to the currently playing track: If you've navigated away to the playlist that's playing and want to get back, tap Alt+Shift+J on Windows or Option+Shift+J on macOS.\nSee what's new: If you're in need of something new to listen to, the Shift+Alt+N (Windows) or Shift+Option+N (macOS) will take you straight to Spotify's new music page.\nToggle the sidebars: Use Shift+Alt+L and Shift+Alt+R (Windows), or Shift+Option+L and Shift+Option+R (macOS) to show or hide the left and right sidebars in the Spotify app.\nOpen up Spotify preferences: If you need to customize any aspect of your Spotify experience, tap Ctrl/Cmd+, (comma) to get straight to the main settings screen."
