  "title": "Premier League tactical trends to watch in 2025-26: Flying full-backs, counter-attacks, and the \u2018Lavolpiana\u2019",
  "description": "How the English top flight could look structurally over the next nine months",
  "content": "Tactically, the Premier League is in a real state of flux.\n\nAfter four consecutive title-winning years with a distinct, possession and territory-based style, Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City were reduced to a third-place finish on 71 points in 2024-25 \u2014 their worst since Guardiola\u2019s debut campaign of 2016-17.\n\nMeanwhile Liverpool cruised to the title in their first season post-Jurgen Klopp, with Arne Slot\u2019s side developing a reputation for their flexibility and adaptability. They had 25 wins and only lost twice across the first 34 matches, by which point the trophy was theirs.\n\nNottingham Forest showed European football can be earned with a throwback, defend-first and counter-attack strategy, while for the second season running all three promoted teams were relegated.\n\nSo what might we expect from 2025-26?\n\nLast season, the chasing pack of European clubs seemed to realise, en masse, that they did not need to copy City, Chelsea, and Arsenal by rolling a full-back into midfield. In fact, those clubs had even more success with flying full-backs running beyond a winger.\n\nPer SkillCorner, Milos Kerkez was the only player in the division to make 100+ overlaps and 100+ underlaps, which suited the directness of Bournemouth\u2019s in-possession approach \u2014 and with him joining Liverpool this summer, makes him a younger iteration of Andy Robertson.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a player that, because of his physical condition, arrives so many times to the last third with the ball under control to put good crosses,\u201d said Bournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola of Kerkez last season.\n\nLikewise, the arrival of Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen, a wing-back in their Bundesliga-winning team of 2023-24, means Slot can deploy maximal width and beyond-the-ball full-backs on both sides.\n\nNewcastle United\u2019s full-back pairing of Lewis Hall and Tino Livramento were particularly frequent underlappers; Antonee Robinson put up 10 assists for Fulham last year, completing the most crosses of any player in the division, consistently running beyond from left-back.\n\nAs per SkillCorner, the frequency of full-backs overlapping has decreased in recent seasons, down nearly 14 per cent in 2024-25 compared to the 2018-19 campaign. Meanwhile, underlaps are on the rise \u2014 up by more than a third over the same period.\n\nThis might seem strange considering the prevalence of inverted wingers, who play on the opposite side to their dominant foot, and like to cut inside, which would suit a supporting overlap.\n\nHowever, many coaches want their wingers to start with high and wide positions regardless, and by enticing opposition full-backs out one-v-one, an underlap can often unlock a defence.\n\nPremier League midfield battles are changing. We see that at goal kicks, when teams will often build-up with six players close to their own goal and position four up on halfway, leaving a hole in central midfield because opponents press man-to-man so often.\n\nIn settled possession, 4-4-2 mid-blocks are increasingly common, to man-mark in central midfield. Consequently, short passing routes through the centre of the pitch have a lot more risk than reward (unless a team has a pivot with the press resistance of Rodri or Ryan Gravenberch).\n\nAs per Footovision, an advanced data provider, the proportion of line-breaking passes played centrally during build-up dropped by five percentage points from 2023-24 to 2024-25 in the Premier League.\n\nExpect to see more of the Lavolpiana tactic, named after Argentine coach Ricardo La Volpe. This is where a central midfielder drops deeper, playing between the two centre-backs, and breaks lines with longer-range passes.\n\nHere is Newcastle\u2019s Sandro Tonali playing that role, allowing right-back Kieran Trippier to push forward and create a two-v-one against Ipswich Town\u2019s left-back.\n\nIf any midfielder was made for the role, it is Youri Tielemans at Aston Villa. He ranked ninth in Europe\u2019s top-five leagues last season for through balls (24).\n\nWith Rodri injured for most of last season, Bernardo Silva used the tactic on an as-needed basis against particularly stubborn mid-blocks. Mateo Kovacic has operated similarly for Guardiola, with this being a consistent feature of his sides.\n\nAnd here is Carlos Baleba doing that in the build-up for Brighton & Hove Albion\u2019s opener away at Manchester United.\n\n\u201cWe had a good balance between defence and controlling the game in possession,\u201d Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler said afterwards.\n\nCoaches tend to value this build-up tweak not just for the way it opens passing lanes \u2014 as opponents are reluctant to commit a player too high to press the midfielder \u2014 but also because it provides extra cover as rest defence versus counter-attacks.\n\nThere is an irony that even as clubs focus on and invest ever more deeply in set pieces, the tactics are trending towards yesteryear.\n\nLast term, 60 per cent of all corners were inswingers, up from 41 per cent in 2018-19. Short corners have remained pretty consistent (roughly one in five) while outswingers have really fallen out of fashion.\n\nTeams largely copied the approaches of Arsenal and Aston Villa, two of the earlier Premier League clubs to hire formal set-piece coaches, who tended to pack the six-yard box and drop inswingers onto the opposition goalkeeper. Everton, too, consistently caused teams problems with these delivery types under Sean Dyche.\n\n\u201cIt is special in the Premier League because you can block, push, foul and there is no whistle,\u201d Crystal Palace head coach Oliver Glasner said of corners last season, indirectly offering an explanation of why more teams are prioritising inswingers \u2014 because they are allowed to.\n\n\u201cThis gives you more opportunities in attacking set plays but it causes more trouble when defending set plays\u201d.\n\nLikewise, teams are increasingly launching the ball upfield from kick-off, and long throws have been on a steady rise across the past four years too: there were 279 throws into the penalty area in 2020-21 (and only three goals from throw-ins that season). Last season, it was 501 and 20 goals from throw-ins.\n\nThomas Frank\u2019s Brentford were \u2014 as in previous seasons \u2014 league leaders here, with 103 penalty-box throws and six goals from throw-ins. Frank, now being Tottenham Hotspur head coach, might give the tactic more popularity if his new side continue to use it.\n\nThe potential re-rise of the 3-4-2-1\n\nChelsea in 2016-17 were the last team to win the Premier League playing a variation of a 3-4-3. City morphed into this shape plenty in attacking during 2022-23 (when John Stones would move from centre-back into midfield), but generally there has been a homogeneity of 4-3-3 among the league\u2019s best.\n\nHowever, the 3-4-2-1 is starting to creep its way back in. It is the first-choice shape of Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, and Glasner at Crystal Palace \u2014 the pair having success with it at their respective former clubs Sporting CP and Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nHere is how it looked for United and Palace in settled possession, able to commit a wing-back onto the last line and with dual No 10s that can pin opposition full-backs, while playing close to their No 9.\n\nIt was a similar story with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Vitor Pereira. When he arrived in December 2024, the club were 19th on nine points after 16 matches.\n\nHis predecessor Gary O\u2019Neil had switched between a back three and four, but Pereira went purely with a 3-4-2-1 for the rest of the season and Wolves took 33 points from their remaining 22 games. They survived comfortably, finishing 16th.\n\nIt might be a blueprint for more teams, particularly promoted sides needing a solid defensive foundation. With so many teams defending in a back four, a wing-back system can be a relatively straightforward way of overloading opponents and creating a front five.\n\nIn total, there were 120 instances of the 3-4-2-1 or 3-2-4-1 (different ways of labelling the same thing) in 2024-25, with its frequency trending upwards since 2019-20, where it was only 25 times.\n\nThe Premier League took the German Bundesliga\u2019s crown last season: England\u2019s top tier is, statistically, the most counter-attacking among Europe\u2019s major leagues.\n\nFast break shots have been on a five-year rise, as has the expected goals (xG, or chance quality) from those scenarios.\n\nAfter 54 fast break goals in 2021-22, the past three campaigns have seen 87, 83, and, most recently, 112 goals.\n\nMore teams trying to play expansively, and in the opposition half, are increasing counter-attacking opportunities. Add to this that there is a particularly high frequency of strikers and wingers with the physical and technical capacity to exploit disjointed and underloaded defences.\n\nLiverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal were the top teams at scoring from fast breaks last season \u2014 it is no longer an underdog tactic \u2014 while Brighton, Tottenham, Leicester City, Nottingham Forest and Brentford were a quintet of clubs who conceded at least eight goals from those scenarios.\n\n\u201cEveryone is talking about what we\u2019re doing with the ball, scoring goals, but when you look at our counter-press, how we win the ball back, it\u2019s so hard for opponents,\u201d Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard said in March 2024.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on the other side before. Trying to defend deep and escaping that when you are being pressed is so difficult.\u201d\n\nExpect to see even more aggressive counter-pressing next season, perhaps more tactical fouls, and coaches with a focus on rest defence \u2014 the positioning of players and spacing between them when a team has possession, ready to counter-press should a turnover occur.",

      "text": "Daniel Munoz likes to run and run and run some more.\nHe does so much running in fact, that he has travelled almost the distance from Selhurst Park to the Etihad Stadium this season.\nThe Crystal Palace wing-back has covered 335 kilometres during 2024-25, averaging 10.83km per 90 minutes.\nOnly Fulham\u2019s Antonee Robinson (345km) has covered more ground.\nAdvertisement\nPer 90 minutes, Munoz ranks sixth in the Premier League for distance covered by full-backs and wing-backs.\nAs impressive as those numbers are, it is the intensity of his running that is most important. No other player in his position can eclipse his average of 25 sprints per 90 (776 sprints across the season), which is testament to the Colombian\u2019s commitment and boundless energy.\nEven his team-mates have been struck by his stamina. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he takes or what he eats or what he drinks, but I need some of that because he is just up and down every game and in training,\u201d Adam Wharton told Match of the Day after Palace\u2019s 2-1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion in April.\n\u201cEvery game he has the highest sprint distance in and out of possession, highest distance (covered), he\u2019s just incredible and I don\u2019t know how he does it. Going to Colombia as well, all the travelling they do and they (Munoz and Jefferson Lerma) just never stop running. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen him get cramp today which is surprising but also not surprising because of how much he runs.\u201d\nMunoz signed a new deal with Palace last week which will run until 2028, giving him potentially a further three years in south London after a whirlwind 13 months since he arrived from Belgian side Genk in January 2024.\nGenk received \u00a36.9million from Palace for that transfer, a deal which has come to represent remarkable value \u2014 helped by the fact that Munoz was eager to move and his contract in Belgium was due to expire in 2025.\nThough the Colombian arrived when Roy Hodgson was manager and Dougie Freedman was still Palace\u2019s sporting director, it was the appointment of Oliver Glasner that made for a perfect match.\nGlasner places great value on the distance covered by his players and the high-intensity sprints they deliver, and this season Munoz has frequently driven down the right flank with and without the ball.\nAdvertisement\nThat ability to cover ground up and down the pitch more or less underpins Palace\u2019s system \u2014 two narrow No 10s with overlapping wing-backs \u2014 and it has made Munoz, if not the most important player within that system, then right up there at least.\nDespite being due to turn 29 the day after the season ends, his athleticism shows no signs of decline, but he brings more to Palace than merely sprinting and covering ground \u2014 he has added end product this season with six goals and five assists across all competitions.\n\u201cHis biggest strength he already showed in Belgium, and it was a reason Palace signed him, is he can be very attacking scoring goals and assists,\u201d Glasner said in his press conference before Palace\u2019s goalless draw with Bournemouth on Saturday.\nHis partnership with Ismaila Sarr has also blossomed, with Munoz providing cover for the right-sided No 10 in attack and working with him to create space.\nDriving into space behind defences has become a staple of Munoz\u2019s play \u2014 he has the most runs beyond the defensive line of any full-back in the division this season (90, which is 20 higher than Diogo Dalot and Lucas Digne), the third most runs ahead of the ball (222) and the most runs to attack crosses (110, almost twice as many as Brentford\u2019s Keane Lewis-Potter with 66).\nInevitably, with such a focus on his attacking play, there is a trade-off in his defensive responsibilities. It is something Glasner is aware of. \u201cHe\u2019s always there, always running,\u201d he said before that Bournemouth draw. \u201cHis effort and attitude is amazing. But on the other side he can develop and improve in defending especially with these runs in behind (him).\n\u201cWe conceded two goals in a row where he lost his player and it was clear he just has to follow. This is what he can still improve but he has so much willingness to learn. One of the reasons we play with a back three is because his attacking style is a threat for any opposition. In this system he can show all of his strengths. His availability and his mentality are so important for us.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThat availability is critical. Palace are away at Arsenal tonight, the only team against whom Munoz has yet to play this season, after five league yellow cards earned him a suspension in December and two Carabao Cup bookings saw him suspended for that competition\u2019s quarter-final in the same week.\nHowever, there has been no absence through injury since he joined and he has completed 90 minutes in all but four of his Premier League appearances.\nPerhaps it is surprising that no clubs came in for him. A new deal does not necessarily ward off anyone interested in acquiring him, with Palace having anticipated offers this summer before that commitment, but it will at least increase the price.\nHis age is likely to be the main limiting factor in where his future lies. There would be some sense in trying to capitalise on his increased value by selling should firm offers be received, but no guarantee can be made that a suitable replacement would arrive. It could also have a destabilising effect.\nPalace will likely want to see him running up and down that right flank for years to come. The new contract should ensure that remains the case for at least another year, if not beyond that.\nIn any case, his profile is perfect for at least as long as Glasner is at the club.\n(Top photo: Daniel Munoz by Sebastian Frej/MB Media via Getty Images)"

      "text": "Patience is a virtue. It is also, as Eddie Howe said last March, a \u201crare commodity\u201d in coaching.\nHe was speaking about Lewis Hall, who had only played for 274 minutes in seven months after joining Newcastle United on an initial loan from Chelsea.\n\u201cWe just need to wait to develop players,\u201d added Howe, with Newcastle obliged to buy Hall at the end of the 2023-24 season. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic wand. It\u2019s been a season of growth for him although the external view would not necessarily have seen that. He has many qualities we are looking for\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nThose attributes were fundamental to Newcastle\u2019s win at home to Nottingham Forest yesterday. It might seem unusual to highlight a left-back in a match that ended 4-3, but Hall was involved in all four Newcastle goals, which were scored in an 11-minute flurry. He registered the most touches (93), tackles (six) and crosses (eight, with three successful) \u2014 and created the joint-most chances (three) \u2014 of any Newcastle player.\nHall\u2019s role in possession was two-fold: to provide a supply line for left-winger Anthony Gordon and left-sided central midfielder Joe Willock, and make plenty of beyond-the-ball runs. Forest were tight in their mid-block marking, so underlaps and overlaps could drag defenders to open passing lanes, and make Hall an option later in the attack.\nThe left-back\u2019s first action of the game was a forward pass to Gordon, followed by an underlap. That did not materialise to anything but on Newcastle\u2019s next build-up, things started to click.\nHall made the textbook full-back play \u2014 receive on the back foot, pass forward, run forward. The actions are simple, though he is pressed by Anthony Elanga, one of the fastest players in the league (not just in top speed but for acceleration over the first three steps).\nHall\u2019s pass and run got Gordon on the ball and up to speed before Forest right-back Ola Aina could shut him down. The underlap took Elanga away, making the opening for an angled Gordon pass into centre-forward Alexander Isak.\nTeams tend to defend with zonal-first principles in mid-blocks to prevent these passes. Forest, however, were particularly player-orientated. Notice how tightly central midfielder Nicolas Dominguez has tracked Willock here.\nFrom Elanga (to Hall), Aina (to Gordon) and now centre-back Nikola Milenkovic (to Isak), Forest\u2019s jumps arrive a little late. Isak sets it through as Hall continues his overlap.\nJust as Hall is about to cross, Elanga recovers and tackles him.\nNearly half of Newcastle\u2019s attacking-half touches were down the left in the opening 45 minutes. This type of game suited Hall and Willock, showcasing their technical quality and in-possession tactical awareness. A week prior, Hall had struggled to defend Savinho when Newcastle pressed man-for-man away to Manchester City and conceded three goals in 14 minutes.\nAgainst Forest, right-winger Jacob Murphy played particularly narrow, acting as a second No 10 (attacking midfielder). Isak had a licence to drift and often ended up on the left, with Newcastle overloading that side.\nNewcastle\u2019s equaliser was classic left-back play. Forest scrambled clear after Hall picked out Bruno Guimaraes at the back-post from a wide free kick.\nWhen Willock reworked play to Hall, he crossed first time and low for Lewis Miley. The midfielder controlled and fired across Matz Sels. With Hall aged 20 and Miley 18, it was Newcastle\u2019s first Premier League goal since January 2007 (James Milner assisting David Edgar) where the goalscorer and assister were both under 21.\nHowe said afterwards that vertical attacks from goalkeeper Nick Pope\u2019s quick throws were \u201csomething we worked on\u201d, clearly mindful of maximising the few opportunities when Forest were disorganised. Newcastle\u2019s second goal, illustrated below, showcased that.\nPope throws to Gordon, who exchanges passes with Hall. The left-back underlaps, pulling Elanga away again, and Gordon plays that pass to Isak.\nIt made a four-v-three, with Hall in place to run onto Isak\u2019s backheel.\nHe drove into the penalty area and tried to cross low for Murphy at the back post. It took a kind deflection off Murillo, looping his pass over Sels for Murphy to bundle in (rather awkwardly) on the line.\n\u201cI thought we were outstanding in that first half,\u201d said Howe. \u201cEverything that we weren\u2019t against City in our last game \u2014 dynamic, fluid, played with speed, intensity.\u201d\nHall facilitates that. Per Skillcorner, which extracts contextual metrics from broadcast tracking data, he is one of only three Premier League full-backs to make 50-plus overlaps and 50-plus underlaps this season. Fulham\u2019s Antonee Robinson and Milos Kerkez of Bournemouth, who are also left-backs, are the others.\nHall was the attacking glue for the third (below), receiving Pope\u2019s quick throw and finding Willock before Forest could regain shape.\nHe weights his pass perfectly, as Gordon and Willock make their clockwork movements.\nWillock takes it in his stride, dribbles inside to change the angle, then slips a diagonal pass for Isak\u2019s run in between the Forest centre-backs.\nJust like the previous goal, Newcastle benefit from a Murillo deflection. This time, Isak\u2019s shot loops over Sels and they have a fourth.\nThat was Isak\u2019s second of the game, having just scored a penalty that was awarded for Aina handballing Hall\u2019s cross. It was not a textbook hat-trick of assists (plus a \u2018pre-assist\u2019 for the fourth) for Hall, but his attacking output was what mattered.\nLast season, Hall only made eight league starts in a campaign when Kieran Trippier had 10 assists from right-back. Howe used four different left-backs last term, mainly fielding Dan Burn there (a nominal centre-back at 6ft 7in/201cm), while Newcastle were the most one-sided team in the league for crosses \u2014 over 60 per cent came from the right.\nAdvertisement\nSo consider this 2024-25 version of Newcastle a second iteration of Howe\u2019s back line. Their 2022-23 success was built on the defensively excellent quintet of Pope, Burn, Sven Botman, Fabian Schar and Trippier \u2014 who won 17, drew 11 and only lost three of 31 starts together. That took Newcastle to the Champions League, though there was a reliance on right-side triangles and Trippier\u2019s output.\nNow, with Trippier on the bench and the athletic, technically secure Tino Livramento at right-back, Newcastle have shared the creative burden. Eleven of their 15 first-half crosses came from the left against Forest.\nHall has made 23 league starts this season and has started every league game since the end of September. His cross frequency has nearly doubled from last term (from 2.6 to 4.7 per 90 minutes), with four assists and a bonus of providing an inswinging corner from the right.\nHis partnership with Gordon is blossoming and complimentary. The pair were called up for England in November by interim head coach Lee Carsley, which led to Hall\u2019s senior international debut.\nHe could replace Trippier for England, too. Gareth Southgate used Trippier as a makeshift left-back at Euro 2024 because they lacked a fit, top-level left-footer in that position. Thomas Tuchel succeeding Southgate means Hall would have the luxury of working with a coach he knows \u2014 Tuchel gave Hall his first-team debut at Chelsea in 2022.\nAt the very least, Howe\u2019s patience has been rewarded."

      "text": "\u201cAttack wins you games, defence wins you titles,\u201d is the famous quote from former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson.\nThis season, that mantra might need revising to \u201cAttack wins you games, rest defence wins you titles\u201d, because of Arsenal.\nRest defence is a term referring to the principles, positioning and structuring of defenders while their team are attacking.\nIt originates from German and Dutch phrases which translate literally as \u201cremaining defence\u201d, and is all about how sides prepare, around and away from the ball, to counter-press.\nAs manager Mikel Arteta has evolved Arsenal to dominate games and opposition territory, counter-attacks are increasingly a costly flaw. This is the case for any high-possession team, not an Arsenal-specific problem, but they did confirm Manchester City\u2019s title win last season by conceding a counter-attack goal away to Nottingham Forest in a 1-0 defeat on the penultimate weekend of league matches.\nAdvertisement\nWhile a captain\u2019s programme notes are often forgettably blah page-filler, Martin Odegaard\u2019s ahead of Arsenal vs Brentford on Saturday were tactically insightful:\n\u201cEveryone is talking about what we\u2019re doing with the ball, scoring goals, but when you look at our counter-press, how we win the ball back, it\u2019s so hard for opponents. I\u2019ve been on the other side before. Trying to defend deep and escaping that when you are being pressed is so difficult.\u201d\nThe Athletic\u2019s playstyle data quantifies what Odegaard was referencing \u2014 see Arsenal\u2019s upward trends under Arteta in terms of possession and field tilt, as well as intensity, chance prevention and high line. Collectively, these show how they have become elite (in or close to the top 10 per cent of teams in Europe\u2019s top seven leagues) at keeping the ball upfield and, when they do lose it, in quickly making tackles and catching opponents offside.\nArteta likes flexible attacking, with plenty of rotations, but there is structural consistency.\nWhereas Arsenal built up in a 3-2-5 shape last season, tucking one full-back deep and moving one centrally, in 2023-24 they are attacking more through a 2-3-5.\nHere is how that looked on Saturday, with Ben White on the ball. All 20 outfielders are in the Brentford defensive third and, collectively, Arsenal are no more than 50 yards in width and 20 yards in length \u2014 you could almost fit them all into the penalty area.\nThe distances between individuals are small, so they are able to connect with short passes, and Arsenal have bodies around the ball to counter-press. This compactness and proximity to the man in possession are essential.\nThe advantage of a 2-3-5 means both full-backs are closer to the pivot, Jorginho, rather than in a 3-2-5. It makes counter-pressing easier but also puts those full-backs in position to connect play to the wingers or make under/overlapping runs, essential in games like this where Arsenal\u2019s wingers often face a double team.\nThe risk? Moving one player further forward vacates space in behind and out wide. The counter-press needs to be perfect, otherwise opponents can get out more easily. Having tall, athletic centre-backs to defend one-v-one in Gabriel Magalhaes and more specifically William Saliba provides phenomenal fail-safes. Similarly, despite questions over athleticism, technically and tactically, Jorginho is as good as single pivots come.\n| Metric | Saliba & Gabriel start | Without at least one |\n|---|---|---|\n51 | 15 | |\n38 | 8 | |\n6 | 4 | |\n7 | 3 | |\n2.4 | 2.4 | |\n0.9 | 1.4 | |\n74.5% | 53.3% | |\n2.4 | 1.9 | |\n16.9 | 13.8 | |\n8.4 | 9.9 |\nOn Sky Sports\u2019 recent Monday Night Football show, when Arsenal won 6-0 away to Sheffield United, Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry broke down Arsenal\u2019s approach post-match. \u201cWe all know who is winning that race,\u201d said Henry on Saliba being up against United striker Oliver McBurnie. \u201cYou\u2019re safe. It\u2019s a one-v-one. You can go send another man forward (in attack)\u201d.\nOn Saturday, Saliba was up against Ivan Toney, one of the Premier League\u2019s most difficult target men to defend against, especially as an out-ball. Saliba won that battle, too. On one occasion in the first half, he hit Toney with a shoulder barge as Brentford\u2019s No 9 chased a clearance. Toney ended up down on the ground, to a standing ovation from some home fans, and Saliba collected the loose ball.\nAdvertisement\nIt is how Arsenal sustain attacks and keep pressure on opponents.\nRepeatedly during Saturday\u2019s match, all 20 outfielders were in the Arsenal attacking third, with Gabriel and Saliba squeezed high. This contained Brentford\u2019s strikers deep (as it has done with other recent Arsenal opponents) and reduced time and space to play when they got possession back. Teams are forced into clearing their lines, trying to dribble out, or having to hit a striker and try to make things stick.\nArsenal\u2019s opener capped a possession lasting over two minutes, almost all of it played in Brentford\u2019s half.\nThe move broke down three times, either when Brentford blocked a pass or made a clearance, but Saliba recovered the ball on each occasion.\nThen came the build-up to the goal.\nWhite\u2019s narrowness is an asset against Brentford\u2019s 5-3-2, with space on the outside of their midfield. Jorginho threads a pass into him and he then finds Bukayo Saka.\nWhite becomes spare on the edge of the penalty area because Vitaly Janelt comes across to double-mark Saka with Keane Lewis-Potter.\nWhite\u2019s cross for the box-crashing Declan Rice is pinpoint, and he heads past Mark Flekken to make it 1-0.\nCrosses like this are a risky percentage play, especially against an aerially dominant Brentford side with three centre-backs. Note how Gabriel and Jorginho are close to Toney and Yoane Wissa as White crosses, ready to pounce and shut down options if Brentford clear it then try to break.\nFor a team who have so much settled possession, Arsenal play few one-touch passes. They move the ball slickly, trying to shift the Brentford block to create space, but there always seems to be a controlling touch, which helps minimise turnovers. \u201cThe areas where you give the ball away are critical,\u201d Arteta said after last month\u2019s away win against West Ham.\nGO DEEPER\nHow Arsenal became one of the best out-of-possession teams in Europe\nRarely do they lose it in central spaces between the penalty boxes. When Arsenal play switches or through balls, they are rarely under-hit. Against Brentford, they opted for chipped passes in behind instead of through balls along the ground.\nJorginho epitomised this. Most of his passes were short, into the half-spaces for full-backs/No 8s, but he was often a spare player on the edge of the penalty area and tried to pick the lock of the Brentford defence with dinked passes over their back five.\nThere is a compound fatigue effect of defending against Arsenal when they attack in waves and grind teams down. This is reflected in the amount of late goals Arteta\u2019s side score \u2014 16 beyond the 75th minute this season, which only Liverpool (24) can better. That stat shows the depth of their bench, too.\nThat showed with their winning goal after 86 minutes on Saturday, another header from a White cross \u2014 with Kai Havertz the scorer this time.\nArteta had made substitutions, changing his left side like-for-like on 79 minutes (Reiss Nelson for Leandro Trossard and Oleksandr Zinchenko for Jakub Kiwior), but also tweaked the build-up structure. With 20 minutes of the 90 remaining, he replaced Jorginho with Gabriel Jesus, adding an extra striker.\nThat effectively had Arsenal playing a 3-1-6 in Brentford\u2019s half, as shown here as Odegaard is about to deliver a cross in the build-up to the winner.\nKristoffer Ajer heads that one clear but it goes straight back to Odegaard, who nods it down to White. Saliba (out of frame) is tight to Toney anyway, in case the ball gets to him.\nWhite and Odegaard exchange passes, with the latter releasing the former, threading a pass inside wing-back Lewis-Potter. Saliba and Rice are tight to Toney and fellow forward Neal Maupay near the edge of the penalty box \u2014 Brentford have been broken down but even if they recover the ball from here, they are not getting out.\nWhite picks out Havertz for all three points, capping a display of outstanding creativity from right-back.\nHe has been an essential part of Arsenal\u2019s off-ball structure in recent weeks and encapsulated their flexibility, as he has rolled into midfield at times to form a double pivot.\n8 \u2013 Arsenal are only the fourth side to win each of their first eight Premier League games of a calendar year; the previous three all went on to win the title that year (Man Utd in 2009, Liverpool in 2020, Man City in 2021). Momentum. pic.twitter.com/jgdKDbORAb\n\u2014 OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) March 9, 2024\nArteta praised \u201cthe maturity, the emotional control\u201d that Arsenal showed.\nA fairly gung-ho second-half approach could have opened the game up at both ends. At one stage, just after Maupay came on with 12 minutes of the 90 left, it looked like it might.\nWhen goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale started kicking long, Brentford went straight in behind from the second balls. Maupay almost scored with his first touch of the evening after he raced through from one such situation but he was just offside.\nIt is a credit to Arsenal\u2019s rest defence that they sustained attacks so well, not losing the game before they eventually won it.\nArsenal have only conceded two counter-attack goals this season, the most recent of them in September against Manchester United.\nWe are approaching the point where Arsenal\u2019s challenge fell away 12 months ago, but their rest defence looks almost impenetrable right now. It is the most underrated weapon in this title race."

      "text": "The Athletic has live coverage of Crystal Palace vs Liverpool in the Community Shield\nThe modern football calendar rarely allows us to catch our breath, but at least the start of a new domestic season always sparks fresh excitement among supporters.\nNew teams, new signings and new managers mean that there are plenty of easy narratives to unpack for the upcoming Premier League campaign, but can we zoom out a little further and predict what broader topics could pop up in 2025-26?\nHere, The Athletic thought it best to look back before looking forward, using some interesting data trends from 2024-25 to examine what tactical quirks might emerge in the upcoming season.\nOutfielder goal kicks are skyrocketing\nBuilding from the back, fans should expect to see the trend of defenders taking goal kicks continue into the upcoming season.\nThis is by no means a new phenomenon and is now widely accepted as a valuable way to build through the thirds during goal-kick phases, opening up the pitch for the in-possession team and preventing the opposition from pinning them to one side of the pitch when pressing high.\nAdvertisement\nWith thanks to former head coach Roberto De Zerbi, Brighton & Hove Albion have been a key proponent of this method in recent years and had the highest volume of outfielders taking a goal kick (158) under Fabian Hurzeler last season. The benefit of this method is highlighted below in Brighton\u2019s home clash against West Ham United, with midfielder Carlos Baleba passing to goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen in the middle of the six-yard box as West Ham press player-for-player.\nNotable gaps between their forward and defensive lines help Brighton exploit the space in the heart of the pitch \u2014 Verbruggen drills a low pass to forward Danny Welbeck, who is dropping into the middle third, and he lays it off.\nLiverpool outfielders took the second-highest number of goal kicks last season (140) but they often use it differently.\nThe principle of emptying the midfield is the same, but this time, defender Virgil van Dijk plays it to goalkeeper Alisson, who loops the ball over Newcastle United\u2019s high press to find Mohamed Salah on the halfway line. A glanced header finds Dominik Szoboszlai with most of the middle third to himself as Liverpool bear down on Newcastle\u2019s defensive line.\nThis might be old news to some, given that it is an established tactical sequence, but the numbers underpinning this recent increase in outfielders taking goal kicks are remarkable.\nSince the 2019-20 law change that allowed players to pass to a team-mate who is within their penalty area when taking a goal kick, the trend has risen so much that outfielders took 28 per cent of all goal kicks last season \u2014 over one in four.\nCould we see a further increase in this trend next season? Or, with pressing structures as sophisticated as they have ever been, might we even see a reversal as teams look for innovative ways to bypass their opponent\u2019s press?\nWill Arsenal and Manchester City rise to the rhythm and embrace chaos?\nFew managers have transformed the football landscape more than Pep Guardiola. All that careful build-up play has evolved since Guardiola arrived at Manchester City, but even he acknowledges that a transitional style is becoming more prevalent in the Premier League.\n\u201cToday, modern football is the way Bournemouth, Newcastle, Brighton and Liverpool play,\u201d Guardiola said in an interview with TNT Sports in January.\n\u201cModern football is not positional. You have to rise to the rhythm.\u201d\nAs the graphic below shows, City and Arsenal average the fewest possessions per game \u2014 more possessions typically indicate a more chaotic game as teams lose and regain the ball \u2014 and have the highest shares of those possession sequences ending with a touch in the opposition penalty area.\nSure, their sides work the ball upfield in a controlled manner to pin the opposition back \u2014 but Guardiola and Mikel Arteta are reluctant to open up the game for fear of losing their rhythm as the game descends into a transitional battle.\nAccording to data from Footovision, 64 per cent of City\u2019s first passes went forward after regaining possession in transitional moments \u2014 the lowest share of any team in the Premier League last season.\nStill, City\u2019s issues in conceding counter-attacks did not evade them during this summer\u2019s Club World Cup campaign, so might they be better off fighting fire with fire? With the pace and trickery of Jeremy Doku, Savinho and Rayan Cherki pairing the direct running of Erling Haaland, City could double down on the strengths of their attacking players and open up their attack when transitional moments arise.\nAdvertisement\nThe same can be said for Arsenal. They have signed Viktor Gyokeres, giving them a player who will run the channels, pin back the opposition defensive line, and thrive in chaotic moments. It might not be a tactic for every game, but City and Arsenal have the personnel to shift to a transitional style.\nThe data suggests Bournemouth, Newcastle, Brighton and Liverpool attack efficiently within a frenetic environment (top-right section of the graphic above), just as Guardiola outlined in January. Given the recent comments and transfer activity from City and Arsenal, you would not bet against the pair gravitating closer to that group for the upcoming season.\nWill we see more rugby-style kick-offs?\nPremier League teams have become increasingly focused on carefully keeping possession over the past decade. Last season, just 11 per cent of passes were hit long, the lowest share since data collection began in 2006-07.\nBut at kick-off, the good old-fashioned hoof has enjoyed a renaissance, with many sides briefly shelving their broader philosophy and playing for territory.\nThe graphic below \u2014 showing the end locations of the first pass after kick-offs \u2014 highlights just how often teams are choosing to go long from the restart, with over 40 per cent of passes aimed into the final third. The wide channels are especially popular, as sides look to overload one side and exploit less aerially dominant full-backs.\nBrentford were particularly effective with this approach, scoring five goals within 80 seconds of a restart last season, including a remarkable run of four games in a row against Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham and Wolverhampton Wanderers.\nExpect Brentford to lean into this approach even more next season, after promoting set-piece coach Keith Andrews \u2014 who Thomas Frank credited for their innovative kick-off routines \u2014 to head coach following Frank\u2019s move to Tottenham.\nIt\u2019s not just the preserve of the more direct sides such as Brentford \u2014 Van Dijk\u2019s diagonals were a common feature of champions Liverpool\u2019s kick-off routines. Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain have taken it a step further, adopting a rugby-style kick-to-touch approach at the Club World Cup to push up the pitch and trigger their highly effective high press.\nGiven their success, expect to see more route-one approaches at restarts in the Premier League next season.\nCould long throws be back on the menu?\n\u201cI try to look into every single detail that can improve the team, or make the chances of winning bigger,\u201d new Spurs head coach Frank said last month.\n\u201cSet pieces are one of them, there are a lot of different set pieces that we can try to improve on, long throws are one of them. Long throws are a good weapon, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a weapon we necessarily need to use every game, but I like to have it in the toolbox.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nIn truth, Frank was forced to give his view on the matter after a Destiny Udogie social media post revealed \u2018long throw auditions\u2019 on Spurs\u2019 schedule during pre-season. However, it is hardly surprising that the Danish coach is keen to unlock that phase of the game in his new side, considering its success at Brentford. Last season, they generated more chances than any other Premier League team from attacking throw-ins (103).\nLiverpool appear to be thinking along similar lines, as The Athletic\u2019s recent Japan tour diary outlined how Arne Slot\u2019s side were working on long attacking throws during pre-season. Wataru Endo was the primary launcher, along with Ryan Gravenberch, Milos Kerkez and Conor Bradley.\nSpurs and Liverpool are interesting cases, given how little they elected to throw the ball into the box last season (graphic below).\nOn the note of set pieces, some goalkeepers might need to keep a closer eye on the clock next season, with the International Football Association Board (IFAB) announcing that referees can now award corners if \u2018keepers hold onto the ball for more than eight seconds.\nInterestingly, two teams that cannot afford to concede corners so freely could be Arsenal and Manchester United. Despite their famed exploits from attacking corners, Arteta\u2019s side conceded 6.8 goals per 100 opposition corners (accounting for opportunity), the worst record in the top flight in 2024-25.\nUnited were not far behind with 6.1 goals conceded per 100 opposition corners. Given how cheap such a corner giveaway would be under the new rules, certain goalkeepers will be acutely aware not to dawdle unnecessarily when they claim the ball in the penalty area.\nMight we see more set-piece goals than ever next season?\nAre same-side wingers extinct?\nAs with many historical Premier League trends, where Arsene Wenger innovated, others followed. The rise of inverted wingers \u2014 wide attackers playing on the opposite side to their preferred foot \u2014 is no different. Robert Pires, one of the early inverted trailblazers, told The Athletic this year, \u201cArsene revolutionised things by putting me, a right-footer, on the left.\u201d\nThe trend shows no signs of slowing. Last season, two-thirds of touches by wingers or attacking midfielders came from players operating on the opposite flank to their natural foot.\nThe transfer market has echoed this growing appetite for wide attackers who can cut inside and attack the half-spaces. Both of Manchester United\u2019s new attacking midfield options \u2014 Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha \u2014 look set to play inverted roles. In pre-season, the right-footed Cunha started as a left-sided No 10, while Mbeumo enjoyed considerable success cutting inside for Brentford last season from the left.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, Mohammed Kudus and Noni Madueke \u2014 big-money signings for Tottenham and Arsenal \u2014 also share this same penchant for drifting inside onto their stronger foot, albeit both can play on their natural left side when required.\nIt\u2019s not all bad tidings for the old-school, chalk-on-his-boots winger that whips in deliveries from their natural side. Open-play crosses underwent a mini-revival last season, with same-side crosses particularly popular for Newcastle, Fulham and Bournemouth.\nAs Premier League managers tweak their tactics before the new season and search for new layers of unpredictability, a return to old-school crossing could provide the edge.\n(Illustration: Eamonn Dalton / The Athletic; Ben Roberts \u2013 Danehouse/Getty Images; Shaun Botterill/Getty Images; Yu Chun Christopher Wong/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Nobody plays 4-4-2 anymore. Correction, nobody attacks with a 4-4-2 anymore.\nAlmost 44 per cent of Premier League line-ups in the 2008-09 season were a 4-4-2; it is down to just seven per cent this season. Realistically, teams play multiple formations \u2014 43, if you ask Mikel Arteta about his Arsenal side \u2014 throughout a game, depending on the phase of play. And the top ones are defending in the midfield third, a mid-block, with a 4-4-2.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most malleable formation out of possession,\u201d says Carlon Carpenter, head video analyst at Houston Dynamo of MLS. \u201cIt\u2019s the best use of positioning players (based) on space, it covers most areas of the pitch. The clarity makes it really easy to implement, whether you\u2019re a team that likes to high press, you can press out of a 4-4-2, whether you sit deeper and mid-block.\u201d\nDefending is principle-orientated and opposition-dependent. Most managers/head coaches want a \u201cplus one\u201d at the back, meaning one more defender than the number of opposition forwards \u2014 against a 4-3-3, for example, that\u2019s leaving four on halfway. Man-marking is the norm in midfield, as the best progressors on both teams are usually there, so matching up limits access.\nSingle pivots \u2014 that is, building up with one midfielder deeper and two more playing further forward (picture a point-down triangle) \u2014 are standard. By defending in a 4-4-2, one No 9 can cover that pivot, and his partner can press the centre-backs. The front two often switch roles when opponents play across their back line, in a pressing pattern that looks like a pendulum:\nEverton manager Sean Dyche calls this a \u201csoft press,\u201d to direct opponents into wide areas and then lock them in out there. His main focus: \u201cHow crunched can we make the pitch?\u201d.\nTake this example, from Arsenal\u2019s recent 3-1 win against Liverpool. Arsenal press in a 4-4-2 against a 4-3-3, but left-back Joe Gomez rolls inside to create what Jurgen Klopp calls a \u201cdouble six\u201d alongside Alexis Mac Allister.\nNo 10 Martin Odegaard harries Virgil van Dijk, to force him wide after Ibrahima Konate passed across the defence. Jorginho is onto Gomez. Benjamin White recognises the next pass and is straight out to Luis Diaz, who Van Dijk passes to.\nCarpenter speaks about needing to \u201creally exaggerate the in-to-out defending (pressing wide from a central start point), making sure that you\u2019re really compact. But then, once they actually play that pass wide, because they have nowhere else to go, you press hard. The winger will go hard, a full-back will go hard. That is a one-to-one thing, but the spaces are so limited.\u201d\nThat can be seen here, with Arsenal four-v-three against Liverpool. William Saliba, the right centre-back, has tucked round to cover White. Diaz does not even manage to face up the full-back, and returns the ball to his goalkeeper.\nHere\u2019s an example of the plus-one at the back allowing a centre-back to follow a No 9. Gabriel Magalhaes steps with Diogo Jota, forcing him to bounce Alexis Mac Allister\u2019s midfield-splitting pass straight back where it came from.\nThen, when Liverpool go back out to the left, Arsenal make the same pendulum press, but tweaked slightly with Jorginho stepping to Gomez (rather than Havertz, who can stay on Mac Allister). Odegaard locks in Van Dijk and Liverpool have to play backwards.\nOut of options to play through or round, Liverpool are forced into going over. Goalkeeper Alisson comes all the way into the midfield third and kicks long \u2014 Saliba heads it clear. Over 75 seconds of settled Liverpool possession and no meaningful touches in the final third.\nHere is an example from RB Leipzig\u2019s recent 3-2 loss against Bayer Leverkusen.\nLeipzig have to wait to press, with Leverkusen\u2019s back three and wing-back shape able to escape out wide if a No 9 presses too early. Leipzig sit off for almost 20 seconds.\nFront two Yussuf Poulsen and Lois Openda drop onto Leverkusen\u2019s double pivot \u2014 Dyche calls this \u201cnorth side\u201d screening, and against better teams they might go \u201csouth side\u201d, for added protection. The wingers tuck in to prevent direct access to Leverkusen\u2019s No 10s.\nThen, as middle centre-back Jonathan Tah passes wide, Leipzig come alive. Poulsen darts wide to press Josip Stanisic, backed up by left-winger Xavi Simons.\nLeverkusen are forced back to goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky, then Leipzig press again and force a regain.\nThe increase in mid-block defending is a result of more teams building up short, a trend rooted in former central midfielders becoming managers and head coaches.\nThe average Premier League possession this season lasts 25.2 seconds, more than four seconds longer than in 2018-19 \u2014 Opta define possessions as one or more sequences in a row by the same team, ended by the opposition gaining control of the ball. There are over 28 sequences of 10-plus passes per game (by both teams combined), a 15 per cent rise from five years ago.\nAdvertisement\nMore settled possession means teams have to find solutions to prevent being played through, stop opponents accessing their best players and set traps to press them into errors and wide spaces.\nDefensive principles are part of a club\u2019s game model, which Carpenter describes as \u201ca skeleton you base everything off \u2014 from recruitment to tactical style\u201d. World Cup 2022 winners Argentina, its runners-up France and beaten semi-finalists Morocco were three of the tournament\u2019s top four teams for the share of defending time spent in a mid-block. Argentina and France both defended in a 4-4-2.\nDidier Deschamps gave a reduced defensive role to Kylian Mbappe, with opposite number Lionel Scaloni doing the same for Lionel Messi. They played next to the No 9, with central midfielders stepping out to press the opposition back line.\nHere is an example of Antoine Griezmann doing so for France in the final.\nInternational and domestic football will always contain tactical disparity.\nIn an increasingly physical sport having straightforward principles, which manifest into clear responsibilities, is essential.\n\u201cA major part of it has to be that we (Houston) played 50-something games last year,\u201d says Carpenter. \u201cWe probably had an average of two a week. The actual time that you\u2019re getting to work with players to add these really complex (pressing) tweaks is limited.\u201d\nGO DEEPER\nHow the role of the coach analyst is transforming football\nHouston tried a 4-3-3 press in the 2023 pre-season but switched to a 4-4-2 as it better suited the physical profiles of their forwards and midfielders. They reached the title play-offs while conceding just 27 through balls in their 34 league games, the second-fewest of any side.\nHere is an example of them pendulum pressing, away against Montreal in October, building up with a back three.\nTop sides recruit players with outstanding physical and technical profiles.\nQuick wingers are as effective at pressing a full-back as they are attacking them one-v-one. Tall, athletic centre-backs \u2014 Arsenal\u2019s William Saliba being the prime example \u2014 are immune to the traditional issue of defending wide spaces, and can comfortably track an opposition No 9 if they drop in against a high press.\nAdvertisement\nPep Guardiola spoke last season about needing \u201ca proper defender to win duels one-v-one. In the Champions League, at that level, they (only) need one action to beat you\u201d. His Manchester City side\u2019s mid-block in a 4-4-2 and their compactness was fundamental in them finally winning the Champions League.\nGuardiola demonstrated the flexibility offered by the 4-4-2.\nCity would shift into a 4-2-4, pushing their wingers up to press opposition centre-backs. It underpinned their 7-0 thrashing of Leipzig, who attacked in that round of 16 second leg with a narrow 4-4-2. City pressed with the same structure in the final three months later, against Inter Milan\u2019s 3-5-2.\nHere is an example of out-to-in winger pressing from that latter game, where Bernardo Silva arcs his run to prevent Alessandro Bastoni passing to left wing-back Federico Dimarco \u2014 right-back John Stones steps forward in case Bastoni tries to reach Dimarco anyway.\nWith the left side blocked, Inter play across to the opposite flank. Right centre-back Matteo Darmian is then pressed the same way by left-winger Jack Grealish and has to pass centrally to No 8 Nicolo Barella.\nThis initially looks problematic for City, as teams defend in a 4-4-2 to deny central progression, but when their midfield lock on, Barella is forced wide to Denzel Dumfries. Nathan Ake steps out to the wing-back and locks him in.\nDumfries has no other choice but to try to pick out the front two, but underhits his pass and Rodri makes a regain.\nIn 2012, Arsene Wenger, then the Arsenal manager, said the 4-4-2 was \u201cbest suited to the dimension of the pitch.\u201d He was speaking from an attacking perspective, but it shows the cyclical nature of football that, just over a decade later, the same formation is best suited to defending positional attacking sides.\nDyche, Guardiola, Arteta, Deschamps and Scaloni are rarely seen as tactically united, but all of them are 4-4-2 coaches \u2014 defensively, anyway."

      "text": "Arsenal\u2019s meeting with Manchester City on Sunday was \u2014 unsurprisingly \u2014 not a very open contest.\nBoth managers tried to keep things tight. Mikel Arteta fielded Jorginho and Declan Rice together for the first time. Pep Guardiola moved to a system featuring three central midfielders to ensure City competed in that zone. Bernardo Silva played in front of the champions\u2019 defence and kept his distribution short, with Mateo Kovacic and Rico Lewis just ahead of him.\nGO DEEPER\nArsenal v Man City 2.0 - a world of set pieces, tough tackles and dogged defence\nWith so many players in that area of the pitch and in such a frantic, physical game, no one had any space in midfield.\nExcept, that is, from goal kicks.\nThese days, goal kicks are a peculiar blend of set piece and open play: a situation where teams have planned moves, to play out from defence and to press the opposition high, but also where a huge amount of grass is unoccupied.\nThat\u2019s a qualified statement, however, because the most interesting thing about goal kicks isn\u2019t necessarily the specific build-up pattern or the type of pressing, but the areas of the pitch where there is space.\nOn several occasions during the game, when Ederson or David Raya had possession, the situation was five-versus-five around the edge of the penalty area of the team with the ball, five-versus-five on the halfway line \u2014 and absolutely nobody in a yawning gap between the two.\nThis is a pattern better observed in the ground itself rather than on television \u2014 although the use of a \u2018scrolling\u2019 main camera, as UK broadcaster Sky Sports debuted on Sunday, may improve things \u2014 but here\u2019s an attempt to explain the situation.\nAdvertisement\nHere, inside the first minute, is an old-fashioned goal kick.\nRaya has kicked long and all 20 outfielders are within a 30-yard strip across the centre of the pitch, as you would expect.\nBut later, when Raya kicks long in open play after Arsenal had passed the ball to invite pressure, there\u2019s a different situation entirely. Here, City have five players in attack, ready to shut down short passes\u2026\n\u2026and then, when the ball goes forward, City also have five players in defence ready to challenge for that. On this occasion, these include their left-winger Phil Foden, who has tracked back with Ben White, and who Raya seemingly targeted in the air. On this occasion though, it\u2019s Foden who wins the ball.\nBut the most interesting player in the above shot is Martin Odegaard, positioned all on his own just inside the City half, with oceans of space to himself.\nNathan Ake had half-heartedly closed him down to dissuade Raya from playing the ball towards him, before returning to his place in defence. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult, because Raya has the ability to play short and long,\u201d said Guardiola afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to control these long balls.\u201d\nIt was the same situation when Ederson had possession.\nHere\u2019s one of his typical long balls downfield \u2014 Arsenal have five attackers\u2026\n\u2026and five defenders, and absolutely nothing in between.\nA minute later, Ederson has the ball and plays the most interesting pass of the game.\nBecause Arsenal are forced to close down a potential short pass, as well as guard against his huge kicks downfield, they leave themselves alarmingly open in the middle. Ederson can now bisect their four attackers\u2026\n\u2026and feed the ball to Julian Alvarez, who has not merely 10 yards of space behind him as he collects the ball, but 20 yards of space ahead of him too.\nIt\u2019s unthinkable that any player would be allowed this type of space at any other stage of the game \u2014 \u201cWe wanted to find players in the middle more, especially Julian,\u201d Guardiola conceded after the game. City couldn\u2019t quite turn this into a chance, partly because Arsenal got men behind the ball quickly.\nIt\u2019s these situations where players who find space intelligently can thrive \u2014 not necessarily when the goalkeeper has possession, a point when teams often have set game plans and the man-to-man marking takes a predictable pattern \u2014 but during the \u2018transition\u2019 stage just afterwards, when sides go from being deliberately spread out to determinedly compact.\nAdvertisement\nThis is a moment when intelligent players can find gaps as their opponents reorganise.\nIn matches that are otherwise tight and lacking in room for creative players, these situations are important for ensuring that creative, intelligent players can get on the ball.\nAnd while some of these examples are from open play rather than goal kicks, it\u2019s worth giving football\u2019s lawmakers IFAB some credit for changing the goal-kick law in 2019 to allow teams to play goal kicks to team-mates within their own penalty area \u2014 although it\u2019s also worth asking why there was previously a stipulation that they had to play them outside it, which in hindsight seems entirely needless.\nThat change, as expected, has increased the space opponents have to cover high up the pitch, and because the offside rule doesn\u2019t apply at goal kicks, teams also have to use a deeper defensive line than they\u2019d like. The space is therefore logically in midfield, although the extent of it remains somewhat surprising.\nLots of situations on a football pitch in the contemporary game would feel entirely unfamiliar to a viewer from 10 or 20 years ago.\nBut this area of complete no man\u2019s land in midfield at specific points within a game would seem strange to someone just five years ago.\nThat\u2019s how much \u2014 and how quickly \u2014 a tweak to the goal-kick law has impacted the way football is played.\n(Top photo: Getty Images)"

      "text": "With 62 minutes played at Anfield, Bruno Fernandes lined up to take Manchester United\u2019s second corner in quick succession.\n\u201cBoth teams have the same idea, that inswinging corner right on top of the goalkeeper,\u201d said Sky Sports co-commentator and former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher. \u201cWe see it too often now in the Premier League\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nAn analytical point in the heat of a rivalry \u2014 and he\u2019s right. Inswinging corners have steadily risen in the Premier League, from 41 per cent of all deliveries in 2018-19 to 62 per cent this season. Meanwhile, short corners remained stable, accounting for almost one in every five, while outswingers have declined, from over one-third six seasons ago to less than one-fifth now. Almost half of all Premier League corners in 2024-25 have been targeted into the six-yard box. It\u2019s a pattern.\nDespite the fetishisation of corners and obsession with the emergence of set-piece coaches in recent seasons, Premier League teams have become more predictable and less dangerous at them. All 20 sides have taken more inswingers than outswingers this season, and the number of teams who played outswingers at least once in every three corners has dropped from 10 in 2023-24 to two in 2024-25 (just Fulham and Nottingham Forest).\nGoals from corners rose season-on-season from 2020-21 (132) to 2023-24 (171), but are on track to return to the mid-130s based on the first 20 rounds of this campaign. Similarly, after five years of increased efficiency, with the corners-per-goal rate dropping from 30.3 in 2019-20 to 24 in 2024-25, that is back to 30.5.\nThe upward trend of corner goals from 2019-20 owes something to the shock factor of teams giving more time, investment and personnel to dead-ball situations. There might be some finishing regression too, as the last three full league seasons had a similar league-wide total for corner xG. Last season, 12 goals were scored above \u2018expectation\u2019 and there was an underperformance by a similar number in 2022-23. In 2024-25, there have been 70 goals from a total corner xG of 78.9 so far.\nNotably, first and joint-second in the corner goals list are Arsenal (nine) and Aston Villa (six, with Crystal Palace), who were among the first Premier League teams to appoint a set-piece coach and have stuck with an inswinger-dominant strategy ever since. Filter only by inswinging corner goals and Arsenal and Aston Villa account for seven of the 19 this season. Eight teams have only scored once from these deliveries and a further eight haven\u2019t scored at all.\nAdvertisement\nSuccess at attacking corners owes mostly to the quality of the delivery plus the movement and ability of the runners. Therefore, to play inswingers well from both sides, you need good left-footers as well as right-footers.\nThere is a crop of left-footed players currently aged 21 to 25 who all came through Premier League or EFL academies, clearly benefiting from a greater focus on developing technical expertise: Bukayo Saka (Arsenal); Cole Palmer (Manchester City graduate, now at Chelsea); Lewis Hall (Chelsea graduate, now with Newcastle); Leif Davis (Leeds United graduate, now playing for Ipswich); Phil Foden (Manchester City); Anthony Elanga (Manchester United, now at Nottingham Forest); Dwight McNeil (Burnley graduate, now at Everton). Those seven all rank in the top 25 players for inswinging corners this season.\nGO DEEPER\nWhy left-footers are behind record penalty conversion rate in the Premier League\nDefending corners though, is much more about coaching than just talent: schemes, roles and match-specific adjustments matter, and here set-piece coaches have raised the floor considerably. It\u2019s why most teams, with the exception of the heavily zonal-marking approaches of Nottingham Forest and Manchester City, use a hybrid approach, with a mix of zonal defenders and blockers.\nThe return of tall, aerially-dominant No 9s has helped improve defences. Examples of such strikers, who play important, near-post zonal roles, even more so versus inswingers, include Erling Haaland (Manchester City), Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton), Alexander Isak (Newcastle), Dominic Solanke (Tottenham Hotspur), Danny Welbeck (Brighton), Kai Havertz (Arsenal) and Liam Delap (Ipswich Town). Solanke, Haaland and Havertz rank sixth, fifth and fourth within their teams for clearances.\nBecause most teams defend with hybrid approaches and bring everyone back, it often ends up with an overcrowded mess in the six-yard box, while goalkeepers are left partially or completely unprotected because teams do not want to compromise their zonal part of the scheme. Expect to see more of the \u2018Olimpico\u2019 goals (direct from a corner) that United have conceded twice this season \u2014 Trent Alexander-Arnold nearly scored a couple when Liverpool beat Brentford at Anfield in August.\nGO DEEPER\nThe art of the 'olimpico' - football's (usually) rare phenomenon\nThe dominance of inswingers, compared to Europe\u2019s other major leagues, is unique to England\u2019s top tier. The Bundesliga, La Liga and Serie A all have a near-equal split of inswingers and outswingers, while short corners are consistent across the divisions. The Premier League is also an outlier for straight corners, with 32, more than twice as many as the next most (Bundesliga, 15).\nThere are two fundamental reasons for this trend, and a handful of contributing factors too. Refereeing leniency on blocking, including zonal defensive markers though particularly opposition goalkeepers, is significant. United head coach Ruben Amorim, Brighton\u2019s Fabian Hurzeler and Ange Postecoglou, Tottenham head coach, have all bemoaned a lack of fouls called and protection for their goalkeepers after conceding from corners.\nAdvertisement\nCrystal Palace head coach Oliver Glasner, who spent two years at Eintracht Frankfurt, spoke of extra leniency in England. \u201cThere are adjustments to what you need in the Premier League \u2014 the importance of set plays for example,\u201d he said last month. \u201cThe players tell me it\u2019s a big change in the last two or three years, many clubs have set-play coaches and put a big focus on this.\n\u201cIt is special in the Premier League because you can block, push, foul and there is no whistle. But in Europe, when you see English teams play in the Champions League they can\u2019t do this. They can\u2019t block the keeper or push the defenders because then it\u2019s a foul. This gives you more opportunities in attacking set plays but it causes more trouble when defending set plays\u201d.\nLast summer, the Premier League said stricter rules on blocking were to be introduced this season, though teams were given licence to position players creatively. \u201cBeing in the way of an opponent is not the same as moving into the way of an opponent,\u201d it was announced in an article on the Premier League website in September, adding that there would be a \u201chigh threshold for penalising contact\u201d.\nEverton, under Sean Dyche, and Mikel Arteta\u2019s Arsenal are two sides who have used inswinger-dominant approaches, and plenty of blocking, for the last few seasons. It\u2019s become a case of \u2018if you can\u2019t beat them, join them\u2019 for other teams, and fits into the open-play trend of teams becoming more attacking and goal-focused \u2014 outswingers lead to more (lower quality) chances whereas inswingers generate fewer (higher quality) shots but more goals.\nGO DEEPER\nHow to stop Arsenal scoring from corners: Hybrid marking, better grappling and an active keeper\nAcross the Premier League, minutes to players 186cm/6ft 1in or taller have increased each season since 2019-20. That has contributed at both ends of the pitch \u2014 taller players give teams a variety of attacking threats, and added height is beneficial when defending corners too.\nThere has been a significant shift in approach from many sides, particularly those who changed set-piece coaches over the summer, while the relegation of Luton Town last season (they played the second-most outswingers) has played a marginal role too.\nLiverpool, Brentford, Newcastle and Chelsea have all increased their proportion of inswingers by at least 30 per cent compared to the previous campaign \u2014 of the 17 ever-present teams since 2023-24, only Bournemouth (by nine per cent), West Ham (by five per cent) and Forest (by four per cent) have reduced their proportion of inswingers.\nAdvertisement\nLiverpool were the poster boys for outswingers under Jurgen Klopp, with an impressive attacking corners record when assistant coaches Peter Krawietz and Pep Lijnders oversaw set pieces. Full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson whipped predictable but often-unstoppable deliveries towards the penalty spot for Virgil van Dijk and Joel Matip.\nBut the arrival of Aaron Briggs as set-piece coach among Arne Slot\u2019s backroom team means new ideas and a different approach. The consistency and quality have dropped from Alexander-Arnold and Robertson\u2019s delivery, while Van Dijk looks less accustomed to attacking a ball moving away from him (and closer to goal), and has become worse at escaping blockers. Their attacking corners output has declined massively, with only two goals and one came from the second phase.\nChelsea hired set-piece coach Bernardo Cueva from Brentford ahead of 2024-25, with Keith Andrews taking his role at Brentford. Interestingly, neither Chelsea nor Brentford ranked high for inswingers last season, playing plenty of outswingers (both roughly one in four) and short corners (one in four for Brentford; one in three with Chelsea).\nBrentford\u2019s corners were deliberately varied in their earlier Premier League seasons, as staff felt a reputation for being an effective set-piece team meant referees were harsher when penalising them for blocking.\nNow, combine lenient refereeing with high-quality takers for Cueva at Chelsea (particularly with Palmer from the right) and inswingers make sense as the team\u2019s stock ball, even if they lack height across the pitch. Ultimately, if teams can get away with aggressive blocking and crowding of the goalkeeper and zonal markers, inswinging corners become a lot more lucrative.\nBrighton and Manchester United are other examples of teams who replaced their set-piece coach at the end of 2023-24. There was further change for United in December, when Ruben Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag \u2014 and immediately upped their frequency of inswingers.\nInnovation doesn\u2019t always mean something new, and in this instance that manifests itself slightly ironically. Amid a backdrop of a decade of tactical innovation and the rise of possession/pressing-based open-play styles, and considering clubs are giving unprecedented focus and resources to set pieces, the consensus over optimal attacking corner approaches bears a resemblance to the early 2000s and is rather simplistic: \u2018Stick it on the goalkeeper\u2019.\nAdvertisement\nOne interesting approach to defending Arsenal\u2019s inswingers was shown by Monaco in December and recently by Brighton, by leaving multiple players upfield. This forced Arsenal to bring bodies back, reducing their aerial targets, creating more space in the six-yard box (for the goalkeeper) and making blocking more difficult. Arsenal only had one shot from a combined eight corners in those two games.\nWhere Premier League corners go next depends on how rulings change (or don\u2019t), with the technical floor of the league rising and almost everyone having quality takers on both sides of the pitch. It\u2019s probably time for some defensive innovation, and if the late 2010s were about goalkeepers who could play with their feet, the mid-2020s will be about tall(er) goalkeepers who can command their box and deal with aggression \u2014 the six-yard box inswinger looks set to stay.\n(Top photo: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC via Getty Images)"

      "text": "For just over an hour at Old Trafford on Sunday, Manchester United and Crystal Palace cancelled each other out.\nManagers Ruben Amorim and Oliver Glasner watched two fairly evenly-matched sides neutralise each other all over the pitch. Both teams had opportunities to score, even if neither was particularly on top. Step forward the difference maker.\nAdvertisement\nJean-Philippe Mateta, Palace\u2019s in-form striker, was first to react after Maxence Lacroix headed Eberechi Eze\u2019s free kick onto the crossbar, and prodded his side ahead from close range. United huffed and puffed in their attempts to find an equaliser but rarely threatened to score. Then, with a minute of the 90 left, Mateta\u2019s second goal ensured the visitors\u2019 victory.\nReturning from Manchester with three points was validation for Glasner as he nears his first anniversary as Palace manager.\nThe Austrian has a clear vision for Palace and has worked feverishly since being appointed in late February last year on familiarising the squad with his preferred style of play, refining a system to coax the best from them.\nLike Amorim, he set his team up on Sunday in a 3-4-2-1 formation. But where United\u2019s head coach still appears to be digesting the options at his disposal while his players adjust to his demands following his arrival from Sporting CP of Lisbon in early November, Palace are showing the benefits of time, patience and having personnel suited to their brand of football.\nThat match at Old Trafford was actually the third time Amorim and Glasner have pitted their wits against each other.\n\u201cI know Amorim from Sporting; we played them twice with Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League (in the autumn of 2022),\u201d Glasner said in his pre-match press conference. \u201cHe played 3-4-3 there, and we played it at Frankfurt. In both games, they neutralised us for many minutes.\n\u201cAt home, we played 4-2-3-1 and, for 60 minutes, the game was even (and 0-0). Then we got tired because we had to run so much when they switched the play. Playing in an attacking five with the wing-backs, the No 10s and the striker, we couldn\u2019t follow and they found the space. We lost, 3-0.\n\u201cIn Lisbon, both teams played 3-4-3 in the same structure and both managers expected the same behaviour of players in their positions \u2014 for their team to play very intensely. That\u2019s why the game was quite neutralised (Frankfurt ended up scoring twice after the hour-mark to win 2-1). When you go to such a big club like Manchester United, starting with this (outlook) is not easy. But it went his way with determination, conviction, and now you see how he wants to play.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThey look like (they will) get used to it \u2014 the positions with wing-backs, No 6s, a front three in the build-up and press.\u201d\nYet Palace\u2019s win on Sunday was a reminder of how far United still have to go.\nSo what is it that Glasner\u2019s side are doing so well with this formation, where United are struggling?\nA significant part of Palace\u2019s improvement over time under Glasner stems from the presence of Mateta up front, but his form and influence mirror the development of the team as a whole.\nThe French striker has made a habit of successfully running in behind opposition defences. For every 10 runs he makes overall, seven are either in behind or attacking a cross.\nThis helps stretch defences and invites an incisive pass from either of Palace\u2019s twin No 10s, while also presenting Mateta with opportunities to score. With increased confidence and momentum, he is finding that much easier than before \u2014 he has 24 Premier League goals in 12 months, a record many strikers in the division will envy.\nOf those goals, all but one have come in his 37 appearances under Glasner.\n\u201cGlasner\u2019s system reminds me of the Palace team I played in with (Yannick) Bolasie and Wilf (Wilfried Zaha) on the flanks and me up front,\u201d former Palace striker Glenn Murray tells The Athletic.\n\u201cA lot of Mateta\u2019s form is to do with know-how, belief, time at the level, and time with his team-mates building relationships. When you hit the back of the net, the confidence soars \u2014 for you and in those around you. He\u2019s (Mateta) really calmed down in front of goal. It takes time to get used to the Premier League; once a chance arrives, it can be gone before you know it. It takes understanding and time to get used to the intensity. When the chance comes he\u2019s supremely confident.\n\u201cRegardless of his goals, he\u2019s effective even when he has an off-game, because of his physicality. He\u2019s hard to play against.\u201d\nIt should not be a surprise, though, that things are looking up for Palace. It took time to settle at the start of the Glasner era and there was pressure on the new manager before everything clicked into place. The fact they won six of their final seven games last season, many of them comprehensively, suggested the penny had dropped.\nAdvertisement\nThis season followed a similar pattern. There was a significant turnover of players at Selhurst Park last summer, and four new signings only arrived on transfer deadline day at the start of September. That, combined with seven Palace players reaching the final of three different international tournaments, and so reporting back later for club duty, meant time to work tactically with the squad as a collective before the games started to count was severely restricted.\nGlasner has repeatedly referenced it as a reason for Palace\u2019s slow start. They only secured their first win at the ninth time of asking, a 1-0 defeat of Tottenham Hotspur after their worst ever start to a Premier League season. That might have come across as an excuse, but he has subsequently been validated with one defeat in the past eight games and two in 13.\nPalace are seventh in the form table since Amorim was appointed as Erik ten Hag\u2019s successor at United during the November international break.\nThey are now a team who, despite losing defender Trevoh Chalobah halfway through what was meant to be a season-long loan after his recall by Chelsea, look settled. Eight of their starting XI against United on Sunday were at the club last season. Familiarity has been a key part of Glasner\u2019s system.\n\u201cWhen you see the biggest teams, they\u2019re working together,\u201d he also said before that game at Old Trafford. \u201cLiverpool are top with a different manager (Arne Slot having replaced Jurgen Klopp in the summer), but many of the players have been there for five, six or seven years; working together, playing together, knowing each other, understanding how they want to play, understanding their team-mates.\n\u201cIn my career, I was with one club for four years (Austrian side LASK) and I still think that, when I left, it was the best team I ever managed from the tactical side; 80 per cent of the team stayed together for four years.\n\u201cThen it\u2019s always about improving. You can imagine how difficult it is (to get) 20 players in the squad to have the same thoughts. This is what we\u2019re working on. It\u2019s just not possible within one, two or three months to get all your ideas into the players\u2019 minds. But even now, we can improve in every single part of our game.\u201d\nConsidering they play in similar shapes, Palace and United have many tactical differences.\nTake, for example, the consistency, or otherwise, at the No 9 position.\nMateta has started all but two of Palace\u2019s 24 league games this season, and has scored over a third of their 28 goals in those matches. Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have made 13 and eight starts respectively for United, with the latter among the most-used substitutes (16) in the division.\nConsistency is important. Mateta scored 16 league goals last season, but 14 of them came in the final 16 matches. His form follows the same trend this time: four in the opening 19 top-flight games, now six in his past five.\nFrom the end of December 2023 to the middle of the following February, Hojlund scored in six successive Premier League games and he has a tendency to score braces, albeit more usually in European competition. But the inconsistency with which he starts, and finishes, matches has impacted his form, and also means the service the creators in the United side need to provide keeps changing when Zirkzee comes on.\nGO DEEPER\nManchester United's No 9 struggles are a damning symptom of club's decline\nMateta\u2019s relationship with Eze exemplifies the importance of familiarity.\nThe England international has created 25 chances and made nine assists for him since the start of last season. \u201cIt\u2019s easier sometimes, with Eze dribbling past two or three players and then (he) finds me and I can score with a first touch,\u201d Mateta said in an interview with Sky Sports last season. It is an established partnership built upon their complementary games, neither of which United currently have.\nAdvertisement\nHojlund and Zirkzee have significantly contrasting profiles as strikers. Hojlund is similar to Mateta \u2014 a frequent runner in-behind, and left-footed. Zirkzee\u2019s style belies his size (6ft 4in/193cm), being focused far more on linking play and dropping into pockets facing play than running beyond.\nStatistically, he profiles more like Arsenal\u2019s Kai Havertz and Joao Pedro of Brighton, and he runs in behind as much as he drops off, as shown by Skillcorner data.\nAmorim did not have this two-striker dynamic at Sporting last season, where Viktor Gyokeres (who plays like Mateta and Hojlund) led the line and shouldered most of the attacking burden. Palace have a clearer hierarchy.\nBoth these managers arrived at their clubs part-way through a season \u2014 Glasner in February and Amorim in November. The value of having a pre-season with your players shows and a lack of it accounts for slow starts, something the Palace boss has been at pains to point out.\nAmorim has made 36 changes to his 12 Premier League starting XIs since his debut away at Ipswich Town (from game 12 on the viz below) on November 24. Glasner, across the season so far, has only made 43, though without Palace naming an unchanged XI in recent weeks they have kept the core of the team the same.\nAmorim\u2019s rotation owes in part to dealing with match loading, particularly with a young squad and the second half of their schedule of eight midweek Europa League games. In his post-match press conference following the 2-0 defeat by Wolverhampton Wanderers on Boxing Day, he said United had only trained four times in his first month at the club, but the experimentation with players in different positions and roles shows he is still working out how the core of his team should look.\nFor instance, Amad has played wing-back and behind the striker, Bruno Fernandes is mixing games as a No 6 and a No 10, and academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo featured across the midfield roles before Amorim played him as a false nine on Sunday.\nAdvertisement\nThe impact made at Palace recently by Ismaila Sarr, who arrived from Marseille last summer as a winger having not played as a No 10 before, is an example of the time and patience needed when remodelling individuals for system-specific roles.\nPalace have more consistency and attacking quality from their wing-backs than United, which is essential in a system that uses them. Daniel Munoz on the right is more attack-minded than Tyrick Mitchell on the opposite flank, although combined they have eight goal involvements and provide the team with ample width.\nUnited have struggled without a consistently fit left-footed left wing-back, often being boxed in when the right-footed Diogo Dalot fills in there (They signed two left-footed left-backs during the winter window in Patrick Dorgu and Diego Leon.)\nMorocco international Noussair Mazraoui is Amorim\u2019s primary choice on the other side, and is technically secure but he\u2019s more of a defender than an attacker, which increases the burden on United\u2019s No 10s and No 9. Dalot and Mazraoui have just two assists in their 45 combined league starts this season.\nThen there is the time that conditioning work takes, particularly given the intensity with which Amorim and Glasner want their sides to defend. This season, Palace are physically outperforming United and are one of the league\u2019s top sides for high-intensity running. United\u2019s efforts to bridge the gap have involved hiring a running consultant.\nPalace\u2019s improvement under Glasner has come with his team now accustomed to the 3-4-2-1 system. Reaching that point required patience, understanding and appreciation. Amorim is not likely to be afforded those in abundance at a club of United\u2019s stature, even if trusting the process is the only logical way to succeed.\nYet, even now, Glasner is pushing for more out of Palace.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cAs soon as I think I can\u2019t improve anything I will go to the chairman and say, \u2018I think you have to find a new manager. If I can\u2019t have an influence on the players, on our game, then you need a new one\u2019, because then it gets boring for the club,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut the good thing is I see so many things we can improve and work on, so I don\u2019t have to go to the chairman today.\u201d\nPalace will breathe a sigh of relief at that.\nUnited might draw some inspiration from the impact the Austrian has had in south London.\nGO DEEPER\nThe making of Oliver Glasner: The 'normal one' who defied death and became a champion\n(Top photo: Paul Ellis/AFP via Getty Images)"

  "argos_summary": "The Premier League is experiencing a tactical evolution, with teams moving away from traditional possession-based styles to more flexible and counter-attacking strategies. Liverpool, under new management, has thrived with a dynamic approach, while Manchester City has struggled to maintain its previous dominance. The rise of overlapping and underlapping full-backs, along with innovative set-piece strategies, reflects a shift in how teams build attacks and defend. As the league adapts, expect to see continued experimentation with formations and tactics in the upcoming season.",
