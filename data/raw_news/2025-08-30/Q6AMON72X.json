      "text": "If you\u2019ve ever wondered how Bitcoin actually works\u2014beyond the price charts and celebrity tweets\u2014this one's for you.\nAt The Street Roundtable with host Fefe Demeny, Hive Digital Technologies\u2019 Executive Chairman Frank Holmes joined host Fefe Demeny to explain the nuts and bolts of Bitcoin mining.\nAsk Fefe Demeny questions on Roundtable here.\nSo what is Bitcoin mining?\n\"Bitcoin mining is like a big guessing game on computers,\" Holmes explained. \"People use powerful computers to solve really hard puzzles. And when they get the answer right, they earn some new\u2014they call them Virgin Bitcoins\u2014as a prize.\"\nRelated: What is Crypto? Cryptocurrency explained\nThat\u2019s right. The process is basically computers racing to solve math problems. Whoever wins gets new Bitcoin, and also gets to help verify recent transactions on the blockchain. That\u2019s important, because it keeps the network secure and ensures nobody can cheat the system.\nAsk Fefe Demeny questions on Roundtable here.\n\"There\u2019s no one central Visa place that can lock it down,\" Holmes said. \"If someone tries to shut it down, the other thousands of nodes around the world keep it functioning 24/7. That\u2019s what Bitcoin mining does.\"\nWhy decentralization matters\nUnlike a traditional bank or payment processor, Bitcoin is fully decentralized. That means there\u2019s no one company or country in control. The network runs on over 21,000 independent nodes (think of them like checkpoints) scattered across the globe. If one fails, the rest keep running.\nHolmes compared it to Napster, the peer-to-peer file sharing platform that revolutionized music in the early 2000s. \"Napster demonstrated peer-to-peer file sharing,\" he said. \"Bitcoin is decentralized with over 21,000 nodes around the world. That is really key for the Bitcoin ecosystem to operate independently outside of any big money-centered banks.\"\nAsk Fefe Demeny questions on Roundtable here.\nIt\u2019s also constantly running. \"You wake up\u2014there are no holidays. It just functions beautifully and seamlessly.\"\nBitcoin\u2019s roots and security\nHolmes took it back even further than Bitcoin\u2019s 2009 launch to make a point about the tech behind it.\n\"We have to go back in history to the creation of the blockchain, which really shocks people\u2014it was in 1991, before the internet was released,\" he said. \"It was an open ledger of every transaction. It doesn\u2019t let you know the transaction between you and I, but it knows that we did make a transaction, on this date and this amount.\"\nRelated: What is blockchain? Explained\nThat\u2019s where timestamping comes in\u2014something that ensures no one can \u201cfudge the numbers.\u201d Then there\u2019s the encryption layer, SHA-256, the same algorithm Apple uses for Face ID. It protects the system from hackers and keeps the blockchain honest."

The financial transactions of these projects are paid in crypto assets.\nAI coins gain\nTAO, the AI coin behind the open-source protocol Bittensor powering the decentralized machine learning network, rose 0.8% in an hour to reach $338.98.\nThe NEAR coin, which powers the AI-native NEAR Protocol, rose 0.7% to $2.55.\nICP is another prominent AI coin that empowers the Internet Computer blockchain to be leveraged to build both Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 platforms.

Notably, the total crypto market cap also recently surpassed $4 trillion.\nMelissa Otto, head of Visible Alpha Research at S&P Global, said:\n\u201cThe assumptions and performance of Nvidia really dictates what the market is going to start to price into the AI trade, and that whole AI trade has essentially been driving the market this past year.\u201d"

Explained\nOn Aug. 26, the Miami-based firm said that it would build 1.53 gigawatts of new capacity at four different US locations. Hut 8 stressed that the facilities would not be used primarily for Bitcoin mining but for providing capacity for wider computing purposes.\nMore on Bitcoin mining:\nHut 8's 64% stake in American Bitcoin\nPalmer said the move showed \"a real path to monetization for its burgeoning power pipeline over the next few years.\"\nThe strategy reinforces a trend in the mining industry whereby companies are diversifying into AI and other computationally intensive services.\n\"Ultimately, by decoupling energy infrastructure from mining, Hut 8 will increase its financial flexibility and put itself in a stronger position to execute on growth opportunities at scale while preserving upside exposure to Bitcoin through a 64% stake in American Bitcoin,\" Palmer wrote.\nThat stake is representative of Hut 8's agreement with American Data Center Inc., a company financed by Eric and Donald Trump Jr.\n-\nAs per the agreement, Hut 8 contributed its mining equipment to start a new company called American Bitcoin.\n-\nThe Trumps have touted American Bitcoin as the \"world's largest and most efficient Bitcoin miner.\"\n-\nAmerican Bitcoin is expected to go public soon.\nThe HUT stock was trading at $26.37 at press time, up 1.79% a day.\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Aug 27, 2025, where it first appeared in the MARKETS section.

      "text": "One of the foundational industries in the blockchain and crypto space, crypto mining has firmly established itself as a prominent player in the global technology sector.\nPioneering companies from the crypto mining industry have gone on to become one of the most dependable bets in the markets.\nTo put it simply, crypto mining is the process of using high-end computers to solve complex cryptographic puzzles to validate and add transactions to a blockchain network. It requires a lot of computing power to solve these functions, and the reward in the form of newly minted crypto assets is quite lucrative.\nThat is why we have witnessed an extraordinary emergence of crypto mining firms in several parts of the world, but the U.S. takes the lead in mining operations.\nDespite the doubts surrounding the crypto industry in general, these mining companies have cemented themselves as emergent leaders in the global technology market over the years. Of late, such firms have also invited the attention of several well-established giants and even succeeded in persuading them to open their coffers to support crypto mining operations.\nInstitutions open coffers for crypto mining\nWhether it's the Trump family or Jack Dorsey or Google, nobody has been able to escape the charm of the lucrative industry. But the traditional tech industry embracing the disruptive crypto industry wouldn't seem like an unusual phenomenon if we carefully look at the numbers.\nAfter all, Bitcoin \u2014 the premier cryptocurrency that the crypto mining industry primarily focuses on \u2014 has been hitting new all-time highs over the past few months.\nBitcoin mining profits reached their highest monthly mark in July since the last halving in April 2024, JP Morgan analysts wrote in a recent note. Miners earned as much as an average of $57,400 per EH/s in daily block reward revenue the last month.\nIn this story, we look at three crypto mining stocks that the leading analysts are talking about.\nTeraWulf Inc.\nTeraWulf Inc. (Nasdaq: WULF) is a Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing (HPC) firm that recently came under the spotlight following Google, Alphabet's (Nasdaq: GOOGL) iconic tech brand, acquiring a 14% stake in it.\nGoogle is now the largest shareholder of TeraWulf.\n\u201cFluidstack\u2019s decision to expand so soon after our initial agreement speaks volumes about the quality, readiness, and scalability of our infrastructure,\u201d TeraWulf CTO Nazar Khan said of the latest expansion drive with AI cloud provider Fluidstack.\nOn Aug. 8, TeraWulf revealed that its Bitcoin mining capacity grew 45.5% YoY to 12.8 EH/s during Q2 2025. It mined 485 BTC during Q2 2025, as compared to 699 BTC during Q2 2024."

The earnings lift pushed IREN\u2019s share price up 28% on the day after the announcement. Benchmark analysts raised their target for Hut\u202f8 to $36, citing its new 1.53\u202fGW of power infrastructure aimed at AI and high\u2011performance computing, and other crypto\u2011miners such as HIVE are also expanding capacity to capture AI and HPC demand.",
