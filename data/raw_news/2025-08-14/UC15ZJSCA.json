  "description": "The National Border Patrol Council, America\u2019s largest union of border patrol officers, is endorsing former top Trump DOJ official Aaron Reitz to be the next attorney general of Texas.",
  "content": "FIRST ON FOX: The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC), America\u2019s largest union of border patrol officers, is endorsing former top Trump Department of Justice official Aaron Reitz to be the next attorney general of Texas.This comes as current Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican and Trump ally, has declined to run for re-election, instead choosing to challenge GOP Sen. John Cornyn for the U.S. Senate.Reitz is a former Marine who has also served on the staffs of Paxton and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Fox News Digital broke the news in June that Reitz was resigning his high-ranking position with the Trump DOJ to run for attorney general of Texas, entering what he is calling a \"fight for the soul of Texas.\" TEXAS STATE SENATE PASSES NEW REPUBLICAN DRAWN CONGRESSIONAL MAP AS HOUSE DEMS REMAIN ON THE LAMUntil then, he was serving under U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi as the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Policy. Reitz\u2019s campaign is now gaining new momentum with a key endorsement from the NBPC, a national group that represents nearly 20,000 Border Patrol agents and personnel.In a statement shared with Fox News Digital, NBPC President Paul Perez called Reitz \"a principled fighter with a deep sense of duty and an unwavering commitment to supporting the mission of Border Patrol agents.\"Perez said that Reitz \"has had our backs time and again\" throughout his career and that the NBPC is \"confident Aaron will be a fierce and effective ally to defend every inch\" of Texas\u2019 over 1,200-mile-long southern border.\"As Border Patrol agents, we take pride in standing on the front lines of America\u2019s security. As a Marine, Aaron understands that commitment,\" said Perez.THREE STATES SIGN NEW AGREEMENTS WITH ICE FOR EXPANDED IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONSPerez pointed to Reitz\u2019s role as deputy attorney general for legal strategy under Paxton, saying he \"led the legal fight against the Biden administration\u2019s disastrous border policies\u2014quarterbacking dozens of lawsuits challenging the deportation freeze, changes to the public-charge rule, ICE arrest restrictions, the rollback of Remain-in-Mexico, the termination of Title 42, halting border wall construction, the Central American Minors program, asylum, and parole authority.\"He said that later, as Cruz\u2019s chief of staff, Reitz \"drove key legislative initiatives to secure the border\u2014from resuming border wall construction and criminalizing visa overstays, to defunding NGOs aiding illegal entry and reinforcing ICE and the Border Patrol.\"He also said that Reitz was \"instrumental\" in advancing the Justice for Jocelyn Act, a piece of legislation that would crack down on illegals being released under the Alternatives to Detention program following the killing of 12-year-old Houston girl Jocelyn Nungaray, who was murdered by an illegal released under the program.\"As President Trump\u2019s head of the DOJ\u2019s Office of Legal Policy,\" Perez said that Reitz \"continued his mission-focused work to defend America\u2019s borders and sovereignty\" by reversing Biden-era border policies, fighting against sanctuary jurisdictions and supporting operations to crack down on cartel networks.In response, Reitz said he was \"deeply honored\" by the endorsement, calling it \"a sacred trust from the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to defend our country\u2019s sovereignty.\"TEXAS DEMOCRATS WHO FLED COULD FACE FELONY BRIBERY CHARGES, GOVERNOR SAYSHe vowed that the NBPC \"will have no stronger ally than me in the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office,\" which is one of the most powerful positions in Texas politics.He pledged to \"use every tool available under Texas law\" to \"help secure the border and stand in solidarity with the U.S. Border Patrol.\"The Texas Primary Elections will be on March 3, 2026. Reitz is facing off against state Sen. Mayes Middleton, an oil executive and conservative Republican serving in the Texas Senate. Middleton is also running on a pro-Trump, \"America first agenda,\" advancing policies such as suing sanctuary jurisdictions, cracking down on crime and gender ideology and eliminating waste, fraud and abuse in the government.This comes as the state of Texas is embroiled in a showdown between Republican and Democratic lawmakers over redistricting that has made national headlines. Following Democratic members of the Texas House of Representatives fleeing the state to break quorum to foil the GOP\u2019s redistricting plans, the attorney general has filed legal action to arrest the AWOL lawmakers and return them to Austin to resume voting.",

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Alexis Nungaray, the mother of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray, whose murder authorities say was at the hands of two illegal immigrants suspected to be Tren de Aragua gang members, told Fox News Digital that renaming a local wildlife refuge in her daughter\u2019s honor would mean \"the world\" to her family.\nJocelyn Nungaray was sexually assaulted and strangled to death, allegedly by two Venezuelan illegals, Franklin Jose Pena Ramos and Johan Jose Rangel Martinez, who were let through the southern border during the Biden administration. Her body was found tied up in a bayou in Houston.\nSince her daughter\u2019s murder, Alexis Nungaray has become a vocal advocate for increased border security and a supporter of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital, Nungaray said the tragic manner of Jocelyn\u2019s death \"takes away [from] who she was as a person.\" However, she said that the renaming of a 39,000-acre wildlife refuge on the Texas Gulf Coast preserves Jocelyn\u2019s memory for what she loved in life.\nTRUMP HONORS LIVES OF LAKEN RILEY, JOCELYN NUNGARAY WHILE CELEBRATING STRIDES ON SECURING BORDER\nTrump issued an executive order on March 5 renaming the former Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge in southeast Houston to the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge.\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, have since introduced bills to enshrine Trump\u2019s executive order into law, making it more difficult for a future president to change the name of the refuge back. The Senate has already passed the bill, and Babin is working to pass it in the House.\nBabin told Fox News Digital that his bill to codify Trump\u2019s renaming of the refuge after Jocelyn is receiving bipartisan support and that he expects it will be passed by the House soon and be immediately signed by the president.\n\"This is a beautiful place. And if we name it after her, I think we will preserve her legacy,\" he said.\n\"The main thing we need to remember is that this can never be allowed to happen again,\" he added. \"We get this thing in law, codified, no future president can ever undo this. And so, we will have a memory of what happens when you have bad policies that can create a system that will allow this to happen to innocent people like Jocelyn.\"\nTEXAS LAWMAKERS SEEK TO GET FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR BIDEN-ERA BORDER CONTROL EXPENSES\nNungaray said the effort to rename the refuge \"touches every part of my heart and my family's heart.\"\n\"Everyone who knew Jocelyn knew she loved animals so much, knew she loved nature, wildlife,\" explained Nungaray. \"She truly loved all animals and all creatures, and she wanted every animal to have a place to call home.\"\n\"Knowing that this national wildlife refuge is a place for a bunch of wild animals that travel through the country, and it is somewhere that they can call home, and it is somewhere that they can find a place of safety for them. I just know it would absolutely mean the world to her to know she has something in honor of her in that nature.\"\nShe said that seeing the signs going up around Houston bearing her daughter\u2019s name is \"bittersweet.\"\nTEXAS GANG MEMBERS SENTENCED FOR HUMAN SMUGGLING AFTER HIGH-SPEED BORDER CHASES\n\"I went out there to just go see what it was about, what it was like, and the amount of peace I felt just being there, it was just so pure and so peaceful,\" said Nungaray. \"Immediately I thought Jocelyn would love this. She would love to be out here.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE IMMIGRATION COVERAGE\n\"She wasn't just a 12-year-old girl who was strangled and left in a bayou of water,\" Nungaray went on. \"She was a very creative, talented, free-spirited 12-year-old girl.\"\nSmiling, Nungaray added that Jocelyn \"was very quirky\" and \"an old soul.\" She liked dressing in 1990s-style cargo jeans and Converse and loved listening to music from as far back as the 1940s and 1950s.\n\"She was very different and unique. She was an amazing friend,\" said Nungaray.\nNungaray said she is very grateful to Trump for both his support and for \"keeping his promises\" regarding immigration enforcement.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"I support immigration, but I say there's just a right way and a wrong way to do it,\" she explained. \"He's protecting the people, and he's taking consideration to the people, us the citizens and making sure we're safe and our kids are safe, women are safe, that we're all safe in our communities.\"\n\"We've still got a long way to go,\" she went on. \"But I will always advocate for her and be her voice and stand up for better border control and immigration laws. Because I know one-million percent Jocelyn's death should have been preventable.\""

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Three new states have signed agreements of varying intensity and substance, with one governor 1,700 miles away from Mexico saying his is effectively a \"border state\" due to its major fentanyl crisis.\nOn Wednesday, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey will announce one of the most wide-ranging agreements a state has forged with ICE yet, enlisting the West Virginia State Police, Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation and National Guard to aid immigration enforcement through the \"287(g)\" authority heralded by President Donald Trump.\nWest Virginia has long ranked among the states with the highest rates of drug-related deaths, a crisis that Morrisey says underscores the need to work with ICE to combat fentanyl trafficking.\n\"Under the Biden administration, millions of people poured into our country unlawfully and we had no knowledge about who they were, or whether they were a threat to our nation,\" Morrisey told Fox News Digital ahead of his expected Wednesday mid-morning announcement in Parkersburg.\nWY GOVERNOR GREENLIGHTS STATE TROOPERS TO JOIN ICE IN IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN\n\"West Virginia became an effective \u2018border state\u2019 due to the massive fentanyl problem caused by illegal immigration,\" he said.\nThe National Guard and state police will have \"task force\" authority to interrogate any person believed to be an illegal immigrant as to his right to remain in the U.S. \u2013 under the supervision or direction of the feds.\nOfficers will be able to process immigration-related violations for those arrested for state or federal offenses, and can also make warrantless arrests of any illegal immigrant in the officer\u2019s \"presence or view\" if that person is believed to be a flight risk in the interim of obtaining a warrant.\nMorrisey also authorized state law enforcement to serve immigration warrants, administer oaths and collect evidence for \"required alien processing,\" including fingerprints and suspect interviews.\nUnlike some other states, West Virginia law enforcement will also be able to issue immigration detainers, prepare documents for approval from federal ICE officers and arrest felonious aliens who have the penchant to escape.\nWest Virginia Division of Corrections will be permitted to hold immigrants on detainer, so long as the actions fall under federal auspices.\nCorrections officers will be able to follow the federal \"warrant officer model,\" which includes serving warrants for immigration violations in jails and transferring custody to the feds.\nFarther west, South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden recently announced cooperation with ICE to a lesser extent with his \"Operation Prairie Thunder\" public safety crackdown.\nRhoden, who rose to the governorship upon the departure of now-Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, announced earlier this month that Operation Prairie Thunder would be a \"comprehensive, targeted public safety initiative\" in the state \u2013 with a focus on the Sioux Falls metro area.\nThe anti-crime effort seeks to interdict drugs, probe gang activity and \"deter lawlessness.\"\nTEXAS BILL REQUIRING SHERIFFS TO COLLABORATE WITH ICE GIVEN INITIAL APPROVAL BY STATE HOUSE\nIt includes a \"comprehensive effort to support the work of [ICE], secure our borders and deport illegal alien criminals,\" according to a statement.\nThe South Dakota Highway Patrol will be able to assist ICE, and six South Dakota National Guard soldiers will be tasked with helping the agency with administrative functions.\n\"Our work alongside ICE boils down to this: Highway Patrol will support ICE with arrests,\" Rhoden said.\n\"The National Guard will support ICE with processing and administrative functions. And DOC will support ICE with transportation, identifying illegal immigrants in our prisons, and getting them paroled to ICE custody.\"\nIn Arkansas, a state law took effect this week that increases penalties for illegal immigrants committing \"serious felonies involving violence,\" among other stipulations.\nThe \"Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act,\" signed by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, also allowed Arkansas sheriffs to engage with ICE.\nIt allows law enforcement to apply via 287(g) to be authorized to serve immigration warrants on illegal immigrants already in custody for other offenses.\nArkansas State Police will go beyond the minimum cooperation required by the law, according to the Arkansas Times.\nCops will be able to stop people in public and ask them their immigration status \u2013 and potentially arrest suspected violators.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nA spokeswoman for the state police told the outlet that troopers must undergo training before any can work in an immigration-related capacity.\nThe regimen includes a 40-hour online course laying out officers\u2019 \"scope of authority, immigration law, civil rights law, cross-cultural issues, liability issues, complaint procedures and obligations under federal law,\" the spokeswoman said.\nSanders credited Trump with making border security a top priority and obtaining results.\n\"The Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act makes it clear: Arkansas will not tolerate violent, criminal illegals and will do our part to help the Trump administration keep our citizens safe,\" the former Trump press secretary said in a statement.\nThose states join Florida and Wyoming, the first two to sign substantive 287(g) agreements with ICE."

      "text": "Texas Democrats who fled the state to break quorum and disrupt redistricting efforts could face felony bribery charges, Republican Governor Greg Abbott suggested in an interview with Fox News Digital.\nAs some AWOL Democrats are reportedly planning to return in time for a second special legislative session to begin next week, Abbott, who previously served as the state's attorney general and sat on the state supreme court, told Fox News Digital that Texas is looking into whether they violated laws against bribery by taking money to break quorum.\n\"There had been some identification of some people paying for it,\" Abbott explained. \"I've got to tell you, it raises a serious legal question for these officeholders, and that is, they were promised money if they did break quorum. That would be a bribe that could lead to a felony charge.\"\nAccording to Abbott, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, also a Republican, is investigating whether the Democratic lawmakers could be hit with felony bribery charges.\n\"That also is something that the Texas attorney general is investigating and actually even got a temporary injunction from a court stopping any more money being given to these House members because of the potential bribe consequences,\" the governor explained.\nGOV. ABBOT STILL BEAT NEWSOM IN DISASTER RELIEF DESPITE TEXAS DEMOCRATS STALLING, HIDING OUT\nThis comes after Tarrant County District Judge Megan Fahey handed down a temporary restraining order last Friday against Robert Francis \"Beto\" O'Rourke and his group, Powered by People, over alleged \"unlawful fundraising practices\" tied to efforts to support Texas Democrats who fled the state \u2014 including funding air travel, lodging, logistics and daily fines.\nFahey's order bars O'Rourke or his group from continuing to fundraise or provide financial support to the fleeing Texas Democrats.\nIn the order, Fahey wrote that \"defendants have and will continue to engage in unlawful fundraising practices and utilization of political funds in a manner that either directly violates or causes Texas Democratic Legislators to violate [the law]\" and that contributors to the group \"have and continue to suffer irreparable harm through these unlawful acts because they are making political contributions that are being used to fund personal expenses and violate state law.\"\nIn light of this, Abbott warned that \"these House numbers are going to be facing not just the challenges of having to come back in deal with the consequences of their failure to be here but also deal with potential bribery charges against them.\"\nThe redistricting bill that has Democrats in an uproar was passed by the Texas Senate on Tuesday. If eventually passed by both chambers of the Texas legislature and signed into law by Abbott, Texas\u2019 new districting map will give Republicans an estimated five additional seats in Congress. Now, all that stands in the way are the rogue House Democrats.\nAbbott said he has Texas law enforcement \"scouring the streets of Texas right now to identify whether or not there are any Democrats remaining in the state of Texas.\"\n\"If they are, they will be arrested and taken to the Texas Capitol to try to make quorum,\" he said.\n\"There are 88 Republicans who are ready and able to work. We need 12 Democrats to show up. So, we're looking for 12 Democrats in the state of Texas, or if they're all out of state, we're looking to identify them and as you point out, using federal officials and others to assist us in that effort,\" he said.\nAbbott has faced heavy criticism from Democratic leaders and other governors from across the political aisle for not backing down on Texas\u2019 redistricting plans.\nO'ROURKE, SOROS-LINKED GROUPS FACE CALL FOR DOJ PROBE OVER ALLEGED FUNDING OF TEXAS DEM WALKOUT\nOn Monday, California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom called on President Donald Trump to \"call Greg Abbott and tell him to stand down.\"\n\"You are not \u2018entitled\u2019 to 5 congressional seats. If you do not call your lapdogs off, CA will act quickly and swiftly. We will go to the ballot. We will neutralize whatever gains you make. We will not stand by while you light Democracy on fire,\" said Newsom.\nIn another X post by Newsom\u2019s official press office page, the governor appeared to mimic Trump\u2019s idiosyncratic style of using all-caps and superlatives for many of his posts, writing, \"CALIFORNIA WILL NOW DRAW NEW, MORE \u2018BEAUTIFUL MAPS,\u2019 THEY WILL BE HISTORIC AS THEY WILL END THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY (DEMS TAKE BACK THE HOUSE!).\"\nThe post said Newsom would be holding a press conference this week on the matter and that it \"WILL BE DEVASTATING FOR \u2018MAGA.\u2019\"\nDEMS FACE SCRUTINY OVER CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATION GAPS IN BLUE STATES: 'DON'T HAVE CLEAN HANDS'\nAbbott, however, said he remains unfazed by such attacks from Democrats.\n\"Listen, these Democrats in other states are just completely out of control,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"They've been engaged in gerrymandering for decades in California, Illinois, New York, and elsewhere, and what they have lost touch with is the people.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHe pointed out that Texas\u2019 redistricting plans are within legal parameters, explaining, \"What's happened here is that the law changed in the state of Texas last year that authorized the state to be able to redraw these lines because of a legal change that doesn't require coalition districts.\"\n\"So, we're able to draw these districts in way in which representatives are going to be lining up with the values of voters of the state of Texas,\" he said, adding, \"What we're doing in our state is to make sure that we are going to have the districts represented by people who actually represent these voters.\"\nIn response, a spokesperson for Newsom directed Fox News Digital to another X post by the governor\u2019s office that mocked Abbott for saying the redistricting effort reflects the will of the voters, saying, \"Is GREG ABBOTT\u2019S POWER GRAB now going to the voters???\"\nSpokespersons for both Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and New York Governor Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, also referred Fox News Digital to previous comments made by the governors.\nHochul\u2019s office pointed to comments she made speaking on Fox News on Sunday in which she called the redistricting effort a \"legal insurrection.\"\n\"Texas, knock it off, we\u2019ll knock it off and let\u2019s get back to governing,\" said Hochul. \"But you want to play these games? We\u2019re not going to sit on the sidelines because we fight back.\"\nA spokesperson for Pritzker simply said, \"think he\u2019s been pretty clear,\" while referring Fox News Digital to prior comments by the governor.\nFox News Digital also reached out to the Texas House Democratic Caucus but did not immediately receive a response.\nFox News Digital's Alec Schemmel and Christina Shaw contributed to this report."

They now must be passed in the House, but it is unclear when that will be possible.\nDuring the vote, nine Democrats exited the floor in protest, but two remained on the floor, which allowed the Senate to reach a quorum.

If they can gerrymander now, they can and will do it before every election.\"\nTexas Republicans began pushing for new maps after the Trump administration directed state officials that they were in violation of the Voting Rights Act.\nCivil arrest warrants were issued by the Texas House Republican majority last week in an effort to compel the absent Democrats to return, but they are only enforceable within state lines and do not lead to jail time, since the warrants are not criminal.\nTEXAS DEMS ALSO SKIPPED TOWN IN 2021 TO AVOID A VOTE, AND SEVERAL CAUGHT COVID-19 IN DC\nHowever, Texas Republicans are seeking to utilize \"every legal remedy at our disposal to hold these rogue legislators accountable,\" Texas GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton said.\nIn addition to blocking Texas Republicans' redistricting bill, the exodus of Texas Democrats is obstructing crucial legislation from making its way through the legislature, state Sen.

Prior to his presidency, he served in the U.S. Senate and as vice president in former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. During his own presidency, the Biden-Harris administration prioritized issues such as climate change, Medicaid, infrastructure and LGBTQ+ initiatives.\nDuring the 2024 campaign cycle, Biden ran as the original Democratic nominee. Following his first presidential debate with Donald Trump, Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed his vice president at the time, Kamala Harris, for president. Harris lost the election, with many voters voicing concerns over immigration, border security and the economy as reasons for casting their votes for the Republican presidential candidate, President Donald Trump.\nAfter leaving office, Biden has largely kept to himself but has remained a topic of conversation in politics, mainly regarding his health, which was questioned throughout his presidency. Investigations and allegations of a cover-up regarding the truth of Biden\u2019s physical and mental well-being during his time in the White House have been brought forward.\nBiden\u2019s family has also been in the spotlight over the years, facing both tragedy and controversy. He lost his first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden, and his daughter, Naomi Biden, in a car accident in 1972. He later married Jill Biden in 1977. In 2015, his son Beau Biden died after a battle with brain cancer.\nBiden\u2019s other son, Hunter Biden, has faced personal battles with addiction over the years and has been at the center of numerous legal investigations, including over the contents of his laptop. Before leaving office, Biden pardoned Hunter for crimes he \"has committed or may have committed.\u201d"
