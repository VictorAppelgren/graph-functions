It was horrific. The screams were terrible. Four people flew off and went through the air. It was like a horror movie.\u201d\nDescribing the incident as \u201cserious\u201d, Lambeth Council said a \u201cthorough\u201d investigation is being carried out into the cause of the malfunction of one of the funfair rides.\nPreviously, a council spokesperson said: \u201cThe situation is being closely monitored.
