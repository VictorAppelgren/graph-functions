  "content": "A star-studded viral marketing stunt? This is \u201cHow It\u2019s Done.\u201d KPop Demon Hunters stars Rei Ami and Kevin Woo surprised fans with a concert from atop a double-decker bus in New York City on Saturday, August 23.\n\nFootage shared online by Netflix shows Rei Ami, who provides the singing voice of Huntr/x member Zoey, and Kevin Woo, who does so for Mystery Saja, singing \u201cHow It\u2019s Done.\u201d Woo also performed \u201cSoda Pop\u201d for the occasion.\n\nThe bus concert was part of KPop Demon Hunters Golden Weekend, which also involved Rei Ami joining costars Arden Cho (Rumi) and May Hong (Mira) in lighting up the Empire State Building on Friday, August 22.\n\n\u201cAnimation is a truly collaborative medium, and it\u2019s their voices, literally, their voices, that have brought Rumi and Mira and Zoey to life and put these songs on top of the charts,\u201d co-director and co-screenwriter Chris Appelhans told the New York Post. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for the fans and for these wonderful, talented women who made this movie such a beacon of connection and joy in the last few months.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI think it\u2019s really awesome to have a symbol like the Empire State Building lit golden, just to kind of bring everybody in the city together and have a moment with music connecting us all, because it does do that. And really, really happy and proud that the movies sort of played on most of that.\u201d\n\nThe Golden Weekend has gone global, too. Starting on Saturday and continuing today, Sunday, August 24, Netflix is hosting singalong screenings of Kpop Demon Hunters in movie theaters in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nDirected by Appelhans and Maggie Kang, KPop Demon Hunters follows the K-pop girl group Huntr/x on and off stage as they confront rival band Saja Boys, whose members are actually demons. The film has become a runway hit since its June 20 release, becoming Netflix\u2019s most-watched animated film of all time. Additionally, the Saja Boys\u2019 \u201cYour Idol\u201d topped the U.S. Spotify chart, making the fictional boy band the highest-charting male K-pop group in U.S. Spotify history, while Huntr/x\u2019s \u201cGolden\u201d reached No. 2, making the titular gals the highest-charting female K-pop group on Spotify, BBC News reports.",

      "text": "Fictional K-pop bands beat BTS and Blackpink in US charts\nA hugely popular K-pop musical animation has seen songs by its fictional bands top US music charts, beating real-life K-pop groups.\nKPop Demon Hunters is currently the most streamed movie on Netflix globally, clocking up more than 33 million views in just two weeks.\nOn Friday the song Your Idol by a boy band in the film, Saja Boys, topped the US Spotify chart. This makes them the highest charting male K-pop group in US Spotify history - surpassing kings of K-pop BTS.\nGolden, a track by the film's fictional girl group Huntr/x, hit number two on the chart, surpassing Blackpink as the highest-charting female K-pop group.\nThe film's soundtrack shot into the top 10 of the Billboard 200 in the US, making it the highest debut for a soundtrack so far this year.\nGolden is being released as an official single by Republic Records, and Netflix is submitting it for awards consideration, according to Variety.\nKPop Demon Hunters follows the adventures of superstar band Huntr/x.\nThe three members of the all-female group - Rumi, Mira, and Zoey - are secretly \"badass demon hunters\" who protect their legions of fans from supernatural dangers.\nDuring Huntr/x concerts, their music is used to protect the human world from the forces of darkness.\nBut rival band the Saja Boys, who are demons in disguise, are their arch enemies.\nJinu, Abby, Romance, Baby, and Mystery have been sent by demon king Gwi-ma to steal the souls of Huntr/x's fans.\nKPop Demon Hunters, which was produced by Sony Pictures Animation, was directed by Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans and was based on a story by Ms Kang.\nIts success should perhaps not be too surprising as top producers including Teddy Park, who has worked with Blackpink, and BTS collaborator Lindgren were part of the team that created the album.\nThe popularity of KPop Demon Hunters comes as South Korean mega-stars BTS are set to make their highly-anticipated comeback.\nThe seven-strong group announced this week that it will head to the US this month to start working on new music.\nThe band is due to release a new album and go on tour next year after all of its members completed their mandatory military service.\nMeanwhile, Blackpink is set to start its first all-stadium world tour on 5 July.\nThe band, which has not released an album together since 2022's Born Pink, is due to reveal a new song at the start of the Deadline World Tour."
