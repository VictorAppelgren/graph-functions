      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Cite Silver‑Specific Evidence** – The opening claim that silver will trend up 3–5 years is unsupported. Replace it with a citation to a recent silver‑price forecast (e.g., a Bloomberg or S&P Global Metals outlook) or a technical analysis that projects a $44–$46/oz range by 2027. If no such source exists, remove the 3–5 yr projection and state “silver has shown a 12–15 % year‑on‑year gain in 2025” with a proper source.\n\n2. **Link Inflation/Interest to Silver** – The paragraph linking real‑rate differentials to a “higher price floor” for silver needs a source that explicitly connects risk‑free rates to precious‑metal pricing (e.g., a research note on term‑premium effects on silver). If unavailable, rephrase to “higher real rates tend to support a hedge premium for silver” and cite a general macro‑finance text.\n\n3. **Clarify ICJ Impact** – The ICJ opinion (ZV3QI3K19) does not mention silver. Replace the sentence with a reference to a credible industry report that quantifies silver’s share in photovoltaic panels or battery cathodes (e.g., IEA or a mining‑tech white paper). If none, remove the sentence entirely.\n\n4. **Safe‑Haven Asset Claim** – The assertion that a low‑inflation regime will reduce demand for safe‑haven assets is unsubstantiated. Cite a study on safe‑haven flows (e.g., a CFA Institute paper) or remove the claim.\n\n5. **Fed Meeting Dates** – The next Fed meeting (2025‑10‑17) and CPI release (2025‑09‑15) are not in LF0UUL917. Insert a citation to the Fed’s official meeting calendar or a reputable news source (e.g., Reuters) for those dates. If you cannot find the exact dates, use a generic “upcoming Fed meeting” phrase without a specific date.\n\n6. **Forecast Source** – The $44–$46/oz forecast is currently unsupported. Add a citation to a forward‑looking silver‑price model or a financial‑institution outlook. If none, replace the forecast with a range derived from recent trend data and note the methodology.\n\n7. **Supply‑Shock Risk** – The risk of a geopolitical supply shock is not covered by ZV3QI3K19. Cite a recent mining‑industry report (e.g., S&P Global Mining Outlook) that discusses supply constraints in major silver‑producing regions.\n\n8. **Catalyst List** – “Mining‑sector supply reports” is not sourced. Add a citation to a recent mining‑data release (e.g., USGS Silver Production Report) or remove the bullet.\n\n9. **Confidence Statement** – The “moderate confidence” claim is not backed by any source. Either provide a confidence metric from a research note or rephrase to “confidence is moderate due to the sensitivity of silver to policy shifts” without a citation.\n\n10. **General Depth & Structure** – The draft lacks a clear first‑principles causal chain. Re‑organize into: (a) macro‑drivers (inflation, real rates, Fed policy), (b) silver’s role as hedge and industrial input, (c) structural catalysts (ICJ opinion, green‑tech demand), (d) risk factors, (e) quantitative outlook. Use bullet points for clarity, and embed inline citations after each factual claim.\n\n**Summary of Edits**  \n- Remove or replace unsupported claims.  \n- Add citations for silver price trend, real‑rate impact, ICJ relevance, safe‑haven flows, Fed dates, forecast, supply‑shock risk, and catalyst sources.  \n- Re‑structure paragraph into a logical, first‑principles narrative with clear causal links.  \n- Ensure every substantive claim has an explicit source (ID) or is eliminated.",
