  "content": "A number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed inflation holding steady, bolstering investor optimism for a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The data, which revealed that inflation remained at 2.7% for the year ending in July, was seen as a positive sign by investors. This stability increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve might lower interest rates at its upcoming September meeting. Lower interest rates can stimulate the economy by making borrowing cheaper for both consumers and businesses, which often translates into higher consumer spending. This is particularly beneficial for the Consumer Discretionary sector, which includes companies selling non-essential goods and services like apparel, travel, and electronics.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\u2022 Real Estate Services company Opendoor (NASDAQ:OPEN) jumped 5.4%.

Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\u2022 Specialized Consumer Services company WeightWatchers (NASDAQ:WW) jumped 3.1%. Is now the time to buy WeightWatchers? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nOpendoor\u2019s shares are extremely volatile and have had 87 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago when the stock dropped 22.7% on the news that the company issued a weak financial forecast for the upcoming third quarter, overshadowing its recent earnings report. The online real estate platform projected third-quarter revenue between $800 million and $875 million, a steep decline from the previous year and well below market expectations. Opendoor also guided for a return to a loss on an adjusted earnings basis. This gloomy forecast soured investor sentiment despite the company reporting better-than-expected revenue of about $1.6 billion for its second quarter. The poor outlook stemmed from a difficult home-buying environment, as high interest rates discouraged potential buyers and decreased sales.\n\nOpendoor is up 56% since the beginning of the year, but at $2.48 per share, it is still trading 22.7% below its 52-week high of $3.21 from July 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Opendoor\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $228.57.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

      "text": "Opendoor (OPEN)\nOpendoor keeps us up at night. Its poor revenue growth shows demand is soft and its cash burn makes us question its business model.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Opendoor Will Underperform\nFounded by real estate guru Eric Wu, Opendoor (NASDAQ:OPEN) offers a technology-driven, convenient, and streamlined process to buy and sell homes.\n- Sales tumbled by 32.3% annually over the last two years, showing consumer trends are working against its favor\n- Sales are expected to decline once again over the next 12 months as it continues working through a challenging demand environment\n- EBITDA losses may force it to accept punitive lending terms or high-cost debt\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Opendoor\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Opendoor\nAt $2.29 per share, Opendoor trades at 0.5x forward price-to-sales. The market typically values companies like Opendoor based on their anticipated profits for the next 12 months, but it expects the business to lose money. We also think the upside isn\u2019t great compared to the potential downside here - there are more exciting stocks to buy.\nPaying a premium for high-quality companies with strong long-term earnings potential is preferable to owning challenged businesses with questionable prospects.\n3. Opendoor (OPEN) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nTechnology real estate company Opendoor (NASDAQ:OPEN) reported Q2 CY2025 results topping the market\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 3.7% year on year to $1.57 billion. On the other hand, next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance of $837.5 million was less impressive, coming in 29.5% below analysts\u2019 estimates. Its GAAP loss of $0.04 per share was in line with analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nOpendoor (OPEN) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $1.57 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.50 billion (3.7% year-on-year growth, 4.2% beat)\n- EPS (GAAP): -$0.04 vs analyst estimates of -$0.03 (in line)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $23 million vs analyst estimates of $17.56 million (1.5% margin, 31% beat)\n- Revenue Guidance for Q3 CY2025 is $837.5 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $1.19 billion\n- EBITDA guidance for Q3 CY2025 is -$24.5 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of -$4.86 million\n- Operating Margin: -0.8%, up from -4.8% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow was $821 million, up from -$407 million in the same quarter last year\n- Homes Sold: 4,299, up 221 year on year\n- Market Capitalization: $1.79 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded by real estate guru Eric Wu, Opendoor (NASDAQ:OPEN) offers a technology-driven, convenient, and streamlined process to buy and sell homes.\nOpendoor's core business is its iBuying service, allowing homeowners to quickly sell their homes directly to Opendoor at a competitive price, bypassing the traditional real estate market's complexities and uncertainties. Homeowners can request an offer online, receive a data-driven valuation, and, if they accept, sell their home to Opendoor in a matter of days. This model has been appealing for its speed, convenience, and certainty.\nAfter purchasing homes, Opendoor makes necessary renovations, lists the properties for sale, and provides a streamlined buying experience for new homeowners. The company\u2019s digital platform enables buyers to browse listings, schedule tours, and purchase homes directly online, further simplifying the home-buying process.\nThe company leverages data analytics, machine learning algorithms, and market insights to value homes and streamline operations. This technology-first approach allows Opendoor to efficiently manage a large inventory of homes.\nIn addition to buying and selling homes, Opendoor provides ancillary services that complement its primary business. These include Opendoor Home Loans for financing, Opendoor-backed home warranties, and other services aimed at simplifying the transaction process.\n4. Real Estate Services\nTechnology has been a double-edged sword in real estate services. On the one hand, internet listings are effective at disseminating information far and wide, casting a wide net for buyers and sellers to increase the chances of transactions. On the other hand, digitization in the real estate market could potentially disintermediate key players like agents who use information asymmetries to their advantage.\nOpendoor's primary competitors include Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG), Redfin (NASDAQ:RDFN), Offerpad Solutions (NYSE:OPAD), and eXp World (NASDAQ:EXPI).\n5. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Over the last five years, Opendoor grew its sales at a sluggish 3% compounded annual growth rate. This was below our standard for the consumer discretionary sector and is a rough starting point for our analysis.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within consumer discretionary, product cycles are short and revenue can be hit-driven due to rapidly changing trends and consumer preferences. Opendoor\u2019s performance shows it grew in the past but relinquished its gains over the last two years, as its revenue fell by 32.3% annually.\nWe can dig further into the company\u2019s revenue dynamics by analyzing its number of homes sold, which reached 4,299 in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, Opendoor\u2019s homes sold averaged 21.1% year-on-year declines. Because this number is higher than its revenue growth during the same period, we can see the company\u2019s monetization has fallen.\nThis quarter, Opendoor reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 3.7% but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 4.2%. Company management is currently guiding for a 39.2% year-on-year decline in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 3.9% over the next 12 months. While this projection is better than its two-year trend, it\u2019s hard to get excited about a company that is struggling with demand.\n6. Operating Margin\nOpendoor\u2019s operating margin has been trending up over the last 12 months, but it still averaged negative 6% over the last two years. This is due to its large expense base and inefficient cost structure.\nThis quarter, Opendoor generated a negative 0.8% operating margin. The company's consistent lack of profits raise a flag.\n7. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nAlthough Opendoor\u2019s full-year earnings are still negative, it reduced its losses and improved its EPS by 34.7% annually over the last five years. The next few quarters will be critical for assessing its long-term profitability.\nIn Q2, Opendoor reported EPS at negative $0.04, up from negative $0.13 in the same quarter last year. Despite growing year on year, this print missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street is optimistic. Analysts forecast Opendoor\u2019s full-year EPS of negative $0.43 will reach break even.\n8. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nWhile Opendoor posted positive free cash flow this quarter, the broader story hasn\u2019t been so clean. Over the last two years, Opendoor\u2019s demanding reinvestments to stay relevant have drained its resources, putting it in a pinch and limiting its ability to return capital to investors. Its free cash flow margin averaged negative 8.8%, meaning it lit $8.85 of cash on fire for every $100 in revenue.\nOpendoor\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $821 million in Q2, equivalent to a 52.4% margin. Its cash flow turned positive after being negative in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t read too much into the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, causing temporary swings. Long-term trends trump fluctuations.\n9. Balance Sheet Risk\nDebt is a tool that can boost company returns but presents risks if used irresponsibly. As long-term investors, we aim to avoid companies taking excessive advantage of this instrument because it could lead to insolvency.\nOpendoor posted negative $94 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, and its $2.18 billion of debt exceeds the $789 million of cash on its balance sheet. This is a deal breaker for us because indebted loss-making companies spell trouble.\nWe implore our readers to tread carefully because credit agencies could downgrade Opendoor if its unprofitable ways continue, making incremental borrowing more expensive and restricting growth prospects. The company could also be backed into a corner if the market turns unexpectedly. We hope Opendoor can improve its profitability and remain cautious until then.\n10. Key Takeaways from Opendoor\u2019s Q2 Results\nRevenue and EBITDA in the quarter beat, but guidance was disappointing. Specifically, Q3 revenue guidance fell short of expectations and Q3 adjusted EBITDA guidance was even worse, missing by a large amount. Overall, this was a weaker quarter. The stock traded down 14.8% to $2.16 immediately following the results.\n11. Is Now The Time To Buy Opendoor?\nUpdated: August 11, 2025 at 10:27 PM EDT\nBefore investing in or passing on Opendoor, we urge you to understand the company\u2019s business quality (or lack thereof), valuation, and the latest quarterly results - in that order.\nWe see the value of companies helping consumers, but in the case of Opendoor, we\u2019re out. To kick things off, its revenue growth was weak over the last five years, and analysts expect its demand to deteriorate over the next 12 months. And while its projected EPS for the next year implies the company\u2019s fundamentals will improve, the downside is its cash burn raises the question of whether it can sustainably maintain growth. On top of that, its operating margins reveal poor profitability compared to other consumer discretionary companies.\nOpendoor\u2019s forward price-to-sales ratio is 0.5x. The market typically values companies like Opendoor based on their anticipated profits for the next 12 months, but it expects the business to lose money. We also think the upside isn\u2019t great compared to the potential downside here - there are more exciting stocks to buy.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $1.22 on the company (compared to the current share price of $2.29), implying they don\u2019t see much short-term potential in Opendoor."

      "text": "WeightWatchers (WW)\nWeightWatchers is up against the odds. Its plummeting sales and returns on capital show its profits are shrinking as demand fizzles out.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think WeightWatchers Will Underperform\nKnown by many for its old cable television commercials, WeightWatchers (NASDAQ:WW) is a wellness company offering a range of products and services promoting weight loss and healthy habits.\n- Annual revenue declines of 11.9% over the last five years indicate problems with its market positioning\n- Sales are projected to tank by 9.4% over the next 12 months as its demand continues evaporating\n- Unfavorable liquidity position could lead to additional equity financing that dilutes shareholders\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than WeightWatchers\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than WeightWatchers\nWeightWatchers is trading at $33.36 per share, or 28.2x forward EV-to-EBITDA. This multiple expensive for its subpar fundamentals.\nIt\u2019s better to invest in high-quality businesses with strong long-term earnings potential rather than to buy lower-quality companies with open questions and big downside risks.\n3. WeightWatchers (WW) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nPersonal wellness company WeightWatchers (NASDAQ:WW) reported Q2 CY2025 results topping the market\u2019s revenue expectations, but sales fell by 6.4% year on year to $189.2 million. On the other hand, the company\u2019s full-year revenue guidance of $692.5 million at the midpoint came in 1.1% below analysts\u2019 estimates. Its GAAP profit of $14.68 per share increased from $0.29 in the same quarter last year.\nWeightWatchers (WW) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $189.2 million vs analyst estimates of $178 million (6.4% year-on-year decline, 6.2% beat)\n- EBITDA guidance for the full year is $145 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $132 million\n- Operating Margin: 23.3%, up from 18.8% in the same quarter last year\n- Members: 3.2 million, down 600,000 year on year\n- Market Capitalization: $382.3 million\nCompany Overview\nKnown by many for its old cable television commercials, WeightWatchers (NASDAQ:WW) is a wellness company offering a range of products and services promoting weight loss and healthy habits.\nWW began as a weight loss-focused organization with Weight Watchers and has since rebranded into a comprehensive wellness brand. The company originally gained traction through its approach to weight management, combining dietary advice with group support meetings. This approach provided a community and accountability that differentiated it from other diet programs.\nInitially, WW's member growth was fueled by in-person group meetings and public speaking events, enticing members to join. The company then expanded by franchising the Weight Watcher program to its graduates.\nToday, WW's products include cookbooks, prepared food lines, and more, catering to a broader range of consumers. Its offerings are primarily subscription-based, and customers can participate both digitally and in person, receiving individualized support and coaching. WW also generates income from branded services and products, such as magazines, food guides, and licensing fees.\n4. Specialized Consumer Services\nSome consumer discretionary companies don\u2019t fall neatly into a category because their products or services are unique. Although their offerings may be niche, these companies have often found more efficient or technology-enabled ways of doing or selling something that has existed for a while. Technology can be a double-edged sword, though, as it may lower the barriers to entry for new competitors and allow them to do serve customers better.\nWeightWatchers's fitness and wellness peers include BODi (NYSE:BODY), MyFitnessPal, Noom, Cult.fit, and Trainerize.\n5. Revenue Growth\nExamining a company\u2019s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. WeightWatchers\u2019s demand was weak over the last five years as its sales fell at a 11% annual rate. This wasn\u2019t a great result and suggests it\u2019s a low quality business.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within consumer discretionary, product cycles are short and revenue can be hit-driven due to rapidly changing trends and consumer preferences. WeightWatchers\u2019s annualized revenue declines of 10% over the last two years align with its five-year trend, suggesting its demand has consistently shrunk.\nWe can dig further into the company\u2019s revenue dynamics by analyzing its number of members, which reached 3.2 million in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, WeightWatchers\u2019s members averaged 5.6% year-on-year declines. Because this number is higher than its revenue growth during the same period, we can see the company\u2019s monetization has fallen.\nThis quarter, WeightWatchers\u2019s revenue fell by 6.4% year on year to $189.2 million but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 6.2%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 8.6% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. Although this projection is better than its two-year trend, it\u2019s hard to get excited about a company that is struggling with demand.\n6. Operating Margin\nThis quarter, WeightWatchers generated an operating margin profit margin of 23.3%, up 4.5 percentage points year on year. This increase was a welcome development, especially since its revenue fell, showing it was more efficient because it scaled down its expenses.\n7. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nWeightWatchers\u2019s EPS grew at an astounding 62% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 11.9% annualized revenue declines. However, we take this with a grain of salt because its operating margin didn\u2019t improve and it didn\u2019t repurchase its shares, meaning the delta came from reduced interest expenses or taxes.\nIn Q2, WeightWatchers reported EPS at $14.68, up from $0.29 in the same quarter last year. We also like to analyze expected EPS growth based on Wall Street analysts\u2019 consensus projections, but there is insufficient data.\n8. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nWeightWatchers broke even from a free cash flow perspective over the last two years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. The divergence from its good operating margin stems from its capital-intensive business model, which requires WeightWatchers to make large cash investments in working capital and capital expenditures.\n9. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAlthough WeightWatchers hasn\u2019t been the highest-quality company lately because of its poor top-line performance, it found a few growth initiatives in the past that worked out wonderfully. Its five-year average ROIC was 24.2%, splendid for a consumer discretionary business.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, WeightWatchers\u2019s ROIC averaged 4 percentage point decreases over the last few years. We like what management has done in the past, but its declining returns are perhaps a symptom of fewer profitable growth opportunities.\n10. Balance Sheet Risk\nAs long-term investors, the risk we care about most is the permanent loss of capital, which can happen when a company goes bankrupt or raises money from a disadvantaged position. This is separate from short-term stock price volatility, something we are much less bothered by.\nWeightWatchers burned through $1.85 million of cash over the last year, and its $477.2 million of debt exceeds the $152.4 million of cash on its balance sheet. This is a deal breaker for us because indebted loss-making companies spell trouble.\nUnless the WeightWatchers\u2019s fundamentals change quickly, it might find itself in a position where it must raise capital from investors to continue operating. Whether that would be favorable is unclear because dilution is a headwind for shareholder returns.\nWe remain cautious of WeightWatchers until it generates consistent free cash flow or any of its announced financing plans materialize on its balance sheet.\n11. Key Takeaways from WeightWatchers\u2019s Q2 Results\nIt was great to see WeightWatchers\u2019s full-year EBITDA guidance top analysts\u2019 expectations. We were also glad its revenue outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. On the other hand, its full-year revenue guidance slightly missed. Overall, we think this was a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. The stock traded up 3.6% to $39.50 immediately after reporting.\n12. Is Now The Time To Buy WeightWatchers?\nUpdated: August 11, 2025 at 10:55 PM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in WeightWatchers.\nWeightWatchers falls short of our quality standards. To begin with, its revenue has declined over the last five years. And while its astounding EPS growth over the last five years shows its profits are trickling down to shareholders, the downside is its number of members has disappointed. On top of that, its cash burn raises the question of whether it can sustainably maintain growth.\nWeightWatchers\u2019s EV-to-EBITDA ratio based on the next 12 months is 28.2x. At this valuation, there\u2019s a lot of good news priced in - we think other companies feature superior fundamentals at the moment."

We prefer to invest in those.\n3. ThredUp (TDUP) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nOnline fashion resale marketplace ThredUp (NASDAQ:TDUP) reported Q2 CY2025 results exceeding the market\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 16.4% year on year to $77.66 million. On top of that, next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance ($74 million at the midpoint) was surprisingly good and 3.7% above what analysts were expecting. Its GAAP loss of $0.04 per share was $0.01 above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nThredUp (TDUP) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $77.66 million vs analyst estimates of $73.85 million (16.4% year-on-year growth, 5.2% beat)\n- EPS (GAAP): -$0.04 vs analyst estimates of -$0.05 ($0.01 beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $3.02 million vs analyst estimates of $2.4 million (3.9% margin, relatively in line)\n- The company lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $300 million at the midpoint from $286 million, a 4.9% increase\n- Operating Margin: -6.8%, up from -14.4% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow was -$2.94 million compared to -$3.88 million in the same quarter last year\n- Orders: 1.47 million, up 199,000 year on year\n- Market Capitalization: $1.00 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded to revolutionize thrifting, ThredUp (NASDAQ:TDUP) is a leading online fashion resale marketplace offering a wide selection of gently-used clothing and accessories.\nThe company addresses a large problem in fashion: people often have wardrobes filled with items they rarely wear. ThredUp solves this by creating a market to buy and sell used fashion goods, promoting a circular fashion economy that minimizes waste and reduces the environmental footprint of the industry.\nGiven the used nature of products listed on its marketplace, the company places a strong emphasis on quality control. Every item is inspected to ensure secondhand shopping on its platform is as reliable as buying new. Combined with a user-friendly interface and transparent pricing, ThredUp makes the thrifting experience accessible and convenient.\nThe company generates revenue by charging sellers a commission or processing fee for each item they sell on the platform. This fee varies depending on the selling price of the item, typically ranging from 5% to 20% of the sale price.\n4. Apparel and Accessories\nThanks to social media and the internet, not only are styles changing more frequently today than in decades past but also consumers are shifting the way they buy their goods, favoring omnichannel and e-commerce experiences. Some apparel and accessories companies have made concerted efforts to adapt while those who are slower to move may fall behind.\nThredUp\u2019s main competitors are Poshmark (owned by Naver Corporation, KRX:035420), The RealReal (NASDAQ:REAL), Depop (owned by Etsy NASDAQ:ETSY), and Mercari (OTCMKTS:MCARY).\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Over the last five years, ThredUp grew its sales at a sluggish 8.3% compounded annual growth rate. This was below our standard for the consumer discretionary sector and is a tough starting point for our analysis.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within consumer discretionary, product cycles are short and revenue can be hit-driven due to rapidly changing trends and consumer preferences. ThredUp\u2019s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 1.8% over the last two years was below its five-year trend.\nThredUp also discloses its number of orders, which reached 1.47 million in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, ThredUp\u2019s orders averaged 1.3% year-on-year declines. Because this number is lower than its revenue growth during the same period, we can see the company\u2019s monetization has risen.\nThis quarter, ThredUp reported year-on-year revenue growth of 16.4%, and its $77.66 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 5.2%. Company management is currently guiding for a 20.3% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 8.3% over the next 12 months. While this projection implies its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average.\n6. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses \u2013 everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It\u2019s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\nThredUp\u2019s operating margin has been trending up over the last 12 months, but it still averaged negative 13.5% over the last two years. This is due to its large expense base and inefficient cost structure.\nIn Q2, ThredUp generated a negative 6.8% operating margin. The company's consistent lack of profits raise a flag.\n7. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nAlthough ThredUp\u2019s full-year earnings are still negative, it reduced its losses and improved its EPS by 34.3% annually over the last five years. The next few quarters will be critical for assessing its long-term profitability.\nIn Q2, ThredUp reported EPS at negative $0.04, up from negative $0.13 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street is optimistic. Analysts forecast ThredUp\u2019s full-year EPS of negative $0.49 will reach break even.\n8. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nOver the last two years, ThredUp\u2019s demanding reinvestments to stay relevant have drained its resources, putting it in a pinch and limiting its ability to return capital to investors. Its free cash flow margin averaged negative 2.3%, meaning it lit $2.25 of cash on fire for every $100 in revenue.\nThredUp burned through $2.94 million of cash in Q2, equivalent to a negative 3.8% margin. The company\u2019s cash burn was similar to its $3.88 million of lost cash in the same quarter last year.\nOver the next year, analysts predict ThredUp\u2019s cash conversion will slightly improve. Their consensus estimates imply its breakeven free cash flow margin for the last 12 months will increase to 2.7%, giving it more optionality.\n9. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nThredUp\u2019s five-year average ROIC was negative 44.7%, meaning management lost money while trying to expand the business. Its returns were among the worst in the consumer discretionary sector.\n10. Balance Sheet Assessment\nThredUp reported $47.58 million of cash and $56.45 million of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $12.13 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view ThredUp\u2019s 0.7\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $1.21 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n11. Key Takeaways from ThredUp\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly ThredUp blew past analysts\u2019 EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also glad its full-year revenue guidance trumped Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Zooming out, we think this was a solid print. The stock traded up 7.8% to $10.47 immediately after reporting.\n12. Is Now The Time To Buy ThredUp?\nUpdated: August 11, 2025 at 10:18 PM EDT\nBefore deciding whether to buy ThredUp or pass, we urge investors to consider business quality, valuation, and the latest quarterly results.\nThredUp falls short of our quality standards. First off, its revenue growth was uninspiring over the last five years. And while its projected EPS for the next year implies the company\u2019s fundamentals will improve, the downside is its number of orders has disappointed. On top of that, its relatively low ROIC suggests management has struggled to find compelling investment opportunities.\nThredUp\u2019s EV-to-EBITDA ratio based on the next 12 months is 94.1x. This multiple tells us a lot of good news is priced in - we think other companies feature superior fundamentals at the moment.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $13 on the company (compared to the current share price of $10.00).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

Notable gains were seen in companies like Opendoor, ThredUp, and WeightWatchers, with Opendoor's shares rising 5.4% despite a weak financial forecast. However, analysts express caution regarding these companies' long-term viability due to declining revenues and profitability concerns.",
