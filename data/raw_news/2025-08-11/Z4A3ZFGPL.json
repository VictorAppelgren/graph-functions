  "content": "Costco\u2019s \u2018Revolutionary\u2019 New Fruity Drink Has Shoppers Pleasantly Surprised: \u2018Better Than I Expected\u2019 originally appeared on Parade.\n\nParade aims to feature only the best products and services. If you buy something via one of our links, we may earn a commission.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever avoided protein shakes because of their thick, chalky texture, Costco might have just found the solution. A new fizzy drink from Genius Gourmet is turning heads not only because it delivers 30 grams of protein per can, but because it looks and feels more like sparkling water than a traditional shake.\n\nThe Sparkling Clear Protein Drink, which recently rolled out to Costco locations nationwide, is already going viral among shoppers who are surprised by how smooth and refreshing it tastes. At $28.99 for a 15-pack of 12-ounce cans, it\u2019s shaping up to be one of the most buzzed-about beverage launches of the season.\n\n\ud83c\udf73 SIGN UP to get delicious recipes, handy kitchen hacks & fun food news in our daily Pop Kitchen newsletter \ud83c\udf73\n\nInstead of the heavy, milky consistency that protein shakes are known for, this drink is completely translucent and lightly carbonated. That\u2019s thanks to Genius Gourmet\u2019s use of ultra-filtered whey protein isolate, which allows the beverage to stay clear while still packing in a full 30 grams of protein. It\u2019s also lactose-free, sugar-free and just 130 calories per can, making it an easy option for post-workout recovery or a mid-afternoon pick-me-up.\n\nUser @costcobuys spotted it in the store:\n\nRight now, the drink comes in a single flavor, blue raspberry lemonade, but shoppers say it\u2019s surprisingly easy to sip. Many compare it to flavored sparkling water with a touch of sweetness, which comes from sucralose. The formula also includes natural flavors and mushroom extract as a preservative.\n\nFor those who\u2019ve been searching for a high-protein option without the thick texture, this launch is a game changer. Whether you\u2019re training for a race, looking to boost your daily protein intake or simply want a more refreshing way to stay fueled, this drink delivers without feeling heavy.\n\nCostco fans on social media have been quick to share their first impressions. One commenter wrote, \"We got them today and actually loved them! I have no idea how they have 30 grams of protein in them.\" Another said, \"Better than I expected\u2014tastes like a soda, but without the guilt.\u2019\n\nOthers aren't so sure about the flavor, calling it \"too sweet.\" I guess I'll have to buy some to find out for myself is this really is too good to be true!\n\nThe drink\u2019s light, bubbly texture seems to be the main draw, with many people admitting they usually skip protein shakes altogether. Now, they say they\u2019ve finally found something they\u2019ll look forward to drinking every day.\n\nProtein drinks have long been a staple for athletes and busy professionals, but this launch proves there\u2019s still room for innovation. By swapping the creamy shake for a fizzy, fruity beverage, Genius Gourmet has created something that feels fresh and approachable\u2014even for people who never thought they\u2019d enjoy a protein drink.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been on the fence about adding more protein to your diet, this might be the easiest (and tastiest) way to start.\n\nRelated: Trader Joe\u2019s \u2018Super Refreshing\u2019 New Drink Tastes Just Like a Starbucks Favorite, Fans Say\n\nCostco\u2019s \u2018Revolutionary\u2019 New Fruity Drink Has Shoppers Pleasantly Surprised: \u2018Better Than I Expected\u2019 first appeared on Parade on Aug 11, 2025\n\nThis story was originally reported by Parade on Aug 11, 2025, where it first appeared.",
