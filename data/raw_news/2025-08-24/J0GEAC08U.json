  "description": "Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s seventh studio album, \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend,\u201d and Marvel\u2019s \u201cThunderbolts\u201d starring Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan are some of the new television, films, music and games headed to a device near you",
  "content": "\u2014 Helen Mirren, Pierce Brosnan, Ben Kingsley and Celia Imrie play elderly amateur sleuths in Chris Columbus\u2019 \u201cThe Thursday Murder Club\u201d (Netflix, Thursday). In the film, based on Richard Osman\u2019s 2020 novel, the group attempts to solve a crime from their seniors\u2019 residence, Coopers Chase. Expect a cozy murder mystery, with mature star power.\n\n\u2014 Scott McGehee and David Siegel\u2019s \u201cThe Friend\u201d (Monday on Paramount+) stars Naomi Watts as a New York writer who reluctantly inherits the dog of her deceased mentor (Bill Murray). The dog isn\u2019t just any dog, either, but a mammoth Great Dane named Apollo. The adaptation of Sigrid Nunez\u2019s National Book Award-winning novel is very much a dog movie, but it\u2019s also one about processing grief. In her review, AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr called it \u201cone of those movies people complain they don\u2019t make anymore, although its existence is a reminder that they do still make \u2018them,\u2019 meaning smart, emotionally authentic stories about people who seem real.\u201d\n\nNew music to stream from Aug. 25-31\n\n\u2014 Who's a good girl? Sabrina Carpenter hopes to be when she releases her seventh studio album, \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend.\u201d It will drop almost exactly a year after she released breakthrough album \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d which spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Carpenter has been enlisting a golden retriever puppy and fans to unveil her tracklist on social media. The lead single, \u201cManchild,\u201d hit No. 1 on the charts in June.\n\n\u2014 If you needed a sign of the growing clout of Blood Orange, look no further than the extensive collaborators on his upcoming fifth album, \u201cEssex Honey.\u201d There's Lorde, Caroline Polachek, Daniel Caesar, Mustafa, Turnstile\u2019s Brendan Yates, Tariq Al-Sabir, Wet\u2019s Kelly Zutrau and the actors Naomi Scott and Amandla Stenberg. He even convinced author Zadie Smith to sing. Blood Orange (aka songwriter Dev Hynes, who combines R&B, pop, electronica, indie and funk) says he's exploring his childhood in Essex, England, and calls it a \u201csoundtrack created from a dreamscape of a journey working through grief.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Stans of stans, unite. \u201cStans,\u201d the Marshall Mathers-produced documentary about a cast of superfans of Eminem, directed by Steven Leckart, will debut on Paramount+ on Tuesday. Eminem named the phenomenon 25 years ago with the release of his song \u201cStan\u201d about an obsessive fan, which prompted the Oxford English Dictionary to eventually add the term. The film \"offers a raw, loud and revealing journey across Eminem\u2019s career \u2014 and the passionate audience that has grown with him.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Apple TV+ has a new music competition series featuring iconic songs by some of the world\u2019s biggest Western pop stars as they get the K-pop treatment. \u201cKPopped\u201d features K-pop groups ITZY, JO1, Kiss of Life, Blackswan, STAYC, KEP1ER, Ateez and Billlie teamed up with Western artists like Meg, Kesha, Patti Labelle, Kylie Minogue, the Spice Girls\u2019 Mel B and Emma Bunton, Vanilla Ice, Taylor Dayne, Eve, J Balvin, Ava Max, Boyz II Men, Boy George, TLC and Jess Glynne. Together, offer new spins on classic songs like \u201cIce Ice Baby,\u201d \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d \u201cWaterfalls,\u201d \u201cMotownphilly\u201d and \u201cKarma Chameleon.\u201d All eight episodes stream Friday.\n\nNew series to stream from Aug. 25-31\n\n\u2014 The sci-fi comedy \"Upload\" hits Prime Video on Monday for its fourth and final season. Starring Robbie Amell, the series takes place in the not-too-distant future where humans can pay to upload their mind to a virtual afterlife when they die. Amell's Nathan uploads in the first episode and ends up falling for Nora, a human concierge assigned to help his transition go smoothly. Talk about a long-distance relationship! Created by Greg Daniels, who also created \u201cThe Office,\u201d the show deals with themes of class and ethics in technology. Daniels has said he came up with the idea in the late 1980s. It's fascinating to think that his \u201cwhat if\u201d is now, maybe, conceivable?\n\n\u2014 \u201cMy Funeral\u201d is a new Icelandic dark comedy about a man who on the same day as his retirement, a cantankerous man learns he has a incurable brain tumor, and decides to host his own funeral. \u201cMy Funeral\u201d premieres Tuesday on MhZ Choice, a streaming service for international titles.\n\n\u2014 More flower sprinkles! Season 2 of \u201cWith Love, Meghan,\u201d a lifestyle series from the Duchess of Sussex arrives on Netflix on Tuesday. The new episodes feature celebs like Chrissy Teigen, Tan France and chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, who visit the former actor living well in Montecito. In the trailer, we see Meghan make cocktails, bake thumbprint cookies with fresh preserves, and roast s'mores. Recently it was announced that Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, have extended their deal with Netflix.\n\n\u2014 Prime Video's \u201cThe Terminal List\u201d rewinds with a new prequel series starring Taylor Kitsch's Navy SEAL-turned CIA operative. \u201cThe Terminal List: Dark Wolf\u201d debuts Wednesday. Chris Pratt (who is also working on a second season of the original) also reprises his character. The franchise is based on books by Jack Carr.\n\n\u2014 Thanks to celebrities like Halle Berry and Naomi Watts, menopause has become a more mainstream topic in recent years and a new comedy pokes fun at a woman's journey through what grandma used to call \u201cthe change\u201d or \u201cthe change of life.\u201d \u201cMiddlehood\u201d stars Elena Wohl as a woman going through a bit of a midlife crisis as she deals aging. The eight-episode series premieres on YouTube beginning Wednesday.\n\n\u2014 For those hooked on the love triangle between Belly and brothers Jeremiah and Conrad in Prime Video's \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty,\u201d Netflix has a returning title to offer. Season two of \u201cMy Life with the Walter Boys\u201d arrives on the streamer on Thursday. It follows a teen who moves in with family friends after her parents die and finds herself torn between two brothers. \u201cWalter Boys\u201d is based on a book by Ali Novak that was first published on Wattpad.\n\nNew video games to play from Aug. 25-31\n\n\u2014 The Knightling is hardly your typical dragon slayer \u2014 for starters, he doesn\u2019t even have a sword. He does, however, have a magic shield that he can ride, kind of like a flying saucer. That\u2019s enough to get him around the exotic land of Clesseia as he searches for the legendary Sir Lionstone. His adventure, from Dutch studio Twirlbound, mixes exploration, puzzles and combat across a vast open world, and its colorful animation is reminiscent of the classic Sly Cooper series. The journey begins Thursday on PlayStation 5, Xbox X/S and PC.\n\n\u2014 Joe Musashi, on the other hand, has a full assortment of ninja weaponry, including a katana, shuriken and martial arts skills. Joe is the star of Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, Sega\u2019s attempt to revive a franchise that debuted in the arcades back in 1987. The original was a straightforward hack-and-slash, but the reboot offers more parkour challenges across a wide-ranging 2D maze that\u2019s packed with secrets. Fans will also be thrilled to see the return of Yamato, a dog that can transform into a creature big enough to carry Joe out of trouble. Shinobi returns Friday on PlayStation 5/4, Xbox X/S/One, Switch and PC.",

      "text": "Movie Review: Naomi Watts and a Great Dane mourn Bill Murray in \u2018The Friend\u2019\nMovie Review: Naomi Watts and a Great Dane mourn Bill Murray in \u2018The Friend\u2019\nHaving it all means different things to everyone, but a rent-controlled apartment in Manhattan is probably pretty close to a universal dream \u2014 even for non-New Yorkers. It\u2019s easy enough, then, to understand the profound conundrum facing Iris (Naomi Watts), a writer and professor who suddenly finds herself with a 150-pound Great Dane ward after an unexpected death in \u201cThe Friend.\u201d\nNot only is her place a mere 500 square feet, but it\u2019s also one of those pesky buildings in which dogs are not welcome. Not even the cute, well-behaved ones.\nDog lovers may find the choice simple (perhaps it should be) and the apartment rules cruelly restrictive, but this is a single woman living a writer\u2019s life in one of the most expensive cities in the world. And now she\u2019s grappling with the idea of saying goodbye to a major part of her identity because her dear friend and mentor Walter (Bill Murray) died without leaving behind a plan for his beloved dog Apollo (Bing). Or perhaps that\u2019s not entirely true: Iris was the plan. Walter just didn\u2019t tell her that before he killed himself. She\u2019s not even a self-proclaimed dog person.\nThe film is an adaptation of Sigrid Nunez\u2019s National Book Award-winning novel of the same name, made by filmmaking duo Scott McGehee and David Siegel (\u201cWhat Maisie Knew\u201d). Its appeal isn\u2019t mysterious \u2014 it\u2019s a classic New York movie about the most romantic New York profession, writing, with actors like Murray and Watts (and Bing) leading the charge.\nThese are characters who\u2019ve lived lives, too. Walter died a celebrated but problematic author, known for his womanizing and multiple marriages. He left behind not just Apollo but three ex-wives (Carla Gugino, Constance Wu and Noma Dumezweni), a grown daughter (Sarah Pidgeon) not conceived in wedlock and a misconduct accusation. Iris and Walter also had a dalliance at one point, but settled into a friendship \u2014 his deepest, we\u2019re told.\nThis is perhaps the most mysterious element of the story \u2014 partially on purpose, since Walter is dead for most of the movie. We see him only in limited flashbacks and Murray wears the part well: a freewheeling, egotistical genius whose ways have skipped out of sync with the times but whose charisma keeps him surrounded by throngs of admirers. And afterward, Iris is questioning what it all meant and perhaps how well she really did know this man: It\u2019s a kind of grief, that of a friend, that isn\u2019t regularly explored in films.\nIris is the most radical of female characters, even, depressingly in 2025: a single woman of a certain age and no ambition to be anything else. Watts plays her with grace and dignity, as she struggles with her own writing. Even Apollo has a past: Walter found him alone in Central Park one day and took him in as his own. When Walter\u2019s gone, Apollo is perhaps the most outwardly depressed about the loss. His days are spent either sitting sadly on Iris\u2019 bed with literal hangdog eyes or acting out and destroying things in her apartment.\nIt\u2019s no spoiler to say that they\u2019ll both have to go on a journey to realizing that perhaps they can find solace in one another in the devastating absence of their larger-than-life friend. McGehee and Siegel avoid hokey dog movie cliches and easy jokes about ownership learning curves and instead present a rather straightforward portrait of what it\u2019s like to suddenly inherit a very large living creature.\n\u201cThe Friend\u201d stretches on a bit too long, but it\u2019s done with such care and a kind heart that it\u2019s not hard to give it two hours of your time. It\u2019s also one of those movies people complain they don\u2019t make anymore, although its existence is a reminder that they do still make \u201cthem,\u201d meaning smart, emotionally authentic stories about people who seem real. They just might require a little more effort to find than they used to.\n\u201cThe Friend,\u201d a Bleecker Street release now in limited release and in theaters nationwide Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201ca sexual reference and language.\u201d Running time: 123 minutes. Three stars out of four."

Between sweeping anthems, folkloric serenades and electronic teases, the artist captures the transcendent and elusive forces of love.\nIncorporating singles known for their catchy rhythms, like 2021\u2019s \u201cBunny is a Rider\u201d and last summer\u2019s \u201cSunset,\u201d into a swath of eerie meditations, like \u201cCrude Drawing of an Angel\u201d and \u201cHopedrunk Everasking,\u201d Polachek imbues pastoral harmonies and vocal flares into her romanticism, primeval drifting into the future.\nPolachek lures listeners in with the playful \u201cWelcome To My Island\u201d before shifting toward the atmospheric weight of \u201cPretty Impossible\u201d that lends its synthetic beats to the impassioned quest \u201cI Believe\u201d that flows into the emotional longing of \u201cButterfly Net.\u201d Br\u00ecghde Chaimbeul\u2019s earthy bagpipe flourishes in multiple songs, and fellow artists Dido and Grimes collaborate in the fluttery \u201cFly to You.\u201d While instrumental sharpness singles her album out, Polachek\u2019s lyrics the elevate the romantic effect, either with magical realism, cheeky puns or plain desire. Throughout, Polachek captures love\u2019s shape-shifting essence.\nAmong most listeners, Polachek is known for ethereal dance music that casts sunshine into an alternative \u201890s pop groove. Her opera-trained voice flows between octaves with a precision mistaken for auto-tune. She\u2019s been likened to this generation\u2019s Kate Bush. Once a part of pop-group Chairlift of the early \u201800s, Polachek\u2019s been charging forward with her own sound, and \u201cDesire, I Want To Turn Into You\u201d proves her timeless relevance.\n___"

The last Grammy for best recording package went to \u201cBrat,\u201d the Charli xcx album whose distinctive cover was immediately embraced by pop culture and meme creators.\n\u201cThe Academy\u2019s top priority is to represent the music people that we serve each year,\u201d Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy said in a statement. \u201cThat entails listening carefully to our members to make sure our rules and guidelines reflect today\u2019s music and allow us to accurately recognize as many deserving creators as possible.\u201d\nCarpenter revealed the title and release date for her new album, \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend,\u201d on Wednesday. The image shows Carpenter, dressed in a black dress and high heels, kneeling on the ground in a dog-like pose while an unseen person pulls her by the hair. On social media, some fans said the image was demeaning while others argued it was satirical.\nThe album would be eligible for the new category if she releases \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend\u201d on Aug. 29, as promised. The Grammy eligibility period closes the next day.\nOther Grammy changes include the creation of a best traditional country album category, while the existing best country album category has been renamed best contemporary country album. (Beyonc\u00e9 won best country album at the 2025 Grammy Awards for \u201cCowboy Carter.\u201d)\nThe best new artist category has also been expanded to include acts who were featured on previous album of the year nominees, so long as they fall below 20% of the album\u2019s music.\nThe Grammys will be held Feb. 1 at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, with nominations set to be announced on Nov. 7."

That\u2019s that her espresso.\nThe 25-year-old pop sensation\u2019s smash hit of the summer, \u201cEspresso\u201d \u2014 with its grammatical mystery of an earworm line, \u201cThat\u2019s that me espresso\u201d \u2014 gave listeners a taste of her newest album, \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet.\u201d The former Disney Channel actor\u2019s sixth studio album follows an explosive year marked with successes, from opening for Taylor Swift on her Eras Tour to performing at Coachella.\nShe\u2019s confident, she\u2019s radiant, and she\u2019ll air out all your dirty laundry in a breakup song if you wrong her.\nIn the flirty, fun and wholly unserious \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d Carpenter\u2019s soprano vocals take humorous jabs at exes and drop innuendos with an air of cheeky innocence. Sugary songs like \u201cTaste\u201d and \u201cJuno\u201d incorporate enough NSFW references to have listeners blushing almost as much as the rosy-cheeked singer.\nThere\u2019s a country twang to some tracks, like \u201cSlim Pickins,\u201d an acoustic number bemoaning the difficulties of finding a good man and having to settle for a guy who \u201cdoesn\u2019t even know the difference between \u2018there,\u2019 \u2018their\u2019 and \u2018they are.\u2019\u201d\nCarpenter shows a more vulnerable side with ballads like \u201cDumb & Poetic\u201d and \u201cLie to Girls,\u201d in which she drops her carefree front to sing unguarded lyrics airing out grievances against an ex.\n\u201cDon\u2019t think you understand,\u201d she sings in \u201cDumb & Poetic.\u201d \u201cJust \u2019cause you act like one doesn\u2019t make you a man.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s when pop tracks blend into R&B that Carpenter really shines. Her breathy vocals work so well on such tracks as \u201cGood Graces\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Smile,\u201d reminiscent of Ariana Grande or Mariah Carey.\nWhich direction will she take next? Only Carpenter knows. Isn\u2019t that sweet? Carpenter guesses so. That is, after all, that her espresso."

      "text": "Menopause discussions are coming into the open, with a boost from celebs\nMenopause discussions are coming into the open, with a boost from celebs\nPop culture depictions of puberty are common. TV, movies, books and music all frequently showcase the tumult of tweens coming of age.\nUntil recently, the same could not be said of the reverse puberty many women experience as their hormones shift approaching the end of their periods in middle age.\nThen along comes former first lady Michelle Obama talking with People magazine about taking hormone replacement therapy and giving up on her toned \u201cMichelle Obama arms.\u201d Drew Barrymore has her first hot flash during an interview on her talk show. Oprah Winfrey hosts a panel of celebrities and doctors to discuss menopause.\nDoctors stress that women should carefully consider where they get their medical advice, and note that some celebrities are also selling products or services. But they welcome more open conversations about menopause, which can inform women about treatments and change stereotypes of what menopause looks like.\nMany women remain unsure how to navigate the myriad symptoms \u2014 commonly including hot flashes, insomnia and mood changes \u2014 that begin in perimenopause, the years of transition leading up to menopause. Menopause itself is defined as the one-year mark after a woman\u2019s final period.\nJen Gunter, a gynecologist and author of \u201cThe Menopause Manifesto: Own Your Health with Facts and Feminism\u201d (Citadel Press), notes that menopause is complicated, and the desire to make it simple might be part of the appeal of celebrity advocates.\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want a magic wand?\u201d Gunter said, warning about medical advice from people without the training to dispense it, or who might have a conflict of interest. \u201cIt comes down to, \u2018Who is the expert?\u2019\u201d\nBarrymore is among a group of celebrities investing in menopause telemedicine company Evernow. Actor Judy Greer is a founder of Wile, which sells supplements. Actor Naomi Watts is a founder of menopause products site Stripes.\nCelebrities can help, however, by introducing issues long considered shameful, Gunter said.\nJulie Holland, a psychiatrist and author of the book \u201cMoody Bitches\u201d (Penguin), about how hormonal fluctuations affect women\u2019s lives, sees a growing willingness over the past decade to talk about menopause, and also about women\u2019s hormones and reproductive health more broadly.\n\u201cThis is a zeitgeist tipping point,\u201d she said.\nShe noted with delight that the blockbuster \u201cBarbie\u201d movie concludes with Barbie excitedly going to see a gynecologist. And Holland is encouraged by the way her daughter, Molly, talks with her Gen Z friends.\n\u201cMy daughter\u2019s generation is giving each other a lot of body positivity messages,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen are getting messages to destigmatize a lot of things.\u201d\nOne common complaint that lands women in her care is difficulty sleeping, Holland said. They often don\u2019t realize the root cause is hot flashes because they aren\u2019t waking up sweaty, and they feel transformed when they\u2019re able to get good sleep again.\nIt\u2019s also common for women to enter psychiatric care for the first time during the menopausal transition, Holland said, and they frequently do so feeling like something is wrong with them, rather than understanding it\u2019s a season of life.\n\u201cNobody makes that same space for women like they do for puberty,\u201d Holland said, noting that could be changing. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing body of people aging who aren\u2019t shamed.\u201d\nBecause women\u2019s menopause concerns are frequently ignored, that leaves them open to quick-fix miracle cures, according to Mary Claire Haver, an OB-GYN and author of \u201cThe New Menopause,\u201d coming in 2024 from Rodale Books. On her website, she lists four red flags to watch for on snake oil products: claims with no supporting medical evidence, lack of peer review on scientific data, manipulation of emotions and celebrity endorsements.\nOnce women start talking about their experiences, they are often relieved to learn more about the treatments available, said Joanna Strober, an entrepreneur who co-founded Midi Health, a virtual health care clinic specializing in menopause.\nAs she prepared to speak at the recent Fortune Most Powerful Women conference, she wore a \u201cMenopause is hot\u201d T-shirt. Strober said powerful, educated women in attendance kept asking similar questions: I\u2019m confused about whether I should take hormone replacement therapy. My doctor prescribed anxiety medicine and therapy, but it\u2019s not helping. Can you tell me what to do?\nParticipants in Midi\u2019s menopause webinars for companies say they love seeing women they work with asking questions about the same symptoms they\u2019re experiencing, she said. Women at the peak of their careers might be loath to admit they\u2019re having brain fog or difficulty focusing, or to talk about anything that could call into question their ability to perform.\n\u201cHaving these conversations at work can help normalize it,\u201d Gunter agreed.\n\u201cWe culturally think of older women as grandmothers, not as CEOs,\u201d Gunter said. \u201cWhen your periods go away, you are invisible to society.\u201d\nWinfrey is decidedly not invisible. Earlier this year, the media powerhouse convened \u201cThe Menopause Talk,\u201d a panel discussion featuring Barrymore and journalist/activist Maria Shriver, along with physicians. The group, including Winfrey herself, shared personal experiences that once would have been too personal for public discourse.\n\u201cThis is a sea change,\u201d Shriver said on the panel. \u201cI have no idea what my mother\u2019s health journey was. Nobody talked about these things at all.\u201d"

As of 2022, there were 752 K-pop trainees under entertainment labels, according to a Korea Creative Content Agency report.\nDespite recent pushback against the perennial \u201cdark side of K-pop\u201d narrative, the documentary shows that some industry problems persist.\nFormer Blackswan member Youngheun said members had a curfew and were not allowed to drink or date. \u201cWe even had to report when we were getting our nails done and going to the convenience store in front of our house,\u201d she shared in the documentary.\nRigid control extends to diet.\nBlackswan member Gabi is seen eating a meal of egg, chicken breast and what resembles sweet potato sticks during her trainee period. \u201cI am dieting because Mr. Yoon (the label\u2019s head) told me I need to lose weight,\u201d Gabi said.\nThe pressure applies to boy bands, too.\nCravity member Wonjin shared that he was given two weeks to lose weight to join the label. \u201cI would eat like one egg a day (...) I lost about 7kg,\u201d he said in the documentary.\nBradley Cramp, one of executive producers of the documentary, noted that such restrictions exist in other competitive industries as well.\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know one idol or elite sports athlete or entertainer that doesn\u2019t deal with the issue of diet and self-image and mental health to some degree or another,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\nThe documentary also touches on K-pop\u2019s new challenge: embracing diversity.\nFollowing BTS\u2019 international success, K-pop labels have been actively recruiting foreign talents, which sometimes brings unfamiliar challenges.\nIn the documentary, Yoon Deung Ryong, the founder of Blackswan\u2019s label DR Music, struggles to settle internal conflicts among members, which later escalated to online clashes between fans.\n\u201cIf the company says, \u2018don\u2019t fight,\u2019 they won\u2019t fight,\u201d he said, referring to traditional K-pop groups. He added that he can\u2019t control a \u201cmultinational group\u201d the same way because of language and cultural differences. There are currently no Korean members in Blackswan after member changes.\nWith K-pop\u2019s global expansion, fundamental questions about the essence of K-pop remain.\n\u201cIn a K-pop group, if there are no Korean members, I feel like it\u2019s just a K-pop cover group, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Blackswan\u2019s former Korean member Youngheun said in the documentary.\nHowever, Cravity\u2019s Hyeongjun disagrees. \u201cIf foreigners come to Korea and sing in other languages, I am not sure if I can call that K-pop, but since they (Blackswan members) are active in Korea and use Korean, they are K-pop.\u201d\nCramp said social media has impacted K-pop\u2019s ecosystem in various ways, including creating a \u201csymbiotic relationship\u201d between K-pop stars and fans, and forcing stars to live their lives \u201cunder a microscope.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a desire to be real. But on the other hand, you have to obviously keep certain things kind of out of the public spotlight,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cYou want to be famous, but yet at the same time, you still want your privacy and you want to be able to go and have dinner with your friends and have a good time and not be filmed doing it.\u201d\n\u201cK-Pop Idols\u201d is now available on Apple TV+."
