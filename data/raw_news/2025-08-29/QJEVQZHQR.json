  "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Thursday closed up by +0.32%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed up by +0.16%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed up by +0.58%. September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) rose +0.32%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) rose +0.56%. Stock indexes rallied on Thursday, with the S&P 500 posting a new all-time high and the Nasdaq 100 posting a 1.5-week high. Signs that the US economy is holding up pushed stock prices higher on Thursday after Q2 GDP was revised higher than expected, showing the economy expanded more than initially estimated. Also, US weekly initial unemployment claims fell as expected, easing concerns about the labor market. Strength in software stocks and chip makers led the overall market higher on Thursday.\n\u2022 After a 222% Surge, Is SoFi Stock Headed Even Higher?\n\u2022 Stop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief \u2013 your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now! Limiting gains in stocks on Thursday was some disappointing earnings news. Hormel Foods fell more than -13% after reporting weaker-than-expected Q3 adjusted EPS and forecasting Q4 adjusted EPS below consensus. Additionally, there's some weakness in AI stocks following Nvidia's sales forecast, which fell short of lofty expectations. Nvidia fell -0.79% after reporting weaker-than-expected Q2 data center revenue and giving a revenue forecast that was seen as underwhelming. US Q2 GDP was revised upward to +3.3% (q/q annualized) from the previously reported +3.0%, stronger than expectations of +3.1%. US weekly initial unemployment claims fell -5,000 to 229,000, close to expectations of 230,000. US Jul pending home sales fell -0.4% m/m, weaker than expectations of -0.2% m/m. Regarding tariffs, President Trump late Monday threatened to impose new tariffs and export restrictions on advanced technology and semiconductors in retaliation against other nations' digital services taxes that hit American companies. Last week, Mr. Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect last Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit. In other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump on August 13 extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\n\nThe markets this week are focusing on any fresh tariff news or developments on ending the Ukraine-Russian war. On Friday, July personal spending is expected to climb +0.3% m/m, and July personal income is expected to rise +0.4% m/m. Also, the July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is expected to climb +0.2% m/m and +2.9% y/y. In addition, the Aug MNI Chicago PMI is expected to fall -0.6 to 46.5. Finally, the University of Michigan's final-Aug US consumer sentiment index is expected to be unrevised at 58.6. Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 86% at the next FOMC meeting on September 16-17. The markets are discounting the chances at 53% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29. Earnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With Q2 earnings season winding down, over 95% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates. Overseas stock markets on Thursday settled higher. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up +0.07%. China's Shanghai Composite closed up +1.14%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.73%. September 10-year T-notes (ZNU5) on Thursday closed up +4 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield fell -2.3 bp to 4.209%. Sep T-notes climbed to a 4-month nearest-futures high on Thursday, and the 10-year T-note yield fell to a 2-week low of 4.201%. T-notes moved higher on Thursday, benefiting from positive carryover from Wednesday, when New York Fed President Williams stated that at some point, it will be appropriate for the Fed to move rates down, as it is still in a \"modestly restrictive\" stance on policy. Gains in T-notes are limited after the US Q2 GDP was revised higher than expected and after weekly jobless claims declined as expected, which are hawkish factors for Fed policy. Also, weak demand for the Treasury's $44 billion auction of 7-year T-notes was bearish for T-note prices as the auction had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.49, weaker than the 10-auction average of 2.66. European government bond yields on Thursday moved lower. The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 2-week low of 2.679% and finished down -0.5 bp to 2.695%. 10-year UK gilt yield fell -3.6 bp to 4.699%. The Eurozone's August economic confidence indicator unexpectedly fell -0.5 to 95.2, weaker than expectations of an increase to 96.0. Eurozone July new car registrations rose 7.4% year-over-year to 914,680, the biggest increase in 15 months. The summary of the July 23-24 ECB meeting showed that policymakers deemed the risks to inflation to be \"broadly balanced\" and that the Eurozone economy has so far remained resilient to headwinds ranging from tariffs to wars. Swaps are discounting the chances at 3% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting. Chipmakers rallied on Thursday to provide support to the broader market. Marvell Technology (MRVL) closed up more than +4%, and Micron Technology (MU) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed up more than +3%. Also, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Applied Materials (AMAT), and NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI) closed up more than +1%. Snowflake (SNOW) closed up more than +18% to lead software stocks higher after reporting Q2 product revenue of $1.09 billion, better than the consensus of $1.04 billion, and raising its 2026 product revenue forecast to $4.40 billion from a previous estimate of $4.33 billion, stronger than the consensus of $4.34 billion. Also, Datadog (DDOG) closed up more than +6% to lead gainers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, and MongoDB (MDB) closed up more than +7%. In addition, Cloudflare (NET) closed up more than +3% and Atlassian (TEAM) closed up more than +2%. Finally, Salesforce (CRM) closed up more than +1% to lead the gainers in the Dow Jones Industrials.

HP Inc. (HPQ) closed up more than +4% after reporting Q3 net revenue of $13.93 billion, better than the consensus of $13.74 billion. Burlington Stores (BURL) closed up more than +4% after reporting Q2 adjusted EPS of $1.59, well above the consensus of $1.27, and raising its full-year adjusted EPS forecast to $9.19-$9.59 from a previous forecast of $8.70-$9.30, the midpoint above the consensus of $9.26. Five Below (FIVE) closed up more than +3% after reporting Q2 comparable sales rose +12.4%, stronger than the consensus of +9.14%, and raising its full-year net sales forecast to $4.44 billion-$4.52 billion from a previous forecast of $4.33 billion-$4.42 billion. Hormel Foods (HRL) closed down more than -13% to lead losers in the S&P 500 after reporting Q3 adjusted EPS of 35 cents, below the consensus of 40 cents, and forecasting Q4 adjusted EPS of 38 cents-40 cents, weaker than the consensus of 49 cents.

  "argos_summary": "U.S. equity indices rallied on Thursday, with the S&P\u202f500 and Nasdaq posting new highs as a revised Q2 GDP (+3.3% q/q) and falling initial jobless claims bolstered sentiment, while software and chip stocks led the gains.  Corporate earnings were mixed, with Nvidia and Hormel Foods underperforming, but the broader market was supported by strong earnings from firms like Snowflake, Datadog, and Pure Storage.  Treasury yields eased modestly to 4.209% on the 10\u2011year, and European bonds fell to multi\u2011week lows amid a cautious ECB outlook that sees inflation risks broadly balanced.  Tariff tensions\u2014particularly Trump\u2019s threats on semiconductors\u2014remained a backdrop, and Fed futures discount the likelihood of rate cuts in the next two meetings.",
