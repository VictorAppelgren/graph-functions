  "title": "Past the tipping point: why the climate transition is now in our hands",
  "description": "The climate transition is already underway \u2014 but scaling up investment in climate tech, energy communities, and EV innovation is critical.",
  "content": "Jacqueline van den Ende, CEO of Carbon Equity, believes we have already passed the climate transition tipping point: \u201cLast year, 90% of all new electricity production worldwide came from renewable sources, i.e. generated via solar, wind, or water. Meanwhile, China is actually ahead of its climate goals compared to other countries,\u201d she said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a sign to let up; if anything, van den Ende believes we need more investment into climate tech solutions that will help accelerate the transition and make clean energy accessible across the globe. Yet, European climate tech funding sunk to a five-year low in Q1 2025.\n\nIn the latest episode of Kia\u2019s Next Big Drive, van den Ende shares how Carbon Equity is using its platform to democratise climate finance by making it possible for individuals to invest in pioneering climate tech companies.\n\nDespite recent headlines, support for the energy transition is growing across the continent. European citizens are not only voicing their opinions but taking action by reducing and recycling waste (64%) and cutting down on consumption of disposable items whenever possible (49%).\n\nMany are also putting their money where their mouth is. The first half of 2025 marked a significant milestone for the European battery electric vehicle (BEV) market, with new registrations up 34% compared to the same period in 2024.\n\nAccording to the European Commission\u2019s 2025 Eurobarometer survey:\n\nAppetite for creating what the EU calls \u2018energy communities\u2019 has increased over the last few years, as EU funding has supported new community led actions. By securing ownership of renewable energy production, these communities are able to protect residents from price shocks by providing stable, affordable power year-round.\n\nInvestment into an energy network based on wind turbines, an electric boiler, and heat pumps paid off for Denmark\u2019s Hvide Sande District during the 2022 energy crisis. While energy bills soared across Europe, residents of the community saw heating costs drop by over 50%.\n\nSince 2015, Ireland\u2019s Ecovision community has used energy saving profits to create a community fund aimed at helping residents access funding for energy saving renovations. Over 900 homes and 50 community and commercial buildings have been renovated so far, saving over 10 GWh of energy, the equivalent of the average annual electricity consumption of more than 2,300 Irish households. All renovations are done through local contractors, helping to boost the local economy.\n\nRecently, a Finnish town of 5,000 people introduced a sand battery that uses dirt to store excess renewable energy as heat. On a sunny or windy day, the battery heats up, storing energy for weeks or even months. Polar Night, the startup behind the battery, estimates the battery will be able to heat the whole town for a week in winter or an entire month in summer, on just one charge.\n\nThis pilot project could kick start a new trend for communities looking to heat their homes and businesses sustainably.\n\nHowever, the Iberia-wide blackout on April 28th fueled skepticism, with some blaming Spain and Portugal\u2019s net zero ambitions. Just before the blackout, on April 16th, Spain had reached a milestone by running 100% on wind, solar, and hydro power for the first time.\n\nOur sustainability tech reporter, Si\u00f4n Geschwindt, based in Portugal, was quick to report on the story at the time, interviewing several climate tech experts who attributed the Iberian blackout points to grid growing pains \u2014 not green energy failure.\n\n\u201cWhile wind and solar generate clean, cheap electricity, they don\u2019t produce power in a steady stream \u2014 they rise and fall with the weather. However, grids in Europe were largely built for more predictable sources of energy, like coal, gas, or nuclear plants,\u201d says Geschwindt. \u201cWithout that stabilising force, or the addition of alternatives like battery storage systems, the grid becomes more vulnerable to surges in electricity demand or supply.\u201d\n\nExperts, including Carbon Equity portfolio company Octopus Energy, say updating the grid to enable more flexibility is an essential step for the transition. South Australia experienced a similar blackout in 2016. Afterwards, it strengthened its grid by introducing:\n\nBy 2023, South Australia achieved 64% renewable electricity with zero major outages.\n\nWhile helping to significantly lower CO2 emissions, the rise of EVs could also put pressure on the demand for green energy. But carmakers are preparing for a future in which your car will become more than a way of getting from A to B: it could also play an integral role in the energy ecosystem of the future.\n\nThe interview between van den Ende and TNW founder Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten took place in Kia\u2019s all-electric EV9, the first model equipped with vehicle-to-grid technology and bidirectional charging, allowing it to store energy gained from renewable sources and feed it back into the power grid. In fact, a fully charged EV9 with a 99.8kWh battery could power a household for about one week.\n\nIn a recent study, researchers explored the benefits of using an EV to optimise solar energy sharing between neighbours. They found that this arrangement could cut electricity costs for both households by about 1.2 cents per kilowatt-hour for the solar-owning home and 3.6 cents for the neighbor.\n\nA Fraunhofer study for T&E investigated the potential economic benefits of \u2018vehicles to grid\u2019 technology for the wider EU with some promising findings:\n\u2022 By 2040, widespread adoption of bidirectional charging could reduce annual energy system costs across the EU by 8.6%, amounting to \u20ac22.2 billion in savings per year. Even by 2030, savings of 5.5% or \u20ac9.7 billion annually are projected. Total savings between 2030 and 2040 could amount to \u20ac175.45 billion \u2013 which is almost the entire EU budget for 2023.\n\u2022 EVs could contribute up to 9% of Europe\u2019s annual power supply, becoming the 4th largest power supplier. During peak demand periods, EVs could supply 15-20% of instantaneous electricity demand, acting as a mass distribution virtual power plant.\n\u2022 Bidirectional charging could enable an additional 430 GW of solar PV capacity by 2040, nearly doubling the current EU capacity.\n\u2022 The need for stationary battery storage could be cut by up to 92% in 2040, while backup power plant capacity could be reduced by 126 GW.\n\nPotential savings in grid expansion costs could reach \u20ac9.8 billion by 2040, but the researchers warn that this technology should not be seen as a substitute for necessary grid reinforcement and expansion.\n\nHowever, infrastructure requirements, standardization of the technology, and regulatory frameworks governing safety and fair pricing in energy trading between EV owners and utility companies are a few roadblocks that need to be worked out before we can realise the full potential of EVs.\n\nFor now, it seems the use of EVs as \u2018batteries on wheels\u2019 will be very much a community-led experiment, the learnings of which can be used to later scale up this potential. For example, studies into offsetting lost energy during working hours and developing heterogeneous energy sharing across multiple communities are all steps in a more energy efficient direction.\n\nScaling up energy community-led initiatives and experiments could be key to helping the EU move past the energy transition tipping point towards rapid adoption.",

      "text": "Europe\u2019s climate tech startups raised $2.3bn (\u20ac2bn) in the first quarter of this year \u2014 the lowest total since Q3 2020, according to Dealroom data.\nBehind the headline figure lies a complex mix of growing pains, shifting investor focuses, and broader VC market dynamics, experts told TNW.\nMore specifically, they said the slowdown stems from a blend of market maturity, strategic repositioning, AI\u2019s outsized pull on capital, and a tough exit environment.\n\u201cIf we use the narrative of Dunning-Kruger Curve, we are at a slope of despair in climate now, at least for investors,\u201d Rokas Peciulaitis, founder and managing partner at Lithuania-based Contrarian Ventures, told TNW.\n\u201cNo quick wins, no massive exits, mergers and acquisitions are limited,\u201d he added. \u201cMost companies required more capital than assumed, and did not show enough traction. Also, the regulatory tailwind completely failed in most cases.\u201d\nHowever, Peciulaitis believes there is light at the end of the tunnel. \u201cI think those who are disciplined will prevail and win, both on the founder and VC side,\u201d he said.\nThe funding dip comes off the back of an exceptional run. European climate tech funding has soared over the past decade. The sector\u2019s best year was in 2023, when climate tech startups raised $15bn in venture capital \u2014 more than their counterparts in the US. That\u2019s despite an overall poor funding environment that year.\nOrla Browne, head of insights at Dealroom, told TNW that there are several possible reasons why Europe\u2019s climate tech funding has slowed down so far in 2025.\nFirstly, the market is maturing. Some forms of cleantech that previously attracted heaps of VC cash \u2014 like electric mobility startups \u2014 have gone mainstream. As these markets become more established and growth stabilises, they tend to attract less early-stage venture funding, Browne said.\nInvestor hype around AI could also be fuelling the slowdown. \u201cAI is taking the oxygen out of VC, at least for other sectors,\u201d Browne said. \u201cMore than 25% of all VC now goes to AI startups, up from single-digit percentages just a few years ago.\u201d\nAnother reason for the slump could be that climate tech startups are rebranding themselves as a \u201cresilience\u201d or \u201csecurity\u201d play to capitalise on skyrocketing defence tech spending and Europe\u2019s current push for tech sovereignty.\nThe dip likely also signals a broader return to normal, following an unprecedented spike in VC investment in 2021. But Peciulaitis believes there could be a lot of \u201cunannounced deals\u201d in the pipeline this year.\nStartup funding is one of the key themes at TNW Conference, which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

      "text": "Spain and Portugal have largely restored power after Monday\u2019s unprecedented blackout \u2014 the worst in recent European history.\nThe fallout has put the region\u2019s reliance on renewables under fire. Santiago Abascal, leader of Spain\u2019s far-right Vox party, even called on the country to abandon \u201cclimate fanaticism\u201d in response to the power cut. Yet, experts stressed to TNW that the problem isn\u2019t green energy, but the outdated grid infrastructure and technology it relies upon.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened this week should serve as a stark reminder of the dangers of failing to invest in a more resilient energy grid,\u201d Amsterdam-based Taco Engelaar, managing director at energy infrastructure firm Neara, told TNW.\nLast year, Portugal and Spain sourced, respectively, 87.5% and 56% of their electricity from renewables such as wind, solar, and hydropower. The two countries have both, for short periods, run their grids entirely on green energy. However, as the Iberian nations have surged ahead in the race to adopt renewables, they may have become victims of their own momentum.\nOutgrowing the grid?\nWhile wind and solar generate clean, cheap electricity, they don\u2019t produce power in a steady stream \u2014 they rise and fall with the weather. However, grids in Europe were largely built for more predictable sources of energy like coal, gas, or nuclear plants.\nWithout that stabilising force, or the addition of alternatives like battery storage systems, the grid becomes more vulnerable to surges in electricity demand or supply. As we\u2019ve seen this week, on rare occasions, that can overwhelm the system, causing it to crash, taking homes, businesses, and critical services offline.\n\u201cThe first thing to clarify is that this is not a net-zero issue,\u201d Chris Glover, utilities and energy director at British engineering consultancy Buro Happold, told TNW. \u201cThe issue here is managing supply and demand.\u201d\nThe growing mismatch between the grid\u2019s design and its new energy mix is now playing out. But that\u2019s no reason to hit the brakes on the energy transition, said Glover. Instead, he suggests they double down on energy storage, grid balancing tech, and infrastructure upgrades to support a more resilient system.\n\u2018Starved of flexibility\u2019\nSpain and Portugal are not the first to face this challenge. A major blackout in 2016 left 850,000 South Australians without power. Critics, including Australia\u2019s prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, pointed to the state\u2019s ambitious shift to renewables. But rather than retreat, South Australia leaned in, investing in big batteries, so-called synchronous compressors (which mimic the stabilising \u201cinertia\u201d of fossil fuel-powered turbines), and even more wind and solar. Last year, the state sourced 75% of its electricity from renewables and hasn\u2019t had another blackout since. The IEA has called its progress \u201cremarkable.\u201d\nAlex Schoch, head of flexibility at Octopus Energy, believes Spain could take a cue from South Australia\u2019s success. While the latter\u2019s blackout was caused by a storm, \u201cboth countries\u2019 grids lacked the proper tools to recover from sudden shocks,\u201d he wrote on LinkedIn. He called Spain\u2019s power system one \u201cstarved of flexibility.\u201d\nBefore the blackout, Spain\u2019s grid was running on nearly 80% wind and solar \u2014 a huge achievement for clean energy, but also a challenge for stability. There was very little electricity coming from steady sources like gas or nuclear, which help keep the grid balanced. On top of that, Spain has almost no large-scale battery storage to step in when solar or wind drops unexpectedly.\nExperts believe these factors played a key role in Monday\u2019s sweeping blackout. The disruption has been traced back to two separate grid disconnections in the southwest of the country \u2014 the heart of Spain\u2019s solar energy production. With so little backup power in place, the system may have struggled to respond to these disruptions fast enough, leading to cascading failures across the network.\nWhen part of Spain\u2019s power supply suddenly dropped, the grid should have quickly reduced demand to keep everything in balance \u2014 for example, by using batteries or other backup systems to smooth things out, Glover explained. \u201cNo such steps appear to have been taken,\u201d he said.\nWhen power generation drops, countries can often import electricity from neighbours. However, Spain and Portugal are mostly cut off, with just a weak link to France through the Pyrenees mountains. That makes them more vulnerable during outages.\nAlthough the exact cause of the blackout is still under investigation, the disruption \u2014 which saw Spain\u2019s grid lose 15GW of energy in just five seconds \u2014 has raised serious doubts about the region\u2019s energy infrastructure. It could also serve as a stark warning for other countries.\nElectrification conundrum\nAs more electric vehicles plug in, heat pumps replace gas boilers, and factories switch to electric power, Europe\u2019s ageing grids are increasingly feeling the strain. Between 2020 and 2050, electricity demand is set to jump 80%. Yet much of the infrastructure carrying that load was built decades ago. To meet climate targets, annual global grid investment needs to nearly double to $600bn by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nEngelaar believes new technologies could help. \u201cDigital modelling can give [energy] utilities granular insights into every inch of their networks, as well as allowing them to stress-test their assets against potential threats and pinpoint vulnerabilities before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Another software solution is demand response, which automatically adjusts electricity use in real time.\nJacob Bro, partner at climate tech VC firm 2150, also highlights the power of decentralised energy solutions. These include rooftop panels, home batteries, and local wind farms, which generate electricity closer to where it\u2019s used.\n\u201cCloser to our homes and offices, at the edge of the grid, we need to deploy flexible capacity, and we need smarter grids and greater transparency,\u201d he told TNW.\nOverall, what emerges is a complex picture of rapid progress outpacing preparation. The blackout wasn\u2019t a failure of renewables \u2014 it was a failure to keep up with them. If Europe wants a cleaner future, its grids need to catch up fast.\n\u201cInvesting in net-zero infrastructure is a core part of the solution, not the problem,\u201d said Glover.\nGet the TNW newsletter\nGet the most important tech news in your inbox each week."

      "text": "A Fraunhofer study for T&E outlines the potential economic benefits of 'vehicles to grid' technology.\nAs Europe transitions to clean energy and zero-emission transport, electric vehicles (EVs) are emerging as 'batteries on wheels' with the potential to revolutionise our energy system. A new study by the research institutes Fraunhofer ISI and ISE reveals how bidirectional charging could transform EVs into 'virtual power plants', delivering substantial economic benefits.\nKey findings:\nMassive energy system savings: By 2040, widespread adoption of bidirectional charging could reduce annual energy system costs across the EU, by 8.6%, amounting to \u20ac22.2 billion in savings per year. Even by 2030, savings of 5.5% or \u20ac9.7 billion annually are projected. Total savings between 2030 and 2040 could amount to \u20ac175.45 billion - which is almost the entire EU budget for 2023. Those saving stem from a reduction of generation capacity, reduction of curtailment as well as reduced fuel consumption.\nEVs as a major power resource by 2040: EVs could contribute up to 9% of Europe's annual power supply, becoming the 4th largest power supplier. During peak demand periods, EVs could supply 15-20% of instantaneous electricity demand, acting as a massive, distributed virtual power plant.\nBoosting renewable energy integration: bidirectional charging could enable an additional 430 GW of solar PV capacity by 2040, nearly doubling the current EU capacity.\nReduced storage needs: the need for stationary battery storage could be cut by up 92% in 2040, while backup power plant capacity could be reduced by 126 GW.\nEV drivers could save between 4-52% on annual electricity bills, with savings ranging from \u20ac31 to \u20ac780 per year, depending on factors such as location, solar PV ownership, and vehicle battery size - this does not even include V2G services.\nGrid impact: while bidirectional charging offers positive effects on the low voltage grid, the impact is modest. Potential savings in grid expansion costs could reach \u20ac9.8 billion by 2040, but this technology should not be seen as a substitute for necessary grid reinforcement and expansion.\nBattery life considerations contrary to common concerns, bidirectional charging can extend EV battery lifetime by up to 9% compared to standard charging practices.\nHowever, while the benefits are huge the potential is not fully captured today. Not all electric vehicles are V2X capable. Crucially, there are important interoperability challenges as current focus on either AC or DC bidirectional charging by different manufacturers poses a significant barrier to widespread adoption. Ensuring interoperability between all EVs and chargers - by mandating bidirectional capability as a standard at EU level - is crucial for realizing the full potential of bidirectional charging technology.\nBy leveraging the full potential of electric vehicles as 'batteries on wheels', Europe can significantly reduce energy system costs, enhance grid stability, and accelerate the transition to renewable energy. This approach aligns perfectly with the EU's climate and energy goals, offering a win-win solution for consumers, the energy sector, and the environment.\nTo find out more, download the briefing and study.\nEU cave in on vehicle trade rules\nPedestrians, cyclists and drivers are at increased risk as the rapid rise in monster US pick-up trucks on Europe\u2019s roads is set to accelerate after th...\nEU budget falls short at boosting competitiveness\nT&E reaction to the post-2027 EU budget proposal\nAfter the battery is depleted, EREVs consume an average of 6.4 litres per 100 km \u2013 no better than a conventional petrol SUV, new analysis finds."

      "text": "Tre vindm\u00f8ller giver Hvide Sande uh\u00f8rt billig fjernvarme\nEl fra vindm\u00f8ller og et produktionssystem med en elkedel og varmepumpe til at udnytte det, har i \u00e5r givet Hvide Sande Fjernvarme en varmepris p\u00e5 4.273 kroner. Midt i en energikrise har den gr\u00f8nne investering for alvor givet pote i havnebyen, og derfor er vindm\u00f8llerne ogs\u00e5 blevet en del af den lokale identitet.\nDet bliver sv\u00e6rt at sl\u00e5 Hvide Sande Fjernvarme, hvis man har ambitioner om at bejle til titlen som \u201dDanmarks billigste fjernvarme\u201d anno 2022.\nI s\u00e5 fald skal man toppe en pris p\u00e5 s\u00f8lle 4.273 kroner for et standardhus.\nAllerede tilbage i maj kunne Hvide Sande Fjernvarme nemlig melde ud, at man sl\u00f8jfede \u00e5rets sidste to rater og s\u00e6nkede den forventede \u00e5rlige fjernvarmepris med mere end 50 procent \u2013 fra 9.903 kroner til de f\u00f8r omtalte 4.273 kroner.\nForklaringen p\u00e5 det skal findes i tre af landets mest effektive vindm\u00f8ller, som har en optimal placering ved den lokale havn, lige ud mod Vesterhavet. De tilh\u00f8rer Hvide Sande Fjernvarme og er ledningsforbundet direkte med fjernvarmev\u00e6rket. M\u00f8llerne producerer ofte mere el, end fjernvarmeselskabet selv kan n\u00e5 at bruge p\u00e5 deres elkedel og varmepumpe - resten s\u00e6lger de derfor ud p\u00e5 elnettet.\nOg det er en exceptionelt god forretning for tiden, hvor elpriserne er skyh\u00f8je og svinger omtrent lige s\u00e5 meget som rotorbladene p\u00e5 Hvide Sandes vindm\u00f8ller p\u00e5 en bl\u00e6sende dag.\nMidt i en energikrise giver det mange fordele \u2013 men driftsleder Morten Rauhe fremh\u00e6ver s\u00e6rligt \u00e9n: Det har gjort Hvide Sande Fjernvarme selvfinansierende.\n- I og med at vi ikke skal k\u00f8be en masse gas, som er steget markant, kan vi levere fjernvarmen til en fast pris. Og de \u00f8gede elpriser er med til at h\u00f8jne prisen p\u00e5 den str\u00f8m, vi s\u00e6lger. Vi har desuden en akkumuleringstank, som vi bruger som buffer, n\u00e5r str\u00f8mmen er dyr, siger han og forts\u00e6tter:\n- Det kr\u00e6ver selvf\u00f8lgelig, at vi t\u00e6nker smart, n\u00e5r vi regulerer ud p\u00e5 elnettet. Til det har vi en softwarel\u00f8sning fra EMD, som hj\u00e6lper os med at forudsige, hvordan vi k\u00f8rer produktionen og handler med el.\nI og med at vi ikke skal k\u00f8be en masse gas, som er steget markant, kan vi levere fjernvarmen til en fast pris. Og de \u00f8gede elpriser er med til at h\u00f8jne prisen p\u00e5 den str\u00f8m, vi s\u00e6lger. Vi har desuden en akkumuleringstank, som vi bruger som buffer, n\u00e5r str\u00f8mmen er dyr.\nRobust, gr\u00f8n varmeproduktion\nFor nylig kunne Hvide Sande Fjernvarme melde ud, at varmeprisen i 2023 forbliver p\u00e5 et uh\u00f8rt lavt niveau \u2013 nemlig 5.241 kroner.\nFjernvarmeselskabets budget f\u00f8lger nemlig prognoserne for elprisen \u2013 og forventningen er, at den vil forblive h\u00f8j til n\u00e6ste \u00e5r. Morten Rauhe understreger dog, at man i Hvide Sande har en fornuftig varmeproduktion, krise eller ej. Arbejdet med den gr\u00f8nne omstilling g\u00e5r nemlig helt tilbage til 2011 \u2013 og i 2020 modtog man Fjernvarmeprisen for de gr\u00f8nne tiltag.\n- Vores bestyrelse og den tidligere driftsleder har investeret i gr\u00f8n fjernvarme med solvarme, tre vindm\u00f8ller og en elkedel. Det supplerede vi s\u00e5 i oktober 2020 med en 4,6 MW varmepumpe. I dag er mellem 85 og 90 procent af varmen gr\u00f8n \u2013 og naturgassen bruger vi kun til spidslast, fort\u00e6ller han.\nElkedlen kom til i 2011, mens solvarmen blev koblet p\u00e5 fjernvarmenettet i 2014 og i dag bidrager med over 10% af varmeproduktionen. Men det er og bliver de tre vindm\u00f8ller, som lige nu g\u00f8r den helt store forskel for varmeprisen i Hvide Sande.\nDe indledende overvejelser om at investere i vindm\u00f8llerne kom i 2016, hvor de i perioder stod stille, fordi elprisen var s\u00e5 lav, at det ikke kunne betale sig for de dav\u00e6rende ejere at have dem k\u00f8rende.\nVind var p\u00e5 det tidspunkt ikke en god forretning \u2013 men i dag er Morten Rauhe i hvert fald ikke i tvivl om, at fjernvarmeselskabet lavede en god investering p\u00e5 det helt rette tidspunkt.\n- Man t\u00e6nkte i Hvide Sande Fjernvarme, at det var latterligt at br\u00e6nde gas af, mens de lokale vindm\u00f8ller stod stille. Hvorfor lukke CO2 ud i atmosf\u00e6ren, n\u00e5r man lige s\u00e5 godt lave gr\u00f8n energi ved at kombinere vindm\u00f8llerne med en elkedel? Derfor valgte man at k\u00f8be dem over tid \u2013 de to f\u00f8rste i 2018 og den sidste i 2019, fort\u00e6ller driftslederen.\nEt lokalt vartegn\nDet med vindm\u00f8ller i baghaven er ofte genstand for lokale kontroverser og utilfredse naboer. Men i Hvide Sande er lige det modsatte faktisk tilf\u00e6ldet. Her er de tre vindm\u00f8ller sammen med marhalmen i baggrunden blevet et vartegn, som er med p\u00e5 postkort fra byen. Og de indg\u00e5r ogs\u00e5 i Hvide Sande Fjernvarmes logo.\nDen store opbakning til vindm\u00f8llerne, tilskriver Morten Rauhe det sammenhold, man har i byen. Og han kan kun give cadeau for, at Hvide Sande har taget dem til sig p\u00e5 den m\u00e5de.\n- Alle i byen f\u00e5r gavn af vindm\u00f8llerne, og jeg vil n\u00e6sten ogs\u00e5 vove at p\u00e5st\u00e5, at alle forbrugerne kan se dem fra et eller andet hj\u00f8rne af deres grund, siger han og forts\u00e6tter:\n- Den helt store fort\u00e6lling da de blev bygget var, at de skulle finansiere en havneudvidelse. Og havnen er jo hjertet i Hvide Sande. Derfor st\u00e5r m\u00f8llerne p\u00e5 en lejet grund, som tilh\u00f8rer havnen. Jo flere penge, m\u00f8llerne genererer, jo st\u00f8rre bliver havnelejen. S\u00e5 vi giver til alle, n\u00e5r vi producerer el p\u00e5 dem - b\u00e5de forbrugerne og havnen. Det har en enorm betydning for byen, og s\u00e5 bliver vindm\u00f8ller jo pludselig flotte at se p\u00e5, siger han.\nDet forventes, at der alene i 2022 vil blive betalt et arealleje til havnen for vindm\u00f8llerne p\u00e5 et sted mellem ni og ti millioner kroner.\nAlle i byen f\u00e5r gavn af vindm\u00f8llerne, og jeg vil n\u00e6sten ogs\u00e5 vove at p\u00e5st\u00e5, at alle forbrugerne kan se dem fra et eller andet hj\u00f8rne af deres grund.\nFremtiden er gr\u00f8nnere \u2013 men byder nok ikke p\u00e5 flere vindm\u00f8ller\nSelvom vindm\u00f8ller ikke m\u00f8der samme modstand i Hvide Sandes baghaver som s\u00e5 mange andre steder, er der ikke udsigt til flere m\u00f8ller i havnebyen, siger Morten Rauhe.\nDe tre, man allerede har, matcher nemlig varmeproduktionen ret godt. Og med en tilslutningsprocent i Hvide Sande p\u00e5 96 procent, mener driftslederen ikke, at det giver den store mening at s\u00e6tte flere op. Der er nemlig ikke rigtig plads til flere fjernvarmeudvidelse i havnebyen, som ligger forholdsvis isoleret.\n- S\u00e5 hvis vi skal have flere forbrugere, skal vi langt ud. De sidste fire procent, vi mangler i byen, er prim\u00e6rt varmepumper, som folk har investeret i for nylig. Men jeg tror da ikke, at der er tvivl om, at alle \u2013 ogs\u00e5 dem med varmepumper \u2013 gerne vil p\u00e5 fjernvarmen, mener driftslederen.\nHeldigvis er konverteringer ikke den eneste m\u00e5de at t\u00e6nke i gr\u00f8nne ambitioner p\u00e5. N\u00e5r man nu ikke kan udvide forbrugerbasen, kan man nemlig i stedet fors\u00f8ge at g\u00f8re fjernvarmen endnu mere milj\u00f8venlig. Og det er ogs\u00e5 m\u00e5let i Hvide Sande.\n- Det kunne da v\u00e6re sjovt at blive 100 procent gr\u00f8nne og helt fri for naturgas. Men de n\u00e6rmeste fremtidsplaner drejer sig om at f\u00e5 mere akkumulering, s\u00e5 vi kan lagre mere fjernvarmevand, n\u00e5r det for alvor bl\u00e6ser. Derfor har vi planer om at bygge en ny akkumuleringstank, som vi udnytter afh\u00e6ngigt af vejret, siger Morten Rauhe og uddyber:\n- Ogs\u00e5 for at beskytte os selv mod store udsving i energipriserne. Jeg tvivler p\u00e5, at de bliver mindre svingende, efterh\u00e5nden som vi f\u00e5r mere sol- og vindenergi ind i vores energiproduktion."

This event mirrored South Australia's 2016 crisis but highlighted a critical difference: South Australia learned from its mistakes and built resilience through battery storage and demand response. Two Blackouts, One Root Cause Spain 2025: A Grid Starved of Flexibility Spain's grid failure began with a loss of generation, triggering instability. The system couldn\u2019t stabilise quickly enough, causing interconnectors to France to trip and leading to a loss of 15GW of power. Key factors included: Low inertia: 70% of Spain\u2019s power came from renewables, lacking the inertia traditionally provided by fossil fuel plants. No rapid response: Scarce batteries and demand response meant reliance on slower-acting gas plants, hydro, and imports. South Australia 2016: Stormy Weather Meets Outdated Systems South Australia\u2019s blackout was triggered by storm damage, but the real issue was outdated protection settings: Wind farms disconnected due to voltage dips. The interconnector to Victoria overloaded and tripped. Both grids lacked the tools to recover from sudden shocks. How South Australia Fixed Its Grid After 2016, South Australia rebuilt its grid, focusing on flexibility. The Hornsdale Power Reserve (Tesla Big Battery) was key: Batteries stepped up: Hornsdale\u2019s 150 MW battery provided synthetic inertia and fast frequency response (FFR). It responded in 0.14 seconds during an outage, versus minutes for traditional generators. Demand response joined: Aggregated rooftop solar, batteries, and smart thermostats balanced supply and demand. Grid settings modernised: Updated requirements kept wind farms online during disturbances. By 2023, South Australia achieved 64% renewable electricity with zero major outages. #energytransition #smartgrid #flexibility #batterystorage Octopus Energy Greg Jackson Roberto Giner Anna Casas Llopart Mark Twidell Josef Tadich Drew Baglino Marcia Poletti smartEn Smart Energy Europe\nThe Blueprint Spain Needs Now Drawing on South Australia\u2019s playbook, here\u2019s the path forward: 1. Accelerate Battery Deployment Target: 20 GW of grid-scale batteries by 2030 (up from <1GW). Focus: Prioritise projects offering synthetic inertia and frequency management. Funding: Redirect EU recovery funds to storage. Make domestic batteries smart: Allow home batteries to provide grid services. 2. Unlock \"Hidden\" Demand Flexibility Automate demand response: Use smart devices to react in real-time to grid signals. Aggregate everything: Pool EVs, heat pumps, and industrial loads into virtual power plants (VPPs). Open markets: Allow smart devices to provide fast demand response. 3. Modernize Grid Protocols Update protection settings: Ensure solar/wind farms stay online during disturbances. Build interconnectors: Double capacity to France by 2030. Plan for a decentralised smart system: Incentivise renewable generation to actively support the grid. 4. Reward Speed in Energy Markets Pay for milliseconds: Create markets that value synthetic inertia and sub-second response. End fossil fuel favours: Phase out subsidies for gas peakers.\nIt is reasonable to assume that the lack of inertia in the system is not due to lack of knowledge. Assuming the knowledge/ understanding was there - the fact that there was shortage might reflect budgetary limitations or overly optimistic projections. if budget constraints were indeed the culprit: i wonder if the cost of the outage + kicking things back into operation was high enough to trigger proper budget allocation.\nLoss of inertia has likely occurred on the load side too with more inverter based appliances. And, while there has certainly has been a loss of inertia provided by generation I've not seen this quantified... but it seems to be the magnet for blame. Strategies to help stop a cascade could include using different protection and fault response characteristics across the portfolio of generation. This would change the timing of trips.. a very small change to the rate of change in generation online and hence frequency can give protection and dispatch the milliseconds needed to stop a cascade. Note that all large machines (e.g. the nukes) tripped simultaneously. Almost all inverter based generation could apply control strategies to inject reactive power in emergencies, this is done for over voltages using AS4777... but similar could be implemented for under voltages... reducing real power while flex is reducing load.. distributed control is needed!\nI wasn't aware that the root cause in the Spanish / Portuguese outage had been identified yet. Having said that, what you've implied does make sense.\nThanks for the clarity on the Iberian Island chaos this week, as shared by Giles Petersen of Renew Economy. We at #Asynsis suggest #MetaLoop PRT-VPP networks are the multi-modal way forward to build greater renewables-led grid resilience by serving as distributed big batteries and virtual power plants via our personal rapid transit concept. New video here: https://asynsis.medium.com/metaloop-f5caa684d1e9\nSimple and powerful \ud83d\udd0b \ud83e\uddbe\nGreat post Alex - two further thoughts: 1.Across Europe we need to be designing the post-transition electricity systems now (in particular how will we cost effectively run electricity systems with low inertia and limited dispatchable power - answer of course: synthetic inertia from inverter based generation, lots of assets capable of fast frequency response - such as grid scale batteries, and lots of dispatchable demand (including bringing forward V2G quickly) 2. We then need to ask why these things are not happening with current market structures - why the UK has 5-8 GW of Grid Scale BESS already on the system, and at least 1.6GW of demand response participating in capacity market, balancing mechanism, and DSO markets versus the 10MW of BESS in Spain and no demand response (outside SRAD).\nIt\u2019s bizarre how you can write here with such clarity and insight, and in contrast, not keep on top of Sunday plans for a roast dinner.\nLeading the Energy Transition as VP / Group Director, Flexibility & Electrification at Octopus Energy\n4moHow Batteries and Demand Response Could Have Saved Spain Spain\u2019s grid was vulnerable due to: No synthetic inertia: Minimal battery storage to compensate for solar/wind. Slow demand response: A 15+ minute activation time was too slow for a rapid crisis. Islanded grid: Limited interconnectors left Spain isolated. Here\u2019s what could have helped: 1. Grid-Scale Batteries: The Inertia Insurance Policy Batteries provide synthetic inertia and FFR. South Australia's Hornsdale slashed grid stabilization costs and prevented outages. Spain had only <1 GW of batteries vs. 50 GW of solar/wind, missing a rapid-response safety net. 2. Instant Intelligent Demand Response Instant access to resources like smart water heaters, EV chargers, and factory loads could have further stabilised the system. South Australia\u2019s demand response shaved 200+ MW off peak demand. Spain\u2019s 15-minute activation was too slow. 3. Interconnectors + Market Reform Upgraded interconnectors helped South Australia in later storms. Spain\u2019s weak links to France provided no lifeline."

      "text": "Stories\nJuly success story: Home renovations following the seven cooperative principles\nCommunity energy is key to action on the climate crisis. It can empower people, boost local economies, and reinvigorate communities. Community-led initiatives play an important role in the transition towards a 100% renewable and just energy future. Success stories of community energy projects can be found all over Europe. At REScoop.eu we want to highlight these stories to further accelerate the movement towards a cleaner and democratic system.\nThis month, we travel to Ireland on 6 July to celebrate the International Day of Cooperatives with EcoVision, a community-owned cooperative dedicated to citizen-led renovations.\nRenovations in the hands of citizens\nEcoVision, formerly known as Energy Communities Tipperary Cooperative, was established in 2015 by four local communities to carry out energy efficiency projects for old homes and community buildings in County Tipperary, Ireland. Since then, they have upgraded more than 900 houses and 50 community and commercial buildings, saving over 10 GWh of energy, the equivalent of the average annual electricity consumption of more than 2,300 Irish households.\nHome renovations allow inhabitants to save energy, reduce their energy bills, and enhance their comfort. When these renovations are carried out following the seven cooperative principles, they offer additional benefits. As a non-profit organisation, EcoVision provides impartial advice and can offer better prices than profit-driven organisations. With the long-term social transformation of communities in Clare, Limerick and Tipperary as its main objective, EcoVision prioritises local contractors, boosting the local economy and creating employment in the area. Moreover, it supports other community projects in the region.\nEcoVision pioneered citizen-led renovations with a one-stop-shop approach in Ireland. This model, developed organically by EcoVision, provides an integrated solution for home renovation services, simplifying the process for customers and guiding them throughout the entire renovation journey.\nA project based on cooperative principles\nA volunteer board of directors oversaw EcoVision\u2019s activities for many years. However, in 2022, due to the growth in the number of members and activities, the board deemed it necessary to recruit a general manager. M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 M\u00e9al\u00f3id, previously the general manager of the development cooperative of Cape Clear Island, was chosen for the position. M\u00e1irt\u00edn decided to join EcoVision because its ethos aligned with his own: the cooperative principles.\nDespite being registered as a company limited by guarantee \u2013 a legal structure usually used by non-profit companies in Ireland \u2013 EcoVision operates according to the cooperative principles. \u201cIt is a cooperative in principles, structure, and action,\u201d M\u00e1irt\u00edn notes, and emphasises that \u201cthe legal structure isn\u2019t important; what is important is how we function, behave, and treat our members, staff, and other citizens.\u201d\nFor M\u00e1irt\u00edn, the cooperative principles mean \u201cworking together as a collective of equals to improve the lives of the community and build a better and more sustainable society for everyone\u201d.\nToday, the volunteer board of directors steers EcoVision activities, while M\u00e1irt\u00edn handles the daily management, reporting to the board in monthly meetings. In the transformation from Energy Communities Tipperary Cooperative to EcoVision, a number of changes have been made to the cooperative\u2019s statutes to allow for a broader membership. Beginning in autumn 2024, on top of the annual general meeting, there will be three online open member meetings per year to facilitate information exchange. This governance system ensures democratic member control, in line with the second cooperative principle.\nConcern for community\nLike many cooperatives, EcoVision is a non-profit organisation, but M\u00e1irt\u00edn clarifies this concept.\n\u201cProfit is not a bad word. If you are not making a profit, you are making a loss, and then you are finished. You have to make profit, but what\u2019s important in a social enterprise is what you do with that profit. At EcoVision, it goes back into the cooperative development and to our community fund, which helps our community member organisations with energy projects.\u201d\nFor example, in Lorrha, a village within one of the member communities where the last shop closed years ago, EcoVision contributed to the energy aspects of a building renovation to host a new community shop and caf\u00e9. Last month, they also installed solar PV on the roof to supply the shop and caf\u00e9 with solar energy.\nThis perfectly exemplifies the seventh cooperative principle: \u201cCooperatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members.\u201d\nEducation, training and information\nEcoVision also adheres to the fifth cooperative principle regarding education, training and information for staff, members and the general public. One of its main services is helping citizens access renovation grants from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). When working with new contractors, the cooperative offers upskilling in sustainable renovations and organises workshops on the technical requirements of the SEAI funding programmes.\nEcoVision\u2019s Energy Saving Champion Programme focuses on the general public. They train energy saving champions who then guide people in their community on how to best reduce domestic energy consumption and improve energy efficiency.\nReplicating the citizen-led renovation model\nWhen asked for advice to other cooperatives aiming to get involved in citizen-led renovations, M\u00e1irt\u00edn draws on the sixth cooperative principle, which refers to the cooperation among cooperatives.\n\u201cMy advice would be to look at the work of cooperatives. There\u2019s no need to reinvent the wheel. Organisations like EcoVision, People Powered Retrofit in the UK, Energent in Belgium, and Les 7 Vent in France are already doing citizen-led renovations. Together we are trying to advance cooperative One-Stop Shop building renovation services in Europe through the OSR-Coop project. I invite people to follow the project and join our capacity building activities.\u201d\nM\u00e1irt\u00edn also mentions REScoop.eu\u2019s citizen-led renovation working group, where REScoop.eu members collaborate and share knowledge, experience, and best practices on deep and shallow renovations."

      "text": "A small town in Finland is about to ditch fossil fuels in its heating network thanks to a sand-filled energy storage tank the size of a house.\nFinnish startup Polar Night Energy recently turned on the so-called sand battery in the municipality of Pornainen, an hour north of Helsinki.\nThe machine, which uses dirt to store excess renewable energy as heat, will warm the homes and businesses in the town of 5,000 people. It is expected to replace natural gas and oil in Pornainen\u2019s district heating network entirely, slashing emissions by an estimated 70%.\n\u201cThis project is a powerful example that effective solutions for mitigating climate change do exist,\u201d said Liisa Naskali, COO at Polar Night Energy. \u201cCombustion is not a sustainable option for the climate or the environment.\u201d\nThe energy-storing structure measures about 13 metres tall and 15 metres wide and is filled with 2,000 tonnes of crushed soapstone, a byproduct of the construction industry. The new battery is 10 times larger than the startup\u2019s first pilot plant in Pornainen, launched in 2022.\nWhen renewables are abundant, like on a sunny or windy day, clean electricity is wired to the battery. There, it powers a heater that sends hot air through a series of pipes into the giant vat of sand, heating it to a toasty 600\u00b0C.\nThanks to the battery\u2019s insulated wall, this energy can be stored for weeks or even months. When needed, the battery discharges the hot air on demand \u2014 warming water in the district heating network. This can provide heat to households, factories, and even swimming pools.\n\u201cOf course, we alone cannot solve the whole problem of climate change, but we need different solutions, and our sand battery is one of them,\u201d said Naskali in a video.\nWith a power output of 100 MWh, Polar Night estimates the battery will be able to heat the whole town of Pornainen for a week in winter, or an entire month in summer when demand is lower \u2014 on just one charge. The town will still maintain a biomass boiler, which burns wood chips, as a backup source of energy during peak demand.\nCharging the sand battery from ambient temperature to 600\u00b0C takes about four days. However, in practice, it\u2019s continuously topped up with excess renewable energy whenever it\u2019s available \u2014 so it rarely drops back to the temperature of the surrounding air.\nPolar Night said it is currently discussing installing new, bigger sand batteries in Finland and internationally. It aims to offer a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels for heating homes.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), heating accounts for around half of total energy consumption. In Europe, the majority of this heat comes from burning natural gas, oil, wood chips, or waste.\nFor European towns, especially ones with access to lots of renewable energy, sand batteries could be low-hanging fruit. If scaled, they could become a significant part of the energy storage toolbox, alongside other options such as lithium-ion, gravity, hydropower, and CO2 domes.\nWant to discover the next big thing in tech?
