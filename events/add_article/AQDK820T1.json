      "summary": "Tesla reports that more than half of Model S and Model X owners now use Full‑Self Driving (FSD), up from single‑digit rates across the fleet to the teens. The company’s FSD beta, launched in 2020, offers navigation, lane changes and turns but still requires driver supervision and has faced NHTSA scrutiny over accidents. Tesla has adjusted FSD pricing over the years, most recently cutting the subscription from $12,000 to $8,000 in 2024 and offering a $99/month plan. The increased adoption signals growing confidence in the technology, though safety concerns remain.",
