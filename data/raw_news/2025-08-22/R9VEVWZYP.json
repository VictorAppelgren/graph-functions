  "title": "MSP Jeremy Balfour resigns from Conservatives",
  "description": "The Lothian representative claims senior MSPs are being ignored under Russell Findlay's leadership.",
  "content": "A leading Scottish Conservative MSP has quit the party with immediate effect. Jeremy Balfour, who was the Tory spokesperson on social justice, said he would sit as an independent until the Holyrood election in May. In a resignation letter seen by BBC Scotland News, the Lothians MSP raised concerns that the party had \"fallen into the trap of reactionary politics\" under Russell Findlay's leadership. He is the second MSP to leave the party since the Tories lost power at Westminster and Findlay became Scottish leader.\n\n\"I no longer feel that the party has a positive platform to offer the people of Scotland,\" Balfour said. \"Increasingly, decisions seem to be made by advisers who lack experience, while senior MSP colleagues are ignored.\"\n\nFindlay has promised to offer tax and spending cuts at the 2026 Holyrood election, saying he would \"wield a claymore\" on wasteful spending if elected. Balfour said he did not believe the party was interested in tackling welfare reform \"beyond blind slashing of budgets\" which he said \"will put those in most need at highest risk\". The MSP also accused the party of focusing on rural areas \"at the expense of our cities\". He said: \"I fear that the Scottish Conservatives have fallen into the trap of reactionary politics, where a positive, proactive agenda for real change has been rejected in favour of allowing policies to be dictated by what other parties are saying and chasing cheap headlines.\" Balfour said he felt he had \"no choice\" but to cut ties with the party he had \"once proudly represented\", adding: \"But unfortunately it might take some harsh electoral results to force the issue.\"\n\nThe MSP was first elected on the Lothian regional list in 2016. He has had several stints as a Conservative deputy spokesperson, including on equalities, housing and welfare. However, Balfour has remained on the backbenches since Findlay became party leader in September last year. He backed former deputy leader Meghan Gallacher in the leadership contest. Before being elected to Holyrood, Balfour worked as a solicitor and Baptist minister. Born with no left arm and a right arm that ends at the elbow, he has been vocal proponent for disabled rights. Earlier this year he opposed assisted dying legislation, citing concerns for disabled people as well as his Christian faith.\n\nIt comes after West of Scotland MSP Jamie Greene defected from the Tories to the Liberal Democrats. He accused his former party of becoming \"Trump-esque in both style and substance\". The Conservatives have also seen several councillors defect to Reform, with polls suggesting Nigel Farage's party could make an electoral breakthrough at next year's Holyrood election.\n\nRussell Findlay took over as Scottish Conservative leader after a fractious internal contest that left some lasting divisions. Having lost power at Westminster, opinion polls suggest the Tories are under huge pressure ahead of next year's Holyrood election. That was clearly illustrated in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election where they slipped into fourth place behind Reform UK. That challenge from the political right seems to have impacted how Russell Findlay is positioning his party. He has prioritised plans to cut what he considers wasteful public spending and to ease the transition to net zero carbon emissions. What he has not done is take all of his Holyrood colleagues with him and in losing MSPs he risks losing some authority too.",

      "text": "Tories will 'wield claymore' on spending, says Findlay\n- Published\nScottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay has pledged to save \u00a3650m from the Scottish budget if elected at next year's Holyrood election.\nFindlay said he would achieve this by introducing a Taxpayer Saving Act to \"cut red tape and get a grip on spending\" alongside a Scottish Agency of Value and Efficiency (Save) to \"wield a claymore\" on waste.\nFindlay told the party's conference in Edinburgh he would put \"streamlining\" the Scottish government at the heart of his plans if elected next year.\nHe urged voters to back the Scottish Conservatives over Reform UK, adding a vote for Nigel Farage's party would only result in \"another five years of SNP government\".\nIn his keynote speech to members, Findlay accused John Swinney's government of \"wasting untold sums of public money\".\nHe said the party would shut down government quangos, reduce the number of ministers and advisors and cut the size of the civil service to levels last seen 10 years ago in order to \"deliver better value\".\n- Published13 June\nMoney regained from the Taxpayer Saving Act would be used to reduce taxes, he told the conference at Murrayfield Stadium.\nSave, which would be run by business leaders, would be tasked with cutting government \"waste,\" while an Accountability and Transparency Index would be introduced as a way of \"shining a light\" on organisations which receive public funding.\nHe also said a \u00a320,000 pay rise for ministers would be reversed.\nFindlay told party members: \"There will be no more jobs for the SNP boys.\n\"Putting a stop to wasteful spending is top of our agenda.\n\"We need to urgently streamline bloated government.\"\nHe added: \"Improving services means treating people's money with respect.\"\nFindlay also revealed plans to scrap the SNP's 2045 net zero target and replaced the Just Transition Fund with an Affordable Transition Fund aimed at supporting oil and gas workers.\nOn Friday, the UK Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, used her speech at the conference to call for an end to the windfall tax in the North Sea.\nFindlay said residents would be given new powers to oppose \"mega-pylons\" and would end the current presumption against new nuclear energy in Scotland.\nThe Conservative leader claimed pupils in schools were being \"written off\" and that \"woke ideas\" were being pushed on children \"at the expense of vital knowledge\".\n'Reform vote increases SNP chances'\nFindlay said his party offered a \"common sense vision\" for Scotland.\nBut he said those considering abandoning the party in favour of Reform would only help the SNP hang on to power.\nAberdeenshire councillor Lauren Knight became the latest Conservative councillor to defect to Reform on Friday, stating she felt \"let down\" by the party.\nReform also finished ahead of the Conservatives in the recent Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election, which saw the Tory vote fall by 11.5%.\nFindlay described Farage's spending plans as \"fantastical\" and said only his party could \"shake up Scottish politics\".\nHe said: \"Reform pretend they can do it, but all they'll achieve is another five years of SNP government.\n\"As we saw at the General Election, and as every poll shows, Reform increases the chance of the SNP winning.\"\nHe added: \"Maybe it's because Nigel Farage says he's not worried about the SNP getting another five-year term.\n\"Well we are worried about the SNP, Nigel, because we live here.\n\"But we can't spend our time focusing on Reform because it's what we do that matters most.\"\nThe first thing Russell Findlay did in this speech was to acknowledge the scale of the challenge that lies ahead.\nHe said it was a \"mammoth task\" for the Conservatives to win back voter trust after the party had 'lost its way' in power at Westminster.\nHe knows that Reform UK is drawing support away from the Tories in Scotland and accused Nigel Farage of making undeliverable spending promises.\nMuch of his fire was directed at his current Holyrood rivals - the SNP and Labour - who he believes represent a left-leaning consensus.\nHis alternative is a tax-cutting agenda which he believes can be funded from reducing wasteful public spending.\nIn the election campaign to come, expect plenty of political argument over what is wasteful and what is essential in the delivery of Scottish public services."

      "text": "Slater - this bill would give every person 'bodily autonomy'published at 18:04 British Summer Time 13 May\nScottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater says she believes the bill will provide safe and compassionate legislation.\nSlater argues that the decision comes down to giving a person bodily autonomy. She says the decision to end life prematurely should not be a choice against excellent palliative care, and that the latter should be supported.\nShe says the bill differs from the proposal at Westminster, particularly with regards to the life expectancy time limitation in each bill.\nThe Green MSP says that as an autistic person she has concerns regarding how caveats around mental illness could be interpreted, but there are now \u201cdecades of data\u201d available from other countries that could offer guidance and help protect people from coercion.\nBlocking the legislation could lead to \u201cmonths or years of suffering\u201d for some people, she argues."

      "text": "Jamie Greene quits Conservative group at Holyrood\n- Published\nConservative MSP Jamie Greene has resigned from the party's group at Holyrood.\nThe former frontbencher, in a letter to leader Russell Findlay, said he had made the \"difficult\" decision to quit the Tory whip with immediate effect.\nThe West of Scotland MSP accused the party of becoming \"Trump-esque in both style and substance\".\nIn a statement, Findlay said he was disappointed to lose an MSP but vowed his party would stand up for \"common-sense values\".\nGreene, who sits on the left of the party, was one of six Conservative MSPs who ran for the leadership last summer, with Findlay ultimately winning the contest.\nGreen said when he joined the party under the leadership of Ruth Davidson in Scotland and David Cameron at Westminster it supported a \"socially liberal view of the world\".\n\"It was a party that made a young, working class, gay man from Greenock feel very welcome,\" he said. \"I do not regret making that decision.\"\nBut the MSP warned the \"modern\" party he joined \"no longer exists\".\n'Grotesque dance with Farage'\nHe also claimed the Tories were in a \"grotesque dance with Nigel Farage\" in an attempt to win over right-wing voters.\nGreen accused the party of adopting a \"Reform-lite agenda that appeals to the worst of our society, and not the best\".\nHe said: \"Instead of proudly leading on equality, we now run the very serious and immediate risk of becoming once again the party of social division and morality wars.\n\"A cursory glance at our social media output confirms this fear.\n\"My generation of Conservative politician helped put the nasty party name in the bin, but it now appears that it was just filed away in a drawer marked pending.\"\nGreene first ran as a Conservative candidate at the 2015 general election. He won a seat to Holyrood in 2016 and was re-elected on the West Scotland list.\nHe has served as the party's spokesperson on justice, education and transport.\nThe MSP previously said he was sacked from the frontbench in 2023 for supporting Scotland's gender recognition reforms.\nBefore being elected to parliament in 2016, he worked in the media.\nGreene will now sit as an independent, leaving the Conservatives with 30 MSPs.\nSpeaking to reporters at Holyrood, Findlay said his party was focusing on issues that were important to Conservative voters, such as taxation, and \"not the fringe of obsessions of Holyrood\".\nHe denied that the party of Ruth Davidson was \"gone\", highlighting that she supported his leadership bid.\nFindlay said it was \"unfortunate\" that the Tories had lost Greene - as well as several councillors to Reform - since he took over as leader.\nHe added: \"Colleagues that choose to leave do so for all sorts of reasons, some of them fairly selfish to them.\n\"And I believe that the people of Scotland and our members see what we're doing, see what I'm doing, as the new leader, and have confidence in that.\"\nRelated topics\n- Published2 July 2023"
