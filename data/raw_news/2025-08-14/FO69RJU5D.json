  "title": "'The Tooth Fairy sticks to a budget:' Kids are finding less under their pillows for lost teeth",
  "description": "An annual Tooth Fairy poll shows the value of a lost tooth is on the decline as even the Tooth Fairy's forced to go on a budget.",
  "content": "Times are tough, even for kids.\n\nWhat they\u2019re receiving for each tooth they\u2019re putting under their pillows has fallen 14% to $5.01 from $5.84 last year, marking one of the most significant year-over-year declines in Tooth Fairy giving since Delta Dental began its annual \"Original Tooth Fairy Poll\" 27 years ago.\n\nThe Tooth Fairy is also scaling back on additional gifts. Only 1 in 6 children (16%) receive both money and \u201csomething else,\u201d down from 21% in 2024.\n\nKids may not be happy about the drop in how much money they're getting for each tooth, but their parents still believe the Tooth Fairy helps educate their children about the value of money. The Tooth Fairy\u2019s thriftiness these days shows \u201ceven the Tooth Fairy sticks to a budget,\u201d Delta Dental said in a release.\n\nBesides, kids should take heart that the trend for the value of a tooth has generally been up. Since the poll\u2019s inception in 1998, the average cash gift left by the Tooth Fairy has increased 285% from $1.30 to $5.01 per tooth.\n\nThe first lost tooth is typically the most valuable, the survey of 1,000 parents of children ages 6 to 12 in January showed. One-third of parents say the Tooth Fairy spends more on their child\u2019s first tooth.\n\nHowever, the Tooth Fairy's also cut back here, with the average value dropping 12% to $6.24 from $7.09 over the past year.\n\nHow busy is the Tooth Fairy?\n\nThe Tooth Fairy is busier than ever. She\u2019s visited more than 8 in 10 homes (83%) across the country, up from 78% in 2024.\n\nThat\u2019s great news for kids even if their haul per tooth has shrunk, Delta Dental said. Nearly one-quarter of children (23%) consider the Tooth Fairy's visit one of their favorite surprises of the year, the poll said.\n\n\"We're pleased to see the Tooth Fairy's wings have been in overdrive this year, as each visit is (also) an opportunity to spark conversations with children about strong oral health care practices,\" said Gabriella Ferroni, senior director, strategic communications, for the Delta Dental Plans Association.\n\nDoes a drop in tooth value signal bad economic times?\n\nHistorically, the Original Tooth Fairy Poll has mirrored the economy's overall direction, tracking with the trends of the broad Standard & Poor's 500 Index, Delta Dental said.\n\nHowever, since 2023, the two have diverged. Over the past year, the average value of a single lost tooth decreased 14%, while the S&P 500 rose 26% during the same period, Delta Dental said.\n\nDo kids everywhere get the same amount per tooth?\n\nWhere kids live can make a big difference in how much they get for their teeth, the poll showed.\n\u2022 Southern kids rake it in, receiving $5.71 per tooth, up from $5.51 in 2024, to take the most lucrative spot this year from the West. It was the only region that saw a year-over-year increase.\n\u2022 The West dropped to second place, paying out an average of $5.69 per tooth. That\u2019s 33% lower than 2024 and pushes the region close to its 2021 average of $5.54.\n\u2022 The value of Northeasterners\u2019 teeth also fell 33% to $4.59 each and to below $5.00 per tooth for the first time since 2020.\n\u2022 The Midwest continued to significantly trail the national average for a second consecutive year at under $4 per tooth. Kids in this region are receiving $3.46 per tooth.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

      "text": "The tooth fairy isn't paying as much for teeth this year, contrary to market trends\nIt may be in the tooth fairy's heart to give more this year, but it isn't in her wallet, according to the annual Tooth Fairy Report put out by Delta Dental.\nThe value of a single tooth declined by 6% over the last year, making it the first time in five years parents have decreased their payout. The data, collected from 1,000 families with children ages 6 to 12, comes just in time for National Tooth Fairy Day, celebrated on Feb. 28 each year.\nLast year, the average payout for a child's tooth was $6.23. This year, that amount is $5.84. Additionally, the value of a child's first tooth, a milestone usually met with a larger amount, dropped from $7.29 to $7.09 the past year, according to the poll.\nThis year, it is not a reflection of the economy\nIn the past, Delta Dental's Tooth Fairy Poll has mirrored the direction of the economy, but there has been a plot twist the past year given the S&P 500 saw a 20% increase while data being collected for this report showed declining value.\nHowever, some areas of the country trended up with the economy, increasing the payout for their children's lost teeth.\nWhat's ahead for US economy and jobs: A peek at inflation, interest rates, more\nThe west leads with highest payout for lost teeth\nDespite the national average, the west shows a 37% increase in the value for children's lost teeth since last year.\nParents in the Northeast also boosted their giving 12%, surpassing the national average by more than $1.00, according to the report.\nThe South fell below the national average this year after surpassing it last year and the Midwest saw a significant decrease of 36%.\nThough many look at the report, as many others, as a marker of economic success or distress, Delta Dental hopes to keep a different conversation going.\nGabriella Ferroni, Senior Director of Strategic Communications at Delta Dental Plans Association, says that the poll is a \"timely way to spotlight the importance of children\u2019s oral health.\"\n\u201cDespite the more economical reward, Tooth Fairy giving is a fun conversation starter to encourage good oral hygiene habits at an early age,\" Ferroni shared in a statement."

      "text": "The Tooth Fairy is tightening the purse strings. See the latest average 'gift' per tooth.\nMaintaining a household budget can help a family manage its finances. Interestingly, even the Tooth Fairy adheres to a budget.\nAccording to the latest findings from the Delta Dental 2025 Original Tooth Fairy Poll\u00ae, the average monetary gift left for a lost tooth has decreased by 14% over the past year, dropping from $5.84 to $5.01. This marks one of the most significant decreases in Tooth Fairy contributions since the poll began in 1998.\nThe poll surveyed 1,000 parents with children ages 6 to 12, conducted Jan. 10 to 23.\nFor those who remember receiving a quarter or even a dollar from the Tooth Fairy as a child for losing a tooth, it is interesting to note that since 1998, the average amount given by the Tooth Fairy has increased by 285%. It has risen from $1.30 to $5.01 per tooth.\nThis year, it is not a reflection of the economy\nIn the past, Delta Dental's Tooth Fairy Poll has mirrored the direction of the economy, but the past year given the S&P 500 saw a 26% increase while the average value of a single lost tooth decreased 14%.\nWhere does the Tooth Fairy pay the most?\nThe South was the only region to experience a year-over-year increase, up from $5.51 in 2024 to $5.71. The West, Northeast and Midwest saw a drop but the midwest continued to significantly trail the national average for a second consecutive year at under $4.00 per tooth.\nHow much does the Tooth Fairy give for a child's first tooth?\nHistory of the Tooth Fairy\nIn the \u201cEddas,\u201d the earliest writings of Norse traditions, a custom called \u201ctand-fe\u201d (or \u201ctooth fee\u201d) is mentioned, where adults would pay children a small fee for losing their first tooth. Children's teeth were considered valuable and lucky, with some warriors making necklaces from them for protection in battle.\nThe first published mention of the \u201cTooth Fairy\u201d was found in an article in the Chicago Tribune, dating back to 1908. The section read:\nTooth Fairy. Many a refractory child will allow a loose tooth to be removed if he knows about the Tooth Fairy. If he takes his little tooth and puts it under the pillow when he goes to bed the Tooth Fairy will come in the night and take it away, and in its place will leave some little gift. It is a nice plan for mothers to visit the 5-cent counter and lay in a supply of articles to be used on such occasions. \u2012 Lillian Brown, Tooth Fairy, Chicago Daily Tribune\nThe tooth fairy myth emerged in popular culture over the years, becoming a quintessential part of growing up.\nSource: USA TODAY Network reporting and research; Delta Dental"

The broad S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both notched fresh records.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 463.66 points, more than 1%, to close at 44,922.27, while the broad S&P 500 Index tacked on 20.82 points or 0.3%, and finished the day at 6,466.58. The Nasdaq Composite added 31.24 points, or 0.1%, to close at 21,713.14.\nAfter a tame July inflation report, expectations jumped for a rate cut at the Federal Reserve's policy meeting in September. The CME FedWatch tool that tracks the market's expectations for a rate move at each Fed meeting suggests a more than 94% chance of a Fed rate cut.\nThe benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note lost about 6 basis points to trade near 4.23%.\nWould a quarter-point rate cut be enough?\nThe Fed should consider steep rate cuts, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested in a Bloomberg News interview. \u201cIf you look at any model,\u201d he said, \u201cwe should probably be 150, 175 basis points lower.\u201d\nThe CME FedWatch tool shows the market overwhelmingly expects a cut of only 25 basis points in September.\nTwo days after the Fed left rates unchanged on July 30, revised data showed weaker job growth for May and June than official figures had previously indicated. Bessent also suggested that central bank officials might have cut interest rates in June or July if that information had been available then.\nBut on Wednesday, one Fed official said he was leaning toward waiting before making any changes to interest rate policy. Raphael Bostic, president of the Atlanta Federal Reserve, said the healthy U.S. job market allows policymakers to make gradual changes to rates. Bostic does not currently vote as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee.\nSeparately, Bessent said he was \u201chopeful\u201d Stephen Miran would be approved by the Senate to fill former Governor Adriana Kugler's seat on the Federal Reserve Board by the September meeting. Kugler resigned last week, and Miran would finish out her term.\nCorporate news\n- Cava missed second-quarter revenue growth estimates and lowered its full-year same-store sales forecast. Shares of the restaurant chain slid nearly 17%.\n- Coreweave topped second-quarter sales expectations and increased its third-quarter and full-year revenue outlook above the Street's view. Its adjusted net loss widened significantly from a year ago and missed analysts' expectations. The stock fell 21%, one day before its IPO lockup was due to expire.\n- Stablecoin issuer Circle said it plans to sell 10 million Class A shares to the public, 2 million of which will be offered by the company and the rest from shareholders. Cryptocurrencies have surged in recent weeks: Ethereum is up nearly 60% over the past month, and Solana has gained about 22%.\n- Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange Bullish made its stock market debut Wednesday with the ticker BLSH. The stock closed up nearly 90%.\n- Brinker International, parent company of Chili's and Maggiano's, posted quarterly results that beat analyst expectations.

      "text": "It's Tooth Fairy Day! Here's 5 funny excuses for forgetful tooth fairies\nHail the tooth fairy today \u2014 the mythical, money-leaving, enamel-loving creature that takes the sweet baby teeth of our sleeping children in the dead of night and pays all of $3.70 \u2014 when she (or he) shows up.\nYeah, $3.70 is considered the current \"fair\" price on this National Tooth Fairy Day, according to a poll by Kelton Global on behalf of Delta Dental.\nMaybe parents don't carry cash like they once did, or they're overworked and overtired, but the average price of the precious keepsake has fallen from 2017's average of $4.13.\nWhat can $3.70 buy? Nothing really. Except candy. Not that dentists would be happy about kids using the tooth fairy's bounty to start destroying permanent teeth.\nMore: How much does the Tooth Fairy pay for a lost tooth? It may depend on what's in your wallet\nThey'll be about as happy as children whose parents forget to play tooth fairy, which happens. A lot.\nEarlier this year, Idina Menzel of \"Frozen\" fame dubbed herself one of the #badmoms for forgetting to snatch her son's tooth and leave money. He awoke crying.\n\"The tooth fairy didn't show up last night,\" Menzel posted on Twitter. \"Mom put tooth in tissue and son hid it under pillow. Then mom fell asleep and woke up this morning to son with tears. 'Tooth fairy didn't come.' That tooth fairy better get her s--t together. #badmoms\"\nThe tweet spurred a flurry of advice from parents with fixes for her 9-year-old, Walker. What Menzel came up with is pretty smart, but parents all over the internet have some creative excuses for fairy fails.\nHere are some of the most creative ones we saw \u2026 well, they at least seemed to work.\nThe Tooth Fairy doesn't do same-day service\nIn Menzel's case, she thanked everyone for their advice and said she, too, would be \"perpetuating lies and dishonesty.\" The next day she shared a letter on Twitter the tooth fairy wrote to Walker begging forgiveness.\n\"Please forgive me,\" she wrote. \"Sometimes when your tooth comes out after dinner it is difficult for me to get to you until the next day. Know that I love you and adore you. Please don't lose faith in me!! Love, The Tooth Fairy.\"\nThe Tooth Fairy only has a $20\nThis woman told her son the tooth fairy woke her in the middle of the night \u2014 creeper \u2014 and was short on change.\n\"Completely forgot that the #ToothFairy was supposed to visit Little Man last night,\" @cakepixie888 tweeted. \"Nearly 9 & only lost 3 #teeth. Had to explain that they woke me in the night and explained they were short change & will be back this evening.\"\nUm, Ohhhhhhkaaaaay. Not sure who \"they\" were. At least her son bought it.\nThe Tooth Fairy's a slacker\nNo one said the Tooth Fairy works full-time or isn't entitled to a night off.\n\"Thank goodness it's the Tooth Fairy that handles all the tooth/money exchanges *pours glass of wine & forgets all about it,* tweeted @TheBratRace.\nThis dad says maybe this isn't peak parenting, but it served in the moment.\n\"I convinced my kid the tooth fairy didn't come because she works every other night,\" tweeted @XplodingUnicorn.\nThe Tooth Fairy is having wing surgery. Again.\nThe tooth fairy's frequent flyer miles result in a handful of nights, much like your parents, spent chilling on the couch and streaming Netflix. Please understand.\nAs @CanadianDadBlog tweeted, \"Currently helping my kids make a 'get well' card for the Tooth Fairy who is having wing surgery. Again...\"\nThe Tooth Fairy needs an IOU\nParent @ericsshadow said sometimes the pain is financial. He tweeted he was stalling for a paycheck.\n\"SON: I lost a tooth. I'm gonna leave it under my pillow tonight.\n\"ME: I'd wait until next week.\"\nREAD MORE\n- Idina Menzel joins '#badmoms' who forgot tooth fairy, supportive parents come to the rescue\n- Hoda Kotb and Dylan Dreyer's kids are adorable besties on the beach.

      "text": "Tooth Fairy feels the pinch after overspending\nThe Tooth Fairy is holding her purse strings a bit tighter.\nShe left 8% less this year - or an average of $3.40 for every lost tooth she finds under a pillow - down from $3.70 in 2013, according to a survey from Visa out Thursday. Still, she's leaving more than she did in 2012 before tooth inflation rose 23% from 2012 to 2013.\n\"She's had her wings clipped a little bit,\" says Jason Alderman, Visa's vice president of global financial education. \"Even though it is down, this is the first real decline we've seen even during the recession because Tooth Fairy inflation has far exceeded the rate of traditional inflation.\"\nWhat the tooth fairy does or doesn't leave may be a signal not only of our economic state of mind, but also our cultural attitudes. Visa began tracking the Tooth Fairy's going rate in 2009 as a way to help parents regulate how much they're giving for teeth and to help teach kids about money management. But the Tooth Fairy's generosity may also be loosely tied to consumer confidence - as the \"Tooth Fairy\" feels more exuberant with her spending, kids are more likely to reap the benefits.\nIn 2013, the Tooth Fairy frequently left children with a $20 bill but she's cut back on that type of spending this year. Only 3.6% of Tooth Fairies left $20 or more, down from 6% in 2013. On nights when the Tooth Fairy is supposed to visit, Alderman says fathers are more likely to panic and leave whatever they have in their wallet whereas mothers are more deliberate in determining Tooth Fairy spending. Fathers reported the fairy left an average of $4.20 while moms reported $2.90 - a 45% difference.\n\"There is no value in having the tooth fairy be excessive,\" Alderman says. \"That kind of sanity and stabilization has brought down the average and that's a good thing.\"\nAlderman first started tracking the Tooth Fairy's spending habits after his own children lost their first teeth. He says their fascination with the magical money left by the fairy provided a great opportunity to talk about saving versus spending. The only problem, he says, was that he had no idea what the going rate for a tooth was. He didn't want his kids to be the ones short changed by the Tooth Fairy but didn't want to overspend her resources.\nKit Yarrow, consumer psychologist at Golden Gate University, says she hasn't seen any indication that kids on the playground compete to see who got more from the Tooth Fairy. She says the conversation is always about the fact she visited and the excitement of losing a tooth.\n\"Losing body parts can be disconcerting and it's turned into something magical and fun with the tooth fairy,\" Yarrow says.\nYarrow says children are more fascinated by coins than paper money. So silver dollars or quarters are more exciting, and even trinkets in place of money can do the trick. Alderman says he's settled on $1 per tooth.\nMoney aside, perhaps it's the toothless grins following Tooth Fairy surprises that determine the true value of a lost tooth."
