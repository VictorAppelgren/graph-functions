      "feedback": "The draft is overly verbose, mixes several assets (mortgage rates, DXY) that fall outside the UST 10‑year focus, and contains sentences that lack a direct causal link to the 10‑year yield with an inline citation. Reduce the text to 4–6 bullet points, each ending with a single (ID) citation that ties the claim to the 10‑year. Remove all discussion of mortgage rates, DXY, and any non‑yield‑related commentary. Keep only the Fed‑policy transmission, tariff‑driven risk premium, core PCE, and the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread dynamics. Explicitly state the magnitude range (4.30‑4.35 % over 0‑3 wks) and the catalyst window (Sept FOMC, July PCE, Sept Fed minutes). Add a risk bullet: “Fed hike >25 bp could pull the 10‑year back to 4.0‑4.1 % (7XH2DKEKV)”. End with a watch‑list bullet: “July PCE (2025‑09‑02), Sept Fed minutes (2025‑09‑05), 2‑yr/10‑yr spread evolution (Z7O1DCHS7), mortgage‑rate trend (LF0UUL917)”. Ensure every bullet contains a causal chain and a citation. This will satisfy the 4–6 sentence limit, keep the focus on the 10‑year, and meet the evidence‑driven, market‑mapped requirement.",
