      "feedback": "Solid effort anchoring the 0–3 week view to policy, wage/credit dynamics, and near‑term sentiment; to reach world‑class, tighten the framework and tighten the data: (1) crystallize a three‑part, 0–3 week causal chain with explicit triggers and an explicit invalidation rule (e.g., if BOJ signals a delay or rate hike materializes, or if US payrolls/inflation surprise vs. current fed/boj narrative). Tie each trigger to a citation and a quantifiable move (K0WFSW29E for BOJ wage‑tightening path; H9WSBYP3D for rate‑cut optimism and high‑beta pacing; S7M6BJSRT for macro‑driven personal loan pricing). (2) Build a battle‑tested, numbers‑rich frame by plugging concrete figures from the sources: 8.99–35.49% APR floors on personal loans (H9WSBYP3D); origination fees 1–8% and prepayment penalties 1–5% (S7M6BJSRT/S7M7); Fed‑reported average two‑year personal loan APR ~11.57% (S7M7); national savings average ~0.38% APY (S2); Raisin high‑yield APYs up to 4.31% and signup bonuses (S2, S11); Gainbridge FastBreak APY up to 5.80% (S2, S5). Use these as explicit border conditions and opportunity costs (e.g., projected interest costs from 10k loans under 3‑year vs 7‑year terms; $10k example from S7M6BJSRT/S7M7). (3) Introduce a clear scenario structure (base, upside, downside) for Opendoor and Lucid with explicit price/earnings/earnings‑growth thresholds and near‑term catalysts: Opendoor’s 636% quarterly surge driven by executive change and Cash Plus (H9WSBYP3D); Lucid’s reverse split deliberation amid a -6.9% weekly move and a forecasted 41% revenue growth but large losses (5JQEA5Z1T). Provide exit/invalidations if momentum decouples from fundamentals or if governance moves signal dilution risks. (4) Separate and reconcile conflicts by treating politics/policy risk as a separate risk‑premium channel rather than a primary driver unless gating data supports it; cite YB758UDBU for the policy‑risk backdrop but avoid overstating reliability of a single outlet. (5) Sharpen the monitoring toolkit with concrete levels: Opendoor around $5.01 (OPEN) now, Lucid around $2.03 (LCID) with downside risk if dilution/ cash burn worsens; watch BOJ wage/participation signals (K0WFSW29E) and US credit pricing shifts (S7M6BJSRT) as near‑term gates. (6) Improve citation discipline and avoid over‑reliance on a single source’s narrative; attach citations after each factual assertion and note any potential bias (e.g., Washington Times piece in YB758UDBU). (7) Tighten language to a forward‑looking, first‑principles framework: tie the long‑run inflation/labor‑market dynamics to discount‑rate and risk‑premium implications, then show how near‑term policy signals tilt those discounts across rate‑sensitive names; trim speculative prose and clearly label the near‑term “transmission function” versus longer‑horizon fundamentals.",
