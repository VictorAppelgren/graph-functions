  "content": "Washington, DC, Police Chief Pamela Smith signed an executive order Thursday allowing DC police officers to share information about people not in their custody with federal immigration enforcement agencies such as ICE \u2014 as President Donald Trump continues his federal takeover of law enforcement in the nation\u2019s capital and crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nAlong with providing information in situations like traffic stops, the order also allows DC police to assist federal law enforcement agencies with transporting personnel and detainees.\n\nHowever, the order \u2014 citing DC law and police code of conduct \u2014 continues to prohibit officers from looking through police databases solely for a person\u2019s immigration status, from making inquiries about a person\u2019s immigration status \u201cfor the purpose of determining whether they have violated the civil immigration laws or for the purpose of enforcing civil immigration laws\u201d and from arresting anyone based only on federal immigration warrants.\n\nDC police also may not provide any information about a person in DC police\u2019s custody or allow federal immigration enforcement agents to question them.\n\n\u201cUnder the President\u2019s Executive Order, MPD services have been requested to assist ICE with transportation of detainees and traffic stops,\u201d a DC police spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. \u201cToday\u2019s order was meant to clarify but does not change existing MPD policy and District law.\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out ICE for comment.\n\nDC Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s office declined to comment on the police chief\u2019s executive order.\n\nBowser \u2014 who once proudly touted the nation\u2019s capital as a sanctuary city \u2014 has shied away from describing the city as such while she treads carefully amid a second Trump presidency. In May, Bowser even proposed a repeal of the local law that prohibits the city\u2019s Department of Corrections from cooperating with federal immigration authorities \u201cabsent a judicial warrant or order issued by a federal judge.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by a reporter about the executive order and whether he will require other cities to do the same to avoid a federal takeover, the president said: \u201cI have heard that. It just happened \u2026 That\u2019s a great step if they\u2019re doing that. Yeah, I think that\u2019s going to happen all over the country. We want to stop crime.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Thursday that 29 undocumented migrants \u201cwere removed\u201d from DC on Wednesday night.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday echoed the president, calling the executive order \u201ca game changer\u201d and urging other cities to follow suit.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we need New York City to do. We need LA to do that. We need Chicago to do that,\u201d Noem told Fox News. \u201cWe need all these other leaders to grow up and start sharing this information on these criminals that shouldn\u2019t be in our country in the first place and send them back home to face the consequences for their crimes.\u201d\n\nLate last week, Trump ordered additional federal law enforcement officers to Washington, DC, arguing that crime in the city is rampant. However, city statistics show violent crime has dropped over the past two years after peaking in 2023.\n\nTrump escalated his efforts earlier this week by declaring a crime emergency and federalizing DC\u2019s police force, along with deploying the DC National Guard.",

The order also allows DC police to assist federal law enforcement agencies with transporting personnel and detainees. However, it continues to prohibit officers from looking through police databases solely for immigration status, making inquiries about a person's immigration status for the purpose of determining if they have violated civil immigration laws or for enforcing civil civil laws. The move comes as President Donald Trump continues his federal takeover of law enforcement in Washington, DC and crackdown on illegal immigration. The Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called the executive order a \"game changer\" and urged other cities to follow suit.",

      "text": "The Metropolitan Police along with federal agencies tasked with helping curb crime in the nation\u2019s capital are scrambling to figure out roles and strategy following President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to declare a crime emergency and federalize DC\u2019s police force, multiple sources told CNN.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to restore the city back to the gleaming capital that everybody wants it to be,\u201d Trump said at the White House on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be something very special.\u201d\nBut little communication seems to have been done before Trump\u2019s news conference \u2013 the Washington, DC, mayor and police chief hadn\u2019t been told about the takeover until they watched Trump say it live. It\u2019s led to confusion over who now leads the MPD, how their policing strategy will change and in what ways federal agents \u2013 many who aren\u2019t trained for community policing \u2013 are going to interact with local officers.\nDuring a separate news conference, Mayor Muriel Bowser said she was trying to set up a meeting with Attorney General Pam Bondi, who Trump said would be overseeing the implementation of his order. She also maintained that Chief of Police Pamela Smith would still run the department and report to Bowser up through the deputy mayor.\n\u201cNothing about our organizational chart has changed,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cAnd nothing in the executive order would indicate otherwise.\u201d\nThe Home Rule Act of 1973 allows the president to take control of the city\u2019s police for 48 hours if he \u201cdetermines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist,\u201d which requires the department\u2019s use for federal purposes. The president can retain control of the department for a longer period if he notifies the chairs and ranking members of the congressional committees that handle legislative matters pertaining to DC, which Trump indicated he intends to do. Any request of control over the city\u2019s police department for more than 30 days must be passed into law.\nThis is the first time a president has used Section 740 of the Home Rule Act to federalize the DC metro police, said Dr. Heidi Bonner, chair of the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at East Carolina University.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely difficult to say what that means,\u201d she said, including it being \u201can open question\u201d as to who\u2019s in charge.\n\u201cIs the chief of police still in charge of the department once it\u2019s become federalized?\u201d Bonner asked. \u201cAnd of course, all this is mixed up in the unique nature of DC as a district and not a state. There are different authorities \u2013 the president acts as the governor for all intents and purposes when it comes from the National Guard.\u201d\nWhen asked about the confusion over how MPD will now be run, the Justice Department highlighted portions of Trump\u2019s order that state, \u201cthe Mayor shall provide such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the Attorney General may deem necessary and appropriate.\u201d\nIt remains unclear, however, how such an arrangement will play out practically.\nThe order also says the attorney general will also update Trump if further action might be required from the president.\nBowser seemed resigned to the fact that Trump\u2019s decision would go into effect given the city\u2019s status. Prominent Democrats called Bowser and her office Monday to offer support but indicated there was little they could do to stop the takeover.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to minimize what was said and I don\u2019t want to minimize the intrusion on our autonomy,\u201d Bowser said. The mayor also called the move \u201cunsettling and unprecedented\u201d and advocated for DC statehood to prevent such unilateral action from the president.\nPolice Chief Smith said she was scheduled to meet with federal liaisons following the news conference for the first time regarding Trump\u2019s announcement in order to start to \u201ccreate an operational plan.\u201d\nDC National Guard and FBI agents on the ground\nTrump activated 800 soldiers from the DC National Guard, with up to 200 members being assigned to supporting law enforcement, according to the Defense Department.\n\u201cDuties for those personnel include administrative and logistical roles, as well as providing a physical presence in support of law enforcement,\u201d the DOD said.\nThe unilateral move contrasts heavily with how Trump blamed others, including Bowser and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for not deploying the National Guard on January 6, 2021, before Trump-supporters broke into the US Capitol.\nOver the weekend, Trump had already moved officers from several federal agencies to begin assisting MPD in policing certain areas in DC, including as many as 130 FBI agents to patrol with DC police as part of the increased federal presence, according to two people familiar with the deployment.\nIt\u2019s not typical for FBI agents to patrol with local police, and agents are often not trained for community policing and operate under different policies \u2013 including for use of deadly force \u2013 that could create issues on the ground, two federal law enforcement sources told CNN. Because of this, pairing federal agents with officers to patrol DC could present a situation where each member of the team must respond differently to a potential threat based on the respective agency\u2019s policy.\nIn the FBI, the plan to deploy agents to patrol the streets of Washington has been met with concern over strained resources and the safety of agents who are not trained in routine police patrols, according to multiple sources.\nTaking agents away from their daily investigations to patrol DC would risk not adequately addressing other serious crimes like terrorism, foreign counterintelligence threats, cyber intrusions and the nation\u2019s fentanyl epidemic, sources said.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t hard: If we\u2019re doing (policing) we\u2019re not covering down on those other threats,\u201d said one source.\nFederal agents are also typically only minimally trained in conducting vehicle stops, which remains one of the most dangerous aspects of a police officer\u2019s job. Unlike routine police encounters with suspects, which may only involve one or two officers, when agencies like the FBI conduct an arrest, they typically plan out the operation methodically in advance and execute it with a complement of agents that far outnumbers the suspect.\nDuring the two sparring news conferences Monday, Trump remained adamant that crime in Washington is out of control despite data suggesting that it has decreased in recent years, and Bowser said firmly that DC is \u201cnot experiencing a spike in crime but a decrease in crime.\u201d\nRegardless of the current crime rates, Bonner noted that Trump\u2019s order has a 30-day limit and said any long-term impact on crime is doubtful.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a long-term effect on crime with fast actions like this because it doesn\u2019t get to the root causes,\u201d Bonner said. \u201cAt the end of 30 days, it will be interesting to see what it has done in terms of reducing the crime rate further, or whatever the goals of this operation are, and what they might try to do moving forward to affect some long term fixes.\u201d\n\u201cBecause, again, you\u2019re not going to affect crime in the long term without addressing the symptoms of crimes,\u201d Bonner said.\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional details."

      "text": "The sky is still dark and the sidewalks are eerily empty when Soledad heads to work.\nThe sound of sparrows chirping on a rainy morning is punctuated by the occasional crackle of tires rolling on wet pavement. The city is still waking up. Soledad is, too, walking in the drizzle to a bus stop near her apartment.\nIn about 30 minutes, she\u2019ll punch in and begin her day working as a janitor in a government building where she keeps bathrooms and kitchens clean. A short bus ride from her neighborhood leaves just enough time to grab a quick cup of coffee before her shift begins.\nAt a downtown DC bakery, the cashier flashes a warm smile when she recognizes Soledad walking in. \u201c\u00bfComo est\u00e1?\u201d she asks. How are you?\nSoledad pauses. So many worries are weighing on her. \u201cPues, aqu\u00ed,\u201d Soledad says. Well, I\u2019m here.\nBecause yes, she is here, in a city where she\u2019s lived for more than two decades. But she doesn\u2019t know how much longer she will be.\nSoledad has what\u2019s known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, which provides legal work permits and blocks the government from deporting her and many other immigrants who otherwise would be undocumented. That protection\u2019s days could be numbered; already the Trump administration has said it plans to end TPS for hundreds of thousands of people. Before long, Soledad fears TPS for Salvadorans like her could be next. She agreed to share her perspective with CNN, but asked to be identified only by her first name, and for her face not to be shown, because she fears speaking out could affect her case.\nReminders of the looming threats are everywhere. As she walks from the bus stop to her janitor job, Soledad often passes the White House, where President Trump and administration officials have made no secret of their mass deportation plans.\nAnd at a recent meeting of local activists, the 49-year-old Salvadoran immigrant says she posed a question she\u2019d never expected to ask: \u201cIs Washington a sanctuary city, or isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nDuring the previous Trump administration, DC\u2019s leaders were vocal about protecting immigrant residents. Lately, Soledad says, their silence has spoken volumes.\n\u201cIt makes you feel like you\u2019ve been left alone, like you\u2019ve been abandoned,\u201d Soledad says.\nThe mayor used to call DC a \u2018proud sanctuary city.\u2019 Now she avoids the term\nThere\u2019s not one official definition for \u201csanctuary city,\u201d and different governments have different meanings for the term. Some see the label as more of a symbolic gesture than a move that actually impacts people\u2019s lives. But immigrant rights advocates have long argued that local officials play a critically important role. A city policy can be the difference between someone simply getting a traffic ticket or ending up in deportation proceedings.\n\u201cRight now the immigrant community has two ways to defend ourselves. One is the courts, and the other one is local officials,\u201d says Jaime Contreras, executive vice president of the Service Employee International Union\u2019s 32BJ Capital Area District. \u201cAnd if local officials are running away from our community, that\u2026has a devastating effect.\u201d\nNearly one in four residents of Washington and its surrounding metro area are immigrants, according to Census data. And in the past, Mayor Muriel Bowser frequently called Washington a \u201cproud sanctuary city.\u201d\nIn a budget plan released Tuesday, Bowser took a dramatically different tack, proposing a repeal of the DC law that prohibits the city\u2019s Department of Corrections from cooperating with federal immigration authorities \u201cabsent a judicial warrant or order issued by a federal judge.\u201d CNN is reaching out for further comment on why that measure, dubbed the \u201cDetainer Amendment Act of 2025,\u201d was included in Bowser\u2019s budget.\nThe lines in her budget proposal, which don\u2019t mention the issue directly but would overhaul one of the city\u2019s sanctuary policies, are a marked contrast to the way she discussed immigration issues during Trump\u2019s previous administration, and the latest in a series of shifts from Bowser.\nAnother recent change: the apparent removal of multiple city websites that used the \u201csanctuary city\u201d term.\nAsked about the pages\u2019 apparent removal in recent months, first reported by Axios, a spokesman for the mayor referred to her remarks in a February press conference but declined to comment further. At that event, when asked by a reporter why she\u2019d stopped using the term \u201csanctuary city,\u201d Bowser called the phrase \u201cmisleading.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s misleading to suggest to anyone that if you\u2019re violating immigration laws, this is a place where you can violate immigration laws,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are vulnerable to federal immigration enforcement.\u201d\nAsked what message she\u2019d send to undocumented immigrants in the city, Bowser instead offered what sounded more like a response to conservative critics.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a migrant crisis in our city, so I don\u2019t want anybody to think that we have been overrun and we have a migrant crisis, because we don\u2019t,\u201d she said.\nBowser\u2019s shifting response on immigration matters is one of a number of ways the mayor, a leading figure in the Democratic resistance during Trump\u2019s first term, is now striking a less defiant tone.\nThe changing approach comes as Trump repeats attacks on DC and its leadership, threatening to \u201ctake over\u201d the city.\nThe mayor has a good reason to tread carefully, according to Abel Nu\u00f1ez, executive director of the Central American Resource Center in Washington, an organization that serves the city\u2019s Latino community.\nDC\u2019s status as a federal district puts the city and its more than 700,000 residents in a uniquely precarious position, Nu\u00f1ez says. In 1973, Congress passed a statute allowing DC residents to elect local leaders to run day-to-day affairs, but lawmakers have threatened to reverse that arrangement.\n\u201cThat can be taken away at any moment. We get treated like children. That\u2019s just the reality of it,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez says. \u201cWe\u2019re allowed to manage our own affairs until they don\u2019t see fit for us to do so.\u201d\nAnd no leader would risk her city\u2019s entire future for one group, he says.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to poke the bear. \u2026 You have to choose what your battles are. Dying on the hill of the \u2018sanctuary city\u2019 moniker, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right thing to do. I agree with the mayor,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez says. \u201cYou need to tone it down, shut down the website, do the things you need to do so that you can quietly negotiate.\u201d\nBut some advocates for immigrants are more critical.\nContreras, who represents thousands of cleaners, security officers and maintenance workers at the SEIU, says workers will remember their local leaders\u2019 actions the next time elections come around.\n\u201cSome of these elected officials\u2026benefitted for years from having the support of a certain community, the immigrant community, in particular,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then, when it comes time to defend our community, they run away from the issue as opposed to leaning in and saying, \u2018Wait a minute, these are human beings, these are workers, these are not criminals.\u2019 They run away from us, and that is frustrating and insulting.\u201d\nAnd for immigrants in the community, the impact isn\u2019t just emotional, he says.\n\u201cIt has a devastating effect on how they go about their day. They have to be looking over their shoulders all the time. They see a police officer, they get scared. They see a crime, they\u2019re not going to report it. For safety reasons, it\u2019s just not good,\u201d he says.\nTrump vows \u2018maximum enforcement\u2019 of federal immigration law in DC\nMinutes after stepping to the podium earlier this month for his final press conference as DC\u2019s interim US attorney, Ed Martin said he had a warning for the city\u2019s citizens.\nThe district\u2019s status as a sanctuary city is \u201ccrippling\u201d local law enforcement efforts to make DC safer, Martin said.\n\u201cThere needs to be a robust discussion now about DC\u2019s sanctuary status, and its justice system and its judges, and if that means that home rule is on the table, then so be it,\u201d he said.\nIn the past, DC officials have used the sanctuary city term to describe things like the Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s policy of not asking people about their citizenship or residency status, or city funding for immigrant legal services. In 2020, the City Council passed a \u201cSanctuary Values Amendment Act,\u201d which limits the city\u2019s Department of Corrections from cooperating with federal immigration authorities \u201cabsent a judicial warrant or order issued by a federal judge.\u201d\nMany of the largest cities in the country have sanctuary policies in place. Supporters of the measures argue they keep communities safe by fostering trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement. Critics \u2014 including President Trump \u2014 say they endanger public safety.\nThe second Trump administration has made cracking down on sanctuary cities a pillar of its enforcement strategy, with the president calling them \u201cdeath traps\u201d that protect criminals. A federal judge recently ruled against the administration\u2019s efforts to block federal funding to sanctuary cities, finding that portions of Trump\u2019s executive orders were unconstitutional.\nMeanwhile the Justice Department has threatened to prosecute state and local officials who resist the federal immigration crackdown.\nRepublican leaders in Congress also have criticized sanctuary cities, most notably in a March hearing before a House committee, where lawmakers grilled mayors of prominent sanctuary cities: Boston, Chicago, Denver and New York. DC\u2019s mayor wasn\u2019t asked to appear.\nBut officials have homed in on the capital\u2019s sanctuary policies in other ways.\nTrump\u2019s \u201cMaking the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful\u201d executive order, issued in late March, created a federal task force whose mission includes \u201cmonitoring the district\u2019s sanctuary-city status and compliance with the enforcement of federal immigration law.\u201d The order also calls for the task force to direct \u201cmaximum enforcement\u201d of federal immigration law, and to redirect available law enforcement resources \u201cto apprehend and deport illegal aliens in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.\u201d\nAnd Republicans in the House and Senate have introduced legislation aiming to remove DC\u2019s sanctuary laws, arguing they have \u201cdevastating, real-life consequences.\u201d\nAs he introduced the Senate\u2019s version of the bill last month, Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tennessee, called DC\u2019s policies \u201cunconscionable.\u201d\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s efforts to enforce immigration laws should not be undermined by local leadership anywhere in the United States, let alone Washington, DC,\u201d he said.\nThe way some immigrants see DC is changing\nIt wasn\u2019t long ago that many immigrants saw Washington as one of the safest places to live, according to Antonia Pe\u00f1a, who represents nannies, house cleaners and care workers as a leader of the DC chapter of Care in Action.\nThe district\u2019s policies, including its minimum wage and its protections for workers, were among the best in the region, she says. \u201cAnd in terms of immigration, Washington has always been considered a sanctuary.\u201d\nBut now, she says, given the pressures DC is under from the federal government, many immigrants are starting to see the city differently.\n\u201cWashington right now is becoming the area with the least protection, legally speaking,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that is what we\u2019ve been explaining to people, talking about it and accepting it in a way, because this is a huge impact under this administration, something that no one expected.\u201d\nAlready high costs were making many workers reconsider living in the city, she says. \u201cNow this is going to become one more reason to move out of DC,\u201d she says.\nJust a few months into the new Trump administration, leaders of immigrant advocacy organizations in DC say fears are running high.\n\u201cThe need is so big and the threats are so big. \u2026 I\u2019m running out of resources, because we\u2019re tapped out,\u201d says Rev. Julio Hern\u00e1ndez of the Congregation Action Network.\nRecently, he says he\u2019s gotten calls about people who\u2019ve been evicted because some landlords no longer want to rent to undocumented immigrants. Many are worried the district\u2019s police department could be federalized, he says, converting the officers who patrol communities into immigration agents.\n\u201cThere is a big concern of what could come,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez says. \u201cThe feeling is, if there\u2019s more funding, then there will be a greater increase in immigration raids. And DC is a pretty easy target. \u2026 If they lose their self-rule, we feel there\u2019s an even bigger danger for the city and for its residents.\u201d\n\u2018We are the only people that can keep us safe\u2019\nProtesters pack into a park for a rally in DC\u2019s Mount Pleasant neighborhood on a spring evening. Soledad is in the crowd.\nIn the past, she might have joined the speakers on stage, sharing her story. But today, she\u2019s watching from the sidelines. Organizers of this protest told her they were worried noncitizens could be targeted for speaking out.\nSo Soledad doesn\u2019t tell this crowd about the years she\u2019s spent fighting for immigrant rights, or about her 15-year-old daughter, a star student \u2014 and US citizen \u2014 who\u2019s often stood alongside her. Instead, she listens.\nSome speakers at the rally are wearing masks to protect their anonymity.\n\u201cHow is it possible that being an immigrant in DC means living in fear?\u201d one speaker asks.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I moved to DC that I felt like I belonged in this country,\u201d another says.\n\u201cWith the silence of our elected officials, I feel they are giving away our rights. \u2026 We are the only people that can keep us safe.\u201d\nOrganizers and participants at this protest say DC\u2019s leaders should do more to fight back against Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.\n\u201cWe fought hard to create the sanctuary policies, and we\u2019re not going to let Congress eliminate them without a fight,\u201d Oliver Merino of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center tells CNN affiliate WJLA. \u201cThe community wants the mayor, the city council, to step up and to publicly say they will protect our sanctuary policies that keep our community safe.\u201d\nAn organizer onstage says that members of the City Council were invited to the event, but none of them showed up.\nOne by one, each council member\u2019s name is read from a list, then their photo is taped to a railing onstage.\n\u201cIs he here or is he missing?\u201d the organizer asks, craning her neck and looking out at the crowd like a sailor scanning the horizon.\nIt doesn\u2019t take long for the crowd to answer: \u201cMISSING!\u201d\nA few council members\u2019 photos fall off the railing in the evening breeze.\n\u201cEven the papers are scared,\u201d someone quips in the crowd.\nWhy \u2018silent sanctuary\u2019 may be DC\u2019s new strategy\nAsked via email whether DC remains a sanctuary city, the offices of the city\u2019s 13 sitting council members didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\nIt\u2019s no surprise to find critics of the president\u2019s immigration crackdowns in DC. Trump won less than 7% of votes cast here in the last presidential election.\nBut DC isn\u2019t like other liberal cities, according to Rick Su, a distinguished professor of law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Many cities that get in standoffs over immigration with the federal government have states to protect them, he says.\n\u201cThe funny thing and the scary thing is that DC is essentially\u2026a creature of the federal government, of Congress, of the president,\u201d Su says.\nThough it\u2019s unclear whether Congress really wants to take on the challenge of running the city again, Su says, lawmakers could pass another statute to retake control.\nGiven that reality, Su says it appears the city\u2019s leaders are currently pursuing a policy he\u2019s dubbed \u201csilent sanctuary.\u201d\n\u201cWe can still do our thing,\u201d Su says city leaders are likely thinking, \u201cas long as we keep a very friendly and\u2026submissive public face.\u201d\nShe worries ICE could show up, but still leads the crowd in her favorite protest chant\nSoledad walks in front of the Supreme Court carrying a tote bag emblazoned with the three red stars and two red stripes of DC\u2019s flag.\nShe sets it down near the building\u2019s steps and pulls out several banners and a megaphone she\u2019s tucked inside. Soledad and dozens of others are holding a vigil to support Temporary Protected Status, which the Trump administration has said it\u2019s ending for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans. In a matter of weeks, a Supreme Court decision will clear the way for the administration\u2019s plan to take effect while legal challenges over the matter continue in court.\nBut on this evening in early May, Soledad and the other protesters say they\u2019re pushing to bring attention to their cause before it\u2019s too late.\nEven though it\u2019s been raining all afternoon, a sizeable crowd has gathered, and the sun is coming out. But many of those gathered are worried \u2013 not just about the court\u2019s looming decision, but about reports and rumors that have been swirling in the city all week.\nHomeland Security Investigations agents served more than 100 notices of inspection at businesses around the DC area. The agency said it was an effort to ensure compliance with immigration and employment laws.\nBowser told reporters the district\u2019s police weren\u2019t involved, and that she was \u201cdisturbed\u201d by what she\u2019d heard had unfolded.\n\u201cIt appears that ICE is at restaurants or even in neighborhoods,\u201d she said, \u201cand it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re targeting criminals. It is disrupting.\u201d\nA coalition of immigrant advocacy groups slammed the mayor for appearing at an event with Trump while reports of the enforcement effort left immigrant communities in the city terrified.\nSoledad is worried ICE agents could show up at this protest, and she knows others are concerned about that, too.\nRecently she\u2019s been more cautious about speaking out. At a protest she attended earlier this month, she loaned out her megaphone to amplify someone else\u2019s voice.\nWith each day that passes, though, she\u2019s growing more concerned about what could happen if she doesn\u2019t speak out than what will happen if she does. For her and so many others whose lives are at stake, she says, staying quiet simply isn\u2019t an option.\nShe can\u2019t imagine being forced to abandon the life she\u2019s worked hard to build or having to take her daughter away from the only home she\u2019s ever known.\n\u201cUn pueblo \u00fanido jam\u00e1s ser\u00e1 vencido,\u201d she shouts into the megaphone. A people united will never be defeated.\nFollowing her lead, the crowd repeats the popular protest mantra. Then Soledad belts out a less common line that\u2019s become her favorite chant:\n\u201cUn pueblo callado jam\u00e1s ser\u00e1 escuchado.\u201d\nThe people who are silent will never be heard.\nCNN\u2019s Gabe Cohen contributed to this report."

      "text": "The Trump administration ordered an increase of the federal law enforcement presence in Washington, DC, starting Thursday night, the White House said.\n\u201cPresident Trump has directed an increased presence of federal law enforcement to protect innocent citizens. Starting tonight, there will be no safe harbor for violent criminals in D.C,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump is committed to making our Nation\u2019s capital safer for its residents, lawmakers, and visitors from all around the world.\u201d\nA White House official confirmed to CNN that Thursday\u2019s mobilization will include federal officers in \u201cmarked units, and highly visible.\u201d\nThe increased presence was to begin at midnight as part of a seven-day effort, with the option to extend, the official added. The effort is led by US Park Police, with participation from US Capitol Police, FBI, US Marshals Service, DC Police, DEA and other agencies.\nIt is \u201cfocused on high-traffic tourist areas and other known hotspots,\u201d according to the official.\nAs of Friday afternoon, CNN reporters did not see an apparent increase in law enforcement presence at popular tourist and commercial areas in the city, including the National Mall, Union Station and U Street Northwest.\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms\u2019 DC field office posted on X in the early hours of Friday morning that the agency was patrolling the district, writing: \u201cTogether @ATFWashington with our federal law enforcement partners are out ensuring that the residents of the District of Columbia are safer this evening.\u201d\nFederal authorities on the first night seized a 40-caliber pistol, more than 100 suspected Fentanyl pills and 164 grams of marijuana in one traffic stop, according to the White House official. Four people in the car were arrested, the official said. Another traffic stop netted a 9mm pistol and more than 140 grams of crack cocaine.\nUS Park Police, which is leading the effort, posted pictures of the guns and drugs on X.\nMore than 120 federal law enforcement officers will be on the streets of DC over the next several days, according to the official.\nCNN has reached out to DC Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s office for comment but hasn\u2019t received a response. Eleven of 12 members of the DC City Council did not respond or declined to a request for comment. Council member Christina Henderson attributed crime in the city to the Trump and Biden administrations not nominating enough judges to handle the local caseload.\nDel. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a non-voting delegate who represents DC in Congress, called the administration\u2019s actions \u201coffensive.\u201d\n\u201cSending in the FBI, DEA, Homeland Security officers and others throughout the District in response to an assault where the existing police presence was sufficient to catch two assailants as they were leaving the scene is a disproportionate overreaction that\u2019s offensive to D.C.,\u201d Norton said. \u201cMoreover, this needless escalation will heighten tensions and potentially make D.C., which achieved its lowest violent crime rate in 30 years in 2024, less safe.\u201d\nCNN previously reported that the Trump administration had been making plans to increase federal law enforcement in the nation\u2019s capital.\nIn announcing the increase Thursday, the White House pointed to several high-profile crimes in DC, including the killing of two Israeli Embassy staff members in May. The announcement came just days after a well-known former Department of Government Efficiency staffer was assaulted in DC.\nBut according to a preliminary year-to-date crime comparison from DC Police, 2025 crime numbers are lower than last year\u2019s. As of Thursday, violent crime is down 26%, according to the DC Police.\nThe White House official added that the actions being taken Thursday night are \u201cin compliance\u201d with the \u201cMaking the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful\u201d executive order the president signed in March.\nThat order aims to ensure that \u201call applicable quality of life, nuisance, and public-safety laws are strictly enforced,\u201d including crimes involving assault, battery, larceny, graffiti, public intoxication and more.\nOn Wednesday, the president said he is considering having his administration take over the DC Police Department and might deploy the National Guard to DC over recent crime.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to beautify the city. We\u2019re going to make it beautiful. And what a shame, the rate of crime, the rate of muggings, killings and everything else. We\u2019re not going to let it, and that includes bringing in the National Guard maybe very quickly too,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.\nA spokesperson for the DC National Guard told CNN on Friday morning that it had not been activated.\n\u201cContrary to some social media posts the DC National Guard is not activated currently for the support. Please contact the White House for questions concerning the POTUS\u2019s comments this week,\u201d said Master Sgt. Arthur Wright. \u201cAs for the current ops of the DCNG, the presence of National Guardsmen and vehicles seen this week and throughout the weekend are related to required training for UTA (Unit Training Assembly).\u201d\nEarlier this year, Trump said that the federal government should \u201ctake over\u201d DC.\n\u201cI think that we should govern District of Columbia. It\u2019s so important, the DC situation. I think that we should run it strong, run it with law and order,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One in February.\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional details.\nCNN\u2019s Brian Todd contributed to this report."
