  "title": "In Dodgers rematch, Padres feel the power of Petco Park\u2019s home-field advantage",
  "description": "Only one team, the league-leading Milwaukee Brewers, has a better winning percentage at home than the Padres.",
  "content": "SAN DIEGO \u2014 Less than a week after the end of an anticlimactic series in his home stadium, Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts sat in the visiting dugout at Petco Park as a crowd of reporters fanned around him. It was two hours before the start of Friday\u2019s rematch with the San Diego Padres \u2014 and, in this building, the start of a nightly exercise in raucous enthusiasm.\n\nDid the upcoming game have a different feel to it than Roberts\u2019 experience last weekend in Chavez Ravine, where the Dodgers swept the Padres out of first place?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI think the only difference from our perspective is we\u2019re playing here versus at home. This is a fun place to play a baseball game. Obviously, we ended up playing really well last week, kind of chasing those guys, and now we\u2019ve got a game lead.\u201d\n\nTwo hours later, the Padres embarked on an evening of demonstrating that difference. It did not matter that much of a sellout crowd wore the colors of a rival; Dodgers fans, even amid the Padres\u2019 rise to prominence this decade, have long infiltrated their favorite team\u2019s games in downtown San Diego. It probably mattered that this was the 56th sellout of the year. With the possible exception of Philadelphia\u2019s Citizens Bank Park, there is no home-field advantage that looks and sounds quite like it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s electric,\u201d Yu Darvish said after a 2-1 win moved the Padres back into a tie atop the National League West. \u201cI\u2019ve been to many stadiums, and there have been a lot of good stadiums, too. But just how supportive and loud this stadium is, you receive that energy and the power from the fans.\u201d\n\nThe 44,864 in attendance had fueled San Diego\u2019s 42nd victory in 63 home games. Darvish, a 39-year-old veteran of various competitions on either side of the Pacific Ocean, channeled the adrenaline in his best, most in-command start of the season. The Japanese icon allowed one walk and one hit, a solo homer. It was a noticeable contrast from his four-inning, four-run outing Sunday at Dodger Stadium.\n\nThere, the Padres bungled their way through three largely embarrassing games. They fell to 31-35 on the road. They lost the season series to the Dodgers and, along with it, a crucial tiebreaker.\n\nStill, it was not the end of the world. The Padres were not the only postseason contender with a mediocre record away from home. And despite their disappointment, they could take comfort in their drive down Interstate 5.\n\nThat\u2019s because here, at Petco Park, they have consistently bottled successful baseball. Only one team, the league-leading Milwaukee Brewers, has a better winning percentage at home. The Padres have not lost a series in the East Village since the second week of June, when the Dodgers took two of three games.\n\n\u201cWe definitely knew what type of team we are, what we\u2019re capable of doing,\u201d third baseman Manny Machado said following a fourth consecutive home victory. \u201cIt didn\u2019t show up (last weekend), but it\u2019s part of it. You know, sometimes it just doesn\u2019t happen. It showed up Sunday. We fell short, and then we continued playing good baseball here, and we get back to it. We know what we\u2019re capable of doing. We\u2019ve just got to continue doing it.\u201d\n\nFriday, the Padres did not do everything well. The bottom of the third provided a conspicuous example. Less than a week after they ran into three outs against former San Diego starter Blake Snell, they ran into another when outfielder Ram\u00f3n Laureano, thinking that teammate Fernando Tatis Jr. had struck out on a check swing, got caught between second base and third. The inning ended with the home team trailing 1-0.\n\nStill, in a game of narrow margins, the Padres did enough. The bottom of the fourth, for instance, brought a string of precision offense: a Tatis leadoff walk, a Luis Arraez sacrifice bunt, a Machado RBI single, a Ryan O\u2019Hearn lefty-on-lefty single and a Xander Bogaerts go-ahead sacrifice fly. When Darvish vacated the mound after six efficient innings, the Padres still led by a run.\n\nThen, a league-best bullpen did everything it could to protect that advantage. The most memorable sequence unfolded in the top of the eighth when, after issuing a pair of walks, reliever Mason Miller picked a short hop at first base to complete a 3-6-1, inning-ending double play.\n\n\u201cHe saved the day,\u201d Bogaerts, the shortstop, said. \u201cHe helped me out with that bad throw right there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to say thank you to Miller,\u201d Arraez, the first baseman, said.\n\n\u201cThat was impressive,\u201d Machado said. \u201cWith all the (pitchers fielding practice) you do, I don\u2019t think you can simulate that, especially with how the game was at the time, the adrenaline flowing.\u201d\n\nMiller, the prize of the Padres\u2019 trade deadline, could attest. Less than four weeks ago, he was still pitching in a Triple-A ballpark in West Sacramento, Calif., where the Athletics average fewer than 10,000 fans per game.\n\nNow, he is performing in front of one of the sport\u2019s biggest ongoing parties. The Padres rank third in the majors in average attendance. They are first in average percent of capacity. Most nights, there is little room left; the Padres, like they did the past two years, average a sellout per game. Petco Park is on pace to draw 3.4 million fans, which would break the record set in 2024.\n\n\u201cThe energy here is great every single night,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAs a player, you feel the energy of the game itself.\u201d\n\nThe combination of the setting and the opponent helped explain another unusual play. Early in his career, Machado underwent two knee surgeries after sustaining a pair of gruesome injuries running to first base. He turned 33 last month, and spent much of the past decade attempting to preserve his body on the base paths.\n\nYet there in the bottom of the eighth was the veteran infielder, sprinting on a ground ball and sliding headfirst into first base. It hardly mattered that he was thrown out.\n\n\u201cThis guy hasn\u2019t had a day off all year,\u201d Padres manager Mike Shildt said. \u201cIt says a lot when your best player, or one of your best players, is giving that kind of effort. It sends the right message to the team.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think getting extra runs is always huge for our bullpen,\u201d Machado said. \u201cSo, I was just trying to get that extra run. Couldn\u2019t beat it out on my legs. I ain\u2019t got that speed no more. But obviously, I didn\u2019t with the slide either, so I probably won\u2019t be doing that no more.\u201d\n\nAn extra run indeed would have been nice. In the top of the ninth, Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani blasted a high fly ball to center field. The drive arced through the San Diego night as the home fans teetered with anxiety. Then, they roared as the ball landed in the glove of defensive replacement Bryce Johnson as he stood on the warning track. Perhaps in another ballpark, it would have gone out for a tying home run.\n\nA few batters later, closer Robert Suarez blew a 101.6 mph fastball by Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez for the 27th out and San Diego\u2019s 73rd win. If the Padres finish the regular season with at least one more victory than the Dodgers, they will give themselves home-field advantage at the start of the playoffs. Securing the National League\u2019s top wild-card berth \u2014 they trail the Chicago Cubs by one game \u2014 would produce the same result.\n\nThat, as Friday reinforced, could mean everything.\n\n\u201cGames like this are a little bit bigger than some other ones,\u201d Miller said, \u201cbut yeah, the fans being there the whole time, it\u2019s an awesome place to play.\u201d",

      "text": "SAN DIEGO \u2014 Extracted at considerable cost from the major-league outpost of West Sacramento, Calif., Mason Miller debuted for the Padres wearing a number that recalled one of the biggest trade deadline deals ever.\n\u201cWell, 19 was my A\u2019s number,\u201d Miller, the former Athletics closer, said late Friday at Petco Park. \u201cObviously, that doesn\u2019t play here.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMiller had settled on 22, the date two Octobers ago when he married his wife, Jordan. Maybe it was fitting that it happened to be the same number still worn by a certain New York Mets star; the weekend would mark the third anniversary of outfielder Juan Soto\u2019s acquisition by San Diego.\nAt the same time, Miller\u2019s imposing presence served as a reminder of two other not-so-distant blockbusters.\nNine summers ago, the Chicago Cubs sent a four-player package led by top shortstop prospect Gleyber Torres to a retooling New York Yankees team in exchange for a few months with 6-foot-4 closer Aroldis Chapman. It was less than a week later that the Yankees shipped 6-foot-7 setup man Andrew Miller to Cleveland, receiving top outfield prospect Clint Frazier and touted pitching prospect Justus Sheffield as part of the return. That fall, Chapman and Andrew Miller took down many of the highest-leverage innings for their respective clubs in the 2016 World Series.\nSoon, Mason Miller might have a similar opportunity. The Padres paid a steep price \u2014 top shortstop prospect Leo De Vries and pitching prospects Braden Nett, Henry Baez and Eduarniel N\u00fa\u00f1ez \u2014 to add the 6-foot-5 right-hander and his four-plus years of club control to a league-leading bullpen that already featured three All-Stars. Team officials believe Miller can someday return to being a starter, a role he briefly held as a rookie, but general manager A.J. Preller\u2019s latest deadline blockbuster was about, more than anything, the immediate future.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a super talented pitcher,\u201d Preller said, \u201cand I think \u2026 the focus now is, go do his job that he\u2019s been so good at doing in the bullpen and help us win a championship.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a decidedly modern vision. Hours before the deadline, the Padres entered Thursday needing a left fielder, a catcher and, they could have argued, another reliever. They ended up getting all of that plus a bit more. Yet, despite Miller\u2019s ninth-inning experience, they did not move the likely expiring contract of closer Robert Suarez. And they reserved their heaviest spending for what has traditionally been deemed the sport\u2019s most fungible asset.\nAdvertisement\nThey were not alone. As teams loaded up for another October with an expanded postseason, relievers ruled the deadline like never before. The Mets dealt a total of eight prospects to three teams for Ryan Helsley, Tyler Rogers and Gregory Soto. The crosstown Yankees, through equally voluminous transactions, landed Camilo Doval, David Bednar and Jake Bird. In the eyes of some scouts, the Philadelphia Phillies forked over a pair of top-100 prospects for Jhoan Duran.\nBut it was Miller, one of 10 current or former closers traded in a weeklong span, who commanded the largest return. De Vries has a case as the highest-ranked prospect ever dealt for a reliever. More modest evaluations of the teenager, who might not stay at shortstop, still project rare upside.\nThat potential convinced the A\u2019s to surrender the sport\u2019s hardest thrower. After encountering resistance in their pursuit of Miller, Preller and assistant general manager Josh Stein put their own previously off-limits player up for discussion.\n\u201cIt took a player the caliber of De Vries to get our attention and get us to the negotiating table. \u2026 In Mason\u2019s case, we knew it was going to take something special,\u201d A\u2019s general manager David Forst told reporters after the trade deadline. \u201cWhen the Padres suggested they were open to including Leo, that\u2019s kind of when this got serious.\u201d\nThe Padres gave up more talent for Miller than they did for Josh Hader in 2022, or for Jason Adam and Tanner Scott in 2024. Adam has remained this season as a member of manager Mike Shildt\u2019s \u201cFour Horsemen\u201d \u2014 Suarez, Adrian Morejon and Jeremiah Estrada also have been among the National League\u2019s most effective relievers \u2014 and Miller\u2019s arrival should amplify a preexisting strength. The 2024 American League All-Star is not expected to immediately supplant Suarez, the major-league saves leader; for now, Shildt has even more options for any number of high-leverage innings.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe added to our stable,\u201d Shildt said.\n\u201cIf you get a lead in the first inning, it\u2019s like the other team\u2019s going to start panicking because they know what we have in the back end,\u201d first baseman and outfielder Gavin Sheets said. \u201c(Infielder Jake Cronenworth) and I were joking \u2026 can you imagine seeing Mason Miller getting loose in the fifth inning if you\u2019re on the other team?\u201d\n\u201cIf we have an opportunity to shorten the game,\u201d Preller said, \u201cyou want to take that.\u201d\nThe entire sport has increasingly sought out those opportunities.\nOctober, in particular, is the domain of the bullpen. In 2017, big-league relievers combined to log more than 300 playoff innings for the first time. They have since reached that threshold every year except 2019. In 2020, when there were 28-man rosters during a pandemic-shortened campaign, relievers worked more than 50 percent of all postseason innings. They did so again last October. Much of that came from an injury-riddled Los Angeles Dodgers club; at one point, the eventual champions cobbled together 24 consecutive scoreless innings to close out the National League Division Series.\nWith that defeat still in mind, the Padres this weekend provided glimpses of a potential playoff strategy. Miller, following starter Nick Pivetta in Friday\u2019s series opener against the St. Louis Cardinals, debuted with a scoreless eighth inning. He hit 102.8 mph with his second fastball, matching Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz for San Diego\u2019s hardest pitch since at least 2008. Miller gave way to Suarez in the ninth. The incumbent closer soon secured his 31st save of the year.\nSunday, less than 48 hours later, Dylan Cease supplied five scoreless innings before leaving with a two-run lead. Shildt summoned Adam, the All-Star setup man, to pitch in the sixth for just the second time this season. After a 1-2-3 inning, the manager turned to Estrada in the top of the seventh. The right-hander with the explosive fastball struck out the side on 10 pitches. In the bullpen, Miller began to warm up for a potential appearance in the eighth.\nAdvertisement\nThen, the Padres\u2019 newly lengthened lineup erupted for four runs. Miller sat down. Rookie David Morgan entered the game and, like Estrada, struck out three consecutive batters. Morejon took the mound in the ninth and had an uncharacteristic outing; the Cardinals loaded the bases and scored twice. Suddenly, the situation called for a save. Suarez, Morejon\u2019s fellow All-Star, came in and allowed one inherited runner to score. He stranded the rest to send the Padres to a 7-3 win, their seventh victory in eight games.\nPreller\u2019s latest avalanche of trades had resulted in a palpable boost.\n\u201cI love that about A.J. (Preller). We\u2019re all in,\u201d Adam said amid another series of sellout crowds. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to win. And I think that\u2019s what these fans deserve. \u2026 We want to win a World Series for them.\u201d\nIn 2025, this is what all in looks like: another possibly exorbitant, potentially historic blockbuster \u2014 except with a reliever as the prize.\n(Top photo: Chadd Cady / Imagn Images)"

      "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Mookie Betts declared his season over. Then it got going. The Los Angeles Dodgers star is mired in the worst season of his career, but released himself from the trappings of expectation. That\u2019s what it took for him to find a swing as free as the one he had on Sunday afternoon, when he unleashed on a fastball from an All-Star closer and sent it into the left field bleachers, punctuating a massive weekend at Chavez Ravine for the Dodgers.\nAdvertisement\nOne swing does not cleanse a season that has raised Betts\u2019 self-doubt. Rather, it was a reminder of how dangerous a functional Betts can be for a Dodgers team that needs him as much as ever. They needed him on Sunday, when they squandered an early four-run lead and stared down the barrel of one of the deepest bullpens in the sport. Betts took a center-cut fastball from Robert Su\u00e1rez and barreled it, watching it fly and enjoying every last bit of it. With clarity has come relief.\n\u201cFinally, I did something good for the boys that\u2019s with the bat,\u201d Betts said.\nWith one swing, Betts issued another reminder of what he\u2019s capable of. The Dodgers, by sweeping the San Diego Padres with a 5-4 win on Sunday, did the same, reclaiming sole possession of first place in the NL West through a renewed, focused level of play and a bullpen currently held together by duct tape.\nThey won despite watching a 4-0 first-inning lead disappear, and despite needing five different pitchers to record the game\u2019s final 12 outs. Alex Vesia, who had allowed runs in each of his last four appearances, lobbied his way to record the last five of those outs while retiring the top of the Padres\u2019 order to close it out.\nMOOOOOOOOOK! pic.twitter.com/xpaTB4JKDN\n\u2014 Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) August 17, 2025\nThis is the version of the Dodgers they have been looking to capture over six weeks of self-described middling play, the version capable of elevating its focus when needed. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts loathed the idea of calling it a switch his club was capable of turning on \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous way to live,\u201d Roberts said Sunday morning \u2014 but if there is one, it was flipped on for this weekend.\nSunday, it meant jumping all over a poor first inning from Yu Darvish, as Freddie Freeman and Andy Pages each launched home runs. Tyler Glasnow turned in the latest strong performance from a Dodgers starter, giving them a two-run lead to hold when he exited after five innings. Roberts deployed his bullpen aggressively, from firing on Anthony Banda and Ben Casparius in the sixth to asking the struggling Blake Treinen to take down the heart of San Diego\u2019s lineup in the seventh. He brought in Vesia with one out in the eighth inning to try to hold a one-run lead in relief of Alexis D\u00edaz, despite Justin Wrobleski being the only available reliever behind him. When a soft ground ball brought the tying run home, Vesia argued his case to his manager: if the Dodgers were to retake the lead, he would be good to keep going into the ninth.\nAdvertisement\nRoberts agreed with little hesitation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those moments where you\u2019ve got to just trust your player, and I trusted him,\u201d Roberts said.\nVesia went up the tunnel toward the clubhouse and watched on a monitor as Betts watched a pair of Su\u00e1rez fastballs miss off the plate to lead off the eighth inning. The next one missed right down the middle. Betts crushed it, and Vesia\u2019s day kept going. He recorded the last three outs for a bullpen that, despite coughing up a lead on Sunday, allowed just three runs in 10 innings over the weekend against a team that entered as one of the hottest in the sport.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the dawg, right?\u201d Vesia said, alluding to the nickname the bullpen adopted during last October\u2019s World Series run. \u201cWe still have that. That doesn\u2019t just go away. Every single one of us, we\u2019re leaning on each other. And we know as a group how good we are.\u201d\nThis weekend is a reminder of what that bullpen is capable of, especially as they get closer to health with Michael Kopech, Kirby Yates and Tanner Scott all either on or nearing rehab assignments.\nIt was also a reminder of what Betts is capable of. Eight days have passed since Betts declared his season over; for as many strides as he made defensively in his unprecedented move to shortstop at age 32, his offensive struggles had consumed him \u2014 until he stopped carrying those struggles with him. In those eight days, Betts has gone 11-for-36 (.306) while looking much like his old self in the process.\n\u201cEvery at-bat is the same at this point,\u201d Betts said. \u201cJust trying to do something productive. It definitely helps to not carry burdens from previous at-bats.\u201d\nThat even extended to his at-bat against Su\u00e1rez. He ramped up his aggression because the count and the pitch dictated it. He swung without hesitation, with a short and compact swing still capable of producing the power that elevated Betts to superstar status.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cTo get into a good count and turn that fastball around, that\u2019s the Mookie we like,\u201d Roberts said.\n\u201cMookie Betts is gonna be Mookie Betts, and no one here is worried about him,\u201d Freeman said.\nNor is there much reason for panic surrounding these Dodgers, who have rebounded from an ugly season sweep to the fourth-place Angels to put together three of their most resounding wins of the season. Given the opponent and the increasing stakes of a tight division race with 38 games remaining, it comes at a good time.\n\u201cGotta keep it going, keep our foot on the gas,\u201d Freeman said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in that clubhouse doubted our abilities and how good we can be,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cHonestly, it was just good to play a really good series (from) start to finish. I think we respect those guys, I think they respect us, and now we\u2019ve got to turn the page and move on.\u201d\n(Photo of Alex Vesia and Mookie Betts celebrating Sunday\u2019s win: Jonathan Hui /Imagn Images)"

  "argos_summary": "The Padres beat the Dodgers 2\u20111 at Petco Park, with Yu Darvish delivering a dominant start and the bullpen sealing the win, highlighting the stadium\u2019s electric home\u2011field advantage.  Mason Miller, a key acquisition in the trade deadline, showcased his power\u2011pitching prowess in a sellout crowd, while veteran Manny Machado\u2019s effort underscored the team\u2019s resilience.  Meanwhile, the Dodgers, after a shaky season, rallied behind Mookie Betts\u2019 late\u2011season resurgence and a bruised bullpen to reclaim first place in the NL West, demonstrating the importance of timely offense and pitching depth.",
