It became a story and so I had to answer questions about it,\u201d Mahomes said in the ESPN docuseries \u201cThe Kingdom,\u201d which airs on Aug. 14.\nMahomes\u2019 father Pat, a former New York Mets pitcher, has a history of arrests and stints in jail for DWI convictions.\nIn Feb. 2024, just days before his son won a third Super Bowl, he was arrested for another and served 10 days in jail.\n\u201cI think just knowing that it hurt me, woke him up to know that like you can\u2019t keep doing the same things,\u201d Mahomes said.\nIn the docuseries, Pat admits how he felt after his son was forced to field questions about his arrest.\n\u201cIt kind of hit home before the Super Bowl last year, when I got in trouble. For him to have to answer questions about me, you know, was probably the most embarrassing thing that I\u2019ve ever been through in my life,\u201d he revealed.\n\u201cI called him right after \u2026 I said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry that it\u2019s taken away from your time and focus.\u2019 \u2026 I made a vow that he would never have to deal with anything because of drinking because of me. I haven\u2019t had a drink since then.\u201d\nMahomes\u2019 wife Brittany also spoke about her father-in-law\u2019s road to recovery in the doc.\n\u201cI think it finally hit him that, you know, \u2018I have my kids watching me, I have my grandkids now that are watching me,'\u201d she said.\n\u201cHe really enjoys watching his son play football and live out his dream.\u201d\nAnd Mahomes agreed.\n\u201cFor him to be there supporting me, that\u2019s really cool cause those moments are just moments that you won\u2019t ever get again and he\u2019s been there for all of them this last year,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe Kingdom\u2019s\u201d two-time Emmy Award winning director, Kristen Lappas, who conducted 120 hours of interviews for the docuseries, also wasn\u2019t expecting Mahomes\u2019 father to speak with her.\n\u201cI was surprised that his dad agreed to sit down for an interview and was as forthcoming as he was about his struggles. I do think it allows you to understand Patrick in a different and new way,\u201d she said.\nLappas, whose father Steve was a college basketball coach at schools like Villanova University, was told her experience as a \u201ccoach\u2019s kid\u201d would help her to earn the trust of Chiefs coach Andy Reid \u2014 who was \u201capprehensive\u201d about the project at first.\n\u201cHe is notoriously known as one of the coaches that is old school, doesn\u2019t let cameras in his locker rooms, doesn\u2019t let people around the practice facility,\u201d explained Lappas, whose recent projects include \u201cFull Court Press,\u201d a docuseries on WNBA stars Caitlin Clark, Kamilla Cardoso and Kiki Rice, and \u201cGiannis: The Marvelous Journey,\u201d about NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo.\nLappas and her crew were given access to the Chiefs\u2019 field at Arrowhead Stadium; locker room; training room; and their underground archive room, the first time cameras were ever let into the space.\n\u201cThe Chiefs have kept their artifacts and library down there for half a century. And no player or coach had ever been brought down there. So that was like the real organic reaction from the guys being down in the caves, they call them. They looked like little kids.\u201d\nIn the scene, Chief tight end Travis Kelce, who earns around $17 million a year, commented on a check that dated back to 1961 for $48.50 \u2014 the amount a player got paid for one game. Adjusted for inflation, it\u2019s $521.44.\n\u201cBack then, that was like a million dollars though, right?\u201d he quipped."

The Chiefs made a name for themselves by defeating the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IV, becoming the second AFL team to triumph over an NFL team in the championship.\nIt would be several decades before the Chiefs returned to the Super Bowl stage. In the 2019 season, Patrick Mahomes led the team to victory, becoming the youngest quarterback to earn the Super Bowl MVP title. The Chiefs continued their success with two more Super Bowl wins in 2023 and 2024, bringing their total to four. The franchise has been home to numerous Hall of Fame players who have left a lasting mark on the NFL, including legends like Will Shields, Derrick Thomas, Len Dawson, and Bobby Bell.\nThe Chiefs play their home games at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. In recent years, the team has been bolstered by rising stars such as Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Creed Humphrey, and Rashee Rice. The Chiefs have gained additional attention following Taylor Swift's announcement of her relationship with tight end Travis Kelce, drawing her fans into the team's fan base.

For decades, they struggled to clinch a championship until the 1980s, when head coach Bill Walsh transformed the team into a dominant force.\nFounded in 1946 as a charter member of the All-America Football Conference, the 49ers initially couldn't surpass the powerhouse Cleveland Browns. They joined the NFL in 1950, achieving several playoff appearances and securing three consecutive NFC Western division titles in the early 1970s, yet a championship remained elusive. The tide turned with new ownership in 1977, which brought in the legendary Bill Walsh. Under his leadership, the 49ers claimed their first Super Bowl victory in 1981, followed by two more titles in 1984 and 1988. Since 1981, the team has won the Super Bowl five times and been NFC champions eight times.\nThe 49ers have been home to iconic players such as Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott, and Steve Young. As of 2025, the roster features top players like Trent Williams, Christian McCaffrey, and Brock Purdy."

He will also have his driver's license suspended for a year, be required to continue AA courses and will have a breathalyzer ignition device installed in his car.\nHe was pulled over by police on Feb. 24 and a breathalyzer test resulted in him submitting blood with an alcohol content of 0.23. He was arrested that day, then pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated on Aug. 27 in Texas. He has been criminally charged with DWI on three occasions, with his two prior charges occurring Sept. 12, 2008, in South Dakota and on Feb. 26, 2019, in Smith County, Texas.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\nNow the NFL quarterback's father is hopeful that he can continue to go to his son's games this season, but couldn't say whether he would be able to leave his county in Texas to travel to Chiefs games.\n\"It\u2019s kind of a tradition; I normally go to all the football games. I know he enjoys me being there, so hopefully things will work out and I\u2019ll be able to continue what I\u2019ve been doing,\" Mahomes said in an interview after sentencing. \"Hopefully it will enlighten someone else to take these measures and make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\"\nMahomes Sr. was a pro athlete himself, as a pitcher for six different MLB teams from 1992-2003. He was famously part of the 2000 New York Mets that reached the World Series.\nHis sentencing comes shortly after Mahomes' mother, Randi Mahomes, made multiple social media posts indicating that her father, the quarterback's grandfather, was hospitalized.\n\"Prayer warriors please pray for my daddy. He is in the hospital and is not well His name is Randy,\" she wrote on X on Sept. 14.\nThen, on Sunday, ahead of the Chiefs' win over the Atlanta Falcons, Randi posted an Instagram story that read, \"This is how I fight my battles. If you are seeing this, take a moment, and PRAY for my dad now.\"\nMahomes Sr. is also not the first member of the quarterback's immediate family to face legal trouble. In March, Mahomes' little brother, Jackson Mahomes, was sentenced to six months of probation after pleading no contest to a sexual battery charge. Mahomes was arrested and charged in May 2023 with three counts of aggravated sexual battery and one of battery by the Johnson County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\nNow, Mahomes the quarterback must deal with the latest string of unfortunate dramatic occurrences in his personal life, all while trying to lead the Chiefs to an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl and preparing for his third child with wife Brittany.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nTo make matters worse, Brittany was also recently verbally attacked on an episode of \"The View\" by host Sunny Hostin, who criticized Mahomes' wife and their marriage after Brittany was linked to Instagram activity showing support to former president Trump.\n\"It just seems to me that since she is in an interracial marriage, she should have known that to support a racist is problematic, her children are biracial and her family is one of the families, that in the \u201970s could not have lived in any of Donald Trump\u2019s buildings,\" Hostin said.\nMahomes has managed to lead his team to a perfect 3-0 start so far this season after a 22-17 win over the Falcons on Sunday. But, individually, he has shown signs of struggle. Mahomes, who has a history of ranking at or near the top of the league in passing stats every year, currently ranks at 20th among all quarterbacks.\nFollow Fox News Digital\u2019s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter."
