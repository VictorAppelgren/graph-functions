  "content": "A 19-year-old US sailor has been declared lost at sea after he was assumed to have gone overboard the USS George Washington off the coast of Australia.\n\nJose Antonio Rivera Lynch IV was identified as the missing sailor by the Navy on Aug. 1.\n\nRivera Lynch served as an Aviation Boatswain\u2019s Mate (Launch/Recovery Equipment) Airman onboard the aircraft carrier and went missing on July 28, only hours after a \u201cpositive\u201d phone call with his parents.\n\n\u201cAt just 19 years old, Jose faithfully served his country with honor, courage, and an unwavering commitment to protecting others,\u201d his family revealed in a GoFundMe.\n\n\u201cJose was more than a sailor \u2014 he was a loving son, a cherished brother, and a loyal friend whose laughter and light touched everyone around him. His sudden loss has left our family heartbroken and navigating the unimaginable grief of losing someone so young and full of promise,\u201d the family added.\n\nA search and rescue operation was launched for the missing sailor and included several Naval vessels and was assisted by the Australian Defense and Australian Border Forces.\n\nOfficials called off the search that lasted 45 hours and spanned an area of roughly 2,200 square miles on July 30, the Navy announced.\n\nThe Nimitz-class nuclear-powered aircraft was navigating the Timor Sea north of Australia when Rivera Lynch was reported missing.\n\nRivera Lynch had spoken with his parents just 12 hours beforehand, at around 10 a.m., and expressed how tired he had become due to his long workdays.\n\n\u201cWe noticed the tiredness, we noticed that, and then he said, \u2018I love you guys,\u2019 \u201d the sailor\u2019s father Juan Antonio Rivera III told News4Jax. \u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019re the best of me. You\u2019ve been to places I\u2019ve never been and we are so proud of you.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat was the last thing I said to my son,\u201d the heartbroken father said.\n\nRivera Lynch came from a long line of military service, following in the footsteps of his sister, father and grandfather.\n\n\u201cHe is my hero,\u201d Rivera said.\n\nThe Middleburg, Florida, native enlisted in the military as a 17-year-old in high school, as part of the Navy\u2019s delayed enlistment program, before joining in June 2024.\n\nHe was assigned to the aircraft carrier when it was stationed at its homeport of Yokosuka, Japan, in January.\n\nThe mourning father remembered his son for his service and personality.\n\n\u201cHe was vibrant, educated, humble. He served his country, he served the Navy and he has made his family proud,\u201d he said.\n\nRivera Lynch\u2019s family held a memorial earlier this month and he will be honored during a funeral and memorial service by the Navy on Sept. 19, in Yokosuka, Japan.\n\n\u201cOur thoughts and prayers remain with Airman Rivera Lynch\u2019s family, friends, and shipmates during this incredibly difficult time,\u201d Carrier Strike Group 5 Commander Rear Adm. Eric Anduze, said according to USNI News.\n\n\u201cThe courage and dedication shown by all personnel involved in this operation exemplifies the professionalism and commitment that defines our Navy.\u201d",

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21. Terms Pertaining to Certain Third Party Content, Data and Information Providers and Mobile Application Platforms.\n21.1 AP Material. By accessing the Services, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, video and/or audio material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (ii) No Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (iii) The Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (iv) The Associated Press is an intended third party beneficiary of these terms and conditions and it may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (v) The Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of AP materials or any portion thereof at any time.\n21.2 Mobile Applications.

      "text": "Warning graphic content\nWild daylight brawl breaks out among swimsuit-clad boaters at Florida lake in front of families, kids: video\nA wild brawl broke out among a group of swimsuit-clad boaters at a Florida lake over the weekend \u2014 in which one man was knocked unconscious and left floating face down in the water, shocking video shows.\nThe unruly fight happened at Lake Winterset in Polk County, in front of young children relaxing on the lakeside with their families, the Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office said.\nSeven men and a 17-year-old boy were arrested, Sheriff Grady Judd announced Tuesday, as he vowed to make an example out of the hooligans.\nThe dramatic footage starts when one of the men is slugged twice by another before he flops to the ground and appears to be unconscious. Once he went face down, the others started swinging.\nPunches fly seemingly at random as a woman in a pink bikini attempts CPR on the knocked-out man, the clip played by the sheriff shows.\nThe chaos stilled for a moment as one of the taller men wearing a gigantic gold chain tried to hold back another man who thrashed wildly in his arms.\nThe two tripped over a ledge and into the lake before the man who threw the first punch dove in out of nowhere and started walloping another man, who was also knocked unconscious face down in the lake.\nMason Land, Nate Land, Payton Ely, Timothy Gooding, Richard Carden, Garrett Ore, Garrett Hiltabidel and an unidentified 17-year-old have since been arrested for the violence and all face charges for rioting, affray, trespassing and disorderly conduct, according to the sheriff\u2019s office.\nAll of the men were in their late teens and early 20s, except for Carden, who is 40 years old.\nThe fed-up sheriff promised an unflinching crackdown on delinquency throughout the county, specifically on properties like the Winterset sandbar.\n\u201cYou can knucklebust and create brain injuries to each other on your own property without creating a disturbance to your neighbors. It\u2019s over, folks. I think I\u2019ve said that enough,\u201d Judd said.\n\u201cThe conduct is reprehensible and, obviously, you don\u2019t believe us when we try to warn you. So you have unleashed the teeth of the dog, and now we\u2019re going to start biting you, just like we bit these guys here.\u201d\nRabble-rousing young people tend to crop up near the Winterset sandbar for all types of criminality, including public displays of indecency and sexual activity captured by neighboring property owners, the sheriff said.\nIn May, the Polk County Commission passed an ordinance that would keep boaters away from the shoreline at specific lakes, including the sandbar on Lake Winterset. It has just reached the final stages of state approval by early August, Judd said, but it hasn\u2019t gone into effect yet.\nIn the wake of the fight, Judd added that the sheriff\u2019s office will be meeting with the county attorneys to explore imposing an extra noise ordinance at the lake.\nLake Winterset is just 2 miles away from LEGOLAND Florida, a theme park resort based on the popular children\u2019s toy."

      "text": "NYC designer Martha Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s tragic death on Montauk boat eyed as suspected accidental drug overdose: sources\nThe mysterious death of Manhattan swimwear designer Martha Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra at the upscale Montauk Yacht Club is being eyed as a possible accidental overdose, sources said Tuesday.\nThe 33-year-old Irish beauty was found unconscious at the ritzy club at around midnight on Aug. 5 aboard a boat named \u201cRipple\u201d \u2013 one of at least two Grateful Dead-themed crafts owned by insurance mogul Christopher Durnan, sources tell The Post.\nAn autopsy is pending to determine Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s official cause of death \u2013 although sources said it was a suspected drug overdose.\nQuestions have been swirling since the tragic night when Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra was discovered on the \u201cRipple,\u201d which was docked at the Yacht Club. Members reported hearing screams and called 911, before trying to resuscitate the young designer \u2013 who was later pronounced dead.\nThe good Samaritans told The Post they were woken by a naked man throwing sunscreen at their boat and saw him running down the dock screaming, \u201cDo something!\u201d\nDurnan, 60, a familiar figure at the club, owns the Durnan Group in Rockville Centre, which manages the \u201clargest, most successful Workers Compensation Safety Group for Real Estate\u201d on the company\u2019s website.\nHe owns \u201cRipple\u201d and a second boat, \u201cHell in a Bucket,\u201d which was docked alongside and is also a shout-out to the Grateful Dead, several club members confirmed.\nDurnan did not return several requests for comment.\nSuffolk County cops have not filed charges or identified any suspects in the case. But authorities have also not publicly ruled out foul play, despite revealing that there was no evidence of violence to the body.\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s death is also being investigated by Suffolk County\u2019s East End Drug Task Force, according to a Tuesday report by Newsday.\n\u201cUntil you start ruling stuff out, everything is in play,\u201d a source familiar with the investigation told the outlet.\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra, a native of the tiny Irish town of Carlow, migrated to the US, where she started as a bottle service girl in SoHo before co-founding East x East, a swimwear label.\n\u201cI always knew I wanted to be successful, that I was money-driven, business-driven, and that fashion is a tough industry and it would be a slow road,\u201d she told the Irish Independent last year.\nHer partner in the East x East, Dylan Grace, posted a moving tribute on Instagram following her death.\n\u201cWe dreamed big together, laughed harder than anyone else could understand and built so much from nothing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m truly blessed and grateful to have had you in my life.\u201d\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra summered in the Hamptons, where she hosted successful pop-up shows and fashion exhibits for wealthy clientele in Montauk and the surrounding area.\nShe had finalized her divorce to ex-Sam Ryan just months before her death, according to court records reviewed by The Post.\n\u201cI represented Mr. Ryan in a matrimonial proceeding. The final papers had been submitted to the court, and before the Judgment of Divorce was issued, I became aware of Ms. Nolan-O\u2019slatarra\u2019s passing and promptly notified the court,\u201d his attorney, David Centeno, said in a statement. \u201cOut of respect for the privacy of those involved and my ethical restraints, I cannot discuss whether there was a prenuptial agreement, mediation, or other private arrangements.\u201d\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s heartbroken mother, Elma Nolan, told the Irish Independent on Aug. 7 that her daughter was planning a trip home to Carlow before her death.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to my daughter,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cI feel numb and in shock.\u201d\n\u2014 Additional reporting by Brandon Cruz, Joe Marino and Peter Senzamici"

      "text": "Bryan Kohberger whines about being kept up at night by \u2018relentless\u2019 inmate taunts at maximum security lockup: report\nConvicted killer Bryan Kohberger has whined that he\u2019s \u201cextremely annoyed\u201d and losing sleep at the maximum security prison he now calls home \u2014 thanks to fellow inmates who constantly yell through vents into his cell in a \u201crelentless\u201d taunting campaign, according to a report.\nKohberger, who was hit with four life sentences last month for slaying four University of Idaho students, was transferred from jail to the only maximum security prison in the state and is now being held there in solitary confinement.\nAnd the prisoners at Kohberger\u2019s new digs at Idaho Maximum Security Institution in Kuna have had it out for the convicted criminology student \u2014 taking turns shouting into the vent that leads into his cell most hours of the day, a law enforcement source told the Daily Mail.\nKohberger, 28, has made multiple complaints to prison guards that he\u2019s been unable to sleep, according to Chris McDonough, a retired homicide detective who works for the Cold Case Foundation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s driving him crazy,\u201d McDonough told the outlet. \u201cThe inmates are tormenting him at night and almost all hours of the day \u2014 taunting him through the vents in his cell.\u201d\n\u201cThey are literally getting up into the grate and yelling at him. The inmates are taking turns doing it. It\u2019s relentless,\u201d McDonough continued. \u201cHe\u2019s extremely annoyed and frustrated. He\u2019s complaining to the authorities that he can\u2019t sleep because of them.\u201d\nKohberger is being housed in the prison\u2019s restricted unit in the facility\u2019s J block, away from the general prison population.\nHe\u2019s kept in a cell by himself at all times, except for one-hour a day when he\u2019s let into \u201cthe cage\u201d outside for recreation, while he wears restraints. And he\u2019s only allotted one shower every other day.\nThe high-profile nature of Kohberger\u2019s case and the fact he copped to such abhorrent crimes makes him a target for other inmates who would want to harm him \u201cjust to make a name for themselves,\u201d McDonough explained.\nAnd since the other inmates don\u2019t pose a physical threat to Kohberger while he\u2019s in solitary, prison staff aren\u2019t likely to intervene, the former cop said.\nStill, as attention moves away from Kohberger over time, prison staff may eventually be willing to move him back to the general population, McDonough explained.\nAt the jail that Kohberger was previously kept in while he awaited trial, other defendants said he did unusual things like spending hours on the phone with his mom MaryAnn, washing his hands compulsively, taking showers upwards of an hour long and staying awake at night only to nap during the day.\nOnce, he confronted another defendant who yelled \u201cyou suck\u201d at a sports player on the TV because he thought the man was insulting Kohberger and his mom as they spoke on the phone.\nLast month, Kohberger took a surprise plea deal just weeks before his highly anticipated trial was set to kick off. The deal saw him skirt the possibility of facing the death penalty, enraging some of the families of his victims and leaving loved ones with no explanation for why he committed the heinous murders.\nHe admitted to killing Xana Kernodle, Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, and Ethan Chapin on Nov. 13, 2022 in their off-campus house in Moscow."

      "text": "MIDDLEBURG, Fla. \u2013 The father of a U.S. Navy Sailor from Middleburg who went missing while serving on the USS George Washington (CVN-73) talked about memories and the unbreakable bond with his son.\nThe military said it believes Jose Antonio Rivera Lynch IV had gone overboard off the coast of Australia.\nWhen Jose Antonio Rivera III talks about his son, his face immediately lights up.\n\u201cHe is my hero,\u201d Rivera III said.\nRivera Lynch IV is his father\u2019s youngest child, and holds the name of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather.\nWhen Rivera III got the call about his 19-year-old son, he didn\u2019t expect the worst, then things changed.\nWhen I drove around, I see the car, I immediately started having thoughts,\" Rivera III said. \u201cThe moment the door opened and I saw the chaplain, my universe just exploded.\u201d\nOn July 28, a possible sailor overboard was reported. Forty-eight hours later, Rivera Lynch IV had not been found and was presumed dead. Just 12 hours before, his son went missing; they had talked. His father recalled his son was tired from the long shifts, but excited for the journey.\n\u201cWe noticed the tiredness, we noticed that, and then he said, \u2018I love you guys,\u2019 Rivera III said. I said, \u2018You\u2019re the best of me. You\u2019ve been to places I\u2019ve never been and we are so proud of you.\u2019 That was the last thing I said to my son.\u201d\nRivera Lynch IV\u2019s military journey began at Ridgeview High School in its ROTC program. He also came from a family of military service members, including his dad. Rivera Lynch enlisted in the United States Navy at 17 years old.\nRivera said goodbye to his son with a memorial at the beginning of August. But his memory remains alive in his father\u2019s mind like their beloved trust walks since he was a little boy.\n\u201cWe would look at the stars and we would talk about many things, so whenever I had a stressful moment, he would grab me by the hand and say, \u2018Dad let\u2019s go for a trust walk,\u2019\u201d Rivera said.\n\u201cThat is what built the relationship, there was trust [and] openness, so it was not only dad, it was a friend. I [have] so much to tell you and that remained until the last moment we talked,\u201d said Rivera.\nA father and son bond that will live forever.\nAnd in his short life of 19 years, Rivera Lynch IV has made an impact forever. A question remains. Where is his son?\n\u201cHe was vibrant, educated, humble. He served his country, he served the navy and he has made his family proud,\u201d Rivera III said.\nThe ceremony for Rivera Lynch IV will be held Sept. 19 in Yokuska, Japan. He will be honored by the Navy in Japan, where he was deployed.\nHis family has created a GoFundMe to pay for traveling expenses."
