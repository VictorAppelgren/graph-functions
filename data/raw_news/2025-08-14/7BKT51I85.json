  "title": "Israel is in talks to possibly resettle Palestinians from Gaza in South Sudan",
  "description": "Israel is in discussions with South Sudan about the possibility of resettling Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to the war-torn East African country, part of a wider effort by Israel to facilitate mass emigration from the territory left in ruins by its 22-month offensive against Hamas.",
  "content": "Israel is in discussions with South Sudan about the possibility of resettling Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to the war-torn East African country, part of a wider effort by Israel to facilitate mass emigration from the territory left in ruins by its 22-month offensive against Hamas.\n\nSix people familiar with the matter confirmed the talks to The Associated Press. It\u2019s unclear how far the talks have advanced, but if implemented, the plans would amount to transferring people from one war-ravaged land at risk of famine to another, and raise human rights concerns.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he wants to realize US President Donald Trump\u2019s vision of relocating much of Gaza\u2019s population through what Netanyahu refers to as \u201cvoluntary migration.\u201d Israel has floated similar resettlement proposals with other African nations.\n\n\u201cI think that the right thing to do, even according to the laws of war as I know them, is to allow the population to leave, and then you go in with all your might against the enemy who remains there,\u201d Netanyahu said Tuesday in an interview with i24, and Israeli TV station. He did not make reference to South Sudan.\n\nPalestinians, rights groups, and much of the international community have rejected the proposals as a blueprint for forcible expulsion in violation of international law.\n\nFor South Sudan, such a deal could help it build closer ties to Israel, now the almost unchallenged military power in the Middle East. It is also a potential inroad to Trump, who broached the idea of resettling Gaza\u2019s population in February but appears to have backed away in recent months.\n\nIsrael\u2019s foreign ministry declined to comment and South Sudan\u2019s foreign minister did not respond to questions about the talks. A US State Department spokesperson said it doesn\u2019t comment on private diplomatic conversations.\n\nEgypt opposes proposals to resettle Palestinians out of Gaza\n\nJoe Szlavik, the founder of a US lobbying firm working with South Sudan, said he was briefed by South Sudanese officials on the talks. He said an Israeli delegation plans to visit the country to look into the possibility of setting up camps for Palestinians there. No known date has been set for the visit. Israel did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation of the visit.\n\nSzlavik said Israel would likely pay for makeshift camps.\n\nEdmund Yakani, who heads a South Sudanese civil society group, said he had also spoken to South Sudanese officials about the talks. Four additional officials with knowledge of the discussions confirmed talks were taking place on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss them publicly.\n\nTwo of the officials, both from Egypt, told AP they\u2019ve known for months about Israel\u2019s efforts to find a country to accept Palestinians, including its contact with South Sudan. They said they\u2019ve been lobbying South Sudan against taking the Palestinians.\n\nEgypt is deeply opposed to plans to transfer Palestinians out of Gaza, with which it shares a border, fearing an influx of refugees into its own territory.\n\nThe AP previously reported on similar talks initiated by Israel and the US with Sudan and Somalia, countries that are also grappling with war and hunger, and the breakaway region of Somalia known as Somaliland. The status of those discussions is not known.\n\nSzlavik, who\u2019s been hired by South Sudan to improve its relations with the United States, said the US is aware of the discussions with Israel but is not directly involved.\n\nSouth Sudan wants the Trump administration to lift a travel ban on the country and remove sanctions from some South Sudanese elites, said Szlavik. It has already accepted eight individuals swept up in the administration\u2019s mass deportations, in what may have been an effort to curry favor.\n\nThe Trump administration has pressured a number of countries to help facilitate deportations.\n\n\u201cCash-strapped South Sudan needs any ally, financial gain and diplomatic security it can get,\u201d said Peter Martell, a journalist and author of a book about the country, \u201cFirst Raise a Flag.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s Mossad spy agency provided aid to the South Sudanese during their decades-long civil war against the Arab-dominated government in Khartoum ahead of independence in 2011, according to the book.\n\nThe State Department, asked if there was any quid pro quo with South Sudan, said decisions on the issuing of visas are made \u201cin a way that prioritizes upholding the highest standards for US national security, public safety, and the enforcement of our immigration laws.\u201d\n\nFrom one hunger-stricken conflict zone to another\n\nMany Palestinians might want to leave Gaza, at least temporarily, to escape the war and a hunger crisis bordering on famine. But they have roundly rejected any permanent resettlement from what they see as an integral part of their national homeland.\n\nThey fear that Israel will never allow them to return, and that a mass departure would allow it to annex Gaza and reestablish Jewish settlements there, as called for by far-right ministers in the Israeli government.\n\nStill, even those Palestinians who want to leave are unlikely to take their chances in South Sudan, among the world\u2019s most unstable and conflict-ridden countries.\n\nSouth Sudan has struggled to recover from a civil war that broke out after independence, and which killed nearly 400,000 people and plunged pockets of the country into famine. The oil-rich country is plagued by corruption and relies on international aid to help feed its 11 million people \u2013 a challenge that has only grown since the Trump administration made sweeping cuts to foreign assistance.\n\nA peace deal reached seven years ago has been fragile and incomplete, and the threat of war returned when the main opposition leader was placed under house arrest this year.\n\nPalestinians in particular could find themselves unwelcome. The long war for independence from Sudan pitted the mostly Christian and animist south against the predominantly Arab and Muslim north.\n\nYakani, of the civil society group, said South Sudanese would need to know who is coming and how long they plan to stay, or there could be hostilities due to the \u201chistorical issues with Muslims and Arabs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSouth Sudan should not become a dumping ground for people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it should not accept to take people as negotiating chips to improve relations.\u201d",

      "text": "Thousands of activists from around the world are expected to descend on Egypt on Thursday for a \u201cGlobal March to Gaza,\u201d a movement aiming to break the Israeli blockade that has pushed the territory to the brink of famine.\nSome 4,000 volunteers from over 80 countries will join the protest, according to organizers. They will land in Cairo, take buses to the city of Arish in northern Sinai, and then march around 30 miles through the desert peninsula to the Egyptian side of the Gaza border at Rafah. Organizers told CNN the activists will sleep in tents along the route and are expected to arrive at the border on Friday but do not plan to enter the war-ravaged enclave.\nThe march puts Egypt in an awkward position as it tries to balance its ties with Israel and the United States against its public condemnation of the war\u2019s brutal toll on Gaza\u2019s civilians. A key mediator with direct channels to both Hamas and Israel, Cairo has been wary of the conflict spilling over into its territory. It has kept its side of the Rafah crossing closed to Palestinians, even as anger at Israel\u2019s actions continues to rise at home.\nIn a statement Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said he expects the Egyptian government \u201cto prevent the arrival of jihadist demonstrators to the border of Egypt-Israel and not to allow them to carry out provocations and to try to enter into Gaza.\u201d\nThis will \u201cendanger the security of IDF (Israel Defense Forces) soldiers and we will not allow it,\u201d Katz added.\nThe international activists will be joined by another convoy of 2,000 protesters arriving from Tunisia. That group arrived in Libya, which neighbors Egypt, on Wednesday, organizers said.\nAmong those joining the march are Nkosi Zwelivelile Mandela, a former South African lawmaker and grandson of Nelson Mandela, and Hala Rharrit, a former US State Department diplomat who resigned from her US government position during the Biden administration over Washington\u2019s handling of the Gaza war.\n\u201cThis is just another tool, another way (for) the people to raise their voices, to let governments know that we are not happy,\u201d Uzma Usmani, the sponsorship and logistics lead for the UK delegation of the march, told CNN. \u201cWe need to take things into our own hands, to raise awareness, to put pressure on all the different governments so that they start taking action,\u201d she said.\nAs Israel\u2019s war in Gaza enters its 21st month, high-profile international campaigners are becoming increasingly active in their attempt to break the siege.\nOn Monday, Israel intercepted a Gaza-bound aid ship, the \u201cMadleen,\u201d detaining its passengers and taking them to Israel.\nAmong the activists on board was Swedish climate and human rights activist Greta Thunberg and French member of the European Parliament Rima Hassan.\nIsrael imposed a full humanitarian blockade of Gaza on March 2, cutting off food, medical supplies and other aid to the more than 2 million Palestinians in the territory for 11 weeks.\nFaced with growing international pressure, it began allowing a trickle of aid in late May. But humanitarian organizations say it is only a fraction of the aid that entered the enclave before the war.\nOrganizers of the Global March to Gaza have said that they have reached out to Egyptian authorities, informing them of their plans and asking for cooperation and protection but have received no response.\nThe Egyptian foreign ministry said in a statement that activists must obtain permits ahead of their arrival in Cairo.\n\u201cEgypt stresses the importance of adhering to these established regulatory measures to ensure the safety of visiting delegations due to the sensitive security conditions in this border area since the onset of the crisis in Gaza,\u201d the ministry said, adding that \u201cthat no requests or invitations will be considered or responded to if submitted outside the framework specified by the regulatory provisions.\u201d\nOrganizers said they followed \u201call the required protocols detailed in this statement.\u201d\nThey told CNN on Wednesday that some activists have experienced harassment and been detained upon arriving in the Egyptian capital, saying they fear deportation.\nOn Thursday, organizers said 170 people are currently facing delays and deportations at Cairo airport, but that thousands of participants are already in Egypt and are determined to continue their march.\nCNN has reached out to the Egyptian foreign media press center and the foreign ministry for comment on those allegations.\nIn a video shared with CNN by the march\u2019s Canadian delegation, a large number of Egyptian authorities are seen standing on the tarmac as the Canadian activists disembark a plane. One man can be seen holding a scarf with the Palestinian flag, and in another video, activists can be heard chanting \u201cfree Palestine.\u201d\nRharrit, the former State Department official, told CNN: \u201cChildren are starving to death, and at this point, the only thing I feel I can do is action.\u201d\n\u201cNow is no longer the time for talk only. We need action, and we saw that with the (\u201cMadleen\u201d) flotilla,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson this week. \u201cThis is humanity saying no more, let the food in.\u201d\nEgyptian authorities \u201chave no reason not to support this march,\u201d Rharrit said, adding that delegations across the world had informed Egyptian embassies of their plan well ahead of time.\n\u201cThere have been meetings with Egyptian ambassadors. Egyptian authorities have not said no,\u201d she said, adding that the march is \u201cin line with everything Egypt has been trying to do diplomatically.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Oren Liebermann contributed reporting. This story has been updated with additional developments."
