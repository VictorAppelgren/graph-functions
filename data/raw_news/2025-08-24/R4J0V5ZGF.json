  "title": "Jury orders Elon Musk's Tesla to pay massive sum for fatal crash allegedly caused by Autopilot: 'Will send shock waves to others in the industry'",
  "description": "\"This will open the floodgates.\"",
  "content": "A federal jury has determined that Tesla \"bore significant responsibility\" for a deadly crash in Florida involving Autopilot, an advanced driver assist system intended to reduce driver workload and traffic collisions, as reported by the Associated Press.\n\nThe ruling comes as Tesla grapples with lagging sales, declining revenue, volatile stocks, damaged brand trust, and eroding consumer loyalty, with CEO Elon Musk's polarizing politics and public disputes playing a role in these struggles.\n\nA Miami jury ordered Tesla to pay more than $240 million to the victims of a 2019 crash that killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and seriously injured her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo.\n\nAccording to the AP, the jury ruled that because its Autopilot failed, Tesla was partially responsible for the crash even though driver George McGee was distracted by his cellphone.\n\nBrett Schreiber, the plaintiffs' lead attorney, argued that Tesla misleads drivers to believe its Autopilot is more capable of handling road situations than it is because other automakers use terms like \"driver assist\" and \"copilot\" to prevent overreliance on similar technologies.\n\n\"Words matter,\" Schreiber said. \"And if someone is playing fast and loose with words, they're playing fast and loose with information and facts.\"\n\nWhy is this news worrying for Tesla?\n\nTeslas are generally among the safest cars around and offer long-term environmental perks and cost savings on energy and maintenance, like other electric vehicles.\n\nHowever, like any vehicle, they aren't perfect. The jury's verdict could further erode consumer trust in the brand at a time when Tesla is pivoting to AI and robotics to boost profitability.\n\nAlready, Tesla's fight to keep crash data involving its Autopilot and Full-Self Driving systems private has raised eyebrows.\n\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has also opened multiple investigations into the automaker after crashes involving several of its autonomous features.\n\nIn the latest case, the families of Leon and Angulo alleged Tesla lost or hid crucial evidence \u2014 a claim Tesla disputed as an honest mistake after evidence came to light, according to the AP.\n\nWhile similar cases against Tesla have previously been dismissed or settled out of court, the jury's $240 million verdict could set a precedent.",

      "text": "Jury orders Tesla to pay more than $240 million in Autopilot crash case\nJury orders Tesla to pay more than $240 million in Autopilot crash case\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 A Miami jury decided that Elon Musk\u2019s car company Tesla was partly responsible for a deadly crash in Florida involving its Autopilot driver assist technology and must pay the victims more than $240 million in damages.\nThe federal jury held that Tesla bore significant responsibility because its technology failed and that not all the blame can be put on a reckless driver, even one who admitted he was distracted by his cellphone before hitting a young couple out gazing at the stars. The decision comes as Musk seeks to convince Americans his cars are safe enough to drive on their own as he plans to roll out a driverless taxi service in several cities in the coming months.\nThe decision ends a four-year long case remarkable not just in its outcome but that it even made it to trial. Many similar cases against Tesla have been dismissed and, when that didn\u2019t happen, settled by the company to avoid the spotlight of a trial.\n\u201cThis will open the floodgates,\u201d said Miguel Custodio, a car crash lawyer not involved in the Tesla case. \u201cIt will embolden a lot of people to come to court.\u201d\nThe case also included startling charges by lawyers for the family of the deceased, 22-year-old, Naibel Benavides Leon, and for her injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo. They claimed Tesla either hid or lost key evidence, including data and video recorded seconds before the accident. Tesla said it made a mistake after being shown the evidence and honestly hadn\u2019t thought it was there.\n\u201cWe finally learned what happened that night, that the car was actually defective,\u201d said Benavides\u2019 sister, Neima Benavides. \u201cJustice was achieved.\u201d\nTesla has previously faced criticism that it is slow to cough up crucial data by relatives of other victims in Tesla crashes, accusations that the car company has denied. In this case, the plaintiffs showed Tesla had the evidence all along, despite its repeated denials, by hiring a forensic data expert who dug it up.\n\u201cToday\u2019s verdict is wrong,\u201d Tesla said in a statement, \u201cand only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla\u2019s and the entire industry\u2019s efforts to develop and implement lifesaving technology,\u201d They said the plaintiffs concocted a story \u201dblaming the car when the driver \u2013 from day one \u2013 admitted and accepted responsibility.\u201d\nIn addition to a punitive award of $200 million, the jury said Tesla must also pay $43 million of a total $129 million in compensatory damages for the crash, bringing the total borne by the company to $243 million.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big number that will send shock waves to others in the industry,\u201d said financial analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good day for Tesla.\u201d\nTesla said it will appeal.\nEven if that fails, the company says it will end up paying far less than what the jury decided because of a pre-trial agreement that limits punitive damages to three times Tesla\u2019s compensatory damages. Translation: $172 million, not $243 million. But the plaintiff says their deal was based on a multiple of all compensatory damages, not just Tesla\u2019s, and the figure the jury awarded is the one the company will have to pay.\nIt\u2019s not clear how much of a hit to Tesla\u2019s reputation for safety the verdict in the Miami case will make. Tesla has vastly improved its technology since the crash on a dark, rural road in Key Largo, Florida, in 2019.\nBut the issue of trust generally in the company came up several times in the case, including in closing arguments Thursday. The plaintiffs\u2019 lead lawyer, Brett Schreiber, said Tesla\u2019s decision to even use the term Autopilot showed it was willing to mislead people and take big risks with their lives because the system only helps drivers with lane changes, slowing a car and other tasks, falling far short of driving the car itself.\nSchreiber said other automakers use terms like \u201cdriver assist\u201d and \u201ccopilot\u201d to make sure drivers don\u2019t rely too much on the technology.\n\u201cWords matter,\u201d Schreiber said. \u201cAnd if someone is playing fast and lose with words, they\u2019re playing fast and lose with information and facts.\u201d\nSchreiber acknowledged that the driver, George McGee, was negligent when he blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62 miles an hour before slamming into a Chevrolet Tahoe that the couple had parked to get a look at the stars.\nThe Tahoe spun around so hard it was able to launch Benavides 75 feet through the air into nearby woods where her body was later found. It also left Angulo, who walked into the courtroom Friday with a limp and cushion to sit on, with broken bones and a traumatic brain injury.\nBut Schreiber said Tesla was at fault nonetheless. He said Tesla allowed drivers to act recklessly by not disengaging the Autopilot as soon as they begin to show signs of distraction and by allowing them to use the system on smaller roads that it was not designed for, like the one McGee was driving on.\n\u201cI trusted the technology too much,\u201d said McGee at one point in his testimony. \u201cI believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.\u201d\nThe lead defense lawyer in the Miami case, Joel Smith, countered that Tesla warns drivers that they must keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel yet McGee chose not to do that while he looked for a dropped cellphone, adding to the danger by speeding. Noting that McGee had gone through the same intersection 30 or 40 times previously and hadn\u2019t crashed during any of those trips, Smith said that isolated the cause to one thing alone: \u201cThe cause is that he dropped his cellphone.\u201d\nThe auto industry has been watching the case closely because a finding of Tesla liability despite a driver\u2019s admission of reckless behavior would pose significant legal risks for every company as they develop cars that increasingly drive themselves.\n__\nCondon reported from New York.\n__\nEarlier versions of this story incorrectly reported that the jury ordered Tesla to pay $329 million and that the compensatory damages totaled $49 million."

The verdict cites failures in the technology and alleged concealment of evidence, while the driver was also distracted by a cellphone. The decision could damage Tesla\u2019s reputation for safety, set a legal precedent for future autonomous\u2011vehicle cases, and complicate the company\u2019s efforts to expand its driverless taxi service. Tesla plans to appeal, arguing the award exceeds limits set by a pre\u2011trial agreement.",
