  "description": "\"We live in completely separate realities, but you can't convince these people of our humanity.\"",
  "content": "\"Canadian here. I visited the US recently and took an Uber. I told the driver that I'm from Canada, and he asked me how we're taking the 51st state stuff. I said that Canadians are mad about it. He told me I\u2019m wrong because some folks in Alberta support it and would separate.\"\n\n\"In the late 1990s, I was clear to a conservative friend that I think Bill Clinton is a mostly terrible human, and I just voted for him because he did things politically that I liked. My conservative friend said she couldn't get past the sleaze. Now? She's skeptical that Trump has ever cheated on a spouse and is skeptical that he's even racist .\"\n\n\"The whole anti-vaccine movement in the global West, especially for diseases like measles. I grew up in a developing world country, where everyone \u2014 rich, poor, and destitute \u2014 clamored to get their kids vaccinated. Then I moved to Canada and heard parents say they won't get the measles vaccine for their kids while we're in the middle of an outbreak. Their stupidity is endangering the lives of their children.\"\n\n\"The whole United Healthcare CEO assassination showed a clear divide between the upper and lower classes. No matter the politics, the rich couldn\u2019t fathom why the middle and lower classes reacted the way we did. The media (controlled by the rich) was saying one thing ; meanwhile, social media (where the lower classes are given a platform) was saying something else . That time felt like I was in a dystopian novel.\"\n\n\"I'm trans, and most of my friends are trans. We get together and laugh and cry and have good times and bad. Some of us want to settle down with a house, wife, and kids. Others are extremely ambitious with their art and careers. But they're all good people. Then you speak to someone who's anti-trans, and they claim we're all groomers, rapists, pedophiles, mentally ill, mutilated, radicalized monsters. We live in completely separate realities, but you can't convince these people of our humanity.\"\n\n\"A couple of years ago, my wife and I went to California with some other people. One of those people had a very specific and negative opinion of California that came out every once in a while. We were on the boardwalk enjoying a beautiful day and taking in the art, but that guy was adamant about California's 'bums and crime' problem, even though we were perfectly fine. It was a very weird situation just trying (and failing) to get him to look around and see reality.\"\n\n\"I recently had a conversation with my dad about the flooding in Texas. He said, 'I don't understand how something like that could happen. Isn't the whole point of the weather service to warn people ahead of time? How did they miss something like that?' I replied, 'It's probably because Trump severely cut their budget and fired a ton of people.' He responded, 'I should have known you'd make this political.'\"",

The author reflects on the anti-vaccine movement, particularly in the global West, where parents are afraid to vaccinate their children during an outbreak of measles. She also reflects on a growing divide between the upper and lower classes, with the media seemingly controlled by the wealthy and social media expressing different viewpoints. The article also discusses the impact of the United Healthcare CEO assassination on the public health sector, with some arguing that the rich couldn't understand why the middle and lower class reacted differently. The book also discusses trans-identified individuals who believe that trans-identidentidentity is an issue, but can't convince them otherwise.",

      "text": "Elon Musk was visibly bursting with excitement after President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. At a celebratory rally on Monday at Capitol One Arena in Washington, he pumped his fist in the air and bellowed a \u201cYes!\u201d to the raucous crowd. But another gesture soon after has sent observers questioning whether Musk was expressing just joy, or something more insidious.\n\u201cI just want to say thank you for making it happen,\u201d the Tesla and SpaceX CEO and X owner told the audience of Trump supporters. Musk then slapped his chest with his right hand, before flinging it diagonally upwards, palm face down. He turned around to audience members behind the podium, and repeated the gesture. \u201cMy heart goes out to you,\u201d the 53-year-old billionaire said, palm back on his chest.\nBut the quick, salute-like movement drew attention as swiftly as it happened. In live commentary, CNN anchor Erin Burnett pointed the gesture out, and co-anchor Kasie Hunt noted, \u201cIt\u2019s not something that you typically see in American political rallies.\u201d\nSocial media swarmed with confusion\u2014and theories. \u201cWTF?? What did Elon Musk just do??\u201d one X user asked. Streamer and leftist political commentator Hasan Pike posted: \u201cdid elon musk just hit the roman salute at his inauguration speech?\u201d\nOther users immediately drew comparison to a Nazi salute popularly used by Adolf Hitler. Public broadcaster PBS shared the clip on social media and reported it as \u201cwhat appeared to be a fascist salute.\u201d Musician and environmental activist Bill Madden posted: \u201cIf giving the Nazi \u2018Sieg Heil\u2019 salute was an Olympic event like gymnastics, Elon Musk would\u2019ve received a perfect score of 10. Musk even nailed the facial expression. Seriously, Hitler would be jealous.\u201d\nRuth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University who self-identified as a \u201chistorian of fascism,\u201d posted on Bluesky: \u201cIt was a Nazi salute and a very belligerent one too.\u201d Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported the gesture as a \u201cRoman salute,\u201d and said it will \u201conly cause greater alarm among Jews who have expressed concern with the billionaire\u2019s proximity to Trump\u2019s inner circle while platforming views prominent with [the] far-right.\u201d\nRolling Stone magazine reported that neo-Nazis and right-wing extremists in America and abroad were \u201cabuzz\u201d after the gesture, citing celebratory captions of the clip from far-right figures such as \u201cIncredible things are happening already lmao\u201d and \u201cOk maybe woke really is dead.\u201d\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) posted on X that he \u201cnever imagined we would see the day when what appears to be a Heil Hitler salute would be made behind the Presidential seal. This abhorrent gesture has no place in our society and belongs in the darkest chapters of human history.\u201d\nWhile speaking on stage at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Switzerland, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was asked by a member of the press about his reaction to Musk\u2019s gesture, to which he responded: \u201cWe have freedom of speech in Europe and in Germany, everyone can say what he wants, even if he is a billionaire. What we do not accept is if this is supporting extreme right positions.\u201d (In Germany, performing the Nazi salute is illegal.)\nHowever, some others have come to Musk\u2019s defense.\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an organization whose mission is to combat antisemitism and which describes a \u201cHitler salute\u201d as one with an \u201coutstretched right arm with the palm down,\u201d posted on X shortly after the incident that the billionaire Trump mega-donor \u201cmade an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute,\u201d and that \u201call sides should give one another a bit of grace, perhaps even the benefit of the doubt, and take a breath.\u201d\nThe Trump Administration\n- Wall Street Is Losing Patience With Trump\n- The Hottest Job in DC: Helping Foreign Allies Make Sense of Trump\n- Is the U.S. Heading Into a Recession Under Trump? Here\u2019s What to Know\n- What Is Trump\u2019s \u2018Gold Card\u2019 Route to Citizenship and How Might It Work?\n- Trump Speaks Out on Recession Fears, Tariffs, and the U.S. Aid Given to \u2018Ungrateful\u2019 Zelensky\nEyal Yakoby, a University of Pennsylvania graduate who campaigned against antisemitism on college campuses, called it \u201ca stupid hand gesture\u201d in a post on X, adding: \u201cAnyone trying to portray him as a Nazi is intentionally misleading the public.\u201d\nAaron Astor, a history professor at Maryville College in Tennessee, posted: \u201cThis is a socially awkward autistic man\u2019s wave to the crowd where he says \u2018my heart goes out to you.\u2019\u201d (Musk has previously disclosed that he has Asperger\u2019s syndrome, also known as autism spectrum disorder.) Newsweek opinion editor Batya Ungar-Sargon offered a similar explanation, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t need to invent outrage.\u201d\nMusk has previously been criticized for allowing pro-Nazi accounts to flourish on his platform and for posting right-wing memes and seemingly supporting antisemitic conspiracy theories, which led to an exodus of advertisers from X in 2023, and for recently supporting Germany\u2019s far-right populist AfD party, whose leaders have made \u201cantisemitic, anti-Muslim and anti-democratic\u201d statements, according to the ADL.\nThe debate over Musk\u2019s latest move has added fuel to other ongoing feuds, too.\nProgressive firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) targeted the ADL, which has been accused by the left of turning a blind eye toward Trump and his allies, in a post on X, saying: \u201cJust to be clear, you are defending a Heil Hitler salute that was performed and repeated for emphasis and clarity. People can officially stop listening to you as any sort of reputable source of information now. You work for them. Thank you for making that crystal clear to all.\u201d\nStaunch Trump supporter Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), meanwhile, threatened PBS by saying she would call it to testify before the oversight subcommittee she chairs that is set to work with the newly-formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which Musk oversees. \u201cI look forward to PBS @NewsHour coming before my committee and explaining why lying and spreading propaganda to serve the Democrat party and attack Republicans is a good use of taxpayer funds,\u201d Greene posted.\nMusk did not directly address the controversy Monday night, though he replied to a number of posts on X about it\u2014thanking the ADL, mocking Ocasio-Cortez, and agreeing with a post that said: \u201cCan we please retire the calling people a Nazi thing? It didn\u2019t work during the election, it\u2019s not working now, it\u2019s tired, boring, and old material, you\u2019ve burned out its effect, people don\u2019t feel shocked by it anymore, the wolf has been cried too many times.\u201d\nMusk also reposted a video clip of his rally remarks that included the moment he made the questionable gesture, commenting: \u201cThe future is so exciting!!\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Musk posted, \u201cThe radical leftists are really upset that they had to take time out of their busy day praising Hamas to call me a Nazi.\u201d And on Thursday, he thanked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had posted that Musk was \u201cfalsely smeared\u201d and is a \u201cfriend of Israel.\u201d\nShortly after, Musk posted a series of Holocaust- and Nazi-themed puns\u2014\u201dSome people will Goebbels anything down! \u2026 Bet you did nazi that coming\u201d\u2014and, for that, he did end up earning the condemnation of the ADL. By Thursday night, he seemed exasperated, posting: \u201cIf I see one more damn Nazi salute in my feed, I\u2019m gonna lose my mind,\u201d before joking, as the owner of the platform: \u201cThis algorithm sucks!!\u201d\n\u2014Ayesha Javed/Davos contributed reporting.\nMore Must-Reads from TIME\n- Cybersecurity Experts Are Sounding the Alarm on DOGE\n- Meet the 2025 Women of the Year\n- The Harsh Truth About Disability Inclusion\n- Why Do More Young Adults Have Cancer?\n- Colman Domingo Leads With Radical Love\n- How to Get Better at Doing Things Alone\n- Michelle Zauner Stares Down the Darkness\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Q: Is there an ad in Craigslist to hire people to riot in L.A.?\nA: No, there has been no such ad on Craigslist. Some social media posts cited a Craigslist ad to falsely claim it showed that people protesting the immigration raids in Los Angeles were being paid for their actions. But a pair of podcasters told the Associated Press they placed the ad as a prank for their show, and it had nothing to do with the protests.\nFULL ANSWER\nAn unfounded claim that people protesting immigration raids in Southern California and elsewhere are being paid for their participation has spread on social media, with posts sharing screenshots of a short-lived Craigslist ad as evidence. The strangely worded ad seeking \u201cBRAVE MEN\u201d for well-paid but unspecified duties makes no mention of protests \u2014 and was actually a prank ad placed by podcasters.\nSeveral readers have asked us about the ad and the social media posts.\nThe posts were aimed at participants in protests that began June 6 in Los Angeles, where Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stepped up workplace raids and arrests of people in the U.S. illegally. The Trump administration has deployed National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles to support federal law enforcement and protect federal buildings during the demonstrations. The protests also have spread to other cities throughout the U.S.\nWithout providing evidence of his claim, President Donald Trump has called the protesters \u201cPaid Insurrectionists!\u201d and \u201cpaid troublemakers\u201d in Truth Social posts. Speaking to reporters on June 10, Trump said of the protesters, \u201cI believe many of them are paid,\u201d adding later, \u201cLet me tell you, when you watch these agitators break up concrete and hand it out to people as they stood on line to get it, these have to be paid troublemakers.\u201d\nSocial media users seized on a Craigslist ad posted June 5 in the Los Angeles area, and with similar language in Austin, to support the claim that the protesters had been hired. \u201cLooking for the toughest badasses in the city (los angeles),\u201d the ad said. \u201cSEEKING EXTREMELY TOUGH, BRAVE MEN FOR NEW CREW IM BUILDING,\u201d it read, but never mentioned participation in protests or demonstrations \u2014 or any specific activity at all. The ad offered $6,500 to $12,500 a week.\nOne Threads post was captioned: \u201cLA \u2018protests\u2019 Craigslist ad searching for members. Follow the money.\u201d The accompanying video, which was shared by conservative commentator David J Harris Jr. on Facebook, tied the ad to the anti-Trump protest group No Kings. Another post on X said, \u201cCraigslist ad hiring protesters in L.A.\u201d\nBut the ad, which was removed from Craigslist in Los Angeles and Austin on June 9 and 10, according to the fact-checking website Snopes, was not placed by anyone who was \u201chiring protesters.\u201d\nA Prank by Podcasters\nThe bogus ad was a prank placed by a pair of podcasters, Joey LaFleur and Logan Quiroz, the Associated Press reported on June 10. The ad was intended as part of their show, \u201cGoofcon1,\u201d and had nothing to do with the anti-ICE protests. \u201cI literally had no idea it was ever going to be connected to the riots. It was a really weird coincidence,\u201d LaFleur told the AP.\nOn June 6, the podcasters livestreamed their conversations with people who had answered the ad.\nThe No Kings organization had no ties to the Craigslist ad, contrary to some social media posts.\nThe No Kings \u201cAbout\u201d page says, \u201cNo Kings is a nationwide day of defiance. From city blocks to small towns, from courthouse steps to community parks, we\u2019re taking action to reject authoritarianism \u2014 and show the world what democracy looks like.\u201d The site mainly calls for protests around the country on June 14, the day of a military parade in Washington, D.C., marking the Army\u2019s 250th birthday and the president\u2019s 79th, but also provides dates for organizing sessions, \u201cmarshal training\u201d and other preparation for protest events.\nThe website includes a note at the bottom saying, \u201cA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.\u201d\nThe site does not mention financial support for the protests. There is a long list of partners listed on the website, but no information about any funding they might provide for the organization.\nWe reached out to the No Kings organization for comment on the social media posts and whether the organization funds protest activities, but did not receive a response. We also sought comment from Craigslist about the ads, but did not get a response.\nClaims that protesters are paid actors is a familiar social media refrain. Baseless claims that counterprotesters were recruited through a Craigslist ad circulated after the 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as we\u2019ve written. Similar false claims about paid participants spread online in 2020 during the social justice protests following the death of George Floyd.\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

      "text": "Misleading videos and images are mainstays of disinformation. By engaging with visual evidence under false pretenses \u2014 perhaps because it was stripped of context or tied to a misleading caption \u2014 viewers' perception of reality can be warped. And, when global conflicts or crises are unfolding, the consequences of such widespread, incorrect understandings could have disastrous effects.\nBelow are seven videos and images that circulated widely during the 2022 war in Ukraine.\nThey include footage from a military simulation video game that spread like digital wildfire because people mistakenly believed it showed Ukrainian and Russian forces fighting, as well as several posts that attempted to downplay the violence or convince people that Russia's attack on Ukraine was justified.\nThe videos and photos are ranked in no particular order.\nDid 'Crisis Actors' Make a Propaganda Video in Ukraine?\n\u274c No. Claims that photos or videos supposedly showed \"crisis actors,\" or people pretending to be in crisis in Ukraine, were part of a disinformation campaign that ultimately attempted to grow people's distrust of anyone who considered the war a serious matter. For example, the video below wasn't related to the 2022 conflict at all; it was years-old, behind-the-scenes footage from the set of a sci-fi adventure movie.\nDoes This Video Show a Ukrainian Tank Crashing Through a Russian Barrier in 2022?\n\u274c Nope. This video \u2014 which racked up millions of views on TikTok in February and March 2022 \u2014 was actually filmed in 2014 during the Battle of Mariupol, shortly after Russia annexed Crimea.\nDid Zelenskyy 'Troll' Putin Over a Supposedly Fake Video?\n\u2753 Unproven. This rumor stems from two video clips: one supposedly showing Russian President Vladimir Putin's hand passing through a mic, and the other showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy touching a similar mic and moving it to one side. However, the illusion of the \"ghost microphone\" was caused by a low-quality video (not the result of an elaborate hoax to fool viewers), and there wasn't enough evidence to definitely say why the video of Zelenskyy showed him touching his mic.\nIs This a Real Photo of Zelenskyy Holding a Swastika Jersey?\n\u274c Nope. The image in the middle is not a genuine photo of Ukraine's president, who is Jewish. Rather, it is part of a concerted effort by Russian propagandists to depict him as a Nazi in order to justify Russia's invasion of the country. Someone made the swastika image by altering an authentic photo of Zelenskyy holding the jersey of the national team of Ukraine ahead of Euro 2020.\nIs This a Genuine Photo of Strollers that People Left in a Train Station in Poland To Help Ukrainian Refugees?\n\u2705 Yes. This photograph was taken by Francesco Malavolta, a photojournalist covering the conflict in Ukraine. He shared the photo on Twitter along with an Italian-language caption that translates to \"Strollers left at the station for women arriving from Ukraine with babies.\"\nDoes This Video Really Show Russian and Ukrainian Forces Exchanging Gunfire?\n\u274c Nope. Rather, this video was from a military simulation video game called ArmA3.\nIs This a Real News Report on Russia's Invasion of Ukraine?\n\u274c Not at all. This video that shows a reporter in front of dozens of body bags was actually taken in Austria on Feb. 4, 2022 (about two weeks before Russia's invasion of Ukraine), and it shows (living) environmental activists. Nevertheless, social media users shared the clip as if it was taken in Ukraine and showed a reporter talking about the war's death toll in front of actual casualties.\n\u2014 Snopes writers contributed to this report.\nSee also on Snopes:"

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nA Wall Street Journal article on Friday alleged that President Donald Trump cheated on his wife, Melania, with a porn star\u2014and it wasn't the first time Trump has been in the center of a public cheating scandal or experienced fallout over his behavior toward women.\nBelow is a look back at some of the most public cheating scandals Trump reportedly has been involved in.\nIvana Trump (1977-1992)\nTrump's first marriage imploded on the covers of all of New York's tabloids after he brazenly took his mistress, Marla Maples, on a family vacation in Aspen along with his wife, Ivana, and attempted to hide her away until she approached Ivana and said, \"I'm Marla and I love your husband. Do you?\"\nA famous issue of the New York Post in 1990 featured a quote from Maples plastered across its front page\u2014\"Best sex I ever had!\" referring to Donald\u2014while he was still married to Ivana. Trump famously pushed the story forward and called the tabloids to make sure his name stayed in the papers. At the time, he was a prominent New York real estate figure, but not known for much more than that.\nIn a recent memoir, titled Raising Trump, Ivana refers to the mistress as \"freaking Marla.\"\nMarla Maples (1993-1999)\nWhen Trump was dating his one-time mistress, Marla Maples, he famously posed as his own spokesman, \"John Miller,\" and told a People reporter that he'd never marry Maples, and that he had \"three other girlfriends\" at the time.\nMelania Trump (2005-present)\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Trump's lawyer had allegedly paid a porn star, Stephanie Clifford, over $130,000 for her silence about the alleged affair they had in 2006, one year after Trump married Melania.\nClifford, 38, goes by the name \"Stormy Daniels\" in the adult film industry, and said she had a sexual encounter with Trump at a celebrity golf tournament. Trump denied the allegations.\nRelated: Did Donald Trump Cheat on Melania?\nThe Wall Street Journal also reported on another alleged affair in November of 2016\u2014one in the same year, 2006, as the alleged affair with Clifford. The woman in that case was Karen McDougal, the 1998 Playmate of the Year. Trump's staff denied the allegations. The report focused on the agreement between McDougal and the National Enquirer, which paid her $150,000 for the story, and then never printed it.\nTrump's Alleged Sexual Harassment:\nNineteen women have come forward to accuse Trump of sexual harassment. The public allegations range from the 1980s to 2013, and they include former contestants on The Apprentice, an adult film star, a journalist at People Magazine, a journalist at Fox News and many others. Many of those incidents reportedly happened while Trump was married.\nAbout the writer\nMelina Delkic is a staff writer for Newsweek covering the guns and drugs beat."

      "text": "Fact check: 12 of 28 comments deemed racist on viral list are Trump's direct speech\nThe claim: Trump said these 28 racist things\nThroughout his presidency, Donald Trump has often been criticized for using or peddling racist language. A post on Instagram suggests those comments have piled up.\nThe post depicts a cartoon drawing of the president, who\u2019s saying, \u201cI\u2019m the least racist person in the room,\u201d a comment he made at the final presidential debate this month in Nashville. He\u2019s surrounded by speech bubbles of racist statements he reportedly made.\nOf the 28 listed comments, Trump said 12 of them as plainly stated. Two he said but lack context. Four comments are disputed, eight are paraphrased from similar statements and two he did not say.\nMore: Joe Biden calls Donald Trump 'one of the most racist presidents in modern history'\nThe person who drew and shared the post, Instagram user @heatherschiederillustrates_, said she sourced the comments from statements, tweets and interviews as they came through the news cycle. For her, Trump's presidency made the election personal.\n\"As a half Egyptian woman who was a conservative Catholic until the 2016 election cycle, I am have been worn down by this administration and their racism, xenophobia, sexism and utter mockery of real Christian values,\" she told USA TODAY. \"...For our own humanity and survival as a Nation, we need to vote him out.\"\nWhat Trump didn\u2019t say\nOn the list of 28 statements, two were decisively not said by Trump. Eight were paraphrased from similar comments the president made, but he did not say them explicitly.\n'White power'\nThere is no record of the president saying \u201cwhite power.\u201d He did come under fire in June for sharing a video to Twitter in which a Trump supporter was heard shouting those words at counter protesters. The tweet was deleted three hours after it was posted, the Washington Post reported.\n'Send her back'\nTrump also did not say \u201csend her back,\u201d in reference to Somali-born Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar. At a 2019 campaign rally in North Carolina, supporters in the crowd began to chant those words. There\u2019s no evidence Trump tried to stop the chants \u2013 although he says he did \u2013 but he never joined in. He later disavowed the language.\nAt a different point, he did post on Twitter that a group of \u201cprogressive Democrat congresswomen\u201d \u2014 most likely referring to Omar and other progressive colleagues often dubbed \u201cthe Squad\u201d \u2014 could \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\u201d\n'Where\u2019s his birth certificate?'\nThere's no record of Trump using this exact language. Still, he did question the authenticity of President Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate, raising questions of his place of birth and religion, before flipping in 2016 and saying he believes Obama was born in the U.S. \u201cWhy doesn't he show his birth certificate? There's something on that birth certificate that he doesn't like,\u201d Trump said on ABC's \"The View\" in 2011, according to CNN.\n'Dumb Don Lemon made LeBron look smart'\nThe president tweeted a comment similar to this in 2018 after CNN anchor Don Lemon interviewed NBA star LeBron James about a school he opened in Cleveland. However, Trump never called Lemon \"Dumb Don Lemon\" precisely. Here's what he said: \"LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made LeBron look smart, which isn\u2019t easy to do. I like Mike!\"\nIn the interview, Lemon asked James what he\u2019d say to Trump if he were sitting across from him, to which James responded he would never sit across from him. Lemon responded to Trump\u2019s tweet saying he \u201ctraffics in racism and is fueled by bullying.\u201d\n'My impeachment = lynching.'\nThe president described his impeachment probe as a \u201clynching\u201d in October 2019, the Washington Post reported. He did not say the two were \"equal.\"\n'Let\u2019s shoot migrants! I want an electric wall! A snake and alligator filled moat!'\nTrump did not say these phrases all at once, as the post presents them. But the New York Times reported in 2019 that he suggested each idea at some point in March of that year as a way to slow down immigration.\n'Suburban housewives: Low income housing will invade your neighborhood.'\nThe president tweeted a similar comment in August, conflating an increase in low income housing with a lack of safety. Here's what he said exactly: \"The 'suburban housewife' will be voting for me. They want safety & are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood.\"\n'Mexican rapists'\nTrump made a similar comment in 2015, when he announced that he was launching his presidential bid. \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026They\u2019re bringing drugs, they\u2019re bringing crime, they\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d\n'The 1619 Project is poison and child abuse.'\nTrump said that the New York Times\u2019 \"1619 Project\" is \u201cideological poison\u201d and that teaching it is \u201cform of child abuse in the truest sense of those words\u201d in September, according to White House records. Again, the post's language does not quote Trump directly.\n'Low IQ refugees'\nJust last week, another comment made by Trump made news as being racially insensitive. The post alleges Trump used the phrase \u201clow IQ refugees,\u201d but there\u2019s more to the story than that.\nDuring the immigration section of the presidential debate in Nashville, Trump criticized Democratic candidate Joe Biden over the Obama administration\u2019s catch and release policy.\n\u201cWhen you say they come back, they don\u2019t come back, Joe. They never come back,\u201d he said, according to USA TODAY's transcript. \u201cOnly the really \u2014 I hate to say this \u2014 but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back.\u201d Trump did not say all refugees are low IQ as the post insinuates.\nDisputed comments\nFor four of the comments listed on the post, there\u2019s not enough evidence to determine whether Trump really said them.\n'S---hole countries'\nDuring immigration talks in the Oval Office in 2018, Trump reportedly resorted to using crude descriptors for Haiti, El Salvador and some African countries, the Washington Post reported. In the conversation, held between Trump and several congressmen, the president allegedly called those countries \u201cs---hole countries.\u201d\nTwo of the congressmen at the meeting said they didn\u2019t remember the president using those words and one refused to say one way or another, USA TODAY reported. Another didn\u2019t deny Trump used the words, and one, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, said that he did. Trump denied using the language.\nMore: Fact check: What Trump and Biden got wrong in the final presidential debate\n'They all have AIDS' and 'go back to their huts'\nA year prior, in 2017, the New York Times reported on two of the comments at hand \u2013 that Trump said during a session with his national security team that all Haitians \u201chave AIDS\u201d and that once Nigerian immigrants had seen the U.S. they would never \u201cgo back to their huts.\u201d\nThe sources the Times cited were anonymous staffers who had either attended the meeting or been briefed on it, according to the report. The White House did not deny the \u201coverall description\u201d of the meeting, but \u201cstrenuously insisted\u201d Trump never used the words \u201cAIDS\u201d or \u201chuts\u201d in reference to people from any country, the Times report said.\n'Laziness is a trait in Blacks'\nThe final unverified statement attributed to Trump \u2013 that he said \u201claziness is a trait in Blacks\u201d \u2013 was published in the 1991 book \"Trumped!\", written by a former employee of Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino, John R. O\u2019Donnell. There has been no verification of the statement outside the book\u2019s claim. The Washington Post described the phrase as \u201ca second hand quote, made in a private conversation and written some years after the fact\u201d and said it should be viewed with \u201csome skepticism.\u201d\nTrump did not dispute the quote when asked about it in 1997, but denied it two years later in an interview on \"Meet the Press.\"\nTrump said that, but it needs context\nTwo of the listed comments were indisputably made by Trump. But putting them in context may change the way they\u2019re perceived.\n'Look at my African American over there'\nAt one of his 2016 rallies in California, Trump was telling the crowd a story about how one of his Black supporters once beat up a person dressed in a Ku Klux Klan outfit, using it as an example of his \u201ctremendous African American support.\u201d He saw in the crowd a Black man and called him out.\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m \u2013 oh, look at my African American over here,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLook at him. Are you the greatest? You know what I\u2019m talking about?\u201d\nThe man was Gregory Cheadle, a Republican from California running for office at the time. He later spoke out about it, telling NPR News that he was not a Trump supporter but went to see him speak because he has an \u201copen mind.\u201d\n\"I was not offended by it because he had been speaking positively about Black people prior to that statement,\" he told NPR. \"People around me were laughing (at the fact) that he noticed me and everybody was happy. It was a jovial thing.\"\nMore: Fact check: Neither Biden nor Trump is calling for mandated COVID-19 vaccines\n'Get that son of a b---- off the field'\nIn 2017, Trump spoke with a group of supporters in Alabama about national anthem protests in the NFL.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when someone disrespects our flag to say, \u2018Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out. He\u2019s fired. He\u2019s fired,\u2019\u201d Trump said. While the president did support the language, he wasn\u2019t personally referring to a player.\nYes, he said that\nTwelve of the 28 comments attributed to Trump in the meme were said by him explicitly. Here\u2019s a list of each one, written in the same language used by the Instagram post.\n'These aren\u2019t people. These are animals.'\nThe president made this comment at a 2018 roundtable about immigration in California. \u201cWe have people coming into the country or trying to come in \u2014 and we\u2019re stopping a lot of them \u2014 but we\u2019re taking people out of the country,\u201d he said, according to White House records. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how bad these people are. These aren\u2019t people. These are animals.\u201d\n'When the looting starts, the shooting starts.'\nThe president tweeted this comment in May. It\u2019s in reference to the protests in Minneapolis that occurred after the police killing of George Floyd.\n'Proud boys: Stand back and stand by.'\nTrump made this comment during the first 2020 presidential debate in Cleveland, when asked whether he condemns white supremacy. He condemned white supremacist groups two days after the debate.\n'They should be executed.'\nTrump made this comment about the Central Park Five, a group of Black and Latino men wrongly accused of assaulting a white female jogger in 1989, in a newspaper ad he purchased in 1989. Asked about it again in 2019, he did not apologize for his comments.\n'These thugs.'\nThe president made this comment about Minneapolis protesters in the same tweet as his statement that \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d\n'China virus'\nTrump has repeatedly called COVID-19 the \u201cChinese virus,\u201d dating back to March.\n'Kung flu'\nThe president first used the phrase \u201ckung flu\u201d to describe COVID-19 in June at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally. As the Washington Post reported, it became a rallying cry for the crowd.\n'Total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S.'\nThe president called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d in 2015, a day after Obama\u2019s address from the Oval Office regarding the aftermath of a shooting in California. The shooter was an American citizen, born in the U.S., and his wife was born in Pakistan but was in the U.S. legally, NPR reported.\n'Go back to crime infested places from which they came'\nTrump tweeted this statement in 2019 about an unspecified group of \u201cprogressive Democratic congresswomen,\u201d most likely Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib, also known as \u201cthe Squad.\u201d\n'Pocahontas'\nThe president used the slur \u201cPocahontas\u201d toward Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in 2017 during an NRA speech and has repeated it on numerous occasions.\n'I have a great relationship with the Blacks'\nTrump made this comment during a 2011 appearance on the Talk1300 radio show in New York.\n'Very fine people on both sides'\nThe president made this comment in 2017 in response to violent confrontations in Charlottesville, Virginia, between white nationalists and those opposing them. Trump said that there was a group on one physical side and a group on another physical side, and that both sides were violent. That then led into his statement about \u201cvery fine people on both sides.\u201d\nOur rating: Partly false\nOf the 28 listed comments, Trump made 12 of them as plainly stated. Two he said but they lack context. Four comments are disputed, eight are paraphrased from similar statements he has made and two he did not say.

      "text": "How well do face masks protect against COVID-19?\nGet answers to your questions about face masks, including how to use them properly.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nCan face masks help slow the spread of the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?\nYes. When used with measures such as getting vaccinated, hand-washing and physical distancing, wearing a face mask slows how quickly the virus that causes COVID-19 spreads.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends wearing masks if you choose to, and in specific places and situations.\nIn areas that have many people with COVID-19 in the hospital, the CDC recommends wearing a face mask indoors in public.\nThe CDC says that you should wear the most protective mask that you'll wear regularly, fits well and is comfortable.\nRespirators such as nonsurgical N95s give the most protection. KN95s and medical masks provide the next highest level of protection. Cloth masks provide less protection. The CDC says that surgical N95 masks should be reserved for health care professionals.\nMasking suggestions are a bit different for people at higher risk of serious illness. This includes people with risk factors such as older age. It also includes people with weakened immune systems and those who live with or care for someone with these risk factors.\nFor people at high risk, the CDC suggests you wear a mask that provides you with the most protection possible. Wear a mask while in public indoor spaces when your area has a high number of people with COVID-19 in the hospital.\nCheck with your doctor to talk about when to wear a mask at other times.\nHow do the different types of masks work?\nMedical masks\nMedical masks\nA medical mask\nMedical masks\nAlso called surgical masks, these are loosefitting disposable masks. They're meant to protect the wearer from contact with droplets and sprays that may contain germs. A medical mask also filters out large particles in the air when the wearer breathes in.\nTo make medical masks more form-fitting, knot the ear loops where they attach to the mask. Then fold and tuck the loose material under the edges.\nWearing a medical mask doesn't increase the level of carbon dioxide in the air you breathe.\nKN95 mask\nKN95 masks\nA KN95 mask is a type of respirator that meets certain international standards. It offers more protection than a medical mask does because it filters out both large and small particles when the wearer inhales. But be cautious when buying a KN95. Some may not meet the quality standards, so consider researching the source carefully.\nA N95 mask\nN95 masks\nAn N95 mask is a type of respirator that meets U.S. quality standards. An N95 offers the highest level of protection. It offers more protection than a medical mask does because it filters out both large and small particles when the wearer inhales. Nonsurgical N95s can be used by the general public.\nThe CDC has said surgical N95 masks should be reserved for health care professionals. Like surgical masks, N95 masks are intended to be disposable. But researchers are testing ways to disinfect and reuse them.\nTo work best, N95 masks should fit your face tightly.\nSome N95 masks, and even some cloth masks, have valves that make them easier to breathe through. But these masks don't filter the air the wearer breathes out. For this reason, they've been banned in some places.\nA cloth face mask\nA cloth face mask\nA cloth face mask\nCloth masks\nA cloth mask is intended to trap respiratory droplets released when the wearer talks, coughs or sneezes. It also acts as a barrier to protect the wearer from breathing in droplets released by others.\nThe most effective cloth masks are made of many layers of tightly woven fabric like cotton. A mask with layers will stop more droplets from getting through the mask or escaping from it.\nWearing a mask doesn't increase the level of carbon dioxide in the air you breathe.\nHow to get the most from your mask\nYour mask works best if it fits your face closely and has no gaps around the edges. This helps air and breath move through the mask, not around the edges.\nYou should feel warm air going out the front of the mask when you breathe out. You shouldn't feel your breath coming out under the edges of the mask.\nUse masks that have bendable nose strips, as these help prevent air from leaking out of the top of the mask.\nLayers of material offer more protection.\nSome people choose to wear a medical mask under a cloth mask. In that case, the cloth mask should press the edges of the medical mask against the face. Don't add layers if they make it hard to breathe or block your vision. And don't use another mask with a KN95 or N95 mask.\nIf you wear a KN95 or N95 mask, make sure it fits and seals close to your face.\nA child's mask should be specifically made for children in order to fit properly. Make sure it fits close over the nose, mouth and chin.\nProper use, storage and cleaning of masks also affects how well they protect you. Follow these steps for putting on and taking off your mask:\n- Wash or sanitize your hands before and after putting on your mask.\n- Place your mask over your mouth and nose and chin.\n- Tie it behind your head or use ear loops. Make sure it's tight against your face.\n- Don't touch your mask while wearing it.\n- If you accidentally touch your mask, wash or sanitize your hands.\n- If your mask becomes wet or dirty, switch to a clean one. Put the used mask in a sealable bag until you can get rid of it or wash it.\n- Remove the mask by untying it or lifting off the ear loops without touching the front of the mask or your face. Fold the outside corners together.\n- Wash your hands immediately after removing your mask.\n- Regularly wash cloth masks in the washing machine or by hand. (They can be washed along with other laundry.) Dry them in the dryer or hang them outside in the sun.\n- Throw away disposable masks after wearing them once.\nAnd don't forget these precautions:\n- Don't put masks on anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious or otherwise unable to remove the mask without help.\n- Don't put masks on children under age 2.\n- Don't use face masks instead of physical distancing.\nWhat about face shields?\nExperts do not recommend using face shields instead of masks. It's not clear how much protection shields provide. But wearing a face mask may not be possible in every situation. If you must use a face shield instead of a mask, choose one that wraps around the sides of your face and extends below your chin.\nDo you still need to wear a face mask after you're vaccinated?\nAfter getting vaccinated, you can more safely return to doing activities that you might not have been able to do because of high numbers of people with COVID-19 in your area. However, if you are in an area with a high number of people with COVID-19 in the hospital, the CDC recommends wearing a mask indoors in public. You are considered up to date with your vaccines if you have gotten all recommended COVID-19 vaccine shots when you become eligible.\nNov. 04, 2023\n- Use and care of masks.

      "text": "Origin\nIn January 2022, a Republican party official in Michigan shared the remarkable claim that in Midland public schools, officials were accommodating \"furries\" \u2014 people who sometimes dress as animals or adopt animal alter egos \u2014 by leaving litter boxes in bathrooms so that certain students, while adopting a feline persona, could defecate in them.\nOn Jan. 20, Michigan GOP Co-Chair Meshawn Maddock shared a video of a Midland Public Schools board of education meeting, along with the following description: \"Kids who identify as 'furries' get a litter box in the school bathroom. Parent heroes will TAKE BACK our schools.\"\nLater that day, Midland Public Schools Superintendent Michael Sharrow firmly denied those claims. In a message circulated to district staff and parents, and also published on Facebook, he wrote:\n\"There is no truth whatsoever to this false statement/accusation! There have never been litter boxes within MPS schools.\"\nSnopes has not yet been able to find any evidence to corroborate the claim that a school or schools in Midland, Michigan, have accommodated students adopting a feline alter ego by placing litter boxes in bathrooms. The person most prominently responsible for making that claim \u2014 a local woman named Lisa Hansen \u2014 did not provide any such evidence to Snopes when we asked her for it.\nWe cannot completely rule out the possibility that a litter box might briefly have been placed in a public school bathroom as a joke or a prank, with its presence there subsequently being misinterpreted or misrepresented as being part of a broader policy or trend, but no evidence has surfaced to support that speculation.\nWhat Did a Midland, Michigan, Woman Claim About Litter Boxes in Schools?\nHansen made the claim in question during the public comment segment of a Dec. 20, 2021, meeting of the Midland School District Board of Education. Her contribution can be watched in full below, and an excerpted transcript follows:\n...I'm still wrapping my brain around this a little bit, but yesterday I heard something and I was stunned. And today I am equally stunned and a little bit upset \u2014 well, not a little bit, a lotta bit upset \u2014 furious, I would even use that word. But I want to talk about the fact that \u2014 and I know this is going on nationwide, so it's just not for your, for this board, but our community needs to understand that the agenda that is being pushed through our schools is...somewhat nefarious when it comes to some of the activities.\nSo let's talk about furies \u2014furries [laughs]. It was addressed by a child a couple of months ago that they are put in an environment where there are kids that identify as a furry \u2014 a cat or a dog, whatever. And so, yesterday I heard that at least one of our schools, in our town, has a \u2014 in one of the unisex bathrooms \u2014a litter box for the kids that identify as cats. And I am really disturbed by that.\nI will do some more investigation on that, I know it's going on nationwide, I know it is. It's part of the agenda that's being pushed. I don't even want to understand it, but I think that people need to be aware of it, because I am really upset, as a parent, that my child is put in an environment like that. You know, I'm all for creativity and imagination, but when someone lives in a fantasy world and expects other people to go along with it, I have a problem with that. So, I'm just putting that out there. I will investigate more... [Emphasis is added].\nAfter Hansen's claims were shared widely on social media, Sharrow unequivocally refuted them, writing:\nAt the December 20 Board of Education meeting, a community member addressed the Board of Education. During her comments she stated that litter boxes were provided within MPS student restrooms for those who identify themselves as \"furries.\" Let me be clear in this communication. There is no truth whatsoever to this false statement/accusation! There have never been litter boxes within MPS schools.\nSnopes asked Hansen whether she could provide any concrete evidence to support her claims. Responding by email, Hansen did not provide the evidence requested, but wrote:\nI had heard previously from my child and others that there were disruptive behaviors at school by self identified \"furries\" (kids identifying as a cat or dog) and this seems to be accommodated by school officials. I had never heard of such a thing and it sounded so bizarre. However, since school board meetings, many students, school employees, and others have confirmed that this or some variation of it is tolerated at our schools, along with other disruptive behaviors.\nAsked whether she could put us in contact with anyone who could attest to the presence of the litter box in the bathroom, Hansen said she would try to find witnesses. We will update this fact check if we receive corroborating (or contradictory) accounts."

      "text": "Takeaways\n- While Earth\u2019s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years.\n- According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), \"Since systematic scientific assessments began in the 1970s, the influence of human activity on the warming of the climate system has evolved from theory to established fact.\"1\n- Scientific information taken from natural sources (such as ice cores, rocks, and tree rings) and from modern equipment (like satellites and instruments) all show the signs of a changing climate.\n- From global temperature rise to melting ice sheets, the evidence of a warming planet abounds.\nThe rate of change since the mid-20th century is unprecedented over millennia.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nScientific evidence for warming of the climate system is unequivocal.\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe Evidence for Rapid Climate Change Is Compelling:\n-\nGlobal Temperature Is Rising\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5\nImage credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic. -\nThe Ocean Is Getting Warmer\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean.\nImage credit: Kelsey Roberts/USGS -\nThe Ice Sheets Are Shrinking\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7\nImage: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA -\nGlaciers Are Retreating\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8\nImage: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA -\nSnow Cover Is Decreasing\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9\nImage credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech -\nSea Level Is Rising\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century. The rate in the last two decades, however, is nearly double that of the last century and accelerating slightly every year.10\nImage credit: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Norfolk District -\nArctic Sea Ice Is Declining\nBoth the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly over the last several decades.11\nCredit: NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio -\nExtreme Events Are Increasing in Frequency\nThe number of record high temperature events in the United States has been increasing, while the number of record low temperature events has been decreasing, since 1950.

The ocean has absorbed between 20% and 30% of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions in recent decades (7.2 to 10.8 billion metric tons per year).15, 16\nImage credit: NOAA\nReferences\n1.

In 1824, Joseph Fourier calculated that an Earth-sized planet, at our distance from the Sun, ought to be much colder. He suggested something in the atmosphere must be acting like an insulating blanket. In 1856, Eunice Foote discovered that blanket, showing that carbon dioxide and water vapor in Earth's atmosphere trap escaping infrared (heat) radiation.\nIn the 1860s, physicist John Tyndall recognized Earth's natural greenhouse effect and suggested that slight changes in the atmospheric composition could bring about climatic variations. In 1896, a seminal paper by Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius first predicted that changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could substantially alter the surface temperature through the greenhouse effect.\nIn 1938, Guy Callendar connected carbon dioxide increases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere to global warming. In 1941, Milutin Milankovic linked ice ages to Earth\u2019s orbital characteristics. Gilbert Plass formulated the Carbon Dioxide Theory of Climate Change in 1956.\n3.

      "text": "What are electric and magnetic fields?\nElectric and magnetic fields are invisible areas of energy (also called radiation) that are produced by electricity, which is the movement of electrons, or current, through a wire.\nAn electric field is produced by voltage, which is the pressure used to push the electrons through the wire, much like water being pushed through a pipe. As the voltage increases, the electric field increases in strength. Electric fields are measured in volts per meter (V/m).\nA magnetic field results from the flow of current through wires or electrical devices and increases in strength as the current increases. The strength of a magnetic field decreases rapidly with increasing distance from its source. Magnetic fields are measured in microteslas (\u03bcT, or millionths of a tesla).\nElectric fields are produced whether or not a device is turned on, whereas magnetic fields are produced only when current is flowing, which usually requires a device to be turned on. Power lines produce magnetic fields continuously because current is always flowing through them. Electric fields are easily shielded or weakened by walls and other objects, whereas magnetic fields can pass through buildings, living things, and most other materials.\nElectric and magnetic fields together are referred to as electromagnetic fields, or EMFs. The electric and magnetic forces in EMFs are caused by electromagnetic radiation. There are two main categories of EMFs:\n- Higher-frequency EMFs, which include x-rays and gamma rays. These EMFs are in the ionizing radiation part of the electromagnetic spectrum and can damage DNA or cells directly.\n- Low- to mid-frequency EMFs, which include static fields (electric or magnetic fields that do not vary with time), magnetic fields from electric power lines and appliances, radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, and visible light. These EMFs are in the non-ionizing radiation part of the electromagnetic spectrum and are not known to damage DNA or cells directly. Low- to mid-frequency EMFs include extremely low frequency EMFs (ELF-EMFs) and radiofrequency EMFs. ELF-EMFs have frequencies of up to 300 cycles per second, or hertz (Hz), and radiofrequency EMFs range from 3 kilohertz (3 kHz, or 3,000 Hz) to 300 gigahertz (300 GHz, or 300 billion Hz). Radiofrequency radiation is measured in watts per meter squared (W/m2).\nWhat are common sources of non-ionizing EMFs?\nThere are both natural and human-made sources of non-ionizing EMFs. The earth\u2019s magnetic field, which causes the needle on a compass to point North, is one example of a naturally occurring EMF.\nHuman-made EMFs fall into both the ELF and radiofrequency categories of non-ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum. These EMFs can come from a number of sources.\nExtremely low frequency EMFs (ELF-EMFs). Sources of ELF-EMFs include power lines, electrical wiring, and electrical appliances such as shavers, hair dryers, and electric blankets.\nRadiofrequency radiation. The most common sources of radiofrequency radiation are wireless telecommunication devices and equipment, including cell phones, smart meters, and portable wireless devices, such as tablets and laptop computers (1). In the United States, cell phones currently operate in a frequency range of about 1.8 to 2.2 GHz (2). (For more information about cell phones, see the NCI fact sheet Cell Phones and Cancer Risk.)\nOther common sources of radiofrequency radiation include:\n- Radio and television signals. AM/FM radios and older VHF/UHF televisions operate at lower radiofrequencies than cell phones. Radio signals are AM (amplitude-modulated) or FM (frequency-modulated). AM radio is used for broadcasting over very long distances, whereas FM radio covers more localized areas. AM signals are transmitted from large arrays of antennas that are placed at high elevation on sites that are off limits to the general public because exposures close to the source can be high. Maintenance workers could receive substantial radiofrequency exposures from AM radio antennas, but the general public would not. FM radio antennas and TV broadcasting antennas, which are much smaller than AM antennas, are generally mounted at the top of high towers. Radiofrequency exposures near the base of these towers are below guideline limits (3), so exposure of the general population is very low. Sometimes small local radio and TV antennas are mounted on the top of a building; access to the roof of such buildings is usually controlled.\n- Radar, satellite stations, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices, and industrial equipment.These operate at somewhat higher radiofrequencies than cell phones (1).\n- Microwave ovens used in homes, which also operate at somewhat higher radiofrequencies than cell phones (1). Microwave ovens are manufactured with effective shielding that has reduced the leakage of radiofrequency radiation from these appliances to barely detectable levels.\n- Cordless telephones, which can operate on analogue or DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications) technology and typically emit radiofrequencies similar to those of cell phones. However, because cordless phones have a limited range and require a nearby base, their signal strengths are generally much lower than those of cell phones (1).\n- Cell phone base stations. Antenna towers or base stations, including those for mobile phone networks and for broadcasting for radio and for television, emit various types of radiofrequency energy. Because the majority of individuals in the general population are exposed only intermittently to base stations and broadcast antennas, it is difficult to estimate exposures for a population (4). The strength of these exposures varies based on the population density of the region, the average distance from the source, and the time of day or the day of the week (lower exposures on the weekends or at night) (1). A study that used using personal portable exposure meters to assess exposures to different sources of radiofrequency EMFs among children in Europe found that the single largest contributor to the total radiofrequency EMF exposure was the proximity to base stations (5).\nIn general, exposures decrease with increasing distance from the source (6). Exposures among maintenance workers have been found to vary depending on their tasks, the type of antenna, and the location of the worker in relation to the source (1). Cumulative exposures of such workers are very difficult to estimate. - Televisions and computer screens produce electric and magnetic fields at various frequencies, as well as static electric fields. The liquid crystal displays found in some laptop and desktop computers do not produce substantial electric or magnetic fields. Modern computers have conductive screens that reduce static fields produced by the screen to normal background levels.\n- Wireless local area networks, commonly known as Wi-Fi. These are specific types of wireless networking systems and an increasingly common source of radiofrequency radiation. Wireless networks use radio waves to connect Wi-Fi\u2013enabled devices to an access point that is connected to the internet, either physically or through some form of data connection. Most Wi-Fi devices operate at radiofrequencies that are broadly similar to cell phones, typically 2.4 to 2.5 GHz, although in recent years Wi-Fi devices that operate at somewhat higher frequencies (5, 5.3, or 5.8 GHz) have appeared (7). Radiofrequency radiation exposure from Wi-Fi devices is considerably lower than that from cell phones (8). Both sources emit levels of radiofrequency radiation that are far below the guideline of 10 W/m2 as specified by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (3).\n- Digital electric and gas meters, also known as \u201csmart meters.\u201d These devices, which operate at about the same radiofrequencies as cell phones, transmit information on consumption of electricity or gas to utility companies. Smart meters produce very low level fields that sometimes cannot be distinguished from the total background radiofrequency radiation levels inside a home (9).\nFor household appliances and other devices used in the home that require electricity, magnetic field levels are highest near the source of the field and decrease rapidly the farther away the user is from the source. Magnetic fields drop precipitously at a distance of about 1 foot from most appliances. For computer screens, at a distance of 12\u201320 inches from the screen that most persons using computers sit, magnetic fields are similarly dramatically lower.\nWhy are non-ionizing EMFs studied in relation to cancer?\nPower lines and electrical appliances that emit non-ionizing EMFs are present everywhere in homes and workplaces. For example, wireless local networks are nearly always \u201con\u201d and are increasingly commonplace in homes, schools, and many public places.\nNo mechanism by which ELF-EMFs or radiofrequency radiation could cause cancer has been identified. Unlike high-energy (ionizing) radiation, EMFs in the non-ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum cannot damage DNA or cells directly. Some scientists have speculated that ELF-EMFs could cause cancer through other mechanisms, such as by reducing levels of the hormone melatonin. There is some evidence that melatonin may suppress the development of certain tumors.\nStudies of animals have not provided any indications that exposure to ELF-EMFs is associated with cancer (10\u201313). The few high-quality studies in animals have provided no evidence that Wi-Fi is harmful to health (8).\nAlthough there is no known mechanism by which non-ionizing EMFs could damage DNA and cause cancer, even a small increase in risk would be of clinical importance given how widespread exposure to these fields is.\nWhat have studies shown about possible associations between non-ionizing EMFs and cancer in children?\nNumerous epidemiologic studies and comprehensive reviews of the scientific literature have evaluated possible associations between exposure to non-ionizing EMFs and risk of cancer in children (13\u201315). (Magnetic fields are the component of non-ionizing EMFs that are usually studied in relation to their possible health effects.) Most of the research has focused on leukemia and brain tumors, the two most common cancers in children. Studies have examined associations of these cancers with living near power lines, with magnetic fields in the home, and with exposure of parents to high levels of magnetic fields in the workplace. No consistent evidence for an association between any source of non-ionizing EMF and cancer has been found.\nExposure from power lines. Although a study in 1979 pointed to a possible association between living near electric power lines and childhood leukemia (16), more recent studies have had mixed findings (17\u201325). Most of these studies did not find an association or found one only for those children who lived in homes with very high levels of magnetic fields, which are present in few residences.\nSeveral studies have analyzed the combined data from multiple studies of power line exposure and childhood leukemia:\n- A pooled analysis of nine studies reported a twofold increase in risk of childhood leukemia among children with exposures of 0.4 \u03bcT or higher. Less than 1% of the children in the studies experienced this level of exposure (26).\n- A meta-analysis of 15 studies observed a 1.7-fold increase in childhood leukemia among children with exposures of 0.3 \u03bcT or higher. A little more than 3% of children in the studies experienced this level of exposure (27).\n- More recently, a pooled analysis of seven studies published after 2000 reported a 1.4-fold increase in childhood leukemia among children with exposures of 0.3 \u03bcT or higher. However, less than one half of 1% of the children in the studies experienced this level of exposure (28).\nFor the two pooled studies and the meta-analysis, the number of highly exposed children was too small to provide stable estimates of the dose\u2013response relationship. This means that the findings could be interpreted to reflect linear increases in risk, a threshold effect at 0.3 or 0.4 \u03bcT, or no significant increase.\nThe interpretation of the finding of increased childhood leukemia risk among children with the highest exposures (at least 0.3 \u03bcT) is unclear.\nExposure from electrical appliances. Another way that children can be exposed to magnetic fields is from household electrical appliances. Although magnetic fields near many electrical appliances are higher than those near power lines, appliances contribute less to a person\u2019s total exposure to magnetic fields because most appliances are used for only short periods of time. And moving even a short distance from most electrical appliances reduces exposure dramatically. Again, studies have not found consistent evidence for an association between the use of household electrical appliances and risk of childhood leukemia (29).\nExposure to Wi-Fi. In view of the widespread use of Wi-Fi in schools, the UK Health Protection Agency (now part of Public Health England) has conducted the largest and most comprehensive measurement studies to assess exposures of children to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields from wireless computer networks (30, 31). This agency concluded that radiofrequency exposures were well below recommended maximum levels and that there was \u201cno reason why Wi-Fi should not continue to be used in schools and in other places\u201d (32).\nA review of the published literature concluded that the few high-quality studies to date provide no evidence of biological effects from Wi-Fi exposures (7).\nExposure from cell phone base stations. Few studies have examined cancer risk in children living close to cell phone base stations or radio or television transmitters. Mobile phone base stations transmit and receive radiofrequency signals to and from mobile phones near the station. None of the studies that estimated exposures on an individual level found an increased risk of pediatric tumors (33\u201335).\nParental exposure and risk in offspring. Several studies have examined possible associations between maternal or paternal exposure to high levels of magnetic fields before conception and/or during pregnancy and the risk of cancer in their future children. The results to date have been inconsistent (36, 37). This question requires further evaluation.\nExposure and cancer survival. A few studies have investigated whether magnetic field exposure is associated with prognosis or survival of children with leukemia. Several small retrospective studies of this question have yielded inconsistent results (38\u201340). An analysis that combined prospective data for more than 3,000 children with acute lymphoid leukemia from eight countries showed that ELF magnetic field exposure was not associated with their survival or risk of relapse (41).\nWhat have studies shown about possible associations between non-ionizing EMFs and cancer in adults?\nMany studies have examined the association between non-ionizing EMF exposure and cancer in adults, of which few studies have reported evidence of increased risk (1).\nResidential exposures. The majority of epidemiologic studies have shown no relationship between breast cancer in women and exposure to extremely low frequency EMFs (ELF-EMFs) in the home (42\u201345), although a few individual studies have suggested an association; only one reported results that were statistically significant (46).\nWorkplace exposures to ELF radiation. Several studies conducted in the 1980s and early 1990s reported that people who worked in some electrical occupations that exposed them to ELF radiation (such as power station operators and telephone line workers) had higher-than-expected rates of some types of cancer, particularly leukemia, brain tumors, and male breast cancer (13). Most of the results were based on participants\u2019 job titles and not on actual measurements of their exposures. More recent studies, including some that considered exposure measurements as well as job titles, have generally not shown an increasing risk of leukemia, brain tumors, or female breast cancer with increasing exposure to magnetic fields at work (46\u201351).\nWorkplace exposures to radiofrequency radiation. A limited number of studies have evaluated risks of cancer in workers exposed to radiofrequency radiation. A large study of U.S. Navy personnel found no excess of brain tumors among those with a high probability of exposure to radar (including electronics technicians, aviation technicians, and fire control technicians); however, nonlymphocytic leukemia, particularly acute myeloid leukemia, was increased in electronics technicians in aviation squadrons, but not in Navy personnel in the other job categories (52). A case\u2013control study among U.S. Air Force personnel found the suggestion of an increased risk of brain cancer among personnel who maintained or repaired radiofrequency or microwave-emitting equipment (53). A case\u2013control study found the suggestion of an increased risk of death from brain cancer among men occupationally exposed to microwave and/or radiofrequency radiation, with all of the excess risk among workers in electrical and electronics jobs involving design, manufacture, repair, or installation of electrical or electronics equipment (54). There was no evidence that electrical utility workers who were exposed to pulsed electromagnetic fields produced by power lines were more likely to develop brain tumors or leukemia than the general population (55). Employees of a large manufacturer of wireless communication products were not more likely to die from brain tumors or cancers of the hematopoietic or lymphatic system than the general population (56). A large prospective study among police officers in Great Britain found no evidence for an association between radiofrequency EMF exposure from personal radio use and the risk of all cancers combined (57). A large multinational population-based case\u2013control study found no clear evidence that occupational exposures to radiofrequency radiation are associated with increased risks of glioma or meningioma (58).\nWhat do expert organizations conclude about the cancer risk from EMFs?\nIn 2002, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a component of the World Health Organization, appointed an expert Working Group to review all available evidence on static and extremely low frequency electric and magnetic fields (13). The Working Group classified ELF-EMFs as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans,\u201d based on limited evidence from human studies in relation to childhood leukemia. Static electric and magnetic fields and extremely low frequency electric fields were determined \u201cnot classifiable as to their carcinogenicity to humans\u201d (13).\nIn 2015, the European Commission Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks reviewed electromagnetic fields in general, as well as cell phones in particular. It found that, overall, epidemiologic studies of extremely low frequency fields show an increased risk of childhood leukemia with estimated daily average exposures above 0.3 to 0.4 \u03bcT, although no mechanisms have been identified and there is no support from experimental studies that explains these findings. It also found that the epidemiologic studies on radiofrequency exposure do not show an increased risk of brain tumors or other cancers of the head and neck region, although the possibility of an association with acoustic neuroma remains open (59).\nWhere can people find additional information on EMFs?\nThe National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) website has information about EMFs and cancer.\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration website has information about workplace exposures to ELF-EMF.\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency website has information on power lines and other sources of EMF.\nThe European Commission also has general information on EMF.\nThe World Health Organization website also has information on EMF."

      "text": "Last week, UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot and killed in New York City by a masked assailant in an apparent targeted attack, and the incident has sparked a massive public conversation about the perceived greed of healthcare companies in America.\nYesterday, police apprehended 26-year-old Luigi Mangione as a suspect in the killing at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Mangione was found with a gun, fake IDs, and a handwritten document alluding to an \"ill will towards corporate America,\" according to authorities. He has since been charged with second-degree murder.\nIn light of many people's difficult experiences with the US healthcare industry, there has been a considerable amount of support for Mangione online. And, because it's the internet and Mangione is conventionally attractive...there has been a lot of public lust centered around him.\nDiscussing this phenomenon on Fox News, conservative host Laura Ingraham slammed \"nutbag people\" supporting the shooter and calling Mangione \"cute,\" referring to it as a \"sickness.\"\nThis seems to be standard fare from Fox News \u2014 but the clip is going mega-viral for another reason. Directly after Ingraham's words, she leads into the other top story of the night \u2014 the \"not guilty\" verdict of Daniel Penny.\nFormer Marine Daniel Penny was on trial for the 2023 death of subway performer Jordan Neely, who died after Penny held him in a chokehold for almost six minutes on a New York subway. According to NBC, Neely had entered the train and thrown his jacket to the floor, then said he was hungry and thirsty and wanted to go back to jail. Some passengers reported being fearful, though Neely was unarmed, and other passengers said he didn't even approach anyone, though one passenger said he made \"lunging movements.\" Penny claimed Neely had threatened to kill people and that he was attempting to \"de-escalate\" the situation and restrain Neely until police could arrive.\nThe trial was a microcosm of arguments about race and police brutality in America, as Jordan Neely was Black and Penny is white. Yesterday's \"not guilty\" verdict prompted further discussion and anger at a system that criminalizes homelessness and mental health crises in the US but excuses murder and manslaughter when it comes from a white authority figure.\nOthers, especially conservatives, celebrated the verdict \u2014 Ingraham returned from the break after talking about Mangione to announce, \"Some very good news tonight; I can report that all hope is not lost in New York.\"\nHowever, Ingraham's slamming support for Mangione while suggesting Penny was a hero in almost the same breath felt heavily ironic for many.\nPeople \"translated\" what Ingraham appeared to be saying, calling out her framing for being hypocritical.\n\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting anyone would celebrate the psychopath who killed a CEO. Anyway, after the break we\u2019ll be talking about the American hero who strangled a poor person with mental health issues and got off scot-free! :)\u201d\nAnother user pointed out the difference between the two cases, stating that Neely was poor, Black, unhoused, and suffering from a mental health crisis, while Brian Thompson was rich and white.\nThe juxtaposition of the subway killer being hailed as a hero while the CEO killer is being hailed as a terrorist says everything. Poor people\u2019s lives don\u2019t matter but rich people\u2019s lives do?\nSome people felt that the main difference between the two was that Thompson, as CEO of a healthcare company, was arguably partially responsible for the suffering of millions...\nSo to clarify if someone kills a healthcare CEO overseeing decisions that are actively causing the suffering of millions and deaths of possibly thousands it\u2019s bad but when a random dude decides to murder a homeless man on a subway train in broad daylight just because that\u2019s ok?\nOthers brought up the comparison to another acquitted killer \u2014 Kyle Rittenhouse, who shot three people (two of whom died) in \"self-defense\" during civil unrest in Kenosha in 2020 and was later found \"not guilty\" of homicide.\nI would absolutely feel safer around Luigi Mangione than I would Kyle Rittenhouse or Daniel Penny\nHowever, there were many who agreed with the assessment of Penny as a \"hero.\"\nIt\u2019s funny how people are calling this Luigi guy a hero, but Daniel Penny a criminal. One killed someone in cold blood, the other was protecting people on the subway. This generation is so screwed up"

      "text": "Drinking unpasteurized milk can cause issues like nausea, diarrhea, vomiting or, in some cases, serious illness\nBelieve it or not, there\u2019s a rich history of how humans have prepared their milk. It\u2019s been more than 120 years since Louis Pasteur invented \u201cpasteurization,\u201d a fail-safe process for killing the bacteria raw milk can harbor, including Salmonella, E. coli and Listeria.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nToday, milk is a family staple for good reason. The calcium it contains helps build strong bones and teeth while keeping your heart beating, blood clotting and muscles and nerves functioning.\nBut in recent years, a small but growing number of people have started to prefer unpasteurized \u2014 or raw \u2014 milk and milk products instead of the more standard pasteurized milk. They believe raw milk offers more nutrients, causes fewer allergies and promotes overall health.\nBut despite this rise in drinking milk straight from the cow, many experts warn against the health risks of drinking raw milk.\nRegistered dietitian Erin Rossi, RD, LD, explains how to enjoy your milk in the safest way possible.\nIs drinking raw milk healthier? Most evidence points to a firm \u201cno.\u201d The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that unpasteurized milk is more likely than pasteurized milk to cause foodborne illness that can lead to hospitalization.\nThere\u2019s a reason the milk coming from cows, sheep, goats or other animals needs to be pasteurized before it hits our lattes or cereal bowls. The pasteurization process kills bacteria to make the milk safe to drink. \u201cA little processing goes a long way in preventing the illnesses associated with raw milk,\u201d says Rossi.\nAdvertisement\nDrinking raw milk can increase your risk for illnesses like:\nAdditionally, drinking raw milk can put you at risk for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), also known as bird or avian flu. While avian flu is rare in humans, there are some known cases. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an advisory explaining that this virus can be transmitted by wild birds to other species, including dairy cattle.\nAnd milk from infected cows can carry the HPAI virus. Though it\u2019s still unclear whether you can become infected with HPAI by drinking contaminated raw milk, the FDA still considers it a high-risk food and cautions against consuming it.\nDrinking raw milk doesn\u2019t affect everyone equally. Most healthy people recover quickly from the vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and flu-like symptoms that an infection stemming from raw milk can cause.\nBut older people, children, pregnant women and those with weaker immune systems can quickly get very sick. Symptoms can become chronic, severe and even life-threatening.\nYou should see a healthcare provider promptly if you become ill after consuming a raw milk product \u2014 especially if you\u2019re pregnant.\nRaw milk advocates believe unpasteurized milk provides more nutrients, can prevent allergies and asthma, and even relieve lactose intolerance. It\u2019s important to note that there isn\u2019t any evidence that raw milk can help with these conditions in any way.\nYou may have heard about some other myths around pasteurized vs. unpasteurized milk as well. Here are the raw facts:\nAdvertisement\nSo, what makes a milk \u201cpasteurized\u201d? \u201cPasteurizing milk means you\u2019re heating it to 161 degrees Fahrenheit (71.66 degrees Celsius) for just 20 seconds.
