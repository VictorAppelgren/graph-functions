  "description": "CALGARY, Alberta, Aug.  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) \u2014 Prairie Provident Resources Inc. (\u201cPrairie Provident\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX:PPR) announces its financial and o\u2026",
  "content": "(1) Restated. For further information, refer to the \u201cRestatements\u201d section in the MD&A .\n\n(2) This is a Non-GAAP financial measure. For further information, refer to \u201cAdvisories \u2013 Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\u201d below.\n\n(3) The term barrels of oil equivalent (\u201cboe\u201d) may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. Per boe amounts have been calculated by using the conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet (6 Mcf) of natural gas to one barrel (1 bbl) of crude oil. Refer to \u201cAdvisories \u2013 Barrels of Oil Equivalent\u201d below. Prairie Provident is a Calgary-based company engaged in the development of oil and natural gas properties in Alberta. The Company\u2019s strategy is to optimize cash flow from its existing assets to fund low-risk development and maintain stable cash flow while limiting its production decline. For further information, please contact: This news release contains certain statements (\u201cforward-looking statements\u201d) that constitute forward- looking information within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws. Forward-looking statements relate to future performance, events or circumstances, are based upon internal assumptions, plans, intentions, expectations and beliefs, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated or suggested therein. All statements other than statements of current or historical fact constitute forward-looking statements. Forward- looking statements are typically, but not always, identified by words such as \u201canticipate\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201cexpect\u201d, \u201cintend\u201d, \u201cplan\u201d, \u201cbudget\u201d, \u201cforecast\u201d, \u201ctarget\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d, \u201cpropose\u201d, \u201cpotential\u201d, \u201cproject\u201d, \u201ccontinue\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d or similar words suggesting future outcomes or events or statements regarding an outlook. Without limiting the foregoing, this news release contains forward-looking statements pertaining to Basal Quartz drilling opportunities. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of material factors, expectations or assumptions of Prairie Provident which have been used to develop such statements, but which may prove to be incorrect. Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements, which are inherently uncertain and depend upon the accuracy of such expectations and assumptions. Prairie Provident can give no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained herein will prove to be correct or that the expectations and assumptions upon which they are based will occur or be realized. Actual results or events will differ, and the differences may be material and adverse to the Company. In addition to other factors and assumptions which may be identified herein, assumptions have been made regarding, among other things: results from drilling and development activities; consistency with past operations; the quality of the reservoirs in which Prairie Provident operates and continued performance from existing wells (including with respect to production profile, decline rate and product type mix); the continued and timely development of infrastructure in areas of new production; the accuracy of the estimates of Prairie Provident\u2019s reserves volumes; future commodity prices; future operating and other costs; future USD/CAD exchange rates; future interest rates; continued availability of external financing and internally generated cash flow to fund Prairie Provident\u2019s current and future plans and expenditures, with external financing on acceptable terms; the impact of competition; the general stability of the economic and political environment in which Prairie Provident operates; the general continuance of current industry conditions; the timely receipt of any required regulatory approvals; the ability of Prairie Provident to obtain qualified staff, equipment and services in a timely and cost efficient manner; drilling results; the ability of the operator of the projects in which Prairie Provident has an interest in to operate the field in a safe, efficient and effective manner; field production rates and decline rates; the ability to replace and expand oil and natural gas reserves through acquisition, development and exploration; the timing and cost of pipeline, storage and facility construction and expansion and the ability of Prairie Provident to secure adequate product transportation; the regulatory framework regarding royalties, taxes and environmental matters in the jurisdictions in which Prairie Provident operates; and the ability of Prairie Provident to successfully market its oil and natural gas production.\n\nThe forward-looking statements included in this news release are not guarantees of future performance or promises of future outcomes and should not be relied upon. Such statements, including the assumptions made in respect thereof, involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward- looking statements including, without limitation: reduced access to external debt financing; higher interest costs or other restrictive terms of debt financing; changes in realized commodity prices; changes in the demand for or supply of Prairie Provident\u2019s products; the early stage of development of some of the evaluated areas and zones; the potential for variation in the quality of the geologic formations targeted by Prairie Provident\u2019s operations; unanticipated operating results or production declines; changes in tax or environmental laws, royalty rates or other regulatory matters; the imposition of new or additional tariffs or other restrictive trade measures or countermeasures affecting trade between Canada and the United States; changes in development plans of Prairie Provident or by third party operators; increased debt levels or debt service requirements; inaccurate estimation of Prairie Provident\u2019s oil and reserves volumes; limited, unfavourable or a lack of access to capital markets; increased costs; a lack of adequate insurance coverage; the impact of competitors; and such other risks as may be detailed from time-to-time in Prairie Provident\u2019s public disclosure documents (including, without limitation, those risks identified in this news release and Prairie Provident\u2019s current Annual Information Form dated March 31, 2025 as filed with Canadian securities regulators and available from the SEDAR+ website (www.sedarplus.ca) under Prairie Provident\u2019s issuer profile). The forward-looking statements contained in this news release speak only as of the date of this news release, and Prairie Provident assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise them to reflect new events or circumstances, or otherwise, except as may be required pursuant to applicable laws. All forward-looking statements contained in this news release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. The oil and gas industry commonly expresses production volumes and reserves on a \u201cbarrel of oil equivalent\u201d (\u201cboe\u201d) basis whereby natural gas volumes are converted at the ratio of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel of oil. The intention is to sum oil and natural gas measurement units into one basis for improved analysis of results and comparisons with other industry participants. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip. It does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead nor at the plant gate, which is where Prairie Provident sells its production volumes. Boes may therefore be a misleading measure, particularly if used in isolation. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency ratio of 6:1, utilizing a 6:1 conversion ratio may be misleading as an indication of value. This news release refers to potential drilling opportunities and booked locations. Unless otherwise indicated, references to booked locations in this news release are references to proved drilling locations or probable drilling locations, being locations to which Trimble Engineering Associates Ltd. (Trimble), the Company\u2019s independent qualified reserves evaluator, attributed proved or probable reserves in its most recent year-end evaluation of Prairie Provident\u2019s reserves data, effective December 31, 2024. Trimble\u2019s year\u2011end evaluation was in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities and, pursuant thereto, the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation (COGE) Handbook. References in this news release to potential drilling opportunities are references to locations for which there are no attributed reserves or resources, but which the Company internally estimates can be drilled based on current land holdings, industry practice regarding well density, and internal review of geologic, geophysical, seismic, engineering, production and resource information. There is no certainty that the Company will drill any particular locations, or that drilling activity on any locations will result in additional reserves, resources or production. Locations on which Prairie Provident in fact drills wells will ultimately depend upon the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, seasonal restrictions, commodity prices, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information and other factors. There is a higher level of risk associated with locations that are potential drilling opportunities and not booked locations. Prairie Provident generally has less information about reservoir characteristics associated with locations that are potential drilling opportunities and, accordingly, there is greater uncertainty whether wells will ultimately be drilled in such locations and, if drilled, whether they will result in additional reserves, resources or production.\n\nThis news release discloses initial production (IP) rates for certain wells as indicated. Initial production rates are not necessarily indicative of long-term well or reservoir performance or of ultimate recovery. Actual results will differ from those realized during an initial short-term production period, and the difference may be material. Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures This news release discloses certain financial measures that are \u2018non-GAAP financial measures\u2019, \u2018non-GAAP ratios\u2019 or \u2018supplementary financial measures\u2019 within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws. Such measures do not have a standardized or prescribed meaning under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and, accordingly, may not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers. Non-GAAP and other financial measures are provided as supplementary information by which readers may wish to consider the Company\u2019s performance but should not be relied upon for comparative or investment purposes. Readers must not consider Non-GAAP and other financial measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company\u2019s financial results as reported under IFRS. For a reconciliation of each non-GAAP measure to its nearest IFRS measure, please refer to the \u201cNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\u201d section of the MD&A. This news release also includes reference to certain metrics commonly used in the oil and gas industry but which do not have a standardized or prescribed meanings under the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation (COGE) Handbook or applicable law. Such metrics are similarly provided as supplementary information by which readers may wish to consider the Company\u2019s performance but should not be relied upon for comparative or investment purposes. Following is additional information on non-GAAP and other financial measures and oil and gas metrics used in this news release. (\u201cAFF\u201d) \u2013 AFF is a Non-GAAP financial measure calculated based on net cash from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital, transaction costs, restructuring costs and other non-recurring items. The Company believes that AFF provides a useful measure of the Company\u2019s operational performance on a continuing basis by eliminating certain non-cash charges and charges that are non-recurring or discretionary. Management utilizes the measure to assess the Company\u2019s ability to finance capital expenditures and debt repayments. AFF as presented is not intended to represent cash flow from operating activities, net earnings or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS. AFF per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding consistent with the calculation of earnings per share. AFF per share is a Non-GAAP ratio. \u2013 Operating netback is a Non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in the oil and gas industry, which the Company believes is a useful measure to assist management and investors to evaluate operating performance. Operating netback included in this report were determined by taking oil and gas revenues less royalties and operating expenses. Operating netback, after realized gains (losses) on derivatives, adjusts the operating netback for only the realized portion of gains and losses on derivatives. Operating netback may be expressed in absolute dollar terms or on a per boe basis. Per boe amounts are determined by dividing the absolute value by working interest production. Operating netback per boe and operating netback, after realized gains (losses) on derivatives per boe are Non-GAAP financial ratios. \u2013 Capital expenditures and net capital expenditures are Non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in the petroleum and natural gas industry, which the Company believes are useful measures to assist management and investors to assess Prairie Provident\u2019s investment in its existing asset base. Capital expenditures is calculated as the sum of property and equipment expenditures and exploration and evaluation expenditures from the consolidated statements of cash flows that is most directly comparable to cash flows used in investing activities. Net capital expenditures is calculated as capital expenditures, plus acquisitions from business combinations, which is the outflow cash consideration paid to acquire oil and gas properties, less asset dispositions (net of acquisitions), which is the cash proceeds from the disposition of producing properties and undeveloped lands.",

  "summary": "Prairie Provident, a Calgary-based company engaged in the development of oil and natural gas properties in Alberta, has announced its second quarter 2025 results. The company's strategy is to use existing assets to fund low-risk development and maintain stable cash flow while reducing its production decline. The term \"boe\" may be misleading due to its use of a conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet (6 Mcf) of natural gas to one barrel (1 bbl) of crude oil. This is a Non-GAAP financial measure. The Company's forward-looking statements are based on internal assumptions, plans, intentions, expectations and beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ significantly from those indicated or suggested. Despite these forward statements, Prairie Provident has stated its expectations and assumptions are reasonable and do not guarantee future performance or promises of future performance.",
  "shortSummary": "Prairie Provident's results for the second quarter of 2025 are revised to reflect current operational conditions, but risks and uncertainties remain significant in its development plans and operations.",

      "text": "Canada could be trade winner as U.S. tariffs undershoot global competitors by wide margin, says report\nOxford estimates the U.S.'s current effective tariff rate on Canada is 2.5%\nThe tariff rate imposed on Canadian exports by the United States is estimated to be the lowest amongst the world\u2019s trading countries, meaning that Canada could end up coming out ahead in Donald Trump\u2018s trade war, a new report says.\nOxford Economics Group Ltd. estimates the U.S.\u2019s current effective tariff rate on Canada is 2.5 per cent, placing it below Mexico at four per cent and well below other major U.S. trading partners.\nFor example, the U.S. tariff rate is 35 per cent on China, 15 per cent on Japan, 13 per cent on South Korea and eight per cent on the United Kingdom and the European Union, based on data from calculated duties as a share of imports, Oxford said.\n\u201cIf the relatively low tariffs apparently being paid on imports from Mexico and Canada persist, these two economies could pick up some benefits from shifts in supply chains, although uncertainties over the endgame for tariffs and the future of the (Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement) will be near-term drags,\u201d Adam Slater, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said in the report.\nCUSMA-compliant goods escape U.S. tariffs, though the trade agreement is scheduled to be reviewed in July 2026, but some people, including Ontario Premier Doug Ford, think that deadline could be accelerated. The review also starts the clock ticking on the possible expiration of the agreement in 2036.\nStill, Slater described the current estimates for the tariff rates \u201cas something of a puzzle.\u201d\nOne set of trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau \u2014 specifically labelled CUSMA \u2014 indicates that 56 per cent of goods entering the U.S. from Canada and 47 per cent from Mexico are compliant with the agreement.\nOther Census Bureau data, based on rate provisions, suggests that 91 per cent and 84 per cent, respectively, are entering duty-free, though Oxford said it can\u2019t tell if that is due to CUSMA compliance or \u201csome other exemption.\u201d\n- Canadian steelmakers need to focus on domestic market as tariffs lock them out of U.S.: Algoma CEO\n- Trump put a tariff on gold \u2014 or did he? What you need to know about the bullion confusion\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\n\u201cIt may be the case that tariff exemptions for these economies are broader than assumed,\u201d Slater said.\nSlater said Oxford based its overall 2.5 per cent tariff rate for Canada on a higher level of CUSMA compliance, \u201cwhile not directly\u201d adhering to the 91 per cent level.\nBut trade between the U.S. and Canada hasn\u2019t escaped unscathed.\n\u201cThe biggest negative impacts have been in Canada, where imports are down 25 per cent from January levels, and in China, where imports are down 50 per cent from January,\u201d Slater said, adding that \u201cChinese data on exports to the U.S. shows a much less dramatic decline of around 25 per cent since January,\u201d possibly due to rerouting of goods through other countries.\nIn Canada, 50 per cent tariffs on aluminum and steel exports to the U.S. persist, as do 25 per cent tariffs on the non-U.S. components of vehicles. Trump also recently hiked the tariff on non-CUSMA-compliant goods to 35 per cent from 25 per cent and announced an increased tariff on softwood lumber to 35 per cent.\nOxford\u2019s report also warned that overall global trade is shrinking.\n\u201cA variety of indicators suggest that world trade is weakening,\u201d Slater said, referencing various measures that indicated monthly global imports slowed three per cent in April and May, while an International Monetary Fund port tracker said growth in international exports declined to less than one per cent.\n\u201cOther sea and air freight indicators show similar trends,\u201d he said.\nOxford is estimating that world trade volumes shrunk by about three per cent from the second quarter to the first quarter of 2026, with world trade posting its weakest performance in a four-year period since the recession of the early 1980s.\nIt reduced its global gross domestic product estimate to 2.5 per cent \u2014 \u201chistorically on the low side\u201d \u2014 to 2.8 per cent from 2.9 per cent at the beginning of the year, Slater said.\n\u2022 Email: gmvsuhanic@postmedia.com\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

We asked experts if he\u2019s right\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\n\u201cToday, the Canadian producer wants to be at 35 per cent-plus market share in the United States, in order for the Canadian industry to run at a healthy capacity utilization rate, based on that excess capacity that they have,\u201d Van Heyningen said. \u201cWe today want Canada to be at least 10, 15 points lower, in terms of market share\u201d based on current capacity and future forecast capacity, he said.\nCanada\u2019s market share has already fallen from 35 per cent to about 21 per cent in recent years, he said.\nThe prime minister\u2019s office and Natural Resources Canada didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nResolving the long-running trade dispute with the U.S. remains a top priority, but the new measures will make sure mills keep operating and employees keep working, said Eric Johnson, vice-president of federal government relations with the Forest Products Association of Canada.\n\u201cWe\u2019re never going to diversify our way out of the U.S. The history, the proximity, the product qualities and their sheer demand \u2013 the economics just don\u2019t allow for that,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cBut finding ways to lessen our reliance on them, that\u2019s what this will do.\u201d\n\u2014With assistance from Mathieu Dion.\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "Air Canada says flight attendants talks at 'impasse' as strike notice nears\nAirline says CUPE rejected an offer by the company to enter binding, third-party arbitration\nAir Canada says negotiations with its unionized flight attendants \u201chave reached an impasse\u201d as a statutory 72-hour strike or lockout notice nears.\nThe airline said talks with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), which represents 10,000 of its flight attendants, are deadlocked after the union on Tuesday rejected an offer by the company to enter binding, third-party arbitration.\n\u201cAir Canada now believes the talks are at an impasse, after the union submitted a counteroffer seeking exorbitant increases, beyond those presented in earlier submissions, and today rejected an offer by the company to enter binding, third-party arbitration,\u201d the airline said in a release.\n\u201cThe arbitration process proposed would protect the interests of the parties by having them agree on an independent arbitrator who would impartially take into account the parties\u2019 positions to arrive at a new, balanced contract by which both would abide.\u201d\nAir Canada now believes the talks are at an impasse after it said CUPE submitted a counteroffer seeking pay increases beyond those presented in earlier submissions.\nCUPE, however, said Air Canada no longer wants to negotiate.\n\u201cThey want to go to arbitration, rather than stay at the bargaining table and bargain a new contract,\u201d Wesley Lesosky, president of the Air Canada Component of CUPE, said in a release. \u201cEveryone knows the best deals are negotiated at the bargaining table, not handed down by an outside third-party. Then why does Air Canada want the union to agree to arbitration?\u201d\nThe union will be in a position to issue a statutory 72-hour strike or lockout notice at 12:01 am eastern time on Wednesday, which could shut Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge flights down as early as Saturday morning. Air Canada Express flights operated by Jazz or PAL Airlines will continue to operate as normal, the airline said.\n\u2022 Email: dpaglinawan@postmedia.com\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "Financial market expects Bank of Canada interest rate to fall to 2.25% by year-end\nCentral bank survey finds only 35% chance of recession\nThe financial market believes the Bank of Canada will cut its policy rate to 2.25 per cent by the end of 2025 and then hold it there for all of 2026, according to a survey released by the central bank on Monday.\nThe quarterly survey of 30 financial market participants was conducted between June 25 and July 3, which was well before policymakers decided on July 30 to hold the overnight rate at 2.75 per cent for the third straight time.\nTrade uncertainty, an economy that has proven to be more resilient than initially expected and evidence of underlying inflation were the three main reasons for the central bank holding. Measures of core inflation have hovered around three per cent since April.\nStill, Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem left the door open for further rate relief.\n\u201cIf a weakening economy puts further downward pressure on inflation and the upward price pressures from trade disruptions are contained, there may be a need for a reduction in the policy interest rate,\u201d he said on July 30.\nSurvey respondents\u2019 median expectation for headline inflation was 2.2 per cent by the end of 2025 and two per cent by the end of 2026. They also pegged Canada\u2019s gross domestic product growth at 0.8 per cent at year-end and 1.8 per cent by the end of 2026, and they put the probability of a recession in the next six months at 35 per cent.\nNearly 89 per cent of respondents identified an increase in trade tensions as the main downside risk, while 44 per cent said weaker consumer spending and a weaker housing market.\nAbout 90 per cent cited the easing of trade tensions and larger-than-expected fiscal stimulus as their main upside risks to their growth outlook.\n\u2022 Email: jgowling@postmedia.com\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "Opinion: Get out of the way, Ottawa, and let the 'one-person unicorns' run\nSmall firms that grow lightning fast with few employees don't need incubation by governments. They need freedom to decide things yesterday\nSam Altman\u2019s prediction that artificial intelligence will spawn \u201cone-person unicorns\u201d \u2014 billion-dollar companies run by individual founders \u2014 sounds like Silicon Valley hype. Yet new data suggests Canada\u2019s policy-makers should take Altman\u2019s forecast seriously, not as a reason to tax and regulate, but as an opportunity to unleash our entrepreneurs\u2019 natural advantages.\nAI startups are shattering every conventional business metric: fastest to reach 100 million active users, fastest to hit US$1 billion in valuation, fastest to scale from zero to US$10 billion. Recent standouts like World Labs, Safe Superintelligence and Lovable have all sprinted to billion-dollar valuations with teams of fewer than 50 people. We may be experiencing the dawn of a capital efficiency era that should thrill our innovators.\nThe United States is deploying what we call \u201cbully capital\u201d in AI and corporate venture investing. According to KPMG, global venture capital (VC) funding hit US$368.3 billion in 2024. The U.S. captured $209 billion of this total, with just five startups accounting for $32.2 billion in Q4 alone.\nThis isn\u2019t a rising tide lifting all boats. Asia-Pacific VC money fell to a nine-year low. Europe declined year-over-year. Meanwhile, Canada managed a modest 10 per cent rise to US$4.2 billion \u2014 but strip out Clio\u2019s $670-million outlier round and our sector actually dropped 16 per cent.\nThe math is brutal: US$209 billion in the U.S. versus US$4.2 billion in Canada. The U.S. economy is roughly 13 times larger than Canada\u2019s, yet America raised 50 times more venture financing. Why the difference? In the U.S., corporate venture money accounted for more than half the 2024 total. In Canada, this category barely registers.\nEarly-stage investment\u2019s new efficiency stems from AI\u2019s unique ability to automate what once required armies of workers. A single developer now deploys AI agents that handle customer service, curate content and optimize operations, all simultaneously. When algorithms replace head count, traditional constraints \u2014 hiring, training, managing \u2014 evaporate.\n- Opinion: We need serious cuts to Ottawa\u2019s bloated bureaucracy\n- William Watson: AI predicts Trump tariffs will raise U.S. prices\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nConsider the entertainment parallel. U.S. YouTuber MrBeast generates US$82 million annually with a lean crew. These micro-multinationals are individuals using globally distributed digital platforms. Hollywood\u2019s talent-centric model is migrating to technology, powered by AI\u2019s multiplicative productivity gains.\nThe implications for Canadian competitiveness are profound. Our universities produce world\u2011class AI research: by Stanford\u2019s 2024 AI Index, Canada ranks among the top countries for AI publications and the share of highly cited papers, with Toronto and Montreal recognized as global hubs.\nThis intellectual edge has been built over decades with broad, light\u2011touch supports from federal granting agencies and SR&ED (the \u201cscientific research and experimental development\u201d tax credit). Our point is to avoid layering new, program\u2011heavy projects on top of what already works: solo AI founders need speed and simple rules, not procedure.\nThe conventional government response to these new AI possibilities will be to want to \u201csupport\u201d the transition through subsidies, bureaucratic \u201cincubators\u201d and programs, likely byzantine programs. This approach fundamentally misunderstands the AI revolution. One-person unicorns succeed precisely because they avoid institutional friction. They need speed, not committees or special commissions. Resources, not consultants. Clear rules \u2014 preferably no rules \u2014 not regulatory complexity.\nOttawa\u2019s optimal strategy is simplicity itself: maintain R&D tax credits, ensure stable intellectual property protection, and resist micromanagement. When human genius replaces money or infrastructure as the scarcest resource, success flows from entrepreneurial freedom.\nThe venture industry is adapting rapidly. Specialized funds now offer agency-style investments, advancing resources to promising individuals before they form teams. Day One Ventures backs solo founders from day one. Latent Ventures launched a \u201cSolopreneur Fund.\u201d These investors understand that backing exceptional individuals often beats funding legacy corporate structures.\nSmart money tracks data signals that predict individual success: GitHub code velocity, open-source follower counts, real-time user engagement. These indicators let private investors validate solo-founder traction far faster than government-backed financing.\nFor Canadian business builders, the message is clear: master lean operations, use AI for automation, build personal brands that accelerate customer acquisition. The future belongs to those who command massive resources with minimal dilution.\nThe economic math is compelling. If AI startups already achieve extraordinary efficiency, reaching US$1 billion with single-digit staff is actually plausible. Factor in rapidly rising AI power and investor appetite for \u201clean\u201d plays and Altman\u2019s prediction seems more and more reasonable.\nCanada faces a stark choice. We can embrace this epochal change by creating the world\u2019s most founder-friendly environment for AI expertise. Or we can watch our brightest minds migrate to jurisdictions that understand the new rules.\nThe one-person unicorn era rewards countries that trust markets over mandates, individuals over institutions, innovation over intervention. Canada\u2019s competitive advantage lies, not in government programs, but in entrepreneurial excellence unleashed.\nThe future of prosperity belongs to nations that recognize genius and grit as their rarest minerals and give that brilliance maximum freedom to innovate. For Canada, the path forward is clear: step aside and let our AI pioneers get on with changing the world.\nRay Sharma, a tech entrepreneur, is co-founder, with publisher, entrepreneur and professor Neil Seeman, of EPS, an educational program to support first-time company founders.\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.
