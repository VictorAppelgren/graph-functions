  "description": "Economists believe the Chancellor will need to find at least \u00a320bn in her November Budget",
  "content": "Tony Blair swept into Downing Street to the sound of Things Can Only Get Better by D:ream. For Rachel Reeves, a rewrite may be required \u2013 Things Can Only Get Worse.\n\nThe Chancellor has set the clock ticking on her second Budget, announcing that it will be held on Nov 26.\n\nReeves is already under pressure, with bond yields rising and the pound weakening. Speculation is rife over which taxes will have to go up to fill yet another black hole. As things stand, economists believe she will need to find \u00a320bn or more to restore the public finances to health.\n\nThe Chancellor will be hoping that things will improve between now and the Budget.\n\nPerhaps the turmoil in financial markets will ebb. Perhaps the Government will find some new productivity-boosting wheeze to convince the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to upgrade its growth forecasts.\n\nYet on current trends, things look more likely to get worse than better. Here are five reasons why the Chancellor should be wary.\n\n1. Bond yields are unlikely to improve\n\nInterest rates on 30-year UK bonds are currently at highs not seen since 1998, meaning the Government must pay handsomely for the borrowing it sorely needs.\n\nThis is not like 2022, when a spike in bond yields in the wake of the mini-Budget brought down Liz Truss\u2019s government.\n\nThen, borrowing costs subsided after Truss changed tack and, eventually, resigned.\n\nThis time around, other nations are also seeing steady rises in bond yields, indicating that debt is getting more expensive globally. It suggests there there is little room for any serious relief in the weeks to come.",
