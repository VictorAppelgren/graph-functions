      "feedback": "The draft capably organizes a two-regime narrative (cloud/AI vs EV/subsidy) and leverages concrete data (Azure/backlog, Rivian details, policy signals), but it violates the SECTION FOCUS in four places: it returns 5+ lines of movers instead of exactly 4 (2 Up, 2 Down), it interleaves an Outlook/0–3 weeks scaffold with the movers, and several lines carry non-actionable or undated prompts rather than crisp, trigger-driven bets. To upgrade to world-class quality, recast into exactly 4 lines (Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %), with 0–3 months and 3–6 months horizons, drawing solely on evidence-backed drivers and anchoring probabilities to explicit material signals; replace all near-term narrative hedges with explicit numeric weights (e.g., Up 0–3 months 65–75% anchored by 0G3A676BP for Azure/backlog durability; Up 3–6 months 50–60% anchored by P0K0UEOHU for R2 ramp); Down 0–3 months 25–40% anchored by U1KRCQOYR for sanctuary-injunction risk; Down 3–6 months 40–50% anchored by V7GV8YBQU/C3ODMIQKZ/RHXDOHQQX for inflation/policy trajectory. Ensure each line cites only IDs when asserting facts or numbers (e.g., 0G3A676BP, P0K0UEOHU, U1KRCQOYR, V7GV8YBQU). Remove the 0–3 weeks and the separate Outlook text; if you include a Swing Trade plan, keep it to 1–2 lines and embed precise fields (Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence %) with explicit triggers (R2 milestones, backlog trajectory, or policy shifts) tied to the same source IDs. Strengthen first-principles by a compact causal chain: cloud/AI capex drives durable earnings power and higher multiples; EV/subsidy sensitivity hinges on policy continuity and tariff/credit cycles; invalidate with a clear threshold (e.g., backlog contraction or R2 ramp miss) and triggers (Azure growth deceleration, R2 milestones unmet, or a policy reversal). Finally, tighten citation density to cover all critical sources (0G3A676BP, TN66GHPAT, P0K0UEOHU, 4LQD15CFU, UPV3X2MQ6, FOM34PUWA, A7VLN74BK, V7GV8YBQU, C3ODMIQKZ, RHXDOHQQX, U1KRCQOYR, 8VMO3PFEO, 4S007SRUL, S7M6BJSRT, J99EM2TPZ) and reconcile any conflicts by prioritizing the cloud/AI regime as the durable anchor and treating EV/subsidy as optionality with policy timing as the primary risk.",
