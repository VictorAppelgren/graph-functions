  "title": "Ford invests $5 billion on EV plant expansion, electric trucks",
  "description": "The automaker\u2019s Kentucky factory revamp is the first step in its plan to deliver affordable, mass-market EVs \u2014 starting with a truck in 2027",
  "content": "The automaker is investing nearly $2 billion to overhaul its 70-year-old Louisville Assembly Plant, transforming a gas-vehicle-era workhorse into the launchpad for a midsize, four-door electric pickup that the company says will start around $30,000 when it rolls out in 2027.\n\nPaired with a $3 billion battery plant in Michigan, the two projects represent a $5 billion bet on making EVs that can compete on price, quality, and scale \u2014 without bleeding red ink. Ford said the work will create or secure almost 4,000 U.S. jobs, including about 2,200 in Louisville.\n\nWhat\u2019s coming to life is an \u201cassembly tree,\u201d where three sub-lines feed into one, which Ford said will shave 15% off build time and cut part counts by 20% and workstations by 40%.\n\nThe new truck will be the first built on Ford\u2019s \u201cUniversal EV Platform,\u201d which is designed for a family of affordable, software-enabled electric vehicles. The company says the architecture uses 20% fewer parts and 25% fewer fasteners than comparable models, trims the wiring harness by more than 4,000 feet, and incorporates lithium-iron-phosphate prismatic batteries that double as the vehicle floor. The design lowers the center of gravity for better handling and frees up more passenger space \u2014 Ford claims it\u2019ll have more than the latest Toyota RAV4 \u2014 along with a \u201cfrunk\u201d and a bed.\n\nOn the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, Ford\u2019s CEO, Jim Farley, cast the endeavor as a \u201cModel T moment,\u201d positioning the project as a breakthrough in bringing EVs to the mass market. The goal: deliver an EV that\u2019s affordable, efficient, and built by American hands \u2014 and that actually makes money. The company\u2019s EV unit, Model e, lost more than $5 billion in 2024 and another $1.3 billion in the second quarter of this year. With federal EV tax credits set to shrink, Ford needs lower costs to compete with Tesla, GM, and a growing slate of cheaper Chinese players such as BYD.\n\nThe electric truck is designed to be more affordable than Ford\u2019s current F-150 Lightning, which has seen limited market appeal due to the higher price point that it carries. The vehicle will compete against coming electric trucks from other manufacturers such as General Motors and Rivian.\n\n\u201cWe took inspiration from the Model T \u2013 the universal car that changed the world,\u201d Doug Field, Ford\u2019s chief EV, digital, and design officer, said in the press release. \u201cWe assembled a really brilliant collection of minds across Ford and unleashed them to find new solutions to old problems. We applied first\u2011principles engineering, pushing to the limits of physics to make it fun to drive and compete on affordability. Our new zonal electric architecture unlocks capabilities the industry has never seen. This isn\u2019t a stripped\u2011down, old\u2011school vehicle.\u201d\n\n\u200b\u200bFord\u2019s strategy is in contrast with some of its competitors in the auto industry. GM has scaled back some of its electric vehicle targets, while other automakers have expressed caution about EV investments amid concerns about profitability and consumer demand. Right now, the EV market faces headwinds: high battery costs, supply chain challenges, and intense price competition. Still, Ford is betting that improvements in manufacturing efficiency and scale will eventually lead to profitability \u2014 and that it can develop EVs for mainstream consumers.\n\n\u201cWe have all lived through far too many \u2018good college tries\u2019 by Detroit automakers to make affordable vehicles that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty,\u201d Farley said in a press release. \u201cSo, this had to be a strong, sustainable and profitable business. From Day 1, we knew there was no incremental path to success. \u2026 We tore up the moving assembly line concept and designed a better one. And we found a path to be the first automaker to make prismatic LFP batteries in the U.S.\u201d\n\nKentucky officials are backing the project with incentives through the state\u2019s Economic Development Finance Authority. The plant will also get a 52,000-square-foot expansion and a digital network upgrade to support more quality checks. The Louisville plant is expected to keep producing gas-powered SUVs alongside the new EVs during the transition, with full EV capacity ramping up ahead of the 2027 truck launch. If the strategy works, it could give Ford a template for converting other legacy plants \u2014 and a much-needed foothold in a segment where price, speed, and scale now decide the winners.",
