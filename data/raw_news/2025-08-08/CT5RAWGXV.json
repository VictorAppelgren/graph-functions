  "description": "TSX:SJ 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore Stella-Jones's Fair Values from the Community and select yours Key...",
  "content": "Explore Stella-Jones's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\u2022 Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Stella-Jones fair value estimate is CA$55.76\n\u2022 Stella-Jones is estimated to be 34% overvalued based on current share price of CA$74.50\n\u2022 The CA$87.00 analyst price target for SJ is 56% more than our estimate of fair value In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Stella-Jones Inc. (TSE:SJ) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit. We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = CA$1.5b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.4%. Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= CA$3.6b\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.4%)10= CA$1.6b The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is CA$3.1b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of CA$74.5, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Stella-Jones as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.384. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling. Pipelines and storage facilities will be critical to moving larger volumes of oil and gas efficiently, especially with the renewed emphasis on LNG exports to meet global demand.\n22 companies\nChevron\nMarket Cap: US$312.8b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in the integrated energy and chemicals operations in the United States and internationally.\nCVX\nUS$153.16\n7D\n1.0%\n1Y\n6.0%\nWilliams Companies\nMarket Cap: US$71.6b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States.\nWMB\nUS$57.89\n7D\n-3.4%\n1Y\n32.0%\nKinder Morgan\nMarket Cap: US$59.4b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in North America.\nKMI\nUS$26.76\n7D\n-4.6%\n1Y\n27.0%\nCheniere Energy\nMarket Cap: US$52.3b\nAn energy infrastructure company, primarily engages in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) related businesses in the United States.\nLNG\nUS$235.27\n7D\n-0.3%\n1Y\n30.5%\nMarathon Petroleum\nMarket Cap: US$49.4b\nOperates as an integrated downstream energy company in the United States.\nMPC\nUS$161.51\n7D\n-5.1%\n1Y\n-7.3%\nONEOK\nMarket Cap: US$47.4b\nOperates as a midstream service provider of gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage, and marine export services in the United States.\nOKE\nUS$75.48\n7D\n-8.1%\n1Y\n-11.5%\nDT Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$10.6b\nProvides integrated natural gas services in the United States.\nDTM\nUS$104.21\n7D\n1.4%\n1Y\n40.4%\nAntero Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.9b\nOwns, operates, and develops midstream energy assets in the Appalachian Basin.\nAM\nUS$18.46\n7D\n0.6%\n1Y\n31.2%\nHess Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.8b\nOwns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream assets and provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers in the United States.\nHESM\nUS$41.02\n7D\n-5.8%\n1Y\n13.9%\nKinetik Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$6.4b\nThrough its subsidiaries, operates as a midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin.\nKNTK\nUS$41.53\n7D\n-4.3%\n1Y\n0.3%\nPBF Energy\nMarket Cap: US$2.6b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in refining and supplying petroleum products.\nPBF\nUS$22.30\n7D\n-1.3%\n1Y\n-40.7%\nRattler Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$2.2b\nRattler Midstream LP owns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream and energy-related infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.\nRTLR\nUS$15.22\n7D\n3.5%\n1Y\n45.0%\nPar Pacific Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.4b\nOperates as an energy company in the United States.\nPARR\nUS$27.13\n7D\n-13.5%\n1Y\n9.9%\nDelek US Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.2b\nEngages in the integrated downstream energy business in the United States.\nDK\nUS$20.74\n7D\n-7.3%\n1Y\n2.3%\nClean Energy Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$448.6m\nOffers natural gas as alternative fuels for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions in the United States and Canada.\nCLNE\nUS$2.04\n7D\n0.5%\n1Y\n-31.3%\nOPAL Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$409.2m\nEngages in the production and distribution of renewable natural gas (RNG) for use as a vehicle fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets throughout the United States.\nOPAL\nUS$2.26\n7D\n-4.6%\n1Y\n-38.6%\nSummit Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$304.9m\nFocuses on owning, developing, and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets primarily shale formations in the continental United States.\nSMC\nUS$24.84\n7D\n-2.5%\n1Y\n-32.9%\nGranite Falls Energy\nMarket Cap: US$91.1m\nEngages in the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products in the continental United States.\nGFGY\nUS$2,975.00\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a\nStabilis Solutions\nMarket Cap: US$89.3m\nAn energy transition company, provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation, and fueling solutions primarily using liquefied natural gas (LNG) to various end markets in North America.\nSLNG\nUS$4.45\n7D\n-3.3%\n1Y\n7.2%\nVivakor\nMarket Cap: US$47.0m\nOperates, acquires, and develops technologies and assets in the oil and gas industry in the United States and Kuwait.\nVIVK\nUS$0.95\n7D\n-13.6%\n1Y\n-51.5%\nMirage Energy\nMarket Cap: US$684.0k\nThrough its subsidiaries, focuses on developing an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States.\nMRGE\nUS$0.0013\n7D\n8.3%\n1Y\n-81.9%\nEnergtek\nMarket Cap: US$51.4k\nProvides natural gas delivery solutions based on mobile pipe-less technologies and products.\nEGTK\nUS$0.0001\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a"
