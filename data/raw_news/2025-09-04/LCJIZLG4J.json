  "content": "Adobe Premiere Pro users will be happy to hear there\u2019s an iPhone app launching later this month, which the company is promising will be closer to the capabilities of its desktop app than the cut-down Premiere Rush app.\n\nThe company will also be hoping to attract those who are newer to video editing on iPhone, in order to create a potential new market for the desktop app \u2026\n\nPremiere Pro is a popular choice for filmmaking and videography pros, so the availability of an iPhone app comes as good news.\n\nThe existing Premiere Rush iPhone app is being discontinued on September 30, the date when the new app launches. The older app had limited capabilities, requiring handoff to the Mac app for many tasks. Adobe says that the new app will be significantly more powerful, yet still simple enough for anyone to use.\n\nEasily create, edit, and share sharp, stylish videos from anywhere with Premiere on iPhone. It\u2019s powerful enough for any idea, yet simple enough for anyone to use. Quickly turn any idea into attention-grabbing content with amazing creative control, unique audio tools, and generative AI \u2014 and take your creativity on the go with Premiere on iPhone. Trim, reorder, and layer clips with no-fuss precision and control in a sleek, intuitive multi-track timeline. Get cinematic color and adjust with a tap. And easily add captions and animated text. Share videos that pack a punch. Choose from hundreds of thousands of images, videos, stickers, fonts, and more to make your videos pop \u2014 or explore new ideas with generative AI right at your fingertips. Generate unbelievable sound effects with a simple text prompt \u2014 or use your voice alongside a prompt to get the timing and intensity just right. And get crystal-clear voiceover recordings with just a tap. Kick off a project on mobile, then pick up where you left off in the Premiere Pro desktop app to polish it up with advanced tools and creative control.\n\nThe company says that the app is free to use and that you\u2019ll only pay if you need more storage or want to use the generative AI capabilities, which will require Adobe credits. The company promises that your work will not be used to train AI models.\n\nThe app will initially be iPhone-only, with an Android version to follow at a later date.\n\nAdobe Premiere will be available from the App Store from September 30.",
