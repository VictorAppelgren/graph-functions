  "content": "You can never be too safe.\n\nOne crime scene investigator can\u2019t erase some of the horror she\u2019s experienced on her job \u2014 so much so that she\u2019s taken extra security precautions at her home to protect herself.\n\nAmy Santoro is a real-life Olivia Benson \u2014 as she\u2019s been working in forensics and on crime scenes for almost 20 years.\n\nAfter working on over 1,000 cases, some would think the 39-year-old has become numb to what she witnesses on the job, but it seems that some situations remain in her memory bank.\n\nAs a result, she set up her home to resemble a \u201cfortress\u201d just to be extra safe.\n\n\u201cThroughout my career, I saw all the things that could go wrong,\u201d she told NeedToKnow.\n\n\u201cMy house is secured like a fortress and I tend to be hypervigilant. [Because] I saw how easily burglars could kick in a door and gain access to a house, so I have reinforced door jams and extra-long deadbolt locks.\u201d\n\nAfter seeing firsthand all the frightening ways someone could weasle their way into a home, Santoro has all her windows \u201clocked and I have security window tracks that prevent them from being opened,\u201d she told the outlet.\n\nShe also explained how the entry points to her house are alarmed and she \u201cnever leaves a ground-floor window open.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw lots of burglary cases and peeping Tom situations where people could see straight through the house at night because the curtains were never drawn, so I always make sure to close my blinds at night when the lights are on inside.\u201d\n\nSome would think the 39-year-old\u2019s job has made her paranoid, but she says it\u2019s just made her more \u201caware.\u201d\n\nAnd how does someone who works around such dark things day in, day out take her emotions out of it and still see the good in people?\n\n\u201cEvery time I think I\u2019ve seen the worst of humanity, something worse happens. Most of it is stuff people wouldn\u2019t want to think about, but I\u2019ve gotten used to it at this point.\u201d\n\nYet despite all of that, Santoro remains hopeful that there are good people out there.\n\n\u201cBut, more than that, I\u2019ve seen how good people are. In every terrible situation, there are people who are willing to step up and help,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve really been able to see how communities come together and how families work to support each other. Overall, I think people are genuinely good.\u201d",

      "text": "Toothpaste made out of hair could be on shelves in two years \u2014 scientists say it\u2019s the secret to stopping tooth decay\nMint to be?\nFluoride in toothpaste has been shown to strengthen tooth enamel, making our chompers more resistant to acids from plaque and bacteria that cause tooth decay.\nResearchers from King\u2019s College London say they have identified a substance that can protect against decay and repair early-stage damage better than fluoride. Brace yourself \u2014 it\u2019s found atop your head.\n\u201cWe are entering an exciting era where biotechnology allows us to not just treat symptoms but restore biological function using the body\u2019s own materials,\u201d said Sherif Elsharkawy, senior study author and consultant in prosthodontics at King\u2019s College London.\n\u201cWith further development and the right industry partnerships,\u201d he added, \u201cwe may soon be growing stronger, healthier smiles from something as simple as a haircut.\u201d\nKeratin \u2014 a protein in human hair, skin, nails and the wool of sheep \u2014 forms a dense mineral coating that mimics the structure and function of natural enamel, protecting teeth and potentially sealing exposed nerve channels that cause sensitivity.\nThe UK researchers hope to channel the power of keratin into a daily toothpaste or a professionally applied gel that can target problem areas.\nThey envision a product hitting shelves in two to three years.\nFor this study, they harvested keratin from wool. They found that when the protein is applied to the tooth surface, it interacts with minerals naturally present in saliva to create a crystal-like structure that resembles enamel.\nThis so-called \u201cscaffolding\u201d continues to attract calcium and phosphate ions from saliva, paving the way for an enamel-like coating to grow over time.\nTooth enamel lacks living cells, which means it cannot be regrown by the body. Once it\u2019s lost, it\u2019s gone.\nThe keratin findings are being hailed as an advancement in regenerative dentistry, a field focused on harnessing the body\u2019s own healing mechanisms instead of synthetic materials to repair and regrow damaged dental tissues.\nThe study was published this week in the journal Advanced Healthcare Materials.\n\u201cKeratin offers a transformative alternative to current dental treatments,\u201d said Sara Gamea, PhD researcher at King\u2019s College London and first author of the study.\n\u201cNot only is it sustainably sourced from biological waste materials like hair and skin,\u201d she continued, \u201cit also eliminates the need for traditional plastic resins, commonly used in restorative dentistry, which are toxic and less durable.\u201d\nTooth decay affects nearly 90% of adults 20 to 64 years old and about 46% of children.\nPoor oral hygiene, acidic foods and drinks, sugar, aging, genetics and conditions such as dry mouth, gastroesophageal reflux disease and teeth grinding can contribute to enamel erosion, which can cause tooth sensitivity, pain and tooth loss."

Monkey-barring or monkey-branching, experts warn, is all about sneakiness and betrayal.\n\u201cMonkey-barring and polyamory are fundamentally different,\u201d Angelika Koch, relationship expert at Taimi, explained, as per Vice.\n\u201cMonkey barring is based on codependency and is arguably a form of cheating, while polyamory is based on the ability to love several people in a romantic way at once and isn\u2019t cheating because everyone involved consented.\u201d\nAs Koch further explained, \u201cPeople who do this often lack emotional growth, because they are constantly moving through life in a fear-based manner to avoid the hard work it takes when healing from wounds in a past relationship.\u201d\nThe love guru also noted that \u201cmonkey-branching\u201d or \u201cmonkey-barring is ultimately a \u201cfear-based action, normally based on codependency.\u201d\n\u201cMany people enjoy the thrill of doing this because it provides the security that you won\u2019t be alone.\u201d\nShe stressed that jumping from \u201cone potential partner to the other doesn\u2019t allow you room to truly grow and get to know yourself,\u201d something you need to do before any successful relationship \u2014 romantic or platonic.\nAs The Post previously reported, this isn\u2019t the only dating trend lately to come with a catchy name.\nFor example, \u201cBanksying,\u201d inspired by the elusive street artist, describes a partner who slowly grows emotionally distant \u2014 leaving their unsuspecting other half blindsided, much like Banksy\u2019s surprise artworks.\nThen there are \u201csubmariners,\u201d who vanish for months only to resurface in your DMs as if nothing happened, a toxic trend where ghosters casually return from the dating deep.\nExperts and heartbroken daters alike warn: in the jungle of love, watch out for branch-hoppers, Banksys and submariners \u2014 your heart isn\u2019t a playground."

Of course, you can\u2019t wear it to a family park. Be so for real. I am so happy they are finally cracking down.\u201d\n\u201cDisney and the gym are two different places.

      "text": "Mom donates daughter\u2019s pony to zoo \u2014 so that it can be devoured by lions: \u2018Nothing goes to waste\u2019\nHold your horses.\nA Danish woman donated her daughter\u2019s pet pony to a zoo in Denmark \u2014 so it could be eaten by lions.\nPernille Sohl reportedly gifted her teenage daughter Angelina\u2019s German riding pony, Chicago 57, to the Aalborg Zoo in the country\u2019s northern region.\nZookeepers have said they\u2019re hoping to mimic the natural food chain of predators by feeding them smaller donated pets.\n\u201cIt might sound very dramatic and bizarre that you would feed your pet to animals in the zoo,\u201d Sohl, 44, told the Times UK. \u201cBut they are going to be put down anyway and it is not like they are alive when they are given to the predators.\u201d\nAalborg Zoo has asked for donations of \u201ca healthy animal that needs to be given away for various reasons\u201d \u2014 including guinea pigs, rabbits and chickens \u2014 to be \u201cgently euthanized\u201d before being used as a meal, the facility said in a Facebook post.\n\u201cIn zoos we have a responsibility to imitate the natural food chain of the animals \u2014 in terms of both animal welfare and professional integrity,\u201d it added.\nHorses will also be accepted \u2014 and euthanized and slaughtered \u2014 by the zoo, with owners eligible for a tax deduction, Aalborg Zoo added on its website.\n\u201c[N]othing goes to waste \u2014 and we ensure natural behavior, nutrition and well-being of our predators,\u201d the zoo wrote on Facebook.\nSohl said that her daughter\u2019s pony was donated after it was euthanized due to pain from a longterm health struggle in 2020.\nChicago 57 was suffering from a form of eczema brought about by mosquito bites that became irritated in the summer and lead to open wounds that risked infection. He had to wear a jacket and leg protection toward the end of his life and was 22 when he died.\nAngelina was just 13 at the time of her beloved pony\u2019s death \u2014 and Sohl gave her the choice of whether or not to donate the body to the zoo.\n\u201cI gave Angelina the various options and she chose the one with the zoo, because it made the most sense,\u201d Sohl said.\n\u201cShe wanted to follow the food chain. She wanted Chicago 57 to benefit other animals,\u201d Sohl added.\nSohl \u2014 who runs a small farm in Denmark that allows children with mental health issues to spend time with horses \u2014 had the Aalborg Zoo euthanize Chicago 57, and she was there for the procedure.\n\u201cThere was a zookeeper standing there cuddling and kissing him \u2014 as if it was me standing with him,\u201d she said.\nAalborg Zoo houses three carnivorous and dangerous species: Asiatic lions, polar bears, and the Sumatran tiger, per its website.\nSohl was so impressed with the process that she tried to bring another horse that had died to Aalborg last year, but was turned down because the horse was taller than the maximum height required for his body to fit in the zoo\u2019s refrigerator. His remains were instead repurposed as dog food.\nThe zoo has received global backlash in the past few weeks after its Facebook post requesting small animal donations went viral.\nBut this year alone, Aalborg Zoo has so far received a total of 22 horses, 137 rabbits, 53 chickens and 18 guinea pigs.\nThe Times reported that cats and dogs are not accepted as donations for the animals."
