      "text": "2025 US Open results: Amanda Anismova takes down Iga Swiatek in back-to-back sets\nNEW YORK \u2013 Iga Swiatek knew that it wouldn't be an easy matchup this time around against Amanda Anisimova.\nThe last time these two met was at the Wimbledon finals in July, where it took Swiatek just 57 minutes to beat Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 for her sixth Grand Slam title.\nThat double bagel in a Grand Slam women's singles final was a rarity and the first since the 1988 French Open, when Steffi Graf beat Natasha Zvereva in just 32 minutes.\nBut the results were much different this time, as Anisimova exacted revenge from that thumping to upset the No. 2 seed Swiatek and 2022 US Open champion, with a 6-4, 6-3 quarterfinal win at Arthur Ashe Stadium.\nAnisimova, the No. 8 seed, certainly got off to a better start in the US Open quarterfinals, finally securing her first point in the two matchups in the first set's second game, and used her forehand effectively to keep Swiatek on the run. She also played a much cleaner first set than at Wimbledon, when she had three double faults and 12 unforced errors. She cut the errors in half and broke Swiatek, taking the first set when her forehand return went wide, leading to loud applause from the sellout crowd.\nAnisimova, one of two Americans left in the singles draw, will face the winner of Naomi Osaka and Karol\u00edna Muchov\u00e1 on Thursday night for a spot in the finals.\n\"The first day I got here, I was like, okay, let's try to make it through one round. This has been such a dream,\" Anisimova said after the match. \"To come back from Wimbledon like that, is really special to me. I feel like I worked so hard so try to turn around from that. And today proved everything for me. I can do it, so this is really special.\"\nIt has been quite a turnaround for the 24-year-old Anisimova, who took a hiatus from the sport in 2023 and returned to Wimbledon the following year, ranked 189th in the world. But after making the Wimbledon finals, while beating No. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka in the semifinals of that Grand Slam, she will rise to a career-high No. 5 in the next WTA rankings following her victory over Swiatek.\nAnisimova dominates second set\nIga Swiatek goes down!\nAfter a humiliating defeat their last time on the court together, American Anisimova has overcome her previous demons, taking down the U.S. Open's No. 2 seed in back-to-back sets: 6-4, 6-3.\nThe second set was partciularly impressive. After Swiatek took the first two games, Anisimova won six of the next seven to emerge victorious. Anisimova's win advances her to the semifinals, where she'll play the winner of Naomi Osaka and Karolina Muchova.\nSwiatek's 2-0 lead ousted quickly in second set\nWith her back against the wall, the tournament's No. 2 seed Swiatek came out swinging to stay alive, winning each of the first two games against Anisimova in the second set.\nAmericans were glad to see Anisimova bounce back though, winning the third and fourth games without much of a sweat to tie things back up.\nThe longer this match goes, the more opportunities Swiatek will have to take advantage of her opponent's mistakes. So, Anisimova's best chance to win may be right now.\nAnisimova wins first set\nAfter failing to win a single game in their last matchup, Anisimova proved that she was out for blood in the first set. Though it was back and forth at first, with each player tied at four games apiece to start, Anisimova won each of the final two games, coming back to do so in both, and win 6-4.\nAnisimova needs just one more set now to avenge her previous loss.\nSwiatek wins first game, Anisimova breaks streak right after\nWell, Anisimova will have to wait to break her 13-game loss streak to Swiatek. It was back-and-forth to start, with both players reaching 30-30 to begin the match, but Swiatek would eventually pull it out.\nThankfully, Anisimova would retaliate immediately, dominating the next game, going up 40-0 before Swiatek would win a single rally. Anisimova would win the game on her third break point opportunity.\nWhen is Amanda Anisimova vs. Iga Swiatek match?\nNo. 8 seed Amanda Anisimova will play No. 2 seed Iga Swiatek in a women's quarterfinal on Wednesday. The match at Arthur Ashe Stadium will start after the completion of the men's quarterfinal between No. 8 Alex de Minaur and No. 25 Felix Auger-Aliassime.\n\u201cAt this stage of the game you're going to play a really tough opponent, regardless,\" Anisimova said after defeating Beatriz Haddad Maia on Monday. \"So, to be able to have a rematch, to face her again and give myself another chance, I'm really, really happy about that.\"\nHow to watch Amanda Anisimova vs. Iga Swiatek\n- When: Approximately 3:10 p.m. ET\n- Where: USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center (Flushing Meadows, New York)\n- TV: ESPN, Tennis Channel\n- Streaming: ESPN+, Fubo\nAmanda Anisimova vs. Iga Swiatek head-to-head record\nAmanda Anisimova and Iga Swiatek have only met once in their professional careers.\nSwiatek blanked Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in this year's Wimbledon final.\nWatch Anisimova vs. Swiatek live on Fubo"

      "text": "Shortest women's Wimbledon finals: Iga Swiatek beats Amanda Anisimova in 57 minutes\nThere was not a more dominant player in the Wimbledon women's singles side of the bracket than Iga Swiatek, and she's a champion for it.\nSwiatek, the No. 4 player in the world, shut out American Amanda Anisimova in straight sets 6-0, 6-0 in the women's singles finals at the 2025 Wimbledon Championship on July 12. It was her sixth straight-sets victory at the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club in the last two weeks.\nSwiatek's big day on the grass court surface turned out to be a historic one for the Polish women's tennis player, who took social media by storm this past week with her favorite meal: strawberries and pasta. The 24-year-old, who has now won six Grand Slam majors, won her first Wimbledon title in timely record fashion: seventh-fastest of the Open era, at 57 minutes.\nThat wasn't the only history made by Swiatek. Her double bagel win over Anisimova also marked just the second ever such score for a women's singles final at Wimbledon \u2014 and the first since 1911. It was also the first double bagel in a Grand Slam women's singles final since the 1988 French Open.\nAs noted by ESPN, Swiatek became just the eighth woman tennis player, and the only active WTA player, to win major titles on all three surfaces. She won her first Grand Slam major title on the clay court surface at the French Open in 2020, while winning her first title on the hard court surface at the US Open in 2022.\nHere's what you need to know on Swiatek's Wimbledon championship:\nHow fast was 2025 Wimbledon women's singles final?\nSwiatek needed just 57 minutes to beat Anisimova in the women's singles finals at the 2025 Wimbledon Championships for her first Wimbledon title.\n\"Honestly, I didn't even dream (of this) because for me it was just way too far,\" Swiatek said post-match on the court of winning Wimbledon. \"I feel like I'm already an experienced player, after winning Slams before, but I never really expected this one.\"\nWhat is the shortest women's singles final at Wimbledon?\nAccording to the Wimbledon website, the shortest match time in the women's singles final at Wimbledon is 23 minutes long, which happened back in 1992 when Suzanne Lenglen of France defeated the American player Molla Bjurstedt Mallory in straight sets, 6-2, 6-0.\nShortest women's singles finals at Wimbledon\nThe 57 minutes it took Swiatek to defeat Anisimova is tied for the 19th-fastest time in Wimbledon finals history and seventh-fastest of the Open era. Here's a look at where Swiatek's time of 57 minutes in the 2025 Wimbledon women's singles final stacks up with other women's singles finals at Wimbledon, per the Wimbledon website:\n- 1.
