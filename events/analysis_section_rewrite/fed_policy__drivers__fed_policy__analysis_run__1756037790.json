      "feedback": "The draft has a solid cross‑topic spine (macro, policy, flows/positioning, valuation) but it needs a tighter, testable causal chain, a disciplined scenario framework, and stricter numeric grounding anchored to the cited IDs. Actionably: (1) replace or augment the narrative with a clean first‑principles chain: platform breadth/AI monetization drives GMV growth, which converts to revenue, margin expansion, and stronger FCF, which then supports a higher multiple; quantify each step where possible (e.g., Azure contracted revenue ~368B and 39% growth imply X implied GMV/revenue progression; Shopify H1’25 GMV ~163B with +29% revenue and +51% operating income imply a margin/FCF upgrade path); (2) align strictly to SECTION FOCUS by synthesizing cross‑topic drivers into a single view with directional bets and a crisp watchlist rather than a loose narrative; provide a near‑term test window (2025–2026) plus a long‑term 2030 horizon; (3) add a formal scenario structure (Base, Up, Down) with explicit catalysts and invalidation rules, e.g., Base: Azure contracted revenue and Shopify monetization continue on plan; Up: faster GMV monetization and margin uplift; Down: GMV growth stalls or macro/capital markets compress multiples; invalidate if two consecutive quarters miss Azure/Shopify milestones or if oil/macroe paths derail liquidity; tie triggers to the cited figures (0G3A676BP, IGP1Q4ZEJ, 48JXC9VDP, J99EM2TPZ) and avoid qualitative hedges; (4) strengthen quantification and avoid platitudes by providing ranges or sensitivity where possible (e.g., how a ±10–20% shift in Azure contracted revenue or Shopify GMV growth would alter implied EV/FCF paths), and explicitly state denominator/units; (5) tighten citation density and consistency: anchor every factual claim to the IDs you cite, reconcile any conflicts among sources (e.g., oil oversupply vs inflation signaling in J99EM2TPZ versus macro risk in the base case), and ensure no non‑ID statements appear; (6) sharpen the watchlist into 5–6 decisive signals with sign, trigger level, and a clear invalidation rule; (7) fix potential ambiguities (verify Lulu vs Lululemon cash/debt claims and clarify whether “contracted revenue” refers to Microsoft Azure or a broader moat metric, and confirm the numbers so they don’t contradict underlying source data). In one paragraph, propose a crisp causal map, a three‑scenario deck with explicit triggers, a compact numeric sensitivity note anchored to the four IDs, and a tightened watchlist, all explicitly aligned to 2030 as the horizon and 2025–2026 as the near‑term test.",
