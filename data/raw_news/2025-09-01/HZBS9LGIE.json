  "content": "Ukraine said on Monday that it had arrested a suspect in the murder of a former Ukrainian parliamentary speaker, accusing Moscow of involvement in one of the most high-profile killings since the war began.\n\n\u201cWe know that this crime was not accidental. There is a Russian trace in it,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s police chief, Ivan Vyhivskyi, said in a statement that included a blurred photo of the suspect taken during his arrest. The police did not identify him or disclose a motive, and they did not explain or provide evidence for why they believed he was linked to Russia.\n\nMr. Vyhivskyi said the suspect had carefully prepared the attack, disguising himself as a delivery worker before opening fire on the Ukrainian politician, Andriy Parubiy, in broad daylight on a street in the western city of Lviv. \u201cEight shots. Coldblooded cruelty,\u201d Mr. Vyhivskyi said.\n\nAfter the attack, the statement added, the suspect \u201cchanged clothes, got rid of the weapon\u201d and hid in the western Khmelnytskyi region, which borders the Lviv region. He was found by the police after a 36- hour manhunt.",
