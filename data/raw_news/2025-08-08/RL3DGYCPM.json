  "title": "Tencent's Horizon Zero Dawn 'ripoff' looks different after Sony lawsuit",
  "description": "Light of Motiram's marketing materials on places like Steam have been adjusted so they no longer evoke Horizon Zero Dawn following a lawsuit from Sony",
  "content": "In July, Sony sued mega gaming corp Tencent over the Chinese publisher's upcoming project, Light of Motiram. The issue, as described by Sony, is that consumers could be confused by Light of Motiram's marketing, which was seemingly designed to evoke the image of Horizon Zero Dawn. A couple of weeks later, it seems like Tencent is taking heed: Storefront pages and trailers for Light of Motiram have been scrubbed and redone to look and sound quite different.\n\nLight of Motiram is an open-world action game where players face off against colossal robots shaped like animals, set in a world that combines a futuristic aesthetic with an Indigenous people bent. The game sounds like a mishmash of popular ideas in that it also includes concepts like crafting, co-op base building, and some light platforming elements. Still, it was hard to ignore the similarities to Sony's first-party franchise, Horizon Zero Dawn. Beyond the basic concept of taking down giant robots that look like ancient creatures, the protagonist was highly reminiscent of Horizon protagonist Aloy. That was especially the case when Motiram's protagonist was depicted wearing a specific piece of headgear, which more closely mimicked the long-haired, leather-focused look Aloy is now known for. Images on storefronts also appeared to be staged in a similar way to Horizon Zero Dawn assets in terms of framing and coloring.\n\nIt didn't help that Sony alleges that Tencent approached the PlayStation maker with a pitch for an Eastern Horizon Zero Dawn spinoff, and that concept included things that would later turn up in Light of Motiram, like survival mechanics. Together, all of these factors were enough ammunition for Sony to sue Tencent over Light of Motiram to the tune of $150,000 per work infringed. The lawsuit also specified wanting Tencent to hand over all marketing materials so that Sony could \"destroy\" them.\n\nIt's unclear if Tencent is indeed working with Sony to address the issue, but it seems that the world's biggest gaming company is on the case. If you load up something like Light of Motiram's Steam storefront, nearly all the lead visuals are different now. The original trailer that announced the game seems to have been pulled down, though it survives in re-uploads from other entities. The key artwork that typically acts as a banner on the right side of the storefront has been changed from Motiram's female protagonist to a couple of digital creatures. Both critters are a slightly different shade of blue than the cybernetic colorway that defined Horizon Zero Dawn's look.\n\nSome of the older screenshots remain, but the ones that apparently took inspiration from Horizon Zero Dawn \u2014 specifically ones that feature Motiram's Aloy-like heroine \u2014 are no longer present. The first images also showcase the game with a slightly different tone, with an emphasis on base building and the overworld over robot-focused combat. The description of the game still begins by describing its focus on boss fights, but it no longer mentions the fact those battles are against primal robots. Really, it's a lot vaguer as to what the player will be doing, other than surviving somehow:\n\nWith these adjustments to the marketing, Light of Motiram almost comes across like a different game. Granted, these are only cosmetic changes. But Light of Motiram hasn't been released yet, which gives Tencent time to change the game as needed so that it both looks and plays less like a Horizon Zero Dawn knockoff. The release window has been updated to say Light of Motiram is coming out sometime in 2027, which is later than its original window.\n\nSony did not immediately respond to a request for comment. For now, Light of Motiram is still available on platforms like Steam, where it can be added to wishlists. Light of Motiram is also currently a part of the platform's Multiplayer Games Fest, which appears to celebrate Chinese games that can be played with other people through discounts and unlocks, like profile backgrounds.",

      "text": "Seven months ago, Tencent, the world\u2019s biggest gaming company, revealed a new project: Light of Motiram, a futuristic open-world game from studio Polaris Quest where machines rule the land. If that sounds familiar, the actual trailer and its cybernetic animals only further implied a specific inspirational source: Sony and Guerrilla Games\u2019 Horizon series. Now Sony is taking Tencent to court over it.\nFiled on July 25, the lawsuit intends to block Tencent from releasing the game, which it argues violates Sony Interactive Entertainment\u2019s intellectual property, while also seeking $150,000 in statutory damages for each separate work in the Horizon series infringed. In its lawsuit, Sony calls Light of Motiram a \u201cslavish clone\u201d of Horizon that egregiously replicates some of the signature elements found in the PlayStation series.\nNotably, Sony alleges that Tencent approached them in 2024, through its Aurora Studios, with a proposal to work on a mobile Horizon spinoff game, but the Japanese company declined. Tencent\u2019s pitch, according to the lawsuit, proposed adding \u201cEastern aesthetics\u201d and \u201csurvival and crafting, pet taming,\u201d and multiplayer components to the Horizon series. The pitch deck \u201cincluded mock-ups of Eastern-inspired designs and settings, including one of Aloy [\u2026] standing on the Great Wall of China,\u201d the suit alleges.\nThe original trailer for Motiram features machines decked in white and blue, much like the enemies do in Horizon, alongside aboriginal-like attire with a tech bent. The protagonists differ in that Aloy, star of Horizon, has long red hair, whereas the main character in Light of Motiram is a raven-haired woman with a shorter haircut. But the costumes share some similarities, like the predominance of brown leather. Motiram\u2019s protagonist can also wear a helmet that makes her look even more like Aloy, and Tencent is using that combination in its marketing materials. In the lawsuit, Sony requests that Tencent hand over all such marketing materials so that it can destroy them.\nBased on the trailer, Horizon\u2019s not the only arguable influence on Light of Motiram; at one point we see the player character land on a beach in a glider much like the one in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. There\u2019s also a vehicle that is reminiscent of Destiny 2\u2019s sparrow bikes. And to be fair to Tencent, there are some differentiating ideas here, like co-op, base-building, and a focus on crafting. There\u2019s the obligatory chopping a tree footage you see in most modern survival games.\nBut the affinity with Horizon is hard to ignore, as evidenced by fan remarks left on Light of Motiram\u2019s trailer. \u201cWhen you lend your work to your school friend and tell him to copy it but change some things,\u201d jokes the top comment on the YouTube trailer.\nSony taps into this public sentiment throughout the lawsuit, where it cites news articles and comments that call out the similarities as \u201cshameless\u201d and bash Tencent\u2019s game as \u201cHorizon Zero Originality.\u201d\nPolygon contacted Sony Interactive Entertainment for comment on the suit and will update when the company responds. As of this writing, Light of Motiram still has pages on Steam and the Epic Games Store with the ability to wishlist the game."
