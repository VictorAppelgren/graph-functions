      "text": "The best laptops we've tested (July 2025)\nOverview\nTable of Contents\nUPDATE: Jul. 15, 2025, 5:00 a.m. EDT The Asus ZenBook A14, Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Aura Edition, and Framework Laptop 13 (Intel Core Ultra Series 1) are our latest Mashable Choice Award-winning laptops. We'll add them to this guide in next month's update as our new favorite budget Windows laptop, our new favorite 2-in-1, and our new favorite repairable laptop, respectively. In the meantime, you can read more about them here.\nChoosing the best laptop is a largely subjective decision that comes down to your primary use cases, your preferred operating system, and your budget. In other words, there's no such thing as a universally best laptop.\nThis is an annoying fact of life for both laptop shoppers and those of us doling out \"best laptop\" recommendations, since we can't make custom judgment calls for everyone in need of a new machine. (I would love to, but I've got a thing after this.) However, I can confidently point you in the right direction of some standouts that other members of the Mashable team and I have vetted and approved.\nBest laptops to buy 2025\nAs of July 2025, we think the new 15-inch Apple MacBook Air (M4) is the best MacBook for most people. It's a sleek-as-ever notebook featuring impressive performance, open-lid support for two external displays, a great 12MP Center Stage camera, and an extremely reasonable starting price of $1,199 (making it $100 cheaper than its M3 predecessor). What's more, Amazon can't stop putting it on sale.\nThe best Windows laptop we've tested is the 13.8-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop 7, a sophisticated and snappy Copilot+ PC boasting an unrivaled battery life of nearly 23 hours. Note that Microsoft makes an Intel version that may appeal to users wary of Windows on ARM for app compatibility reasons, but it's a business-oriented model with a significant markup.\nRead on for Mashable's in-depth guide to the best laptops of 2025. FYI: We've listed the pricing and specs of our testing units, which may not apply to each laptop's base model\nYou can't judge a laptop by its appearance or advertised specs alone. As such, Mashable utilizes a rigorous hands-on testing process to review and recommend the best laptops to our readers, drawing upon takeaways from real-world usage and the results of industry-standard benchmarks. We record the findings of our testing in a rubric, and each laptop gets scored on a five-point scale on the basis of performance, design/build quality, battery life, and value. Read our full laptop testing methodology.\nThe laptops we review get put to work as our primary computers. This includes trying any unique software or use cases they support. We also subject all of our loaners to a multi-app/tab stress test and Primate Labs' Geekbench 6, which measures CPU performance in common tasks. Gaming laptops get put through additional graphical benchmarking.\nAs we're using a laptop, we zero in on certain components to evaluate its build quality. These include the display, keyboard, touchpad, webcam, speakers, and ports. We also assess its overall aesthetic and portability.\nTo gauge a laptop's stamina, we conduct a battery rundown test that involves playing a looped 1080p version of Tears of Steel, a short open-source Blender movie, at 50 percent brightness and 50 percent volume. Ideally, we hope to get at least 16.5 hours of battery life from MacBooks, 9 hours from Windows laptops and Chromebooks, and one hour from gaming laptops. (They're notoriously power-hungry.)\nWe determine the ultimate value of a laptop by comparing its performance, design/build quality, and battery life to other laptops with similar pricing, specs, release dates, and use cases. We consider any accessories it comes with, any upgrades from its predecessor(s), and its future-proofing.\nApple MacBook Air, 15-inch (M4)\nBest MacBook for most people\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Very competitively priced\n- M4 chip is incredibly powerful\n- Super quiet\n- Supports two external displays with its lid open\n- Nice new 12MP Center Stage camera\n- Same premium design as always\n- Also available in 13-inch size\n- Can get hot under heavy workloads\n- New Sky Blue finish is a little too subtle\n- Still stuck at 60Hz refresh rate\nOur review\nRead Mashable's full review of the 15-inch Apple MacBook Air (M4).\nWho it's for\nApple didn't reinvent the wheel in its latest 15-inch MacBook Air, but a blazing-fast processor, a few fresh features, and a new lower price make it one of the best current-generation laptop deals \u2014 if not the best. It's a fantastic pick for students, professionals, and anyone else in need of a polished, relatively portable laptop, especially those ready to give up an Intel or M1-era MacBook. (It officially feels like a big-enough jump to justify an upgrade.) MacBook Pros are nice, but they're overkill for non-specialty users, realistically.\nWhy we picked this\nSame tried-and-true formula, new fixings. Let's start under its hood: Apple has refreshed its 2025 MacBook Air with an M4 processor, which notched a Geekbench 6 multi-core performance score of 14,992 in our testing. It's 24 percent faster than the M3 version and one of the speediest laptops in our testing database (after the high-octane M4 MacBook Pros and two Windows gaming laptops); Mashable Senior Editor Stan Schroeder called it \"almost overkill\" in his review. All that power means it does get a little hot when you work it hard, but does stay whisper-quiet, at least.\nLess exciting but still notable are the MacBook Air's new open-lid support of two 6K external displays and upgraded 12MP camera, which now has Apple's auto-framing Center Stage and top-down Desk View feature. It also comes in a new sky blue finish, which I've seen aptly described as \"like looking at a gray MacBook and someone shouting 'blue' from a hundred yards away\"... which is to say, it's subtle. Schroeder requested \"real colors\" from Apple the next time it revisits the MacBook Air. (A smoother 120Hz display would also be nice if we're making a wish list \u2014 we've wanted a refresh rate bump for the Air since the M2 era.)\nThe real game-changer here is the M4 MacBook Air's price. Our review unit with 1TB of storage costs $1,599, but the base model with 256GB of storage is only $1,099. You might recall that the 15-inch M3 MacBook Air started at $1,299. \"Apple doesn't do this often, so enjoy it while you can,\" Schroeder wrote. It's a genuinely shocking move for any laptop manufacturer at a time when price hikes are way more common, and it's one of the big reasons why the MacBook Air has reclaimed its Mashable Choice Award-winner status.\nNote that the M4 MacBook Air also comes in an even cheaper 13-inch size with a slightly lower resolution and two fewer speakers (four instead of six, sans force-cancelling woofers).\nDetails\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7, 13.8-inch\nBest Windows laptop for most people\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Amazing, virtually unrivaled performance\n- Industry-leading battery life\n- Elegant, well-made design\n- Fun AI features\n- Some users might have app compatibility issues\nOur review\nRead Mashable's full review of the 13.8-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop 7.\nWho it's for\nThe Mashable Choice Award-winning Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition is an exceptional all-rounder \u2014 the ideal blend of performance, power efficiency, build quality, innovation, and overall value. We recommend it for nearly any Windows user who's due for an upgrade; the only reason you should pass on it is if your go-to apps aren't compatible with Windows on ARM. (An Intel-powered business edition is available, but it'll cost you: The base model is $300 more expensive than the starter Snapdragon version.)\nWhy we picked this\nMicrosoft's Qualcomm-powered flagship laptop stunts on almost every other Windows PC we've gotten our hands on in recent years. Our 13.8-inch Snapdragon X Elite testing unit went nearly 23 hours per charge, making it the longest-lasting laptop we've ever tried. It also nabbed one of the highest Geekbench scores in our database when in \"Best Performance\" mode, zooming past every other Windows machine besides the $2,299 Acer Predator Helios 16 and the $4,485 Lenovo Legion 9i. (The M4 MacBooks also have it beat.) If all that feels like overkill, or its $1,999.99 price tag gives you sticker shock, know that it starts at $1,199.99 with lesser specs.\nDesign-wise, the Surface Laptop 7 has a modern aluminum chassis that comes in four colorways and doesn't cling to fingerprints. Its bright display can hit a refresh rate of up to 120Hz, and its snappy keyboard is paired with a haptic touchpad. You can take your pick from two sizes, too: 13.8- or 15-inch, the latter of which includes a microSD card reader.\nAs a Copilot+ PC, the Surface Laptop 7 has a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) to support a suite of AI features, including Cocreator, a generative art tool in Microsoft Paint, Live Captions, and Windows Studio Effects that can blur backgrounds and improve lighting on video calls. (There's also the sketchy history-saving Recall feature, which you'll have to personally enable. Maybe don't.) You shouldn't buy this laptop for these tools alone, but former Mashable Tech Editor Kim Gedeon found them to be \"attention-stealing\" fun when she tried them.\nThe Surface Laptop 7's Snapdragon CPU is both a blessing and a curse: As an ARM chip, as opposed to an x86 chip from Intel, it's not going to be compatible with certain apps and programs. This might be a problem for students, as some Reddit users have pointed out. (Google Drive support was finally added in December 2024, FWIW.) But if it's a non-issue for you, personally, move this machine to the top of your list.\nDetails\nLenovo Yoga 7i 14 (Gen 9)\nBest budget laptop\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Cool, peppy performance\n- Great keyboard\n- Good port selection\n- Decent battery life\n- Hinges should be stronger\n- Muted and dim display\n- Finicky trackpad\n- Doesn't include a stylus\nOur review\nRead Mashable's full review of the Lenovo Yoga 7i 14 (Gen 9).\nWho it's for\nPrioritizing everyday power over premium design details to come in under $1,000, the Lenovo Yoga 7i 14 (Gen 9) is a practical pick for students and other budget-minded buyers \u2014 and in this economy, a happy medium for those who can't swing both a laptop and a tablet.\nWhy we picked this\nThe Yoga 7i 14 is a pared-down version of our favorite 2-in-1 laptop (Lenovo's Yoga 9i 14) that still hits most of the right marks for a little over half the price. In our testing, the base configuration with an Intel Core Ultra 5 125U processor was able to handle a few dozen tabs without breaking a sweat \u2014 it runs cool and quiet \u2014 and it lasted well over a full eight-hour workday in our battery life benchmark. Its roomy keyboard has adjustable backlighting, and it comes with an ample selection of ports... which happen to be sequestered to one side of its base, but still. And while its speakers aren't anything special, they do sound \"better than average,\" wrote Mashable contributor and reviewer Sarah Chaney. (That's saying something, honestly: I've tried $1,900 laptops that sound like garbage.)\nOf course, opting not to splurge on a nicer, pricier laptop will always mean settling in some ways. The Yoga 7i's rap sheet includes a sub-par webcam, a dim display, a loud and fussy trackpad, and a somewhat weak hinge \u2014 its lid tends to tip back if it's not on a hard surface. As with any cheap laptop, users will have to decide if those shortcomings are worth the sake of savings. For her part, Chaney thought the Yoga 7 14 was \"a great deal\" at its full sticker price, all things considered, but a \"fantastic deal\" if you can catch it on sale for even less. In the past few weeks, we've seen it dip down to just $549.99 at Best Buy.\nDetails\nAlienware m16 R2\nBest gaming laptop\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Nice performance for the price\n- Great variety of ports\n- Satisfying keyboard\n- MUX switch, Nvidia Advanced Optimus let you swap between GPUs for different tasks\n- Handsome look with optional RGB lighting\n- Tinny audio\n- Lame webcam\n- Poor battery life\n- Display could be brighter\nOur review\nRead Mashable's full review of the Alienware M16 R2.\nWho it's for\nDell's latest Alienware m16 R2 is a competent, fairly priced Triple-A machine for those who usually wear headphones while gaming and rarely play on the go. Maybe you need a new every day (non-gaming) laptop, too \u2014 know that it's also easily tone-down-able.\nWhy we picked this\nThe m16 R2 might best be described as the Clark Kent of gaming laptops. Its 2024 redesign brings a smaller footprint (sans thermal shelf) and a \"Stealth Mode\" hotkey that ditches its RGB lighting, so it can be as subtle or showy as you'd like. It also includes an MUX switch that lets users switch between its integrated and dedicated GPUs for different tasks. (Nvidia's Advanced Optimus feature can do this automatically, too.) It's basically designed to lead a double life as an everyday workhorse and gaming champ.\nGoing deeper into the gaming front, our review unit \"[output] impressive performance numbers on demanding games\" for its mid-range specs, Gedeon said. (It packed an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H CPU and an RTX 4070 GPU.) While its 240Hz display felt a tad bit dim to her, it was otherwise smooth and punchy: \"I was impressed with the contrast and vivid colors\" while playing CyberPunk 2077 on it, she wrote. Its springy keyboard and responsive touchpad also got her seal of approval.\nSome of the bigger bummers about the m16 R2 are its tinny speakers, shoddy webcam, and lousy battery life; it only lasted 51 minutes in our video rundown test. It also weighs in at a hefty 5.75 pounds, so forget about taking it on the go \u2014 whether you use it for work or play, it'll shackle you to an outlet. Yet none of these were dealbreakers in the eyes of Gedeon, who ultimately deemed the m16 R2 \"the ultimate RTX 4070 beast of a gaming laptop you can get.\" It's a Mashable Choice Award winner.\nDetails\nHP Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch\nBest Chromebook\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Large and colorful anti-glare display\n- Stylish metallic finish\n- Runs cool and quiet\n- Useful 'Plus' software features\n- Numeric keypad\n- Easily scratched\n- Touchpad and keyboard take some getting used to\n- Unimpressive webcam\n- Muffled speakers\n- Poor battery life\nOur review\nRead Mashable's full review of the HP Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch.\nWho it's for\nHP's Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch is a low-cost, large-screened laptop for those who work in the Google productivity ecosystem and watch a lot of YouTube in their free time. If you like numpads, all the better.\nWhy we picked this\nThis HP Chromebook Plus is helmed by a huge, vibrant display that blew me away when I reviewed it: \"The colors are intense, with good contrast and rich blacks, and an anti-reflective panel preserves that quality at most viewing angles,\" to quote my write-up. I loved using it for movie-watching and light gaming (via Xbox Game Pass). On the clock, it was fast enough to handle my daily workflow, which involves a lot of Gmailing and Google Meeting, though its battery life disappointingly drained before the end of my eight-hour shift. I also found it hard to listen to anything playing on it while naked-eared: Its speakers stink.\nAs a Chromebook Plus, this puppy comes with some interesting software extras like File Sync, AI-powered webcam settings, and support for some multimedia tools (including Google Magic Eraser and Adobe Express). None of them felt revolutionary in my testing, but they're decent value-adds for such a cheap machine.\nAs of Oct. 2024, the Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch also now has Google's Help me write and Help me read tools, a Live Translate feature, generative AI wallpaper and video call backgrounds, a Recorder app, and Gemini access within its app shelf. I haven't tested these yet.\nDetails\nLenovo Yoga 9i 14 (Gen 9)\nBest 2-in-1 laptop\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Decently powerful\n- Beautiful 2.8K OLED display\n- Nice keyboard\n- Great webcam\n- Fantastic audio quality\n- Comes with a Lenovo Slim Pen and a protective case\n- Runs hot and loud\n- Mediocre battery life\n- Chassis clings to fingerprints\nOur review\nRead Mashable's full review of the Lenovo Yoga 9i 14 (Gen 9).\nWho it's for\nThis luxe, fairly lightweight laptop/tablet hybrid is the primo pick for users who value flexibility, audio quality, display quality, webcam quality, and processing power in about that order. Just don't work it too hard or for too long.\nWhy we picked this\nThe 14-inch Lenovo Yoga 9i is a mid-range convertible with upscale, above-its-tax-bracket fixings. It comes standard with a 120Hz 2.8K OLED display that looks so nice, most users needn't bother with its optional 4K OLED upgrade, said Chaney. (That downgrades it to a 60Hz refresh rate, anyway.) Its immersive rotating Bowers & Wilkins soundbar was another high point for her: \"I've never been more impressed by a laptop's speakers,\" she wrote. And its remarkably sharp, clear 5MP webcam makes it fantastic for video calls.\nOn the performance front, the Yoga 9i's Intel Core Ultra 7 155H CPU handled heavier workloads and multitasking with ease, but a few catches. Chaney said it got \"very hot\" after 30 minutes of use and \"sounded like it was getting ready for takeoff\" with 12 Chrome tabs open simultaneously. It ran a bit quieter when unplugged, but that won't be a realistic setup for a full workday: It only lasted just over seven hours in our battery life benchmark.\nStill, those felt like forgivable sins to Chaney when stacked against its premium features, especially for less than $1,500 all-in. (Also worth mentioning: It comes with a free Lenovo Slim Pen worth $59.99.) She called it \"an excellent deal\" at full price, and we handed it a Mashable Choice Award.\nDetails\nApple MacBook Pro, 16-inch (M4 Pro)\nBest laptop for photo and video editing\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Incredibly powerful\n- Great battery life\n- 12MP camera with Desk View feature\n- Snappy keyboard\n- Amazing speakers\n- Thunderbolt 5 ports\n- Nano-texture display option\n- Laughably expensive as tested\nOur review\nRead Mashable's full review of the 16-inch Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro).\nWho it's for\nA majestic piece of modern machinery, Apple's jacked new 16-inch, M4 Pro-fueled MacBook Pro is a future-proofed investment for creative professionals who run intense multimedia-editing apps and software on a regular basis.\nWhy we picked this\nPut simply, this MacBook Pro is a beauteous behemoth. With a Geekbench 6 multi-core score of 22,758, it's the most powerful laptop we've ever tested by a not-close margin. (The runner-up, Lenovo's $4,485 Legion 9i, scored a 17,711.) It \"can handle heavy workloads without a single stutter,\" said Gedeon. It's also incredibly long-lasting, surviving for nearly 21 hours in our battery life benchmark.\nWhile it may look like a pretty standard MacBook on the outside \u2014 minimalist, relatively thin, made from aluminum \u2014 Apple's tacked on a few subtle but noteworthy design upgrades. For one, it now comes with three next-gen Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports for zippy data transfer speeds. (These accompany an HDMI port, an SDXC card slot, a MagSafe 3 charging port, and a headphone jack.) Two, it can hit up to 1000 nits of SDR brightness, a bump from 600 nits in its M3 Pro predecessor. There's also a new option to add a glare-reducing \"nano-texture\" display finish, which wowed Gedeon when she took the laptop into her backyard: \"I didn't have to squint, adjust angles, nor play hide-and-seek with shadows,\" she wrote. And three, the new MacBook Pro's camera is now a 12MP Center Stage shooter (up from 1080p) with support for Desk View, a new feature that produces an overhead view of the user's desk.\nIts six-speaker setup is the same one you'll find in the M3-era Pros, but no complaints there. Gedeon likened its audio quality to a \"gourmet apple pie ... piping hot, golden, and worth every sinful calorie.\"\nAnd by calories, we mean dollars. It's tempting to recommend the M4 Pro MacBook Pro to anyone who values power efficiency in a laptop, but its price point keeps it firmly in \"experts-only\" territory. (Our upgraded testing unit with 48GB of RAM, 2TB of storage, and a nano-texture display came in at $3,649; the base configuration goes for $2,499.) Don't bother with the splurge unless you'll make full use of it on the daily. For what it's worth, though, we also like the new 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro for those with less strenuous workloads; that one starts at $1,599.\nDetails\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop Studio 2\nBest laptop for creative professionals\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Unique and versatile pull-forward design\n- Superb build quality\n- Haptic touchpad with adaptive touch mode\n- 120Hz refresh rate\n- Built-in Surface Slim Pen 2 storage and charging\n- Expensive\n- Hefty\n- Surface Slim Pen 2 sold separately\n- Starting to get a little outdated\nOur review\nRead Mashable's full review of the Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio 2.\nWho it's for\nThe Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio 2 is an unconventional and versatile laptop for a deep-pocketed professional artist who routinely works with a stylus. (And ideally, they'll have one on hand already.) Gedeon also plugged it \"for differently abled users who could take full advantage of [its] adaptive touch trackpad feature.\"\nWhy we picked this\nThe Surface Laptop Studio 2 is, as its name suggests, a laptop. But the unique pull-forward design of its 120Hz, 14.4-inch touchscreen display means it can also \"transform into a digital easel and a tablet,\" Gedeon said, \"[making] it an artist's playground.\" Just like its predecessor from 2021, it's fine-tuned for drawing, sketching, and other creative work \u2014 though it still doesn't come bundled with a stylus, which feels like a silly omission on Microsoft's part. (It does have built-in storage and charging for the Surface Slim Pen 2, at least.) Notably, though, its silky-smooth haptic touchpad has an adaptive touch mode for users with limited mobility; it's the same one on the Surface Laptop 7.\nThings start looking more familiar once you move inside the Surface Laptop Studio 2, as far as higher-end laptops go. There's a desktop-grade Intel Core H-Series processor and an Intel Iris Xe graphics card in the base model, which you can opt to upgrade to a dedicated Nvidia GeForce RTX GPU. It's not technically a Copilot+ PC, but it does have an NPU that equips its 1080p webcam with Windows Studio Effects. It also counts a microSD card reader among its ample array of ports. All that machinery means it's quite a bit heavy, so it'll probably pass on plein air doodling sessions in favor of staying parked on a desk. That said, it has a surprisingly decent battery life for how brawny it is.\nDetails\nAsus Zenbook Duo (2024)\nBest dual-display laptop\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Beautiful displays\n- Excellent for multitasking\n- Can be used in several different modes\n- Good battery life\n- Clicky detachable keyboard\n- Includes stylus and built-in kickstand\n- Quiet audio\n- Mediocre webcam\nOur review\nRead Mashable's full review of the Asus Zenbook Duo (2024).\nWho it's for\nAsus' 2024 Zenbook Duo is the tops for zealous multitaskers who need more screen real estate than a standard laptop can provide, but don't want to haul around a separate monitor. It'll also appeal to those who simply appreciate a good, fair value: It feels like a machine that costs more than $1,500, a number that includes useful accessories to boot.\nWhy we picked this\nThe Mashable Choice Award-winning Zenbook Duo from last year features two bright OLED displays stacked on top of one another, a detachable Bluetooth keyboard that works with both of them, and a built-in kickstand that allows it to shift into different positions. This design could feel super gimmicky if it wasn't executed smartly, but Asus nailed it \u2014 and for well under $2,000. \"[Single]-display laptops are now canceled,\" said Gedeon, who confessed to feeling \"spoiled\" after testing this one in her everyday workflow. \"How can I work on my MacBook Air, my daily driver, without missing the masterful app-juggling capabilities of the Zenbook Duo?\"\nSpeaking of MacBook Airs: The base Intel Core Ultra 7 155H configuration of the ZenBook Duo performed on par with Apple's M2 chipset in testing. (That one powered our former favorite \"budget\" MacBook.) Among other Windows laptops, it scored similarly to the two newer Intel Core Ultra Series 2 models we've tested thus far, which cost a few hundred dollars more. While the Zenbook Duo isn't a heavy lifter, it's more than fine for moderate use. Its quiet speakers and dull webcam won't dazzle anyone who's defecting from Team Apple to Team Windows, but those are minor gripes in the grand scheme of things. For productivity pros, the Zenbook Duo shines where it matters most: adequate speed, plenty of screens, and a fair selling price.\nDetails\nA note about tariffs\nNow is an especially weird time to be shopping for a new laptop. President Donald Trump's tariffs on almost all imports upended the tech market, causing some computer manufacturers to increase their prices and others to temporarily pause U.S. sales. We're monitoring this situation closely and will update this story if any of our current top picks are affected. (None have been so far.)\nFrequently Asked Questions\nUltimately, your budget should reflect your laptop's primary use case(s) and your preferred operating system. Here's what you can expect at different price ranges:\nLaptops that cost $300 to $600 are budget Windows notebooks and Chromebooks reserved for word processing, web browsing, and email sending. Models on the lowest end of this price range tend to be clunkers with pokey Intel Celeron N Series CPUs and eMMC storage; spending a little extra can get you a sleeker machine with a better entry-level processor, more battery life, SSD storage, and a backlit keyboard.\nLaptops that cost $600 to $1,000 are mostly Windows models and high-end Chromebooks with crisper displays and mid-range CPUs that are good for schoolwork, streaming, and casual gaming.\nLaptops priced at $1,000 to $1,500 are peppy Windows ultrabooks, MacBooks, and gaming laptops with plenty of storage space, brighter and prettier displays, enough power for light photo and video editing, and great graphics.\nLaptops that cost more than $1,500 are beautiful, beefy, and blazing-fast MacBooks Pros and Windows desktop replacements that can handle professional content creation and intense gaming.\nIf you commute daily or travel often, a lightweight, slim, and compact laptop in the 11- to 13-inch range will serve you best. If you're a huge movie buff, a gamer, or a creator who doesn't normally take their laptop on the road with them, think about bulking up to a 15- to 17-inch model with heft that affords it more power.\nYou get what you pay for, but some brands' budget laptops can take you pretty far these days, and certain use cases don't necessitate the latest or most powerful specs.

      "text": "DJI knows its way around drones, creator cameras, and wireless mics. But how would a creator keep those powered up while out creating content? A portable power station, of course, and DJI is on its way to becoming a leading manufacturer.\nRemember when we used to go camping and worried about our cell phones running out of juice? Portable power stations have made this fear a thing of yesteryear. In 2024, DJI launched the Power 1000 and the Power 500, which brought 1,000 watt hours and 500 watt hours to the table of portable power, respectively. But the brand loved by content creators went even further this year by introducing the DJI Power 2000, doubling the power potential. Of course, that meant we needed to try it out to see if it's worth the investment and who should own it.\nWhat\u2019s to love about the DJI Power 2000\nStraight out of the gate, the DJI Power 2000 looks awesome on paper and in person. It comes with a massive 2,048 WH capacity, which is twice as much as the previous DJI Power 1000. Charging options are plentiful, and the overall design is simple, and I appreciate the lack of flashy branding on the Power 2000. In fact, it doesn\u2019t even say DJI on the face of the portable power station. It\u2019s also shockingly quiet and only reaches 30 decibels when recharging. I\u2019ve tested air purifiers that are louder than that, and we often sleep with those in the room.\nHere are some standout specs to study before deciding if the DJI Power 2000 is right for your needs:\nSpecs\nCapacity: 2,048 Wh\nContinuous output: 3,000 W\nWeight: 48.5 pounds\nDimensions: 17.6 in. L \u00d7 8.9 in. W \u00d7 12.8 in H\nPower options: AC, 30amp AC, USB-C (140W), USB-A, SDC\nRecharging options: Grid power, solar, car\nBattery type: LFP (lithium ferrophosphate)\nLife cycles: 80 percent capacity after 4,000 cycles\nWarranty: 3 years\nYou also get app compatibility with the DJI Power 2000, which gives you extra control of the portable power station. Plus, you can keep tabs on power levels if you\u2019re not physically near the station. I found this especially useful when recharging the station in the garage since I could check on power percentage without taking (another) trip down the stairs, which would use some of my own power I didn't feel like spending.\nAwesome capacity, output, and charging versatility\nPortable power stations come in a huge range of capacities, and it\u2019s best to consider your needs and desires when deciding on the right model. Like the name suggests, the DJI Power 2000 is loaded up with a 2,048Wh capacity with a maximum continuous output of 3,000W. In real life terms, DJI says this capacity is capable of recharging a phone 114 times, a laptop 18 times, or keeping a projector going for 18 hours.\nIf you use the DJI Power 2000 at home during a power outage, your fridge can stay cooling for up to 40 hours, and a bedside lamp will get a massive 180 hours of life. If you use a CPAP machine to sleep, the DJI Power 2000 makes for a really awesome nightstand accessory during a power outage. This capacity also means you can charge up several devices at the same time. When testing, I charged my phone and a camera battery, all while cooking in an air fryer powered by the DJI portable power station.\nDJI was pretty thoughtful with the charging options on the Power 2000. You get three standard AC ports, one 30 amp, two USB-C ports with 140W power, two USB-C ports with 65W power, four USB-A ports, and two SDC charging ports. For those unfamiliar with DJI drones, they recharge via the brand\u2019s proprietary SDC, so these ports are unique to DJI power stations and you won\u2019t find them on competitor models from other brands.\nThe 140W USB-C ports mean you can fast charge your MacBook Pro, Lenovo Legion, or other high-end laptops that work best with fast charging.\nThe 30-amp AC outlet means you\u2019ll be able to use this model with heftier appliances. And it\u2019s great for anyone who heads out in an RV. Most portable power stations with less than 2,000Wh of capacity don\u2019t include a 30-amp option, which just adds to the versatility that comes with the DJI Power 2000.\nLifespan of LFP batteries is wild\nLike most modern portable power stations, the DJI Power 2000 uses a lithium ferrophosphate battery or lithium iron phosphate battery. You\u2019ll also see these abbreviated to LiFePO4 or LFP. The specifics of these batteries are pretty unnecessary to know \u2014 except that they translate to a wildly long lifespan.\nAfter 4,000 cycles of running the DJI Power 2000 from 100 percent power all the way to zilch, it\u2019ll operate at about 80 percent of its original capacity. In real-life terms, that means you can use all 2,048Wh every single day for almost 11 years before the battery will drop to holding 80 percent of its original power. Did we test this? Absolutely not, but it means this model will last you far, far longer than you\u2019d ever want to own it. Who knows if we\u2019ll even be recharging tech via USB-C in 11 years anyway. Just know this model will last you plenty long.\nNo battery lasts forever (yet), and that\u2019s true of batteries in all portable power stations, but LFP batteries are impressive. Older portable power stations that were first on the market around 2020 are likely using lithium-ion batteries, which tend to crap out after about 800 cycles. Compare that to the 4,000 cycles of the DJI Power 2000, and you now understand why you want to shop for an LFP battery.\nLet\u2019s get high\nAnother feature of the DJI Power 2000 that\u2019s a big upgrade compared to the Power 1000 is its ability to work at altitudes of up to 5,000 meters (that\u2019s 16,404 feet for U.S. kids). That means you won\u2019t be able to pack the DJI Power 2000 on your trip to Everest Base Camp, but it comes damn close to working at that altitude. Instead, you could take it to the summit of Mount Rainier, which is a bit shy of 4,400 meters. But that would require climbing it up there, and we can\u2019t reasonably recommend that.\nBut in more realistic terms, this major altitude means content creators or super ambitious overlanding people can easily rely on the DJI Power 2000 regardless of elevation. This 5,000-meter limit beats older DJI portable power stations that topped out at 3,000 meters. The DJI Power 2000 can now be part of your basecamp set-up on an adventure your mom is absolutely nervous about, so you\u2019re gonna need a charged phone to keep in touch.\nA really, really huge portable power station\nWhat if 2,048Wh just isn\u2019t enough? No problem here because the DJI Power 2000 is capable of expanding to a massive, whopping, major 22,528Wh when fully charged and connected to 10 expansion batteries. Yes, DJI made the Power 2000 compatible with up to 10 expansion batteries. That\u2019s going to get expensive since each additional DJI Expansion Battery 2000 costs about $1,000, but it\u2019s awesome to know this portable power station can turn into an absolute beast. And to DJI\u2019s credit, the expansion battery is sold with a hand truck, so you\u2019ll have a much easier time moving the DJI Power 2000 with its additional battery stacked above it. And each expansion battery comes with its own battery cable.\nThis expansion ability is not only impressive in available watt hours, it means you can rest assured that if your battery needs increase over time, you can still make use of the DJI Power 2000.\nSuper-friendly with DJI drones and ultra-durable\nIf you have a DJI drone and go out on content creation adventures that take you way off-grid, the DJI Power 2000 is pretty damn awesome. DJI drones recharge via the brand\u2019s proprietary SDC ports, and the Power 2000 is equipped with two of these puppies. The brand also has tons of add-on charging accessories that use the SDC ports, like a fast-charging cable for the Mavic drone series and Air 3 series. You can also snag a DJI Power SDC to Car Charger Plug Power Cable, which is nice if you want to recharge from the car or keep the car\u2019s mini fridge powered up.\nDJI also uses durable materials on the Power 2000, so it won\u2019t be an issue if it\u2019s left outside and collects some morning dew. It also comes with a static load-bearing capacity of up to one ton, which means you can pack a bunch of weight on top of the Power 2000 with no issue. That also allows the DJI Power 2000 to work as a step stool for shorter folks.\nThe portability is excellent, but it\u2019s likely overkill for a weekend camping trip\nThe power capacity compared to the physical size of the DJI Power 2000 is nuts. It measures about 18 inches in length, 9 inches in width, and 13 inches tall. That compact size made it super easy for me to pack along in the trunk of my Honda CR-V. However, it\u2019s a bit heavy, weighing a smidge under 50 pounds. That\u2019s still a manageable weight, made more so thanks to the ergonomic handles on both sides, but it\u2019s not a beast I\u2019d like to carry around for long. I also didn\u2019t love carrying it down stairs, since the handles force you to carry it in front of you.\nThe DJI Power 2000\u2019s portability means it\u2019s awesome for taking along to the job site, using it for an outdoor movie night, or packing along for an overlanding adventure. It also offers great reassurance you can keep your fridge cooling and your phone charged during a home power outage.\nIt could also be great for longer camping trips, but I think it might be overkill if you\u2019re only going for a couple of nights and don\u2019t have major power needs. It\u2019s likely heavier and physically larger than you\u2019d need for a short adventure where you just want to be able to scroll TikTok from your tent before bed and cook a few meals. That could be much better suited to the DJI Power 1000 or even Power 500.\nWho turned the lights out?\nOne of the only gripes I could find when testing the DJI Power 2000 was the lack of a built-in light. Many portable power stations come with a built-in light bar or light source of some kind. This makes using it during an unexpected power outage extra convenient. Find your way to the garage, grab the power station, turn on the light bar, and walk your now-lit path into the room where you\u2019ll be using the power station. It\u2019s also great while camping with a portable power station since your campsite now has an extra light.\nNoticeably, the DJI Power 2000 doesn\u2019t have a light. That\u2019s kind of common as we get into larger portable power stations, but given how bare and minimalistic the DJI Power 2000\u2019s face is (something I actually love), I wonder why DJI didn\u2019t add one. I don\u2019t feel this is a deal-breaker, but it\u2019s a feature I sure miss.\nHow does the DJI Power 2000 recharge?\nYou\u2019re in good shape when it comes to recharging the DJI Power 2000. You can do so with a standard AC wall power, but you can also recharge with solar or even from your car. If you go with a regular ol\u2019 wall recharge, you can get from 0 to 100 percent in about 90 minutes. Car charging is slower, as expected. If recharging while driving is going to be your main recharging method, the DJI Power 1kW Super Fast Car Charger might be worth the $300 price tag. That\u2019ll get you back to 100 percent power in about 2.5 hours, which is not bad for giving you 2,048Wh of power.\nIs the DJI Power 2000 worth buying?\nAbsolutely, the DJI Power 2000 is worth buying if it matches your capacity and recharging needs. This model is awesome if you\u2019re looking for a portable power station loaded with no-nonsense features that truly just work the way you\u2019d want them to. The overall size and weight compared to the power that comes with the DJI Power 2000 is impressive. The addition of the 30-amp plug is great for versatility, making this model compatible with plenty of home appliances that are often left out of portable power stations. If you\u2019re looking for a portable power station to recharge a DJI drone, staying in the DJI family is well worth the convenience since you\u2019ll get two SDC charging ports on the Power 2000.\nIf you plan to use a portable power station to recharge a few phones and keep some fairy lights on while occasionally camping on summer weekends, I\u2019d recommend going with a smaller-capacity portable power station. Going smaller will translate to a cheaper price and a lighter weight that\u2019ll be easier to carry around the campsite."

RetailMeNot may, in its sole discretion, extend or shorten the redemption period for a Rewards O\ufb00er. As between you and RetailMeNot, the determination as to what transactions are Qualifying Transactions shall be made by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Bonus Rewards. From time to time, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er a Bonus Reward to certain RetailMeNot members who complete a qualifying activity or who meet certain criteria, as de\ufb01ned in a Rewards O\ufb00er Card or Promotion Landing Page, in addition to or in combination with o\ufb00ers for Online Cash Back Rewards or In-Store Cash Back Rewards. For example, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er certain Bonus Rewards to new members who earn an Online Cash Back Reward for the \ufb01rst time or earn certain Online Cash Back Rewards for the \ufb01rst time. In order to earn a Bonus Reward, you must satisfy all criteria set forth for earning the Bonus Reward as well as the requirements of these Promotion Terms during the promotion period for the Bonus Reward. RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust the promotion period and/or the bonus amount for Bonus Reward, at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Bonus Rewards are a limited time o\ufb00er and all criteria must be satis\ufb01ed within the dates of the Promotion. Returns, Approvals, and No Ownership. For any Rewards O\ufb00er, if you return or exchange the items purchased, complete your purchase before or after the Promotion Period, initiate a purchase that results in a chargeback, or fail to satisfy a Minimum Purchase Amount, or any other conditions speci\ufb01ed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards O\ufb00er Card, RetailMeNot reserves the right to invalidate or withdraw all or part of the Rewards O\ufb00er, or reclaim Reward earnings. The determination of whether or not a purchase quali\ufb01es for the Rewards O\ufb00er and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed is at the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. In the event of a dispute, you may be required to provide your order con\ufb01rmation as proof of purchase. Order confirmations must be provided within six (6) months from the purchase date to qualify for this review. The timing of when RetailMeNot will issue an Approved Reward will vary based on a number of factors. These factors may include the type of Promotion pursuant to which a Reward is o\ufb00ered and your account activity as a member of RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the order and timing in which to process its con\ufb01rmation of eligible purchases. Rewards may be limited where participation exceeds the Total Rewards O\ufb00ers available during Promotion or in other cases, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. RetailMeNot also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reevaluate Approved Rewards, at any time, without notice, including, but not limited to, whether purchases qualify for the Promotion and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed, and RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust or withdraw any Rewards O\ufb00ers or any Approved Rewards (or reclaim Reward earnings), at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Participating in a Rewards O\ufb00er does not give you ownership or any other legal claim to any Reward unless and until RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, determines that you have met all eligibility criteria and ful\ufb01lled all requirements for the Promotion and you have completed the Redemption Process. Rewards O\ufb00ers are provided solely by RetailMeNot and are not underwritten or funded by any other third party. You may not make any claims for Rewards O\ufb00ers against Merchants or any other third party. Notwithstanding that Rewards O\ufb00ers may include o\ufb00ers of cash, prior to redemption, Rewards O\ufb00ers and Approved Rewards have no monetary value and you may not obtain any money or any other thing of value for any Approved Reward or participation in any Rewards O\ufb00er unless and until you complete the Redemption Process and a payment has been issued by RetailMeNot for Approved Rewards. Wallet and Redeeming Rewards. Approved Rewards will be shown in the RetailMeNot Rewards Wallet. You have no vested rights in Approved Rewards unless and until you complete the Redemption Process. If your RetailMeNot account is terminated by RetailMeNot, as provided in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, or if you elect to close your RetailMeNot account, you will no longer be permitted to access the Rewards Wallet or redeem Approved Rewards shown therein. You may redeem Approved Rewards for cash using PayPal or Venmo. Redeeming for cash to Paypal or Venmo. In order to redeem Approved Rewards for cash via PayPal or Venmo, you must: (1) have or create a PayPal or Venmo Account that is linked to the phone number or email address, where applicable, that RetailMeNot has on \ufb01le for you; (2) navigate to the \u201cMy Rewards\u201d section of your account, click \u201cRedeem Rewards\u201d, and then click either \u201cPaypal\u201d or \u201cVenmo\u201d, as applicable; and (3) perform any actions speci\ufb01ed in the RetailMeNot app or website, as modi\ufb01ed from time to time in the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. For example, such actions may include, but are not limited to, authenticating your account by providing a US based cell phone number with SMS capabilities, re-entering a password, and clicking the appropriate link or button. Once you have completed the required steps to redeem Approved Rewards, RetailMeNot will issue a payment to the PayPal or Venmo Account, as applicable, that is linked to the email address, or phone number, as applicable, that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account. An email or text message, where applicable, will be sent to that email address or phone number, where applicable, con\ufb01rming that the payment has been issued. Generally, redemption of an Approved Reward will result in the issuing of payment within minutes, but in some cases may require a longer time period. RetailMeNot is not responsible for lost or stolen payments or for delivery of payments to the wrong PayPal or Venmo account. If an account has not been credited with a Qualifying Transaction in the previous 12 months, it may be deemed an Inactive Cash Back Account. Accounts which meet this criteria will be debited a monthly maintenance fee in the amount of the lesser of $2.00 or the current account balance. Maintenance fees will not draw the account balance below $0.00. Maintenance fees will be assessed until the account balance reaches $0.00 or the account becomes an active cash back user again. Forced Redemptions. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with any limitations or requirements speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot from time to time, including, but not limited to, requirements not to redeem Approved Rewards that exceed amounts speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, from time to time, to cause the redemption of Approved Rewards, in whole or in part, and issue payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, but RetailMeNot undertakes no obligation to do so under any circumstances. You hereby authorize RetailMeNot to perform any such redemptions and issue any such payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, automatically and without further action by you. Abuse and Cancellations. RetailMeNot reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify a user\u2019s account, entire Promotion, or any part of it, or the payment of any Rewards amounts at any time without obligation or notice to you, including, without limitation, if any fraud, technical failures, limit of available Rewards, gaming, human error or any other factor impairs the integrity, availability or proper functioning of the Promotion, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Without limiting anything in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify, terminate or suspend the participation in any Promotion, or otherwise prevent future participation, of any individual it \ufb01nds, or reasonably suspects, to be tampering with the operation of a Promotion (including by submitting or attempting to submit fraudulent or ineligible Receipts) or to be acting in violation of the Promotion Terms or any promotion, or in behaving in an unethical, dishonest, deceptive or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be in violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, RetailMeNot reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. RetailMeNot shall not be liable to you for any suspension, modi\ufb01cation or termination of a Rewards O\ufb00er, Approved Rewards, or the Promotion program. Use of any automated means or more than one account is prohibited and will result in disquali\ufb01cation. In the event of any dispute as to the quali\ufb01cation of potential recipients of a Reward, the authorized account holder of the email address or phone number provided to RetailMeNot at the time the account was created will be deemed the quali\ufb01ed Reward recipient. The \u201cauthorized account holder\u201d is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Each potential recipient of Rewards may be required to show proof of being an authorized account holder. If your account remains inactive for 24 months, RetailMeNot reserves the right to permanently close the Account at which time the cash back rewards will be considered expired and will no longer be eligible for redemption. Before closing the Account, RetailMeNot will attempt to alert you to the fact that your account may be shut down due to inactivity. Premium Services: Certain Services provided by Ziff Davis require registration and payment (such Services are referred to collectively as the \u201cPremium Services\u201d). You are responsible for paying any and all charges relating to your Premium Services account, including without limitation, periodic subscription fees (the initial fee and automatic renewals). You grant to Ziff Davis\u2019 third party payment processor(s) permission to charge your credit card (or other approved payment mechanism) to pay for all such charges. The Premium Service subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each annual, quarterly or monthly renewal thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, unless you cancel at least ten (10) days prior to the renewal date pursuant to the process set forth below. If Ziff Davis does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Premium Services, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT ZIFF DAVIS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU. For CNET Cash Back and Rewards Services Acceptance of terms. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these terms and conditions, and that you agree to be legally bound by all of them. You also acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to review and agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all of these terms and conditions, you may not participate in or use the Services. Eligibility. You represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age. If you are under age eighteen (18), you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services. Rewards. The Services enable you to access and earn rewards, subject to the guidelines herein (\u201cServices\u201d). CNET offers users opportunities to earn cash back on their purchases from Merchants activated by the creation of trackable links (\u201cLinks\u201d) for a Merchant as a way to incentivize the purchase and promotion of the Merchant\u2019s products. Links are configured to track and attribute transactions to you so that you may earn a reward if you or someone to whom you send a Link completes a qualifying transaction with a Merchant. The CNET cashback program is an incentive and promotional program. Some transactions may not earn rewards or may earn at a rate different from the rate indicated by the Service. You are not guaranteed to earn a reward from a transaction for several reasons, without notice to you, including, without limitation: Merchants may alter terms, conditions, or commission rates. Merchants may discontinue their programs. Merchants may exclude certain products from Reward eligibility. Merchants may have technical failures which result in transactions failing to be tracked or attributed to you. Links may fail to function properly. Links may be disabled by web browsers or ad blockers. Merchants may reject transactions due to suspected policy violations. Other: charge-backs, product returns, accounting error, Merchant non-payment, fraudulent transactions, our inability to contact you to validate transactions, your inappropriate distribution of Links, or your failure to comply with Merchant policies. If the Merchant pays less than the expected amount or does not pay a commission for the transaction, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to adjust or cancel the reward. Furthermore, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to withhold, cancel or adjust the amount of any reward, for any reason at any time. By using the Services, you accept this condition. CNET may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any person, including any affiliate, without your consent. Payout timing. We only provide a reward to you after a transaction is successfully tracked and completed, after we receive payment for that specific transaction from the Merchant, and after you accrue the Minimum Redemption Amount (as defined below). Merchants usually have holdback periods during which they hold a pending payment (for example, until the expiration of a return policy and/or until a service is consumed). Rewards remain in a pending state until we receive payment from the Merchant for the associated transaction. After we receive payment and you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, you may request to redeem your rewards. Payout Threshold. A minimum approved balance of $10.00 is required for redemption (the \u201cMinimum Redemption Amount\u201d). This amount may change from time to time, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. If your balance is below the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards will be stored in a record on your account and may be subject to a Dormant Account Fee (as defined below). Once you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards may be redeemed for third-party merchant gift cards. Use of a third-party merchant gift card at a selected merchant will be subject to such merchant\u2019s and/or the gift card issuer\u2019s own terms of service. Coupons. Some rewards may include coupons, discounts or promotions from Merchants (\u201cOffers\u201d). We do not guarantee that Merchants will honor Offers. Offer codes may be expired or invalid. Offers may not be eligible for your transaction, based upon exclusions, terms and conditions determined by Merchants. Offers are not redeemable for any value with CNET. Dormant accounts. If you have pending rewards and your account has no new activity (defined as the earning of a pending reward) for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, we reserve the right to assess a monthly Dormant Account Fee of up to $5.00 USD, until such time as your reward balance reaches $0.00, to recover the cost associated with maintenance of the account. Any Dormant Account Fee we apply may or may not be displayed in your user dashboard. If your account has no new activity for a period of twelve (12) months, we reserve the right to void any remaining balance of rewards in your account. Tax. You are solely responsible for independently assessing and complying with all relevant tax and legal requirements. We shall not provide you with tax or legal advice. Cookies. Some Merchants may place cookies (or other tracking beacons) on your device to recognize your device during a subsequent visit. If you, or those clicking on your shared Link, block or delete cookies, tracking and attribution may be inoperable, in which case no reward shall be earned. Third-Party Services. We do not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products, services or content of Merchants or other third parties. We are not an agent, broker or otherwise responsible for any Merchant\u2019s activities, policies, products or services.

Member Disputes You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Members of the Services. Ziff Davis reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Members and to take action (e.g., account deletion or removal of content posted by a user) if Ziff Davis determines that there has been a violation of the Agreement or if such action is otherwise necessary or desirable, in its sole discretion. 12. International Use We make no claims that any Material, Services or any Content is appropriate or may be downloaded outside of the United States or outside the country where such Material, Services or any Content was produced. Access to the Material, Services or any Content may not be legal in certain countries or for certain persons. If you access any Material, Services or Content from outside of the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction.

No Submission of Unsolicited Ideas Ziff Davis does not accept unsolicited ideas of any kind, including ideas for: advertising; promotions; new products, technologies, processes, or materials; marketing plans; or product names. Please do not send us any such ideas or materials relating to such ideas. This is to avoid any potential misunderstanding or dispute should our products or marketing strategies seem similar to unsolicited ideas submitted to us. If, despite this request, you do send us any unsolicited ideas or materials, we make no assurances that such ideas or materials will be treated as confidential or proprietary. 14. Binding Arbitration In the unlikely event that you\u2019re not satisfied with customer service\u2019s solution, and you and Ziff Davis are unable to resolve a dispute through the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures below, we each agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless expressly limited by this arbitration provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. In arbitration you may be entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (1) Claims Subject to Arbitration: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Ziff Davis and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a current member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. References to \u201cZiff Davis,\u201d \u201cyou,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this Arbitration Agreement include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (including Ziff Davis, Inc., Ziff Davis, LLC, Everyday Health, Inc., Everyday Health Media, LLC, and their affiliates); those entities and our respective agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have claims heard in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action and to a trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement. (2) Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d). A Notice from you to Ziff Davis must be emailed to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com (\u201cNotice Address\u201d). Any Notice must include (i) the claimant\u2019s name, address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) if you are submitting the Notice, any relevant facts regarding your use of the Sites, including whether you have created an account with or receive any newsletters associated with any of the Sites; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person\u2019s dispute. After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). If you are unable to participate in the settlement conference by video, you may attend telephonically upon showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances warranting telephonic participation (e.g., inability to afford equipment or sufficient Wi-Fi due to indigent circumstances). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules). Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 13(2). All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and Ziff Davis have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Procedures in arbitration. (3) Arbitration Procedure: The arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (\u201cNAM Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a75.) The NAM Rules are available online at www.namadr.com or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM. We and you agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements referenced in Section 13(2) and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. Unless we and you agree otherwise, or the applicable NAM Rules dictate otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address and you and a Ziff Davis representative will be required to attend in person. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding only between you and Ziff Davis and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator\u2019s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court. As in court, you and Ziff Davis agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriately represented parties and counsel. Except as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (b)). (4) Arbitration Fees: The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees. (5) Confidentiality: Upon either party\u2019s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law. (6) Offer of Settlement: In any arbitration between you and Ziff Davis, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party\u2019s favor and is less than the defending party\u2019s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party\u2019s favor, the other party must pay the defending party\u2019s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney\u2019s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing. (7) Requirement of Individualized Relief: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then the parties agree such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other arbitrable claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. You agree that any arbitrations between you and Ziff Davis will be subject to this Section 13 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, and, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that this Section 13 amends any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, including with respect to claims that arose before this or any prior arbitration agreement. (8) Opt Out of Future Changes: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if Ziff Davis makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending Ziff Davis an email to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com within 30 days of the posting of the amended arbitration agreement that provides: (i) your full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated with any potential account or newsletter; (v) the relevant Site; and (vi) the approximate date of your initial use of the relevant Site. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether. (9) Mass Filing: If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (\u201cMass Filing\u201d) set forth in NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (\u201cNAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules,\u201d available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements in Section 13(2), until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration. Stage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge. Stage Four: If your claim is not resolved at this time, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 100, then 100 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 100, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 100 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement. You and Ziff Davis agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Ziff Davis acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.(10) Severability: If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein. 15. CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER You and Ziff Davis agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and Ziff Davis may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and Ziff Davis may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Ziff Davis may participate in a class-wide settlement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Ziff Davis waive any right to a jury trial. 16. Limitation Period for Claims You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our sites or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. 17. Miscellaneous We may be required by international, state or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you through e-mail. Subject to the arbitration provision above and for all purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and Ziff Davis each irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, the Borough of Manhattan (the \u201cCourts\u201d) with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or to the Services (including without limitation any Content) and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such an action, suit or proceeding (whether based on forum non conveniens or otherwise); additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances. Ziff Davis\u2019 failure to enforce any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by Ziff Davis, and such waiver shall not be construed as Ziff Davis\u2019 waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 18. New Jersey Residents If, and to the extent that New Jersey law applies, with respect to residents of New Jersey, the terms in Sections 6 (insofar as any claims may arise from, or relate to, consumer protection or fraud and/or misrepresentation, or result in attorney\u2019s fees), 9 and 14 do not limit any rights you may have as a consumer under New Jersey law and are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as permitted by the laws of the state of your residence. Subject to the foregoing, Ziff Davis, third party content providers, and their respective agents reserve all rights, defenses, and permissible limitations under New Jersey law. Nothing in this Section shall modify the binding arbitration clause and waiver for class action and jury trial in Section 13. 19. Australia Residents Nothing in these Terms (including in Sections 6, 9 and 15) limits, excludes or modifies any rights you may have under any law, including under the Australian Consumer Law (the \u201cACL\u201d) and consumer guarantees under the ACL, which may not be limited, excluded or modified by agreement (including where such exclusion, restriction or modification would be illegal or void under such law). 20. Privacy Policy The applicable privacy policy will be made available on the property from which you accessed these Terms. Such privacy policy is incorporated by reference into these Terms. QUESTIONS?Please contact ZDLegal1@ziffdavis.com and insert \u201cTerms of Use\u201d in the subject line if you have any questions or comments about the Agreement, or to report user conduct violating the Agreement."

      "text": "The Home Depot's 2025 Halloween drop is live: Shop Skelly and friends online\nCode Orange: The Home Depot has launched its 2025 Halloween collection online and on its mobile app. The drop marks the return of \"Skelly,\" the home improvement retailer's iconic 12-foot skeleton, and the debut of a new 6.5-foot app-controlled Ultra Skelly.\nThe collection went live around 6:30 a.m. ET on August 4, and all items are only available while supplies last. (Skelly, its Ultra variant, and several other animatronics are limited to one per customer.) Some will eventually hit Home Depot store shelves later this fall.\nThis Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n\"This year\u2019s collection has something for everyone,\" said Aubrey Horowitz, the Home Depot's decorative holiday merchant, in a press release. \"Whether you\u2019re a Halloween enthusiast adding to your collection or a family starting new traditions, we\u2019ve combined creativity, quality, and value to make your celebrations even spookier.\u201d\nThis is the Home Depot's first Halloween drop of the year. It scrapped a \"Halfway to Halloween\" launch in April, disappointing collectors and sparking conspiracy theories among its active fandom on Facebook.\nThe Home Depot 2025 Halloween collection: What's new and what's not\nSkelly helms the Home Depot's marquee \"Grave & Bones\" collection for the sixth year in a row at its usual price of $299. It's joined for the first time by the shorter but higher-tech Ultra Skelly ($279), which has a light-up ribcage, voice effects, motion-activated animations, and Bluetooth support. Users can have it play recorded messages or control it in real time from their smartphone. Horowitz told Mashable it's the item she's \"probably most excited about\" because the Halloween market hasn't seen such technology before.\n\"He's completely customizable, so you can speak into him live and really spook your trick-or-treaters on Halloween,\" she explained. \"You can customize his lights and motion. He has 18 different eyes [settings], so really perfect for any party \u2014 Halloween, New Year's. He's kind of a year-round fixture, so I'm really excited about him.\"\nSkelly also got some new pets this year, including a five-foot-tall, Doberman-style Sitting Skelly's Dog with moving LCD \"LifeEyes\" ($249) and a frisky five-foot-long Skelly's Cat ($199). The Home Depot received a lot of requests for the latter specifically, Horowitz said. They're being sold alongside last year's megapopular seven-foot-long Skelly's Dog ($199), which is available again as part of an online-only restock.\nThe Home Depot has also launched a new arboraceous \"Gruesome Grounds\" collection that includes the Worricrow and Gally-Crow, two light-up, motion-activated 15-footers with 12-foot arm spans \u2014 its largest animatronics yet. They're both priced at $399, and the Gally-Crow is an online exclusive.\nOther new additions include an eight-foot-wide Wyvern with color-changing lights ($399); an eight-foot talking troll named Tumble ($249); 3.5-foot Scarred Chucky and Tiffany Valentine dolls ($229 each), as seen in the 1998 movie Bride of Chucky; and a 6.5-foot Bride of Frankenstein animatronic ($279) to go with the seven-foot Frankenstein's Monster ($279), a 2024 release that's returned.\nTumble and Mrs. Frankenstein were two of the first to go during Monday morning's launch, selling out in about an hour.\nA few familiar faces will not be back this year. That includes the 12-foot Inferno Pumpkin Skeleton, which was sold alongside Skelly from 2021 to 2024, as well as last year's Inferno Deadwood Skeleton and motorized Servo Skelly. A Home Depot rep told Mashable that they could return down the road.\nHappy belated Summerween\nAugust might seem premature for a Halloween drop, but it's extremely late by the Home Depot's standards. From 2022 to 2024, the retailer launched select props and animatronics in April as part of a Halfway to Halloween sale before releasing its complete lineup in mid-July. That spring sale was canceled for 2025.\nThe decision was cause for serious concern among the Home Depot's Facebook fandoms, as Mashable previously reported. Many members theorized that the retailer's usual programming was thwarted by President Donald Trump's tariffs on imported goods from China. Skelly and other Home Depot animatronics are made there by a California company called Seasonal Visions International (SVI).\nThe Home Depot wouldn't confirm that tariffs directly impacted its Halfway to Halloween event. The company told Mashable in June that its past iterations were meant as a \"surprise and delight moment\" for its Halloween superfans and that \"it's not necessarily a core part of our strategy.\" However, our investigation found that tariffs had a ripple effect on the Halloween industry this spring.\nSome of the Home Depot's competitors wound up postponing or cancelling their own Halloween drops due to economic turmoil. And for its part, SVI ended its free replacement part program, reduced its overall parts availability, and closed its support lines in July, citing \"changes in tariffs and the global supply chain shifts\" in a note on its website.\nIn curating its 2025 Halloween collection amid tariff challenges, Horowitz said the Home Depot has prioritized customer value and new innovations.\n\"[Something that's] really important to the program is being able to meet customers' expectations on the program that we've had year over year,\" she said. \"So in terms of pricing, I am confident that our values are not going to be beat in the market. ... We're going to have both of our collections really fully stocked.\"\nUPDATE: Aug. 4, 2025, 8:34 a.m. EDT This story has been updated to note that the eight-foot Tumble the troll and 6.5-foot Bride of Frankenstein animatronics have both sold out.\nUPDATE: Aug. 4, 2025, 6:42 a.m. EDT This story has been updated to reflect that the Home Depot's 2025 Halloween drop is now live.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThe Home Depot's 2025 Halloween collection doesn't have an official in-store release day, but \"[most] stores will be set by early September,\" the retailer said on X. \"Exact dates may vary.\" In previous years, items have been available in stores by Labor Day at the very latest.\nHaley Henschel is a Chicago-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable who reviews and finds deals on popular tech, from laptops to gaming consoles and VPNs.
