      "feedback": "Strong start, but to reach world‑class, rewrite as a tight, testable 0–3 week map with explicit causal links, numbers, and triggers rather than a broad synthesis. Edits: 1) Reframe as a crisp 0–3 week chain: immediate drivers (Lagarde’s central‑bank independence warning; U6HXAJR4J) feed into near‑term policy risk premia; tariff pass‑through and U.S./global inflation signals (S15934PBQ) create a wage/price backdrop that can shift Fed/ECB pacing; domestic discretionary demand signals from Vegas prices (6OOEK8TUR) suggest near‑term consumption softness; data prints (CPI/PCE, payrolls) through Jackson Hole window will confirm or invalidate the base case; cite each link (U6HXAJR4J, S15934PBQ, 6OOEK8TUR). 2) Quantify and anchor claims: specify tariff level (15% auto tariffs now; 27.5% previously) and cite Toyota’s NA operating income swing (S15934PBQ); quote Vegas price examples (Diet Coke $15, water $26, nachos $40) as concrete discretionary‑spending stress signals (6OOEK8TUR); note BeeStation Plus price/8 TB as evidence of resilient hardware demand (8VMO3PFEO, S15934PBQ). 3) Structure as a bases and two near‑term scenarios with thresholds: Base: credibility holds (ECB/FOMC rhetoric consistent with gradual normalization; inflation remains manageable) and risk assets stay supported; Upside/Downside: (a) inflation surprise from tariff pass‑through triggers a hawkish repricing; (b) credibility erosion or a sharper domestic demand deterioration triggers risk‑off and multiple compression. For each, specify trigger levels (e.g., CPI/PCE print deviation, ECB/FOMC guidance shift) and invalidate points. 4) Replace or justify peripheral material: drop or tightly link the long tech/NAS reviews (BeeStation/TP‑Link content) to a micro symmetry note only if you explicitly argue that hardware demand is a counterweight to services inflation; otherwise compress or omit to sharpen focus (8VMO3PFEO). 5) Strengthen the reaction function prose: articulate transfer to FX, rate curves, and equity multiples via a causality ladder (credibility → risk premia → asset prices) with explicit path and limits; attach citations after each causal claim. 6) Monitoring and thresholds: list next data prints and policy signals to watch (CPI/PCE, payrolls, tariff announcements, ECB/Fed communications) with anticipated market reactions and a one‑paragraph invalidation line if credibility or inflation readings misalign (U6HXAJR4J)(S15934PBQ)(6OOEK8TUR)(8VMO3PFEO). 7) Tighten prose and format to a concise, single‑pass narrative: remove repetition, ensure every assertion has a source, and end with a clear, cited watchlist.",
