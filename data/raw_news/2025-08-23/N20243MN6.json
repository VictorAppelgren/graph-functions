  "description": "Bolivia\u2019s Supreme Court on Friday ordered judges to urgently review whether three prominent right-wing leaders had been held in prison for too long without trials, threatening to reopen a tumultuous chapter in Bolivia\u2019s politics just days after a presidential election ended two decades of dominance by the governing leftist party.",
  "content": "LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) \u2014 Bolivia\u2019s Supreme Court on Friday ordered judges to urgently review whether three prominent right-wing leaders had been held in prison for too long without trials, threatening to reopen a tumultuous chapter in Bolivia\u2019s politics just days after a presidential election ended two decades of dominance by the governing leftist party.\n\nBolivia\u2019s Chief Justice Romer Saucedo gave judges 24 hours to scrutinize the length of pretrial detention in high-profile cases stemming from the crisis over the 2019 ouster of former President Evo Morales, Bolivia\u2019s first Indigenous president, according to a copy of the document obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe order, experts say, could pave the way for the release from custody of three of Bolivia\u2019s most divisive right-wing politicians: Former interim leader Jeanine A\u00f1ez, former governor Luis Fernando Camacho and his former running mate, Marco Antonio Pumari.\n\nAfter his contested reelection to an unprecedented fourth term in 2019 set off mass protests, Morales stepped down under pressure from the military, paving the way for A\u00f1ez, a previously little-known senator and staunch Christian, to assume office as interim leader.\n\nAs president, A\u00f1ez oversaw a brutal crackdown by security forces on civilian protesters and stifled dissent, with at least 37 people being killed in the postelection violence.\n\nA year after new elections in 2020 vaulted to power current President Luis Arce, Morales\u2019 handpicked successor from his long-ruling Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party, A\u00f1ez was arrested on charges of terrorism and sedition, among other offenses tied to Morales\u2019 2019 ouster which his supporters view as a coup.\n\nIn 2022, A\u00f1ez was sentenced to 10 years in prison on charges of breaching her duties and violating Bolivia\u2019s constitution but faces at least seven other open criminal cases covering a range of charges, including her involvement in the killings of protesters.\n\nA\u00f1ez appealed the sentence and contested the other charges, arguing that she should only be judged in a special impeachment process for former presidents that requires authorization from two-thirds of Congress before any trial can proceed. She is currently being tried as an ordinary citizen.\n\nCamacho, a close ally of A\u00f1ez, has been in pretrial detention since his arrest in late 2022 while leading a strike against Arce\u2019s government in the country\u2019s business hub of Santa Cruz. He was detained on suspicion of terrorism and insurrection over his role in 2019 leading mass protests against Morales\u2019 re-election.\n\nPumari, who ran as Camacho\u2019s running mate in the 2020 elections against Arce, was also arrested on charges related to his involvement in Morales\u2019 removal from power and has been held in pretrial detention since 2021.\n\nIn Bolivia, critics say the courts have become a political prize to control rather than an impartial arbiter.\n\nWhen A\u00f1ez came to power, she charged Morales, then in self-exile, with sedition and terrorism even as evidence was lacking.\n\nWhen Arce came to power, he oversaw the arrests of A\u00f1ez, Camacho and Pumari, raising concerns among international watchdogs that he, too, was using the courts to target his adversaries.\n\nNow, some see the judiciary\u2019s abrupt move to reexamine the cases as similarly motivated by politics.\n\nFriday\u2019s directive comes just days after Bolivia took a lurch to the right in presidential and parliamentary elections.\n\nA runoff election on Oct. 19 will pit a centrist senator, Rodrigo Paz, against a right-wing populist former president, Jorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga, marking a stunning defeat for the MAS party after 20 years of hegemony.\n\nQuiroga, who captured second place, has promised that, if elected, he would not only free his political allies, including \u00c1\u00f1ez and Camacho, but also ensure the arrest of Morales, now holed up in his stronghold in the jungle of Chapare evading an arrest warrant on charges related to his alleged sexual relationship with a 16-year-old girl.\n\n\u201cI believe he is trying to sympathize with the changing political times,\u201d Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez Veltz\u00e9, a former chief justice of the Supreme Court, said of the judge who released the directive.\n\n\u201cThis decision reflects a careless and irresponsible handling of the authority of the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nThe three opposition figures and their legal representatives welcomed Friday\u2019s order as a possible first step toward freedom after years in custody.\n\n\u201cIt is not a triumph, it is a reparation; it is not a gift, it is a right,\u201d \u00c1\u00f1ez wrote on social media. \u201cAlthough late, I receive it with joy and faith that justice now gives hope to all Bolivians.\u201d\n\nCamacho\u2019s lawyer, Mart\u00edn Camacho, told reporters he was informed that courts would begin their review of the case as soon as Saturday, opening a \u201cway for Camacho to recover his freedom.\u201d\n\nPumari criticized his own pretrial detention as \u201ccorrupt justice\u201d in a post on social media Friday that celebrated news of the court order.\n\n\u201cCorporate groups of some judges, prosecutors, and lawyers collude to profit from the pain of the families of those deprived of liberty,\u201d he wrote.\n\nPumari\u2019s lawyer reported that he would be transferred from a prison in southern Bolivia to the country\u2019s capital of La Paz this weekend pending a hearing on his release.",

The move follows a turbulent political history marked by Evo Morales\u2019s ouster in 2019, A\u00f1ez\u2019s violent crackdown, and subsequent arrests of opposition figures by President Luis Arce\u2019s administration. Critics argue the judiciary is being used for political ends, while supporters see the directive as a step toward justice. The decision comes amid a shift to the right in recent elections and a looming runoff that could further reshape Bolivia\u2019s political landscape.",
