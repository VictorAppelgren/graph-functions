  "content": "Sprinter Sha\u2019Carri Richardson addressed her recent domestic violence arrest in a video on social media and issued an apology to her boyfriend Christian Coleman. Richardson posted a video on her Instagram account Monday night in which she said she put herself in a \u201ccompromised situation.\u201d She issued a written apology to Coleman on Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cI love him & to him I can\u2019t apologize enough,\u201d the reigning 100-meter world champion wrote in all capital letters on Instagram, adding that her apology \u201cshould be just as loud\u201d as her \u201cactions.\u201d\n\nRichardson was arrested July 27 on a fourth-degree domestic violence offense for allegedly assaulting Coleman at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. She was booked into South Correctional Entity in Des Moines, Washington, for more than 18 hours.\n\nHer arrest was days before she ran the 100 meters at the U.S. championships in Eugene, Oregon.\n\nIn the video, Richardson said she\u2019s practicing \u201cself-reflection\u201d and refuses \u201cto run away but face everything that comes to me head on.\u201d\n\nAccording to the police report, an officer at the airport was notified by a Transportation Security Administration supervisor of a disturbance between Richardson and her boyfriend, Coleman, the 2019 world 100-meter champion.\n\nThe officer reviewed camera footage and observed Richardson reach out with her left arm and grab Coleman\u2019s backpack and yank it away. Richardson then appeared to get in Coleman\u2019s way with Coleman trying to step around her. Coleman was shoved into a wall.\n\nLater in the report, it said Richardson appeared to throw an item at Coleman, with the TSA indicating it may have been headphones.\n\nThe officer said in the report: \u201cI was told Coleman did not want to participate any further in the investigation and declined to be a victim.\u201d\n\nRichardson wrote that Coleman \u201ccame into my life & gave me more than a relationship but a greater understanding of unconditional love from what I\u2019ve experienced in my past.\u201d\n\nShe won the 100 at the 2023 world championships in Budapest and finished with the silver at the Paris Games last summer. She also helped the 4x100 relay to an Olympic gold.\n\nShe didn\u2019t compete during the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 following a positive marijuana test at the U.S. Olympic trials.",

On Thursday, she ran in the opening round of the women\u2019s 100 meters at U.S. track and field championships in Eugene, Oregon. She has an automatic bye to the world championships in September in Tokyo as the defending champion.\nThe 25-year-old Richardson was booked into the South Correctional Entity (SCORE) in Des Moines, Washington, at 6:54 p.m. last Sunday and released Monday at 1:13 p.m.\n\u201cUSATF is aware of the reports and is not commenting on this matter,\u201d USA Track and Field said in a statement.\nRichardson\u2019s agent did not immediately reply to an email request for comment.\nThe police report said an officer at the airport was notified by a Transportation Security Administration supervisor of a disturbance between Richardson and her boyfriend, sprinter Christian Coleman.\nThe officer reviewed camera footage and observed Richardson reach out with her left arm and grab Coleman\u2019s backpack and yank it away.

      "text": "Richardson will miss Olympic 100 after marijuana test\nAmerican champion Sha\u2019Carri Richardson cannot run in the Olympic 100-meter race after testing positive for a chemical found in marijuana.\nRichardson, who won the 100 at Olympic trials in 10.86 seconds on June 19, spoke of her ban Friday on the \u201cToday\u201d show. She tested positive at the Olympic trials and so her result is erased. Fourth-place finisher Jenna Prandini is expected to get Richardson\u2019s spot in the 100.\nRichardson accepted a 30-day suspension that ends July 27, which would be in time to run in the women\u2019s relays. USA Track and Field has not disclosed plans for the relay.\nThe 21-year-old sprinter was expected to face Jamaica\u2019s Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce in one of the most highly anticipated races of the Olympic track meet.\nOn Thursday, as reports swirled about her possible marijuana use, Richardson put out a tweet that said, simply: \u201cI am human.\u201d On Friday, she went on TV and said she smoked marijuana as a way of coping with her mother\u2019s recent death.\n\u201cI was definitely triggered and blinded by emotions, blinded by badness, and hurting, and hiding hurt,\u201d she told NBC. \u201cI know I can\u2019t hide myself, so in some type of way, I was trying to hide my pain.\u201d\nRichardson had what could have been a three-month sanction reduced to one month because she participated in a counseling program.\nAfter the London Olympics, international regulators relaxed the threshold for what constitutes a positive test for marijuana from 15 nanograms per milliliter to 150 ng/m. They explained the new threshold was an attempt to ensure that in-competition use is detected and not use during the days and weeks before competition.\nThough there have been wide-ranging debates about whether marijuana should be considered a performance-enhancing drug, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency makes clear on its website that \u201call synthetic and naturally occurring cannabinoids are prohibited in-competition, except for cannabidiol (CBD),\u201d a byproduct that is being explored for possible medical benefits.\nWhile not weighing in on her prospects for the relays, USATF issued a statement that said her \u201csituation is incredibly unfortunate and devastating for everyone involved.\u201d The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee said it was \u201cworking with USATF to determine the appropriate next steps.\u201d\nRichardson said if she\u2019s allowed to run in the relay, \u201cI\u2019m grateful, but if not, I\u2019m just going to focus on myself.\u201d\nHer case is the latest in a number of doping-related embarrassments for U.S. track team. Among those banned for the Olympics are the reigning world champion at 100 meters, Christian Coleman, who is serving a suspension for missing tests, and the American record holder at 1,500 and 5,000 meters, Shelby Houlihan, who tested positive for a performance enhancer she blamed on tainted meat in a burrito. Also on Friday, defending Olympic 100-meter hurdles champion Brianna McNeal had a five-year ban for tampering or attempted tampering with the doping-control process upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\nNow, Richardson is out as well, denying the Olympics of a much-hyped race and an electric personality. She ran at the trials with flowing orange hair and long fingernails.\n\u201cTo put on a face and go out in front of the world and hide my pain, who am I to tell you how to cope when you\u2019re dealing with pain and struggles you\u2019ve never had to experience before?\u201d Richardson said.\n___\nMore AP Olympics coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/2020-tokyo-olympics"
