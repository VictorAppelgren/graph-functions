      "feedback": "The draft cleanly articulates a regime‑based macro transmission but it lacks a crisp, testable causal map, consistent cross‑asset regime wiring, and explicit invalidation triggers; it also over‑reaches on some numbers without consistently anchoring them to sources or reconciling minor conflicts across sources. Actionable edits: (1) replace the broad narrative with a single, explicit causal chain: inflation normalization and policy easing drive lower discount rates and tighter financial conditions easing risk premia, which lift equities/crypto AI‑financing and support a multi‑year EV capex re‑rating; thresholds should hinge on observable regime shifts (wage growth momentum, inflation persistence, Jackson Hole signals) and a defined capex cadence; attach after every link a sourced anchor (OGK8WLL69, Y6SQOEK69, T1QE6JPIX). (2) fix regime mapping and probabilities into a unified, coverable framework you can test: for example, Euro area Regime A/B/C ≈ 50/30/20 and global oil Regimes A/B/C at 50/30/20 with explicit price implications (Brent mid‑60s, WTI low‑60s in Regime A; cite T1QE6JPIX); clearly state assumptions and resolve any conflicts between sources (R3WNA7L7A vs NL5YYTLF2). (3) compress and quantify the macro/market links with precise numbers: 2025 ACMR revenue midpoint ≈ $900m; gross margin ≈ 4%; Ford EV losses ≈ $1.3B with adj. EBIT ≈ 4.3% and ROIC ≈ 10.1% (22PL3Q360); oil regime expectations and refinery runs near all‑time highs (85.6 mbpd 2025; 83.6–84.0 2025–26 as in T1QE6JPIX); 2025 Brent/WTI anchors; 2025 US tokenization ~$4.2B and RWA ≈ $16T by 2030 (JPAIHPA4N, SGB2PAZGK); ensure every number is presented with its source immediately after the claim. (4) strengthen scenario structure: present a concise base case with two alt paths (Bull: earlier inflation relief and policy ease; Bear: inflation persistence or energy/shadow regime shocks), plus explicit watch‑list triggers and invalidation tests: CPI MoM 0.30–0.40% prints failing to ease; oil regime probability shifts by ±15–20 percentage points; semiconductor capex cadence disappoints; crypto/private‑credit flows stall (cite Y6SQOEK69, T1QE6JPIX, OGK8WLL69). (5) sharpen the “watch‑list” into decisive signals and timing, not vibes: CPI momentum prints, oil regime reassessments (T1QE6JPIX), Jackson Hole communications, ACMR 2025 revenue trajectory, 2025 EV capex/ margin cadence (22PL3Q360), and RWA/tokenization milestones (JPAIHPA4N, SGB2PAZGK). (6) improve readability and tighten language to remove hedges and generic phrasing; after each section, place a tight mapping to the corresponding source IDs to demonstrate coverage and resolve any minor conflicts; ensure every critical claim has a source tag (as in OGK8WLL69, T1QE6JPIX, 22PL3Q360, JPAIHPA4N, SGB2PAZGK, R3WNA7L7A, NL5YYTLF2, Y6SQOEK69).",
