      "feedback": "The draft violates several core rules: it repeats the same “Up/Down” lines, lacks a strict 4‑line format, and mixes trade‑plan and outlook text without clear separation; it also fails to map to canonical handles (e.g., DXY, ust10y, us_pce) with explicit signs, and it omits a dated catalyst window for each scenario. To upgrade, rewrite the Movers & Scenarios section into exactly four lines—two “Up” and two “Down”—each with the required syntax: `Up | 3‑6 mo | Fed cut + sticky inflation + risk‑off flows (B1KYJ1GPU) | CPI 2.7% + Fed minutes + tariff policy (XTQIQRP5K) | 80%`. Ensure each driver references a canonical handle (e.g., `fed_policy`, `us_inflation`) and includes a specific catalyst date (e.g., “Fed meeting 25 Sep 2025”). Remove redundant explanatory prose, keep only the concise lines. Then produce a single Swing Trade line for DXY: `Up | 3‑6 mo | 0.5%–1% above current (B1KYJ1GPU) | 1% below current (B1KYJ1GPU) | 2% above current (B1KYJ1GPU) | 2:1 (B1KYJ1GPU) | CPI >2.7% or Fed pause (XTQIQRP5K) | Fed cut confirmation (B1KYJ1GPU) | 80% (B1KYJ1GPU) | 85`. Replace the placeholder “1% below current” with an actual entry price (e.g., `Entry 95.8` if DXY is 95.8), a stop (e.g., `Stop 94.8`), and a target (e.g., `Target 97.5`). Ensure all numbers are sourced (e.g., `95.8` from `LF0UUL917`). Finally, delete any narrative that drifts from the asset or lacks a causal link; every sentence must reference a handle and a catalyst with an inline ID. This will satisfy the acceptance gate and produce a concise, actionable swing‑trade outlook.",
