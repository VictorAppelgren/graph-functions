  "content": "\u2022 Institutions' substantial holdings in NWF Group implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\n\u2022 The top 16 shareholders own 51% of the company\n\u2022 Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of NWF Group plc (LON:NWF), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 63% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of NWF Group, beginning with the chart below.\n\nSee our latest analysis for NWF Group\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NWF Group?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nNWF Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NWF Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in NWF Group. Our data shows that TrinityBridge Limited is the largest shareholder with 7.4% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 5.2% and 4.8% of the stock.\n\nLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 16 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.",

      "text": "Results\n22\nMidstream oil and gas companies, specifically pipeline operators, are well-positioned to benefit from Trump\u2019s executive orders on fossil fuels enacted in early 2025. \u2013 \u2013 These policies aim to accelerate infrastructure development by streamlining environmental reviews and permitting processes, such as those under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling. Pipelines and storage facilities will be critical to moving larger volumes of oil and gas efficiently, especially with the renewed emphasis on LNG exports to meet global demand.\n22 companies\nChevron\nMarket Cap: US$321.0b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in the integrated energy and chemicals operations in the United States and internationally.\nCVX\nUS$158.18\n7D\n1.0%\n1Y\n7.2%\nWilliams Companies\nMarket Cap: US$69.7b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States.\nWMB\nUS$57.07\n7D\n1.0%\n1Y\n25.5%\nKinder Morgan\nMarket Cap: US$59.3b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in North America.\nKMI\nUS$26.70\n7D\n1.8%\n1Y\n24.6%\nCheniere Energy\nMarket Cap: US$52.2b\nAn energy infrastructure company, primarily engages in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) related businesses in the United States.\nLNG\nUS$237.56\n7D\n3.2%\n1Y\n29.1%\nMarathon Petroleum\nMarket Cap: US$52.0b\nOperates as an integrated downstream energy company in the United States.\nMPC\nUS$170.88\n7D\n5.3%\n1Y\n-2.5%\nONEOK\nMarket Cap: US$47.1b\nOperates as a midstream service provider of gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage, and marine export services in the United States.\nOKE\nUS$74.84\n7D\n2.5%\n1Y\n-15.5%\nDT Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$10.3b\nProvides integrated natural gas services in the United States.\nDTM\nUS$101.66\n7D\n-0.3%\n1Y\n33.4%\nHess Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.7b\nOwns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream assets and provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers in the United States.\nHESM\nUS$41.45\n7D\n1.4%\n1Y\n10.4%\nAntero Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.5b\nOwns, operates, and develops midstream energy assets in the Appalachian Basin.\nAM\nUS$17.70\n7D\n0.9%\n1Y\n19.8%\nKinetik Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$6.6b\nThrough its subsidiaries, operates as a midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin.\nKNTK\nUS$40.70\n7D\n1.7%\n1Y\n-5.9%\nPBF Energy\nMarket Cap: US$2.8b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in refining and supplying petroleum products.\nPBF\nUS$24.32\n7D\n2.5%\n1Y\n-27.1%\nRattler Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$2.2b\nRattler Midstream LP owns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream and energy-related infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.\nRTLR\nUS$15.22\n7D\n3.5%\n1Y\n45.0%\nPar Pacific Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.6b\nOperates as an energy company in the United States.\nPARR\nUS$31.20\n7D\n4.1%\n1Y\n43.1%\nDelek US Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.5b\nEngages in the integrated downstream energy business in the United States.\nDK\nUS$24.47\n7D\n6.9%\n1Y\n19.0%\nClean Energy Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$554.8m\nOffers natural gas as alternative fuels for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions in the United States and Canada.\nCLNE\nUS$2.53\n7D\n4.1%\n1Y\n-21.7%\nOPAL Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$397.1m\nEngages in the production and distribution of renewable natural gas (RNG) for use as a vehicle fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets throughout the United States.\nOPAL\nUS$2.29\n7D\n0%\n1Y\n-37.6%\nSummit Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$253.2m\nFocuses on owning, developing, and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets primarily shale formations in the continental United States.\nSMC\nUS$20.68\n7D\n3.6%\n1Y\n-43.9%\nGranite Falls Energy\nMarket Cap: US$91.1m\nEngages in the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products in the continental United States.\nGFGY\nUS$2,975.00\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a\nStabilis Solutions\nMarket Cap: US$76.2m\nAn energy transition company, provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation, and fueling solutions primarily using liquefied natural gas (LNG) to various end markets in North America.\nSLNG\nUS$4.10\n7D\n2.8%\n1Y\n-0.1%\nVivakor\nMarket Cap: US$38.7m\nOperates, acquires, and develops technologies and assets in the oil and gas industry in the United States and Kuwait.\nVIVK\nUS$0.82\n7D\n-1.3%\n1Y\n-56.6%\nMirage Energy\nMarket Cap: US$1.3m\nThrough its subsidiaries, focuses on developing an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States.\nMRGE\nUS$0.0025\n7D\n78.6%\n1Y\n-75.0%\nEnergtek\nMarket Cap: US$51.4k\nProvides natural gas delivery solutions based on mobile pipe-less technologies and products.\nEGTK\nUS$0.0001\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a"

  "argos_summary": "NWF Group plc, a UK fuel oil distributor, is heavily owned by institutions (63%) with the top 16 shareholders holding 51% of the shares, giving them significant influence over the company\u2019s direction. The firm reported 2025 earnings of \u00a36.2\u202fm on revenue of \u00a3903\u202fm, a modest gross margin of 5.6% and a low debt\u2011to\u2011equity ratio of 5.3%, while maintaining a reliable dividend of \u00a30.071 per share. Analyst coverage is limited, and the stock has underperformed the UK oil and gas sector over the past year, though its volatility remains low. Recent updates highlight strategic M&A and operational efficiencies in the fuels division, and the company\u2019s future growth is projected at 12% earnings and 7.3% revenue annually, though still below UK market averages. The broader context includes Trump\u2019s 2025 executive orders boosting midstream infrastructure, which could indirectly benefit NWF\u2019s supply chain and distribution network.",
