      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid narrative but falls short of the world‑class depth and rigor required for a multi‑year structural analysis. Add explicit first‑principles anchors (e.g., real‑rate differentials, trade‑policy shocks, and the Fed’s reaction function) and tie them to the EV and AI sectors: e.g., “Fed hikes → higher real rates → tighter credit → higher EV component costs; tariff escalation → higher import duties on battery cells → cost premium for Rivian.” Specify regimes and transition conditions (Tesla’s high‑margin niche → declining volume; Rivian’s cost‑reduction regime → R2 launch → volume‑driven margin expansion). Quantify every claim with source IDs: Rivian’s $7.5 B cash, $6.6 B DOE loan, R2 price $45 k, Tesla’s gross margin 17.9% (P0K0UEOHU), Amazon’s AWS revenue $130.5 B 2024, margin 17% EBITDA (BAAVVG964), Shopify’s 31% revenue growth Q2 (BAAVVG964), HealthStream’s ROE 5.8% (EETJ5BIEJ), dividend yields (QZXKE5CBL). Explicitly list catalysts and invalidation points: tariff escalation, AI valuation correction, Humira patent cliff, supply‑chain bottlenecks. Reconcile conflicting signals (Tesla’s margin squeeze vs. Amazon’s AI‑driven margin lift) by noting the different cost structures. End with a concise base‑case, key risks, watch list, and confidence rating, citing the relevant IDs for each point. This will elevate the analysis to a coherent, data‑driven, first‑principles framework that meets the section focus.",
