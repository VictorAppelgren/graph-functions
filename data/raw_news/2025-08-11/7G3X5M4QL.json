  "title": "How to Move Mac Apps to Your Menu Bar (and Why You Should)",
  "description": "Badgeify lets you add any Mac app to the menu bar, including app folders, so you can keep multiple apps there without wasting screen space.",
  "content": "I live in a small, cramped apartment in a big city. For each item I bring into my house, I feel like I need to throw something out to keep clutter from piling up. In some ways, my battle with my MacBook's limited screen real estate mirrors my space issues at home. As a tech journalist, installing apps is a daily occurrence for me, which means an overcrowded dock or menu bar.\n\nLuckily, I've largely solved my menu bar issues on my Mac, but my dock is still an area of concern. It's full of apps, and even though I've moved it around a few times, it still takes up too much space on my 13-inch laptop screen. It's gotten so bad that I've now switched to automatically hiding the dock (under System Settings > Desktop & Dock). There's just one problem\u2014I still need to be able to access the apps I was keeping on my dock. Luckily, with some tweaking, it's easy to move apps from my chaotic dock to my organized menu bar. Here's how.\n\nAdding any app to the Mac's menu bar\n\nIf an app doesn't offer a menu bar icon (looking at you, Slack!), then by default, macOS doesn't let you move it there. That's where Badgeify comes in. It lets you add any app to the Mac's menu bar, where these apps will act as they would in the dock. You can click their menu bar icons to open them (or navigate to their active window), or right-click their icons to reveal additional features (when available).\n\nOnce you've installed Badgeify, you need to give it accessibility permissions, although that's standard for apps that make changes to the menu bar. The app will then directly open to its settings page, with the General tab selected by default. Click the + button in the Icons section to start adding your favorite apps to your menu bar. The free tier lets you add three apps to the menu bar, but there is a trick you can use to add just one more.\n\nTo add more apps to your menu bar, you can alternatively group multiple apps in a folder and add that to the menu bar instead. Clicking the folder icon in the menu bar will show the apps inside it in a drop down menu. Unfortunately, the free tier is only limited to one folder, and that folder can only have up to two apps in it. With the two standard app icons you can add in addition to that folder, that gives you four free menu bar apps in total. The paid version, however, lifts these restrictions.\n\nIf you like what you see with the free tier, you can pay $9 to unlock all features on one Mac or $16 to use the app on up to three Macs. This removes the limits on the number of apps and folders you can add to the menu bar, as well as how many apps a folder can have inside it. It also, delightfully, unlocks some customization options.\n\nAmong these features, the most useful one for me is the ability to hide an app from the menu bar when it has no notifications. For instance, if you add Messages to the menu bar, you can keep it hidden until someone messages you. This way, if the app's icon is there, you know you have a message to read. You can find this feature over at Badgeify settings > Advanced.\n\nIt also lets you customize how an app's menu bar icon looks, which is great for me because I prefer monochrome icons in the menu bar. Although, if you're feeling creative, you can add your own custom app icons instead. This feature is available under Badgeify settings > General. Click the i button next to an app's name to start customizing it.\n\nThere's also one experimental feature called Application Integration in Badgeify's Advanced settings page. This only works with browsers at the moment, and makes it so that when you add a browser to the menu bar, you can right-click its icon to reveal a list of all open tabs. This makes it easier to quickly switch to a specific browser tab, which could speed up your workflow.\n\nOverall, though, I love Badgeify, and it's been well worth the cost for me. I've used this app to move Slack, Messages, WhatsApp, and my email client (FMail) to the menu bar, which makes it a lot easier to live without the dock on my screen, meaning I can happily maximize my available screen space.",

      "url": "https://lifehacker.com/tech/14-ways-to-customize-your-macs-dock",
      "text": "The dock, an iconic Mac feature, is used to launch apps, switch between them, and as a hub for displaying key apps and minimized windows while they're open. By default, the dock has a clean look and features a few apps that your computer thinks you might want to use. However, you can get a lot out of customizing your dock, like removing the icons for default Apple apps you don't use. You can also change its placement and its look. Here's what you need to know to do just that, plus a bit extra.\nRemove apps you're not going to use\nYou should start your dock tweaks by removing apps you're never going to use. To remove an app from your dock, right-click it and select Options > Remove from Dock. You can also ensure apps that are only in the dock temporarily (which appear on the right side of the dock, next to a separator) stay there by right-clicking them and selecting Options > Keep in Dock.\nMove apps around to make them easy to access\nYour next step should be to reorder your Dock's apps, which is as simple dragging their icons where you want them. Note, though, that if you accidentally drop an icon outside of the dock, it'll be removed from your dock and you'll have to add it again.\nChange the size of the dock\nYou can also adjust your dock's size. Hover your mouse cursor over any of your dock's separators (those vertical dividing lines). The cursor will change to an arrow that points up and down. Drag it towards the top of the screen to make the dock larger or drag it downwards to make it smaller.\nAlternatively, you can adjust the dock\u2019s size by clicking the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's screen and going to System Settings > Desktop & Dock and moving the Size slider.\nChange the dock\u2019s position\nThe dock can be moved to either side of your screen, saving you precious real estate. To change this, right-click any vacant area in the dock and select Position on Screen. Pick Left or Right to align your dock vertically to your selected position. Center will place it back in the default spot.\nThis option is also available in System Settings > Desktop & Dock > Position on screen.\nAutomatically hide and show the dock\nSome of us prefer to have a clean workspace, and if that's you, you can auto-hide the dock when it's not in use. It won't be gone entirely, but it'll only make itself visible when you move the cursor towards its location. This is also a good feature for those with limited screen space. Enable this feature by going to System Settings > Desktop & Dock > Automatically hide & show the dock. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Command-Option-D to toggle this setting on and off.\nRemove recently opened apps from the dock\nThe right side of your dock will show your most recently opened apps. If this annoys you, you can disable the setting by going to System Settings > Desktop & Dock and disabling Show suggested and recent apps in Dock. I prefer this feature on, to help me navigate commonly used apps, but if you're short on screen space, it could be useful.\nMove minimized windows into the app icon\nWhenever you minimize apps on your Mac, each window appears as a separate icon on the dock. This can cause the dock to fill up fast, automatically making it smaller. If you\u2019d rather avoid this, macOS allows you to minimize windows directly into the appropriate app icon instead. Just go to System Settings > Desktop & Dock and select Minimize windows into application icon. To access a window that's been minimized into an app icon, right-click it.\nHide indicators for open apps\nIf an app is open on your Mac, a small dot will appear near its icon on the dock. You can remove these open app indicators if you'd like. Go to System Settings > Desktop & Dock and disable Show indicators for open applications.\nCustomize magnification of icons\nWhen you move your cursor near any app icon on your Mac\u2019s dock, it\u2019ll automatically enlarge. You can change the level of this magnification effect, or disable it altogether by going to System Settings > Desktop & Dock.\nTo enable or disable enlarging icons, use the slider below Magnification. Moving the slider all the way to the left switches off magnification, while moving it elsewhere will adjust magnification size. Fun tip: If you have this feature disabled, you can temporarily activate it on command by holding Shift + Control.\nAdd folders to the dock\nYou can add browsable folders to your Mac\u2019s dock, as long as the folder is in the Favorites bar in Finder. Open Finder and locate the folder you want to add and drag it to the Favorites bar in the left pane. Right-click any folder in the Favorites bar and select Add to Dock.\nHere's the fun part: you can use this trick to group a bunch of apps into a single dock icon, which is great when you have a few apps that you want to keep in the dock, but you don't need them every single day. The trick is to go to the Applications folder in Finder and move the apps to a new folder. Just give the folder a name, move it to the Favorites Bar, and add it to the dock. You're all set!\nAdd spacers to the dock\nYou can go a little beyond the options macOS gives you and add a few spacers, or blank spaces, to your dock to help organize it. You can use these blank spaces for aesthetics or to group similar apps. To do this, you'll need to use your Mac's Terminal. Press Command-Space, search for Terminal, and open the app. Then, paste and run the following command to add a full-size spacer in the dock.\ndefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{tile-data={}; tile-type=\"spacer-tile\";}' && killall Dock\nIf you want a smaller spacer, use this command instead.\ndefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{\"tile-type\"=\"small-spacer-tile\";}' && killall Dock\nFor more than one spacer, simply re-run your chosen command. The good news is that this is the only time you'll need the Terminal. Once you have your spacer, simply drag it around to change its position in the dock, or drop it outside the dock to remove it.\nChange app icons to make the dock more visually pleasing\nYou can also customize the dock by simply changing various app icons. This can make it look more pleasant or help it fit a particular theme. The best way to do this is to open your favorite apps and see if they let you change their app icons. If not, check out my guide on replacing macOS app icons, which highlights both a built-in method and one third-party app that makes it easier to change app icons. For alternative icons, a good resource is macOSicons.com.\nUse third-party apps to access hidden dock settings\nYour Mac doesn't always make it easy to find everything you can do with it. Sometimes, you need to run a few Terminal commands to access hidden features (such as the spacers I just highlighted), and even then, some features aren't user-accessible at all. For more control, consider trying Mac apps that unlock these hidden features for you, such as TinkerTool (free) or Supercharge ($11). I've written about TinkerTool before, and my colleague Khamosh Pathak has covered Supercharge. Both apps have a few useful options for tweaking your dock, such as the ability to remove the delay before macOS reveals your hidden dock, or dimming the icons of hidden apps.\nTinkerTool also makes it easier to add spacers to the dock, and it even allows you to lock the dock, so that the positions of icons and spacers can't be changed. Supercharge, meanwhile, has a feature that directly opens dock folders in Finder, instead of showing their contents right in the dock.\nUse a dedicated dock customization app\nIf your goal is only to tweak the dock and nothing else, you may be better-served by a dedicated dock customization app. This type of an app will allow you to make cosmetic and functional changes to the dock, but won't be useful if you want other systemwide tweaks. Two good examples are DockFlow ($5.60) and uBar ($30). DockFlow lets you create presets for your dock. You can think of it like creating various profiles such as work, gaming, education, social media, etc. For each of these presets, you can drop a few apps into them and quickly switch between them as needed. uBar, meanwhile, focuses on making the dock look like the Windows taskbar, which could be useful if you're moving operating systems."

      "text": "As someone whose job involves testing and writing about Mac apps, a crowded menu bar is an occupational hazard. Until its ownership change last year, my go-to recommendation for tidying up your menu bar was Bartender. But once it became clear that we don't really know who owns Bartender now, I tried a few alternatives, and none of them had all the features I was looking for. So, I abandoned menu bar managers until recently, when the apps in my menu bar began extending more than halfway into my screen and I was finding it hard to even locate which app I was looking for.\nThat's when I discovered Barbee, a powerful menu bar manager for Mac. It can do everything from hiding unnecessary menu bar icons to customizing the shape of your menu bar and even the look of the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your screen.\nThe app is a free download and comes with a three-day free trial for you to try all its features. Note that you won't even get charged automatically at the end of the trial. You'll simply lose access to the app's features, and you can then either pay $7 for a one-time unlock or choose the annual subscription fee of $3. This allows you to try Barbee with no pressure to see if it works for you.\nBarbee requires accessibility and screen recording permissions to allow you to use all its features. These permissions allow the app to show different menu bar layouts and let you set up and run automations, which is an invaluable feature for me. However, if you're worried, know that the app is sandboxed, so it is limited in how much of its data it can access through those permissions.\nChanging menu bar layouts in Barbee\nThe Menu Bar Layout settings page is your best to place to get started in Barbee, since that's where you'll actually arrange which of your menu bar icons are hidden. Here, you can pick which apps you'd like to always see, such as calendar or performance monitoring apps, while moving the rest to the hidden section. There's also an \"Always Hidden\" section, which is great for apps that can't run if they're not in the menu bar. In my case, one of these is Unclack, which mutes the Mac's mic when I'm typing. I need to run this app all the time but I never actually want to see its menu bar icon. The difference? You can temporarily reveal hidden icons when needed, but not Always Hidden ones.\nThis app also has a lot of tweaks available in its settings menu, and I highly recommend going through them all to make the most of it. Under Barbee Settings > General > Mode, for instance, you can choose between Normal Mode and Enhanced Mode. In normal mode, when you reveal hidden icons, the app displays them within the menu bar, right next to the visible icons. But enhanced mode displays them in a small floating menu instead. For those who have a lot of menu bar icons (pretty much the entire target audience for this kind of an app), that is a great feature.\nYou can also customize the menu bar's look and feel in the Menu Bar Appearance section. This lets you change the shape of the menu bar, and you can choose if you want it to have rounded corners, a different tint, and even if you want to use a separated layout where app menus appear in a separate menu bar on the left. I prefer a more unified look, so that's not for me, but I couldn't resist changing the Apple logo to the classic rainbow variant, which is maybe one of my favorite Barbee features.\nAutomation and other options\nBarbee also has an automation section that allows you to show or hide certain menu bar icons based on triggers. The simplest example is the battery widget, which I only really want to see when the battery is low. So, I went to Barbee Settings > Automation and quickly added a new automation to make that happen. You can set up similar triggers with pretty much every menu bar icon, so feel free to set it up according to your needs.\nI also added a custom keyboard shortcut to see hidden menu items, which speeds up my workflow quite a bit. You can do this by going to the Shortcuts section in the app's settings. The General settings page has many other useful options, too. Be sure to enable Launch at login to make the app fire up each time you use your Mac, and also the Extend battery life option to ensure that Barbee doesn't consume an inordinate amount of power. There are also niche, but useful features on this page, such as the ability to show all menu bar icons when you're using an external display. This is nice to have, because my MacBook Air's screen has limited real estate, but when I plug it in to my ultrawide monitor, I don't need to hide any menu bar icons."
