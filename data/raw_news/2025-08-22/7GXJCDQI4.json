  "description": "Krystal Biotech stock maintains Buy rating at H.C. Wainwright on KB707 focus",
  "content": "Investing.com - H.C. Wainwright has reiterated its Buy rating and $240.00 price target on (NASDAQ: ), currently trading at $145.70, following the company\u2019s update on development plans for its oncology program KB707. According to InvestingPro data, analysts maintain a strong bullish consensus with price targets ranging from $166 to $252.\n\nThe biotech firm announced it will prioritize the clinical advancement of the inhaled form of KB707 for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KB707 is a redosable immunotherapy designed to drive sustained, localized expression of interleukin-2 and interleukin-12 in the tumor microenvironment. The company\u2019s strong financial position, with impressive gross profit margins of 93.37% and robust revenue growth of 116% over the last twelve months, supports its ambitious development plans.\n\nInhaled KB707 is currently being evaluated in the open-label multi-center, dose escalation and expansion Phase 1/2 KYANITE study in patients with solid tumors with pulmonary metastases that are relapsed or refractory to standard of care therapy.\n\nAt the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2025 conference, Krystal Biotech reported promising data for inhaled KB707, demonstrating monotherapy activity and durable responses in heavily pre-treated patients, including a 36% objective response rate.\n\nThe company plans to hold an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in the third quarter of 2025 to discuss potential development pathways for inhaled KB707, while enrollment for the OPAL-1 Phase 1 study evaluating the intratumoral delivery form has been paused. For deeper insights into KRYS\u2019s financial health and growth potential, including 10+ additional ProTips and comprehensive valuation analysis, explore the full research report available on InvestingPro.\n\nIn other recent news, Krystal Biotech has reported its second-quarter earnings for 2025, which exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations. The company announced earnings per share of $1.29, surpassing the forecast of $1.22, and reported revenue of $96.04 million, which was above the anticipated $92.24 million. Despite these strong financial results, Krystal Biotech\u2019s management indicated that third-quarter revenue might be lower due to patient pausing trends. In addition, BofA Securities adjusted its price target for Krystal Biotech to $182 from $192, maintaining a Buy rating but expressing concerns about the company\u2019s near-term growth trajectory. Furthermore, Krystal Biotech is advancing its KB707 immunotherapy treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, having secured an End of Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to discuss potential registration pathways. The company is focusing on the development of this inhaled treatment, which aims to enhance immune-mediated tumor clearance. These developments highlight Krystal Biotech\u2019s ongoing efforts in both financial performance and therapeutic advancements.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.
