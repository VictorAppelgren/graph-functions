  "description": "\u201cWe won and that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d Eovaldi said after allowing five runs, including three homers in five innings of work Monday.",
  "content": "ARLINGTON - It was only fair.\n\nNathan Eovaldi has saved the Rangers time and time and time again in this uneven season of offensive unpredictability. The least they could do for him was bail him out for a change. The net deficit will still be insurmountable, but for a team trying to cling to playoff hopes through a stormy start to August, it will do just fine: Rangers 7, Arizona 6 in 10 innings.\n\n\u201cWe won and that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d Eovaldi said after allowing five runs, including three homers in five innings of work Monday due to an unexpectedly erratic splitter and some fastball location issues. \u201cI\u2019ll work on the side to go and figure out everything that I need to work on. But regardless of how well I do out there, it\u2019s about us, about the team winning games, especially with where we are at this point of the season. That\u2019s the only thing that matters.\u201d\n\nThis, of course, may be put to the test. It\u2019s possible Eovaldi sacrificed his burgeoning Cy Young candidacy, built mostly on a historic ERA pace. In return, the Rangers pulled off their biggest comeback win of the season, erasing a five-run deficit heading to the bottom of the sixth.\n\nAlong the way, Wyatt Langford broke out of a month-long power drought to get the Rangers back in the game. Bruce Bochy, sensing the importance or desperation of the moment, turned to his high-leverage relievers despite trailing; they responded by retiring 12 of the last 13 Diamondbacks. Rowdy Tellez imitated Corey Seager\u2019s World Series trick with a game-tying homer in the bottom of the ninth. And Jake Burger, who has recently been reduced to platoon status, delivered a game-winning walkoff single off the left field wall, doing what he hasn\u2019t done at all this year, getting out ahead of a pitch and pulling it in the air.\n\nIt all added up a win that stopped the Rangers four-game losing streak and kept them above .500. Even gained them a little ground on Cleveland, the team directly ahead of them in the wild card standings. The Guardians were off, but a half-game is still a half game.\n\nMost importantly, it perhaps pumped some plasma back into a team that looked as if it was teetering in the last week. Even Bochy acknowledged the importance/desperation of the moment, both with actions and words. The actions: After the Rangers got within a run on Langford\u2019s three-run homer, his first in exactly one month, he turned to a procession of guys who typically pitch only with a lead: Danny Coulombe, Shawn Armstrong, Hoby Milner and Phil Maton.\n\nThe words: \u201cI think it says one thing: That we need to win a ballgame. Normally, I probably wouldn\u2019t do that but this is a game I thought would be really, really big for the club to win. They were fresh and they were good to go and did a really nice job. It was a game that I just felt like once we got so close and with how hard they fought, we needed to do what we can to keep it there. And give us a chance to win.\u201d\n\nAll things considered, it still seemed a bit desperate. The Rangers have not been a team prone to comebacks this season. Until Monday, the biggest deficit they\u2019d overcome to win a game was two runs. They\u2019d done that twice.\n\nEovaldi\u2019s struggles with his splitter led to three homers and two hit batsmen in five innings. It was the first time in his career, he allowed both multiple homers and hit batters in the same start. Entering the game, Eovaldi had allowed only five homers in 111 innings this season, a big reason why his ERA sat at 1.38. When it was all done, it rose to 1.71 for 116 innings. He still has the lowest ERA in the AL among pitchers with at least 100 innings, but his edge over Boston\u2019s Garrett Crochet shrunk. Also: He still falls short of qualifying for the official league leaders.\n\nConsider that his ERA through 19 starts was the fifth-lowest in the 105 years of the \u201cLive Ball Era.\u201d Historic. After 20 starts, 1.71 is merely impressive. There have been 27 other such occurrences.\n\nBut the night wasn\u2019t about what might have been lost individually. Or what might be gained long-term for an offense that has defied explanation all year long. Could it give the Rangers a boost of energy? Sure. Then again, it\u2019s a question that\u2019s been asked over and over after a win ended a stretch of inconsistency.\n\nNo, right now, it\u2019s not about considering the future. It\u2019s about considering the present. The Rangers needed to win a game Monday. They\u2019ll need to win just as badly on Tuesday. And that is likely to be the case every night the rest of the way. What mattered was that they played a game on Monday and won.\n\n\u201cWe all needed this win as a group,\u201d Tellez said, emphasizing \u201call.\u201d \u201cSometimes it happens as a group. Sometimes it\u2019s one guy that does it.\u201d\n\nFor most of the season, when Eovaldi has started, it\u2019s fallen on one guy: Him. On Monday, the group picked him up.\n\nFind more Rangers coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.",

It was the second straight game Tellez started at first.

It is the third lowest among 237 major leaguers with at least 200 plate appearances against right-handers this season. It underscores the all-or-nothing element that is the Rangers\u2019 lineup.\nTellez hasn\u2019t been significantly better at reaching base against right-handers, posting a .268 OBP in 192 plate appearances entering Monday, but he has slugged at a .469 clip to post a .737 OPS against right-handers.\nFind more Rangers coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."

      "text": "ARLINGTON - A Rangers official posed a question Monday: Have all the columns about the ineffectiveness of the offense been exhausted?\nOf topics, the Rangers\u2019 offense has been a prolific producer. Of actual runs: Not so much.\nIt\u2019s been established the Rangers offense struggles against lefties. Also: on the road. Add top-tier pitching, too. Much of that can be explained by pure physical deficiencies or something as easy as playing away from home. What may be most damning about an offense that has become accustomed to profanity is this: The team doesn\u2019t seem to get better as the game progresses.\nWhat it suggests: Either a lack of feel or as president of baseball operations Chris Young once described it earlier this year a lack of \u201cconnectivity.\u201d\nConsider the natural flow of the game. Some teams are hot starters, other are not. But according to league averages, teams see about a 4% increase in run production from the first three innings to the middle three. Pitchers have shown most or all of their repertoire the first time through the order. They may start to fatigue. The advantage moves towards the hitter. Then, when facing high-leverage relievers late in games, it drops off again.\nNot the Rangers. They start out OK enough, ranking 12th in the majors in run scored through the first three innings. Then, when other offenses are figuring things out, they go flat. They have a dropoff of 6% in scoring in innings 4-6 and their 119 total runs from the seventh through the ninth are last in baseball.\nThat sure appeared to be crystal clear over the weekend, when the Rangers scored in the first inning of all three games against Philadelphia, then scored a total of one run after that.\nIt\u2019s what made Monday\u2019s 7-6 comeback win over Arizona such a surprise. The Rangers didn\u2019t start out well, but rallied for four runs in the sixth inning against starter Ryne Nelson to make a game of it. Then they tied it on Rowdy Tellez\u2019s ninth-inning homer. It was the club\u2019s third game-tying, ninth-inning homer this season. All have come in the last 30 days.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s there because I\u2019ve seen it,\u201d co-hitting instructor Bret Boone said Monday. \u201cBut why do we go in these extreme lows? Is it a lack of focus? No, these guys want to win. They want to do well. We do all get caught up in our individual numbers. I\u2019d be lying to you if I always thought, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not worried my number. Let\u2019s just win.\u2019 No, let\u2019s just win. But I want my numbers too. You want to contribute.\n\u201cThe thing that really just grates on me is when we have a runner on third and less than two outs. Let\u2019s get this runner in. I love it when we move the runner. The energy is unbelievable. And I can\u2019t tell you the difference between scoring one run in an inning and two. It\u2019s a world of difference. I can\u2019t say they they\u2019re not capable of making adjustments, but you have a fair point that we\u2019ve gone through streaks during the season - and big streaks - where we tend to take the middle innings off, and now all of a sudden, it\u2019s 2-2 in the eighth and we\u2019re facing high leverage guys.\u201d\nAbout that: Different ending, too. In the 10th, with Sam Haggerty on second and with Corey Seager issued an intentional walk, Marcus Semien drove a ball to deep enough center to advance the winning runner to third.\nMaybe the best way to measure guys ability to make adjustments from at-bat to at-bat is in on-base percentage. Getting on base moves the line and continues to build stress on the pitcher.\nThe Rangers OBP stays essentially flat innings 1-3 (.312) to innings 4-6 (.311), then drops precipitously in the late innings (.269). Among the biggest dropoffs from the first three to the middle three are Josh Smith (.402 to .308), Josh Jung (.360 to .224), Kyle Higashioka (.361 to .196) and Adolis Garc\u00eda (.301 to .264).\nBoth Smith and Jung, each in their first three seasons, acknowledged that pitchers are gaining an advantage on them.\n\u201cMaybe they are making a better adjustment off of me based on my first at-bat and I\u2019m not properly adjusting to them,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I change a lot from at-bat to at-bat. It could just be coincidence.\u201d\nIt could. It could also be yet another telling sign that this offense simply doesn\u2019t work as intended.\nEven manager Bruce Bochy, who does everything he can to find reasons to support his offense, had a hard time trying to dismiss it.\n\u201cWe talk about it, how important it is every inning,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cI wish I had a good answer for you. It shouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nYet it has. At least on Monday, the Rangers offered a different ending.\nFind more Rangers coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."
