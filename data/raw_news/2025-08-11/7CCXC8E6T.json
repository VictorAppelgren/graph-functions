  "content": "Oklo Inc OKLO reported second-quarter financial results after the market close on Monday. Here\u2019s a look at the key details from the report.\n\nWhat is OKLO\u2019s current stock price? Find out here.\n\nQ2 Earnings: Nuclear startup Oklo reported a second-quarter loss of 18 cents per share, missing estimates for a loss of 12 cents per share, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nOklo reported operating losses of $28 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by payroll, stock-based compensation and general business expenses. The company ended the quarter with $226.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $456.2 million of marketable securities.\n\nOklo said it\u2019s targeting submission of Phase 1 of its combined license application for its Aurora powerhouse early in the fourth quarter. Pre-construction activities are expected to begin in the third quarter. The company is targeting commercial operations for its first nuclear powerhouse in late 2027 or early 2028.\n\nOklo announced a strategic collaboration with Lightbridge Corp LTBR to explore a potential co-location of a Lightbridge fuel fabrication facility inside of Oklo\u2019s planned advanced fuel manufacturing infrastructure. The site would also serve as a joint research and development hub for advanced fuel development.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building the infrastructure to help fuel new nuclear development and deployment,\u201d said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo.\n\n\u201cThis collaboration supports our efforts to bolster near- and mid-term advanced reactor fuel supplies with legacy materials such as down-blended uranium and repurposed plutonium. It directly aligns with strong federal direction supporting domestic fuel independence.\u201d\n\nOklo\u2019s management team will further discuss the quarter on an earnings call with investors and analysts at 5 p.m. ET.\n\nOKLO Price Action: Oklo shares were down 0.097% in Monday's after-hours session at $71.79 at the time of publication, according to Benzinga Pro.",

      "text": "- NASA's moon reactor plan and Trump's nuclear push have sparked a rally in stocks like OKLO and BWXT, boosting nuclear-themed ETFs.\n- Strong earnings from BWX Technologies and upcoming results from OKLO are drawing investor interest to ETFs with nuclear exposure.\n- The next 100%+ earnings move could hit this month. See how to find it live on Wednesday \u2192\nThe Trump administration's directive to accelerate plans for a nuclear reactor on the moon has sparked renewed speculation and market interest in companies such as OKLO Inc. OKLO and BWX Technologies BWXT, highlighting the growing focus on a space-age energy race. Naturally, interest in nuclear-themed ETFs has taken the center stage.\n- Oklo is in focus after the Trump administration\u2019s directive to pursue a lunar nuclear reactor. Track its prices live.\nOKLO shares soared to an all-time high on Tuesday after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, acting NASA administrator, announced the beginning of a process to solicit commercial proposals for designing a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor for possible use on the moon. While no contractor has been selected, market speculation is focused on which companies could potentially benefit.\nBoth OKLO and NuScale Power Corp. SMR gained, buoyed by speculation that they could be contenders in the lunar energy program. BWX Technologies Inc BWXT, the primary U.S. Navy supplier of nuclear propulsion systems, experienced a rally that was not driven by moon dust alone.\nAfter the close on Monday, BWX Technologies announced second-quarter earnings that beat on both the top and bottom line. The company also raised its FY25 outlook.\nCEO Rex Geveden cited solid government performance and a faster-growing global demand for nuclear technology in the defense, clean energy, and medical spaces.\nBWX\u2019s earnings and guidance were actual fundamentals to support the thematic tailwinds, a rare coincidence in hype-driven trades.\nThose wanting to ride the nuclear energy hype, but not put all their bet in a single stock, are investing in ETFs offering diversified exposure to uranium, nuclear technology, and energy infrastructure.\nTop Nuclear-Themed ETFs\nGlobal X Uranium ETF URA:\n- Theme: Uranium miners and nuclear technology\n- Top Holdings: Cameco Corp CCJ, NexGen Energy Inc NEE\n- Relevance: Indirect exposure to the uranium supply chain that may fuel future moon or space reactors.\nVanEck Uranium And Nuclear Energy ETF NLR\n- Focus: Utilities and firms along the nuclear power value chain\n- Top Holdings: Constellation Energy Corp CEG, BWX Technologies\n- Relevance: Includes BWXT, providing direct exposure to defense and space-oriented nuclear contracts.\niShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF IFRA\n- Focus: Infrastructure projects supported by the federal government\n- Relevance: Not specifically nuclear, but it could gain from more generalized U.S. investment in space, energy, and defense infrastructure.\nNext Up: OKLO Earnings\nETF investors will be watching OKLO\u2019s Q2 earnings, due after market close on Aug. 11, to see if the lunar optimism is translating into real progress, contracts, or partnerships.\nThough its moon-related potential is conjectural, solid earnings or news-driven announcements may validate the excitement and trigger ETF flows.\nMacro Trend Meets Moon Mission\nThe Trump administration's endorsement of a lunar nuclear reactor marks a bold new chapter in the narrative of nuclear energy's potential as a space-faring strategic asset and national security tool.\nPaired with increasing global demand, favorable regulatory attitudes, and breakout profits from leaders, the industry is finally matching the hype.\nWhether or not this moonshot venture results in genuine commercial rewards or mere cosmic speculation, nuclear ETFs are on investors\u2019 radar screens again.\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
