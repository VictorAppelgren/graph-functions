This is also why the industry is plagued by many common wine myths. No, red wine isn't necessarily better aged, and you certainly can serve white wine with barbecue. Still, not everything is made up. Take, for instance, the rivalry between French and American oak. Matt Uva, wine industry professional and consultant at Ghosts in the Cellar explained to The Takeout that the difference between the two styles is significant. \"French oak from cooler climates like Allier, Nevers, and Tron\u00e7ais, grows slowly, producing a tighter grain. American oak is grown in regions warmer than those in France \u2014 Missouri, Minnesota \u2014 and grows faster, producing a looser grain.\" This creates a distinctive flavor for each method. \"With the tighter grain, there is a slower release of oak compounds into the wine. The looser grain will give a faster, more concentrated extraction. This leads to French oak feeling subtle and American oak feeling bold.\"\n\nUva elaborated on wine service, adding, \"If a sommelier raves about 'French oak' on a wine, we can expect finesse and nuance, a slight spice character, and seamless integration with the fruit.\" Conversely, American oak denotes a stronger flavor. \"American oak typically imparts vanilla, coconut, and toasted notes that are more immediately noticeable and can add a sweet or creamy impression to the wine,\" he said. \"When a sommelier mentions it, they're preparing you for a bolder, oak-forward style.\"\n\nRead more: Things You Should Never Say When Ordering A Drink At A Bar, According To Bartending Experts\n\nHow To Consider Oak Types When Ordering Wine\n\nAlthough some people have strong preferences between French and American oak, Matt Uva confirmed, \"One isn't better than the other; they're just different tools in a winemaker's kit.\" Similarly, drinkers can look for each style, depending on what they want in a given moment. \"French oak is finer grained and adds structure, texture, and spice notes to a wine,\" Uva explained. \"French oak tends to 'frame the fruit' rather than overpower it. The impact of French oak is a more polished and food-friendly wine.\" You can find this oak type in wines like high-end chardonnay, Burgundy, and Bordeaux, which are some of the best wines for pairing with steak and other smoky foods.\n\nMeanwhile, Uva noted, \"American oak has ... a higher concentration of aromatic compounds, giving it a more pronounced flavor imprint \u2014 most commonly adding sweet spice and vanilla notes ... [It] shows up frequently in fuller-bodied, fruit-forward wines like California cabernet sauvignon, zinfandel, Australian shiraz, and traditional Rioja. Its sweeter, more pronounced flavors marry well with ripe fruit and bolder styles.\"\n\nIf you're learning to determine which oak style has been used in a wine, Uva offered a handy shortcut. \"While this isn't true 100% of the time, I've found an easy marker for blind tasting to be, 'cocoa powder leans French; vanilla bean leans American'.\" Use this the next time you want to impress your friends while dining at a high-end restaurant.\n\nFor more food and drink goodness, join The Takeout's newsletter.

      "text": "The Truth Behind 3 Common Wine Myths\nAn expert explains why we age, chill, and pour wine the way we do.\nIf you're a wine novice like me, then you probably have some preconceived notions about the drink that may or may not be based in fact. I've picked up a lot of wine knowledge secondhand by observing other people enjoying it, without ever questioning certain truths or practices.\nWhy, for example, do people hold onto red wines for years in order to improve the taste? Why must I enjoy a red at room temperature while white wine must be chilled? And why is it such a faux pas to fill up my wine glass all the way? These are the questions I demand answers to.\nThankfully, Jim Bube, a master sommelier and the current National Wine Director for Hogsalt restaurant group, has lent me his expertise once again so we can all gain a better understanding of proper wine etiquette.\nShould you age red wine before drinking it?\nThere's actually no real need to age your red wine. Bube explains that most wines are released or sold ready to enjoy. So, if you purchased a bottle of wine and wanted to save it for a special occasion, you can\u2014but if you're simply unable to wait, there's no need to panic. Cracking that bad boy open ahead of schedule will not mean a less-than-optimal taste.\n\"It sort of depends on how ripe you like your banana,\" explains Bube. \"Most wine is released somewhat ripe and ready to go... the majority of wine that is sold in the United States is probably best enjoyed young, and this includes some of the more expensive wines that are out there.\"\nThis isn't to say that aging or waiting to enjoy a bottle won't have any effect on the experience. Aging a bottle of red will change the way it tastes. \"All of those fresh, fruity flavors sort of dry out and fall into the background, \u201d says Bube. \"Oftentimes the savory elements will increase while the fruity elements decrease.\" Bube also notes that the tannins (the molecules that give red wine its dry quality) will soften in an aged bottle, and generally the wine becomes a bit less astringent.\nHowever, overall, the decision to age a red wine (or even a white) comes down to personal preference, as the process isn't always reliable.\nWhy chill white wine, but never red?\nMy mom always tells me to put white wine in the refrigerator but never the red, and I've always accepted this as the proper way to serve each type of wine. It turns out that Bube has proven my mom wrong. The serving temperature of a wine is, like the aging process, more determined by personal preference than anything else.\n\"I think nine times out of 10, white wine is served too cold at restaurants, and red wine is served too warm,\" says Bube, who actually prefers both whites and reds to be slightly chilled. He believes lowering the serving temperature of either wine improves their drinkability by giving them a more refreshing element while maintaining their overall character and integrity.\nI wholeheartedly agree with Bube on this one, and I'm glad to know that I can throw my bottles of red wine into the refrigerator for a little while without any concern that I might be hindering my drinking experience. As for white wine, if you need to chill a bottle quickly, Bube says you can wrap it in a wet towel (or wet paper towels) and pop it in the freezer for several minutes.\nWhy don\u2019t we fill wine glasses to the top?\nPouring wine so that the glass is only about 30% full is another practice I've observed and been told (by my mother) is absolutely necessary. Well, Mom, you were right about this one.\nThe reason for this, explains Bube, is that you want to be able to smell the wine as much as possible. \"What helps you do this is a little bit more space for that wine to stretch out aromatically,\" he says. \"Think about the design and shape of a wine glass: generally it's going to be a little wider to the middle, which is where it's designed to be filled to.\" This means if you fill the glass to the top, there will be less surface area for you to smell and take in the qualities of the wine.\n(Fun tip: To truly put this practice to the test, Bube suggests tasting the same wine in different sizes and shapes of glasses and at different pour levels.)\nSimilarly, there's a reason people swirl their wine around inside the glass, and it's not just to look fancy. Doing so creates more areas where the wine is clinging to the sides of the glass, bringing those aromatics closer to your nose for smelling.\nYet again, Bube has changed what I thought I knew about wine and helped to quench my recurring thirst for wine knowledge. Until our next lesson, I hope you enjoy your freshly purchased, lightly chilled wine in a glass designed for optimal sniffing."

  "argos_summary": "The article explains that French oak, grown in cooler climates, has a tighter grain that releases compounds slowly, imparting subtle, spicy notes, while American oak, from warmer regions, has a looser grain that extracts more quickly, producing bold vanilla and coconut flavors. Sommeliers use these distinctions to describe wine styles, with French oak favoring finesse and food\u2011friendly structure, and American oak favoring bold, fruit\u2011forward profiles. The piece also debunks common wine myths, noting that most wines are ready to drink upon release, that serving temperatures are largely a matter of preference, and that glasses should be filled to about 30% to maximize aroma.",
