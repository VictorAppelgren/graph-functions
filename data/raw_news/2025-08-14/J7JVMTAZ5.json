      "text": "Broward County State Attorney's Office declines to charge Browns rookie Quinshon Judkins\nThis story has been updated with new information.\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 The Broward County State Attorney's Office will not be filing formal charges against Cleveland Browns running back Quinshon Judkins.\nBarbara M. Driscoll, Assistant State Attorney Domestic Violence Unit, submitted a Decline Memorandum into Judkins' file with the Broward County State Attorney's Office on Aug. 14. In the memorandum, she stated multiple reasons for coming to the ultimate conclusion that \"this is no reasonable likelihood of conviction\" and that \"this case is being declined.\"\nThe report stated the following reasons for the decision:\n- \"This incident was not captured on any video surveillance.\"\n- \"There are no independent witnesses to the incident.\"\n- \"Although the victim had photos showing injuries sustained, there were also videos in that same time frame where no injuries were observed to the victim.\"\n- \"Additionally, the victim's injuries depicted in the photos could be explained by either account of the incident.\"\n- \"Finally, there was a delayed report of the incident. The delay is problematic as the victim was alone on numerous occasions without the Defendant, had the ability and resources to make the report without his knowledge, but chose not to do so.\"\nThe memorandum that the Assistant State Attorney received \"police reports, bodyworn camera videos, video surveillance from numerous places the couple has been, photos, phone records, and the victim's sworn statement.\" The memo said \"the following evidence in the case was reviewed: body worn camera videos, surveillance videos from the airport, hotels, restaurants, clubs, and valet, photos showing bruising and marks on the victim, cell phone text messages and calls.\"\nThe memorandum stated the ASA was in contact with Judkins' attorney, who submitted a proffer of Judkins' version of the events. The ASA and the State Attorney's Office's Victim Advocate were also in frequent contact with the victim, who had retained her own attorney.\nThe Browns did not have a comment. The NFL issued a statement to the Beacon Journal saying, \"We have been following developments in the matter which remains under review.\u201d\nJudkins' original arrest by Fort Lauderdale police brought with it a charge of \"touch or strike/battery/domestic violence,\" which is a first-degree misdemeanor in Florida. However, the 175-day waiver in the filing would cover a felony charge, while a misdemeanor would only be a 60-day window.\nThe filing is the first of any kind in Judkins' case since he was released on a $2,500 bond on July 13, a day after his arrest. There had been no hearings of any kind set by the court system since then.\nJudkins' arrest stemmed from an incident on July 7 when the woman with whom he was traveling told police he \"punched her in the mouth/chin area with a closed fist.\" He later allegedly punched her on her left arm and leg while in their rental car.\nJudkins, taking No. 36 overall, is the only pick from the 2025 NFL Draft who remains unsigned. The Browns tabled their contract negotiations with the former Ohio State and Ole Miss running back while the legal process played out.\nUnsigned draft picks can not participate in training camp. They are not subjected to fines for missed time.\nChris Easterling can be reached at ceasterling@thebeaconjournal.com. Read more about the Browns at www.beaconjournal.com/sports/browns.
