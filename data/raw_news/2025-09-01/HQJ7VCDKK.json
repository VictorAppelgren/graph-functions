  "title": "Bank of China Stock Jumps Amid Rumours of Stablecoin Licensing Plans",
  "description": "Reports that Bank of China Hong Kong plans to apply for a local stablecoin license have fueled speculation and a surge in share prices.",
  "content": "The Bank of China\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares rose by 6.7% on Monday, trading at HKD$37.58, after local media reports suggested that the bank\u2019s Hong Kong unit is preparing to apply for a stablecoin issuer license.\n\nThe Hong Kong Economic Journal reported that the Chinese state bank\u2019s branch had formed a dedicated task force to explore stablecoin issuance.\n\nThe Bank of China did not respond to a request for comment, but in last week\u2019s results call it told investors it was researching digital asset applications and their risk management.\n\nHong Kong introduced its stablecoin licensing regime on August 1, requiring issuers to secure approval from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The framework imposes strict requirements on reserve management, redemption guarantees, client fund segregation, anti-money laundering, disclosure and operator vetting. The rules came shortly after the U.S. passed its first federal stablecoin law, the GENIUS Act.\n\nHong Kong Kicks Off Stablecoin Licensing Regime With Eye on Global Hub\n\nThe city\u2019s regime has already attracted interest from major financial institutions, including Standard Chartered.\n\nChinese tech giants JD.com and Ant Financial have also announced plans to seek licenses abroad for services targeting their international businesses, which could include applying in Hong Kong. JD founder Richard Liu said in June the company aims to use stablecoins to reduce cross-border payment costs, first for business-to-business transfers before expanding to consumers.\n\nVincent Chok, CEO of Hong Kong-based First Digital, told Decrypt the appeal of stablecoins lies in efficiency. \"Blockchain technology reduces settlement times and bypasses the traditional intermediary fees of banks,\" he said, adding that the opportunity is \"especially pronounced in emerging markets, where growing stablecoin adoption provides users a hedge against currency volatility.\"\n\nWhile the cost advantage varies by corridor and transaction type, Chok noted that adoption is accelerating as regulation provides clarity. \u201cThe current trajectory suggests exponential growth in the next 2-5 years,\u201d he added.\n\nStill, Hong Kong regulators have urged restraint. In mid-August, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the HKMA jointly warned investors that market swings tied to licensing rumours may be misleading.\n\n\u201cThese movements appear to follow corporate announcements, news reports, social media posts or speculations regarding plans to apply,\u201d they said. \u201cGiven the significant uncertainties surrounding the outcomes of these preliminary plans or applications, the abrupt market movements... highlight the need to stay vigilant in these frenetic situations.\u201d",

      "text": "Hong Kong officially introduced its long-awaited licensing regime for fiat-referenced stablecoins Thursday, tightening oversight of digital assets as the city pursues its ambition to become a global crypto hub.\nUnder the new law, which took effect on August 1, any company wishing to issue or market stablecoins to retail investors must first obtain a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\nThe licensing requirements span a host of compliance areas, including reserve asset management, redemption at par value, segregation of client funds, anti-money laundering protocols, disclosures, and fit-and-proper tests for operators.\nThe launch of the stablecoin regime marks the latest chapter in Hong Kong\u2019s wider crypto policy overhaul. Over the past few years, the city has implemented a licensing framework for exchanges and introduced new rules on virtual assets as it seeks to rebuild its status as a financial gateway between China and the world.\nIt also comes after the U.S. passed the GENIUS Act, its first piece of federal stablecoin legislation.\nThe contrast between the two regimes is notable. \"The key difference is in how the overseeing governments are structured,\" Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, told Decrypt. \"In Hong Kong, the HKMA acts as the sole regulator, which simplifies things quite a bit, whereas in the U.S., regulation is layered due to the federal and state systems.\"\nWhile both frameworks require 100% reserve backing to ensure redemption stability, Hong Kong's rules are already in force and offer a multi-currency scope, potentially positioning the city as a more flexible destination for stablecoin projects with global aspirations.\nDespite a relatively small domestic market, interest in stablecoins in Hong Kong is rising.\nAndy K.T. Lau, a partner at David Cameron Law Office, said clients are increasingly looking at stablecoins not just as speculative instruments, but as potential payment rails.\n\"Clients are interested in exploring how stablecoins can facilitate both online and offline transactions, moving beyond mere trading purposes,\" he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve observed an increasing interest from clients in forming partnerships with stablecoin issuers and payment platforms. I anticipate new applications across various sectors such as finance, retail, and local businesses,\" he added.\n\"Many of my clients are eager to seize these opportunities, and I believe that collaboration between traditional financial institutions and digital asset platforms will be crucial for driving stablecoin adoption.\u201d\nThat said, Hong Kong\u2019s consumer payment landscape is already saturated. Walk into any shop and you\u2019ll see terminals for cards like Visa and Mastercard, QR-based systems like AliPay and WeChat Pay, machines that tap Octopus Cards, and cash. Given that crowd, stablecoins aren\u2019t expected to become the go-to payment system \u2014 at least as a standalone product that isn't integrated into existing systems \u2014 anytime soon.\nInstead, local businesses say the real opportunity may lie in international applications. Hong Kong\u2019s global trading role gives it an edge for cross-border remittances and business payments, especially for firms that struggle with slow banking rails.\nAmong them, Edwin Cheung, CEO of Gate Dubai and a former head of business development at Gate HK, told Decrypt that firms in mainland China were \u201cenergetic\u201d about the Hong Kong regime.\n\u201cThey want to leverage this stablecoin regime either through their own stablecoin or they can use this stablecoin technology or blockchain technology to utilize their own payment network within their business.\u201d\nThough stablecoins aren\u2019t permitted to be used under China\u2019s strict cryptocurrency regulations, major e-commerce firms like JD.com and AliPay have confirmed they are exploring stablecoin use for their international businesses.\nBroader use cases\nCheung said he had spoken to one travel firm that was interested in using stablecoins to make collecting payments from the different countries they work in easier. He said in some cases, it was taking up to thirty days to collect fees from various hotels and firms around the world.\n\u201cThe timing is one [use]. The other part is they don\u2019t have a local bank account or banking railways to collect from [for example] Argentinian or Brazilian hotels,\u201d he said.\nHe added that adoption by large firms could drive greater interest on the retail level, comparing it to AliPay\u2019s move into Hong Kong several years ago.\n\u201cMass adoption has to come from a big company that has already got the ecosystem and that has inbuilt the stablecoin into it, and encourages the users to start using it\u2014it will drive the growth,\u201d he added.\nDespite the momentum, concerns remain around cost and accessibility. Some firms, such as payment company Airwallex, have disavowed stablecoins completely, saying they don't see how the technology solves pain points in international transfers.\nHong Kong's rules also favor big players. Under current rules, stablecoin issuers must have at least HK$25 million in paid-up share capital, a bar that could deter smaller innovators.\n\"To encourage innovation, we should have tiered capital requirements,\" Tiena Sekharan, Head of Strategic Reserve Solutions at Chavanette Advisors, told Decrypt. \"Lower issuance should be possible with lower capital than the current requirement.\"\nShe also called for a passporting mechanism that would let firms licensed in compliant jurisdictions like the U.S., Singapore, or the EU operate in Hong Kong with minimal red tape. \"This would reduce licensing costs for compliant issuers,\" she added."

      "text": "In brief\n- JD.com is planning to apply for stablecoin licenses in major economies.\n- It will initially focus on using them for B2B payments before expanding to consumers.\n- It is part of a broader push by the company to recover from \"five lost years\" lacking in growth and innovation.\nJD.com plans to apply for stablecoin licenses in multiple countries as part of a comprehensive effort to reduce the cost and time of cross-border payments, Richard Liu, founder and chairman, announced on Tuesday.\nSpeaking at a press conference in Beijing, Liu said the Chinese e-commerce giant aims to launch stablecoin services globally, starting with business-to-business payments and eventually expanding to consumer use.\n\"We aim to apply for our stablecoin license in all major sovereign currency countries in the world,\" Liu said. \"Our vision is that one day, people around the world will be able to use JD\u2019s local coins for global payments.\"\nLiu said the company believes stablecoins could reduce settlement times to under 10 seconds and cut payment costs by up to 90%.\nThe initiative is part of JD.com's effort to reverse years of stagnation. Once a dominant force in Chinese e-commerce, JD has struggled with what Liu called \"five lost years,\" characterized by a lack of innovation and sluggish growth. The stablecoin project joins a broader slate of new ventures, including moves into food delivery and tourism.\n\"JD.com\u2019s stablecoin push signals that stablecoins have moved beyond the pilot phase in Asia,\" Amy Zhang, head of APAC at digital asset infrastructure provider Fireblocks, told Decrypt. \"By issuing its own stablecoin instead of relying on a known stablecoin or Payment Service Provider, JD.com is positioning to eliminate 2-3% interchange fees, reduce clearing times from days to seconds, and capture treasury yields from stablecoin holdings.\"\nThe company\u2019s stablecoin push also comes as global momentum behind the technology continues to grow.\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill establishing a regulatory framework for issuing and trading stablecoins. The bill passed 68-30 and has drawn interest from major banks, retailers, and tech firms. Companies including Amazon, Walmart, and Citigroup are already exploring stablecoin applications.\nStill, critics warn that the technology could empower large corporations to issue private currencies and track consumer data. Senator Elizabeth Warren has criticized the GENIUS Act as a backdoor for tech giants to launch surveillance-based financial products.\n\"If Congress doesn\u2019t fix it, billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg could launch stablecoins that track your purchases, exploit your data, and squeeze out competitors,\" Warren previously told Decrypt.\n\u201cThen they\u2019ll come begging for a bailout when it inevitably blows up,\u201d she added.\nOthers argue that stablecoins offer poor value to consumers since they typically don\u2019t yield interest, even though companies themselves can potentially earn it on customer deposits.\nCoatue Management founder Philippe Laffont has called for basic contracts that would pass on spot interest rates to stablecoin holders.\nJD did not specify a launch timeline or which jurisdictions it would prioritize for licensing. It described the initiative as an \"overseas project,\" suggesting it would not be rolled out in China itself.\nThe company did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment on that point.\nEdited by Sebastian Sinclair\nEditor's note: Adds additional comment from Fireblocks"

He also restated his pledge to ensure the U.S. will not have a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, which he signed an executive order in January to ban.\nThe event was attended by numerous crypto industry heavyweights, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, Kraken Co-CEO Dave Ripley, and Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.\nVice President JD Vance was also present for the signing, along with new SEC Chair Paul Atkins and SEC Commissioners Mark Uyeda and Hester Peirce.\nTrump also called out the presence of Bo Hines, the executive director of the President's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, as well as David Sacks, the chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Sacks spoke to the crowd following President Trump's initial comments.\n\"The first six months of this administration have been more successful than any administration in history, in terms of what's been done,\" said Sacks. \"It's just been incredible. President Trump has worked at 'tech speed.' We're used to working fast in Silicon Valley, but even this is fast for us in Silicon Valley.\"\nStablecoins are digital assets, typically pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar, that are designed to remain steady in price and allow crypto traders to easily enter and exit positions without accessing dollars directly. They are thus considered a key ramp between crypto markets and traditional finance.\nNow signed into law, the GENIUS Act\u2014which establishes a framework for issuing and trading stablecoins\u2014is poised to unlock tremendous interest in crypto from banks, traditional finance players, and major retailers, which have all in recent months expressed great interest in adopting and issuing stablecoins.\nThese companies, however, have generally wanted to wait to move forward with stablecoin-related projects until the sector received the blessing of the federal government. Now it has.\n\u201cStablecoins are at a turning point,\u201d Jesse McWaters, Mastercard\u2019s head of global policy, said in a statement shared with Decrypt. \u201cThe passage of the GENIUS Act by the U.S. Congress signals a new era of regulatory clarity and confidence in digital assets.\u201d\nThe Trump administration, congressional Republicans, and crypto industry leaders have all taken victory laps in the hours since the GENIUS Act passed the House yesterday.\nWhile the bill was widely expected to pass with bipartisan support\u2014and ultimately did\u2014a themed \u201cCrypto Week\u201d on Capitol Hill was nearly derailed days ago when a faction of right-wing Republicans tanked procedural votes on multiple digital asset-focused bills, pro-crypto Democrats pilloried the legislation from the left, and some crypto advocates attacked the bills as not favorable enough to their industry.\nClear rules for stablecoins and the road ahead\nAt the White House today, the first piece of U.S. crypto legislation will be signed into law: the GENIUS Act. It provides clear rules for stablecoins.\nThis is a historic moment \u2014 not just for crypto, but for the world at large.\u2026\n\u2014 Chris Dixon (@cdixon) July 18, 2025\nWhile the GENIUS Act firmly legalizes the stablecoin sector, much of the crypto industry still remains in relative legal limbo, despite decisively favorable actions recently taken by regulators including the SEC.\nA separate crypto market structure bill, considered the top prize of crypto\u2019s most powerful companies, would firmly legalize most crypto activity, and is currently making its way through Congress\u2014though its odds of passage have long been considered more daunting than the less expansive stablecoin bill today.\nOn Thursday, however, a market structure bill handily passed a vote in the House, garnering the support of nearly all Republicans and 78 Democrats.\nAlongside excitement over the signing of the GENIUS Act, industry proponents remained focused on the next challenge, one many consider to be more important to their business interests: passing sweeping market structure legislation.\n\u201cWe should celebrate a little bit, but we also don\u2019t think that anyone\u2019s being complacent,\" Robinhood CEO Tenev told Decrypt on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s a big step, but of course, it\u2019s not the end of it. We want to have clarity around tokenizing securities. And private equity is something we care about quite a bit.\u201d"
