  "content": "MELBOURNE, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Peabody Energy (BTU.N) is set to reveal on August 19 whether it will continue with its $3.78 billion bid for Anglo American's (AAL.L) Australian coking coal mines, as time ticks down for it to renegotiate a lower price for the deal.\n\nThe U.S. miner last year agreed to buy the mines in Queensland's Bowen Basin, the world's top coking coal region, as part of its move into becoming a coking coal producer.\n\nBut in March, the Moranbah North mine was closed due to high gas levels, leading Peabody to trigger a clause that allows a party to break or renegotiate a deal if a significant negative event occurs between signing and completion. In this case, it gave a 90 day consultation process which expired on August 3.\n\nSince it has not reached a revised agreement with the seller, Peabody intends to provide an update on August 19, it said at its results.\n\n\"We believe a last minute deal has become less likely, and our base case now is that this goes to arbitration,\" Jefferies said in a note on Monday. The broker estimates a $316 million value hit if the Moranbah North mine is able to be ramped back to full capacity within three months from Sept 1.\n\nAnglo says the event does not qualify as significant since damages and downtime are likely to be limited and CEO Duncan Wanblad has said next steps were up to Peabody .\n\nPart of the standoff is because it is unclear when the mine will be able to restart while the state regulator assesses its safety. The regulator did not provide a timeline when contacted by Reuters but said the mine was undergoing a \"staged approach\" to reentry as it prioritised worker safety.\n\nFor Anglo, any arbitration would push back its restructure, and may raise concerns around mine management and choice of buyer.\n\nStrong interest from previous bidders is expected and Anglo is prepared to rerun the process, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Anglo did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nFor Peabody, ending the deal would ease the pressure of looming repayments to a $2 billion dollar bridge loan due from late November. Peabody posted a second quarter loss as coal prices fell by a third from a year earlier. Peabody and Anglo did not immediately comment outside office hours.",

The Trust Principles imposed obligations on Reuters and its employees to act at all times with integrity, independence, and freedom from bias.\nReuters Directors and shareholders were determined to protect and preserve the Trust Principles when Reuters became a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. A unique structure was put in place to achieve this. A new company was formed and given the name 'Reuters Founders Share Company Limited', its purpose being to hold a 'Founders Share' in Reuters.\nThe legal structure has evolved over time and the Founders Share and other contractual arrangements now confer a number of special rights upon the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company. For example, (i) the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company has enhanced voting rights in circumstances where someone is seeking to obtain a significant shareholding in, or acquire control of, Thomson Reuters and (ii) the prior consent of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company must be sought prior to undertaking any sale of, or other material transaction involving, the Reuters news business unit.\nThomson Reuters itself is obliged and committed to apply the Trust Principles to its operations. The charter documents of Thomson Reuters Corporation include provisions to safeguard the Trust Principles as they apply to the Thomson Reuters business and require Thomson Reuters Directors, in the performance of their duties, to have due regard to the Trust Principles, by the proper exercise of their powers and in accordance with their other duties as Directors.\nThe Trust Principles are:\n- That Reuters shall at no time pass into the hands of any one interest, group, or faction;\n- That the integrity, independence, and freedom from bias of Thomson Reuters shall at all times be fully preserved;\n- That Reuters shall supply unbiased and reliable news services to newspapers, news agencies, broadcasters, and other media subscribers and to businesses, governments, institutions, individuals, and others with whom Reuters has or may have contracts;\n- That Thomson Reuters shall pay due regard to the many interests which it serves in addition to those of the media; and\n- That no effort shall be spared to expand, develop, and adapt the news and other services and products of Thomson Reuters so as to maintain its leading position in the international news and information business\nThomson Reuters Founders Share Company was established in 1984 when Reuters became a public company. The directors of Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company (known as \u2018Trustees\u2019) have a duty to ensure, to the extent possible, that the Trust Principles are complied with.\nThe Trustees are experienced and eminent people from diverse arenas in politics, diplomacy, media, public service and business. The Trustees are selected by a nomination committee and proposed to the board of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company for appointment. The nomination committee assists in scrutinizing candidates\u2019 suitability and its members include two persons appointed by the chairman after consultation with the European Court of Human Rights and representatives of certain press associations. The Thomson Reuters Corporation board has two representatives on the nomination committee. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company Board are members of the nomination committee, and the Chairman appoints three other directors of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company as members of the nomination committee. The Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company acts as chairman of the nomination committee.\nThe number of Trustees has to be at least 14 and not more than 18. Trustees have a minimum of two meetings per year, and receive reports on our activities in the different fields in which we operate (including Reuters news). The Trustees meet with both the Thomson Reuters Board and representatives of senior management. Through Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company's Chairman, regular contact is maintained with our company.
