  "content": "An explosion at a U.S. Steel plant south of Pittsburgh killed two people and injured 10 others. The CEO has vowed to find out what caused Monday\u2019s blast while union officials say representatives will work to ensure a thorough investigation.\n\nThe plant, Clairton Coke Works, is one of four major plants in Pennsylvania owned by U.S. Steel, an icon of the domestic steel industry and American industrialization for over a century. The plant is in the Mon Valley, a region of the state synonymous with steel.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said it was treating three patients at UPMC Mercy, the region\u2019s only level one trauma and burn center.\n\nCoke is made by baking coal in special ovens for hours at high temperatures, which removes impurities that could otherwise weaken steel. The process creates what\u2019s known as coke gas \u2014 made up of a lethal mix of methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.\n\n2. In July 2010, an explosion injured 14 employees and six contractors. Afterward, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined U.S. Steel and a subcontractor $175,000 for safety violations. U.S. Steel appealed its citations and $143,500 in fines, which were later reduced under a settlement agreement.\n\n4. In February, a problem with a battery at the plant led to a \u201cbuildup of combustible material\u201d that ignited, causing an audible \u201cboom,\u201d officials said. Two workers received first aid treatment but were not seriously injured.\n\nAfter Monday\u2019s blast, the county health department initially told residents within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the plant to remain indoors and close all windows and doors. The department lifted the advisory after its monitors didn\u2019t detect levels of soot or sulfur dioxide above federal standards.",
