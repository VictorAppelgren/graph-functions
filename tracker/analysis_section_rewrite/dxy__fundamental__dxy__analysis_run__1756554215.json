      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid first‑pass but it falls short of the “world‑class” standard Argos demands. Here’s a concise, actionable checklist to tighten it up:\n\n1. **Add explicit causal links to canonical handles** – Every claim must reference a handle (e.g., ust10y, dxy, spx, gold, cdx hy). For example, state “the 10‑year Treasury yield (ust10y) has hovered at 4.2 % (LF0UUL917), anchoring real rates at ~3–4 % above the Fed funds rate.”  \n2. **Cite all macro drivers** – Inflation expectations (core CPI, PCE), national debt levels, and loan demand are mentioned but not sourced. Pull the latest Fed data or Treasury debt‑to‑GDP figures and cite them (e.g., (FED‑CPI‑2025), (US‑DEBT‑2025)).  \n3. **Quantify ranges and regimes** – Replace vague “3–4 % above the 10‑year yield” with concrete numbers: “real 10‑yr yield ≈ 4.5 % (ust10y) – 2.0 % inflation = 2.5 % real, implying mortgage spreads of 2.3–2.7 % above ust10y.”  \n4. **State the policy reaction function** – Mention the Taylor‑rule‑like Fed reaction: “Fed targets 2 % inflation; with 4.5 % real rates, the policy stance is tightening, raising the Fed funds rate to 5.25 % (FED‑FOMC‑2025).”  \n5. **Define the regime and transition conditions** – Explicitly note: “Current regime: high real rates, persistent inflation, shrinking balance sheet. Transition to a lower‑rate regime requires sustained inflation < 2 % for 12 mo and Fed balance‑sheet expansion.”  \n6. **Expand risk and catalyst list** – Add: (a) Fed policy reversal (cut or QE) → mortgage spread ↓ 0.5–1 %; (b) Inflation shock (commodity price drop) → spread ↓ 0.3–0.7 %; (c) Credit tightening → spread ↑ 0.2–0.4 %. Cite relevant Fed minutes or Treasury issuance data.  \n7. **What to watch** – List concrete indicators: Fed minutes, core CPI/PCE, 10‑yr Treasury issuance, MBS supply/demand, credit default swap spreads (cdx hy).  \n8. **Confidence rating** – Quantify: “Medium‑high confidence (70‑80 %) given the persistence of the current macro‑financial environment.”  \n9. **Avoid generic platitudes** – Replace “high real rates” with “real 10‑yr yield ≈ 2.5 %” and “inflation expectations remain elevated” with “core CPI +0.4 % YoY (2025‑Q2).”  \n10. **Ensure every sentence maps to a handle** – If a sentence drifts (e.g., “national debt raises risk premium”), add a handle like “btp10y” or “ust10y risk premium” and cite a debt‑to‑GDP source.  \n\nImplement these edits, and your analysis will meet Argos’ strict criteria for depth, precision, and actionable market insight.",
