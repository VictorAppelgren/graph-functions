Though the data showed inflation had ticked up, it increased by less than expected. The results boosted bets the Fed would cut interest rates at its September policy meeting, especially in light of recent warnings signs the labor market is weakening.\n\nIn after-hours trading, Circle (CRCL) sank after the company announced it would sell 10 million shares on the heels of its first earnings report since its explosive public debut. Cava (CAVA) shares also dove after the company issued its first annual sales growth target cut. CoreWeave (CRWV) saw losses too despite beating revenue estimates on strong demand for AI.\n\nLater this week, investors will get two more snapshots on the state of the economy with the release of the Producer Price Index on Thursday and retail sales data on Friday.",

The monthly drop was driven by lower gasoline prices and moderately softer food inflation.\n\"Although core annual inflation is back to its highest level since February, today\u2019s CPI print is not hot enough to derail the Fed from cutting rates in September,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, wrote in reaction to the report.\nShah noted some evidence of tariff-related pass-through to consumers, though not yet at a level that \"rings alarm bells.\" One example: Footwear prices jumped 1.4% in July from the prior month \u2014 the largest monthly increase since April 2021.\nOther categories seeing increases included furniture and bedding, recreation, household furnishings and operations, and used cars and trucks. Airline fares jumped 4% after a 0.1% decline in June, while lodging away from home and communication were among the few major indexes to fall last month, according to the BLS.\nTuesday's report arrives amid ongoing trade developments that could further alter the US effective tariff rate, now hovering near 18.6% \u2014 the highest since 1933, according to the latest Yale Budget Lab estimate.\nRead more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\nThe back-and-forth raises fresh questions about the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting path."

The announcement came on the heels of the company's first-ever earnings report since its blockbuster public debut, which showed better-than-expected revenue during the quarter.\nIn an SEC filing, the stable-coin issuer said it is offering 2 million shares of Class A common stock and 8 million shares by existing stockholders.\nIn day trading, Circle shares closed north of $163 per share, or more than 1% higher, after the company's second quarter total revenue came in at $658 million, versus the $647 million analysts expected.\nCEO Jeremy Allaire said the company's stablecoin, USDC (USDC-USD), was the \"fastest-growing major stablecoin over the past year.\"\nUSDC in circulation grew 90% year over year to $61.3 billion at quarter end and has grown an additional 6.4% to $65.2 billion as of Aug. 10.\n\"Overall activity globally in the digital asset economy has been growing,\" Allaire told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday morning.\n\"We're continuing to see growth in the use of dollar digital currencies like USDC as a store of value around the world in cross-border settlements,\" he added. \"Use cases continue to expand, and I think people are finding that this is an incredibly high utility, new form of money.\"\nThe company also announced ARC, a new blockchain network for stablecoin finance that will launch in the second half of the year.\n\"We wanted to create a way for institutions to pay fees on blockchains in a fast, predictable manner that would be simple from an accounting perspective and could deliver very low-cost and stable fees,\" Allaire said during the company's earnings call on Tuesday morning.\nCircle, which went public on June 5, has been at the center of optimism over the stablecoin market following the passage of the GENIUS Act, legislation that creates guardrails and a framework for digital tokens backed by assets such as the US dollar.\nRead more: Can you buy crypto with a credit card? See the pros and cons.\nCircle makes much of its money from interest income, specifically from short-term Treasury bills backing its stablecoin, USDC.\nThe company's reserve income increased 50% year over year to $634 million, primarily from an 86% growth in USDC stablecoin circulation.\nAllaire indicated that if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates and yields on short-term Treasurys decline, the growth of stablecoins will offset the decline in rates."

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped nearly 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) also added around 1.4%.

Around 94% of traders expect that outcome, according to the CME Group.\nThe report was the first major piece of economic data to be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics after Trump fired Erika McEntarfer as commissioner earlier this month, following the release of the July jobs report.

It also reported a revenue backlog of $30.1 billion as of the end of June, compared with $25.9 billion on March 31.\n\"Demand is humming, but it is the cost of growth that tempered the stock down in aftermarket trading,\" said Michael Ashley Schulman of Running Point Capital Advisors.\nOperating expenses jumped to $1.19 billion in the second quarter, from $317.7 million a year earlier.\nThe company posted a net loss of $290.5 million, compared with analysts' average estimate of $190.6 million, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\"We are scaling rapidly as we look to meet the unprecedented demand for AI,\" CEO Michael Intrator said. \"There's a lot of different pieces that are constrained, but ultimately the piece that is the most significant challenge right now is accessing power shells that are capable of delivering the scale of infrastructure that our clients are requiring.\"\nThe company reiterated the benefits of its $9 billion all-stock deal for crypto miner Core Scientific, which will help it secure the firm's entire 1.3 GW power under contract and future pipeline. The comment comes as Two Seas Capital, the largest shareholder of Core Scientific, said last week it would vote against the sale.\nInvestors have also focused on the company's reliance on a few big customers. CoreWeave said it has also expanded contracts with hyperscalers in the past few weeks to meet their growing internal and external demand.\n\"The backlog surge to $30B+ suggests demand visibility well beyond 2025, but the concentration in mega-customers like OpenAI means those relationships remain both the crown jewel and the single point of failure,\" said eMarketer analyst Jeremy Goldman.\nCoreWeave has seen rising demand for AI inference, especially when models use chain-of-thought reasoning to go through a problem in a logical sequence \u2014 a technique doubled down on by frontier labs such as OpenAI.\n\"The actual quality of the intelligence was improved so much by the chain-of-reasoning models, but it also requires an incredible increase in the amount of computing to be able to drive that level of accuracy,\" Intrator said in an interview."

However, customer traffic remained almost flat in the second quarter, with its same-store sales rising 2.1%, below estimates of 6.47%, according to data compiled by LSEG.\nCava now expects full-year same-restaurant sales growth between 4% and 6%, compared with its prior target of 6% to 8%.\nConsumers were less confident than they were a year ago as economic uncertainties weighed, which led to weaker traffic in June and early July, but visits have improved since, said Brett Schulman, Cava's co-founder and CEO.\nCava is opening more stores to capitalize on the resilient demand for its menu items and has raised its target for annual new restaurant openings to a range of 68 to 70, from 64 to 68 expected earlier.\nIt also maintained targets for annual profit margin and core profit.\nThe company does not plan to increase prices and would try to absorb any inflationary costs from tariffs, Schulman added.\n\"As we've seen the last few weeks, I don't know that these recent announcements (on tariffs) will be the same announcements in a couple of weeks.

      "text": "Wall Street strategists are sharply recalibrating their economic outlooks after Friday's July jobs report showed weaker-than-expected hiring and staggering downward revisions to prior months' data, suggesting the labor market may be losing steam at a quicker pace than previously thought.\nThe US economy added just 73,000 jobs in July, far below the 104,000 expected by economists. But the bigger surprise came from revisions to the May and June figures, which collectively erased 258,000 jobs. This marked the largest two-month downward revision since May 2020.\nSarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, called the July jobs report \"a dud\" in a client note titled \"July and the No Good, Very Bad Jobs Report.\"\n\"The 'solid' state of the labor market described by the FOMC earlier this week looks more questionable after the July employment report,\" she said, citing broad-based hiring weakness in cyclically sensitive sectors like manufacturing, retail, and professional services.\nDespite persistent strength in healthcare hiring, she added, \"the pace [of job growth] has lurched lower to just 35K\" over the past three months when factoring in revisions.\nSteve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, bluntly told Yahoo Finance that the July numbers were simply \"not good. There's no way to sugarcoat that. The two-month revision is just staggering. It basically wipes out two months of what we thought were healthy job gains.\"\nCiti economist Veronica Clark agreed, telling Yahoo Finance, \"It's not so much this July number, but the massive downward revisions to the June number that we had last month. ... This definitely does look like a labor market that is weakening.\"\nMeanwhile, Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, called the report a \"gamechanger\" in a post on X, echoing others in saying \"the labor market now looks a lot weaker than expected.\"\nThe unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% in July, in line with expectations and still near historic lows. But as Clark pointed out, \"that happened despite the labor force participation rate falling more,\" a shift some economists have linked to President Trump's immigration crackdown.\nAhead of the report, there were growing concerns that increased deportations were reducing labor supply and keeping the jobless rate artificially low.\nSeptember rate cut odds surge\nThe revised data has added urgency to calls for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, with market pricing shifting notably in the aftermath.\n\"We still anticipate that the Fed starts to cut in September with consecutive cuts thereafter leading to about 100 basis points of cuts in total,\" said Leslie Falcone, head of taxable fixed income strategy at UBS Global Wealth Management.\nFalcone noted that while the Fed had already turned more cautious, the scale of the revisions surprised even the most dovish forecasters. \"Some of these revisions are much more than what people expected. ... I do think that this is a bit on the weaker side. And it does put cuts back on the table.\"\nTraders seem to agree. Following the report, the probability of a September rate cut surged to about 80%, up from just 38% the day prior, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\nEarlier this week, Fed governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller broke from the majority of FOMC officials, dissenting against the decision to hold interest rates steady after warning that the labor market was weaker than initial data had indicated.\nThat warning appeared prescient on Friday as markets tumbled following the report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) fell over 2% by midmorning, the Dow (DOW) shed nearly 600 points, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped around 1.6%. Meanwhile, bond prices surged on increased rate cut bets, sending the yield on the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) down 11 basis points to around 4.2%.\nAdding to labor market concerns, escalating trade tensions were also top of mind for investors as Trump hiked tariff rates on several US trading partners, including a surprise 39% tariff on Switzerland.\n\"The market had sort of put tariffs in the rearview mirror and assumed that the labor market was okay,\" Sosnick said. \"Well, both of those assumptions have been overturned quite dramatically this morning.\"\nThe strategist warned markets appear to be entering a \"reckoning period,\" explaining, \"We're not seeing a lot of reflexive dip buying. ... That, to me, tells me that the psychology, at least as of this particular moment, is a bit more tenuous than it was.\"\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misspelled Steve Sosnick's name.

      "text": "By Davide Barbuscia\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors are betting harder on a September Federal Reserve interest rate cut after last month's mild inflation bump, which indicated the pass-through from President Donald Trump's sweeping import duties to goods prices has so far been limited.\nJuly inflation numbers released on Tuesday came in largely within expectations, strengthening traders' bets the Fed will start cutting rates at its next policy meeting in September, particularly after a weak employment report in July and sharp downward revisions to job figures for May and June.\n\"I think that the market coming in was quietly expecting a hotter number, and it didn't,\" said Andrew Szczurowski, co-head of the mortgage and securitized investment team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n\"When you factor in the other side of their (the Fed's) mandate, then all of a sudden it looks like they're missing their labor target more than they're missing their inflation target,\" he said.\nRates futures traders increased bets on a 25 basis point interest rate cut in September after the data release, with the probability of a September cut rising to 98% against about 89% earlier on Tuesday, according to LSEG data.\nTwo-year Treasury yields, which tend to reflect expectations of changes in monetary policy, declined after the data and were last at 3.729%, about two basis points lower on the day.\nThe consumer price index rose 0.2% last month, in line with expectations, and rose 2.7% year on year, below consensus forecasts of 2.8%.\nTrump used the subdued headline CPI to reinforce his claim that tariffs do not hit consumers, taking aim at Goldman Sachs economists for what he said were bad predictions on the tariff impact.\nJoseph Lavorgna, counselor to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, said Tuesday's inflation figures indicated that exporters were largely absorbing tariffs by cutting prices.\n\"Every month, we keep waiting for the inflation that doesn't present itself, and then people say we need clarity. No, you've had six months in a row where the numbers have disappointed to the downside. Effectively, where you thought there would be inflation, there isn't,\" he said.\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose 0.3%, the biggest gain since January, after climbing 0.2% in June. The so-called core CPI increased 3.1% year-on-year in July after advancing 2.9% in June.\nTiffany Wilding, economist at bond manager PIMCO, said she expected core CPI to tick higher to a peak of 3.4% by year-end as tariff-related costs are passed on to consumers."

Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 3.4%, the S&P 500 rose 5.3%, and the Nasdaq was up 7.2%. For the year to date, the DJIA and the S&P 500 have turned positive, up 0.3% and 1.3%, respectively. The Nasdaq, down 0.5%, is close to moving into the green. Earnings season is winding down. The list of reports this week includes Palo Alto Networks on Tuesday; Target, TJX, Lowe's, and Zoom Communications on Wednesday; Intuit, Analog Devices, Williams-Sonoma, and Ralph Lauren on Thursday; and Nordstrom on Friday. Some 92% of S&P 500 companies have reported, and earnings for the quarter are up 14% from the prior-year quarter. That is far above the consensus call for EPS growth of about 3%-8% and follows 17% growth in 4Q24 EPS and 9% growth in 3Q24, according to LSEG. For 1Q, Healthcare is the leading sector, up 46%, and Energy is at the bottom, down 17%. For all of 2025, the Argus full-year earnings estimate is for low-double-digit growth from 2024. On the economic calendar, Existing Homes Sales are due out on Thursday and New Home Sales on Friday. As well, multiple Fed officials will speak publicly. The Economic Call of the Week from Argus' Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, is for growth in home prices to slow further. Prices of new and existing homes are reported along with home sales. On Thursday, the National Association of Realtors will report existing home sales for April. We expect sales of 4.1 million homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. On Friday, the Department of Housing and Urban Development will report new home sales for April. We expect sales of 650,000 homes at an annual rate. In March, the 'months supply' of existing homes rose to a still-healthy 4.0 months from 3.5 in February, though growth in existing home prices eased to 2.7% from 3.4% on a year-over-year basis. In the new home market, supply declined to 8.3 months in March from 8.9 in February, but prices slumped 2.9%. The Zillow Home Value Index for all homes rose 1.4% in April, compared with 2.6% in January, this as mortgage rates near 7% strain affordability. For other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure forecasts 2.4% for 2Q. This follows the surprise decline of 0.3% for 1Q GDP. The Argus 2025 GDP growth estimate has been lowered to 0.5% from 1.3%. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast forecasts a 2.4% rate for CPI in May, higher than the April rate. Mortgage rates inched higher last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.81%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices ticked down three cents to an average of $3.12 per gallon for regular gas. Looking ahead, the next Fed rate decision is on June 18, with odds at 9% for a rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. The next meeting after that is on July 30, when odds jump to 33% for a cut.\nRecent weakness provides buying opportunity\nCAVA Group, Inc., founded in 2006, owns and operates a chain of Mediterranean restaurants. The company has 10,300 employees.\nRatingPrice TargetLast week, we commented that corporate insiders had little time to react to\nLast week, we commented that corporate insiders had little time to react to the tariff-induced plunge in stock prices that took place at the very end of the April 4 trading week. But that is old news, as a suspension of tariffs on April 9 sent stocks soaring, a pullback was evident on April 10, optimism kicked in on April 11, and tariffs were modified for many technology products over the weekend. Traders reacting to the daily news flow likely have unprecedented whiplash. But so do most other investors, insiders included. But as we said above, current weekly insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research (complied before the weekend action on technology products) has morphed, and the change is exceedingly bullish. On a scale where any ratio below 2.00 is bullish, the neutral range runs from 2.00 to 6.00, and anything above 6.00 is bearish, Vickers' Total One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 1.31 (versus 2.72 last week). Drilling down to exchanges, the NYSE One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 0.95, versus 2.14, and the Nasdaq One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 1.99, versus 3.35. For comparison, the last time Vickers' one-week data was this bullish was in November of 2023. On a sector basis, insider buying exceeded selling in Consumer Discretionary last week, with shares valued at $38 million bought versus $1.5 million sold. Buying was also notable in Healthcare, as shares valued at $18 million were bought versus $10 million sold, as well as in Financials, Real Estate, and Energy. Selling was the greatest in Industrials over the last week, with shares valued at $28 million sold versus $14 million bought, as well as in Information Technology, Utilities, and Consumer Staples (though the volume of transactions in many of these sectors was low). This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Sinclair Inc. (NGS: SBGI) and Williams-Sonoma Inc. (NYSE: WSM)."

We are selective, choosing companies that we believe demonstrate growth, innovation, and strong investment potential. As such, most new stocks are rated BUY, but occasionally there is a HOLD-rated new company if we see potential. The Argus Research Fundamental Universe of Coverage includes over 500 leading U.S. and international companies. We cover the waterfront -- from Technology to Utilities from Energy to Healthcare. Generally, we follow the top 200 most widely held stocks, a list we source from our sister company Vickers Stock Research, which collects institutional ownership data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. From there, we look to identify the next 200-300 emerging U.S. and international companies to fill out our list. Our Universe of Coverage is dynamic and growing. We are continually adding stocks and often get great ideas from our clients (use https://www.argusresearch.com/ContactUs.aspx if you'd like to send us your ideas). Here are some of the additions we have made so far in 2025.\nArgus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 07/28/2025: Short-Term Trading Ideas\nMany clients of Argus Research are long-term buy-and-hold investors. As such, our proprietary BUY-HOLD-SELL ratings and target prices are established with one-year time horizons. We also have five-year ratings for even longer-term investors and pension funds. But we also have hedge fund clients that are looking for trading opportunities or for long/short portfolio ideas. The first few months of 2025, with roller-coaster ups and downs in stock prices, likely provided more opportunities for momentum traders than for fundamental investors. The list below includes some of the shorter-term trading ideas our analysts and strategists have identified recently. All the stocks listed below are rated BUY at Argus.\nFear Index Back to Normal Levels\nAfter a period of intense market volatility in the spring -- including one point at which the S&P 500 had fallen 19% from its all-time high -- the closely-watched VIX Volatility Index has declined back below its historical average of 20 as summer swings into high gear. Meanwhile, stock prices have recovered all of the lost ground and the benchmark S&P is once again setting record highs. We can't say that March-April downdraft was unexpected. Indeed, in our 2025 Market Outlook, we noted that investor complacency was high, tariffs and trade wars could slow the economy, and that stock valuations were susceptible in the event of a sell-off in the Information Technology sector. That was our Bearish Case, and certain elements may well linger for the next few months, at least. Our Base Case called for another year of growth in the U.S. economy (and no recession), declining interest rates, and double-digit EPS growth. Each of those planks in the Base Case platform is currently in place. So assuming that the Trump administration gets its economic growth plans firmly on track, there's reason to expect that equity prices can continue to climb. Back to the market, the current VIX fear index reading is south of 16, which is well below the 10-year average of 20 and consistent with a bull market. Indeed, during the long bull market in the 2010s, the VIX averaged 18 and even touched lows below 10 in 2017. We continue to think that the S&P 500 is in the early/mid-stage of a bull market that dates to October 2022. And while the path for equities won't be straight up, we suggest investors favor growth stocks in their portfolios at the current market and economic juncture.\nInitiating with intermediate- and long-term BUY ratings\nCoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, went public in March 2025. Originally a crypto mining firm, it shifted its main focus to cloud computing in 2022. The company's CoreWeave Cloud Platform, launched in 2020, has grown rapidly at a pace with AI demand. The company was an early customer for Nvidia's AI solutions and maintains a strong partnership with Nvidia. As of the end of 2024, CoreWeave operated 32 data centers with over 250,000 GPUs.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached record highs after the July CPI report indicated inflation rose less than anticipated, prompting increased bets on a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting. Meanwhile, companies like Circle and Cava faced stock declines due to disappointing earnings reports and lowered sales growth targets, respectively, while CoreWeave's strong revenue growth was overshadowed by a significant net loss.",
