      "text": "Meet Virgo, the Zodiac's helpful perfectionist: The sign's personality traits, months\nAs we transition from summer to fall, another seasonal shift is underway. Virgo season marks the entrance of the Zodiac's sixth sign, which is symbolized by the virgin or maiden.\nThose born under the earth sign are known as perfectionists and people-pleasers.\n\"Virgos have sometimes too discerning of an eye. They see things with too much clarity, and they may sometimes hone in on small details that other people are kind of brushing over,\" says astrologer Ren\u00e9e Watt.\nHere's a guide to Virgo's key traits, including their approach to relationships and career.\nVirgo dates\nVirgo season spans from August 23 to September 22.\nVirgo personality, traits\nWatt calls Virgos the \"perfectionists of the Zodiac.\"\nThose born under the sign are particular and meticulous when it comes to their actions. In turn, a Virgo may clash with a friend or partner to get them to meet their bar for perfectionism, Watt says.\nVirgos are also helpers, eager to lend a hand in any situation, almost to a fault. Virgo is the Zodiac sign that rules servitude, Watts explains. This fosters a desire to be useful, causing Virgos to put their own needs aside in service of others.\nMeet the stars: Time to wish these famous Virgo celebrities a happy birthday\nCareer\nVirgos are team-oriented and enjoy working with others, Watt says. They are said to have a connection with animals and are seen as natural healers. This may lead Virgos to pursue a career in the medical field.\nTheir perfectionism also translates into the workplace. \"They're good at excelling quickly within whatever line of work they choose because they tend to be efficient, on time and so demanding of themselves,\" explains Watt.\nVirgos are not immune to stress, however. They are one of the more outwardly stressed signs, Watt shares. Virgos rarely ask for help when they need it, preferring instead to forge ahead alone.\nVirgo compatibility\nWhen it comes to relationships, Virgos are blunt, honest and transparent, Watt says. They are communicative and pragmatic.\nVirgos are usually the first to point out holes in a friend's fantasy, offering a practical perspective. This may backfire since other signs can be temperamental and sensitive when their plans are criticized, Watt warns.\nIn romantic relationships, Virgos should be careful when choosing a partner. \"Virgos are fixers. They like to fix things.\" Watt explains.\nIt is best that Virgos don't pursue \"a partner project,\" Watt warns. \"Don't invest in someone who isn't really trying to do the work.\" It's beneficial for Virgos to find a connection that is mutually supportive.\nVirgos are an easy fit with lots of signs, Watt shares. They are a mutable sign and easily go with the flow. But Virgo's best compatibility is with Capricorn, Scorpio and Pisces.\nAstrology's 'Big Three': What your sun, moon and rising sign say about you\nStrengths\nVirgos are good in conflict and tend to remember everything. It's not wise to try and gaslight as Virgo, Watt warns. They're direct and sensible with their emotions, especially when another person denies the truth.\nVirgos love when things have order, but they don't let this interfere with others' creative freedom or expression. \"On one hand, they appreciate structure, but on the other hand, they tend to be supportive of people being able to pursue what makes them happy,\" Watt explains.\nVirgos tend to be excellent wordsmiths and are natural-born helpers, always looking to improve the world and lend a hand to a friend in need. \"Virgos want to be superheroes,\" Watts says.\nWeaknesses\nVirgos can be a bit nitpicky thanks to their perfectionism. They want people to stay out of their lane and struggle when others try to tell them what to do or mess with their sense of order, Watt says.\nVirgos can also be easily overwhelmed by the state of the world, Watt adds. They are sensitive with matters of political and environmental concern. This can drive Virgos crazy because they often let bad news or interactions stick in their psyche throughout the day.\nLearn more about each Zodiac sign\nAries | Taurus | Gemini | Cancer | Leo | Virgo | Libra | Scorpio | Sagittarius | Capricorn | Aquarius | Pisces\nNew to Astrology?

      "text": "What is my star sign? A guide the astrological signs and what yours says about you\nWhether you're meeting a new friend or going on a first date, you've likely been asked about your Zodiac, or star, sign. Some people are more astrologically inclined and well-informed on the ins and outs of their birth chart and how it affects romantic behavior, friendship longevity or even workplace habits. Others could care less.\nThis guide works for both types of people.\nAstrology and horoscopes can give further insight into your personality. They can serve as a roadmap for what drives you and how you approach the most important relationships in your life.\nBefore diving into the astrological depths, you should know your \"sun sign,\" which is determined by date of birth.\nHere's a rundown of the Zodiac's 12 signs.\nZodiac sign dates:\n- Aries: March 21 \u2013 April 19\n- Taurus: April 20 \u2013 May 20\n- Gemini: May 21 \u2013 June 21\n- Cancer: June 22 \u2013 July 22\n- Leo: July 23 \u2013 August 22\n- Virgo: August 23 \u2013 September 22\n- Libra: September 23 \u2013 October 23\n- Scorpio: October 24 \u2013 November 21\n- Sagittarius: November 22 \u2013 December 21\n- Capricorn: December 22 \u2013 January 19\n- Aquarius: January 20 \u2013 February 18\n- Pisces: February 19 \u2013 March 20\nWhat is my Zodiac sign?\nAries: March 21 \u2013 April 19\nAries is a fire sign, and it is the first in the Zodiac. Known to be competitive, those born under Aries are courageous, strong-willed and carefree. Appropriately, the sign is symbolized by the ram.\nTaurus: April 20 \u2013 May 20\nTaurus is an earth sign and is commonly associated with stubbornness. Fittingly, its symbol is the bull. Tauruses are also generous and dedicated, unafraid to take their time and resilient.\nGemini: May 21 \u2013 June 21\nGemini is an air sign and is symbolized by a set of twins. Bearers of this sign are communicative, intellectual and curious, often filling their plates so that busyness abounds.\nCancer: June 22 \u2013 July 22\nCancer is a water sign, rounding out the four elements. It is represented by the crab. Despite their hard exteriors, Cancers are deeply emotional creatures. They often experience high levels of sentimentality and compassion.\nLeo: July 23 \u2013 August 22\nLeo is a fire sign and is symbolized by the lion. They are natural-born leaders and are driven by a courageous spirit. Leos are also considered to be hard-working, confident and loyal.\nVirgo: August 23 \u2013 September 22\nVirgo is an earth sign, symbolized by a maiden (who is occasionally seen holding wheat). Virgos are said to be analytical, detail-oriented and highly practical. This occasionally leads to perfectionism. They love to help but are fierce self-critics.\nLibra: September 23 \u2013 October 23\nLibra is an air sign. Represented by scales, it's no surprise that this sign loves harmony. Libras are said to be creative and idealistic. Those born under the sign can also be indecisive and often weigh their options, struggling to commit.\nScorpio: October 24 \u2013 November 21\nShocker: Scorpio is represented by a scorpion. The water sign is known to be determined, passionate and competitive. Those born under Scorpio are also considered mysterious and intense.\nSagittarius: November 22 \u2013 December 21\nSagittarius is a fire sign, symbolized the archer. The sign is quite adventurous and free-spirited, constantly seeking travel and change. However, this carefree nature can lead to inconsistency.\nCapricorn: December 22 \u2013 January 19\nThe final earth sign, Capricorn is represented by the sea goat. Those born under the sign are seen as ambitious, practical and focused. They can be a shoulder to lean on but also can become pessimistic or cold.\nAquarius: January 20 \u2013 February 18\nAquarius is an air sign, not a water sign, despite its symbol: the water bearer. They are forward thinkers and tend to be clever, creative and intelligent. They can also be distant and struggle to express emotion.\nPisces: February 19 \u2013 March 20\nPisces is symbolized by two fish and is the last of the water signs. Those born under the sign are considered empathetic and intuitive. They can easily read the emotions of others and are ruled by their own. Pisces are understanding and romantic, experiencing the world through heightened sensitivity.\nLearn more about each Zodiac sign\nAries | Taurus | Gemini | Cancer | Leo | Virgo | Libra | Scorpio | Sagittarius | Capricorn | Aquarius | Pisces\nZodiac compatibility: What signs go well together?\nRelationships are hard enough to begin with. So, when you add star sign compatibility, things can get complex. It's not as simple as: \"Does my sign go with this other one?\"\nYou have to consider someone's full chart \u2013 their sun, moon and rising sign, along with other placements \u2013 to determine compatibility. There are, however, general rules when it comes to Zodiac compatibility.\nUsually, signs will gel with the others in their element group. For example, Gemini and Libra are both air signs and are highly compatible. Another ideal pairing is Aries and Leo, both fire signs.\nIf you're looking for your astrological match, check out our guide.\nJust Curious for more?
