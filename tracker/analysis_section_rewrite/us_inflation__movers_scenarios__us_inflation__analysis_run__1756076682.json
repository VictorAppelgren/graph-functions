      "feedback": "The analysis shows a plausible causal thread from AI-enabled productivity to ROIC/WACC pricing and equity returns, but the chain remains under-specified, under-quantified, and not clearly aligned to the exact four-item Up/Down format; it also underutilizes the regime-based probability framing (A/B/C) that sits in the sources, and several core claims lack explicit source-backed numbers. Actionable edits: restructure into exactly four one-sentence items (two Up, two Down) with the specified horizons and concrete triggers, and attach a regime-derived probability (e.g., Up ~50–60% under Regime A tilt; Down ~40–50% split between Regime B and C) drawing on NL5YYTLF2 and R3WNA7L7A; replace broad assertions like “gradual productivity gains” with quantified anchors (e.g., ROIC–WACC spreads, EV-margin trajectories, Ford/EV case figures from W2622L6WW and 22PL3Q360) and clearly cite them (6, 22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW); spell out catalysts and invalidation: tariff timelines (April/May 2025) with pass-through thresholds and GM capex milestones (4B domestic; 10–12B through 2027) plus Elevated Velocity signaling, anchored to EPJYXB7DX, WTNT85IPR, and GM, and provide explicit invalidation rules if tariff shocks exceed expected inflation pass-through or AI momentum falters (EPJYXB7DX; WTNT85IPR; 218AGGUXB); ensure every factual claim has an in-text (ID) citation and explicitly reconcile conflicts (e.g., UBI’s macro tradeoffs vs savings/autonomy) by labeling them as caveats with source notes (NL5YYTLF2); tighten the watch-list with quantifiable thresholds (tariff pass-through, AI-adoption cadence, dealer-tool uptake, and HeartSciences FDA milestones) and remove ambiguous phrasing to improve depth and credibility.",
