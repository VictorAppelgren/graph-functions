      "feedback": "The draft shows breadth and credible use of device-spec data (5S9GJV2O3) and retail/promotional signals (HWGNUP2XG, UVEQ2SJ0W) but it fails to deliver a disciplined, world‑class multi‑year framework. Actionable edits: 1) Reframe into a true horizon-oriented structure with (a) invariant anchors drawn from first principles (e.g., durable demand from AI-enabled devices, seven-year update horizons, semiconductor/imaging‑silicon cycles) and (b) explicit regimes and transition conditions (Base/Moderate AI adoption, Accelerating AI adoption, Demand/financing shock). Tie each regime to a clear causal chain: AI feature adoption and longer device lifetimes drive CAPEX demand, memory/SoC pricing, and consumer uptake, which then feeds pricing and equity risk premia. Use only IDs in SOURCE MATERIAL for every factual anchor; for example, cite 5S9GJV2O3 for Pixel/Ultra specs and seven‑year update horizon,  GRANDLY link to 5S9GJV2O3;  HWGNUP2XG and UVEQ2SJ0W for signaling in retail and M&A risk, respectively. Do not rely on anecdotal non‑tech content for the core transmission story. 2) Add a formal base-case, plus upside/downside scenarios with explicit triggers, including: (i) AI‑driven feature upgrades rolling out across Pixel/Samsung/OnePlus lines (Gemini, Pixel Studio) lifting replacement demand; (ii) charging/energy density progress affecting device price/perceived value (37W wired, 21W wireless; Pixel 9 Pro Fold heat and 21W charging); (iii) promo/tariff/cycle dynamics at large retailers (Kirkland K‑Cup signals) as a proxy for discretionary spending and inventory turns; (iv) regulatory/ fiduciary risks from DAY/BKH deal activity. Provide concrete thresholds (e.g., if AI features drive annual device-cycle replacement beyond X% of base, shift regime; if M&A risk premia rise by Y bps, tilt capex). 3) Strengthen the causal chain and quantify where possible: map from device specs (5S9GJV2O3) to ongoing semiconductor/memory demand; from seven years of updates to durable pricing and revenue visibility; from retail promo cadence (HWGNUP2XG) to marginal disposable spend and demand; from legal/activist risk (UVEQ2SJ0W) to capital allocation and financing sensitivity. 4) Increase numerical density and consistency: pair every qualitative claim with a numeric anchor from the sources (e.g., Pixel 9 Pro XL specs: 50MP primary, 48MP tele, 48MP ultrawide; 16GB RAM; 1TB storage; 37W wired, 21W wireless; seven-year updates; Pixel Fold 4,650mAh, 21W; OnePlus 13 6,000mAh; 50W magnetic charging; S25 Ultra 45W, 7‑year updates). 5) Improve conflict resolution and coverage: acknowledge any tensions (e.g., Pixel 9 Pro/XL charging differences; foldables’ heat and charging limits) and reconcile them into regime‑specific implications; explicitly note where sources diverge and why you’re giving one framing (with citations 5S9GJV2O3, HWGNUP2XG, UVEQ2SJ0W) over another. 6) Clean up scope alignment: prune or tightly justify non‑tech content (SATC/Howard Stern/NYPost opinions) as signals about discretionary consumer mood or media‑driven attention, rather than drivers of AI device markets; if retained, tether them to consumer sentiment or media multi‑asset effects with explicit caveats. 7) Deliver a crisp, formal conclusion: a base-case narrative with a quantified confidence level, a short list of watch items (AI feature cadence, lithium‑ion/charging economics, retailer promo cycles, and DAY/BKH deal signaling), and clearly defined invalidation triggers (e.g., sharp downturn in discretionary spend or a major negative regulatory/financing surprise). 8) Improve formatting and integration: present as a clean chain from invariant anchors to regime transitions to base case and risks, with each claim backed by the appropriate source IDs, and keep the prose tight to avoid conflating near-term promos with structural, multi‑year dynamics. These edits will elevate depth, coherence, and quantification, aligning with the multi‑year horizon focus and ensuring a robust, testable transmission mechanism from device ecosystems to market pricing.",
