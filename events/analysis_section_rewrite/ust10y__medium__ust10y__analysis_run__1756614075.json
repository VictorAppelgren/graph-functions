      "feedback": "Your draft is logically coherent and stays on the copper‑price theme, but tighten it by aligning every claim with the source and correcting a few timeline/details. 1) Replace “full capacity by mid‑2026” with “full capacity by 2028” to match the article’s 3‑year ramp‑up (F7K7Y35U5). 2) Add a citation to (F7K7Y35U5) after the 5–10 % price‑increase and 50–100 bp claim, noting it’s an inference from the tariff‑induced supply shock. 3) Remove the USGS inventory line (no source ID) or replace it with a citation to a relevant data source if you can find one. 4) Explicitly mention Stellantis as a key client, the plant’s role in hedging geopolitical risk, and that it will generate >50 % of overseas revenue within three years—each with a (F7K7Y35U5) citation. 5) Ensure every sentence ends with a citation; add (F7K7Y35U5) where missing. 6) Keep the watch‑list signals focused on tariff announcements, Wellascent production data, and automotive sales (all tied back to the article). 7) Finally, confirm the 3–6‑month horizon is clear: price impact window from late‑2025 to 2026, with a path‑dependent scenario that ends when tariff policy or demand shifts. This will satisfy the “no drift” rule and strengthen the evidence base.",
