  "description": "This and other changes are detailed in drafts obtained by The Washington Post.",
  "content": "The U.S. State Department is redoing its human rights reports on other countries, omitting anti-LGBTQ+ persecution, gender-based crimes, and other information the reports have traditionally included.\n\nLeaked drafts of reports reviewed by The Washington Post on El Salvador, Israel, and Russia \u201cstrike all references to LGBTQ+ individuals or crimes against them, and the descriptions of government abuses that do remain have been softened,\u201d the Post reports.\n\nThe drafts, which cover 2024, are significantly shorter than they have usually been, and they have been long delayed. The reports for the previous year are supposed to be sent to Congress by the end of February, and they are generally released to the public in March or April. Most of the reports for 2024 were nearly done by the time the Biden administration ended in January, current and former officials told the Post, but the Trump administration is now rewriting them.\n\nThe drafts seen by the Post don\u2019t mention anti-LGBTQ+ or gender-based violence. For Russia in particular, this is a \u201cglaring omission,\u201d former State Department official Keifer Buckingham told the paper. Russia has had anti-LGBTQ+ laws for more than a decade, but in recent years it has designated LGBTQ+ organizations as \u201cextremist\u201d and raided nightclubs catering to the community. It has also banned the promotion of so-called nontraditional families and adoption of Russian children by people in countries that allow gender-affirming care. In December, a travel agent arrested under the extremism law died while in jail, apparently by suicide.\n\nBuckingham criticized Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who had praised the department\u2019s human rights reports when he was a senator. \u201cSecretary Rubio has repeatedly asserted that his State Department has not abandoned human rights, but it is clear by this and other actions that this administration only cares about the human rights of some people \u2026 in some countries, when it\u2019s convenient to them,\u201d Buckingham, who is now managing director at the Council for Global Equality, told the Post.\n\nAlso, the report on El Salvador minimizes the issue of prison violence, and the one on Israel downplays political corruption and surveillance of Palestinians.\n\nThe Advocate sought comment from the State Department, which referred us to a transcript of the press briefing conducted Thursday by Thomas Pigott, the department\u2019s principal deputy spokesperson. One reporter asked him, \u201cCan you explain why the State Department is rewriting the human rights report? I understand it\u2019s coming out soon, but it\u2019s been changed and that you\u2019re dropping certain things like LGBTQ rights. Just explain why.\u201d\n\nPigott said the changes are designed \u201cto make it more readable, to make it more digestible, and also to reflect some of the changing priorities that we\u2019ve seen from the previous administration to this one, priorities that were voted by the American people and we at the State Department are here to carry out and fulfill.\u201d\n\nThe journalist then asked if the department sees human rights reporting \u201cas a political tool.\u201d Pigott replied, \u201cIt\u2019s more of just making sure that we\u2019re implementing the policy and priority of this administration. It\u2019s not political in terms of how that was described.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on Advocate: State Dept. omitting anti-LGBTQ+ actions from foreign human rights reports",

  "summary": "The U.S. State Department is redoing its human rights reports on other countries, including El Salvador, Israel, and Russia, which have been leaked to The Washington Post. The reports, which cover 2024, omits anti-LGBTQ+ persecution, gender-based crimes, and other information that have traditionally been included in the reports. This omission is seen as a \"glaring omission\" for Russia, where the country has had anti-gay+ laws for over a decade and has designated LGBTQ+ organizations as \"extremist\" and raided nightclubs catering to the community. Former State Department official Keifer Buckingham criticized Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who had previously praised the department\u2019s reports when he was a senator. The changes are designed to make the report more accessible and reflect changing priorities from the previous administration to this one, according to Thomas Pigott, the department's principal deputy spokesperson.",

      "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday signed into law separate bills targeting the LGBTQ+ community both in Russia and abroad. The new laws outlaw the promotion of non-traditional families and the adoption of Russian children by foreign nationals from countries that recognize a person\u2019s right to gender-affirming care. The bills were approved by the Russian Duma earlier this month.\nKeep up with the latest in LGBTQ+ news and politics. Sign up for The Advocate's email newsletter.\nThe adoption law effectively prohibits citizens of Australia, Austria, Argentina, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and other countries from adopting children from Russia or taking guardianship over them. Citizens of the U.S. were banned from adopting Russian children in 2012.\n\u201cThe most dangerous thing in this situation is that the state can control the absence of a gender change in potential adoptive parents only at the time of adoption on the territory of the Russian Federation,\u201d lawmakers wrote in the bill\u2019s explanatory notes, Zona Media reported at the time of the bill\u2019s passage. \u201cAnd, therefore, a foreign citizen who has adopted a child who is a citizen of Russia, after returning to the territory of the state of his citizenship, can already change the gender, but the worst thing is that he can change the gender of the adopted child, for example, by starting to use hormone replacement therapy, which is unacceptable!\u201d\nThe second law bans what it terms \u201cchildfree propaganda\u201d that promotes non-traditional families as a positive environment for children. Media companies and social media sites will be required to monitor content to ensure compliance with the law. An exemption would be made for positive portrayals of a monastic life that included celibacy.\nFailure to comply with the law would bring fines of up to 5 million rubles ($48,000).\n\u201cThese bills are designed to protect people, ensure their health and safety,\u201d Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin wrote in a post to Telegram. \u201cIt is necessary to do everything so that new generations of our citizens grow up oriented toward traditional family values.\u201d\nVolodin justified the censorship, saying that \u201cto protect people from propaganda of childlessness, it is necessary to limit the distribution of destructive content on the Internet, in the media, in movies, and advertising\u201d to protect against what he called \u201cpropaganda of pedophilia, LGBT, and gender reassignment.\u201d\n\u201cWe are talking specifically about protecting citizens, primarily the younger generation, from information disseminated in the media that negatively affects the formation of personality,\u201d Volodin wrote.\nThe new laws are part of the crackdown on the LGBTQ+ community by Russia under the rule of Putin.\nIn December of 2022, Putin signed a law strengthening a ban on LGBTQ \u201cpropaganda\u201d in Russia and making it illegal to promote same-sex sexual relations or suggest non-heterosexual attractions are \u201cnormal.\u201d Individuals can be fined up to 400,000 rubles ($6,370) for \u201cLGBT propaganda\u201d and up to 200,000 rubles ($3,185) for \u201cdemonstrations of LGBT and information that encourages a change of gender among teenagers.\u201d The fines increase to 5 million rubles ($80,000) and 4 million rubles ($64,000) respectively for legal entities.\nLast year, Putin directed sexologists in the country to treat homosexuality as a mental illness no different than bestiality and ordered the Ministry of Health to create an institute to study homosexuals at the Serbsky Center for Psychiatry and Narcology.\n\u201cThe help of such specialists is necessary if a person wants to recover from frigidity, impotence, or such violations of sexual behavior as fetishism, masochism, and sadism,\u201d the Duma reported in its official newspaper at the time.\nIn November of last year, Putin requested that the Russian government officially recognize the \u201cinternational public LGBT movement\u201d as \u201cextremist\u201d under the law, and his request was granted that same month. Less than two days later, security forces raided at least four LGBTQ+ establishments in Moscow.\nAn employee of the Central Station gay bar said police raided Club Secret, Mono Bar, and Hunters Party in Moscow, the local group SOTA reported on its Telegram channel. A fourth establishment, an unidentified gay sauna, was also raided, according to Novaya Gazeta. Video posted to social media shows a strong police presence outside one of the venues."

Sign up for The Advocate's email newsletter.\nAndrei Kotov, 48, was found dead around 4 a.m. on Sunday at the Vodnik pretrial detention center, where he was awaiting trial on charges of supporting an international LGBT extremist terrorist movement. Leisan Mannapova, Kotov\u2019s lawyer, confirmed her client died by suicide. His body was discovered in his cell covered in blood, and \u201ccuts were found\u201d on his body, an internal source told RIA Novosti.\nKotov ran Men Travel, a travel agency reportedly catering to gay men. He had recently concluded a cruise along the Volga River and was planning a trip to Egypt to ring in the New Year at the time of his arrest.\nSecurity forces arrested Kotov on Nov. 28 but it was not made public until two days later. Video of the arrest posted to multiple Telegram channels shows the muscled Kotov shirtless with his hands cuffed behind his back. Kotov testified at a court hearing earlier this month that he was beaten and threatened with a stun gun if he did not confess his alleged crimes during the arrest.\n\u201cAbout 15 people came to me at night, they beat me, hit me in the face, on the legs, left bruises,\u201d Kotov said at a detention hearing on Dec. 2, Zona Media reported at the time. \u201cI did not offer any resistance. I was extremely surprised by this procedure.\u201d\nHe told the court he was beaten by two masked men who demanded he confess to LGBT extremism. Kostov said one man punched him in the face while the second man threatened him with a stun gun. When he insisted the tours were not LGBT-centric, Kostov said he was escorted to the kitchen where he was told to say hello to the man\u2019s \u201cbrothers in the regiment.\u201d\nKotov also claimed a television reporter and camera person were on hand to ask questions on video without his permission.\nAt court, Kotov continued to deny the tours were aimed at gay men. He instead claimed the Volga River cruise was mainly about fishing and sightseeing.\n\u201cOur only appeal was that there are interesting museums, interesting hotels,\u201d Kotov testified. \u201cAll this information was only of a tourist nature.\u201d\nJudge Kristina Kostryukova denied release for Kotov over his lawyer\u2019s objections, who noted he was a vegetarian with a high caloric intake.\nThe arrest and death of Kotov comes as part of a larger crackdown on the LGBTQ+ community by the Russian government under President Vladimir Putin.\nLast month, Putin signed two new laws outlawing the promotion of non-traditional families and the adoption of Russian children by foreign nationals from countries that recognize a person\u2019s right to gender-affirming care.\nThe adoption law effectively prohibits citizens of Australia, Austria, Argentina, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and other countries from adopting children from Russia or taking guardianship over them. Citizens of the U.S. were banned from adopting Russian children in 2012.\nThe second law bans what it terms \u201cchildfree propaganda\u201d that promotes non-traditional families as a positive environment for children. Media companies and social media sites will be required to monitor content to ensure compliance with the law. An exemption would be made for positive portrayals of a monastic life that included celibacy.\nIn December of 2022, Putin signed a law strengthening a ban on LGBTQ \u201cpropaganda\u201d in Russia and making it illegal to promote same-sex sexual relations or suggest non-heterosexual attractions are \u201cnormal.\u201d Individuals can be fined up to 400,000 rubles ($6,370) for \u201cLGBT propaganda\u201d and up to 200,000 rubles ($3,185) for \u201cdemonstrations of LGBT and information that encourages a change of gender among teenagers.\u201d The fines increase to 5 million rubles ($80,000) and 4 million rubles ($64,000) respectively for legal entities.\nLast year, Putin directed sexologists in the country to treat homosexuality as a mental illness no different than bestiality and ordered the Ministry of Health to create an institute to study homosexuals at the Serbsky Center for Psychiatry and Narcology.\n\u201cThe help of such specialists is necessary if a person wants to recover from frigidity, impotence, or such violations of sexual behavior as fetishism, masochism, and sadism,\u201d the Duma reported in its official newspaper at the time.\nIn November of last year, Putin requested that the Russian government officially recognize the \u201cinternational public LGBT movement\u201d as \u201cextremist\u201d under the law, and his request was granted that same month. Less than two days later, security forces raided at least four LGBTQ+ establishments in Moscow.\nAn employee of the Central Station gay bar said police raided Club Secret, Mono Bar, and Hunters Party in Moscow, the local group SOTA reported on its Telegram channel. A fourth establishment, an unidentified gay sauna, was also raided, according to Novaya Gazeta. Video posted to social media shows a strong police presence outside one of the venues.\nIf you or someone you know needs mental health resources and support, please call, text, or chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline or visit 988lifeline.org for 24/7 access to free and confidential services.

August 7, 2025 Article Index DEPARTMENT TRADE GLOBAL HEALTH COOK ISLANDS KUALA LUMPUR LEBANON LEBANON/IRAN CHINA INDIA/CHINA LEBANON ISRAEL/PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES EUROPEAN REGION RUSSIA/UKRAINE HAITI ISRAEL/PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES RUSSIA/UKRAINE ISRAEL/PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES GLOBAL HEALTH ISRAEL/PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES INDIA ISRAEL/PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES RUSSIA/UKRAINE SYRIA/HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT ARMENIA/AZERBAIJAN T\u00dcRKIYE UZBEKISTAN AFGHANISTAN/PAKISTAN SERBIA 2:04 p.m. EDT MR PIGOTT: All right. Hello, everybody. So as normal, I\u2019ll start with some remarks up top, and then I\u2019ll move to questions after the fact. Today marks the first 200 days of the Trump Administration, and with it 200 days of delivering results and real wins for the American people. Under the leadership of President Trump and Secretary Rubio, the United States is restoring strength, securing prosperity, and standing up for American interests on the world stage. Turning to trade, President Trump has delivered on his promise to rebalance U.S. trade. This week marks the successful conclusion of eight historic trade agreements with key partners \u2013 the European Union, South Korea, Pakistan, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, China, and the United Kingdom \u2013 liberating the U.S. economy from decades of failed anti-American trade policies and delivering lasting benefits for American workers and businesses. On global health and humanitarian leadership, the United States is providing an additional $93 million to treat nearly 1 million children suffering from malnutrition with lifesaving, ready-to-use therapeutic food \u2013 RUTF \u2013 from and by American producers. This critical funding will help save lives in 13 countries \u2013 Haiti, Mali, Niger, Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan, Nigeria, Madagascar, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Kenya, and Chad \u2013 drawing down the entire prepositioned stock of RUTF and supporting continued production to meet ongoing needs. Moving to the Pacific, this week the United States and the Cook Islands announced a new partnership to advance scientific research and responsible seabed mineral development. As a regional leader, the Cook Islands is at the forefront of sustainable exploration and the United States is proud to support this shared vision for innovation and mutual prosperity. Finally, turning to Southeast Asia, the United States welcomes today\u2019s General Border Committee meeting in Kuala Lumpur as a constructive first step forward in the Cambodia-Thailand ceasefire arrangement. President Trump and Secretary Rubio call on both governments to fully honor their commitments and pursue enduring peace. We welcome Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim for his leadership in \u2013 we commend \u2013 excuse me \u2013 we commend Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim for his leadership in facilitating this process, and for co-hosting the pivotal July 28 special meeting with the United States. And with that, I\u2019ll take some questions. Yes. QUESTION: Thank you, Tommy. My name is Ali Barada from Asharq Al Awsat newspaper. And my question is that Lebanon\u2019s government today took a very critical decision regarding disarming Hizballah, and to accept in fact the U.S. proposal to solidify the cessation of hostilities with Israel. Would you please comment on that? MR PIGOTT: Yes. What I can say is the United States welcomes the Lebanese Government\u2019s decision on Tuesday to task the Lebanese Armed Forces with a plan to bring all weapons under state control by the end of the year. This is an important step towards Lebanese sovereignty. We continue to watch developments in Lebanon very closely. Special Envoy Tom Barrack made it clear what the President needs to see. As long as Hizballah retains arms, words will not suffice. The Lebanese Armed Forces must fully commit and act now to fully implement the government\u2019s decision. The credibility of Lebanon\u2019s government rests on its ability to match principle with practice. QUESTION: A quick follow-up: Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said that this decision by the Lebanese Government will fail. And I wonder whether you have some comment on that, and also whether you can tell us if Ambassador Barrack will visit Lebanon anytime soon. MR PIGOTT: Well, on that front I have nothing to preview on that. He\u2019s been in discussion with all the players in the region multiple times, as we\u2019ve discussed publicly here. What I can say again in terms of your other question is that we welcome this decision. And like I said at the end of that response, we need to see action match the principle that they\u2019re having there. So we need to see practice, not just principle. Yes. QUESTION: Thank you. My question is about China. While both the U.S. and Chinese leaders are trying to have a summit meeting in the near future, the Russian and Chinese navies carried out joint exercises in the Sea of Japan, including sub-submarine drills \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, anti-submarine drills. And China continues to purchase Russian oil. So are you concerned of the China\u2019s move that might help Russia? And I have a brief follow-up. MR PIGOTT: Well, let me take \u2013 for the specifics, let me take that back and see if we can get further details for you on that. What I can say, though, is we\u2019ve been clear about how the United States views itself as a Pacific nation; we are a Pacific nation. We\u2019ve seen the highest levels of engagement with our allies and partners across the region; the fact that we stand with our allies and partners across the region \u2013 both the Secretary, of course, going to the region, but other high-level delegations from this department over just the last few weeks. So we\u2019ve seen that engagement, we\u2019ve seen that commitment here, and that engagement will continue. QUESTION: It\u2019s been reported that Indian Prime Minister Modi sets to visit China for the first time in seven years. And Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has criticized the U.S. tariffs imposed on countries, including Brazil and India. So are you concerned that China is \u2013 China and other BRICS countries are trying to take the lead in organizing a kind of pushback against U.S. trade measures? MR PIGOTT: Well, what I can say in terms of India is the President has been very clear in terms of the concerns he has regarding the trade imbalance, regarding the concerns he has when it comes to the purchase of Russian oil. You\u2019ve seen him take action directly on that, and I refer you to the President\u2019s comments for that. India is a strategic partner with whom we engage in a full and frank dialogue. That\u2019ll continue. The Secretary also spoke to that. Like anything in foreign policy, you\u2019re not going to align a hundred percent of the time on everything, but it is very clear \u2013 the President\u2019s been clear the concerns that he has with the trade imbalance, the concerns he has with India purchasing Russian oil. He\u2019s been clear on that. He\u2019s taken action, and I refer you to his comments for further on that. Yes. QUESTION: Noting \u2013 hi. (Laughter.) MR PIGOTT: Hi. QUESTION: Hope you\u2019re doing okay. Noting your statement on Lebanon a moment ago, I mean, I know you said that the U.S. will be watching developments, but the U.S. has not been, like, a passive player in the Lebanon situation. It\u2019s been very active. Going forward, is the U.S. going to be \u2013 continue to be a broker? Is it going to take on kind of an enforcer role? I mean, how \u2013 can you give me a picture of how deeply involved you\u2019re going to be going forward here as Lebanon tries to implement the disarmament of Hizballah? MR PIGOTT: Well, obviously, we\u2019ve seen discussions from special \u2013 the \u2013 Ambassador Tom Barrack, the special envoy in the region. We\u2019ve also seen comments here on Lebanon from this podium just now and in the past. In terms of our specific role, what I can say is what I said earlier, that we\u2019ll continue to watch developments in Lebanon very closely and that we need to see the practice there match the principle that they have. QUESTION: One other question: a report today that the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation finally secured a meeting with United Nations officials \u2013 (a) can you confirm that? And (b) I know that GHF and the State Department have been calling for cooperation to happen, but never really an idea of what that cooperation would actually look like in practice. Can you give us an idea of what exactly the State Department envisions in a cooperative agreement between GHF and the UN? MR PIGOTT: Well, I refer you to GHF for more details on meetings they may or not be having with different organizations or the United Nations. What I can say is we\u2019ve been clear \u2013 is that we want to see as much aid as possible go to the people of Gaza without it being looted by Hamas. We\u2019ve been clear that we want to see creative solutions, that there\u2019s a mechanism in place that has been able to deliver 110 million meals without it being looted by Hamas. We\u2019ve also been clear in our concerns about how other different delivery systems have seen issues when it comes to the diversion of aid. So the specifics we\u2019ll see \u2013 the President has talked about wanting to see more aid get into Gaza. We\u2019ve seen, for example, from this podium talking about how the ambassador and Special Envoy Witkoff have briefed the President after their recent trip to the region. We\u2019ll see what specifics come out in terms of future steps, but there are many options being discussed. We want to see as much aid get to the people of Gaza without it being looted by Hamas as possible. Yes. QUESTION: A question about Europe. It has been reported in the past hours that the United States Government has launched a diplomatic campaign targeting the European Union\u2019s Digital Services Act. According to this reporting, the United States will be arguing that it\u2019s excessive \u2013 it\u2019s imposing excessive restrictions on free speech. And given the ongoing negotiations between the United States and the European Union, could you confirm that that campaign is active? And what would be the main motivation and the outcome that the United States would like to see regarding the DSA? MR PIGOTT: In terms of negotiations, are you referring to trade on that front? QUESTION: Yeah. MR PIGOTT: So in terms of specifics on the trade negotiations, I refer you to USTR, the White House, and those directly involved in those negotiations. We have been clear from the beginning of this administration the importance this administration places on free speech. That is something that the Vice President spoke to in Munich when he said, \u201cDemocracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters\u2026 We shouldn\u2019t be afraid of our people, even when they express views that disagree with their leadership.\u201d This has been an honest and frank conversation that we have been having with our partners in Europe, around the world \u2013 the importance that we place on free speech \u2013 and that importance is going to continue. Yes. QUESTION: Thank you. Asking about President Trump and the potential summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, I know White House officials have said that for that meeting to take place, Putin needs to be willing to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But I was wondering, can you put a fine point on that? Is there any world in which this summit between President Trump and President Putin can happen without Putin agreeing to a Zelenskyy meeting as well? MR PIGOTT: Well, I\u2019m going to refer you to the White House on that one for details on the President\u2019s schedule. What I can say is looking backwards, as the Secretary has described, we have been in continual communication with our partners in Europe, continual communication with Ukraine. Our ultimate goal is to end this conflict, get the parties to the table, see the ceasefire and the long and enduring peace. But for details on the President\u2019s schedule, I\u2019ll refer you to the White House. Yes. QUESTION: Thank you, Tommy. Rachel with (inaudible) Broadcasting. Good to see you. In regards to Ukraine, does the Secretary have any \u2013 maybe scheduling a chance meeting with his counterpart, with Ukrainian officials, or with any Russian officials? MR PIGOTT: I have nothing to preview in terms of his schedule at this point. QUESTION: Okay. And then you \u2013 real quick on Haiti, you mentioned that millions of dollars are going to go towards the malnutrition problem in Haiti. However, the State Department could potentially deport thousands of people \u2013 Haitians that are currently residing in the United States \u2013 back to Haiti. There\u2019s still political instability there. What does the State Department have to say about that? MR PIGOTT: Well, look, we\u2019ve seen actions from this administration in order to try to encourage stability in Haiti. We\u2019ve seen actions, announcements taken to try to go after those that are leading to instability in Haiti, announcements the Secretary himself has made. We see this aid from American producers, by American producers going to these 13 countries. For specifics of TPS, I assume that you\u2019re talking about \u2014 QUESTION: Yes, sir. MR PIGOTT: I\u2019d refer you to DHS in terms of those specific decisions. But we have seen actions here from the State Department that try to encourage stability in Haiti. We\u2019ve seen, again, this announcement of aid going to Haiti and other countries as well. QUESTION: Thank you. MR PIGOTT: Yes. QUESTION: Thank you, Tammy. Wanted to ask \u2013 Tommy, apologies. I wanted to follow up on \u2014 MR PIGOTT: It is tough. It \u2013 my phone sometimes autocorrects to Tammy nowadays. QUESTION: Just bad habit. MR PIGOTT: So my own phone does it. I don\u2019t know. QUESTION: A follow up on Russia-Ukraine again. What is your level of trust to Putin, that he is not engaging in another delaying tactic here? And how overoptimistic \u2013 or will it be overoptimistic for us to expect anything out of this meeting, potential meeting? MR PIGOTT: Well, it\u2019s not a question of trust. It\u2019s a question of actions. The President has described how he\u2019s been disappointed in the actions that we have seen from Russia over recent weeks. He\u2019s talked about needing seeing actions, not just words. He\u2019s described that himself. So this is not a question of trust, per se. This is a question of seeing actions to match up the words but also is indicative of the commitment that we have made clear from the beginning of this administration that we stand ready to aid in the pursuit of peace to try to end this conflict, stop the carnage. That is our driving policy here. That remains our driving policy. And getting the sides to the table is key to reaching a diplomatic solution to this conflict. So it\u2019s not about trust. It\u2019s about action and it\u2019s about doing everything we can to aid in the pursuit of peace and bring this war to an end. QUESTION: And to follow up on Russia again, today marks 17 years since Russia invaded Georgia. They are holding Georgian land. They have successfully, it seems to have, implanted there pro-Russian Government that is cracking down against Georgian opposition, civil society. So do you have any comment on both Russian occupation and also Georgian Government\u2019s behavior? MR PIGOTT: The United States Embassy in Georgia put out a statement. I refer you to that statement for further details there. Yes. QUESTION: Thank you, Tommy. Following up once again on Russia-Ukraine, you talk about the goal of a peaceful solution. What\u2019s at stake if we can\u2019t get that peaceful solution from a potential upcoming meeting, if negotiations go nowhere? MR PIGOTT: Well, I\u2019m not going to speculate on what may came out of these meetings. I\u2019m not going to predict the future. What I can talk about, again, is our commitment now \u2013 what we have done, what we continue to do \u2013 engagement at the highest levels of this administration to try to end this conflict and stop the carnage. We stand ready, like I said, to aid in the pursuit of peace. We continue to do that. So I\u2019m not going to speculate or predict the future, but I can talk about that commitment we\u2019ve seen already and continue to see. Yes. QUESTION: Thank you, Tommy. On the West Bank. I\u2019m sorry? QUESTION: (Off-mike.) QUESTION: Okay. Again, thank you, Tommy. On the West Bank \u2013 it\u2019s been much in the news. We\u2019ve seen legislators go and visit the settlements and so on, illegal settlements, and talk about settlements. We know that the Speaker of the House was shown actually a plan for an annexation. Now a group of Israeli (inaudible) issued a paper. They said that the West Bank is actually being annexed very quietly and so on, and the settlers are targeting some villages where a lot of Palestinian Americans go, because they go and they build homes and so on to basically discourage development of the West Bank. My question to you: What kind of designation do you assign to the Palestinians in the West Bank and under occupation? Are they an occupied people? What status do they have? Do they occupy, let\u2019s say, part of \u2013 or they autonomy, partial autonomy or whatever? So can you please give us, if you have, a position on what designation the Palestinians have in the West Bank? We\u2019d love to hear it. MR PIGOTT: Well, the position that we do have is that we want to see a stable West Bank that keeps Israel secure and is in line with this administration\u2019s goal to achieve peace in the region. Within the short term, we remain focused on ending the war in Gaza. QUESTION: In Gaza. I understand. MR PIGOTT: Then once we have broader discussions in terms of what we may see that leads to longer peace and prosperity in the region \u2013 I\u2019m not going to preview those here. But we have continually decried violence in the West Bank from this podium and elsewhere, no matter who commits it. And we want to see a stable West Bank that, again, keeps in line \u2013 keeps Israel secure and is in line with our ultimate goal to see a prosperous region. QUESTION: Now the family of Khamis Ayyad, who \u2013 the Palestinian American that was killed last week, have requested the State Department or the U.S. Government to investigate the circumstances of his death. He died as a result of fire and smoke inhalations that were started by the settlers. Have you talked to the Israelis about this? Do you have any result? Do you trust their investigation? MR PIGOTT: Well, look, I refer you to comments that Spokesperson Tammy Bruce made at this podium \u2014 QUESTION: Right. MR PIGOTT: \u2014 just a few days ago. I\u2019ll also repeat here that we have no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people. QUESTION: Okay. MR PIGOTT: Yes. QUESTION: Thank you, Thomas. I have two questions. One is related to Europe and the relationship with the U.S. So we have seen in the war in Ukraine a big division in Europe and the inability to sort it out. And how much the issue that we\u2019re seeing in Europe \u2013 this division \u2013 force the President of the United States to take it over and say, hey, I have to deal with this and try to meet Putin because the European were unable to kind of put on the table Zelenskyy and Putin? MR PIGOTT: Well, the President has been clear he wants to see our European partners step up in a variety of different areas. We saw, for example, the recent NATO deal in terms of weapons being sold to NATO and then they can then give those weapons to who they wish. The President is a dealmaker, as the Secretary was describing just yesterday. He is a dealmaker, and he is able to reach deals on behalf of the American people that \u2013 but then also that lead to a safer world. So the President stands ready, like I said, to aid in the pursuit of this peace. But he has also been clear that we want to see, we need to see our European partners stepping up in terms of defense spending, in terms of a whole variety of other measures here. And that remains, in terms of needing to see our European partners also step up. QUESTION: Yeah. And if I can ask you on the other front, will the \u2013 the United States will be involved on the Gaza and Israeli situation besides the humanitarian foundation? Are there in place any other plan to try to bring to this war to an end, besides diplomacy? MR PIGOTT: Well, so I\u2019m not going to preview what decision the President may make. I already described how he was briefed following the trip \u2013 Special Envoy Witkoff and Ambassador Huckabee. There\u2019s been several different options that have been discussed. The main driver here is creative solutions. We want to see creative solutions, and we want to see a mechanism in place that delivers aid to the people of Gaza without it being looted by Hamas, without seeing aid diversion. That is the primary goal that we\u2019re having here. That\u2019s what we want to see. And we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve been calling for creative solutions in order to get to that end. We\u2019ve supported the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation because that mechanism \u2013 it is a mechanism in which that has been allowed to happen, 110 million meals that have been delivered to the people of Gaza \u2014 QUESTION: Yeah. MR PIGOTT: \u2014 without it being diverted or looted, stolen by Hamas. So we\u2019re continuing to call for creative solutions. We want to see more people involved. We want to see partnerships, but based under a mechanism that allows aid to reach the people that need it. QUESTION: Thank you. MR PIGOTT: Yes. QUESTION: Want to ask two questions. First, just following up on your topper, can you tell us a little bit more about when you expect the RUTF to actually move? And can you clarify \u2013 is this the same food aid that was previously frozen as part of the review? MR PIGOTT: Well, this \u2013 we had another announcement on food aid. I\u2019m not entirely sure what you\u2019re referring to there specifically, but there have been two recent announcements on food. What I can say in terms of this proposal is that this proposal is for 11,285 additional metric tons of RUTF under this award. In terms of these commodities are currently held in warehouses operated by the RUTF and they\u2019re produced by producers in Rhode Island or Georgia. The details of this specific procurement are sensitive. It is ongoing. We\u2019ve announced this intent to have the $93 million worth of drawing down and then additional procurement. When we have additional information in terms of exact timing, we can provide it. QUESTION: Sorry, Tommy \u2014 QUESTION: And can I have one more on \u2014 QUESTION: \u2014 did you just say that on this specifically this is stuff that was \u2013 your comments said that you\u2019re drawing down the entire stock of prepositioned supplies. MR PIGOTT: And then replacing it as well. So it\u2019s \u2014 QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah. MR PIGOTT: Yeah. QUESTION: But all of this stock that you\u2019re distributing \u2013 this 11,285 tons \u2013 was actually purchased and sent to these warehouses in the previous administration; is that correct? MR PIGOTT: Well, I\u2019ll find out exactly when it was sent. I know that there\u2019s the 11,285 metric \u2013 additional metric tons. So in terms of the breakdown of how much of that is additional versus prepositioned, I can\u2019t speak to now. QUESTION: But you said it was additional. An additional 93 million. Okay. But \u2014 MR PIGOTT: Yeah, excuse me. That was request for proposals to producers for the additional 11,285 metric tons. QUESTION: So that\u2019s all going to be new? MR PIGOTT: That was the request for proposal for additional metric tons. That is what I have here. In terms of making sure I get you the exact specifics on the numbers I can \u2013 yeah. QUESTION: I just want to know if this is \u2013 if this is food assistance that this administration has put into these warehouses or if it was food assistance that was put in under the previous administration, some of which as we know was destroyed. MR PIGOTT: Yeah. So I \u2013 as I was going through the numbers, I do have a breakdown here. A benefit of having some notes here. So the entire prepositioned stock of RUTF is 1,209 metric funds, but the funding will also be used to order the production of an additional 11,285 metric tons. QUESTION: Thank you. QUESTION: Can I follow up on the one other question? Now that the Israeli prime minister has confirmed in a Fox interview his intention to occupy all of Gaza, can you speak a little bit more on the U.S. position on this? Do you see this as a way that is helpful to secure the release of the hostages still being held there and to see humanitarian aid flow? MR PIGOTT: Well, what I can speak to is our policy and our initiatives here. And our three focuses, as the Secretary outlined yesterday, remain getting humanitarian aid into Gaza without it being looted by Hamas, remains seeing the hostages released, and remains making sure that Hamas cannot continue to exist, because there can be no long-term prosperity with Hamas as a governing force or otherwise within Gaza. So that\u2019s what our policy is. That\u2019s where our focus is. That\u2019s what I can speak to. For further details on Israel\u2019s policy, I would refer you to the Government of Israel. Yes. QUESTION: Yes, thank you, Tommy. I wanted to follow up on my colleague\u2019s question about India, because I understand the \u2013 we\u2019ve certainly heard, as you mentioned, the President\u2019s frustration and upset about India purchasing Russian oil. But we\u2019ve seen a longer-term tension, it seems, rising in U.S.-India relationship. We saw Indian officials back in May who were upset about the President talking about \u2013 talking publicly about a role in having brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. We saw the meeting with the prime minister of India that was supposed to take place at the G7 in June canceled because the President had to leave early to return to Washington. And now this tension over tariffs. Is there a concern from this department or the Secretary about an overall worsening in the relationship with India and the potential for India to be turning more to China and away from the U.S. at a time when the U.S. looks to India, has been looking for many years to India, as a partner? MR PIGOTT: Well, what this is about is an honest, full, and frank dialogue about real concerns that this administration has, that the President has outlined very clearly \u2013 addressing those concerns through his actions. He\u2019s spoken about them, whether it\u2019s about the purchase of Russian oil, whether it\u2019s about the trade imbalance. Addressing those concerns is important, and that\u2019s part of what it means to have a frank dialogue \u2013 to address those concerns that you have \u2013 and then hopefully have conversations to see those concerns addressed. So the President\u2019s been very clear; his concerns about what he has seen from India speak for themselves. He\u2019s truthed multiple times about it. But ultimately, this is about a frank and full dialogue, and that\u2019s what it means to advance American interests. That\u2019s what it means to really have full diplomatic dialogue with partners \u2013 to address concerns that we need to see addressed. QUESTION: Can we go back of the room? MR PIGOTT: Yes. QUESTION: Thanks, Tommy. Earlier today the President truthed \u2013 and this is (inaudible) truth \u2013 that he was hoping that all our nations would join the Abraham Accords. Do you see \u2013 do you have concern that Israel\u2019s decision to take over Gaza completely will, if not delay, really kind of jeopardize the ability to move forward with the Abraham Accords? MR PIGOTT: Well, I\u2019m not going to predict the future or speak for the opinions of other governments. What I can say is that President Trump is a deal-maker. President Trump wants to see peace and constructive dialogue. He knows how to make a deal. He knows how to bring people to the table. That has been evident both in the previous administration when we saw the beginning of the Abraham Accords and now the Abraham Accords then being something that many people thought would not have been possible, and yet he still was able to accomplish that, with many different nations joining the Abraham Accords. So I think what\u2019s clear is that the President can accomplish what many people think is not possible. I\u2019m not going to predict the future or speculate on how others may view certain actions. But the President remains committed on this; he\u2019s made that clear. Yes. QUESTION: Hi, Tommy. Thank you. In his interview yesterday, Secretary Rubio made it clear that \u2013 of Russia and Ukraine \u2013 the U.S. would have to bring them close enough in order for a meeting involving President Trump to be worthwhile and productive. As of right now, are they close enough? MR PIGOTT: Well, I\u2019m not going to get ahead of what the White House may announce here. I mean, ultimately the Secretary laid out saying that that was one of the things that they were discussing here when we\u2019re looking towards a potential meeting or other sort of engagement. So I will leave that to the White House or the President to decide when that happens and take his lead here, and it is a credit to his leadership that we\u2019ve seen the engagement we have seen, the parties come to the table when they have come to the table, and the further engagement to try to pursue peace here. QUESTION: Assuming that you\u2019re not close enough and there is no ceasefire in place by tomorrow, which was the previously stated deadline in order to forestall sanctions by the U.S., are sanctions going to be imposed tomorrow, either secondary or any other sort? MR PIGOTT: A lot of speculation involved there. I\u2019m not going to speculate from here. QUESTION: I mean, it was a pretty hard deadline by the President. So \u2013 and administration officials had indicated they were expected to be put in place. MR PIGOTT: Well, as you said, assuming \u2013 that\u2019s kind of where I draw the line in terms of speculation. QUESTION: Yeah. MR PIGOTT: I\u2019ll defer to the White House to speak more to the President, and defer to the President \u2013 don\u2019t want to get ahead of him. But not going to speculate from here. QUESTION: One last fine \u2013 finer-point question. The Secretary also, in this interview, indicated that Special Envoy Witkoff heard from the Russians about what they were asking for in order to bring an end to the war. Did they put any concessions on the table? MR PIGOTT: Well, as the Secretary described in his interview, yesterday we saw conditions, which is the first time, as he described, that we have seen some of these conditions that would be needed to see an end to this war. I\u2019ll leave it to him to characterize what we saw from the Russians \u2013 and \u201cconditions\u201d is the word that he used. QUESTION: On the Human Rights Report? MR PIGOTT: Yes. QUESTION: Thank you. Thanks, Tommy. Two questions on Syria. As President Trump has instructed the State Department to review the removal of Syria\u2019s Sponsor of Terrorism status, will that happen soon? And would \u2013 what would that mean in terms of sanctions? MR PIGOTT: Sorry, repeat your question one more time. QUESTION: Yeah. President Trump has instructed the State Department to review the removal of the Syrian Sponsor of Terrorism status. Will that happen soon? And what would that mean in terms of sanctions? MR PIGOTT: Well, I\u2019m not going to preview the finalization of certain sanctions announcements. When we have something to announce, we\u2019ll announce it. What I can say is, as the President has said, as Special Envoy Barrack has said, as the Secretary has said, we want to give Syria a chance for greatness, and that Syria is at a critical crossroads here when it comes to the ability to see \u2013 to achieve that. So we continue in dialogue here. We continue having the conversations with all different stakeholders in the region. When we have something to announce, we\u2019ll announce it. QUESTION: And the second question, as you are mediating the negotiation between the Syrian Democratic Forces and the Syrian Government, have you seen any progress in these negotiations recently? And last week, Tammy said that the U.S. position has not changed on the evolution of these negotiations. Can you clarify that the \u2013 whether the U.S. dictating the Syrians and SDF in these negotiations, or if you are leaving that for the Syrians to make decision if they want a federal state or if they want to have a centralized state? MR PIGOTT: Well, Special Envoy Barrack has spoken about this. I\u2019m not going to go further than his comments in terms of talking about sensitive conversations between different parties. I refer you to his comments on more detail there. Yes, Michele, in the back. QUESTION: Thank you. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m turning my back. Can you explain why the State Department is rewriting the Human Rights Report? I understand it\u2019s coming out soon, but it\u2019s been changed and that you\u2019re dropping certain things like LGBTQ rights. Just explain why. MR PIGOTT: Yeah, what I can say is that this Human Rights Report, in terms of the one that is set to come, just for people watching at home, is set to talk about 2024. It is a series of reports for different countries. Part of the reason why we are seeing an effort to readjust this is to make it more readable, to make it more digestible, and also to reflect some of the changing priorities that we\u2019ve seen from the previous administration to this one, priorities that were voted by the American people and we at the State Department are here to carry out and fulfill. So we\u2019re seeing an ongoing conversation in regards to that. We\u2019re seeing an effort in order to try to make this more usable, more readable while also reflecting the changing priorities of this administration compared to the last one. QUESTION: So it\u2019s always in the past seen as not a political thing. I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re judging people based on human rights law. But does this mean that you see it as a political tool? MR PIGOTT: No, not at all. I mean, we have seen changes in the previous administration when President Biden took office, changes in terms of different examples that are used. Speaking of past reports, the examples in these reports are oftentimes illustrative, highlights of ways that we want to \u2013 or concerns we want to raise or conversations we want to have. So no, it\u2019s more of just making sure that we\u2019re implementing the policy and priority of this administration. It\u2019s not political in terms of how that was described. Yes. QUESTION: Thank you, Tommy. A couple of questions on Azerbaijan and Armenia. First, there are reports that the trilateral summit on Friday at the White House with Azerbaijan and Armenian leaders will result in the signing of an initial peace deal. Can you confirm? Could you please elaborate on that? And also, could you please clarify the U.S. position on this Zangezur Corridor, this transit corridor? MR PIGOTT: Well, on that second point, let me see if I can get you more details there. On your first, I refer you to the White House for details on what will happen. It may or may not be happening on \u2013 yeah. QUESTION: And on T\u00fcrkiye, like, how do you see T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s role in this? We know that Turkish President Erdogan recently both \u2013 separately, met both with Armenian and Azerbaijan leaders. How has \u2013 how does the U.S. see T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s role in this peace process, and also generally, overall, its role in a post-conflict regional order? MR PIGOTT: Well, what I can say is that both the President and the Secretary have said we hope to see, speaking in general, some sort of agreement soon. They\u2019ve both said that multiple times. The Secretary often talks about this when he has the opportunity. When there\u2019s something to announce, we\u2019ll announce it. And in terms of the specifics of how that looks, when we have something to announce in terms of specifics, I\u2019m not going to speculate or get ahead of those announcements at this time. Yes. QUESTION: Me? MR PIGOTT: Yes. QUESTION: Oh, thank you so much. My name is Yerdana from Khabar Agency. U.S. ambassador to Uzbekistan, Mr. Jonathan Henick, said that it\u2019s the best time for Donald Trump to visit Central Asia. I know you don\u2019t speak for the President, but this year is 10th anniversary of C5+1 platform, where Central Asian five countries engage with United States to make the relationship more fruitful. So do you have any plans to do for this year? Because it\u2019s already August and we have, like, three months left. Anything planned for United States and Central Asia cooperation? MR PIGOTT: Well, nothing to preview at this point in terms of scheduling there. Yes. QUESTION: Thank you. My name is Nazira Karimi. I\u2019m Afghan journalist. I have two questions, sir. One question is: Any update about U.S. policy toward Taliban, Taliban regime? Number two: Foreign minister of Taliban had a plan to visit Pakistan. There is rumor that United States stop him, prevented his visa. Is it true? And my second question: President Trump said that we are going to help Afghan allies to come to the United States, the people who has a SIV visa. Which kind of help U.S. authority will prepare for them? Because a lot of them waiting in Doha, Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Pakistan, and different part of country. Thank you. MR PIGOTT: So a couple questions there. I believe on your second regarding Pakistan, I\u2019m not going to comment on rumors from this podium. QUESTION: Visas, Muttaqi\u2019s visas, yes. MR PIGOTT: Yeah, so I\u2019m not going to comment on rumors from this podium. In terms of your question on SIVs, we see a continual processing of SIVs. That processing has continued. That has continued for many, many years. We have seen that because of the initiatives, as President Trump was talking about. So the SIV processing has continued. We expect that to continue. But also, we\u2019re seeing many hundreds of those visas being processed as we go forward here. So nothing further beyond that, but the processing for SIVs for Afghans does continue. QUESTION: Thank you. MR PIGOTT: Yes. QUESTION: Thank you. I would like to ask you about Serbia. Secretary Rubio had a meeting with Serbian officials yesterday. Can you please provide some details beyond the readout that I\u2019m familiar with, specifically on Secretary Rubio\u2019s broader plans for U.S.-Serbia relations and the strategic policy framework surrounding the engagement. Like, what\u2019s the goal for the State Department when it comes to Serbia? Is it the beginning of a new chapter? Is it not? What do you have for me? MR PIGOTT: Well, nothing further to provide beyond the readout, so I\u2019ll refer you to that readout for further information. And with that, that\u2019s all I have for today. Thank you. QUESTION: Thank you.
