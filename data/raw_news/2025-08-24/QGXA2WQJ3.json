  "title": "Shopify Stock Popped 22% After Earnings. Is it Too Late to Buy?",
  "description": "Key PointsShopify's site and ecosystem continue to attract more merchants.",
  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None Shopify's site and ecosystem continue to attract more merchants.\n\u2022 None Gross merchandise volumes and revenue are growing at a rapid pace.\n\u2022 None Whether Shopify looks \"expensive\" may depend on the metric one chooses.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Shopify \u203a\n\nShopify (NASDAQ: SHOP) is on fire. After its Aug. 6 earnings report for the second quarter of 2025, the stock popped 22%. The stock has retreated since then, but it is still up by more than 80% over the last year.\n\nAlthough such gains are impressive, they could also lead to concerns over the stock and its valuation. Investors need to take a closer look at Shopify stock to see whether now is a good time to add shares, or whether they should stand pat or possibly sell.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nShopify has become the leading company among e-commerce platform providers. It first stood out by offering a no-code, highly customizable site that non-programmers could set up and launch. The company enhanced this ease of use by also emphasizing speed, making it more user-friendly and less likely that e-retailers would lose sales due to a slow website.\n\nMoreover, it also built an ecosystem that helped online merchants with ancillary tasks such as payments, email marketing, and, more recently, AI tools such as Sidekick and Shopify Magic. Since sales platforms are not particularly unique, the ecosystem gives Shopify a competitive advantage that its clients will not find on most other platforms.\n\nThese capabilities helped make Shopify stock a pandemic darling, and it had a peak closing price of more than $169 per share in 2021. Unfortunately, the stock sold off in the 2022 bear market, and this was exacerbated by an attempt to build a Shopify Fulfillment Network (SFN). Consequently, it lost as much as 87% of its value as it returned to losses.\n\nThe company later decided that building such a network was too costly and a poor fit for what is otherwise a software company. After selling the SFN to Flexport in 2023, profitability soon returned, and the stock began moving higher.\n\nThat bull market has largely continued. Today, the stock is only about 20% below its all-time closing high.\n\nThanks to that growth, Shopify generated nearly $163 billion in gross merchandise volume in the first half of 2025, rising 27% yearly. That generated just over $5.0 billion in revenue in the first two quarters of 2025, a 29% yearly surge.\n\nKeeping expense growth in check led to a 51% rise in operating income. Unfortunately, unrealized losses weighed on its performance in Q1. Thus, its net income was just $224 million in the first half of 2025, though that was an improvement over the $102 million loss in the same year-ago period.\n\nAdditionally, the company forecasts revenue growth of a mid-to-high-20s percentage rate, which should bode well for its net income. That helped stoke the aforementioned 22% pop in the stock following earnings.\n\nStill, investors should note that the stock has become expensive by some measures. The stock's P/E ratio is around 70, and measuring the valuation by the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 18 confirms this is a pricey stock. Still, such valuations are not unheard of for tech-oriented growth stocks, indicating Shopify could still attract buyers.\n\nIs it too late to buy Shopify stock?\n\nConsidering the company's growth in valuation, it is probably not \"too late\" to buy the stock, though it could face struggles in the near term.\n\nIndeed, Shopify has stood out over most of its competition with its fast, easy-to-use sales site and a support ecosystem increasingly geared toward AI. That is driving considerable increases in gross merchandise value and, by extension, revenue levels.\n\nThat has taken the stock higher, along with its valuation. Admittedly, with the P/E ratio at 70 and the 18 P/S ratio, it could add to the risk of a near-term pullback. Still, such valuations have not necessarily deterred growth investors, making any longer-term pullback less likely.\n\nThus, interested investors can profit by adding shares now, though they should probably proceed carefully.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Shopify right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Shopify, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Shopify wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $649,657!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,090,993!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,057% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 185% for the S&P 500. Don\u2019t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n\nWill Healy has positions in Shopify. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Shopify.

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "Revenue is many things. Commonly known as sales, it\u2019s the top line of the income statement as well as a key financial metric that investors use to measure the financial health of a business. Like any financial metric, there are also rules underpinning the way it\u2019s measured and recorded, and investors should be familiar with these revenue recognition principles.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is revenue?\nPut simply, revenue is a business\u2019s gross income or the amount of money it brings in from regular operations before costs are considered. In some businesses, revenue is referred to as sales, though it can also come in the form of commissions, premiums, subscriptions, and credit card fees, as well as other channels, depending on the type of business in question.\nRevenue is often used as one way of measuring the size of a business, and investors tend to look at revenue growth as a reflection of a business\u2019s growth rate. Along with profits, or net income, revenue is generally one of the two most important metrics that investors look at in the income statement.\nUnderstanding revenue\nUnderstanding revenue\nRevenue might seem like a simple concept, but the way it\u2019s recorded isn\u2019t always straightforward, and how it\u2019s recorded often depends on the type of business.\nFor some businesses, like retail, revenue is typically recorded when a sale is made, but for other businesses, like software, it\u2019s more complicated. In accrual accounting, the basis for an income statement, revenue is recorded when a service is provided, not when it\u2019s paid for. So the timing of revenue recognition can differ significantly from the timing of cash collection, depending on the type of business and how customers pay their bills. In contract-based businesses like software, customers may pay up front for some products or pay after the services have been provided.\nAccrual accounting is designed to smooth out the lumps that are common in cash-based accounting, making revenue a useful indicator of how a business is performing. However, it\u2019s a good idea to keep an eye on cash flow to make sure that revenue is being converted into cash.\nCash Flow\nHow to use it\nHow to use revenue\nRevenue is a valuable tool for investors, and there are a number of ways it plays into financial analysis. One common usage is in the price-to-sales ratio, which values a stock based on how the share price compares to revenue per share.\nFor profitable companies, investors typically prefer to use the price-to-earnings ratio, but the price-to-sales ratio can help complete the valuation picture since profit margins can vary from quarter to quarter, and profit growth relies on revenue growth. For companies in sectors like software that may not have profits, the price-to-sales ratio is especially valuable since it shows how expensive the stocks are and how they compare to others.\nRevenue growth is also a key metric for investors. In general, revenue growth is the best metric to use to assess a company\u2019s growth rate and potential. Although revenue has to ultimately translate into profits, a stock\u2019s value is closely tied to its top-line growth rate since that offers an indication of the demand for a company\u2019s products and its potential for expansion.\nRelated investing topics\nHow it's calculated\nHow revenue is calculated\nAt its most basic level, revenue is calculated as price multiplied by the quantity sold. If a restaurant sold 20 hamburgers for $10, its revenue would be $200.\nFor most companies, which have multiple product lines and different businesses, calculating revenue is more complex, and the underlying concept is straightforward. Revenue is money that comes in from normal business operations. That\u2019s separate from one-time gains like stock sales, legal proceeds, or interest income for non-financial companies.\nUnderstanding revenue is a valuable tool for any investor, especially as we look forward to the next bull market. Knowing the different ways that businesses recognize revenue is helpful for analyzing individual sectors. Comparing the cash flow statement with revenue is also important to make sure businesses are converting their revenue into cash.\nFinally, looking at metrics like the price-to-sales ratio and revenue growth can help guide your investments; both of those key metrics start with revenue."

      "text": "On a company\u2019s income statement, also called its profit and loss statement, you\u2019ll find net income near the bottom. Net income is a critically important metric that investors must understand to have a good idea of a company\u2019s profitability.\nWhat is net income?\nWhat is net income?\nIn simple terms, a company\u2019s net income is revenue minus all expenses. Starting with total revenue, follow these steps to calculate net income:\n- Subtract cost of goods sold, or COGS. These are the direct costs associated with producing and delivering products and services that have already been sold. This yields gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue is the gross margin.\n- Subtract operating expenses. These include costs associated with sales, marketing, research and development, administrative functions, and other areas that support the business. Operating expenses also include any one-time costs, such as restructuring charges and inventory write-downs. This yields operating income. Operating income as a percentage of revenue is the operating margin.\n- Subtract interest expenses. A company in debt, whether through bank loans or outstanding bonds, will generally have to pay interest on that debt.\n- Subtract other miscellaneous expenses. This can include a wide variety of items, which vary from company to company. This yields pre-tax income.\n- Subtract income tax expense. When a company produces a positive pre-tax income, it is generally required to pay income taxes. This yields net income, or net profit. Net income as a percentage of revenue is the net profit margin.\nUnderstanding net income\nUnderstanding net income\nWhen someone talks about a company\u2019s \u201cbottom line,\u201d they\u2019re usually talking about net income. A positive net income tells you that a company has turned a profit; a negative net income, or net loss, indicates that a company is unprofitable.\nNet income is an accounting figure. Companies generally use accrual accounting, under which payments and expenses show up when they\u2019re earned or incurred. A payment that a company receives is only counted as revenue when that company actually delivers the product or service, not when the payment hits the company\u2019s bank account.\nExpenses are treated the same way. For example, the COGS associated with an item is only recorded when that item is sold, regardless of whether payment has been received, not when it\u2019s produced. COGS also includes non-cash expenses such as depreciation, while operating expenses include non-cash expenses such as stock-based compensation.\nA piece of the puzzle\nA piece of the puzzle\nNet income is a useful and essential profitability metric, but it\u2019s not the only one. For example, it does not represent the amount of cash a company generates.\nFor a full understanding of a company\u2019s profitability, pairing net income with free cash flow is your best bet. Net income is found on the income statement; free cash flow is found on the cash flow statement. Free cash flow measures the amount of cash that a company generates through operating activities in a given period.\nAnother thing to note about net income is that it can sometimes be a poor representation of profitability. One example: Generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, require that unrealized gains and losses on equity investments must be recognized in the calculation of net income. If a company owns a substantial stock portfolio, swings in the value of the portfolio influence net income and can distort the company\u2019s profitability.\nRelated Investing Topics\nNet income can be volatile\nNet income can be volatile\nWhile it would be nice if the net income of every stock in your portfolio rose each year without fail, that\u2019s unlikely to be the case. Net income is the result of subtracting a large number, total expenses, from another large number, total revenue. A small change in either can lead to a massive change in net income.\nAs an example, the chart below shows Amazon\u2019s (AMZN 3.12%) trailing-12-month net income since the company went public."

      "text": "What is it?\nWhat is the price-to-sales ratio?\nThe price-to-sales ratio, also known as \"price/sales,\" \"P/S ratio,\" or \"list-price-to-sale-price ratio,\" is one of many valuation metrics for stocks. The ratio describes how much someone must pay to buy one share of a company relative to how much that share generates in revenue for the company. Generally speaking, the lower the P/S ratio, the better.\nFormula\nPrice-to-sales ratio formula\nYou determine the P/S ratio by dividing the company's total market capitalization by its trailing 12-month revenue:\nThat means the P/S ratio is based solely on revenue, not on profits or cash flow. As a result, it's especially useful for comparing the valuations of companies with little or no profit or negative cash flow.\nCash Flow\nAmazon (AMZN 3.12%), for example, is notorious for having been unprofitable until 2003, seven years after it went public. On Jan. 1, 2003, Amazon's market capitalization (the sum of the price of all its outstanding shares) was $7.3 billion. Its trailing 12-month revenue was $3.9 billion. Divide $7.3 billion by $3.9 billion and you get about 1.8, which was Amazon's P/S ratio at the time.\nExample\nAn example of price-to-sales ratio analysis\nBy using the P/S ratio, we can compare Amazon's valuation on Jan. 1, 2003, with its performance leading up to that point:\nDue largely to how quickly Amazon was increasing its revenue, its price-to-sales ratio fell from a high of about 40 to 1.8. As a result, Amazon looks like a comparative bargain in 2003. (And it was: The stock has appreciated more than 22,000% since then.)\nComparing companies\nThe price-to-sales ratio can also be used for comparing companies -- including unprofitable companies -- against one another. Here, for example, is a comparison of two cloud-computing solution stocks, Snowflake (SNOW 1.07%) and Datadog (DDOG 1.6%).\nSnowflake's price-to-sales ratio is significantly higher than Datadog's. From a P/S ratio point of view, that makes Snowflake a more expensive stock. But that doesn't mean it's a worse investment. Snowflake could be worth the premium price because it's accruing revenue faster than Datadog. Remember, Amazon made a great investment in the early 2000s despite its sky-high P/S ratio because it was adding revenue at such a rapid clip.\nThe P/S ratio is a good starting point to compare two companies' stock, but investors should dive deeper to understand whether one stock is a better buy than the other.\nAdditional information\nWhat is a good price-to-sales ratio?\nIt depends on the company and the industry.\nGrocery stores, for example, have massive amounts of sales but relatively low profit margins, so it's not unusual for grocery store stocks to see P/S ratios of 0.2 or even 0.1. A higher-margin company could have a much higher P/S ratio and still be considered a bargain. Amazon's P/S ratio, for example, has ranged between 2 and 6 for the past five years.\nBecause P/S ratio is a rear-facing metric that looks only at past performance, fast-growing companies such as Snowflake or Datadog can easily see massive P/S ratios as investors bid up the price in expectation of future sales growth.\nYour best bet when looking at a company's P/S ratio is to compare it with the P/S ratios of similar companies in the same industry.\nOne piece of the puzzle\nThe price-to-sales ratio is a useful tool for evaluating companies, especially those with negative earnings or cash flow that can't be measured through the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or price-to-free-cash-flow ratio. But the P/S ratio isn't very useful on its own.\nFor example, if one company has a low P/S ratio but an unreasonably high debt load, it isn't necessarily a good value. A company's growth rate, profit margins, and competitive advantages should also be considered. Snowflake's P/S ratio might be much higher than Datadog's, but Snowflake also has no debt, is growing faster, and has a higher gross profit margin.\nInvesting decisions should never be made on the basis of a single metric, and the P/S ratio is no exception.\nRelated investing topics\nGoing beyond the P/S ratio\nCalculating the price-to-sales ratio for any given stock is very easy. Just divide the market cap by the company's total revenue. One of the best ways to use the P/S ratio is by comparing it to a stock's historical average. Alternatively, you can use it to compare the valuations of two companies' stocks to help determine which is a better fit for your portfolio. Ultimately, however, you should dig deeper for context around why the market may be trading a stock at a certain P/S ratio to make the best investment decisions possible."

      "text": "The price-to-earnings ratio, also known as the P/E ratio, is one of the most commonly used stock valuation metrics, and it is important for any investor to understand. In this article, we\u2019ll take a closer look at what the P/E ratio is, how to calculate it, and how to use it as part of your investment analysis.\nUnderstanding the P/E ratio\nUnderstanding the P/E ratio\nThe P/E ratio, or price-to-earnings ratio, is a metric that compares a company\u2019s net income to its stock price. It can be an excellent tool when analyzing stocks and can help investors get a sense of whether a stock is a good value or expensive.\nAs the name implies, the P/E ratio is calculated by taking the current share price of a stock and dividing by its earnings per share over a one-year period. For example, if a stock trades for $40 per share and earned $2 per share in the past year, its P/E ratio would be 20.\nYou may hear the P/E ratio also referred to as the P/E multiple or earnings multiple, and it\u2019s important to realize that these terms are often used interchangeably and mean the same thing.\nThere are several different ways to calculate the P/E ratio, with the two most common being the trailing P/E and the forward P/E. A stock\u2019s trailing P/E is calculated by using its past four quarters\u2019 earnings, while the forward P/E is calculated by using the consensus projections, or the company\u2019s own guidance, for the next 12 months of earnings.\nWhy is P/E ratio important?\nWhy is the P/E ratio important?\nThe P/E ratio is important because it is a valuation metric that is useful for comparing different investment opportunities to one another. It can be a useful tool when trying to identify undervalued stocks, and it can help you avoid overpaying for stocks as well.\nHow to use the P/E ratio\nHow to use the P/E ratio\nThe most effective way to use the P/E ratio is to compare the valuations of businesses in the same industry at similar stages of maturity. For example, you might use the P/E ratio as part of an analysis comparing Target (TGT 1.98%), Costco (COST -1.18%), and Walmart (WMT -1.18%).\nIt is also worth pointing out that the P/E ratio doesn\u2019t work on companies that aren\u2019t profitable. There are other valuation metrics that can be applied to early-stage growth companies, but the P/E ratio isn\u2019t one of them.\nNo valuation metric can tell you if a stock is an attractive investment opportunity all by itself, and the P/E ratio is no exception. For example, the stock of a faster-growing business should have a higher P/E ratio than a slower-growing one, all other factors being equal. So the P/E ratio is best used as one piece of the puzzle, in combination with earnings growth, cash and debt levels, gross and net profit margins, and other figures.\nFinally, if a stock has a P/E ratio that is much lower than its peers, it can be a red flag that is worthy of further investigation. Companies with P/E ratios that seem too good to be true often have declining sales, poor balance sheet quality, or another underlying reason for the seemingly cheap valuation.\nExample of using the P/E ratio\nExample of using the P/E ratio\nLet\u2019s take a look at a real-world example of calculating the P/E ratio. As of Feb. 6, 2023, Apple (AAPL 1.21%) traded for $154.50. Over the past four quarters, Apple earned $5.90 per share. So we can calculate its trailing P/E ratio as follows:\nSo Apple trades for 26.2 times its trailing-12-month earnings. If we wanted a more forward-looking metric, we can use Apple\u2019s projected earnings over the next 12 months, which are $6.23 per share. If we use this, our forward earnings calculation looks like:\nNow let\u2019s say that you\u2019re trying to decide between Apple and Microsoft (MSFT 0.56%). On the same date, Microsoft traded for $255.12. Its trailing-12-month earnings were $8.99 per share, so its trailing P/E ratio could be calculated as:\nApple\u2019s trailing P/E is 26.2, while Microsoft\u2019s is 28.4. Based on the P/E ratio alone, Apple appears to be the cheaper stock. However, as mentioned above, it\u2019s important to understand the P/E ratio is just one metric that should be used in stock analysis and doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\nSo when conducting an analysis of two companies like this, the best practice is to use the P/E ratio along with other metrics for both companies to develop a thorough comparison of the two investment opportunities."

      "text": "Competitive advantage is a term frequently used in business contexts and is typically what drives superior profits, better product sales, and the continuous ability to innovate.\nCompanies with strong competitive advantages are the best positioned to succeed within their industries and generally are able to fend off rivals more easily than others. Some of the most common factors influencing competitive advantage include cost control, product differentiation, and customer service.\nWhat is competitive advantage?\nWhat is competitive advantage?\nCompetitive advantage refers to a company's ability to produce goods and/or services more cheaply or at a higher quality than its rivals. A business may have superior customer service or may be able to produce goods at lower cost through economies of scale (a business concept that denotes the correlation between the quantity of a product a company makes and the price the company can profitably charge). A company with one or more competitive advantages is well positioned to execute its business strategy and grow sustainably relative to its peers.\nCompetitive advantage is synonymous with a company's \"unique selling proposition,\" or the distinctive reason customers are repeatedly drawn to buying a company's products or services. Perhaps you appreciate a product's low price. Maybe you like the product because it's unique in the marketplace and no other company produces anything with the same functionality. Or, perhaps, you simply value the customer service.\nThe unique selling proposition can take the form of a cost advantage -- customers in this case make repeat purchases because they are attracted to the low price. Alternately, competitive advantage can be ascertained through product differentiation. In this instance, a product's differentiated qualities entirely distinguish it from products by competitors, creating a loyal customer base.\nCompetitive advantages are important because they enable companies to consistently outperform their rivals. Companies deploy their competitive advantages to attract as many new customers as possible and increase their profit margins. By purchasing one product over another, you are implicitly affirming the seller's competitive advantage.\nCompetitive advantage vs. comparative advantage\nCompetitive advantage vs. comparative advantage\nCompetitive advantage is frequently confused with \"comparative advantage,\" which is actually just one type of competitive advantage. A company with a comparative advantage produces goods or services more efficiently than its peers. If a company requires a lower quantity of an input (for example, fuel) to produce the same output as another company, then the first company has a comparative advantage. Similarly, a comparative advantage exists if one company can transform the same quantity of inputs into a higher number of outputs than its competitors.\nPut another way, comparative advantage is a measure of relative opportunity cost, which is the value of the inputs expended, relative to a competitor, to produce a certain set of outputs. Companies with comparative advantages have opportunity costs that are lower than those of their competitors.\nExamples of competitive advantage\nExamples of competitive advantage\nAs a simple example, it's easy to see how Apple (AAPL 1.21%) enjoys several competitive advantages over other companies in the tech industry. First, Apple produces visually appealing, minimalist-inspired products that perform on a superior level relative to competitors' products. Many of the bugs commonly associated with Windows computers rarely afflict Mac devices. From this standpoint, one of Apple's most significant competitive advantages is its product quality. The company further establishes a competitive advantage by making it easy for customers to integrate Apple devices across the company's various product lines.\nThe Apple customer experience is also meant to create competitive advantage. Certainly, the way in which Apple sells its products, both online and in stores, is favorable for both buyers and seller. Purchases are completed seamlessly through computers, smartphones, and watches, and most of the in-store paperwork, if you do visit a store, is completed via tablet. Apple makes it extremely easy to be a customer, which creates significant brand loyalty. This devotion to Apple explains how the company is able to make the same phone repeatedly and still grow its revenues!\nAnother example is Slack (NYSE:WORK), one of the tech sector's newest darlings, which allows its users to replace email with real-time communication and file sharing. The application is also enjoyable to use -- the exact opposite of email -- and excels as a central hub for companies' employees and contractors. Slack's competitive advantages are both the uniqueness of its product and the growing power of its brand. For this example, it's how fundamentally different Slack is that garners the company a competitive advantage.\nTypes of competitive advantages and strategies\nTypes of competitive advantages and strategies\nCompanies strive to create competitive advantages to differentiate themselves from rivals. A company may choose to hire only those with a very specific skillset to make the company's most important decisions. Harnessing this specialized knowledge and skill base can by itself create a competitive advantage and also shrinks the talent pool available to competitors. People with superior skills can be deployed to create superior products, which, in turn, can attract more customers. Companies must continuously seek new ways to develop competitive advantages in order to find new buyers and increase customer retention.\nAs mentioned above, competitive advantages can be established based on product differentiation, product quality, or product cost. Competitive advantage can also be achieved by offering outstanding customer experiences. Strong marketing and branding, in addition, can increase competitive advantage by establishing and reinforcing customer loyalty.\nA differential competitive advantage is considered the holy grail of competitive advantages. A company with differential competitive advantage offers products that are both unique and superior in quality. A company with a differential competitive advantage holds a strong competitive position via multiple elements of its business, thus creating a wide gap between the company and its industry peers.\nBusinesses that seek to maintain a sustainable competitive advantage are aiming to become entrenched atop their respective industries for years or decades; they are not trying to simply achieve the best results for a single quarter. Sustainable competitive advantage requires continuous improvement throughout the organization, ongoing product improvement, and new concept ideation. Companies with phenomenal product quality wishing to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage don't just create one winning product; they continue to iterate and expand their offerings to increasingly capture market share over time.\nRelated investing topics\nApplying competitive advantage to investing\nApplying competitive advantage to investing\nAt least a basic understanding of competitive advantage is necessary for any industry analysis investors conduct to determine what a company is worth. Searching for companies with clear competitive advantages within their respective industries can help you to decide how to invest, particularly when creating a portfolio of long-term stock holdings.\nIt's also important to be able to recognize competitive advantage when you see it. A company's competitive advantage is the reason you buy from certain businesses and why you are likely to continue doing so in the future. As time passes and business landscapes continually evolve, new sources of competitive advantage will continue to emerge in all sectors of the economy."

      "text": "Net operating income is an important financial term -- one often misunderstood. There are many different sorts of income (also known as profits) on any company's income statement, and they all serve different purposes in your financial analysis. So let's get specific and dig into the details of net operating income, or NOI.\nBreaking down net operating income\nBreaking down net operating income\nIn a nutshell, net operating income is a company's direct profit from its core operations. Boosting this metric is all about running your chosen business more efficiently, generating stronger revenues while keeping a tight grip on your day-to-day expenses.\nYou start the NOI calculation from gross profits (revenues minus cost of revenues) and then subtract the direct operating costs involved in earning that revenue.\nI'm talking about selling, general, and administrative expenses; sales and marketing costs; and research and development budgets. It also accounts for industry-specific operating costs, such as shipping expenses for e-commerce retailers or fuel costs for shipping services.\nHowever, the analysis stops before reaching financial management items like taxes, interest expenses, depreciation, and amortization. Unless you're running a bank, those items are not part of your core business.\nNet operating income isn't exactly the same thing as earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). That metric takes a couple of extra steps down the income statement. EBIT accounts for depreciation and amortization costs, while NOI doesn't.\nNOI is even more similar to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Here, the difference is EBITDA is a commonly used metric with clearly defined components, while net operating income is open to adjustments as different companies may include different items in their core operations.\nHence, net operating income gives you a cleaner view of the company's business operations without applying the long-term costs of infrastructure, capital equipment, rental fees, and other business-related property expenses.\nA high net operating income typically signals an efficient operation wherein the costs are well-controlled, while a low one may suggest rising expenses are chipping away at profits. Companies in the middle of an ambitious cost-cutting program should see stronger NOI results as the new strategy takes effect.\nWhy it matters\nWhy net operating income matters\nNet operating income isn't just another line on a financial statement. It's an essential measure of a company's operational profitability and efficiency, going straight to the heart of actual business quality.\nThe company's fiscal management strategy is also important, of course, but NOI isn't the tool you need for that purpose. Yardsticks and measuring cups serve very different purposes, but both are helpful measuring tools. Likewise, net operating income highlights a different part of the financial puzzle from other metrics, such as EBIT and free cash flows.\nNet operating income helps us understand how well a company's management is controlling operational costs and how sustainable its business model is without the fiscal noise of tax, interest expenses, and long-term write-downs of capital expenses.\nHow to use it\nHow you can use net operating income\nCan the company you're looking at control its operating expenses effectively? How efficient is its revenue generation? These are questions net operating income can help answer.\nYou can track how the company's NOI has changed over time, looking for companies with stable or improving operating efficiency. You could also compare and contrast net operating income results between companies in similar situations, showing how effectively a number of head-to-head competitors manage their businesses facing comparable markets and challenges.\nDespite its clear utility for these handy purposes, NOI is not as commonly used as EBIT, net income, and cash-flow figures. Few companies report it, so you'll need to do your own calculations in most cases. On the upside, the insights you gain from this uncommon analysis could give you a leg up on the investor community at large.\nViewing UPS through the NOI lens\nViewing UPS through the NOI lens\nLet's look at shipping service giants FedEx (FDX 5.11%) and UPS (UPS 2.98%) with the help of net operating income. Here's how UPS presented its operating costs for the full fiscal years of 2022 and 2021:\n| UPS | 2022 | 2021 | YOY Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Revenue | $100,338 | $97,287 | 3.1% |\n| Compensation and benefits* | $47,781 | $46,707 | 2.3% |\n| Repairs and maintenance | $2,515 | $2,443 | 2.9% |\n| Depreciation and amortization | $3,188 | $2,953 | 8.0% |\n| Purchased transportation* | $17,653 | $19,058 | -7.4% |\n| Fuel* | $6,018 | $3,847 | 56.4% |\n| Other occupancy* | $1,818 | $1,698 | 7.1% |\n| Other expenses | $8,271 | $7,771 | 6.4% |\n| NOI (only operating costs highlighted with asterisks) | $40,836 | $41,337 | -1.2% |\n| Costs excluded from NOI | $13,974 | $13,167 | 6.1% |\n| EBIT (includes all operating costs) | $13,094 | $12,810 | 2.2% |\nCasting an NOI light on FedEx\nCasting an NOI light on FedEx\nAs you can see, fuel costs skyrocketed in 2022, while other operating costs trended higher due to global inflation. UPS managed to increase its EBIT, but NOI profits fell by 1.2%. In other words, it looks like UPS failed to run a more profitable shipping business in 2022. Instead, the company boosted its operating profits in 2022 by holding back on capital expenses and other accounting tricks.\nWell, 2022 was a difficult year with runaway global inflation and other economic challenges. So how did FedEx tackle the same environment?\n| FedEx | 2022 | 2021 | YOY Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Revenue | $45,814 | $42,078 | 8.9% |\n| Salaries* | $16,435 | $16,217 | 1.3% |\n| Purchased transportation* | $6,322 | $5,744 | 10.1% |\n| Rentals and landing fees* | $2,568 | $2,296 | 11.8% |\n| Depreciation and amortization | $2,007 | $1,946 | 3.1% |\n| Fuel* | $4,418 | $2,461 | 79.5% |\n| Maintenance and repairs | $2,120 | $2,228 | -4.8% |\n| Business realignment costs | $278 | $116 | 139.7% |\n| Intercompany charges | $1,997 | $1,996 | 0.1% |\n| Other | $6,747 | $6,264 | 7.7% |\n| NOI (only operating costs highlighted with asterisks) | $16,071 | $15,360 | 4.6% |\n| Costs excluded from NOI | $13,149 | $12,550 | 4.8% |\n| EBIT (includes all operating costs) | $2,922 | $2,810 | 4.0% |\nFedEx increased its net operating income year over year, actually outperforming its EBIT gains. Mainly, the company canceled out the higher fuel costs and airport charges by issuing lower salary increases to its staff than UPS did to theirs.\nHere, the NOI tool helped us highlight how UPS and FedEx approached the challenges of 2022 in different ways. FedEx found ways to increase its net operating income, even in a tight economy with inflation-boosted costs. Its reliance on limited pay increases could lead to lower NOI in the long run if the slow salary increases result in unmotivated workers.\nSo FedEx investors should keep an eye on the long-term NOI development. But so far, so good -- FedEx outperformed UPS on the net operating income line in 2022."

  "argos_summary": "Shopify\u2019s stock surged 22% after its Q2 2025 earnings, driven by strong growth in gross merchandise volume (up 27% YoY) and revenue (up 29% YoY). The company\u2019s no\u2011code, AI\u2011enhanced ecosystem has helped it regain profitability after abandoning its costly fulfillment network, but its valuation remains high with a P/E of ~70 and a P/S of 18. While the stock is still only about 20% below its all\u2011time high, investors should approach it cautiously, balancing the upside from continued growth against the risk of a near\u2011term pullback. The Motley Fool\u2019s analyst team does not currently rank Shopify among its top 10 picks, suggesting a more selective stance for investors.\n",
