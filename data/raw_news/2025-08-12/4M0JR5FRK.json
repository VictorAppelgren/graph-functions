  "description": "The breakup between \u201cLove Island\u201d stars JaNa Craig and Kenny Rodriguez has sparked conversation about phone snooping. You can sleuth instead.",
  "content": "Put yourself in Emma\u2019s shoes: You\u2019re scrolling on your phone and get a text notification that says, \u201cHey girly, your boyfriend said you guys would have a threesome with me, and I think he didn\u2019t tell you about that.\u201d\n\nWould you (a) ignore the message or (b) look through his conveniently unattended phone?\n\nIf you chose (b), don\u2019t feel too bad. Nearly 30% of American adults say it\u2019s at least sometimes acceptable to look through a significant other\u2019s phone without permission, according to a Pew Research Center survey.\n\n\u201cI have looked through many of my partners\u2019 phones, and I definitely have quite a few stories,\u201d said Emma, who didn\u2019t want to include her last name to protect her privacy.\n\nAn age-old debate surrounding phone snooping has been revived by the July breakup between JaNa Craig and Kenny Rodriguez, stars of the 2024 season of the reality dating show \u201cLove Island USA.\u201d\n\n\u201cDiscovering that someone you loved isn\u2019t who you thought they were and that the relationship you thought you were building hasn\u2019t been genuine since day one has been truly devastating,\u201d Craig wrote in an Instagram story post confirming the split. Craig\u2019s friend then took to Instagram to advise other women in relationships to \u201cgo thru your mans phone TODAY\u201d if they had access. (Craig and Rodriguez haven\u2019t confirmed the more specific details of their breakup.)\n\nSearching through someone\u2019s phone may not be aligned with a person\u2019s character and values, but they might have valid suspicions and no other way find the truth \u2014 so they look.\n\nDoing so may turn out to be fair game when you learn incriminating information, according to divorce lawyer Dennis R. Vetrano, who is also a mediator and content creator based in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley.\n\nNot so much to this psychologist.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think that invading another person\u2019s private space \u2014 whether it\u2019s snooping on their phone, reading their personal journal, or invading their physical space \u2014 is unethical without their permission,\u201d said Dr. Cortney Warren, board certified clinical psychologist and adjunct clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\n\nSnooping also can be illegal, depending on privacy laws in your state or other jurisdiction, so it\u2019s not advised that you go through your partner\u2019s phone, according to Vetrano.\n\nBut is such snooping even necessary anymore? With so much out in the public sphere online, do you really need to snoop? Why not replace snooping with sleuthing?\n\nDo you need to look through a partner\u2019s phone?\n\nThe easy answer is no.\n\nWhile snooping is considered a breach of privacy because you\u2019re searching for information someone hasn\u2019t given you permission to access, with sleuthing you\u2019re working with information that\u2019s available in an online public space.\n\nAnd so many people are online: Seventy percent of American adults are on Facebook, 50% on Instagram, and 33% on TikTok, according to a 2024 survey.\n\nSleuthing is easier these days with the creation of websites that can locate dating profiles, apps that track location, and most notably, social media platforms that allow you to see everyone who a person follows and the content they like. It\u2019s all there for anyone to mine.\n\nThat was the case with Emma.\n\n\u201cI had already been kind of suspicious of this boyfriend for a while,\u201d Emma said. \u201cSo I was sleuthing through (his) TikTok following, and it was just girl after girl after girl of those OnlyFans models and anime cosplayers that, you know, cosplay minor characters in very inappropriate ways.\u201d\n\nIs sleuthing OK to do?\n\n\u201cTechnology is out there to track everything that you do, so I think the question \u2014 is it the right thing to do \u2014 is really something that we have to center on,\u201d said Dr. Angela Corbo, a professor and chair of the department of communication studies at Widener University in Chester, Pennsylvania.\n\nAs far as Emma was concerned, going through her previous partners\u2019 social media followings was justified because she was accessing public information and she ended up finding evidence of behavior she didn\u2019t like.\n\n\u201cI had been very straight up with my partners, and I don\u2019t like (them) following OnlyFans models because honestly, it was kind of embarrassing when everybody can see that your partner is liking photos and sharing weird adult content videos publicly,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen it comes to social media, people can formulate an image of what another person is like based on who they follow and the content with which they interact.\n\n\u201cI think social media is a great way of getting an idea without waiting for someone to show you, or without having to break someone\u2019s boundaries and invade their privacy,\u201d said Diana Prime, a relationship coach on Instagram and TikTok. \u201cIf someone has adult-rated content, if they\u2019re following OnlyFans models, that is enough to not continue a relationship with that person because it gives you an insight to what they do.\u201d\n\nIs snooping through someone\u2019s phone still wrong?\n\nSnooping is also a sign of other troubles, such as not respecting your partner, Prime said. In that case, you\u2019re \u201cnot going to think twice about invading their privacy.\u201d\n\nGenerally, sleuthing \u201cis different in the sense that the material online is often public \u2014 so the deceptive element of violating a partner\u2019s personal boundaries is less pronounced,\u201d said Warren, author of \u201cLetting Go of Your Ex: CBT Skills to Heal the Pain of a Breakup and Overcome Love Addiction.\u201d\n\nThink of it like this: Say you\u2019re sitting beside a partner and happen to glimpse a notification on their phone. \u201cYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong,\u201d Corbo said. \u201cI think it\u2019s when you go behind somebody\u2019s back to retrieve information that they\u2019re not giving you permission for \u2014 I think that\u2019s when a violation has occurred.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re already in breakup territory if you\u2019re feeling like your partner\u2019s behavior leaves you no other option but to snoop. \u201cThat\u2019s a deeper-rooted problem that will lead to bigger issues down the road, and that\u2019s enough to walk away from someone, because what happens when you find information by snooping is that you hurt your own feelings times 10,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt will do you more damage to snoop through that person\u2019s phone than to honor your own intuition about something being off,\u201d Prime added. \u201cWhat within you wants to play things out, versus just trusting yourself the first time?\u201d\n\nIf your ex-partners have treated you badly and you\u2019re regularly suspicious of a partner who hasn\u2019t given you a reason to be, Corbo suggested evaluating your feelings and considering the evidence before you assume the worst.\n\nGet inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

      "text": "When someone scrolls through Val\u2019s Instagram page, they can see a recent camping trip she took with friends, a batch of homemade chicken nuggets and a few of her favorite memes.\nBut what they can\u2019t see: Val, 22, got engaged nine months ago to her boyfriend of two years.\nShe never made a post about the proposal \u2014 and she doesn\u2019t plan to.\n\u201cWe are happy and content as we are, living our lives together privately \u2026 no outsiders peering in through the windows, so to speak,\u201d said Val, who lives with her fianc\u00e9 in San Marcos, Texas, and asked CNN not to use her last name for privacy reasons.\nVal is one of a growing number of young adults from Generation Z, the cohort from age 28 down to teenagers, who are opting for \u201cquiet relationships,\u201d in which their love lives \u2014 the good and the bad \u2014remain offline and out of view from a larger audience of friends and family.\nIt\u2019s a new turn back to the old way of doing things: date nights without selfies, small weddings without public photo galleries and conflict without a procession of passive-aggressive posts. On platforms such as TikTok, creators declaring this preference for \u201cquiet\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d relationships rake in thousands of views, and on Pinterest, searches for \u201ccity hall elopement\u201d surged over 190% from 2023 to 2024.\nIf your prefrontal cortex developed before the iPhone came along, you may be rolling your eyes. But for a generation raised on social media, rejecting the pressure to post is a novel development \u2014 and one that experts say could redefine the future of intimacy.\nHow social media killed romance\nGen Z\u2019s turn toward privacy partly stems from a growing discomfort with how social media shapes \u2014 and distorts \u2014 romantic relationships, said Rae Weiss, a Gen Z dating coach studying for her master\u2019s degree in psychology at Columbia University in New York City.\nA couple that appears to be #relationshipgoals may flaunt their luxury vacations together, picture-perfect date nights, matching outfits and grand romantic gestures. But Gen Z has been online long enough to know it\u2019s all just a carefully curated ruse.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer a secret that on social media, you\u2019re only posting the best moments of your life, the best angles, the best pictures, the filters,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cYoung people are becoming more aware that it can create some level of dissonance and insecurity when your relationship doesn\u2019t look like that all the time.\u201d\nIndeed, there are messy, complicated and outright mundane moments to every relationship \u2014 but those aren\u2019t algorithmically climbing the ranks (unless the tea is piping hot, of course). This can lead some to equate the value of their relationships with how \u201cInstagrammable\u201d they are, Weiss said.\nFrequently broadcasting your relationship on social media has even been linked to lower levels of overall satisfaction and an anxious attachment style between partners, according to a 2023 study.\nEmbracing private relationships, then, is partly Gen Z\u2019s way of rejecting the suffocating pressures of perfection and returning to the value of real-life displays of affection.\n\u201cThere\u2019s less incentive to \u2018keep up\u2019 with others\u2019 posts,\u201d said Dr. Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center and professor emerita of media psychology at Fielding Graduate University in Santa Barbara, California. \u201cThis can protect against relationship envy or distorted expectations, comparing the relationship to others\u2019 public presentations.\u201d\nWhile Val said she has certainly felt the pressure to show off her love life in the past, she ultimately thinks a digital shrine to her fianc\u00e9 would feel too false.\n\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m trying to prove something, to prove that we love each other, when the proof is all around us: our cats, our home and life that we\u2019ve built together,\u201d Val said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to see me posting about him to know that I love him.\u201d\nWhat others don\u2019t see, they can\u2019t ruin\nJason, 21, who has been seeing his current girlfriend for nearly a year but isn\u2019t posting any photos of the two of them together, admits the main reason he\u2019s not oversharing is to avoid putting his relationship through the same scrutiny his friends apply to other couples.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the thought of being perceived and talked about,\u201d said Jason, a student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who asked CNN to only use his first name for privacy reasons. \u201cI\u2019ve even stopped talking to a lot of my friends about (relationships) because I found that they\u2019ll start to see your partner differently.\u201d\nFor Jason, his reluctance to share about his love life is not so much a fear of being publicly shamed or bullied, but the imagined group chat discussions, private direct messages and Instagram investigations he may be subjected to.\nSocial anxiety is nothing new, but for a generation raised online, a new form of it has become endemic to our way of relating to one another, said Brooke Duffy, an associate professor of communication at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. \u201cImagined surveillance,\u201d as she calls it, is the feeling that your every move is being watched and scrutinized by an ambiguous audience, and she said it\u2019s a product of how social media has normalized voyeurism.\n\u201cTo broadcast your relationship means to open it up to a public audience and have people trawl through images and dissect the communication,\u201d Duffy said of her research. \u201cOf course, influencers are under a high-powered microscope, but we found this was an organizing principle for how young people create content online.\u201d\nThe fear is that others aren\u2019t just looking at your relationship \u2014 they are staring at it, digging into it, and passing moral judgments on you and your partner. All of that noise, real or imagined, can cloud your own appraisal of the person you\u2019re with, especially early on in a relationship, said 26-year-old Jillian St. Onge.\n\u201cI refrained from sharing my relationship with my followers for a while, and also from my family truthfully,\u201d said St. Onge, who lives in New York and is now engaged to her partner. \u201cHeartbreak is hard enough on its own, so when everybody knows everything too early, you feel like you owe others, even random people, an explanation as to what went awry. \u2026 Being intentionally private allowed me to form opinions for myself and really focus on building a deep connection.\u201d\nThe days of posting moody, vague jabs at your partner during a period of conflict are over, St. Onge said. While it can feel vindicating to rally an audience around your perspective, the move is shortsighted and often stokes more drama than it\u2019s worth, she said.\nBut despite being highly aware of their own surveillance, members of Gen Z still manage to invent new ways of indulging the desire to share. \u201cSoft-launching,\u201d for example, is one way someone can share the fact that they are in a relationship without giving away the identity of their partner, Duffy said.\nPinterest is flooded with soft-launch ideas: two plates on the dinner table, two silhouettes cast against a blank wall, two pairs of shoes sitting next to one another.\nFor St. Onge, who regularly posts videos of her day-to-day life, a soft launch on her socials after about five months of dating her now-fianc\u00e9 was exactly the level of privacy she needed.\nJason also makes a distinction between what goes on the \u201cgrid,\u201d where photos are permanent until deleted, and on the \u201cstory,\u201d where posts disappear within 24 hours.\n\u201cA story doesn\u2019t have to have the same communicative impact as something that\u2019s on your grid,\u201d Duffy explained. \u201cIt captures a fleeting moment, and I think because of that, people are more willing to step outside the boundaries of their personal profile or brand.\u201d\n\u2018Private but not secret\u2019 \u2014 how do you tell the difference?\nFrom an outsider\u2019s perspective, privacy and secrecy can look the same, said Lia Huynh, a licensed marriage and family therapist based in San Jose, California.\n\u201cHowever, the motive is different,\u201d Huynh said in an email. \u201cPrivacy aims to protect, to be cautious and careful. Someone who wants privacy doesn\u2019t want the relationship to be hidden, but feels it is necessary to protect the relationship.\u201d\nSecrecy, on the other hand, comes at the expense of the other person, and often has a more selfish motive such as feelings of shame or embarrassment, Huynh said.\nSo how can couples tell the difference? First, Huynh recommends private partners identify their own motives.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for the person who wants privacy to make sure they communicate that they are not ashamed of their partner, nor are they doing it to keep their options open,\u201d Huynh said. \u201cMake sure you both agree on what this looks like.\u201d\nWeiss said communication can be tricky when dealing with a mismatch of expectations, in which one partner values the input of their wider social circle more than the other does.\nIt\u2019s also important to have at least one or two people outside the relationship you feel comfortable talking to when you just need to vent or if the conflict becomes too difficult to manage on your own, Weiss said.\n\u201cI always say listen to your gut. \u2026 It comes down to identifying values. Whatever the relationship struggle you\u2019re experiencing is, ask how (you can) come up with solutions in a way that aligns with your values,\u201d Weiss said.\nOverall, to Rutledge, who has studied social media since its inception, the \u201cquiet relationship\u201d is a wholly positive turn for how young people conduct their personal lives.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen more young people opting for digital detoxes, living in the moment,\u201d Rutledge said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary, but it can be very revealing. Anything that encourages people to be more (intentional) with their use of social media, rather than passive, is a good sign.\u201d\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

      "text": "Many Americans use social media to connect with one another, engage with news content, share information and entertain themselves. Explore the patterns and trends shaping the social media landscape.\nTo better understand Americans\u2019 social media use, Pew Research Center surveyed 5,626 U.S. adults from Feb. 1 to June 10, 2024. SSRS conducted this National Public Opinion Reference Survey (NPORS) for the Center using address-based sampling and a multimode protocol that included web, mail and phone. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection.

      "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Adulthood, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has tips to help you make more informed decisions around personal finance, career, wellness and personal connections.\nYou and your crush have been dating for a few months now, and you\u2019ve agreed to take the next step by committing to a long-term relationship \u2013 then you hear something that catches you off guard.\nThey want to quit their job in a year and live off the grid, while you have planned on working in the city and staying close to your family. How did you miss this crucial information? And what now?\n\u201cWhen people first fall in love, where they first feel infatuation, sometimes logic goes out the window,\u201d said Deborah Carr, a professor of sociology and director of the Center for Innovation in Social Science at Boston University. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of data showing that logical thought patterns sometimes get lost in the fray when someone really is very attracted to a person or they\u2019re feeling the throes of passion.\u201d\nDepending how far into a relationship people are, not having assessed certain areas of compatibility early on can have difficult emotional and practical consequences, said Jeremy Nicholson, a Massachusetts-based social psychologist and contributor for Psychology Today.\nIf you discover you and your partner are incompatible, \u201cyou\u2019re either in a relationship with somebody you love but makes you miserable because you can\u2019t have a healthy relationship with them, or you break up with somebody that you\u2019re deeply in love with,\u201d Nicholson said. Even though having conversations about priorities early on seems difficult, in the long run, it\u2019s actually much easier on your emotions, he added.\nAdditionally, as commitment increases, the practical aspects of partners\u2019 lives often get more intertwined \u2013 \u201cparticularly financially,\u201d Nicholson added. \u201cSo it becomes a bigger problem for you if you haven\u2019t had these conversations and then they\u2019re spending the rent money, and you both might be homeless.\u201d\nThe dissolution of a relationship \u201calso can be expensive, like when you have to divorce. Cohabitating and then finding a new apartment is very disruptive,\u201d Carr said. Sometimes \u201cit really can create difficulties for people and their family and friends when a serious relationship dissolves. So, I think it\u2019s important to jump in cautiously and have as much information as possible.\u201d\nBy the time you\u2019re considering committing to a serious relationship with someone (or multiple someones), you probably already know their Covid-19 vaccination status, political affiliation or religious beliefs. Here are questions you should ask yourself and your love interests to assess red flags and overall compatibility each step of the way.\nCommitting long term\nWhen you\u2019re considering commitment, ask yourself why you\u2019re with this person, what benefits you\u2019re gaining and what about them makes you happy, Carr said. \u201cSometimes the answer is, \u2018Well I\u2019m lonely, and I need someone.\u2019 (But) that\u2019s not really sufficient grounds for throwing oneself into a relationship,\u201d she added.\n\u201cCouples I work with \u2013 who are new and just getting to know one another \u2013 don\u2019t often attend as well as they should to their emotional compatibility, the degree to which they\u2019re really comfortable with one another, or whether they\u2019re just infatuated and attracted to one another,\u201d said John Duffy, a psychologist specializing in work with teens, parents, couples and families.\nEmotional compatibility is feeling like you can share anything with your partner, versus feeling guarded and as if you have to put on a facade, Duffy added.\n\u201cWillingness to commit is fairly easy,\u201d Nicholson said, but does your partner want to commit to a short-term or long-term relationship? And what do they even mean by a long-term relationship?\nFor some people, that looks like having a partnership, getting married or raising children. Is that relationship monogamous, open or polyamorous? Do you \u2013 and do they \u2013 like the idea of living together one day?\nCompatibility\nIn addition to knowing the type of relationship you want, it\u2019s important to know how well you align from a practical standpoint on other values, finances and sexual activity.\nWatch for value- or character-based red flags early on, such as a lack of financial generosity \u2013 evidenced by behaviors including not appropriately tipping waitstaff \u2013 excessive spending or extreme restriction. Paying attention to early signs of financial compatibility will pay off if you decide to cohabitate, Duffy said.\n\u201cIt also shows up in other areas of relationships over time,\u201d such as how generous they are with their time and attention, including when it comes to your physical needs and desires, he added.\nSome people have lifestyles or medical conditions that might influence what they need from a partner. Does the person you\u2019re planning to commit to have a substance misuse issue or sobriety journey for which they\u2019ll need support? Or will you, and have you communicated that?\nHow does your partner treat family members, people of different genders and people with whom they have strained relationships? Have they revealed signs of violent or aggressive behavior, such as road rage or snapping over an insignificant event? Do they argue using healthy and open communication, or does it feel cold and abusive?\n\u201cPart of the growth is disagreeing in a healthy way and learning and growing from that \u2013 growing together, even, from disagreements and finding your way back to making up with one another,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cThat\u2019s a really important issue to look at when you\u2019re gauging the potential longevity of a relationship.\u201d\nDetermining sexual compatibility includes asking what types of physical intimacy are and aren\u2019t OK. \u201cThat can be everything from toys to oral sex to all kinds of foreplay \u2026 then we get into fetishes and fantasies and things like that,\u201d Nicholson said. \u201cIf somebody needs a particular thing and the other person can\u2019t stand it, then that\u2019s kind of a red flag that either needs to be worked through or the relationship might not be able to progress.\u201d\nRegarding sex, the main questions are what types of activities both partners enjoy, and how often each person wants it, Nicholson said. People also differ in their beliefs about whether having one\u2019s sexual needs met is solely their partner\u2019s responsibility. Also, what\u2019s your partner\u2019s sleep routine like, if they have one at all?\n\u201cThe bigger the disparity there, the more they\u2019re going to have things to work out,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in people\u2019s best interest to discuss sexually transmitted infections as soon as they become sexually active,\u201d Carr added. Couples should discuss sexual health, including birth control and who will be responsible for it and any presumptions about that.\nIf your loved ones aren\u2019t supportive of your partner, will you protect your relationship and set boundaries? What is your partner\u2019s relationship like with their own family?\nThese days with dating apps, you might know something about a person\u2019s life goals \u2013 such as whether they want children \u2013 early on. If not, for adults, between three and six months of being together is when having discussions about children is worthwhile, Duffy said.\nCohabitating\nSharing a home with a partner can bring up additional considerations in each important area of compatibility.\nWhen it comes to finances, assess a partner\u2019s ability to be conscientious and follow through, Nicholson said. How do they plan to pay off high debts? Do they have a savings account?\nDetermine whether \u201cthey\u2019re living an immediate, impulsive lifestyle, or whether they\u2019re able to delay gratification, save and basically plan for the future,\u201d Nicholson added. Also consider who\u2019s going to pay for what and why, whether contributions depend on each person\u2019s salary, and if you want to maintain separate or joint accounts.\nExpectations about household chores can become contentious if not discussed sooner rather than later. Sometimes people make assumptions based on their cultural background or beliefs about gender roles, Nicholson said. Partners should get a sense of each other\u2019s existing beliefs, then discuss what they\u2019re comfortable with moving forward. Carr said she typically recommends each person does what they enjoy.\nAsking questions about long-term career goals is also critical, Carr added. If your partner foresees a major shift such as moving for a new job, are you expected to move with them? Which person gets to have the shorter commute and why?\nBefore saying \u2018I do\u2019\nMany of the same compatibility assessments done for cohabitation also apply to marriage, but in the latter case, the expectations become more serious, Carr and Nicholson said.\nYou might be able to be somewhat flexible with someone\u2019s spending habits while living together, but if they\u2019re accruing debt and you\u2019re going to marry them, their debts will become yours, too, Nicholson said. As your life becomes increasingly tied to theirs, you must be sure you\u2019re comfortable with who they are and what they do, because you\u2019ll be affected more than before.\nAlso, \u201cit\u2019s very difficult to change people,\u201d Carr said. \u201cAs people age, they become an amplified version of their younger selves. So if there\u2019s a trait in your partner that agitates you when you\u2019re 25, that trait will get larger and might be far, far more annoying when one is 50 \u2013 so really ask yourself about the good, the bad and the ugly and what you\u2019re willing to accept and not accept in a relationship.\u201d"

      "text": "How we did this\nPew Research Center has long studied the changing nature of romantic relationships as well as the role of digital technology in people\u2019s lives. This particular report focuses on the patterns, experiences and attitudes related to digital technology use in romantic relationships. These findings are based on a survey conducted Oct. 16 to 28, 2019, among 4,860 U.S. adults. This includes those who took part as members of Pew Research Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses, as well as respondents from the Ipsos KnowledgePanel who indicated that they identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual (LGB). The margin of sampling error for the full sample is plus or minus 2.1 percentage points.\nRecruiting ATP panelists by phone or mail ensures that nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. This gives us confidence that any sample can represent the whole U.S. adult population (see our Methods 101 explainer on random sampling). To further ensure that each ATP survey reflects a balanced cross-section of the nation, the data is weighted to match the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories.\nFor more, see the report\u2019s Methodology. You can also find the questions asked, and the answers the public provided in the topline.\nAmid growing debates about the impact of smartphones and social media on romantic relationships, a Pew Research Center survey conducted in October 2019 finds that many Americans encounter some tech-related struggles with their significant others.\nFor instance, among partnered adults in the U.S. \u2013 that is, those who are married, cohabiting or in a committed relationship, roughly half (51%) say their partner is often or sometimes distracted by their cellphone while they are trying to have a conversation with them, and four-in-ten say they are at least sometimes bothered by the amount of time their partner spends on their mobile device.\nPartnered adults under the age of 50 are particularly likely to express the feeling that their partner is distracted by their phone, with those ages 30 to 49 most likely to report this. Fully 62% of 30- to 49-year-olds and 52% of 18-to 29-year-olds who are in a romantic relationship say their partner is at least sometimes distracted by their phone when they\u2019re trying to talk them. Still, this issue is not confined to younger age groups: 41% of partnered Americans ages 50 and older say they have encountered this in their relationship at least sometimes.\nWith phones being such a distraction, people might be tempted to look through their partner\u2019s phone. However, there is widespread agreement among the public that digital snooping in couples is unacceptable. Seven-in-ten Americans \u2013 regardless of whether they are in a relationship \u2013 say it is rarely or never acceptable for someone to look through their partner\u2019s cellphone without that person\u2019s knowledge. Still, 34% of partnered adults say they have looked through their partner\u2019s cellphone without that person\u2019s knowledge, with women being more likely than men to say they have done this (42% vs. 25%).\nFor many adults, social media plays a role in the way they navigate and share information about their romantic relationships. Roughly eight-in-ten social media users (81%) report that they at least sometimes see others posting about their relationships, including 46% who say this happens often, but few say that seeing these posts affects how they feel about their own love life.\nMoreover, social media has become a place where some users discuss relationships and investigate old ones. Roughly half of social media users (53%) say they have used these platforms to check up on someone they used to date or be in a relationship with, while 28% say they have used social media to share or discuss things about their relationship or dating life. For adult users under the age of 30, those shares who have used social media to checked-up on a former partner (70%) or posted about their own love life (48%) are even higher.\nBut social media can also be a source of annoyance and conflict for some couples. Among those whose partner uses social media, 23% say they have felt jealous or unsure of their relationship because of the way their current partner interacts with others on these sites, and this share rises to 34% among those ages 18 to 29.\nStill, some users view these platforms as an important venue for showing love and affection. This is especially true for younger users who are partnered: 48% of 18- to 29-year-old social media users say social media is very or somewhat important for them in showing how much they care about their partner.\nThese are some of the main findings from a nationally representative survey of 4,860 U.S. adults conducted online Oct. 16 to 28, 2019, using Pew Research Center\u2019s American Trend Panel.\nTerminology\nSeveral terms are used in this report to describe people\u2019s current relationship status. This reference guide explains each term. Single is used to describe people who are not currently in a committed relationship but may be casually dating (31% of the sample). Single and looking refers to people who are not in a committed relationship (but may be casually dating) and are looking for dates or a relationship (15% of the sample). Casually dating refers to single people who are casually dating someone but are not in a committed relationship (4% of the sample). Partnered refers to adults who are married, cohabiting or in a committed relationship (69% of the sample). Cohabiting is used to describe people who currently live with their partner but are not married (11% of the sample). Committed relationship is used to describe people who are in a relationship but are not married or cohabiting (8% of the sample). Unmarried is used to refer to any adults who are not currently married \u2013 single, cohabiting or in a committed relationship (50% of the sample). This term is sometimes used in conjunction with the term \u201cpartnered\u201d to refer to those who are cohabiting or in a committed relationship (for example, unmarried partnered adults constitute 19% of the sample).\n40% of partnered adults say they are bothered by the amount of time their partner spends on their cellphone\nAt the time of the survey, four-in-ten Americans who are married, living with a partner or who are in a committed relationship say they are often or sometimes bothered by the amount of time their partner spends on their cellphone, including 12% who say they feel this way often.1\nIn addition, 24% of partnered Americans report that they are at least sometimes bothered by the amount of time their partner spends on social media, while a somewhat smaller share (15%) say they feel this way about their partner playing video games.\nThere are certain groups who are more likely to express annoyance over their partner\u2019s digital activities than others. Among partnered adults, women are more likely than men to say they are often bothered by the amount of time their partner spends on their cellphone (16% vs. 8%) or playing video games (7% vs. 3%).2\nBeyond gender differences, people\u2019s attitudes also vary by age. Some 18% of partnered adults ages 18 to 49 say they are often bothered by the amount of time their partner spends on their phone, compared with 6% of those ages 50 and older. Younger adults in romantic relationships also are more likely than their older counterparts to say they are often bothered by the amount of time their partner spends on social media (11% vs. 4%) and playing video games (7% vs. 3%).\nRoughly half of partnered people say their significant other is distracted by their phone at least sometimes when they try to talk to them\nWhile relatively few Americans are familiar with the term \u201cphubbing\u201d \u2013 which is the practice of snubbing others in favor of their cellphones \u2013 notable shares say they have encountered that behavior in their romantic relationships.\nWhen asked to reflect on their partner\u2019s cellphone use, 51% of Americans in a romantic relationship say their partner is at least sometimes distracted by their cellphone when they are trying to have a conversation with them, including 16% who say their significant other is often distracted by their mobile device.\nThis pattern differs by age: Roughly six-in-ten partnered adults ages 30 to 49 say their significant other is at least sometimes distracted by their cellphone when they are trying to hold a conversation with them, compared with 52% of those ages 18 to 29 and even smaller shares for those ages 50 and older (41%). Among those in relationships, younger adults also are more likely than older adults to assert that their partner is often distracted by their phone when they are trying to have a discussion (20% vs. 10%).\nWomen who are in a relationship are more likely than men to say their partner is often distracted by their phone while they are trying to hold a conversation, but this gender difference is most pronounced among younger adults. Three-in-ten partnered women ages 18 to 29 say their significant other is often distracted by their phone while they are trying to hold a conversation, compared with 15% of men in this age group who say this.\nAbout one-in-three partnered adults say they have looked through their current spouse or partner\u2019s phone without their knowledge, but there\u2019s strong public consensus this is unacceptable\nAmericans \u2013 regardless of whether they are in a relationship \u2013 were asked in the survey about their views about some issues related to technology and relationships. For example, they weighed in on the acceptability of looking through a significant other\u2019s phone without that person\u2019s knowledge. Seven-in-ten U.S. adults say it is rarely (28%) or never (42%) acceptable to look through a significant other\u2019s cellphone without their knowledge. Smaller shares \u2013 about three-in-ten (29%) \u2013 view this behavior as at least sometimes acceptable.\nMajorities across major demographic groups view these actions as unacceptable, but there are some Americans who are more accepting of this behavior than others.\nWomen are more likely than men to think it is at least sometimes acceptable for someone to look through their partner\u2019s cellphone without their knowledge (35% vs. 24%). And about one-third of adults under the age of 65 (33%) view this as acceptable, compared with 16% of those 65 and older.\nAmericans\u2019 views on the acceptability of looking through a partner\u2019s phone varies by current relationship status. Americans who are married or cohabiting are more likely than those who are single or in a committed relationship to say that looking through a significant other\u2019s phone without that person\u2019s knowledge is sometimes or always acceptable.\nDespite the overall public uneasiness with this type of digital snooping, there are some Americans who report that they have looked through their significant other\u2019s phone without that person\u2019s knowledge. Roughly one-third of partnered adults (34%) say they have done this, but there are substantial differences by gender, age and relationship status when it comes to looking through a significant other\u2019s phone.\nAmong adults who are partnered, women are far more likely than men to report that they have looked through their current partner\u2019s phone without that person\u2019s knowledge (42% vs. 25%). And while 52% of partnered adults ages 18 to 29 say they have done this, those shares are 41% among those ages 30 to 49, 29% among those ages 50 to 64 and 13% among those 65 and older.\nThese actions also vary by the type of relationship. Roughly four-in-ten Americans (41%) who are living with a partner report that they have looked through their current partner\u2019s phone without that person\u2019s knowledge, compared with 27% of those who are in committed relationship and 34% of those who are married. However, this pattern is largely due age differences in relationship status, as twice as many adults under 50 live with a partner than do those 50 and older. While 48% cohabiters under 50 report having gone through their partner\u2019s phone without that person\u2019s knowledge, only 18% of cohabiters ages 50 and older say the same.\nThere also are some differences by race and ethnicity. About half of Hispanic adults who are in a relationship say they have looked through their partner\u2019s phone, compared with a third among their black or white counterparts.\nThose in partnered relationships also are more likely to look through their partner\u2019s cellphone without that person\u2019s knowledge if they think it is acceptable to do so (61% say they have done this). Smaller shares of partnered adults who deem this unacceptable say they have personally gone through their current partner\u2019s phone \u2013 though still about one-in-five say they have done this.\nIt is fairly common for partners to share the password or passcode to their cellphone\nOverall, sharing passwords to digital devices or accounts is a fairly common practice in romantic relationships. In the October 2019 survey, a majority of Americans who are married, cohabiting or in a committed relationship say they have given their spouse or partner the password for their cellphone (75%), their email account (62%) or any of their social media accounts (42%).3\nStill, experiences do vary depending on the type of relationship partnered people have. Married or cohabiting adults are much more likely to share their cellphone or social media passwords with their partner than those who are in a committed relationship but are not living with their partner. Roughly three-quarters or more of married adults (79%) or those who live with a partner (74%) say they have given their partner the password to their cellphone, compared with 58% of those who are in a committed relationship. A similar pattern is present among partnered social media users when they are asked about whether they have shared their login information for any of their social media accounts. When it comes to email password sharing, married adults are the most likely group to say they have given their email password to their partner: 70% say this, compared with 50% of cohabiting internet users and just 22% of those in a committed relationship.\nThere also are some differences by age. Among partnered adults, those ages 18 to 49 are more likely than those ages 50 and older to say they have given their cellphone password to their spouse or partner (81% vs. 69%). On the other hand, older adults are more likely than younger adults to say they have shared their email password with their significant other (70% vs. 59%).\nMost social media users see other people post about their relationship or dating life, but relatively few say these posts affect how they feel about their own relationship\nThis survey conducted last fall also examined how social media might be affecting the way people think about their own love lives. More specifically, does seeing relationship posts on social media affect the way people think about their own relationships?\nOverall, eight-in-ten social media users see others post about their relationship on social media often or sometimes. This differs by both age and gender. Women are slightly more likely than men to see these posts (84% vs. 77%). In addition, 90% of social media users ages 18 to 49 say they see these types of post at least sometimes, compared with 68% of those ages 50 and older.\nA majority of social media users who are in a relationship (81%) say they see posts about other people\u2019s relationships when using social media. Among these partnered social media users, 78% of those who are married say they at least sometimes see posts about other people\u2019s relationships, compared with 89% of those who are living with partner and 86% of those in a committed relationship.\nOverall, seeing these posts appears to have little effect on how people view their own romantic relationships. A large majority of partnered adults (81%) who at least sometimes see posts about other people\u2019s relationships say that these posts have not made much of difference in how they feel about their own relationship. On the other hand, relatively few say these posts make them feel better (9%) or worse (9%) about their relationship.\nWhen it comes to social media users who are single and looking, 87% see other people making posts about their relationships on social media platforms at least sometimes. Social media users who are single and not looking for a relationship or dates are less likely to report seeing these types of posts at least sometimes (78%).\nA third of the social media users who are single and looking and who say they see others\u2019 posts about their love life say that seeing these posts makes them feel worse. This compares with 62% who report that such posts by others do not make much of a difference in how they feel about their own dating life. Just 4% say it makes them feel better.\nThese relationship-focused posts tend to have a bigger impact on women than men. Among social media users who are single and looking, women who see relationships posts at least sometimes are more likely to report that seeing these posts on social media makes them feel worse about their dating lives than are their male counterparts (40% vs. 28%).\nAbout three-in-ten social media users say they have discussed their love life on social media\nWhile it is fairly common for social media users to come across other people posting things about their love lives, only a minority of Americans who use these platforms (28%) say they have ever shared or discussed things about their relationship or dating life. About four-in-ten adults who are living with their partner (39%) and nearly half of those in a committed relationship (48%) but not living together say they have ever posted about their relationship on social media. Conversely, married and single adults are the least likely to post about their love lives (24% and 26%, respectively).\nAbout four-in-ten social media users who are either Hispanic or lesbian, gay or bisexual (LGB) say they have ever posted about their dating life or relationship on social media, while around one-quarter of white, black and straight social media users say the same.\nYounger social media users also are more likely to have posted about their love lives on social media previously. While about half of social media users ages 18 to 29 have ever posted on social media about their dating life or relationship, a third of 30- to 49-year-olds say the same. By comparison, far fewer social media users ages 50 and older (11%) say they ever post about their relationship or dating life.\nRoughly half of social media users have used these sites to check up on an ex-romantic partner\nUsing social media to check up on former romantic partners is a fairly common practice among social media users. About half of social media users (53%) say they have used these sites to check up on someone with whom they were in a relationship or whom they used to date.\nSocial media users ages 18 to 49 are far more likely than those ages 50 and older to report using social media to check up on an ex-romantic partner. Seven-in-ten 18- to 29-year-olds report that they have used these platforms to check up on someone they used to date or be in a relationship with. That share is lower \u2013 though still a majority \u2013 among users ages 30 to 49 and falls sharply among those ages and 50 and older.\nThere also are some notable differences, depending on a person\u2019s relationship status. About two-thirds each of social media users who are cohabiting or in a committed relationship say they have used social media to check up on someone they used to date. Meanwhile, 56% of single people, and even fewer married people (45%), say the same. In addition, social media users who have a high school degree or less education are less likely to report that they have used to social media to check up on an ex-romantic partner than those with a bachelor\u2019s or advanced degree or who have some college experience.\nYounger Americans in relationships are especially likely to view social media as having an important role in connecting and keeping up with their partner\nOverall, about three-in-ten partnered adults who use social media say that these sites are at least somewhat important in showing how much they care about their partner (33%) or keeping up with what is going on in their partner\u2019s life (28%). But the level of importance that these users place on social media varies substantially by age. Among partnered social media users, 48% of 18- to 29-year-olds say these platforms are very or somewhat important in how they show how much they care about their partner, compared with 28% of those ages 30 and older who say this.\nThere also are age differences when it comes to the importance social media users place on these platforms for keeping up with their significant other\u2019s life. About four-in-ten partnered users ages 18 to 29 say social media is somewhat or very important when it comes to keeping up with what\u2019s going on in their partner\u2019s life, compared with 29% of those ages 30 to 49 and only 17% of those ages 50 and older.\nMarried social media users are more likely than those who are cohabiting or in a committed relationship to say they do not see social media as important for keeping up with what\u2019s going on in their partner\u2019s life or for showing how much they care about their partner.\nThe level of importance that partnered adults place on social media also varies by race and ethnicity as well as by sexual orientation. Nonwhite social media users are more likely than white users to say these platforms are a very or somewhat important for keeping up with their partner\u2019s life and showing how much they care.4 Among partnered social media users, LGB adults are more likely than those who are straight to say social media is at least somewhat important for keeping up with their partner\u2019s life or showing how much they care.\nEven when controlling for age, racial and ethnic differences persist when it comes to the likelihood of saying social media is a personally important way to keep up with one\u2019s partner or show how much they care. Similarly, marital status and sexual orientation are significant predictors of how important it is for people to use social media to keep up with one\u2019s partner, even after controlling for age differences.\nSocial media can be a source of jealousy and uncertainty in relationships \u2013 especially for younger adults\nEven as younger Americans value social media as a place to share how much they care about their partner or to keep up with what\u2019s going on in their partner\u2019s life, they also acknowledge some of the downsides that these sites can have on relationships.\nOverall, 23% of partnered adults whose significant other uses social media say they have felt jealous or unsure about their relationship because of the way their current spouse or partner interacts with other people on social media. But this share is even higher among those in younger age groups.\nAmong partnered adults whose significant other uses social media, 34% of 18- to 29-year-olds and 26% of those ages 30 to 49 say they have felt jealous or unsure in their current relationship because of how their partner interacted with others on social media, compared with 19% of those ages 50 to 64 who say this and 4% of those ages 65 and up. Nearly four-in-ten unmarried adults with partners who are social media users (37%) say they have felt this way about their current partner, while only 17% of married people say the same.\nWomen also are more likely to express displeasure with how their significant other interacts with others on social media. Women who say their partner uses social media are more likely than men to say they have felt jealous or unsure of their relationships because of how their partner interacts with others on social media (29% vs. 17%).\nAmong those whose partner uses social media, about three-in-ten nonwhite adults who are in a relationship report having felt jealous or uncertain in their current relationship based on their partner\u2019s social media interactions, compared with 19% of white adults who say the same. About one-third of LGB partnered adults whose significant other uses social media report that they have felt jealous or unsure in their current relationship because of how their partner interacted with others on social media, while 22% of straight people say this. College graduates are less likely to report having felt this way than those with some college experience or a high school degree or less."

  "argos_summary": "The article discusses the ethical implications of snooping through a partner's phone, highlighting that nearly 30% of American adults find it acceptable under certain circumstances. It contrasts this with the growing trend among Generation Z towards 'quiet relationships,' where individuals prefer to keep their romantic lives private and off social media to avoid scrutiny and unrealistic comparisons. Experts suggest that while snooping is generally viewed as a breach of trust, 'sleuthing' through publicly available information on social media can be seen as a more acceptable way to gauge a partner's behavior.",
