  "title": "Yankees\u2019 Giancarlo Stanton expected to play right field on Saturday, first time since 2023",
  "description": "Stanton, 35, has been coming off the bench since Aaron Judge returned as a DH earlier this week.",
  "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 No player in MLB gets down the first base line slower than New York Yankees designated hitter Giancarlo Stanton. Only three players in the sport have a slower sprint speed than Stanton, and each is either a catcher or a first baseman. Despite Stanton\u2019s lack of speed \u2014 and his injury history \u2014 the Yankees are planning on having Stanton play right field at Yankee Stadium on Saturday against the Houston Astros, manager Aaron Boone said Friday.\n\nAaron Judge is limited to being the Yankees\u2019 designated hitter right now, as he works his way back from a right flexor tendon strain. The only way to get Stanton\u2019s bat in the lineup is for him to play the outfield, which he hasn\u2019t done since 2023. Part of the reasoning behind having Stanton play right field on Saturday is that the Astros are starting left-hander Framber Valdez, and Stanton crushes lefty pitching.\n\nStanton has not played since Tuesday, and even that appearance was only in a pinch-hit situation against the Texas Rangers. The Yankees did not want Stanton playing the outfield on Globe Life Field\u2019s turf surface, and the club remains adamant that the 35-year-old will only play the outfield in certain parks. Yankee Stadium\u2019s right field is one of the smallest areas for outfielders to cover across MLB.\n\nBut Stanton playing the outfield in any park invites risk. He has dealt with numerous lower-body injuries over the past several seasons, and he missed over two months this season with tennis elbow in both arms. Boone said he does not believe Stanton\u2019s elbows will be impacted by throwing, but he acknowledged that they need to be cautious with the slugger.\n\n\u201cI do feel like, physically, he\u2019s in a good place to go out and do it on a limited basis,\u201d Boone said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve kind of spent the week, 10 days, kind of ramping it up and seeing how he\u2019s doing with it. He\u2019s usually very blunt and honest about if he feels like he can do it or not, so it\u2019s never risk-free. I do feel like he could (play). He should be in position to handle it on a limited basis.\u201d\n\nStanton has not graded positively as an outfielder in outs above average since 2018, his first season with the Yankees. Luis Rojas, who coaches the Yankees\u2019 outfielders, said he has no concern with how Stanton will handle his defensive responsibilities.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s something that he\u2019s not going to be out there embarrassing himself or costing the team anything,\u201d Rojas said. \u201cI know he\u2019s going to be in good shape to make plays. But, progressively, we don\u2019t have a timeline for when he\u2019s going to say, \u2018This is it. I\u2019m ready.\u2019 I just really trust his feel right now.\u201d\n\nSince making his season debut in mid-June, Stanton\u2019s 137 wRC+ ranks third on the Yankees behind Cody Bellinger and Judge. That said, the Yankees\u2019 offense has not been the club\u2019s biggest issue during their summer swoon, but rather it\u2019s been sloppy defense and poor pitching.\n\nBoone said Stanton has told him that he believes he can handle playing right field again.\n\n\u201cG\u2019s usually brutally honest in those situations,\u201d Boone said. \u201cI think he\u2019s feeling good about where he\u2019s at.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees will take a massive risk in having Stanton play the field for the first time in two years. But the only way to have Stanton in the lineup is for him to play right field. The Yankees are still unsure of when Judge will return to playing right field. He started throwing earlier this week, and the plan is for him to gradually build up in a regimented throwing program.",

      "text": "NEW YORK \u2014 Whether the oft-injured Giancarlo Stanton, who hasn\u2019t played the outfield in nearly two years, appears on defense for the New York Yankees anytime soon will depend largely on one thing:\nDoes he think he can do it?\n\u201cI really want him to communicate with me how he feels, because I know at this point in his career, for as long as he\u2019s played the game, he\u2019s going to know how he feels on a day-to-day basis,\u201d outfield coordinator and third-base coach Luis Rojas said before Tuesday\u2019s game against the Tampa Bay Rays at Yankee Stadium.\nAdvertisement\nThe Yankees are hoping to prepare Stanton for the possibility that he plays some outfield to keep his bat in the lineup when Aaron Judge (right flexor tendon strain) returns from the injured list initially as a designated hitter while he ramps up his throwing program.\nManager Aaron Boone said the Yankees still believe Judge may be able to come off the IL as soon as the 10-day period ends. On Tuesday, Judge did light work in the batting cage for the first time since going on the IL, Boone said.\nOn Monday, Stanton began his first steps toward possibly returning to the outfield, taking ground balls in right field from Rojas and throwing them lightly to second base. Stanton hasn\u2019t been anything other than a DH since Sept. 14, 2023.\nGiancarlo Stanton light work in RF pic.twitter.com/R3HM7wx9tw\n\u2014 Brendan Kuty \ud83e\udddf\u2642\ufe0f (@BrendanKutyNJ) July 28, 2025\nOn Saturday, Stanton said that he\u2019ll \u201cbe ready when needed.\u201d\nWhen will that be? It\u2019s unclear. Stanton didn\u2019t work out in the outfield Tuesday. Rojas said the plan was to go slow with Stanton, who missed the first 70 games of the year with tennis elbow in both of his elbows. Stanton also runs the bases slowly and gingerly, as if he\u2019s trying not to hurt himself.\n\u201cYou have to,\u201d Rojas said. \u201cHe\u2019s already been through an injury this year. He\u2019s a guy who knows his body very well.\u201d\nStanton hasn\u2019t rated as an above-average right fielder in terms of Outs Above Average (OAA) since 2018, his first year with the Yankees, according to Baseball Savant.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s something that he\u2019s not going to be out there embarrassing himself or costing the team anything,\u201d Rojas said. \u201cI know he\u2019s going to be in good shape to make plays. But, progressively, we don\u2019t have a timeline for when he\u2019s going to say, \u2018This is it. I\u2019m ready.\u2019 I just really trust his feel right now.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nRojas added that while catcher/first baseman/DH Ben Rice isn\u2019t being discussed as a possible option in right field, the idea came up briefly in April. Rice, 26, has never played outfield in a professional game, but he would occasionally take fly balls when he was with Double-A Somerset, which, at the time, had a glut of catchers.\n\u201cJokingly, we talked about it at the beginning of the season,\u201d Rojas said, \u201cknowing that Stanton was going to come back (off the injured list). Everyone was curious about what was going to happen because Giancarlo was on his way, and this kid (Rice) rakes. You already have two catchers. So, what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d\nRice never ended up working out in the outfield, but Rojas didn\u2019t dismiss the idea entirely.\n\u201cCan he do it?\u201d Rojas said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a big-league player who isn\u2019t necessarily a slow guy. He\u2019s got some ability. There\u2019s some speed in him. Not bursting speed, but speed that can hold up in right field, for example. He could. But let\u2019s see what the decision is for our manager or the higher-ups, or how the team is going to shape up in a couple days. But right now, the plan is Giancarlo, and like I said, he\u2019s just taking it day to day right now.\u201d\n(Photo: Vincent Carchietta / Imagn Images)"

Manager Aaron Boone expressed confidence in Stanton's ability to handle limited outfield duties, especially against left-handed pitchers, while Stanton has not played the outfield since 2023. The decision is influenced by the need to keep Stanton's bat in the lineup while Aaron Judge recovers from injury, although the Yankees remain cautious about Stanton's physical condition.",
