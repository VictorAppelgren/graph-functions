      "summary": "The Trump administration conducted an airstrike on a drug‑laden boat in the south Caribbean, killing 11 suspected Tren de Aragua gang members. Officials offered little detail on the legal authority or intelligence, citing broad post‑9/11 counterterrorism authorizations. The strike raises questions about U.S. extraterritorial use of force, the legality of targeting drug traffickers in international waters, and the broader implications for Caribbean security and U.S. foreign policy.",
