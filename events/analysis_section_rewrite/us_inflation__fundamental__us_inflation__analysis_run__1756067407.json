      "feedback": "This analysis would be world‑class if you tighten the structure around a clear, multi‑year regime map, anchor every claim to first‑principles invariants, and quantify the transmission from AI and policy to asset pricing, while cleanly reconciling divergent sources. Actionable edits: rewrite as a three‑regime, multi‑year framework anchored by invariant anchors (1) productivity IMF/TFP gain from AI and capital deepening, (2) policy reaction functions toward selective industrial re‑casting, and (3) BoP/terms‑of‑trade implications of tariffs and reshoring. Define Regimes with explicit transition conditions: Regime A (slow dislocation, productive AI uptake, muted inflation) vs Regime B (rapid displacement with insufficient retraining, wage scarcity, rising risk premia) versus Regime C (tariff/decoupling shock with inflation spillovers). Specify catalysts/triggers and invalidation points: e.g., surveillance of AI adoption pace and investment momentum in semis/data centers (Capex outlook in Ford/Model E and domestic chip builds), tariff trajectory and energy pricing, wage growth versus productivity, and BoP pressures that would force FX/valuation re‑pricing; invalidate high‑confidence scenarios if unemployment rises meaningfully beyond a threshold or if BoP deteriorates beyond a small sustained gap. Quantify with the sourced numbers: 25% of US employment with high automation exposure and 36 million jobs at risk (Brookings, NL5YYTLF2); UBI debates and Finland trial outcomes; Ford/Auto sector specifics (Ford Q2 EV loss of about $1.3B, Q2 operating margin ~4.3%, ROIC ~10.1%, 17% YTD price gain but long‑term underperformance vs S&P) and EV capex (up to $50B through 2026 with $12B paused) (Ford analysis in 22PL3Q360 and W2622L6WW); multi‑year tariff/industrial policy signals and their inflationary risks (Trump‑era tariff discussions and implied price effects across consumer goods) (SGB2PAZGK, multiple Fox sources). Build a clean causal chain: AI adoption drives capital deepening and sector reallocation (semis/data centers, AI tooling) → new supply chains and reshoring raise capex and sector margins in strategic industries but compress consumer margins in cyclical goods if tariff/energy costs rise → asset pricing shifts in cyclicals (Ford‑type equities) and in capex‑rich sectors; tariff regimes elevate consumer prices and potentially anchor higher inflation expectations, feeding into risk premia and equity multiples. Elevate coverage across critical inputs: maintain NL5YYTLF2 for identity/psychology channel, SGB2PAZGK for trade policy context, 22PL3Q360/W2622L6WW for automotive cyclicality and EV economics, and YVQU6QCY4 for household retirement demand and consumption risk, while explicitly flagging the ideological bias in Fox/Trump‑era sources and cross‑check with neutral data when available. Improve coherence by a closing base case: a gradual but uneven re‑equipment of the economy with AI productivity gains and domestic capex, offset by near‑term inflation risk if tariffs persist, and a medium‑term re‑pricing of traditional cyclicals as the transition allocates labor toward higher‑productivity sectors; outline 2–3 key watchpoints (CAPEX momentum in semis/AI infra, wage growth vs productivity, and BoP/FX signals) and state a clear confidence band.
