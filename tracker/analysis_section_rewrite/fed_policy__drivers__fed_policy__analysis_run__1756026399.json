      "feedback": "The piece has a solid long‑horizon thesis (21.2% CAGR to 2030) and credible near‑term inflation/capital‑cost signals, but its causal chain is underdeveloped, its horizon framing is uneven, and its quantitative grounding is incomplete and inconsistently cited; it also leaves several relevant cross‑topic signals underutilized or unmanaged (e.g.,Intel/Marijuana/urban‑policy signals) and does not fully reconcile competing source narratives. Actionable edits: restructure into a crisp three‑horizon framework (near term 0–12m, medium term 1–3y, long run 3–7y) and lay out a explicit causal chain from AI/cloud capex and data advantages to margin uplift and long‑run FCF, then to firm/industry multiples via cost of capital; connect each link to first‑principles drivers (ROIC/WACC, capex intensity, data moat, labor productivity) with explicit numeric sensitivities; quantify the impact of key levers (inflation path, capex cycles, energy backdrop, cost of capital) on multiples and FCF, e.g., provide scenario‑based valuation ranges (base, bull, bear) anchored to the cited numbers (0G3A676BP; V7GV8YBQU; TN66GHPAT; 4LQD15CFU; J99EM2TPZ) and show how a 50–100 bps shift in the 10Y or a 2–3 mbpd oil‑price swing would alter the outcome; add a concise watchlist of 5 decisive signals (inflation prints and core services momentum; AI/CPU capex surveys and productivity metrics; capex financing/credit conditions; energy‑supply signaling; dividend yield regime) with explicit invalidation triggers; reconcile tensions across sources (oil oversupply easing inflation vs persistent services inflation; higher cost of capital vs AI‑driven productivity gains) and explicitly state what would invalidate the base case (e.g., a sustained inflation surprise, a policy regime that meaningfully tightens multiples beyond earnings growth, or a durable energy demand shock). Expand coverage only to sources that materially affect the cross‑topic synthesis or clearly justify omission (if you keep Intel/Marijuana/urban‑policy signals, treat them as discrete risk channels with named catalysts rather than buried in prose). Tighten citation discipline by placing each major claim on the cross‑topic spine directly after the associated ID (0G3A676BP for the base‑case thesis; V7GV8YBQU for inflation, TN66GHPAT for capital/justness and yields, 4LQD15CFU for the Workers Leaders/IBM catalyst, J99EM2TPZ for oil) and prune any redundant mentions to avoid overloading the narrative. This will produce a world‑class, first‑principles, scenario‑driven, and decision‑oriented analysis aligned with the SECTION FOCUS.",
