      "summary": "Japanese nail salon operator Convano has announced a $3 billion Bitcoin acquisition plan to buy 21,000 BTC (≈0.1 % of supply) by March 2027, citing yen depreciation and geopolitical risk as drivers. The company will raise funds through bonds and share issuance, targeting 2,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 10,000 BTC by August 2026. Convano’s move follows a trend of Japanese firms, such as Metaplanet, expanding crypto treasuries amid a weak yen and regulatory shifts. The announcement has lifted Convano’s stock, which surged over 1,400 % YTD, while the market watches the sustainability of corporate crypto holdings.",
