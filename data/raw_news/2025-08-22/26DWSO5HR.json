  "description": "A guide to some of the biggest events taking place in the West this bank holiday weekend.",
  "content": "The weather is set fair for the August bank holiday weekend and there are plenty of festivals and fun days taking place across the West to keep the family entertained.\n\nWe have put together a selection of them for you to choose from - wherever you live.\n\nOrganised by the team behind Love Saves the Day, Forwards Festival is back for its third year with a big focus on information and talks alongside the live music.\n\nAbout 60,000 people are expected at this weekend's event on The Downs, which will provide a stage for international artists including Jorja Smith, Barry Can't Swim and Ezra Collective, as well as some of the West's best emerging acts.\n\nBilled as the \"world's greatest\" classical music festival, BBC Proms returns to Bristol for the second year in a row for a weekend of concerts.\n\nSprawling out from the main concert hall to the building's public spaces and beyond, the concerts will encompass everything from performances by the Danish National Vocal ensemble, Paraorchestra and Britten Sinfonia, to a classical DJ set.\n\nBristol Beacon's chief executive, Simon Wales, said: \"Our Proms weekend is a really kind of genre-defying combination of all different types of music, from local artists to international.\"\n\nOld City Sounds will return to Bristol city centre on Saturday.\n\nThe free music event takes over some of the city's most popular venues in King Street, Welsh Back and St Nicholas Street and will feature a wide variety of genres.\n\n\"Old City Sounds brings the city's spirit to life and we're proud to showcase both Bristol's incredible musical talent and the thriving local economy at the heart of the Old City,\" said director of Bristol City Centre BID, Vicky Lee.\n\nNational Racehorse Week starts on Saturday and Fergal O'Brien is opening his Gloucestershire yard to engage the public with the world of horse racing.\n\nVisitors will be able to see behind-the-scenes at the yard, meet top-tier jockeys and tour the gallops.\n\n\"It's a great way for people to have an insight into national hunt race horses and how they're cared for, and to see the full circle of a race horse's career and life,\" said Mr O'Brien.\n\nNow celebrating its 10th anniversary, Gloucester Goes Retro is one of the \"highlights\" of the city's calendar with hundreds of classic cars and bikes on display, along with vintage fashion and live music to enjoy.\n\n\"It's just such a wonderful atmosphere in the town, it's probably the best day of the year in Gloucester because it encompasses so much of the city,\" said Gary Boon from Gloster Swing Dance.\n\nGloucester Cathedral is hosting its first-ever Stone Carving Festival with the poignant theme of Peace and Remembrance in this 80th anniversary year of VE Day.\n\nFor three days, stonemasons will come together on Cathedral Green to chisel, carve and shape sculptures, which will be auctioned after the event to support cathedral conservation work.\n\nSenior stonemason Paul Synan said: \"The Stone Carving Festival is a fantastic opportunity to show people the skill and craftsmanship that goes into carving stone at Gloucester Cathedral.\"\n\nWhile strictly not a festival, it would be amiss not to include this well known bank holiday event in Bourton-on-the-Water.\n\nHundreds of spectators are expected to watch the players of Bourton Rovers Football Club play against each other in the River Windrush, which is ankle-deep as it flows through the Cotswolds village.\n\nThe fundraising event is said to have started about 120 years ago when drinkers in a riverside pub got bored one day and decided to stage an impromptu match in the water.\n\nAhead of the 2025/2026 season at The Rec, rugby fans are being invited to a family fun day at Bath Rugby Club.\n\nThe day will provide a chance for fans to meet their favourite players with selfie and signing opportunities, live music and other activities.\n\nTraining takes place at 13:00 BST when you can watch the team being put through their paces by Head of Rugby Johann van Graan and other coaching staff.\n\nFormerly called the Clevedon Flower Show, this event is now much more than just about flowers - there are arts and crafts stalls and produce of all sorts for sale as well as flower and vegetable competitions, live music and a dog show.\n\nThe event has been a popular attraction in the town for more than 125 years.\n\nOne of the largest celebrations of Ukrainian culture in the UK is taking place in Swindon on Saturday.\n\nFolk and traditional dance groups will be performing at UkraineFest 2025, along with Ukrainian bands and artists.\n\nKris Taikowski, vice-chairman of organisers Swindon Welcomes Ukraine, said \"We shine a light on a war that has not ended, on families still suffering, on a nation still fighting.\"\n\nSummer at the Green - 2 August to 25 August\n\nSwindon's month-long festival ends this weekend with a pop-up planetarium and activities including a virtual reality flying experience and a fossil dig.\n\nThe town centre space, Wharf Green, has hosted a range of events each weekend in August, with midweek sessions also held on Wednesdays.\n\nSwindon Borough Council's cabinet member for placemaking and planning, Marina Strinkovsky, said the events were a chance for Swindonians to \"learn and find out more exciting and amazing things that are happening in their town that maybe they didn't know about before\".\n\nSalisbury Fire Station is raising money for the Firefighters Charity on Saturday with activities laid on by the Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service.\n\nThere will be demonstrations including hot oil fires and using the aerial ladder, as well as a display of engines and a specialist airport vehicle from Boscombe Down airfield.\n\nFirefighter Sam Edwards said: \"We're building on the success of the last three years and the event should be bigger and better than ever.\"\n\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

This quirky and beloved local tradition has become a highlight of the summer, drawing crowds from near and far to the picturesque village of Bourton-on-the-Water.\nA Tradition Steeped in History\nThe origins of Football in the River date back to the early 20th century, making it a century-old tradition. What started as a playful kickabout in the River Windrush has grown into an iconic event that embodies the spirit and charm of our village. Each year, on the August Bank Holiday, our football pitch moves from the grassy fields to the shallow waters of the Windrush, right in the heart of Bourton-on-the-Water.\nThe Event Itself\nThe match takes place in the shallow river, which flows gently through the center of Bourton-on-the-Water. The game is played between two teams, made up of Bourton Rovers players. The rules are similar to traditional football, but with the added challenge of playing in ankle-deep water. The river\u2019s natural obstacles, combined with the unpredictability of water splashes and slippery stones, make for a match full of laughter, fun, and unexpected turns.\nA Spectacle for All Ages\nSpectators line the stone bridges and grassy banks, eager to witness the fun-filled chaos that ensues. The match typically lasts around 30 minutes, with both teams vying to score as many goals as possible while trying to stay upright. The event is as much about entertainment as it is about football, with players often ending up drenched from head to toe, much to the delight of the crowd.\nCommunity Spirit and Charity\nFootball in the River is more than just a sporting event; it\u2019s a celebration of community spirit. The event brings together locals and visitors alike, creating a festive atmosphere that epitomizes the warm and welcoming nature of Bourton-on-the-Water. What\u2019s more, the event serves as a fundraiser for our local football club, with proceeds from the day going to support grassroots football.\nJoin Us for the Next Match!\nWhether you\u2019re a football fan or just looking for a fun day out, Football in the River offers a unique experience that you won\u2019t find anywhere else. Bring your family, enjoy the vibrant atmosphere, and cheer on the teams as they navigate the watery pitch. With plenty of local stalls, refreshments, and activities to enjoy, it\u2019s a day out that promises something for everyone.\nMark your calendars for August Bank Holiday Monday, and come down to Bourton-on-the-Water to be part of this historic and joyful event. We look forward to welcoming you to the next Football in the River match!\nBourton Rovers Football Club is excited to continue this beloved tradition, and we hope to see you at the river, cheering, splashing, and enjoying the fun!"

      "text": "Forwards Festival: Here's what you need to know\n- Published\nFestival season continues in the West with Bristol's Forwards Festival, organised by the team behind Love Saves the Day.\nA relatively new event, the annual festival began in 2022, and has a big focus on information and talks alongside the music.\nAround 60,000 people are expected at this weekend's event, which will provide a stage for international artists including Jorja Smith, Barry Can't Swim and Ezra Collective, as well as some of the West's best emerging acts.\nHere is all you need to know if you are planning to head there.\nWhere and when is it?\nForwards is taking place at Durdham Downs (The Downs) in Clifton on Saturday and Sunday, the bank holiday weekend.\nWho is performing?\nOne of the biggest names over the weekend was set to be US rapper Doechii, who headlined the West Holts stage at this year's Glastonbury. Unfortunately, it was announced on Tuesday morning that she would no longer be performing.\nOrganisers say they are looking for a replacement.\nMeanwhile, Jorja Smith, Olivia Dean and The Last Dinner Party will all take to the stage on Sunday.\nOn Saturday, Scottish DJ and producer Barry Can't Swim and Mercury Prize-winning band Ezra Collective are top of the bill. Amongst others, they are joined by Confidence Man, Orbital and English Teacher.\nSome of the West's finest acts will also grace the stage, including Stroud's Katy J Pearson, Bristol's Ishmael Ensemble, joined by The Ritual Orchestra and Waldo's Gift, also from Bristol.\nWhat else is going on?\nAlongside the huge music line-up, there is a big emphasis on the festival's information area, with talks on topics including climate change, politics and cultural currency.\nThis year comedian Munya Chawawa, broadcaster Carol Vorderman and MP Zarah Sultana are among the speakers you will find at the Information Stage.\nCan I camp there?\nNo. Like many other city festivals, Forwards is not a camping one.\nIt is very easy to get there on public transport though and there will be a special shuttle bus running throughout the weekend.\nCan I still get tickets?\nTickets for Sunday and those for the whole weekend are sold out, but you can still get your hands on tickets for Saturday.\nWhat else do I need to know?\nForwards is an accessible event, including an induction loop, British Sign Language interpreters and a sensory break-out space, but organisers have warned the ground could get churned up if there is extreme wet weather.\nChildren are allowed but must be accompanied by a responsible adult. Children over four years old will need to purchase either a kids or a teen ticket.\nIt is a cashless festival, so you will need to be able to pay for onsite food and drink via a card or phone.\nGet in touch\nTell us which stories we should cover in Bristol\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.
