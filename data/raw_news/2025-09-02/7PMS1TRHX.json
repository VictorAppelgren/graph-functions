  "description": "Why risk-based vulnerability management is key to effective cybersecurity",
  "content": "What are the pitfalls of treating every vulnerability as \u201curgent\u201d?\n\nI see many organizations fall into the \u201cpatch everything now\u201d trap, treating any delay as a ticking time bomb. Ironically, this constant sense of urgency can make for a less efficient patch management process.\n\nChasing every CVE as though it were a zero-day can quickly lead to alert fatigue, with teams feeling numb and burned out. If everything is critical, nothing is, and then genuinely severe flaws get lost in the noise.\n\nContext is our antidote. Teams need to know why they are prioritizing a vulnerability, rather than just tackling every incoming issue or blindly following risk scores.\n\nA risk-based patching strategy starts by defining \u201ccritical\u201d through your own operational lens, not just generic scores. In traditional models, teams often chase high CVSS numbers or the latest zero-day headlines \u2013 and then wonder why budgets explode and nothing ever feels \u201cdone.\u201d\n\nThere are three key questions to help work this out: what asset is affected, how exposed is it, and what real-world exploit data exists?\n\nFor instance, a vulnerability in a customer-facing payments server ranks far higher than one on an isolated development box. By overlaying CVSS scores with threat intelligence, such as proof-of-concept exploits or active weaponization, and tagging assets by business function, we bring true urgency back into focus.\n\nThis hybrid scoring model shrinks your urgent backlog to a manageable level so teams can execute confidently. However, this is only possible if work is put in to establish full situational awareness in advance.\n\nHow can organizations achieve the prioritization needed for effective vulnerability management?\n\nIn my experience, it starts with knowing exactly what you have. A lot of companies really struggle with this because they have so many different tools and processes that don\u2019t connect together.\n\nSo, it\u2019s essential to consolidate all scanner outputs, IT systems, cloud services, code, and external surfaces into a single inventory. Without that unified view, prioritization is guesswork.\n\nNext, layer in threat intelligence feeds. Look for indicators of active exploitation: proof-of-concept code, wormable vulnerabilities or entries in CISA\u2019s Known Exploitability Vulnerabilities catalogue. Suddenly, a static list of CVEs becomes a dynamic map of real-world risk.\n\nThis contextual data can be used to inform a central dashboard, allowing teams to filter by asset criticality, exposure and business function easily. This makes it simple for vulnerability management teams to identify priorities through the noise. For example, you might tag production databases as \u201cTier 1\u201d and filter out low-risk test environments entirely.\n\nFinally, make enrichment a team sport. Security analysts, ops engineers and application owners should all validate and update context based on their fields. \u201cYes, that server really runs our ecommerce platform\u201d, or \u201cNo, that VM is scheduled for decommissioning,\u201d and so on. However, this collaboration is often challenging due to heavily siloed teams and practices.\n\nSo how companies bridge the silo between security and operations teams during patch management?\n\nSiloed departments can be a real problem. Without clear communication, VM teams can end up being seen as an irritation getting in the way of operations, or else find themselves jumping through hoops to make things work.\n\nBridging the security\u2013operations divide isn\u2019t a technology problem; it\u2019s a people and process challenge. I\u2019ve found that starting small creates momentum. Identify a non-critical system and volunteer your security team to assist ops in scheduling and rolling out that patch. That quick win demonstrates goodwill and shows you\u2019re a partner, not a roadblock.\n\nLanguage is also crucial to building rapport. Instead of \u201cYou must patch immediately,\u201d try \u201cWe\u2019ve identified a risk that could disrupt payroll next week, how can I help schedule a maintenance window?\u201d Framing requests around business services positions security as an enabler.\n\nFinally, codify the collaboration. Establish a shared runbook that outlines roles, SLAs and escalation paths. Automate ticket handoffs between tools so no request falls through the cracks. When both teams have clear expectations and communication channels, patches move faster and friction melts away.\n\nFostering a more collaborative culture between departments also makes it easier to achieve C-suite buy-in. The added context can be used to inform concise, impact-focused briefs, translating technical risk into results like potential downtime, customer fallout or regulatory fines. This method not only improves security outcomes but boosts confidence in IT leadership\u2019s decision-making.\n\nImprove your cybersecurity training with the best online cybersecurity courses.\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

These range from Usable Security to a Cybersecurity Capstone Project, so it\u2019s safe to say that they'll require you to already have some intermediate cybersecurity know-how under your belt.\nThere are additional cybersecurity courses available, though, covering everything from the basics to more advanced specializations.\nThere are also online degrees available in either computing and IT or data science, although none are focused specifically on cybersecurity, you can be assured that cybersecurity will be a significant part of the curriculum.\nOverall, Coursera isn't so well-presented as Future Learn, but there are potentially more accredited options for study through it.\nRead our full Coursera learning platform review.\nBest budget online cybersecurity course\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTypically, courses on Udemy cost money, but we\u2019ve found a few worth checking out that won\u2019t put a dent in your bank account.\nThe \"Cyber Security Course for Beginners - Level 01\" could also be advantageous to take, not only for cybersecurity enthusiasts but for anyone who want to learn more about the subject. This particular course offers free video content, but you will not receive a Certificate of completion, instructor Q&A or direct messages.\nHowever, Udemy's real selling point is that not only does it offer some very in-depth courses, many of these courses are extremely cost-effective.\nPaid courses worth looking for for include \"Cyber Security Crash Course for Beginners: Learn From Scratch\" but there are also others to consider such as \"The Data Science Course 2020: Complete Data Science Bootcamp\" which will help provide an insight into the intricacies of computer science.\nIt's worth underlining just how comprehensive and intensive the paid courses can be, and while they may not carry any traditional educational accreditation they could be excellent options if you wanted to consider working as a freelancer to build up some experience, and in a very cost-effective way, too.\nRead our full Udemy learning platform review.\nBest short online cybersecurity courses\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFuture Learn offers a wide range of short and free online sources, with the opportunity to pay for certificates of participation either at the course level or else access all content for a set fee. The courses themselves are well-presented in short and easy to work sections that make learning simple and interesting.\nThe \"Introduction to Cyber Security\" offers a free taster to the subject, and is accredited by UK Government intelligence organization GCHQ, global accreditation and examination institute APMG International, and The Institute of Information Security Professionals. However, there are also a small number of accredited degrees available in IT and computer science which includes a masters degree in cybersecurity.\nOverall, while Future Learn is more focused on general introductory short courses, there are paid-for and accredited learning opportunities available through the platform.\nRead our full FutureLearn learning platform review.\nBest military-grade online cybersecurity course\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNexGenT was created by two US Air Force veterans with extensive experience teaching and training network engineering and cybersecurity.\nThe cybersecurity track features two courses: Basic Training, which serves as a prerequisite, and Cyber Security Specialization. Experienced candidates, however, can skip Basic Training by taking a series of tests to prove their skills.\nBasic Training prepares you for both Full-Stack Network Associate (FSNA) and Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certificates. No prior experience is necessary, and the course is self-paced, so you can start and finish at any time.\nThe \"Cyber Security Specialization\" training course takes place over 22 weeks, covers everything you need to know to protect businesses from cyberthreats, and includes access to NexGenT\u2019s Career Services, which helps students enter the workforce upon completion.\nThe base tuition for the Cyber Security Specialization Program is costly up front at $10,500, or you can choose zero-fee tuition and pay 10% of your salary only once you have a job with a $40,000 salary. After seven years, all remaining debt is forgiven, even if you haven\u2019t paid a cent. That\u2019s how confident NexGenT is that you\u2019ll find a job and earn a living. (Although, the zero-fee tuition option seems not to be available at the moment)\nThat confidence is backed up with some impressive figures: more than 50,000 enrolled students, 460,000 classes taught, and a number of success stories attesting to the effectiveness of their training.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a solid and structured way to enter the professional world of cybersecurity, this may be the right course for you.\nFor more information, read our full NexGenT review.\nBest accredited online cybersecurity course\n5. Open University\nReasons to buy\nThe UK's Open University (OU) is a leader when it comes to distance learning, having spent decades developing its courses, and it serves an international range of students. The online portal for students is excellent with information clearly laid-out, with different modules having clear timetables to work to.\nEven better is that the courses are tailored toward people of all abilities, and do a fantastic job of easing the inexperienced and unqualified into what can be quite deep and advanced topics, while actively trying to prevent students from feeling overwhelmed.\nThe OU offers a dedicated online degree in cybersecurity, as part of its wide range of flexible Computing and IT honors degree courses, where you can choose to focus in different areas, all of which will show a concern for security issues.

      "text": "Best online collaboration tool of 2025\nMake teamwork really work\nWe list the best online collaboration software, to make it simple and easy to ensure that teamwork really works.\nAlthough collaboration tools had already been set up for office teams, the pandemic and subsequent lock down that saw many people working remotely has lead to a resurgence in collaboration tool features. The result is that collaboration has become the new normal in the workplace.\nSince employees can no longer be expected to work from the same location, this means the ability for teams to share, use, and edit files at a distance has become essential for productivity.\nHowever, collaboration tools aren't simply limited to office software such as Microsoft docs and spreadsheets, but could be anything from using cloud document storage for managing daily tasks, to video conferencing for online meetings. Even better is that the best collaboration tools will work just as well on mobile devices as well as desktops and laptops.\nAbove all, everything should be clear, easy to understand, simply to use and reduce misunderstanding. Every employee should be empowered to be able to speak to the right person, wherever they are in the company, to address the same problem. And then solve that problem within an acceptable workflow.\nThe days of collaborative working are here, so below we list what we think are the best collaboration tools currently available.\nThe Future of Teamwork. Co-create in Real-Time with Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Start Your Google Workspace Free Trial. Save 15% on Starter, Standard and Plus for 12 months (Flex & Commit).\nWe've also featured the best task management apps.\nThe best online collaboration tools of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest online collaboration tool for comms\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSlack is without doubt a mighty collaboration tool, with millions of users around the globe. It\u2019s an incredibly smart platform, and you can get it on mobile and desktop devices. It allows for the sending of direct messages (DMs) and files to a single person or a group of employees, and there\u2019s the ability to organize conversations into different channels (perhaps for specific projects, one for technical support, general chat, and so forth).\nThe app also supports video calling. You can use the feature to talk to your colleagues about projects and work in-depth, without having to type everything into a DM. While this isn\u2019t a replacement for cloud storage services, you are able to drag, drop and share files with your colleagues directly within Slack. It\u2019s also compatible with services such as Google Drive, Dropbox and Box.\nTo round things off, Slack even has a free version, although unsurprisingly it has limitations (in terms of the number of messages stored, overall storage space and so forth).\nRead our full Slack review.\nBest online collaboration tool overall\nReasons to buy\nMicrosoft Office may not be the first platform you think of when it comes to collaboration, but this now runs at the heart of the Microsoft 365 cloud-based office suite.\nThis is important because Microsoft Office remains the most used and therefore important office suite out there, and while there are competitors such as OpenOffice and Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) they still haven't caught up to the same level of functionality and ease of use.\nTherefore as Microsoft Office is likely to be at the heart of many businesses, the move to Microsoft 365 offers a number of advantages, not least the ability for teams to collaborate directly on the same set of documents. This could be anything from work shifts in an Excel spreadsheet, to a presentation in PowerPoint, to client reports written in Word.\nAdded to this is that Microsoft Teams now comes bundled with a number of Microsoft 365 packages, allowing for Unified Communications integrated with the traditional office software.\nWhat makes Microsoft 365 more attractive is that as a cloud-hosted platform it can be used not just with Windows, but also Mac, Android, and iOS.\nOverall, Microsoft 365 doesn't simply offer a great office suite, but one that is also firmly designed for collaboration and sharing with teams.\nRead our full Microsoft 365 review.\nOur Microsoft discount codes can help you save on your next purchase.\nBest all-in-one online collaboration tool\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMiro is one of those online tools that aims to bridge the gap between traditional office working and the modern hybrid routine that many of us are familiar with. It is best described as a multipurpose online collaboration tool, and its list of features is pretty extensive stretching beyond the typical realms of similar software.\nThe majority of the work you\u2019ll end up doing in Miro will revolve around what it calls boards, which start off as entirely blank spaces. Setting one up from scratch can be daunting and time-consuming, which is why the company has designed templates that you can pick from the get-go.\nSome of its most commonly accessed templates include mind maps, Kanban boards, flowcharts, product roadmaps, and timelines. Many of these will serve well as project management tools, and anybody familiar with other project management software like Airtable or Trello will already be familiar with how they work.\nOverall, we think Miro is hard to beat. Its long list of features should cover all parts of a typical business process from research and design to presentation, and its collaboration abilities are second to none. Furthermore, its transparency around security and reasonable pricing make it hard for us not to recommend it. The only thing we could wish for is better support channels.\nRead our full Miro review.\nBest online collaboration tool for tracking\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAsana has been around since 2008, making it a veteran in the collaboration arena, and companies such as Intel, Uber, Pinterest and TED all use it as their core method of communication.\nIt\u2019s been designed as an easy way for companies to track the work of employees and to get the best possible results. Using the platform, you can create to-do lists for ongoing projects, set reminders for upcoming deadlines and send requests to colleagues. Team members can also assign comments to posts within the app.\nYou can organize all your projects in a list or board format, and there\u2019s a search function so you can locate past work quickly. In short, Asana is a very effective way to stay super-organized and facilitate conversations when it comes to updates on how work is progressing.\nRead our full Asana review.\nBest online collaboration tool for organizing\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you have ever looked into project management software and online collaboration tools, then no doubt you\u2019ve come across Trello. Available on the web and with mobile apps, it lets you easily organize projects and work on them with colleagues.\nThe platform allows you to work with boards or lists, which can be organized by teams and different tasks. And within these, you can set up to-do lists and delegate amongst colleagues. There\u2019s also the option to assign comments to cards \u2013 a quick way to give feedback to others.\nFurthermore, Trello boasts a number of integrations with apps such as Evernote, GitHub, Google Drive and Slack. You can download the app for free, but there are premium options available which give access to more features.\nThe Premium pricing tier unlocks a number of additional administrative features for better organization. There's also an Enterprise edition which is priced according to the number of users required, and provides some additional organizational management features.\nRead our full Trello review.\nBest online collaboration tool space\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGoogle Workspace (formerly called G Suite) is Google's answer to Microsoft 365, and more. This is one of the best platforms you can choose for an organization because it comes with a lot of features.\nThink of this software as the enterprise version of all the popular Google tools you use. For instance, you can create custom business emails for staff that uses the same interface as the popular Gmail app. People can create and edit documents collaboratively on Google Docs; you\u2019ll see any changes in real time, and anyone is free to make comments and suggestions for any changes.\nThere's Meet, a video-conferencing solution for enterprises; this tool for valuable for colleagues to stay in touch with each other, especially for remote companies. There\u2019s also Google Chat, a messaging tool for enterprises; Google Drive for file sharing; Google Sheets for spreadsheets; and a shared calendar tool that enables colleagues to keep tabs on each other\u2019s schedules. These tools are what you\u2019ll get access to as a Google Workspace subscriber.\nA Starter plan includes 30GB storage per user and a maximum of 100 participants in video meetings. The Standard plan includes 2TB of storage and up to 150 participants in video meetings. The Plus plan includes 5TB of storage per user and up to 500 participants in video meetings. There's also an Enterprise plan that offers as much storage and video meeting participants as you need; this plan has no standard pricing, so you'll have to contact the sales team for a quote.\nYou can save on your Google Workspace subscription with our Google Workspace promo codes.\nRead our full Google Workspace review.\nBest online collaboration platform\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAirtable is a platform that supports extensive online collaboration and project management. You can use it to share data seamlessly within an organization for people to collaborate. This platform has extensive third-party integration, so you can sync data from other apps and ensure it is always up-to-date.\nAirtable is not just a standalone collaborative tool. It is actually a platform on which people can build collaborative apps. It touts itself as \u201clow-code\u201d, meaning you don\u2019t need sophisticated programming skills to build apps on it, although a little will help. Anyone in your organization can build an app on Airtable to foster collaboration.\nYou can start with the free plan, which has limitations on the file sizes and the number of collaborators. Thus, you\u2019ll need a paid plan to maximize your use of this platform, and you can choose from one of three such plans; Plus, Pro, and Enterprise.\nThe Plus plan supports an unlimited number of users. The limitation is that you'll get a maximum of 5GB space per base (which refers to a project) and a maximum of 5,000 records for each base. The Pro plan increases the storage space to 20GB per base with a maximum of 50,000 records for each base. The Enterprise plan is the highest, giving you up to 1TB of space per base and 100,000 records; this plan has no standard pricing, so you\u2019ll have to contact the sales team for a quote.\nRead our full Airtable review.\nBest online collaboration tool for mobile\nReasons to buy\nPodio describes itself as a flexible and customizable online platform for work and communication among teams. In other words, it gives you a way to organize large stacks of work and to delegate tasks between employees.\nJust like many of the other business collaboration apps out there, Podio provides you with the tools to share files, view the status of ongoing projects and get feedback on the things you\u2019re currently working on. These functionalities are combined into an easy-to-use interface.\nPodio is also equipped with quality mobile apps for when you\u2019re out and about, and need to use your smartphone or tablet, and it has an impressive amount of integration with third-party services and apps including Dropbox, Google Drive, Evernote and Zendesk.\nRead our full Podio review.\nBest online collaboration tool for ease-of-use\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRyver is similar to Slack, aiming to give your organization a highly effective means of communication, and an easy way to talk over tasks, ensuring that deadlines are met.\nWhat makes Ryver a compelling option is the fact that you can create as many teams as you want within the app, and easily categorize them to boot. As is the case with Slack, you can use the platform to set up chats with groups and individuals.\nThere are some interesting filters, too. You can control who sees the things you say and post in the app, and obviously enough, join the teams that are most relevant to you. All company posts are located within a Facebook-style newsfeed, and you can mark posts to come back to them later on.\nThere\u2019s also a host of native clients across mobile and desktop, including Mac and Linux. There's also a premium version for enterprise which offers workflow automation, Single Sign-On (SSO), and advanced team management.\nRead our full Ryver review.\nBest online collaboration tool for designers\n10. InVision\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nInVision is a collaborative tool built for designers. It provides a virtual whiteboard where multiple collaborators can share their design ideas and thoughts to come up with solutions. This whiteboard allows real-time interaction so that teams within an organization can brainstorm about work-related activities.\nThe whiteboard is called Freehand, owing its name to the fact people usually use their hands to write on whiteboards. In this case, the board is virtual, and you are free to write text while discussing with your team about a work project. You can also add images, photos, videos, etc., to provide context for your ideas.\nSometimes, you\u2019ll need templates to explain an idea to your teammates, e.g., flowcharts and interactive widgets. The good thing is that InVision provides over 200 pre-built templates that you can use for this.\nThe Freehand tool also has direct integrations with a lot of third-party software. For example, you can open a video chat by connecting to Zoom or Webex or turn your whiteboard ideas directly into tasks on Jira and Asana. If you wish, you can import your existing whiteboards from other collaborative apps, e.g., Miro.\nThis platform was built mainly for designers but is not exclusive to them. It is also suitable for product teams, human resource (HR) teams, marketing teams, etc.\nOther collaborative software to consider\nThere are many other collaboration tools worth your attention, if nothing else because of the way they apply features differently, or even add other useful features. Here we'll look at some additional online collaboration tools that could be worth exploring further:\nVisme is developed specifically for collaborative online reports, presentations, and infographics. Aside from promoting branding support and aiming to reduce design costs, analytics are provided so you can see which presentations and reports result in the most engagement, and adjust accordingly. Visme recommends itself for sales and marketing, HR and recruiting, internal communications, as well as education and in-house training. The software is specifically priced around individual, business, or education use.\nBasecamp aims to be an all-in-one collaboration and communications platform, to bring features of multiple software offerings into a single place so that it's easier to sort through information, and, of course, keep it all in one easy to manage place. Features include chat, messageboards, to-do lists and scheduling as well as automated check-in, as well as a single place to store all documents, files, and folders. Unlike other collaborative software that charges per user, Basecamp charges a single fee of $99.99 for unlimited users, which could make it especially attractive to larger organizations.\nWrike is more of a project management and scheduling tool, that makes it easy to see where everyone is in terms of completing a project. As a standalone it might seem quite limited compared to some of the others here, but its strength lies in its extensive range of integrations, which includes Google, Dropbox, Salesforce, Microsoft, Adobe, and Github. This means Wrike can work as a central platform tied to a number of others software apps, allowing you to cover a wider range of options and features than some standalone software options.\nMonday.com is a platform that allows you to plan, track, and collaborate on projects in a visually simple manner. Drag-and-drop functionality and ease of use make this a particularly good platform for project management and general workflow management among teams. It also integrates with Slack, Trello, Google Drive, Dropbox, and others, so you can use it a central focal point for teams to work together. As above, these integrations mean that monday.com can be used to achieve a wider working remit than the standalone platform itself.\nWe've also featured the best small business software.\nBest online collaboration tool FAQs\nTips for choosing a suitable online collaboration tool\n1. Consider your budget and look for something that\u2019s affordable for your enterprise. If you\u2019re a large organization with a sizeable IT budget, you can go with a more expensive platform that\u2019ll give you access to sophisticated features that you may not even need much. In contrast, if you\u2019re a small business, it\u2019s wise to choose a plan that gives you just the basic collaboration features at a reasonable price.\n2. Customer support. Things can go wrong at any time, so choose a platform that offers customer support via email, live chat, or telephone. Check user reviews to see what other people are saying about your intended platform\u2019s support before making a final choice.\n3. Look for a platform with a user-friendly interface. This will make it easy for employees of your organization to collaborate instead of losing productivity trying to figure out how to use the software.\n4. Choose a platform with a strong security reputation to avoid leaks or theft of sensitive data.\n5. Pick a platform that has integrations with third-party tools for additional functionalities that you may need.\nWhich online collaboration tools is best for you?\nWhen deciding which online collaboration tool to use, first consider what actual needs you have. For example, someone simply wanting to work with a handful of people on a casual basis may find a cheaper option is the most cost-effective while providing all of the necessary tools that would be required. However, if you're planning to use online collaboration tools for professional or business purposes, especially with a large number of people and on a regular basis, then you will probably want to look to the higher-end options for the more advanced options that are included.\nHow we tested the best online collaboration tools\nTo test for the best online collaboration tools we searched for a range of popular options as well as took recommendations from people we know who use online collaboration tools regularly. We then tried each platform to see how user-friendly each was, as well as determine what range of tools and advanced options were available. Pricing also came into account when determining our best list.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best cloud computing provider of 2025\nVirtual IT infrastructure for Digital Transformation\nWe list the best cloud computing services, to make it simple and easy to manage your computing in the cloud to help with digital transformation.\nCloud services have revolutionized computing, not least through IaaS, PaaS, and especially SaaS, which have allowed businesses to develop virtualized IT infrastructure and deliver software through the cloud, independent of a user's operating system.\nEven better still, businesses can also mix and match cloud services from different providers to ensure maximum efficiency and cost effectiveness. For larger businesses especially the economic benefits can be significant.\nBecause cloud services are run through software platforms and virtualized networks, it means that it's easy to access and analyze data for the purposes of analytics as well as for business intelligence purposes. The result is IT infrastructure management that allows for insights that would have previously been much more difficult to access.\nCloud computing services also offer the advantage of being scalable, which means not only can you access additional resources exactly as you need them, but you are also charged only for the services you use so there's no need to buy in extra hardware for additional redundancy.\nThis especially applies to when storing data, as online cloud storage can be treated as effectively limitless. Even though you might be using cloud databases for your structured data, you can also archive everything else into massive data lakes for additional processing using AI and machine learning for greater insights.\nAltogether, cloud services offer unparalleled potential for improving business performance and increasing profits, and here we'll look at the best cloud computing service provider.\nKamatera cloud computing: Start free trial with $100 credit\nKamatera\u2019s cloud computing services offer scalable infrastructure, flexible pricing, and enterprise-grade reliability. With globally distributed data centers and always-on tech support from live humans, you can deploy, manage, and scale your cloud resources without paying for unnecessary features.\nThere are endless cloud computing services out there, and choosing the best one can be an uphill battle. It\u2019s essential to select an ideal one based on your requirements. Otherwise, you might find it strenuous to build and maintain your platform.\nThere are many things to consider including cost, pricing, security, features, ease of use, etc. We tested various cloud computing vendors and selected the best ones for you. Each one has its advantages and disadvantages but, overall, are some of the best cloud platforms you can find.\nWe've featured the best business cloud storage.\nThe best cloud computing service of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest cloud computing provider for reliability\n1. Amazon Web Services\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the world\u2019s biggest cloud computing provider. It kickstarted the cloud revolution and has occupied the number one spot for a long time.\nAWS has the largest data center network of all cloud providers, so it\u2019s very reliable and offers solid performance. You can host your application in the region where your customers are closest. For instance, if you\u2019re in the U.K. and observe that most of your customers come from the U.S., you can choose a U.S.-based data center to offer faster speed.\nAWS is known for being user-friendly. It's built for quick and easy access, and you can monitor or modify your data just when you want. This cloud platform offers a lot of web application services, so you have a broad choice of features to adopt. You can choose the best server operating system depending on which programming languages power your app.\nAWS is also known for being very safe and secure. The platform has had few noteworthy security incidents since its founding in 2006.\nHowever, there are some drawbacks. A common customer complaint is that AWS\u2019s billing system is confusing, leaving users prone to making mistakes that increase their costs. Another complaint is the high costs of dedicated support from AWS experts.\nBest cloud computing provider for scalability\n2. Microsoft Azure\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAzure is a cloud computing service offered by Microsoft, the American tech giant best known for its Windows operating system. It allows you to build and run your applications on the cloud with ease.\nAzure has a large network of over 200 data centers spread across the globe. This network guarantees high availability and redundancy, with Azure offering a service level agreement (SLA) of 99.95% (roughly 4.38 hours of downtime per year).\nAzure has invested a lot of resources into security. It offers built-in controls for detecting and thwarting cyber threats; it applies artificial intelligence and machine learning to aid this process. The company has a team of over 3,500 cybersecurity experts working to safeguard its cloud network.\nScalability shouldn't be a worry when using Azure. You can start with small computing resources and increase them as your business grows. The platform uses the pay-as-you-go method, making it cost-effective as you scale.\nBut a notable drawback of using Azure is its complex user interface. You\u2019ll likely find it more difficult to navigate Azure than AWS and some other rival platforms.\nTake a look at our Microsoft discount codes for the best Microsoft offers and savings.\nBest cloud computing provider for Google\n3. Google Cloud\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGoogle Cloud is an eponymous cloud computing service offered by Google, the tech company best known for its search engine. Google got into the cloud game later than most competitors but nonetheless has built a strong customer base.\nGoogle Cloud dedicates a lot of resources to security. It uses artificial intelligence and machine learning systems to detect and counter cyber threats. Users have access to a host of cybersecurity features to keep sensitive data secure.\nThis platform is famous for its high performance. Ask many customers the best thing about choosing Google Cloud, and you\u2019ll likely hear about performance. Google has a lot of hardware and software expertise that it leveraged to design servers and server management software that works as fast as possible.\nAnother good thing you\u2019ll hear about Google Cloud is that the platform makes it easy for multiple users to collaborate within the same interface and access the same features. This platform also offers comprehensive support resources, including tutorials, how-to articles, an online community, and human support.\nThe main complaint that you\u2019ll hear about Google Cloud is that it\u2019s expensive, which is true. It costs more to use Google Cloud than rival platforms like AWS and Azure, but many people think the tradeoff for high performance is worth it.\nBest cloud computing provider for enterprises\n4. IBM Cloud\nReasons to buy\nIBM Cloud is a cloud computing service offered by the eponymous tech giant IBM. The solution offers PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS.\nAs hardware and virtual-based servers are combined into one on demand cloud-platform, you have complete control. IBM refer to their hardware servers as \u2018bare metal\u2019. These provide clients with sole access to their entire server. This reduces the \u2018noisy neighbor\u2019 effect and greatly improves performance.\nIBM Cloud is integrated and managed by a single system that can be controlled via web portal, API (Application Programming Interface) or mobile apps. IBM Cloud\u2019s Bluemix developing solution has a wide range of cloud SaaS management tools.\nIBM Cloud also offers full server customization. This means that everything that is included in the server is handpicked by you. This way you do not have to pay for features that you might never use.\nBest distributed cloud computing provider\n5. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\nReasons to buy\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure offers two main service provisions available: cloud architecture, and storage data.\nCloud architecture includes data management, cloud databases, and applications, while the Oracle Data Cloud is primarily for driving big data analytics for business intelligence insights. Oracle also provides a range of SaaS platforms such as HCM, EPM, SCM, and social media tools.\nFor those who do sign up, aside from a 30-day free trial, Oracle Cloud also offers a free service tier which includes unlimited access to two autonomous databases which come with Oracle Application Express (APEX) and Oracle SQL.\nBest open source cloud computing OS\n6. CloudLinux\nReasons to buy\nCloudLinux isn't so much a cloud computing provider, but rather a cloud platform you can build across your own servers. This means that if you'd prefer to have tight control over your cloud network rather than going with third-parties, you can host it yourself. While this presents a different set of challenges, it also offers a range of benefits, especially for those companies already heavily invested in their own IT infrastructure.\nCloudLinux is a distro of specifically built for virtualized cloud operations to power shared hosting services, by allocating and limiting server resources to each tenant. Additionally, each tenant is partition from each other, in other to create a more secure environment. The result is a hosting platform that has built in redundancy, stability, and security, in order to provide a better hosting environment.\nAll cloud services require a degree of technical knowledge to work with, so for those with extensive expertise CloudLinux offers the opportunity to be far more in control of your own services and how they are configured.\nBest cloud computing provider for Europe\n7. OVHCloud\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOVHcloud is a French cloud computing provider focused on European customers. It is the largest cloud hosting provider in Europe and the third-largest globally based on physical servers.\nOVHcloud gives you access to virtual private servers or dedicated servers. You can choose the type you want and the region you want it to be in. Your choice depends on the type of online platform you're hosting, as some servers are faster than others.\nThis platform has the largest data center network in Europe, so it\u2019s an ideal choice if most of your customers are based in this region. Furthermore, OVHcloud is affordable compared to most rival platforms.\nWhen testing OVHcloud, we observed that its customer support wasn\u2019t as good as what you\u2019d get on rival platforms. You need to pay a significant sum for dedicated human support, which puts it at a disadvantage.\nBest cloud computing provider for cost-effectiveness\n8. DigitalOcean\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDigitalOcean is one of the most popular low-cost cloud providers. It doesn\u2019t offer as much sophisticated features as you\u2019d find on rival platforms like Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. It focuses more on offering simple cloud computing features for an affordable price and does its job well.\nDigitalOcean has 15 data centers worldwide, much smaller than the network of the likes of AWS and Azure. Its reliability and performance are good but not as good as what you\u2019d get on these rival platforms. The attraction of DigitalOcean is trading lower costs for fewer features and performance.\nIt's pretty easy to spin up cloud servers on DigitalOcean to host your application. The platform is easy to navigate, so you shouldn\u2019t face difficulties navigating it. You can choose different types of managed cloud databases, clusters, and APIs. You can also access complementary features such as security firewalls, load balances, and a DNS management system.\nBest cloud computing provider FAQs\nHow to choose a cloud computing provider\nCost\nCost is the number one consideration in selecting a provider. It\u2019s essential to pick something that you can afford to avoid running into trouble in the future. Cloud services are unique such that they don\u2019t usually have a straightforward pricing structure. What you\u2019ll pay depends on the features that you select. The good thing is that cloud services offer their pricing details beforehand so that you can have a good estimate of what you\u2019ll pay.\nSecurity\nYou\u2019ll be storing a lot of sensitive data on your cloud provider. Thus, it must have advanced security features to prevent data leaks or theft. Losing customer data can hamper your reputation and even bring about legal lawsuits. Similarly, losing sensitive business data can harm your competitive advantage, so your cloud platform must be secure.\nFeatures\nWhat features do the platform offer? Can you choose the type of servers you want? Can you spin up GPUs? Does it offer complementary services such as domain names and DNS management? Etc.\nEase of use\nYou need a platform that\u2019s easy to understand and navigate. Otherwise, you can get frustrated or make costly mistakes by choosing features you didn\u2019t intend to choose.\nWhat are the essential features of a cloud provider?\nOn-demand self-service\nYou should be able to spin up cloud instances and use them without external help. You should be able to monitor the servers you've rented and their allotted storage capacities. External help can always be a complementary feature, but the important thing is that every good cloud provider must offer a self-serve option.\nSolid uptime\nA cloud provider should have their servers up and running as faultlessly as possible. Of course, no platform is perfect, so you may experience occasional downtimes. However, every cloud provider should offer at least 99.9% uptime. Otherwise, you may lose money because of unnecessary server issues preventing your online platform from working.\nAnalytics\nAn ideal cloud computing platform should let users analyze what features they\u2019ve used and give them a breakdown of how it affects their costs. This way, a user can easily identify which features are generating high costs and which ones aren\u2019t, and use this information to optimize their spending.\nPay-As-You-Go\nPay-as-you-go is the best pricing structure because you only pay for the computing features you use. This way, you avoid paying for unnecessary things that you may not use, and you save significant sums in the long run.\nHow we tested the best cloud computing providers\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors. To start with, we look at the feature set, the range of tools available, and what range of business type and size the cloud computing service would be ideal for. We consider how easy the setup is, the simplicity of the interface, and whether there's sufficient documentation and tutorials for users to utilize necessary options optimally.\nWe assess how well the service integrates with other relevant services, such as security perimeters and user apps. We also looks at pricing models and flexibility, and lastly, we judge the quality of the customer service and the different pricing plans available.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "It\u2019s a scenario that plays out far too often: A mid-sized company runs a routine threat validation exercise and stumbles on something unexpected, like an old infostealer variant that has been quietly active in their network for weeks.\nThis scenario doesn\u2019t require a zero-day exploit or sophisticated malware. All it takes is one missed setting, inadequate endpoint oversight, or a user clicking what they shouldn\u2019t. Such attacks don\u2019t succeed because they\u2019re advanced. They succeed because routine safeguards aren\u2019t in place.\nTake Lumma Stealer, for example. This is a simple phishing attack that lures users into running a fake CAPTCHA script. It spreads quickly but can be stopped cold by something as routine as restricting PowerShell access and providing basic user training. However, in many environments, even those basic defenses aren\u2019t deployed.\nThis is the story behind many breaches today. Not headline-grabbing hacks or futuristic AI assaults\u2014just overlooked updates, fatigued teams and basic cyber hygiene falling through the cracks.\nVP of Adversary Research, Attackiq.\nSecurity Gaps That Shouldn\u2019t Exist in 2025\nSecurity leaders know the drill: patch the systems, limit access and train employees. Yet these essentials often get neglected. While the industry chases the latest exploits and talks up advanced tools, attackers keep targeting the same weak points. They don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel. They just need to find one that\u2019s loose.\nJust as the same old techniques are still at work, old malware is making a comeback. Variants like Mirai, Matsu and Klopp are resurfacing with minor updates and major impact. These aren\u2019t sophisticated campaigns, but recycled attacks retooled just enough to slip past tired defenses.\nThe reason they work isn\u2019t technical, it\u2019s operational. Security teams are burned out. They\u2019re managing too many alerts, juggling too many tools and doing it all with shrinking budgets and rising expectations. In this kind of environment, the basics don\u2019t just get deprioritized, they get lost.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nBurnout Is a Risk Factor\nThe cybersecurity industry often defines risk in terms of vulnerabilities, threat actors and tool coverage, but burnout may be the most overlooked risk of all. When analysts are overwhelmed, they miss routine maintenance. When processes are brittle, teams can\u2019t keep up with the volume. When bandwidth runs out, even critical tasks can get sidelined.\nThis isn\u2019t about laziness. It\u2019s about capacity. Most breaches don\u2019t reveal a lack of intelligence. They just demonstrate a lack of time.\nMeanwhile, phishing campaigns are growing more sophisticated. Generative AI is making it easier for attackers to craft personalized lures. Infostealers continue to evolve, disguising themselves as login portals or trusted interfaces that lure users into running malicious code. Users often infect themselves, unknowingly handing over credentials or executing code.\nThese attacks still rely on the same assumptions: someone will click. The system will let it run. And no one will notice until it\u2019s too late.\nWhy Real-World Readiness Matters More Than Tools\nIt\u2019s easy to think readiness means buying new software or hiring a red team, but true preparedness is quieter and more disciplined. It\u2019s about confirming that defenses such as access restrictions, endpoint rules and user permissions are working against the actual threats.\nAchieving this level of preparedness takes more than monitoring generic threat feeds. Knowing that ransomware is trending globally isn\u2019t the same as knowing which threat groups are actively scanning your infrastructure. That\u2019s the difference between a broader weather forecast and radar focused on your ZIP code.\nOrganizations that regularly validate controls against real-world, environment-specific threats gain three key advantages.\nFirst, they catch problems early. Second, they build confidence across their team. When everyone knows what to expect and how to respond, fatigue gives way to clarity. Thirdly, by knowing the threats that matter, and the ones focused on them, they can prioritize those fundamental activities that get ignored.\nYou may not need to patch every CVE right now, just the ones being used by the threat actors targeting you. What areas of your network are they actively doing reconnaissance on? Those subnets probably need more focus to patching and remediation.\nSecurity Doesn\u2019t Need to Be Sexy, It Needs to Work\nThere\u2019s a cultural bias in cybersecurity toward innovation and incident response. The new tool, the emergency patch and the major breach all get more attention than the daily habits that quietly prevent problems.\nReal resilience depends on consistency. It means users can\u2019t run untrusted PowerShell scripts. It means patches are applied on a prioritized schedule, not \u201cwhen we get around to it.\u201d It means phishing training isn\u2019t just a checkbox, but a habit reinforced over time.\nThese basics aren\u2019t glamorous, but they work. In an environment where attackers are looking for the easiest way in, doing the simplest things correctly is one of the most effective strategies a team can take.\nDiscipline Is the New Innovation\nThe cybersecurity landscape will continue to change. AI will keep evolving, adversaries will go on adapting, and the next headline breach is likely already in motion. The best defense isn\u2019t more noise or more tech, but better discipline.\nSecurity teams don\u2019t need to do everything. They need to do the right things consistently. That starts with reestablishing routine discipline: patch, configure, test, rinse and repeat. When those fundamentals are strong, the rest can hold.\nFor CISOs, now is the time to ask a simple but powerful question: Are we doing the basics well, and can we prove it? Start by assessing your organization\u2019s hygiene baseline. What patches are overdue? What controls haven\u2019t been tested in months? Where are your people stretched too thin to execute the essentials? The answers won\u2019t just highlight the risks, they\u2019ll point toward the pathway to resilience.\nWe list the best patch management software.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best patch management software of 2025\nDon't fall behind on software updates\nWe list the best patch management software, to make it simple and easy to maintain and schedule updates for applications on your PC or IT network.\nWith new software vulnerabilities and exploits appearing daily, it's vital to install Windows and application security patches just as soon as they're released. Unfortunately, that's not always easy.\nThe standard approach to patch management lets every app handle its own updates. You must make sure the apps are set up correctly, and allow them to run any necessary updates. However, sometimes software updaters end up disabled in order to improve computer performance.\nA dedicated patch manager replaces this chaos with a single central interface to scan multiple apps for updates, report any missing patches it finds, and (sometimes) automatically rectify the situation.\nThe simplest of these tools work as little more than PC update reminders. They'll warn you when new patches appear, and you then sort out any updates yourself. Sometimes that's a minor hassle, but in some instances it takes mere seconds (in Chrome, click Help > About > Update and the browser sorts out everything else).\nThe most powerful enterprise-level patch managers can scan systems on your network (often across multiple platforms), detect missing patches (both third-party apps and operating system updates), remotely install them on your preferred schedule, and even roll back any updates if there are problems.\nThis technology has risks, as well as advantages. If a poorly configured patch manager downloads the wrong update file, for instance, it might break your application, or even affect your entire PC. It's important to choose your manager carefully, and ensure you know how to cope if anything goes wrong.\nHere we'll feature the best patch management software platforms currently available on the market.\nReader offer: Get a 14-day free trial on NinjaOne\nNinjaOne is a cloud-based IT management platform designed for IT professionals. It offers features like remote monitoring, patch management, asset tracking, and automated remediation, enabling efficient device management across various environments. With capabilities such as secure remote access, real-time alerts, and mobile device management, NinjaOne streamlines IT operations.\nWe've also featured the best endpoint protection software.\nThe best patch management software of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest patch management software overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNinjaOne is a popular RMM and endpoint management solution that\u2019s been in the business for over 10 years. It has excellent patch management functions available for Windows, Mac, and Linux servers, workstations, and laptops, all managed from a single, centralized, user-friendly platform. It was even named as the number one patch management tool in the G2 Spring 2024 report.\nNinjaOne utilizes a cloud-native approach for patch management, allowing users to receive updates without needing to be connected to the company's network or VPN. NinjaOne supports automatic patching for over 140 widely used applications, and the platform offers an intuitive dashboard and detailed patch status reports, enabling you to monitor compliance status at any time.\nRegarding customer service, NinjaOne is outstanding, with an average response time of 65 minutes and a customer satisfaction score of 98. Also, you get free customer onboarding services, which include technical advice, making the initial setup and troubleshooting process smooth and effortless.\nPricing is a bit tricky as the company doesn\u2019t show it on its website. Instead, you\u2019ll have to contact the sales department team and request a quote. Still, after some research,we found you can expect to spend anywhere between $2-4 per endpoint. In addition, there\u2019s also a free trial which you can use to test out the product.\nRead our full NinjaOne review.\nBest patch management software for ease of use\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSecurity vendor Avast has interesting software update tools covering three levels of user.\nBargain hunters and beginners can install Avast Free Antivirus to get its basic Software Updater. This scans for missing patches, includes a 'What's changed?' link (where possible) to explain what's in an update, and can download and silently install your chosen updates with a click.\nAvast's Premier and Ultimate security suites add the ability to automatically install updates as they're detected.\nTop of the range, though, is Avast Business Patch Management. Deploy this with one of Avast's managed antivirus products (Antivirus, Antivirus Pro, Antivirus Pro Plus) across your network, and it allows you to check the update status for a vast range of Windows apps from 100 top vendors: Adobe, Google, Microsoft (Windows and applications), Mozilla, Piriform, WinZip and more.\nAvast says there's support for thousands of applications, but keep in mind that as with many competitors, this includes multiple versions. Firefox is counted 72 times, for instance. For a more realistic view of the total, take a look at this PDF of the full application list.\nYou get vast control over how and when the scan and patching process works. Instead of being forced to scan your entire network at the same time, you're able to set up special rules for each device, or define particular apps or vendors you'd like to exclude. You can choose when to deploy patches (immediately, on a schedule, manually) and decide what should happen afterwards (ask the user, request or even force a reboot).\nComprehensive reports help you see exactly what's going on across your network, covering everything from the most patched applications to details on patches which haven't deployed (important information if the same update is regularly failing across your network).\nThere's no minimum number of devices, making the package suitable for any small business, or maybe even a home network. And if any of this sounds interesting, a free trial gives you 30 days to find out more.\nRead our full Avast Business Patch Management review.\nBest quick patch management software\n3. Avira Software Updater\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAvira Software Updater is a simple patch manager which helps you spot the latest updates for more than 150 popular applications.\nAvira doesn't provide a full list of its supported applications, unfortunately, but it seems to include Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash, CCleaner and more.\nSoftware Updater can also scan for out-of-date drivers, but we wouldn't recommend that. You're unlikely to see any major benefits (drivers rarely get significant security patches that Windows won't handle itself), and a failed or poorly chosen driver update can seriously mess up your PC. Leave driver updates to Windows, it's much safer.\nThe free version of Software Updater (available standalone, there is no need to install Avira Antivirus) scans your system on launch, displays missing patches, and \u2013 that's it. There's no automatic update option, no scheduling or anything else. Clicking a globe icon should take you to the developer's product page, so you can download it yourself, but even that doesn't always work as you expect.\nThe Google Chrome download link took us to Google.de, for instance, Google's German language site. That's not a big deal \u2013 Google automatically translated it for us, and the download would still have worked \u2013 but it's an example of how a software updater may use update links and files that you wouldn't see normally.\nThis won't be an issue for everyone. Arguably the safest way to use any software updater is to get reminders of any missing patches, but then to find and install them yourself. Your software stays current, and you don't risk problems caused by the updater using the wrong patch or not installing it properly.\nIf automatic updates are a must, Avira's Software Updater Pro is available on the annual plan. It supports Windows updates, too, and includes unlimited customer support via a toll-free number and email.\nBest comprehensive patch management software\n4. GFI LanGuard\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGFI LanGuard is a comprehensive patch manager for businesses, or anyone with 10 or more systems to protect.\nThe tool is designed to cover your entire network, and can handle updates for multiple operating systems, including Windows 7-10, Windows Server 2003-2012, along with Mac and assorted Linux distros.\nIf you prefer to leave your OS to handle its own updates, that could be wise, but GFI LanGuard also supports more than 80 third-party apps.\nAlthough we're mostly interested in patch management, GFI LanGuard also includes industrial-strength network auditing and vulnerability scans. Reports might highlight issues with installed applications, your security tools, mobile devices connecting to your network, open ports, file shares, and more.\nStart to install GFI LanGuard and it's immediately obvious that this isn't a product for beginners. It prompted us to install SQL server, then a web server, and even when it was running, it took us a while to find out how to do as much as run a scan.\nHowever, put in the effort and you'll get some very impressive results. Items are organized into lists of missing security updates, non-security updates and Windows service packs and update rollups. You can also view recently installed updates, a handy way to see that all is well. All updates have descriptions, notes on severity, and even a link to the developer's website where you can find out more.\nYou can opt to update some or all missing patches, either immediately or at a specific time. If you're deploying patches to another computer on your network, you can choose to warn the user beforehand, as well as what happens afterwards (do nothing, shut down, reboot and so on).\nA free 30-day trial provides a risk-free way to explore what's on offer. Beware, though, that's not as generous as it sounds: GFI LanGuard comes so crammed with functionality you'll probably wish the test period was longer.\nBest patch management software for enterprises\n5. ManageEngine Patch Manager Plus\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nManageEngine Patch Manager Plus is a very powerful tool for deploying patches across Windows, Mac and Linux systems.\nPatch Manager Plus updates operating systems, Microsoft Office and a host of Office components, and a decent list of third-party apps, too. Although it's very business-oriented, there's a good range of apps that any experienced home user might have on their PC: 7Zip, Adobe Reader, CCleaner, Chrome, FileZilla, Firefox, IrfanView, Opera, Recuva, RoboForm, and more (check out the full list here \u2013 350+ apps are supported in total).\nThis isn't some basic software updater where you have to manually check for or initiate updates. Everything can be automated, from checking local systems for missing updates, to downloading as required, deploying updates, and sending you detailed reports on progress.\nThe entire process is highly configurable. You're able to schedule scanning by time, group or some custom collection of devices, for instance, then deploy in your preferred time window and with per-device custom actions (display alerts, reboot and so on).\nThis flexibility has all kinds of advantages. If you're managing a large number of devices in a business, for instance, you can deploy critical patches to a small test group of PCs first, and wait for them to be approved as safe (another process you can automate) before rolling them out across the company.\nAlthough Patch Manager Plus isn't exactly difficult to use, the sheer weight of features means you've plenty to learn before you'll be able to find your way around. It's well worth a look for demanding users, though, especially as a Free Edition enables protecting up to 20 computers and 5 servers.\nIf that's not enough, commercial plans are reasonably priced. For example, Patch Manager Plus supports up to 50 computers, and adds extras like support for a distribution server to serve patches from your local network (so there is no need for every device to download them separately).\nBest patch management software for experts\n6. Chocolatey\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nChocolatey is a comprehensive package manager for Windows which can automate installing, updating and uninstalling all your software.\nThis isn't a tool for newbies. Chocolatey makes heavy use of PowerShell and is run from the command line, rather than a graphical interface, so you'll need some knowledge and experience to get the most from the product. But if you're willing to spend some time learning the basics, don't necessarily let that put you off.\nThere's nothing difficult about Chocolatey's basic commands, for instance. Here are three examples:\n- choco install firefox\n- choco upgrade firefox\n- choco uninstall firefox\nIt's very obvious what they're going to do, and now you've got the basic idea, you can probably figure out how to do the same with a host of other apps (for example, just replace 'firefox' with 'googlechrome', 'adobereader' or whatever other app you need).\nChocolatey works its magic with 'packages', PowerShell files which automate the install, upgrade and uninstall tasks for each app. Users can create packages for their own use or share them with others, and as a result of this flexibility, Chocolatey now supports more than 7,000 apps.\nAlthough Chocolatey doesn't have the built-in automation options of specialist patch management tools, you can get a lot done with some very simple scripts. The single command 'choco upgrade all' will upgrade all installed apps, for instance; just run that when your device boots, maybe as a scheduled task, and the system will automatically keep itself updated.\nChocolatey is available for free in its very capable open source form. Commercial plans add all kinds of handy package-building options, reporting features and other enhancements specifically for business use.\nBest free patch management software for simplicity\n7. Ninite\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNinite is a simple tool for installing and updating a lot of Windows apps at once.\nThe service stands out for its streamlined, web-based interface and its automated installers. If you decide you need to install or update Chrome, Firefox and Opera on a PC, for instance, this is all you need to do: go to Ninite.com; check the box for each browser; click Download to download a custom installer, and run it to install or update the browsers.\nThat's it. Really, it's that simple. No need to register, create an account, hand over your email address \u2013 there aren't even any ads. You'll be done in 30 seconds, maybe less.\nIt's not all good news. Although Ninite supports 90+ apps, and some big names among them \u2013 the main browsers, Skype, various free antivirus (Avast, AVG, Avira), iTunes, .NET, Java, Google Earth, Steam \u2013 it's mostly focused on open source and freeware projects. If you're looking for a PDF viewer, for instance, there's no Adobe Reader; instead you get Foxit Reader, maybe SumatraPDF or CutePDF.\nThe free Ninite only has the most basic features, too. Once you have your installer, you can share it with others, then run it to install your chosen apps, or update any that are missing patches. But there's no automation, no scheduling, no reports or anything else.\nNinite probably works best as an easy way to install your favorite apps on a new PC. You can equip your new hardware with Chrome, Steam, 7-Zip, IrfanView, Paint.NET, Google Earth and more in a fraction of the time it would take if you installed them manually.\nNinite's simple updating is worth a try as well, though, and businesses who need more can check out Ninite Pro. Install the Pro agent on each system and they show up on your web management interface, with all their installed app details, and you can update them manually or automatically with a range of configuration options.\nNinite Pro still can't match the vast power of tools like GFI LanGuard, but that's reflected in the price.\nBest free patch management tools\nBest free patch management software\n1. Patch My PC Home Updater\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPatch My PC Home Updater is a free Windows program which can help you monitor over 300 popular apps, automatically detecting any updates and (optionally) silently downloading and installing any patches it finds.\nThe '300 apps' figure is boosted a little by the inclusion of products which are obscure, obsolete or both (Bitdefender Anti-Ransomware, Imgburn, Microsoft EMET \u2013 the full list is here). But it's still better than many competitors, especially for a free product, and geeks will appreciate some of the more technical apps it supports: Angry IP Scanner, Atom, Brackets, GIMP, Sysinternals Suite, and more.\nUnusually, Patch My PC doesn't require installation, or ask you to hand over your email address or other personal details. Launch it, the program detects your installed apps (and portable versions) and displays up-to-date products in green, or any which are missing patches in red.\nPatch My PC's interface is a little cluttered, and doesn't always work as you might expect. Its scan report doesn't give you a table of results you can work with individually, for instance (update these two immediately, ignore that for now, don't check these apps in future, say). The results are plain text only, and you can't do anything but look at them.\nIf you're more interested in speed and automation, though, the program works very well. You can have it install all missing patches with a click, for example. And a well-designed scheduler enables automatically checking for updates at your preferred time and frequency, with the option to run it again later if a check is missed (because your PC was turned off, say).\nPatch My PC also works well as a simple application manager. It's easy to create a custom list of your ten favorite apps, say, and have the program set them all up for you on a new PC. And a built-in Uninstaller lets you remove multiple apps in a single operation.\nAn interesting range of bonus options includes the ability to cache updates in a local folder. If you're running Patch My PC on a USB key, for instance, it will save new updates to a local folder. Plug the key into other PCs, and if they need the same update, they'll use the cached copy rather than download it again.\nBest general patch management software\n2. Heimdal Free\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nHeimdal Free is the software updating module from Heimdal Security's commercial range of security suites. As the name would suggest, it\u2019s free to download and use.\nAs we write, the package supports updating around 100 apps (or around 60, if we exclude those with multiple versions). The full list is available on the website.\nHeimdal Free has the same interface as Heimdal's full-strength suites, making it a little bulkier than most of the competition. Our opening screen had four greyed-out areas with 'Upgrade' messages, for instance, and one button which led to the actual updating module, which Thor calls 'X-Ploit Resilience.'\nEven the main Heimdal Free module isn't as straightforward as usual. There's no Scan button, and we had to check a 'Monitor' option before Heimdal Free looked for updates. And once you get the report, all you can do is tell Heimdal Free to automatically update that package in future, or leave it up to you.\nThere's not a lot of power or configurability here, then, but the few features you do get seem to work very well. Once we checked the Monitor and AutoUpdate boxes for our chosen apps, Heimdal Free automatically detected updates, downloaded and silently installed them in the background, without hassling us in any way.\nBest open source patch management software\n3. Npackd\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNpackd is an interesting open source application store for Windows which can help you find, install, update and uninstall a host of popular apps.\nThe package supports an impressive 1,469 apps at the time of writing. That's not quite as good as it sounds, because many apps count at least twice for 32-bit and 64-bit downloads, plus many are low-level runtimes rather than applications you actually want to install (there are 13 downloads supporting 'WinRT Intellisense', for instance). Still, even if we ruled out all of those, there's a lot more here than you'll see with most of the competition.\nLaunch Npackd and its full catalog appears in a simple table, along with the current version of all apps, and whatever version you have installed. It's a very long list, but fortunately you can filter it by category (Music, Productivity, Security and so on) or by entering part of an app name in the Search box.\nSelect one or more apps and you can have Npackd silently install (or uninstall) them all in a couple of clicks. Choose the 'Updateable' category and Npackd displays every supported app you've installed with a missing patch. Again, select them all, tap Install, and Npackd will quickly run its update tasks.\nWe noticed some technical and interface oddities. Npackd didn't seem able to detect the currently available version for quite a few apps, for instance, which presumably will make it impossible to safely update them. Some apps didn't properly install for us, either, although the package does at least provide quite a few ways to address this. (You can look at the commands used during the installation, for instance, or open the app website directly to check version numbers.)\nThe interface doesn't directly enable automating, scheduling or otherwise managing your updates, either. Although there's a lot you can do \u2013 add support for custom apps, for instance, or manage tasks from the command line or scripts \u2013 you'll need some Windows experience to get the most out of the system.\nStill, overall it's a capable product, and well worth a look for more demanding users.\nBest automated free patch management software\n4. RuckZuck\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRuckZuck is a free and very easy to use software package manager for Windows. And it really is seriously easy to get to grips with. You don't have to install anything or create an account, for instance. Just download and run the portable version and you're ready to go.\nThe interface is extremely simple. Launch RuckZuck, and after a few seconds it tells you how many updates, if any, are available for your installed apps. Click that button and RuckZuck lists them all, highlighting the current and latest version numbers. Clicking Update All silently updates everything on the list, or you can select one or more apps and update only those.\nIf you think that sounds basic, you'd be right, but RuckZuck has more to offer. A command line tool enables automating updates from your own scripts, for instance. Installing RuckZuck's OneGet Provider gives you custom software updating PowerShell commands, and enterprise users can even get integration with Microsoft's System Center Configuration Manager.\nRuckZuck's software catalog looks impressive, too, with hundreds of apps supported: 540 at the latest count. It's not quite as good as it seems \u2013 there are a lot of open source and freeware projects you may not even recognize, let alone use \u2013 but you'll find plenty of popular apps, too: 7-Zip, .NET, Adobe Reader, Chrome, CCleaner, FileZilla, Firefox, IrfanView, iTunes and more.\nOur main reservation is that RuckZuck is a small project \u2013 and entirely free to use \u2013 so doesn't have the people or resources behind it that you'll see with the bigger names. That's not really a criticism \u2013 it's a huge achievement that RuckZuck does so well \u2013 but inevitably means it can't possibly have as much testing or as many updates as the well-funded competition. And although the developer is very responsive, generally identifying and fixing problems within a day or two, he can't possibly replace the professional support team you'd get with a commercial service.\nExperienced users should check out RuckZuck anyway, as it's a likeable tool with a lot to offer. But if you're a business user, looking for maximum reliability and guaranteed speedy support if anything goes wrong, you'll probably be better off elsewhere.\nWe've also featured the best network monitoring tools.\nBest patch management software FAQs\nWhich patch management software is best for you?\nWhen deciding which patch management software to use, first consider what your actual needs are, as budget software may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a more expensive platform is much more worthwhile.

Add in the ability to manage records, ensure compliance and cover payroll duties and you have many business bases covered.\nThis cloud-based package does need to be tailored to fit your business, which means there are no off-the-shelf pricing options available.

It features three different variations on the theme, starting with Essentials which features HR, time and scheduling, integrations and a mobile app as part of the package.\nThe packages do have a minimum of 5 employees requirement however. If your business has less, you\u2019ll still effectively be paying for at least 5. No matter, as Zenefits delivers the goods with its next option, the Growth package, which includes core HR, time and scheduling, integrations and a mobile app. On top of that there are compensation management and performance management tools.\nMeanwhile, a Zen package rounds it out, and features all of the elements of the Growth bundle plus Wellbeing tools and the option for carrying out employee engagement surveys. Of course, Zenefits revolves around its powerful HR tools, from general administration through to onboarding and performance reviews.\nThe useful thing is that the HR data can also be used to tackle benefits options for employees and can be used to cover payroll, which is now an included part of the package. On top of that there are additional advisory services, which gets you unlimited access to a team of HR and payroll experts.\nHowever, there is an additional cost per employee for this. Another cost option is the ability to carry out benefits administration using your own broker. In addition, the payroll aspect comes with reporting tools plus tax and filing assistance.\nRead our full Zenefits review.\nZenefits - Plans to suit all budgets\nZenefits has a great selection of packages including Zen at just $21 down from $27 per month per employee, Growth at $18 down to just $14 per month per employee or the super value Essentials at $8 per month per employee, down from $10.

If you're in business and have employees you'll also need software to help handle HR requirements. There are payroll software packages that make this possible, all from within one interface. Others let you tackle numerous admin chores too, all within the confines of one bundle.\nHere's our selection of other best payroll software packages worth considering.\nSquare Payroll - basic but practical\nWhile it may not bristle with quite as many bells and whistles as some of its payroll counterparts, Square Payroll is mighty handy.

Get started for free.\nSurePayroll - Great all rounder\nSmall business users with reasonably modest needs will find the power and potential behind SurePayroll ideal. It offers quick and easy payroll processing, but it's also useful for handling and managing company data.

This software simplifies otherwise arduous processes, like managing employee salaries, wages, and deductions, and it integrates with existing HR or accounting systems.\nPayroll software essentials\nPayroll software is essential for any business with employees. However, it's not simply a case of ensuring taxes and benefits are properly managed, but also that employees are provided with clear information about their wages as well as necessary deductions.\nIt used to be the case that payroll software was downloaded and run from the office, with payslips printed out for employees to reference. Now though, cloud-based payroll systems allow not just for better redundancy and backups, but also digital record keeping. The software can provide payslips that employees can access from home or even on their phone, which ultimately saves on printing and paper too.\nAdditionally, this digital transformation also makes it easier for employees to submit queries, and support can be better centralized for it.\nHowever, whichever form of payroll software you choose to work with, it's imperative that it also runs smoothly with existing accounting packages. Therefore, don't be surprised to find the best payroll software also tends to be supplied by the suppliers who offer the best in accounting software too.\nHow to choose the best payroll software?\nIn order to compile our best payroll software list, we tried all of the software options available over a period of time. This allowed us to evaluate all of the features and functions designed to help small and medium-sized business work more efficiently.\nIf you run a business and have employees then a good quality, robust payroll package is invaluable for letting you get the task completed. Processing payroll doesn't just involve producing checks and direct deposits either because you'll want to have a payroll system that can help you with calculating taxes correctly and staying on top of other accounting chores.\nQuite how many features and functions you'll need from your payroll software largely depends on how big your business is. While larger brands such as Sage and QuickBooks can often be easily scaled up as you need more functionality, it may be an idea to stick with a smaller scale, slightly cheaper option. After all, there's no point in paying for the best payroll software if it contains more features than you actually need.\nHow we tested the best payroll software in the UK\nWe look for a solid collection of features and functions when we test the best payroll software for small business. That means we're on the lookout for unlimited payroll runs, options for administrative and employee access, plus cover for things like health benefits and workers comp.\nGiven that payroll software can frequently have its complicated aspects we always make a point of checking the customer support side too. This should ideally include phone, email and chat options, supplemented by plenty of documentation and training where possible.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

Unfortunately, this comes at the cost of your site using a Wix domain.\n\u2705 You want a platform that\u2019s easy to use: Wix\u2019s beginner-friendly approach renders it really easy to use, especially if you tap into its AI-powered tool, Wix ADI.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want to pay over the odds for ecommerce: Although there\u2019s a free plan, this doesn\u2019t offer ecommerce tools; only the most premium options have ecommerce tools.\n\u274c You\u2019re a big business: Larger sites might not find Wix as useful as smaller ventures given Wix doesn\u2019t provide unlimited resources with any of its plans.\n\u274c You\u2019re constantly experimenting with your site\u2019s look: Wix\u2019s templates are useful, but you can swap them out for another once it\u2019s set. If you want to change template, you\u2019ll have to build your site again from scratch.\n\ud83c\udf10 Wix is one of the best site builders and worth checking out, despite the fact it\u2019s not perfect. It has something for everyone \u2013 whether you\u2019re launching a blog or a professional site to promote your business, but larger sites may wish to look elsewhere. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nWhat you need to know:\nWix is one of the best best all-in-one ecommerce platforms on the marker that\u2019ll equip you with everything you\u2019ll ever need to build a beautiful online store. It comes in the package with a web hosting service and a domain name, free or paid.\nWe found the ecommerce features on Wix simple and easy to use. Its simplicity makes it an ideal option for small businesses that want to quickly and easily upload products and start selling online.\nAlthough we didn't set up a large scale ecommerce store, it is clear Wix's limited resources may prove an issue in these circumstances. If you want a platform with fewer limits, BigCommerce is worth checking out.\nPlans and pricing:\nAlthough Wix offers one of the best free website builder plans and a low cost \u2018Light\u2019 plan ($17/mo), if you want to sell online you will need to opt for one of its more advanced plans.\nThe cheapest plan that will allow you to sell online is the \u2018Core\u2019 plan ($29/mo). This gives you all the basics you need to build your website along with ecommerce tools such as the ability to sell up to 50,000 products, accept online payments, send abandoned cart emails, and apply automatic discounts.\nTaking a step up to the \u2018Business\u2019 plan ($36/mo) will give you everything from the \u2018Core\u2019 plan along with unlocking reviews, advanced shipping options, and up to 5 additional currencies.\nBusiness Elite ($159/mo) takes this one step further, adding a loyalty program along with more advanced versions of many of the tools you get with the lower level plans.\nWix is a great option for building an ecommerce store, but it certainly isn't the cheapest. In our Wix vs Weebly study, we found that although Wix offers better ecommerce and website builder features, Weebly is a strong competitor and costs considerably less, with premium packages starting at just $10/mo.\nEase of use:\nBoasting its beginner-friendly approach, Wix is one of the easiest site builders to use, particularly if you don\u2019t mind putting your trust in its AI-powered tool Wix ADI. In a matter of minutes, Wix ADI will build a site for you, though a basic one. So, you\u2019ll still want to utilize the editor and touch up your newly created site.\nFeatures:\nWix offers a cloud hosting service and a domain name with its packages. All plans come with a free SSL certificate and bandwidth is unlimited on most plans too, but storage space is sadly capped on all packages. Its ecommerce features, available with Business Basic on upwards, cover all core functionality you\u2019d expect. Wix allows you to accept online bookings for appointments, schedule online services, manage your staff, stream videos, and much more.\nWix offers one of the best AI website builders on the market. Simply explain the online store you are looking to build and the AI will deliver a dedicated template complete with text and image. Of course, this requires some editing, but is sure to help you get your store online in no time at all. Alternatively, you can pick from one of Wix's templates and build your store out from there.\nAI is also integrated across the rest of the Wix platform including everything from an AI text writer to AI image editing - both of which are super helpful for online stores that are looking to upload a high volume of products.\nThe Wix App Market can also add extra features and functionality to your site, with more than 500 apps on offer.This is alongside the Wix Ascend all-in-one business solution for website owners, which includes tools like email marketing, branding and SEO.\nSecurity:\nKeeping your website secure is critical, and Wix makes it simple by handling the technical stuff for you. Every Wix site comes with an SSL certificate, ensuring your visitors can browse safely with an encrypted connection. Additionally, Wix is PCI DSS compliant, which means it securely handles credit card payments, a must for any serious online store.\nWix boosts account protection by offering two-step verification, which means you'll need to enter a special code along with your username and password to access your account. You can receive this code via email, SMS, or an authenticator app, adding flexibility and extra security. Plus, the Login History page also lets you monitor account logins, locations, and dates, helping you spot any suspicious activity.\nFor business sites, Wix\u2019s collaboration tool can be a lifesaver. It lets you share access with team members securely, assigning specific roles so they only have access to what they need. Plus, Wix has built-in DDoS protection, monitors your site round-the-clock, and keeps a history of your site versions, so you can easily revert to a previous version if something goes wrong.\nSupport:\nWix provides a 24/7 callback service and live chat support from Monday to Friday, 2 AM - 6 PM (ET). In addition to English, live chat is also available in ten other languages including French, German, and Italian. Wix Help Center offers lots of step-by-step guides you can browse via categories, or a search box \u2013 which we prefer.\nRead the full review: Wix review\nFind the best deals on Wix products with our Wix promo codes.\nThe best ecommerce platform for WordPress\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You\u2019re looking to make the most of templates: Bluehost makes it easy for people to build a website with a plethora of templates and media sources, with prebuilt designs for different components that make up the site.\n\u2705 You need performance guaranteed: We reported no outages during testing, and response times averaged 1.95ms, which is incredibly fast, given most providers average between 200-400ms.\n\u2705 You want to build a WordPress site: WordPress recommends Bluehost becaue of its customer service and expertise, and the platform has offered plans optimized for WordPress since 2014.\n\u274c You need an email account: Although there are great advantages to using Bluehost, you can\u2019t buy an email address with its various packages.\n\u274c You want to pay monthly: There\u2019s no monthly payment option for Bluehost\u2019s website building plans, and you have the option to commit to 12 months or 36 months.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for a novice-friendly eccomerce platform: Like most open-source solutions, WooCommerce isn\u2019t the most beginner-friendly and it isn\u2019t included in the base plan.\n\ud83c\udf10 Bluehost + WooCommerce work together extremely well to give you an ecommerce solution optimised for WordPress. You get complete control over your site and plenty of templates to help you get underway, alongside a great variety of ecommerce tools. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nWhat you need to know:\nInstead of being a standalone ecommerce platform, WooCommerce is a free plugin that can turn your WordPress site into a fully functional online store. Like most open-source solutions, WooCommerce isn\u2019t the most novice-friendly option around.\nFortunately, Bluehost simplifies the process by providing a ready-made WooCommerce platform with everything you need already installed, and that includes a shopping theme and essential plugins.\nAlthough building an online store on WordPress can be a little daunting, we found it pretty easy when using Bluehost. However, if you are a complete novice, another option (such as Wix) may make more sense. Even with our background in testing and using website builders, we found some elements of setting up and using the WordPress platform for online selling a little confusing.\nPlans and pricing:\nBluehost offers three plans for its website builder. The Basic plan is intended for personal websites and blogs, while the others are aimed at businesses and store owners. Priced at $2.95 per month, for a 12-month subscription, the Basic Plan renews at $10.99 per month. If you want to deploy an online store, you must choose between the Pro and Online Store plans. The Pro plan is priced at $9.95 per month, for a 12-month subscription and renews at $14.99 per month. The Online Store will similarly cost you $24.99 per month, and renews at $39.95 per month.\nEase of use:\nBluehost provides an easy to use, intuitive drag-and-drop builder that can help you assemble a website, as well as tweak it\u2019s appearance and add different elements in almost no time at all. The custom-built WooCommerce platform, integrated into Bluehost, also makes it as easy as possible to tap into the features that make WooCommerce so powerful.\nFeatures:\nAll packages include a bevy of useful hosting essentials such as free SSL and domain name, albeit for the first year only. Hosting is included, too. The basic plan also includes free CDM, alongside 50GB SSD storage space.\nThe Bluehost Website Builder is built on top of WordPress, and serves to provide a more streamlined and straightforward interface for building websites using WordPress. Novice users will appreciate the drag-and-drop online store builder which lets you assemble robust ecommerce websites without any technical know-how, coding skills, or even familiarity with WordPress.\nBluehost also now offers a full AI website builder. This tool can help you quickly build and populate a dedicated online store, helping you start selling and growing your ecommerce business faster than ever before.\nSecurity:\nBluehost provides solid security, starting with a free SSL certificate on every plan. For sites handling serious amounts of sensitive information, a premium SSL certificate is available for $49.99 per year.\nBluehost includes free security tools like Spam Assassin protection, hotlink protection, and Secure Shell access. While these cover core security needs, additional measures like SiteLock Find, which offers advanced security for ecommerce sites, can be added for $1.99/month (billed annually). These enhancements are essential for protecting an online business.\nUnfortunately, PCI compliance is not automatically supported on all Bluehost accounts. Shared hosting requires a full CDN solution like Cloudflare to achieve PCI compliance, while VPS and dedicated server customers can reach compliance through a PCI scan. Also, although the core WooCommerce plugin isn't PCI-DSS certified, it's built with security in mind, and achieving PCI compliance is seen as the store owner's responsibility.\nSupport:\nWhile our experience with billing and the customer support was satisfactory, a quick look at Trustpilot reveals a different story. At present, Bluehost scores a rating of 3.2 out of 5. Most of the reviews are from dissatisfied customers expressing frustration at their interaction with the technical support and questions about billing.\nBluehost used to offer a ticket-based support system but that\u2019s been discontinued. Your only options are phone support, live chat, or scavenging for a solution on the Knowledge Base. There\u2019s also a Knowledge Base with guides split across eight broad categories \u2013 with all guides including step-by-step instructions.\nRead the full review: Bluehost Website Builder review\nCheck out our Bluehost promo codes to save money on your purchase.\nThe best ecommerce software without limits\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want no limits: Shopify doesn\u2019t include nearly as many annoying limits or catches as you\u2019ll get with other platforms, including unlimited product, bandwidth and disk space \u2013 alongside a free SSL certificate.\n\u2705 You want a broad choice of extensions: The template-style builder is complemented with a rich variety of integrations and other apps, including shipping and inventory management.\n\u2705 You need advanced analytics: Shopify\u2019s built-in analytics offers an at-a-glance view of important business stats, with individual reports giving you more detail.\n\u274c You want to avoid paying a premium: Shopify\u2019s various plans, while rich with tools and features, are on the pricy side, with the most expensive tier priced at $299 per month.\n\u274c You want a basic or free plan: Although the basic plan is available for a reasonable monthly fee, it doesn\u2019t include gift cards or Shopify\u2019s monthly reports. There\u2019s also no free plan, but there is a 14-day trial for all plans.\n\u274c You\u2019re wary of transaction fees: Transaction fees are present throughout Shopify\u2019s packages, and apply to both credit card and in-person charges, but they scale down with more premium plans.\n\ud83c\udf10 Shopify represents an easier way to build and manage your web store, but there are more powerful platforms around and you need to pay a relative premium when you compare it to a number of competitors. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nWhat you need to know:\nShopify is perhaps the most well-known and top rated ecommerce platforms as we write and it came a long way since its inception in 2006. True to its word, to use Shopify to create a beautiful online store you don\u2019t require any technical or design skills.\nIt\u2019s a one-stop ecommerce platform that provides everything you need to build and grow your web store: a template-based online store builder, comprehensive product catalog, easy payment processing, automated fulfilment via shipping apps and other integrations, inventory management, powerful analytics and more.\nPlans and pricing:\nThe Basic Shopify plan is available for $29 (around \u00a322.70) a month, and includes a free SSL certificate, and no limits to bandwidth, disk space or products. The only penalties come in the way of only two staff users and 2.2% + 20p transaction fees for online orders and 1.7% + 0p for in-person payments.\nUpgrading to the $79 (around \u00a361.80) Shopify account cuts online credit card charges to 1.9% + 20p, and in-person ones to 1.6%. You also get gift cards, professional reports, up to five staff accounts, and five locations. The most expensive tier is the \u2018Advanced Shopify\u2019 at $299 per month (around \u00a3234). This cuts the online credit card charges down to 1.6% + 20p, in-person charges to 1.5%, gives you up to 15 staff accounts, and can handle 8 locations. Shopify also offers a free 14-day trial, with no credit card details required.\nShopify is purpose built to support online stores, but certainly isn't the cheapest option. If you are looking for something more budget friendly, Weebly is a more affordable alternative. You can get selling online for free with Weebly, although you will have a host of limitations. Paid plans start at just $10/mo.\nEase of use:\nThe Shopify interface does its best to keep options to a minimum. A left-hand sidebar organises features into straightforward categories - Orders, Products, Customers, Analytics, Marketing, Discounts, Apps - while the Dashboard highlights how you should get started (add products, then customise your store). It's all very clean and simple.\nOne problem with this minimalist approach is it's not immediately obvious where you should look to carry out a particular task. Fortunately, a well-designed search system is on hand to point you in the right direction.\nFeatures:\nShopify provides a full-fledged CMS users can use to manage site functionality and layout, which they can also do via Shopify\u2019s mobile apps. A live chat function allows you to have a real-time conversation with your customers, and there\u2019s built-in support for 3D models and videos. Plus, you get an option to create customizable storefronts on Facebook and Instagram.\nShopify also offers unlimited hosting for their stores, in-depth analytics of how visitors are using the store, and powerful marketing tools such as SEO optimization, discounts, a coupon engine, gift cards, and email marketing tools.\nAI has been rolled out extensively across the Shopify platform, with a focus on making it easier and faster to build and grow online stores. Shopify Sidekick offers store owners a dedicated AI assistant that can be used to quickly execute everyday tasks such as creating discount codes and checking stock levels. Shopify Magic sees AI being integrated across the platform, making it available for use in everything from writing product descriptions to editing product imagery.\nSecurity:\nWhen it comes to keeping your online store safe, Shopify has you covered. All Shopify plans include SSL security, which is crucial for protecting sensitive information, like payment details, from hackers and building trust with your customers.\nShopify is also Level 1 PCI DDS compliant, which means your store meets the highest security standards for processing credit/debit card details. In other words, you can be confident that your transactions are secure and your customers\u2019 information is safeguarded.\nOne of the best parts about using Shopify is that they handle all the security updates and core software maintenance for you. Your site is always up-to-date with the latest security patches without you lifting a finger. Plus, Shopify has a strong fraud detection system and sends alerts if there\u2019s any potential security threat, so you can swiftly take action to keep your store safe.\nSupport:\nShopify offers round-the-clock customer support via telephone line, live chat, and email. During testing we found support to be responsive and helpful, which can be mighty helpful when faced with a challenge in setting up, running, or growing your online store.\nRead the full review: Shopify review\nThe best ecommerce platform for big businesses\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want loads of built-in tools: The platform features customizable templates, integrated payment processing systems, built-in marketing tools, and more.\n\u2705 You want great customer support: You can access live chat support through its website, alongside phone support and an email address you can contact \u2013 with an agent getting in touch in under 24 hours.\n\u2705 You want to take advantage of analytics: BigCommerce offers real-time analytics, with access to experts qualified in both Google Analytics and Adwords who can offer advice.\n\u274c You\u2019re just starting out: Although BigCommerce is user-friendly, it isn\u2019t the most beginner-friendly platform out there and may seem overwhelmingly complex if you\u2019re just starting out.\n\u274c You want extensive customization options: Although there are a variety of templates you pick out and customize, these are limited when you compare it to those offered by competitors.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for value-for-money: BigCommerce is fantastic if pricing isn\u2019t an issue for you, but with a number of expensive plans, those looking to making savings should probably shop elsewhere.\n\ud83c\udf10 BigComerce is a feature-rich ecommerce solution that\u2019s prefect for the large businesses and enterprises \u2013 that is, if pricing isn\u2019t an issue. With tools, customer interaction and integrations everywhere you look, you can build the perfect website to support your growing business. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nWhat you need to know:\nLaunched in 2009, BigCommerce is today one of the leading ecommerce platforms providing a splendid level of scalability for online stores \u2013 meaning it can follow and shape your business\u2019 growth.\nMuch like Shopify, BigCommerce provides a variety of templates and themes to help stores look their best and get up and running quickly. Alternatively, users can design their own store or employ BigCommerce designers to do so. The platform incorporates a full-featured CMS that allows users to run an entire site, rather than just an online store.\nDuring testing we found that BigCommerce offers all the tools and features you would expect from a dedicated piece of ecommerce software.\nHowever, with a slightly higher level of complexity than the likes of Shopify, we also found that BigCommerce is better suited to established ecommerce brands that already have a basic understanding of how ecommerce platforms function.\nPlans and pricing:\nBigCommerce\u2019s Standard plan starts at $29.95/month and includes everything you need to get started. BigCommerce Plus plan starts at $79.95/month and includes all the features in the standard plan plus a number of others including customer groups and segmentation, abandoned cart saver, and more advanced reporting tools.\nThe Pro plan is BigCommerce\u2019s basic website builder package and starts at $299.95/month. It includes all the features of the Plus plan plus Google customer reviews, product filtering, and custom product filtering. It also offers online sales up to $400k per year.\nEase of use:\nBigCommerce offers a robust suite of features that make it easy to build a website from scratch. The drag-and-drop builder makes it easy for users to customize their site without needing any coding skills. The platform also offers plenty of features to help you manage your store once it's up and running. You can easily add products, manage orders, process payments, track inventory levels, and more. The only downside is it might not be suitable for beginners, given the breadth of tools and features available.\nFeatures:\nUsers can benefit from detailed and flexible product management, optimized search engine rankings, along with a variety of integrated marketing tools and analytics.\nPayments can be accepted via over 65 pre-integrated gateways, and shipping details can be customized as per the business's requirements. As of late, some new features have been added like support for Amazon Import and Link and Shopping in Instagram Stories.\nThe platform offers automated order processing, flexible tax rules depending on where orders are made and shipped, and support for over 140 currencies. One of the great tools that come with BigCommerce, meanwhile, is BitPay \u2013 the world\u2019s largest provider of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency payment services.\nSecurity:\nKeeping your BigCommerce store secure is the highest priority, and much of the heavy lifting is handled by BigCommerce itself. Features like PCI compliance, two-factor authentication, and SSL encryption are all in place to safeguard your site and transactions.\nHowever, one aspect you'll want to pay attention to is backups. BigCommerce doesn't automatically perform backups for you, so it's smart to have a backup process in place to safeguard your store data if anything goes awry.\nFortunately, BigCommerce offers a range of security settings for both site visitors and customers. From automatically logging out customers after a certain period to enabling reCAPTCHA, you have control over the security of your online store.\nSupport:\nBigCommerce offers live chat support directly from its website. If live chat is different from your style, BigCommerce also offers phone support for their customers. For those who prefer written communication, BigCommerce provides email support as well. All you have to do is fill out an online form on their website and one of their team members will get back to you within 24 hours (or sooner).\nRead the full review: BigCommerce review\nThe best ecommerce platform for physical stores\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to integrate online and in-person sales seamlessly: Square's platform perfectly syncs your physical store inventory with your online store, making omnichannel selling effortless.\n\u2705 You need a user-friendly solution: Square's drag-and-drop website builder requires no coding knowledge, making it ideal for business owners who want to create a professional online presence quickly.\n\u2705 You're looking for built-in marketing tools: Square offers robust marketing features including email campaigns, social media integration, and customer engagement tools to help grow your business.\n\u274c You want extensive customization options: While Square offers customizable templates, its design flexibility is somewhat limited compared to competitors like Wix or Shopify.\n\u274c You need advanced ecommerce features: Square's platform may lack some sophisticated features that larger online-only businesses might require for complex operations.\n\u274c You're concerned about checkout experience: Square redirects customers to a different domain during checkout, which might affect the seamless shopping experience for your customers.\n\ud83c\udf10 Square offers an excellent ecommerce solution that bridges the gap between physical and online retail, making it perfect for businesses that already operate brick-and-mortar locations or use Square's POS system. With its straightforward approach and integrated payment processing, it provides everything needed to extend your physical store into the digital realm. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nWhat you need to know:\nSquare Online is an adaptive ecommerce platform that has been especially designed with brick-and-mortar store businesses in mind.

Square's ecosystem model enables merchants to operate their entire business\u2014from point-of-sale to online orders\u2014within one platform.\nDuring our tests, we found that the Square website builder platform was best suited for retailers, restaurants, and service companies who already use the Square POS platform, who are now looking to expand their presence online without exposing themselves to complex integrations or learning essentially new systems.\nPlans and pricing:\nSquare provides an incredibly generous free plan with unlimited products, simple search engine optimization tools, inventory tracking, and multi-channel selling features.

The transaction fee remains 2.9% + 30\u00a2 per sale.\nThe $79/year Premium plan provides the best value and additional features, including lower transaction fees, live shipping estimates, and priority support.\nSquare's prices are clear and upfront with no hidden costs, although companies must consider that additional fees for certain templates, apps, and Square POS functions are possible depending on individual needs.\nEase of use:\nSquare's store builder features a simple drag-and-drop builder that anyone without a designing background can use to build a professional online store. The platform facilitates launch by walking you step by step through simple-to-understand instructions and intuitive templates.\nWe particularly liked the ease of importing existing inventory from a Square POS system, which populates your online store with products, descriptions, and images with no manual effort. It significantly reduces the time it takes to set up an online store for businesses already committed to Square's ecosystem.\nFeatures:\nSquare Online has features that are specifically meant for both online and offline stores. The website has feature-rich product management where you can add unlimited products with various images, in-depth descriptions, and variations.\nThe inventory sync feature automatically synchronizes the inventory levels in all the sales channels, preventing over-selling and providing real-time inventory visibility.

Two-factor authentication adds a layer of security for store owners when accessing the backend system.\nSupport:\nSquare offers good support facilities too. The knowledge base contains detailed guides, tutorials, and troubleshooting information on each aspect of how to install and operate an online shop.\nAll users have email support backing them, with phone support available for Plus and Premium subscription holders. Additionally, Square also maintains a forum where users can interact with each other on ideas and solutions.\nFor businesses on Premium plans, Square provides priority support with faster response times and dedicated handling of more complex problems.

With its intuitive drag-and-drop interface and extensive library of mobile-friendly themes, Weebly makes it easy to create stunning websites without any coding knowledge.\nWhile it may not offer as many customization options as some other platforms, Weebly's simplicity and affordability make it an ideal choice for small businesses looking to establish a professional online presence quickly and efficiently.\nWhat you need to know:\nLaunched in 2006, Weebly has made its mark as a well-liked website builder, striking a balance between simplicity and functionality. Its drag-and-drop interface allows you to customize your site with ease, while its robust ecommerce tools make it a smart choice for an online store.\nWeebly is a fantastic option for budget conscious online stores. However, it comes with customization, product, and storage limitations. Large, growing, and ambitious online stores are likely to be better off with a dedicated ecommerce software such as Shopify or BigCommerce.\nPlans and pricing:\nWith Weebly, you\u2019ll find several subscription plans for different business needs. The Personal plan, starting at $10/month billed annually or $13 month-to-month, provides essential features for individuals and small businesses.

We're big fans of its selection of mobile-responsive themes and essential features like SEO optimization and ecommerce tools.\nHowever, we have to admit that some of the available templates didn't quite meet our expectations in terms of quality. Likewise, while Weebly offers a decent level of customization, we found that it falls short compared to some other platforms we've tried.\nSecurity:\nWeebly's got your back when it comes to website security. With just a click, you can get a free SSL certificate, keeping your visitors' data safe and sound. Plus, Weebly ensures compliance with PCI standards for secure transactions, so you can rest easy knowing your customers' payment information is under protection.\nBut that's not all. Weebly goes the extra mile to keep your site secure. From secure data centers to regular updates and malware scans, they've got all the bases covered. Plus, if you want added protection, you can opt for two-factor authentication for additional peace of mind. In short, you can rest easy knowing your site is in good hands with Weebly.\nSupport:\nIf you have a question, Weebly's got your back. Whether you prefer to shoot them an email, chat online, or give them a ring, their friendly support team is ready to assist. Plus, if you're on a higher-tier plan, you'll enjoy priority support and even phone assistance for those trickier questions.\nRead the full review: Weebly website builder review\nThe best ecommerce platform for shop design\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're new to website building: Squarespace's good-looking templates and user-friendly drag-and-drop interface make it perfect for those new to website creation, requiring no coding skills at all.\n\u2705 You require diverse template options: With over 100 mobile-responsive templates available, Squarespace offers a wide range of options suitable for various purposes.\n\u2705 You seek scalability and support: Squarespace offers unlimited bandwidth and storage, along with integrated ecommerce features, giving your growing business the solid support it needs to handle more traffic and transactions.\n\u274c You plan to sell in multiple currencies: Squarespace's transaction fees and lack of support for selling in multiple currencies may not be suitable for businesses operating in diverse markets.\n\u274c You prefer telephone support: Squarespace's customer support options do not include telephone support, which may be a drawback for users who prefer direct assistance.\n\u274c You want extensive customization choices: While Squarespace offers a solid set of features, its customization options may be limited for users with specific design needs or branding requirements.\n\ud83c\udf10 Squarespace is a standout option, especially if you're looking to create an eye-catching website with minimal fuss. We particularly enjoyed its vast array of beautiful templates and its intuitive interface, which made the whole website-building process a breeze.\nWhile it might not offer as much customization as some other platforms, Squarespace more than makes up for it with its comprehensive feature set and reliable support. So, if you're in the market for a website builder that prioritizes design and user-friendliness, Squarespace is worth a shot.\nWhat you need to know:\nSquarespace is a one-stop solution for all things website-related. Whether you're looking to catch a domain, host your site in the cloud, or build a stunning online store, Squarespace has got your back. What's best is that you don't need to be a tech whiz to make a beautiful yet professional website - their user-friendly system and drag-and-drop interface make it surprisingly simple.\nAlthough Squarespace offers some of the most stunning website templates on the market, there are limits on how far these can be customized. In our Wix vs Squarespace study, we found that Wix is a better option if the ability to edit and change your website's look and feel is important.\nPricing and plans:\nWhen it comes to pricing, Squarespace offers four distinct plans, starting from $16 and going up to $53/month, with options for annual billing for those who prefer it. However, you can save big on these by using one of our Squarespace promo codes at checkout. Regardless of the plan you choose, you'll get essential features like unlimited bandwidth and storage, along with a complimentary custom domain.\nIt's worth noting that the \"Business\" plan carries a 3% transaction fee on sales, which could impact businesses with growing sales volumes. However, if you opt for the Commerce (whether Basic or Advanced version), you'll enjoy the benefit of no transaction fees, which makes it a solid choice for businesses focused on sales.\nEase of use:\nSquarespace prides itself on its user-friendly approach, making website building a breeze for both beginners and seasoned pros. With its drag-and-drop interface and a wide selection of pre-designed templates, crafting a professional-looking website is as simple as it gets.\nHowever, if you're thinking of switching templates down the line, be prepared to start from square one, as there's no way to seamlessly transition between them.\nFeatures:\nAs we delved into Squarespace's feature set, we were glad to discover a wide array of tools designed to elevate your website. From media marketing functionalities to seamless ecommerce integrations, Squarespace truly has it all. Plus, the robust analytics tools provided allow you to stay on top of your site's performance without much effort.\nSquarespace's Blueprint AI website builder can help you quickly create a stunning website via the power of AI, helping you to get selling faster than ever before.\nIt's worth mentioning that while you have the freedom to add unlimited products to your online store and leverage SEO and social media marketing features, some functionalities, such as manual payments and multi-currency selling, may not be as comprehensive as those offered by competitors like Shopify.\nSecurity:\nSquarespace will keep your website and its visitors safe with a robust lineup of security features. Each Squarespace site comes equipped with SSL certificates, two-factor authentication, a defense against denial of service (DoS) attacks, page passwords, and a login activity panel. We should note that the login activity panel won't single-handedly shield your site but it provides insights into any suspicious login attempts.\nTo ensure round-the-clock protection, Squarespace's security team monitors all sites for potential threats and vulnerabilities. If you run into a potential vulnerability, you can report it to the security team, who will promptly investigate the matter.\nAdditionally, Squarespace Payments and its payment processors - Stripe, PayPal, and Square - comply with applicable PCI standards, ensuring secure transactions for both you and your customers.\nSupport:\nIf you ever find yourself in need of assistance, rest assured that Squarespace has your back with a range of support options. Whether you prefer reaching out via live chat, email, or social media channels, help is always just a click away. We particularly appreciated the availability of live chat support during the workweek, which ensures prompt assistance in case of trouble.\nAdditionally, Squarespace's well-stocked Help Center, complete with video guides and a bustling community forum, offers valuable self-service solutions. However, it's worth noting that if you prefer resolving issues over the phone, this option isn't currently available.\nRead our full review: Squarespace website builder review\nBest ecommerce platform for beginners\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 If you're a startup eager to get your online store up and running swiftly: GoDaddy's user-friendly ADI tool makes the process a breeze.\n\u2705 You\u2019re seeking simplicity and convenience: GoDaddy's ADI feature lets you create a website by answering a few questions, which is perfect for those who want to skip the complexities of extensive customization.\n\u2705 You want built-in marketing tools to boost your online presence effortlessly: GoDaddy's got you covered with great options for email campaigns and performance analysis.\n\u274c You crave full control over your website's design and layout: GoDaddy's ADI approach will likely feel limited in terms of creative freedom.\n\u274c You seek advanced ecommerce features: While GoDaddy's platform is easy to use, it may lack the depth and customization options found in competitors like Squarespace and Shopify.\n\u274c You want a seamless checkout experience for your customers: GoDaddy's ecommerce solution redirects customers to a different domain during checkout, which could raise trust and branding concerns.\n\ud83c\udf10 GoDaddy's website builder, powered by ADI, offers a quick and easy way for startups and small businesses to establish an online presence. We appreciated its intuitive interface and handy marketing tools, making it a solid choice for those looking for simplicity.\nHowever, we found its limitations in creative control and ecommerce features might not suit everyone's needs, particularly those with more complex requirements or larger-scale businesses.\nWhat you need to know:\nFounded in 1997 and renowned for its domain registration, GoDaddy also offers a rock-solid website builder solution. With a user-friendly interface and competitive pricing, this website builder is an attractive option, especially for newcomers diving into the world of online presence creation.\nWhether you're already a GoDaddy customer or exploring options for your website, we believe GoDaddy's easy-to-use website builder is worth considering. However, if you need extensive ecommerce tools and feature, an alternative such as Shopify may be a better fit for you.\nWe have also compared Wix vs GoDaddy. Our tests found that although Wix certainly offers a more complete and editable platform, GoDaddy delivers all the features you need to create a simple, yet effective online store - all at a significantly more budget friendly price.\nPricing and plans:\nFrom individuals to small businesses and all sizes of ecommerce ventures, GoDaddy offers flexible options. We also appreciated the inclusion of a free plan, allowing users to test the platform before committing to a paid subscription.\nStarting at $10.99/month, the Basic plan includes essential features such as SSL, custom domain connection, and customer support. If you need more flexibility, the Standard plan, priced at $10.49/month, offers increased email and social media limits, along with built-in SEO options.\nFor those seeking even more features, the Premium plan, priced at $14.99/month, supports unlimited social media platforms and posts, along with appointment scheduling and reminders. Meanwhile, the Ecommerce plan, starting at $16.99/month, provides solid features for online selling, including product listings, flexible payments, and promotional tools.\nIt is worth noting that the rates we quote above are introductory rates and will increase once your plan automatically renews, so it is worth checking what you will pay after the introductory period is over.\nHowever, while GoDaddy's pricing is competitive, we found that some features may be lacking compared to other providers in the market.\nEase of use:\nOur experience with GoDaddy's website builder revealed its user-friendly nature, making it ideal for individuals with limited website-building experience. Powered by artificial design intelligence (ADI), GoDaddy simplifies the website building process, guiding users through customization options effortlessly.\nHowever, we did notice that the use of ADI limits creative freedom, and the design templates may feel somewhat rigid for users seeking more customization options.\nFeatures:\nGoDaddy's website builder offers a solid suite of business tools, including appointment scheduling, email marketing, social media management, graphic design, and CRM functionalities. We particularly liked how these integrated tools made it easier to manage different aspects of our website and marketing efforts in one place.\nHowever, it's important to note that while these tools are effective for basic needs, users requiring more advanced features may find them lacking compared to specialized platforms. Additionally, we found that the builder's design customization options are somewhat limited, which may restrict users seeking a high level of creative control over their websites.\nMoreover, we observed that the availability of app integrations is relatively restricted, which could pose challenges for users looking to extend the functionality of their sites beyond the built-in features. Despite these limitations, we found GoDaddy's website builder to be a user-friendly option for start-ups and small businesses seeking a comprehensive online solution.\nGoDaddy Airo is another great solution for beginners. This platforms helps small businesses leverage the power of AI to create a full set of business assets, including logos, social media plans, and a fully populated website.\nSecurity:\nGoDaddy prioritizes strong security across its plans, providing robust features such as SSL encryption to safeguard customer transactions and data privacy. All website builder plans include SSL certificates, which encrypt data transmitted between the server and the visitor's browser, keeping it confidential.\nThe Ecommerce plan includes PCI-compliant solutions such as GoDaddy Payments, Online Store, and Online Appointments, enhancing security. Adhering to PCI standards ensures that customer payment information is protected, building confidence and credibility. By focusing on security, GoDaddy helps businesses gain trust and credibility, which are crucial for building long-lasting customer relationships and growing their business.\nSupport:\nAt GoDaddy, users can expect comprehensive support options tailored to their needs. The knowledge base features helpful how-to videos and guides, complemented by round-the-clock customer support, an active community forum, and informative blog posts.\nYou have access to live chat support, which initially connects you with a chatbot and then transfers you to a human agent if further assistance is required. Additionally, you can contact GoDaddy via phone support, with toll-free numbers available in select countries.\nFrom what we've observed, GoDaddy aims to deliver timely support, but the response times may vary depending on the volume of support requests.\nYou can save on your GoDaddy subscription with our GoDaddy promo codes.\nRead the full review: GoDaddy website builder review\nMeet the author\nOwain has an extensive background in business and marketing. He has spent over 7 years testing website builders, building his own ecommerce stores, and writing about business and marketing topics. Owain has also built several online stores, including a Scandi-inspired homeware store.\nHow to choose the best ecommerce platform for you\nIn today's fast-paced online marketplace, finding the perfect ecommerce software can be your business's best buddy. However, with so many choices out there, it's critical to think about what you really need to ensure this platform aligns with your business goals and needs. To cut to the chase, here are a few things you'll want to consider before selecting an ecommerce platform for your business:\n1. Tools and functionality\nWhen evaluating ecommerce solutions, keep an eye out for essential tools like SSL certification, fraud prevention, data backups, and PCI compliance. These are the foundation stones that ensure your customers' data remains safe and secure.\nTo boost your site's visibility, seek out platforms that offer SEO-friendly features such as customizable meta descriptions, integrated blogging capabilities, and customer review functionalities. Additionally, prioritize platforms that embrace responsive web design, ensuring seamless access across all devices.\nTo steer your business in the right direction, look for platforms that provide built-in analytics features, allowing you to track store performance and spot emerging trends. Consider platforms that support multiple selling channels, from social media platforms like Facebook Messenger to established marketplaces like Amazon, to expand your market reach and revenue streams.\nLastly, opt for platforms that offer extensive integrations and plugins, empowering you to customize and enhance your store's functionality as your business evolves. Also, having active community support can provide ongoing improvements and swift issue resolution to keep your ecommerce venture ahead of the curve.\n2. Price and costs\nWhile open-source software may appear budget-friendly upfront, it's crucial to weigh in other expenses like the fees of the best web hosting providers, security compliance, and ongoing maintenance. Also, keep an eye on transaction fees, as they can significantly spike up your overall costs.\nOn the flip side, subscription-based platforms may require a monthly fee, but they often include maintenance and support services, making them a cost-effective option in the long run. Don't forget to consider your budget and future growth plans when evaluating the pricing models of ecommerce software.\n3. Security\nWith the increasing prevalence of online threats, security is more important than ever, especially for ecommerce software. When selecting a platform, it's crucial to prioritize security features like SSL encryption, data encryption, and tools to prevent fraud. Make sure the platform you choose is committed to protecting your customers' data and regularly updates its security measures to keep up with evolving threats.\nAfter all, safeguarding your business from cyber threats is crucial for building trust and maintaining a successful online presence.\n4. Ability to grow your store\nScalability is essential for the long-term success of your ecommerce business. Choose a platform that offers features tailored to accommodate your business's expanding needs, such as flexible infrastructure, customizable designs, and seamless integrations with third-party applications.\nAdditionally, consider platforms that support omnichannel marketing strategies, which will allow you to reach customers across multiple channels and boost sales.\nAll in all, picking the best ecommerce software is a bit like putting together a puzzle - you need to find the pieces that fit perfectly. By considering your needs and priorities, you'll be able to pick out a platform that helps your online business grow and thrive.\nHow we tested the best ecommerce platforms\nTesting out website builders thoroughly is our mission, and here's how we test ecommerce platforms to find the best one:\nSign up for the ecommerce platform\nWe begin by signing up for the chosen ecommerce platform, in this case, Square One. This initial step allows us to gain access to the platform's dashboard and explore its features and functionalities firsthand. During the signup process, we pay close attention to the ease of registration and any initial setup requirements.\nBuild a test site\nOnce signed up, we go on to build a test site on the platform. This involves creating a simplified version of an ecommerce website to check the platform's ease of use and customization options. We examine available templates, elements, and page layouts to rate the flexibility and creativity offered by the platform's builder.\nExplore and test ecommerce features\nNext, we delve into the ecommerce features offered by the platform. This includes examining payment options, product management tools, checkout processes, shipping settings, and more.\nDesk research\nAside from our hands-on testing, we also dive into desk research to gather more insights into the platform. This means looking into its pricing plans and any potential hidden fees or limitations. We also explore the platform's security measures, such as SSL certification and PCI compliance.\nIn the end, we compare the platform to its competition, focusing on ease of use, features, pricing transparency, customer support, and scalability. Our recommendations and insights aim to help you choose the right ecommerce platform for your online business.\nBest ecommerce platforms: Summary\nIn our search for the best ecommerce platforms, we've discovered that simplicity, functionality, and standout design are crucial.\nWix stands out as an all-in-one solution, perfect for newcomers with its intuitive interface and comprehensive features.

If you\u2019re ready to dive in, explore your top picks with free trials or money-back guarantees to find the perfect match for your online project.\nBest ecommerce platforms FAQs\nWhat is an ecommerce platform?\nAn ecommerce platform is a piece of software that allows individuals and businesses to create and manage online stores, enabling them to sell products and services across the internet. These platforms handle everything from displaying your products to processing payments and managing orders, making it easier for your online store to prosper among many competitors.\nAdditionally, these platforms come packed with tools for website design, marketing campaigns, and tracking analytics, empowering businesses to create a compelling online presence and attract customers.\nWhat types of ecommerce platforms are there?\nWhen it comes to picking an ecommerce platform, you've got three main types to choose from:\n1. Open-source software: If you possess technical know-how with an in-house development team, this option gives you complete control and flexibility.\n2. Software as a service (SaaS): These platforms are perfect if you want to hit the ground running without dealing with software building or maintenance. They're beginner-friendly but also pretty flexible for your in-house techies and often come with handy API libraries.\n3. Headless ecommerce: With these types of platforms, you can separate the shopping cart from the content management system, offering you tons of flexibility for future front-end changes. It's a popular choice right now because it gives you control over marketing, sales, and product assets while still offering flexibility on the front end.\nEach type of platform has its pros and cons and is suited to different business needs. So, consider your requirements carefully before making a choice.\nWhich ecommerce platforms are like Shopify?\nShopify is a purpose built platform for ecommerce websites. If you are looking for something dedicated like Shopify your best options are BigCommerce or Square. Both of these platforms are also purpose built for ecommerce businesses, offering plenty of tools and features for managing stock, promoting your store, and taking payments.\nSquare is more affordable and integrates well into Square\u2019s Point Of Sale (POS) system, making it one of the best small business website builders. In contrast, BigCommerce tends to appeal more to enterprise level businesses, with advanced analytics and collaboration tools.\nWhat hidden fees do ecommerce platforms have?\nHidden fees can seriously impact your business profits. Taking some time to research potential hidden fees will help you better plan and budget.\nAlmost all ecommerce platforms will charge a transaction fee when you make a sale. Usually, this will be a percentage of the sale along with a small flat fee (such as 2.5% + $0.20). Some platforms will adjust the amount they charge based on the plan you are on, this can often make more expensive plans cheaper in the long run for stores that make a high volume of sales.\nThird party payment processors such as PayPal will also charge you a fee when you take a payment through its platform. This may be in addition to fees charged by the ecommerce platforms. However, this isn\u2019t always the case. For example, when you take a PayPal payment through Wix, you are only charged a fee by PayPal, not Wix. If you sell internationally, you will also want to understand any currency conversion fees.\nEcommerce platforms are generally transparent about what you get with each plan. However, you will sometimes find specific features and tools behind a paywall that you didn't expect. For example, almost all ecommerce platforms will offer a level of website analytics in all plans, but once you dig a little deeper you may find that more advanced plans offer a much greater level of data collection and insight.\nApp stores and third-party plug-ins are a great way to extend the functionality of your store. Although many of these will come with a free trial or a basic free plan, to unlock advanced features you will likely need to sign up to a subscription. For most apps and plug-ins these subscriptions are very affordable, but can add up when multiple apps are added at one time.\nAlthough some ecommerce platforms will offer you a free custom domain with your website plan, the fee-free period typically only lasts one year. Upon renewal, you will be charged for your domain, so it is important to build this into your financial planning.\nSome additional fees you may incur when using an ecommerce platform include fees for additional bandwidth or storage, security and compliance costs, and refund or chargeback fees.\nAll of these fees are to be expected when running an ecommerce business. However, failure to note and understand them can lead to an unforeseen impact on your business profit over the years.\nHow long does it take to launch an ecommerce website?\nIf you're aiming for a simple online store with standard features and a template-based design, you might be up and running within a few weeks to a couple of months. However, if you're dreaming of a fully customized website with unique design elements, advanced functionality, and many integrations, be prepared to invest anywhere from three to six months or more. If you're tackling a large-scale enterprise project with complex requirements, it could take over a year to bring your idea to life.\nIn short, the time needed to build an ecommerce website depends on multiple factors, including its complexity, required features, chosen platform, and customization level.\nWhat are the best ecommerce platforms?\nWix is the best ecommerce platform for most online stores. It offers a huge range of powerful ecommerce solutions as well as a helpful AI website builder and other AI-powered tools that help you get your store online and growing quickly. Plans with ecommerce plans start at $29/mo, making it very affordable.\nLarger online stores may benefit from opting for a dedicated ecommerce platform such as Shopify or BigCommerce. Both of these will let you sell online from $29/mo and deliver a larger range of ecommerce tools, although also come with a steeper learning curve.\nWill I be charged transaction fees?\nYou may be charged a fee for each sale you make using some of the ecommerce platforms we recommend above. However, transaction fees are typically only charged on free and low-cost plans. If you opt for a higher level plan this will usually also include the benefit of the removal of transaction fees.\nWhether a lower priced/free plan with transaction fees or a premium plan without transaction fees is right for you will depend on how much you plan on selling through your website. Almost all dedicated online stores will benefit from paying a higher subscription fee to remove transaction fees.\nWhat level of customer support is available with ecommerce platforms?\nEach ecommerce platform will offer different types of customer support. This usually includes one, or several methods of communication, including forums, email, phone, and live chat.\nYou may also find that different plans from the same ecommerce platform come with different levels of support. For example, you may get email support on a basic plan, but get 24/7 phone support on a top of the range plan.\nIt is important to understand what support you will be able to access before picking a plan. Even though premium support usually costs more, if you are a beginner, or you run a fast paced ecommerce store, being able to access top quality support quickly can pay dividends in the long run.\nIn this guide, we provide you with a brief overview of the types and level of support each ecommerce platform offers.\nWhat are potential challenges I should be aware of when launching/running an ecommerce website?\nLaunching and running an eCommerce website comes with its set of challenges you should be aware of:\n1. Choosing the right products or services: Selecting the right products to sell online is crucial for ecommerce success. This step covers researching market demand, analyzing competition, and identifying profitable niches.\n2. Identifying your target audiences: Understanding your target audience's needs, preferences, and behavior is critical for coming up with effective marketing strategies.\n3. Developing effective sales and marketing messages: Crafting compelling sales and marketing messages that resonate with your target audience can help drive traffic and sales to your online store.\n4. Allocating digital marketing budgets: Determining how to allocate your digital marketing budget across various channels such as social media, search engine optimization (SEO), and paid advertising is essential for maximizing your return on investment (ROI).\n5. Building social proof for your business: Building trust and credibility with potential customers through social proof elements such as customer reviews, testimonials, and social media engagement can help increase sales and conversions.\n6. Designing an eye-catching yet user-friendly online store: Creating a user-friendly and intuitive ecommerce website design that provides a seamless shopping experience for customers is a must.\n7. Increasing conversions: Implementing conversion rate optimization (CRO) strategies such as optimizing product pages, improving checkout processes, and offering personalized recommendations can help boost conversions and sales.\n8. Improving customer retention: Implementing strategies like loyalty programs, personalized communication, and splendid customer service is crucial for long-term ecommerce success.\n9. Mastering logistics management: Effectively managing inventory, order fulfillment, and shipping logistics to ensure timely delivery and customer satisfaction is essential.\n10. Keeping your ecommerce site secure: Ensuring customer data protection, fraud prevention, and transaction security through SSL encryption, PCI compliance, and regular security audits is crucial for maintaining customer trust and credibility in the long run.\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to foresee everything, by considering these common challenges in ecommerce, you'll be better prepared to navigate the complexities of running a successful online store.\nCan I create my own ecommerce solution?\nOf course, if you want complete control over every aspect of your new online store, building each page yourself will be the best course of action.\nHiring someone to code your website is one option. If you decide to do this, follow these steps:\n1. Ask the company for live examples of their work to look at;\n2. Write a detailed brief of the site you want to be created. The more detail the better to avoid confusion;\n3. Ensure you understand the price you are being charged and how many revisions this price includes;\n4. Always have a signed agreement or contract before work commences;\n5. Ask whether the designers will host your site and if you will be able to make updates yourself or if all updates must go through the design agency at an additional cost;\n6. Ask for the copyright of your design to be assigned to your company, as your website is an important part of your business' intellectual property;\n7. Put into your contract, details of how the agreement can be amicably dissolved if things go wrong.\nAlso, you don't have to build your site completely from scratch. Buying a template can give you all the basic pages your site needs. You can then either modify them yourself using an application like Dreamweaver or hire a coding expert to make the changes. Website templates are available from a number of vendors including Template Monster.\nIf you already have a website and want to add ecommerce functionality, this can be easily achieved with applications such as XCart, Kryptronic, and CubeCart.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nOwain has been building websites and online stores for his own and his client's businesses for over 8 years.

      "text": "Fragmented security: the hidden threat undermining your cyber defenses\nMany companies overlook a critical vulnerability\nCyber attacks are making headlines with their growing frequency and complexity, but for global businesses, there\u2019s another challenge that often slips under the radar. As companies focus on fending off the next big breach, many are overlooking a critical internal vulnerability: fragmented security born from the proliferation of connected assets.\nWith every new innovation, the digital footprint of an organization expands - more devices, more applications, more endpoints. But this rapid growth has outpaced traditional cybersecurity strategies, leaving behind blind spots and disjointed defenses.\nThe result? An increasingly fragile security posture that attackers are all too eager to exploit. It\u2019s time for the C-suite to look beyond the obvious threats and address the structural cracks in their cybersecurity foundation.\nPresident of Armis.\nThe first crack\nMost organizations don\u2019t deliberately set out to build disjointed systems, but as they grow, so do their cybersecurity needs. To tackle emerging threats, plug vulnerabilities or meet new compliance mandates, companies often adopt a variety of tools, each designed for a specific task - from threat detection to audit readiness.\nThe result is a patchwork of point solutions that operate in isolation. These tools rarely integrate or share data seamlessly, creating silos that limit oversight and hinder response. Over time, what was meant to strengthen security ends up weakening it. Instead, businesses are left with a fragmented system that struggles to deliver a unified, real-time picture of risk.\nThe problem with fragmented security\nThese gaps don\u2019t just weaken the system; they make it difficult for security teams to even see where the weaknesses are. In a fragmented environment, a basic but critical question becomes surprisingly hard to answer: \u201cWhat do we have?\u201d Without a clear understanding of the organization's full asset inventory - across devices, platforms and cloud computing environments - security teams are left guessing at where the true risks lie.\nThis lack of awareness is exactly what attackers exploit. Threats can go undetected not because the tools aren\u2019t capable, but because the necessary context is scattered across disconnected systems. When data isn\u2019t shared, alerts are missed, and teams can\u2019t respond quickly or confidently. Instead of a single, coordinated defense, companies are left managing isolated pieces that fail to add up to a complete picture.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nAdditionally, with the UK government placing a heavy emphasis on cybersecurity regulations, such as the Cyber Security and Resilience Bill, organizations need to ensure they meet compliance requirements to avoid penalties and reputational damage. Fragmented security makes achieving this far more difficult, as businesses will struggle to maintain accurate records, demonstrate accountability or provide evidence of effective risk management.\nFinally, managing multiple disconnected tools increases operational complexity. Security teams are already overwhelmed as they deal with numerous interfaces, workflows and requirements, which slows down response times and increases the likelihood of errors. There are also significant financial implications to consider when it comes to fragmented security. Maintaining and integrating multiple tools is both labor-intensive and expensive. And, overlapping functionalities and inefficiencies in resource allocation only work to exacerbate these costs.\nWhy unified cybersecurity is no longer optional\nWith fragmented security solutions presenting an array of challenges, it\u2019s time for organizations to migrate to a unified cybersecurity platform - not just to simplify operations, but to gain true cyber exposure management. A unified approach replaces siloed processes with contextual awareness: understanding every asset, how it\u2019s connected, and what\u2019s at risk.\nUnified cybersecurity also enhances operational efficiency. By using AI-driven capabilities, organizations can simplify security management, automate routine tasks and provide actionable insights that empower security teams to detect, prioritize and mitigate risks in real-time. By eliminating the complexity of managing disparate tools and systems, organizations can transition from reactive measures to proactive threat detection and mitigation, strengthening their overall security posture.\nIn short, these unified platforms cover every aspect of cyber threat exposure management, from asset management to early warning threat detection, vulnerability discovery, prioritization and remediation, into a single solution.\nThe future can\u2019t be fragmented\nAs cyber threats evolve, the cracks in a fragmented security strategy will only widen. Point solutions can\u2019t deliver the speed, coordination or coverage that today\u2019s digital environments demand.\nTo stay ahead, organizations must adopt a unified cybersecurity strategy - one that consolidates asset visibility, threat detection, risk prioritization and compliance into a single platform. Unified security reduces complexity, allows for faster responses and builds long-term resilience.\nFragmentation has served its time. For businesses looking to protect their future, the path forward is clear: consolidate, simplify and strengthen.\nWe list the best software asset management (SAM) tool.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Security\u2019s blind spot: the problem with taking CVE scores at face value\nIn 2024 alone, over 33,000 new Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures were reported\nThe modern software supply chain is operating under unprecedented pressure as new vulnerabilities emerge at a record pace. In 2024 alone, more than 33,000 new Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) have been reported \u2013 a record figure pushing security teams and developers to triage vulnerabilities at scale while trying to stay focused on their core vulnerabilities.\nYet, despite the high number of CVEs labelled \u201ccritical\u201d, a closer look reveals that many of these threats aren\u2019t nearly as severe in practice. In fact, recent research found that just 12% of these CVEs were flagged as \u201ccritical\u201d by official sources truly warranted that designation.\nThis disconnect highlights a growing challenge for the cybersecurity industry. Although established CVE scoring systems like MITRE offer a useful baseline, they often fail to account for the unique context of each organization's environment. As a result, teams risk focusing on theoretical risks while genuine threats may be overlooked.\nDirector of Threat Research at JFrog.\nTake, for example, CVE-2024-45490 \u2013 a vulnerability in a widely used software tool that received a 9.8 CVSS Score. Although it received a \u201cCritical\u201d rating, further analysis and context revealed it is only applicable in 10% of cases. Exploiting this flaw would require a very specific and unlikely set of conditions for developers, making real-world exploitation extremely improbable.\nTo bring greater clarity to teams evaluating CVEs, security leaders should establish a checks and balances system of evaluating these threats with the necessary contextual analysis. This approach can help teams cut through the noise of low-risk vulnerabilities and ensure resources are directed toward their most pressing security problems.\nWhy context matters more than classification\nA recent analysis of 140 high-profile CVEs revealed that 88% of Critical and 57% of High CVE scores were not as severe as the CVSS scoring would have you believe. Only 27 CVEs (15%) were found to be truly highly exploitable.\nThis highlights the importance of assessing the real-world context of CVEs. Without this information, misclassification can lead to alert fatigue, drain productivity and morale, and increase the risk of human error, which can cause more harm than the vulnerabilities themselves.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nBy factoring in aspects of the CVE like exploitability in their specific environment, exposure levels, and business impact, teams can make more informed decisions about which vulnerabilities demand immediate attention.\nThe toll on developers and security teams\nThe constant flood of security warnings and CVE disclosures makes it increasingly difficult to distinguish real threats from less urgent issues. Over time, this overwhelming volume of alerts can erode focus, leading to burnout, slower response times, and a greater likelihood of dangerous mistakes. As threat actors grow more sophisticated, the risk of critical issues slipping through the cracks only intensifies.\nA major contributor to this fatigue is the prevalence of false positives. When security tools flag benign activity as malicious, analysts are still required to investigate these alerts to rule out real threats. Instead of focusing on building new features or improving existing products, developers are also often pulled away to respond to a barrage of other security notifications, many of which turn out to be inconsequential.\nUltimately, vulnerability fatigue not only hampers the effectiveness of security teams and developers alike but also puts organizations at greater risk of serious security incidents. To break this cycle, organizations need smarter, context-driven prioritization that empowers teams to focus on what truly matters.\nA smarter way forward\nThe ever-growing list of CVEs demands a smarter, more strategic approach, one that goes beyond surface-level assessments. Context is king. By taking the time to understand how vulnerability applies to their unique environment, organizations can avoid unnecessary panic and instead zero in on risk.\nAdopting a context-first mindset also facilitates better alignment between security leaders and business decision-makers. It supports a more measured, collaborative approach to risk that balances security with agility, resilience, and innovation.\nIn a world where every alert can feel like a fire drill, the ability to distinguish real threats from false alarms is more than a convenience. It\u2019s a necessity.\nWe've listed the best firewalls for small business.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

  "argos_summary": "The article argues that treating every vulnerability as urgent leads to alert fatigue and inefficiency. It advocates a risk\u2011based patching approach that prioritises based on asset criticality, exposure and real\u2011world exploit data, using a unified inventory and threat intelligence feeds. By integrating context, collaboration between security and ops, and a central dashboard, teams can focus on truly critical flaws and improve patching discipline.",
