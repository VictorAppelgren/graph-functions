  "content": "A number of stocks traded in opposite directions in the afternoon session after positive inflation data fueled hopes for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed inflation rose by a modest 0.2% in July and 2.7% over the last year. This cooler-than-expected data prompted a significant market rally, with the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq all climbing as investors grew more optimistic. The prevailing view is that easing inflation gives the central bank room to lower interest rates. Lower rates typically reduce borrowing costs for businesses and make stocks more attractive relative to bonds, contributing to widespread gains across sectors like healthcare.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\u2022 Healthcare Technology for Patients company Tandem Diabetes (NASDAQ:TNDM) jumped 7.7%.

Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nFortrea\u2019s shares are extremely volatile and have had 58 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for Fortrea and indicate this news significantly impacted the market\u2019s perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago when the stock dropped 4.4% on the news that the company reported mixed second-quarter financial results, where a massive net loss overshadowed a revenue beat and raised guidance. The contract research organization posted revenues of $710.3 million, which exceeded analysts' expectations. However, investors focused on a staggering GAAP net loss of $374.9 million for the quarter. This loss resulted primarily from a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $309.1 million. A goodwill impairment is an accounting adjustment made when the value of a company's assets declined. Fortrea attributed this charge to its own falling share price and market-driven interest rate increases. Further concerns arose from a weak book-to-bill ratio of 0.79x, which indicated the company secured less new business than it billed during the period.",

      "text": "Fortrea (FTRE)\nFortrea faces an uphill battle. Its falling revenue and negative returns on capital suggest it\u2019s destroying value as demand fizzles out.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Fortrea Will Underperform\nSpun off from Labcorp in 2023 to focus exclusively on clinical research services, Fortrea (NASDAQ:FTRE) is a contract research organization that helps pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device companies develop and bring their products to market through clinical trials and support services.\n- Sales were less profitable over the last four years as its earnings per share fell by 36.3% annually, worse than its revenue declines\n- Push for growth has led to negative returns on capital, signaling value destruction, and its decreasing returns suggest its historical profit centers are aging\n- Unfavorable liquidity position could lead to additional equity financing that dilutes shareholders\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Fortrea\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Fortrea\nFortrea is trading at $6.24 per share, or 10.6x forward P/E. This multiple is cheaper than most healthcare peers, but we think this is justified.\nCheap stocks can look like great bargains at first glance, but you often get what you pay for. These mediocre businesses often have less earnings power, meaning there is more reliance on a re-rating to generate good returns - an unlikely scenario for low-quality companies.\n3. Fortrea (FTRE) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nClinical research company Fortrea Holdings (NASDAQ:FTRE) reported Q2 CY2025 results exceeding the market\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 7.2% year on year to $710.3 million. The company\u2019s full-year revenue guidance of $2.65 billion at the midpoint came in 5.7% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.19 per share was significantly above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nFortrea (FTRE) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $710.3 million vs analyst estimates of $634 million (7.2% year-on-year growth, 12% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.19 vs analyst estimates of $0.08 (significant beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $54.9 million vs analyst estimates of $39.62 million (7.7% margin, 38.6% beat)\n- The company lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $2.65 billion at the midpoint from $2.5 billion, a 6% increase\n- EBITDA guidance for the full year is $185 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $175 million\n- Operating Margin: -46.5%, down from -7.7% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 2%, down from 39.6% in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $593.9 million\nCompany Overview\nSpun off from Labcorp in 2023 to focus exclusively on clinical research services, Fortrea (NASDAQ:FTRE) is a contract research organization that helps pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device companies develop and bring their products to market through clinical trials and support services.\nFortrea operates through two main segments: Clinical Services and Enabling Services. The Clinical Services segment, which generates the majority of revenue, provides comprehensive clinical trial management from early-stage (Phase I) through late-stage (Phase IV) studies across more than 20 therapeutic areas including oncology, neurology, rare diseases, and cell and gene therapies.\nThe company's clinical pharmacology capabilities include specialized research units in the U.S. and U.K. with hundreds of beds for conducting early-phase trials. These facilities feature on-site pharmacies that can manufacture both sterile and non-sterile drug products, giving Fortrea significant capabilities in the critical early stages of drug development.\nFor later-stage trials, Fortrea offers flexible engagement models to meet varying client needs. Customers can choose full-service arrangements where Fortrea manages entire clinical programs, functional service provider models where Fortrea supplies specialized staff for specific activities, or hybrid approaches combining elements of both.\nThe Enabling Services segment provides complementary offerings including patient access solutions and technology platforms. The patient access team helps patients navigate insurance coverage and affordability challenges for medications, while technology solutions like the endpoint Clinical platform manage randomization and trial supply logistics.\nFortrea serves a global client base, operating in approximately 90 countries with particular expertise in complex therapeutic areas. A pharmaceutical company developing a novel cancer treatment might engage Fortrea to design and execute clinical trials, manage regulatory submissions, recruit patients, collect and analyze data, and ultimately help secure approval from regulatory agencies like the FDA or EMA.\n4. Drug Development Inputs & Services\nCompanies specializing in drug development inputs and services play a crucial role in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology value chain. Essential support for drug discovery, preclinical testing, and manufacturing means stable demand, as pharmaceutical companies often outsource non-core functions with medium to long-term contracts. However, the business model faces high capital requirements, customer concentration, and vulnerability to shifts in biopharma R&D budgets or regulatory frameworks. Looking ahead, the industry will likely enjoy tailwinds such as increasing investment in biologics, cell and gene therapies, and advancements in precision medicine, which drive demand for sophisticated tools and services. There is a growing trend of outsourcing in drug development for nimbleness and cost efficiency, which benefits the industry. On the flip side, potential headwinds include pricing pressures as efforts to contain healthcare costs are always top of mind. An evolving regulatory backdrop could also slow innovation or client activity.\nFortrea competes with other major contract research organizations including IQVIA (NYSE:IQV), Syneos Health (private), Parexel (private), PPD (owned by Thermo Fisher Scientific, NYSE:TMO), and ICON plc (NASDAQ:ICLR).\n5. Economies of Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith $2.73 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Fortrea has decent scale. This is important as it gives the company more leverage in a heavily regulated, competitive environment that is complex and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Fortrea struggled to consistently generate demand over the last four years as its sales dropped at a 2.9% annual rate. This wasn\u2019t a great result and is a sign of poor business quality.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a stretched historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Fortrea\u2019s annualized revenue declines of 3.6% over the last two years align with its four-year trend, suggesting its demand has consistently shrunk.\nThis quarter, Fortrea reported year-on-year revenue growth of 7.2%, and its $710.3 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 12%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 9.6% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and indicates its products and services will face some demand challenges.\n7. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals.\nFortrea\u2019s high expenses have contributed to an average operating margin of negative 4.8% over the last five years. Unprofitable healthcare companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. It\u2019s hard to trust that the business can endure a full cycle.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Fortrea\u2019s operating margin decreased by 66.2 percentage points over the last five years. The company\u2019s two-year trajectory also shows it failed to get its profitability back to the peak as its margin fell by 39.8 percentage points. This performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows its expenses were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass those costs onto its customers.\nFortrea\u2019s operating margin was negative 46.5% this quarter. The company's consistent lack of profits raise a flag.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nSadly for Fortrea, its EPS declined by 36.5% annually over the last four years, more than its revenue. This tells us the company struggled because its fixed cost base made it difficult to adjust to shrinking demand.\nIn Q2, Fortrea reported adjusted EPS at $0.19, up from negative $0.03 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Fortrea\u2019s full-year EPS of $0.62 to shrink by 3.2%.\n9. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nFortrea has shown mediocre cash profitability over the last five years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 3.1%, subpar for a healthcare business.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Fortrea\u2019s margin dropped by 13 percentage points during that time. This along with its unexciting margin put the company in a tough spot, and shareholders are likely hoping it can reverse course. If the trend continues, it could signal it\u2019s in the middle of a big investment cycle.\nFortrea\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $14.3 million in Q2, equivalent to a 2% margin. The company\u2019s cash profitability regressed as it was 37.6 percentage points lower than in the same quarter last year, suggesting its historical struggles have dragged on.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nFortrea\u2019s five-year average ROIC was negative 10.2%, meaning management lost money while trying to expand the business. Its returns were among the worst in the healthcare sector.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, Fortrea\u2019s ROIC has unfortunately decreased significantly. Paired with its already low returns, these declines suggest its profitable growth opportunities are few and far between.\n11. Balance Sheet Risk\nAs long-term investors, the risk we care about most is the permanent loss of capital, which can happen when a company goes bankrupt or raises money from a disadvantaged position. This is separate from short-term stock price volatility, something we are much less bothered by.\nFortrea burned through $103.1 million of cash over the last year, and its $1.24 billion of debt exceeds the $81.2 million of cash on its balance sheet. This is a deal breaker for us because indebted loss-making companies spell trouble.\nUnless the Fortrea\u2019s fundamentals change quickly, it might find itself in a position where it must raise capital from investors to continue operating. Whether that would be favorable is unclear because dilution is a headwind for shareholder returns.\nWe remain cautious of Fortrea until it generates consistent free cash flow or any of its announced financing plans materialize on its balance sheet.\n12. Key Takeaways from Fortrea\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly Fortrea blew past analysts\u2019 revenue, EPS, and EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also excited it raised its full-year revenue guidance. Zooming out, we think this was a good print with some key areas of upside. The stock traded up 8.4% to $7.13 immediately after reporting.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Fortrea?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 12:03 AM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in Fortrea.\nFortrea doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. To begin with, its revenue has declined over the last four years, and analysts expect its demand to deteriorate over the next 12 months. On top of that, Fortrea\u2019s diminishing returns show management's prior bets haven't worked out, and its relatively low ROIC suggests management has struggled to find compelling investment opportunities.\nFortrea\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 10.6x. This valuation tells us a lot of optimism is priced in - you can find more timely opportunities elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $7.44 on the company (compared to the current share price of $6.24).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

Its decelerating revenue growth and historical cash burn don\u2019t give us much confidence in a potential turnaround.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy iRhythm Is Not Exciting\nPioneering the shift from bulky, short-term heart monitors to sleek, wire-free patches, iRhythm Technologies (NASDAQ:IRTC) provides wearable cardiac monitoring devices and AI-powered analysis services that help physicians detect and diagnose heart rhythm disorders.\n- Persistent adjusted operating margin losses suggest the business manages its expenses poorly\n- Subscale operations are evident in its revenue base of $657.2 million, meaning it has fewer distribution channels than its larger rivals\n- High net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 15\u00d7 increases the risk of forced asset sales or dilutive financing if operational performance weakens\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than iRhythm\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than iRhythm\niRhythm is trading at $161.20 per share, or 74.2x forward EV-to-EBITDA. We consider this valuation aggressive considering the business fundamentals.\nWe prefer to invest in similarly-priced but higher-quality companies with superior earnings growth.\n3. iRhythm (IRTC) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nMedical technology company iRhythm Technologies (NASDAQ:IRTC) reported revenue ahead of Wall Street\u2019s expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales up 26.1% year on year to $186.7 million. The company\u2019s full-year revenue guidance of $725 million at the midpoint came in 4.2% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP loss of $0.32 per share was 32.5% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\niRhythm (IRTC) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $186.7 million vs analyst estimates of $174 million (26.1% year-on-year growth, 7.3% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: -$0.32 vs analyst estimates of -$0.47 (32.5% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $15.7 million vs analyst estimates of $11.82 million (8.4% margin, 32.8% beat)\n- The company lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $725 million at the midpoint from $695 million, a 4.3% increase\n- Operating Margin: -10%, up from -15.5% in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $4.47 billion\nCompany Overview\nPioneering the shift from bulky, short-term heart monitors to sleek, wire-free patches, iRhythm Technologies (NASDAQ:IRTC) provides wearable cardiac monitoring devices and AI-powered analysis services that help physicians detect and diagnose heart rhythm disorders.\nThe company's flagship product is the Zio System, which combines a small, adhesive, water-resistant patch that patients wear for up to 14 days with sophisticated cloud-based analytics. Unlike traditional Holter monitors that typically record for just 24-48 hours and require multiple wires, the Zio patch continuously records every heartbeat without disrupting daily activities, resulting in patient compliance rates of 98-99%.\nWhen a physician prescribes a Zio Service, the patient wears the patch for the prescribed period, during which they can mark symptoms by pressing a button on the device. After the monitoring period, the patch is returned to iRhythm's independent diagnostic testing facility where the data\u2014approximately 1.5 million heartbeats per patient\u2014is uploaded to the cloud and analyzed using the company's FDA-cleared artificial intelligence algorithms.\nCertified cardiographic technicians validate the AI findings before sending a comprehensive report to the prescribing physician. The company offers different monitoring solutions: the Zio Monitor and Zio XT for long-term continuous monitoring, and the Zio AT, which adds real-time transmission capabilities for more urgent cases requiring mobile cardiac telemetry.\niRhythm's business model operates as a healthcare service rather than just a device manufacturer. The company bills insurance companies and Medicare directly for its monitoring services, with approximately 86% of its revenue coming from third-party payers. This integrated approach allows iRhythm to maintain quality control throughout the diagnostic process.\nThe company has expanded its technology platform with the Zio Watch, developed in partnership with Verily (an Alphabet company). This wrist-worn wearable is designed to identify and monitor atrial fibrillation, a common heart rhythm disorder that increases stroke risk. iRhythm is also exploring opportunities to integrate its AI algorithms with other wearable devices.\n4. Patient Monitoring\nPatient monitoring companies within the healthcare equipment industry offer devices and technologies that track chronic conditions and support real-time health management, such as continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and sleep apnea machines. These businesses benefit from recurring revenue from consumables and software subscriptions tied to device sales (razor, razor blade model). The rising prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes and respiratory disorders due to an aging population as well as growing adoption of digitization are good for the industry. However, these companies face challenges from high R&D costs and reliance on regulatory approvals. Looking ahead, the sector is positioned for growth due to tailwinds like the rising burden of chronic diseases from an aging population, the shift toward value-based care, and increased adoption of digital health solutions. Innovations in AI and machine learning are expected to enhance device accuracy and functionality, improving patient outcomes and driving demand. However, there are headwinds such as pricing pressures as healthcare costs are a key focus, especially in the US. An evolving regulatory landscape and competition from more tech-forward new entrants could present additional challenges.\niRhythm's main competitors include BioTelemetry (acquired by Royal Philips), Preventice Solutions (acquired by Boston Scientific), and Bardy Diagnostics (acquired by Baxter International). The company also competes with traditional Holter monitor manufacturers like GE Healthcare, Philips Healthcare, and Welch Allyn (now part of Baxter International).\n5. Revenue Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith just $657.2 million in revenue over the past 12 months, iRhythm is a small company in an industry where scale matters. This makes it difficult to build trust with customers because healthcare is heavily regulated, complex, and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Luckily, iRhythm\u2019s sales grew at an excellent 23.6% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. iRhythm\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 20.6% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand.\nThis quarter, iRhythm reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 26.1%, and its $186.7 million of revenue topped Wall Street estimates by 7.3%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 14.3% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. Despite the slowdown, this projection is commendable and implies the market is baking in success for its products and services.\n7. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals.\niRhythm\u2019s high expenses have contributed to an average operating margin of negative 22.5% over the last five years. Unprofitable healthcare companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. It\u2019s hard to trust that the business can endure a full cycle.\nOn the plus side, iRhythm\u2019s operating margin rose by 3.1 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage. This performance was mostly driven by its recent improvements as the company\u2019s margin has increased by 6.1 percentage points on a two-year basis.\niRhythm\u2019s operating margin was negative 10% this quarter.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\niRhythm\u2019s full-year EPS was flat over the last five years. This performance was underwhelming across the board.\nIn Q2, iRhythm reported adjusted EPS at negative $0.32, up from negative $0.60 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects iRhythm to improve its earnings losses. Analysts forecast its full-year EPS of negative $2.53 will advance to negative $0.80.\n9. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\niRhythm\u2019s demanding reinvestments have consumed many resources over the last five years, contributing to an average free cash flow margin of negative 11.6%. This means it lit $11.57 of cash on fire for every $100 in revenue.\nTaking a step back, an encouraging sign is that iRhythm\u2019s margin expanded by 17.9 percentage points during that time. In light of its glaring cash burn, however, this improvement is a bucket of hot water in a cold ocean.\n10. Balance Sheet Risk\nDebt is a tool that can boost company returns but presents risks if used irresponsibly. As long-term investors, we aim to avoid companies taking excessive advantage of this instrument because it could lead to insolvency.\niRhythm\u2019s $734.7 million of debt exceeds the $545.5 million of cash on its balance sheet. Furthermore, its 15\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio (based on its EBITDA of $12.44 million over the last 12 months) shows the company is overleveraged.\nAt this level of debt, incremental borrowing becomes increasingly expensive and credit agencies could downgrade the company\u2019s rating if profitability falls. iRhythm could also be backed into a corner if the market turns unexpectedly \u2013 a situation we seek to avoid as investors in high-quality companies.\nWe hope iRhythm can improve its balance sheet and remain cautious until it increases its profitability or pays down its debt.\n11. Key Takeaways from iRhythm\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly iRhythm blew past analysts\u2019 EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its revenue outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates by a wide margin. Zooming out, we think this was a good print with some key areas of upside. The stock traded up 8.4% to $152 immediately after reporting.\n12. Is Now The Time To Buy iRhythm?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 12:00 AM EDT\nAre you wondering whether to buy iRhythm or pass? We urge investors to not only consider the latest earnings results but also longer-term business quality and valuation as well.\nFirst off, its revenue growth was impressive over the last five years. And while iRhythm\u2019s operating margins reveal poor profitability compared to other healthcare companies, its rising cash profitability gives it more optionality.\niRhythm\u2019s EV-to-EBITDA ratio based on the next 12 months is 74.2x. All that said, we aren\u2019t investing at the moment because its balance sheet makes us balk. If you\u2019re interested in buying the stock, wait until it generates sufficient cash flows or raises some money.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $178.75 on the company (compared to the current share price of $161.20)."

      "text": "10x Genomics (TXG)\nWe aren\u2019t fans of 10x Genomics. Its negative returns on capital show it destroyed value by losing money on unprofitable business ventures.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think 10x Genomics Will Underperform\nFounded in 2012 by scientists seeking to overcome limitations in traditional biological research methods, 10x Genomics (NASDAQ:TXG) develops instruments, consumables, and software that enable researchers to analyze biological systems at single-cell resolution and spatial context.\n- Historical adjusted operating margin losses point to an inefficient cost structure\n- Cash-burning tendencies make us wonder if it can sustainably generate shareholder value\n- A positive is that its earnings per share grew by 17.4% annually over the last five years, outpacing its peers\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than 10x Genomics\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than 10x Genomics\nAt $12.53 per share, 10x Genomics trades at 2.6x forward price-to-sales. The market typically values companies like 10x Genomics based on their anticipated profits for the next 12 months, but it expects the business to lose money. We also think the upside isn\u2019t great compared to the potential downside here - there are more exciting stocks to buy.\nIt\u2019s better to invest in high-quality businesses with strong long-term earnings potential rather than to buy lower-quality companies with open questions and big downside risks.\n3. 10x Genomics (TXG) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nBiotech company 10x Genomics (NASDAQ:TXG) reported Q2 CY2025 results beating Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 12.9% year on year to $172.9 million. On the other hand, next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance of $142 million was less impressive, coming in 1.5% below analysts\u2019 estimates. Its GAAP profit of $0.28 per share was significantly above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\n10x Genomics (TXG) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $172.9 million vs analyst estimates of $139.5 million (12.9% year-on-year growth, 24% beat)\n- EPS (GAAP): $0.28 vs analyst estimates of -$0.37 (significant beat)\n- Revenue Guidance for Q3 CY2025 is $142 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $144.2 million\n- Operating Margin: 17.4%, up from -27.3% in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $1.58 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded in 2012 by scientists seeking to overcome limitations in traditional biological research methods, 10x Genomics (NASDAQ:TXG) develops instruments, consumables, and software that enable researchers to analyze biological systems at single-cell resolution and spatial context.\n10x Genomics' technology platforms allow scientists to examine the complexity of biology with unprecedented detail and scale. The company's solutions are built on expertise across multiple disciplines including chemistry, biology, microfluidics, hardware engineering, and computational software.\nThe company offers three main technology platforms. The Chromium platform enables high-throughput analysis of individual biological components by partitioning samples into millions of microscopic reaction chambers, allowing researchers to analyze single cells in detail. The Visium platform provides spatial analysis, showing where biological components are located within tissue samples, creating visual maps of gene expression across tissues. The Xenium platform performs in situ analysis, detecting RNA directly within tissue sections without requiring conventional sequencing.\nThese platforms are used by researchers to make discoveries in oncology, immunology, neuroscience, and other fields. For example, cancer researchers might use 10x technology to identify rare cell types within tumors that could influence treatment response, while immunologists might map immune cell interactions to develop more effective therapies.\nThe company's business model involves selling instruments that run exclusively with its proprietary consumables and software. A typical customer workflow begins with sample preparation, followed by processing on one of 10x's instruments, then analysis using the company's software. For instance, a neuroscience researcher studying Alzheimer's disease might use the Visium platform to visualize gene expression changes across brain tissue sections, revealing which regions show early disease markers.\n10x Genomics primarily serves academic institutions, government research labs, and biopharmaceutical companies worldwide. The company maintains a direct sales force in North America and parts of Europe, while working with distribution partners in Asia and other regions.\n4. Genomics & Sequencing\nGenomics and sequencing companies within the life sciences industry provide the technology for increasingly personalized medicine, drug discovery, and disease research. These firms leverage cutting-edge platforms for high-throughput sequencing and genomic analysis, enabling researchers and healthcare providers to better understand genetic underpinnings of diseases. While the industry enjoys high barriers to entry due to proprietary technology and intellectual property, the business model also faces significant R&D costs, reliance on continued innovation, and exposure to shifts in academic, biotech, and clinical research funding. Over the next few years, the subsector is well-positioned to benefit from tailwinds such as increasing adoption of precision medicine, expanded applications for sequencing technologies in areas like oncology and rare disease diagnostics, and growing use of genomic data in drug development. Advances in artificial intelligence could further enhance the speed and accuracy of genomic insights. However, potential headwinds include price sensitivity among research institutions and healthcare systems that are constantly trying to contain and lower costs. Additionally, regulations around data privacy and genomic testing are not yet set in stone, adding uncertainty to the industry.\n10x Genomics competes with NanoString Technologies (NASDAQ:NSTG), Bio-Rad Laboratories (NYSE:BIO), Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), and Akoya Biosciences (NASDAQ:AKYA) in the spatial biology and single-cell analysis markets. The company also faces competition from emerging private companies like Parse Biosciences and Vizgen.\n5. Revenue Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith just $644.5 million in revenue over the past 12 months, 10x Genomics is a small company in an industry where scale matters. This makes it difficult to build trust with customers because healthcare is heavily regulated, complex, and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nExamining a company\u2019s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Over the last five years, 10x Genomics grew its sales at an impressive 20.7% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. 10x Genomics\u2019s recent performance shows its demand has slowed significantly as its annualized revenue growth of 6.5% over the last two years was well below its five-year trend.\nWe can dig further into the company\u2019s revenue dynamics by analyzing its most important segment, Consumables. Over the last two years, 10x Genomics\u2019s Consumables revenue (recurring orders) averaged 3.7% year-on-year growth. This segment has lagged the company\u2019s overall sales.\nThis quarter, 10x Genomics reported year-on-year revenue growth of 12.9%, and its $172.9 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 24%. Company management is currently guiding for a 6.4% year-on-year decline in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 7.6% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and indicates its products and services will face some demand challenges.\n7. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals.\nAlthough 10x Genomics was profitable this quarter from an operational perspective, it\u2019s generally struggled over a longer time period. Its expensive cost structure has contributed to an average operating margin of negative 42.4% over the last five years. Unprofitable healthcare companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. It\u2019s hard to trust that the business can endure a full cycle.\nOn the plus side, 10x Genomics\u2019s operating margin rose over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage. Zooming in on its more recent performance, we can see the company\u2019s trajectory is intact as its margin has also increased by 15.8 percentage points on a two-year basis.\nThis quarter, 10x Genomics generated an operating margin profit margin of 17.4%, up 44.7 percentage points year on year. This increase was a welcome development and shows it was more efficient.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nAlthough 10x Genomics\u2019s full-year earnings are still negative, it reduced its losses and improved its EPS by 7.4% annually over the last five years. The next few quarters will be critical for assessing its long-term profitability.\nIn Q2, 10x Genomics reported EPS at $0.28, up from negative $0.32 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects 10x Genomics to perform poorly. Analysts forecast its full-year EPS of negative $0.70 will tumble to negative $1.01.\n9. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\n10x Genomics\u2019s demanding reinvestments have drained its resources over the last five years, putting it in a pinch and limiting its ability to return capital to investors. Its free cash flow margin averaged negative 20.7%, meaning it lit $20.68 of cash on fire for every $100 in revenue.\nTaking a step back, an encouraging sign is that 10x Genomics\u2019s margin expanded by 95.1 percentage points during that time. In light of its glaring cash burn, however, this improvement is a bucket of hot water in a cold ocean.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\n10x Genomics\u2019s five-year average ROIC was negative 50.9%, meaning management lost money while trying to expand the business. Its returns were among the worst in the healthcare sector.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, 10x Genomics\u2019s ROIC averaged 2.7 percentage point increases each year. This is a good sign, and we hope the company can continue improving.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nCompanies with more cash than debt have lower bankruptcy risk.\n10x Genomics is a well-capitalized company with $447.3 million of cash and $86.74 million of debt on its balance sheet. This $360.5 million net cash position is 23.8% of its market cap and gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n12. Key Takeaways from 10x Genomics\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly 10x Genomics blew past analysts\u2019 EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its revenue outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates by a wide margin. On the other hand, its revenue guidance for next quarter missed. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock traded up 7.9% to $13.79 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy 10x Genomics?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 12:07 AM EDT\nWhen considering an investment in 10x Genomics, investors should account for its valuation and business qualities as well as what\u2019s happened in the latest quarter.\n10x Genomics isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it isn\u2019t one of our picks. Although its revenue growth was impressive over the last five years, it\u2019s expected to deteriorate over the next 12 months and its relatively low ROIC suggests management has struggled to find compelling investment opportunities. And while the company\u2019s rising cash profitability gives it more optionality, the downside is its operating margins reveal poor profitability compared to other healthcare companies.\n10x Genomics\u2019s forward price-to-sales ratio is 2.6x. The market typically values companies like 10x Genomics based on their anticipated profits for the next 12 months, but it expects the business to lose money. We also think the upside isn\u2019t great compared to the potential downside here - there are more exciting stocks to buy.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $15 on the company (compared to the current share price of $12.53).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

Summary\nWhy We Think Tandem Diabetes Will Underperform\nWith technology that automatically adjusts insulin delivery based on continuous glucose monitoring data, Tandem Diabetes Care (NASDAQ:TNDM) develops and manufactures automated insulin delivery systems that help people with diabetes manage their blood glucose levels.\n- Incremental sales over the last five years were much less profitable as its earnings per share fell by 21% annually while its revenue grew\n- Negative returns on capital show that some of its growth strategies have backfired\n- Short cash runway increases the probability of a capital raise that dilutes existing shareholders\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Tandem Diabetes\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Tandem Diabetes\nTandem Diabetes\u2019s stock price of $10.52 implies a valuation ratio of 12.6x forward EV-to-EBITDA. This multiple is high given its weaker fundamentals.\nPaying a premium for high-quality companies with strong long-term earnings potential is preferable to owning challenged businesses with questionable prospects. That helps the prudent investor sleep well at night.\n3. Tandem Diabetes (TNDM) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nDiabetes technology company Tandem Diabetes Care (NASDAQ:TNDM) reported Q2 CY2025 results beating Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 8.5% year on year to $240.7 million. The company expects the full year\u2019s revenue to be around $1 billion, close to analysts\u2019 estimates. Its GAAP loss of $0.78 per share was significantly below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nTandem Diabetes (TNDM) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $240.7 million vs analyst estimates of $237.1 million (8.5% year-on-year growth, 1.5% beat)\n- EPS (GAAP): -$0.78 vs analyst estimates of -$0.39 (significant miss)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: -$1.85 million vs analyst estimates of $2.34 million (-0.8% margin, significant miss)\n- The company reconfirmed its revenue guidance for the full year of $1 billion at the midpoint\n- Operating Margin: -21.5%, down from -13.9% in the same quarter last year\n- Sales Volumes rose 5% year on year, in line with the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $1.01 billion\nCompany Overview\nWith technology that automatically adjusts insulin delivery based on continuous glucose monitoring data, Tandem Diabetes Care (NASDAQ:TNDM) develops and manufactures automated insulin delivery systems that help people with diabetes manage their blood glucose levels.\nTandem's flagship products include the t:slim X2 insulin pump and the newer, smaller Tandem Mobi system. Both devices feature the company's Control-IQ technology, an advanced hybrid closed-loop system that automatically adjusts insulin delivery based on readings from compatible continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). This technology helps users maintain their blood glucose within target ranges by increasing, decreasing, or suspending insulin delivery as needed, and can even deliver automatic correction doses when glucose levels rise too high.\nThe company's pumps are designed with user experience in mind, featuring touchscreen interfaces, Bluetooth connectivity, and software that can be updated remotely through a personal computer. This allows users to access new features without replacing their hardware. For example, existing t:slim X2 users can update their pumps to integrate with newer CGM sensors as they become available.\nTandem's revenue comes primarily from selling insulin pumps and the disposable supplies needed to use them, including insulin cartridges and infusion sets that need to be replaced every few days. A patient might use a Tandem pump to manage their diabetes by wearing the device (about the size of a small smartphone for the t:slim X2 or a car key fob for the Mobi), which delivers insulin through a thin tube connected to an infusion set attached to their body.\nThe company has expanded its CGM integration partnerships to include both Dexcom and Abbott sensors, giving patients more options for customizing their diabetes management systems. Tandem also offers digital tools like the Tandem Source data management platform, which allows users and healthcare providers to visualize diabetes data and identify trends.\nBeyond its current product lineup, Tandem is developing new innovations including a tubeless patch pump option, extended-wear infusion sets, and enhancements to its Control-IQ algorithm. The company is also working to expand its addressable market by conducting clinical trials to support the use of its technology in people with type 2 diabetes who require intensive insulin therapy.\n4. Healthcare Technology for Patients\nThe consumer-focused healthcare technology sector leverages digital platforms to make healthcare more accessible and affordable, offering services like telemedicine and prescription discounts. Looking forward, growth is supported by increasing consumer comfort with telehealth and the demand for cost-saving tools amidst rising healthcare expenses. AI-powered diagnostics and personalized digital care also present significant opportunities. However, the sector faces headwinds from heightened competition as large technology and established healthcare companies expand their digital presence.\nTandem Diabetes Care competes with Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), which makes the tubeless Omnipod insulin delivery system, Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), a medical device giant with a diabetes division that produces insulin pumps, and privately-held Ypsomed, a European medical technology company that manufactures insulin pumps and injection systems.\n5. Revenue Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith just $1.00 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Tandem Diabetes is a small company in an industry where scale matters. This makes it difficult to build trust with customers because healthcare is heavily regulated, complex, and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Thankfully, Tandem Diabetes\u2019s 19.5% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was impressive. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Tandem Diabetes\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 12.4% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand.\nTandem Diabetes also reports its number of pump shipments, which reached 21,000 in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, Tandem Diabetes\u2019s pump shipments averaged 2.9% year-on-year growth. Because this number is lower than its revenue growth, we can see the company benefited from price increases.\nThis quarter, Tandem Diabetes reported year-on-year revenue growth of 8.5%, and its $240.7 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 1.5%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 4.8% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection is underwhelming and suggests its products and services will see some demand headwinds.\n7. Adjusted Operating Margin\nTandem Diabetes\u2019s high expenses have contributed to an average adjusted operating margin of negative 7.9% over the last five years. Unprofitable healthcare companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. It\u2019s hard to trust that the business can endure a full cycle.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Tandem Diabetes\u2019s adjusted operating margin decreased by 15.6 percentage points over the last five years. The company\u2019s two-year trajectory also shows it failed to get its profitability back to the peak as its margin fell by 1.6 percentage points. This performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows its expenses were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass those costs onto its customers.\nTandem Diabetes\u2019s adjusted operating margin was negative 13.2% this quarter.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nTandem Diabetes\u2019s earnings losses deepened over the last five years as its EPS dropped 34.2% annually. We tend to steer our readers away from companies with falling EPS, where diminishing earnings could imply changing secular trends and preferences. If the tide turns unexpectedly, Tandem Diabetes\u2019s low margin of safety could leave its stock price susceptible to large downswings.\nIn Q2, Tandem Diabetes reported EPS at negative $0.78, down from negative $0.47 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Tandem Diabetes to improve its earnings losses. Analysts forecast its full-year EPS of negative $3.09 will advance to negative $1.00.\n9. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nTandem Diabetes has shown mediocre cash profitability over the last five years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 1.5%, subpar for a healthcare business.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Tandem Diabetes\u2019s margin dropped by 9.1 percentage points during that time. Almost any movement in the wrong direction is undesirable because of its already low cash conversion. If the trend continues, it could signal it\u2019s in the middle of a big investment cycle.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nTandem Diabetes\u2019s five-year average ROIC was negative 19.7%, meaning management lost money while trying to expand the business. Its returns were among the worst in the healthcare sector.\n11. Balance Sheet Risk\nDebt is a tool that can boost company returns but presents risks if used irresponsibly. As long-term investors, we aim to avoid companies taking excessive advantage of this instrument because it could lead to insolvency.\nTandem Diabetes posted negative $267,000 of EBITDA over the last 12 months, and its $449 million of debt exceeds the $315.4 million of cash on its balance sheet. This is a deal breaker for us because indebted loss-making companies spell trouble.\nWe implore our readers to tread carefully because credit agencies could downgrade Tandem Diabetes if its unprofitable ways continue, making incremental borrowing more expensive and restricting growth prospects. The company could also be backed into a corner if the market turns unexpectedly. We hope Tandem Diabetes can improve its profitability and remain cautious until then.\n12. Key Takeaways from Tandem Diabetes\u2019s Q2 Results\nIt was encouraging to see Tandem Diabetes beat analysts\u2019 revenue expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its EPS missed and its sales volume fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, this was a softer quarter. The stock traded down 17% to $12 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Tandem Diabetes?\nUpdated: August 11, 2025 at 11:28 PM EDT\nBefore deciding whether to buy Tandem Diabetes or pass, we urge investors to consider business quality, valuation, and the latest quarterly results.\nTandem Diabetes falls short of our quality standards. Although its revenue growth was impressive over the last five years, it\u2019s expected to deteriorate over the next 12 months and its relatively low ROIC suggests management has struggled to find compelling investment opportunities. On top of that, the company\u2019s declining EPS over the last five years makes it a less attractive asset to the public markets.\nTandem Diabetes\u2019s EV-to-EBITDA ratio based on the next 12 months is 12.6x. This valuation tells us a lot of optimism is priced in - you can find more timely opportunities elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $22.95 on the company (compared to the current share price of $10.52).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

Summary\nWhy agilon health Is Not Exciting\nTransforming how doctors care for seniors by shifting financial incentives from volume to outcomes, agilon health (NYSE:AGL) provides a platform that helps primary care physicians transition to value-based care models for Medicare patients through long-term partnerships and global capitation arrangements.\n- Negative returns on capital show management lost money while trying to expand the business\n- Suboptimal cost structure is highlighted by its history of adjusted operating margin losses\n- On the plus side, its annual revenue growth of 38% over the last five years was superb and indicates its market share increased during this cycle\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than agilon health\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than agilon health\nagilon health is trading at $0.84 per share, or 0.1x forward price-to-sales. The market typically values companies like agilon health based on their anticipated profits for the next 12 months, but it expects the business to lose money. We also think the upside isn\u2019t great compared to the potential downside here - there are more exciting stocks to buy.\nIt\u2019s better to pay up for high-quality businesses with strong long-term earnings potential rather than buy lower-quality stocks because they appear cheap. These challenged businesses often don\u2019t re-rate, a phenomenon known as a \u201cvalue trap\u201d.\n3. agilon health (AGL) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nHealthcare services company Agilon Health (NYSE:AGL) missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales falling 5.9% year on year to $1.39 billion. Its GAAP loss of $0.25 per share was significantly below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nagilon health (AGL) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $1.39 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.47 billion (5.9% year-on-year decline, 5.2% miss)\n- EPS (GAAP): -$0.25 vs analyst estimates of -$0.12 (significant miss)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: -$83.33 million vs analyst estimates of -$28.52 million (-6% margin, significant miss)\n- Operating Margin: -8.3%, down from -2.9% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow was -$38.34 million compared to -$22.03 million in the same quarter last year\n- Customers: 497,500, up from 491,000 in the previous quarter\n- Market Capitalization: $751.3 million\nCompany Overview\nTransforming how doctors care for seniors by shifting financial incentives from volume to outcomes, agilon health (NYSE:AGL) provides a platform that helps primary care physicians transition to value-based care models for Medicare patients through long-term partnerships and global capitation arrangements.\nAt the core of agilon's business model is a fundamental shift in how healthcare is delivered and paid for. Rather than the traditional fee-for-service approach where physicians are paid for each service provided, agilon enables doctors to receive fixed monthly payments (called \"global capitation\") for managing the total healthcare needs of Medicare patients. This aligns financial incentives with keeping patients healthy rather than simply treating illnesses.\nThe company forms risk-bearing entities in local communities that contract with health insurers, then partners with established physician groups through 20-year agreements. These physician partners gain access to agilon's technology platform, operational support, and capital needed to succeed under value-based care arrangements.\nFor example, a primary care practice in Ohio partnering with agilon might receive a set monthly payment for each Medicare Advantage patient in their care. The practice then becomes responsible for coordinating all aspects of that patient's healthcare\u2014from preventive screenings to specialist referrals to hospital admissions\u2014with financial incentives to improve outcomes while managing costs.\nagilon generates revenue through these per-member-per-month payments from health insurers. The company's platform includes technology for data analysis, care coordination tools, and operational support to help physicians identify high-risk patients, close care gaps, and optimize care delivery.\nBeyond Medicare Advantage, agilon also participates in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' ACO REACH Model through eight Accountable Care Organizations, allowing physician partners to apply similar value-based approaches to traditional Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries.\nThe company has expanded its geographic footprint across multiple states including Ohio, Connecticut, Maine, Michigan, Texas, and others, creating a network of physician partners who can share best practices and insights across communities.\n4. Outpatient & Specialty Care\nThe outpatient and specialty care industry delivers targeted medical services in non-hospital settings that are often cost-effective compared to inpatient alternatives. This means that they are more desired as rising healthcare costs and ways to combat them become more and more top-of-mind. Outpatient and specialty care providers boast revenue streams that are stable due to the recurring nature of treatment for chronic conditions and long-term patient relationships. However, their reliance on government reimbursement programs like Medicare means stroke-of-the-pen risk. Additionally, scaling a network of facilities can be capital-intensive with uneven return profiles amid competition from integrated healthcare systems. Looking ahead, the industry is positioned to grow as demand for outpatient services expands, driven by aging populations, a rising prevalence of chronic diseases, and a shift toward value-based care models. Tailwinds include advancements in medical technology that support more complex procedures in outpatient settings and the increasing focus on preventive care, which can be aided by data and AI. However, headwinds such as reimbursement rate cuts, labor shortages, and the financial strain of digitization may temper growth.\nagilon health competes with other companies focused on value-based primary care models including Oak Street Health (acquired by CVS Health), Privia Health (NASDAQ: PRVA), VillageMD (majority-owned by Walgreens Boots Alliance), and privately-held companies like Iora Health (acquired by One Medical/Amazon) and Aledade.\n5. Economies of Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith $5.90 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, agilon health has decent scale. This is important as it gives the company more leverage in a heavily regulated, competitive environment that is complex and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Thankfully, agilon health\u2019s 38% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. agilon health\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 31.1% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand.\nWe can dig further into the company\u2019s revenue dynamics by analyzing its number of customers, which reached 497,500 in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, agilon health\u2019s customer base averaged 29% year-on-year growth. Because this number is lower than its revenue growth, we can see the average customer spent more money each year on the company\u2019s products and services.\nThis quarter, agilon health missed Wall Street\u2019s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 5.9% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $1.39 billion of revenue.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 6.1% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. Despite the slowdown, this projection is above the sector average and implies the market is baking in some success for its newer products and services.\n7. Operating Margin\nagilon health\u2019s high expenses have contributed to an average operating margin of negative 6.7% over the last five years. Unprofitable healthcare companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. It\u2019s hard to trust that the business can endure a full cycle.\nOn the plus side, agilon health\u2019s operating margin rose by 16.9 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage. Zooming into its more recent performance, however, we can see the company\u2019s margin has decreased by 2.7 percentage points on a two-year basis. If agilon health wants to pass our bar, it must prove it can expand its profitability consistently.\nThis quarter, agilon health generated a negative 8.3% operating margin.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nagilon health\u2019s earnings losses deepened over the last five years as its EPS dropped 24.5% annually. We\u2019ll keep a close eye on the company as diminishing earnings could imply changing secular trends and preferences.\nIn Q2, agilon health reported EPS at negative $0.25, down from negative $0.07 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street is optimistic. Analysts forecast agilon health\u2019s full-year EPS of negative $0.77 will reach break even.\n9. Cash Is King\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nagilon health\u2019s demanding reinvestments have consumed many resources over the last five years, contributing to an average free cash flow margin of negative 3.5%. This means it lit $3.46 of cash on fire for every $100 in revenue.\nTaking a step back, an encouraging sign is that agilon health\u2019s margin expanded by 5.2 percentage points during that time. We have no doubt shareholders would like to continue seeing its cash conversion rise.\nagilon health burned through $38.34 million of cash in Q2, equivalent to a negative 2.7% margin. The company\u2019s cash burn was similar to its $22.03 million of lost cash in the same quarter last year.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nagilon health\u2019s five-year average ROIC was negative 68.5%, meaning management lost money while trying to expand the business. Its returns were among the worst in the healthcare sector.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nOne of the best ways to mitigate bankruptcy risk is to hold more cash than debt.\nagilon health is a well-capitalized company with $327 million of cash and $34.95 million of debt on its balance sheet. This $292.1 million net cash position is 38.9% of its market cap and gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n12. Key Takeaways from agilon health\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe struggled to find many positives in these results. Its revenue missed and its EPS fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The stock traded down 26.2% to $1.34 immediately after reporting.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy agilon health?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 12:32 AM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in agilon health.\nagilon health isn\u2019t a bad business, but we\u2019re not clamoring to buy it here and now. First off, its revenue growth was exceptional over the last five years. And while agilon health\u2019s relatively low ROIC suggests management has struggled to find compelling investment opportunities, its customer growth has been marvelous.\nagilon health\u2019s forward price-to-sales ratio is 0.1x. The market typically values companies like agilon health based on their anticipated profits for the next 12 months, but it expects the business to lose money. We also think the upside isn\u2019t great compared to the potential downside here - there are more exciting stocks to buy.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $2.11 on the company (compared to the current share price of $0.84)."
