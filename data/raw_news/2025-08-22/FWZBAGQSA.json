  "title": "FLA launches toolkit to strengthen worker grievance mechanisms",
  "description": "Non-profit Fair Labor Association (FLA) has introduced a toolkit aimed to help companies with the creation and management of effective grievance systems.",
  "content": "This initiative aims to enhance worker representation and address labour issues within global supply chains.\n\nFLA's toolkit serves as a practical guide, providing a step-by-step approach to developing, implementing, and evaluating grievance mechanisms. It includes an Excel audit tool and a troubleshooting checklist for additional support.\n\nThe toolkit focuses on key areas, outlines common challenges, shares best practices, and discusses the business case for effective grievance mechanisms. It also features case studies, field examples, and direct quotes to provide practical insights.\n\nDivided into two main sections \u2013 Informational and Operational, the toolkit addresses the diverse needs of companies at different stages of developing and implementing their grievance mechanisms.\n\nGrievance mechanisms are formalised with internal dispute resolution processes available to individuals and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), including unions.\n\nFor factories, these mechanisms help in identifying, preventing, and remedying worker issues, ensuring that workers' voices are heard within the workplace.\n\nFLA president and CEO Jeff Vockrodt said: \u201cGrievance mechanisms are critical not only to protecting workers, but also to safeguarding a company\u2019s reputation with consumers and investors. However, many brands and suppliers struggle to fully implement them. Our new toolkit will help companies establish trusted grievance processes that demonstrate that labour rights concerns are taken seriously and resolved quickly.\u201d\n\nTo further facilitate understanding and application of the toolkit, FLA will host a public webinar on 4 September.\n\nIn May, the FLA in collaboration with human rights consultancy Impactt, published a report identifying several issues within Brazil's leather supply chain. The report pointed out a deficiency in transparency and potential risks to human rights.\n\n\"FLA launches toolkit to strengthen worker grievance mechanisms\" was originally created and published by Just Style, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\n\n The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.
