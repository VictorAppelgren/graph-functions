  "content": "Toward the end of an extensive interview with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, MSNBC's Eugene Robinson was afforded an opportunity to question the Donald official and put him on the spot over the tariffs . After making a pitch to co-host Joe Scarborough that the tariffs should soon increase employment numbers, Robinson asked Bessent, \"Mr. Secretary, there's one question I've got to ask you, because there has been some confusion. So we've got a tariff of, what, 50 percent on Brazil now, I think. And so if someone here, an importer wants to buy Brazilian products today or tomorrow and import them, they're going to pay 50 percent to the Treasury. And so who writes that check?\" \"Well, it's a couple of things,\" the Trump Cabinet member replied. \"First, we could have substitutions. So there's very little that only comes from Brazil, you know that it could it could come from Argentina. It could come from \u2013\u2013.\" \"Right,\" Robinson interrupted. \"But assuming it does come from Brazil, say, or it comes from any country with a tariff, who writes the check to the treasury?\" \"Well, the check is written to the person who receives it at the dock in the U.S.,\" Bessent tentatively answered. \"Ummhmm, the check is written by the person who receives it at the dock. So tariff is paid in this country by the importer, is that right?\" the smiling Robinson persisted. \"But the Brazilian exporter could decide that they want to keep market share,\" Bessent protested. \"They could lower their price so that the full 50 percent of the tariff, say, and \u2013\u2013.\" \"You're right, they can eat part of the cost,\" Robinson interjected. \"What is what we've seen,\" Bessent offered. \"Okay, okay, but the check is written by the importer right at the dock?\" Robinson asked once again. \"Yeah, and then, you know, the importer can pass it on or not,\" the Trump official blandly suggested.",

Bessents explained that substitutions, such as Brazil, Argentina, or Argentina, could occur. Robinson continued questioning him, suggesting that the tariffs could increase employment numbers but also lower their price to maintain market share. Bessant responded by suggesting that Brazilian exporters could lower their prices to offset the full 50 percent of the tariff. Robinson responded by saying that the importer can pass on the cost or decide if the tariff can be reduced.",

      "text": "In a recent op-ed for Religion News Service, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Sean Rowe, wrote that the church is experiencing a \u201clong-overdue reckoning\u201d on its proximity to political power.\nRowe also said that what was \u201conce the church of the Founding Fathers and presidents\u201d is today \u201cless known for the powerful people in our pews than for our resistance to the rising tide of authoritarianism and Christian nationalism emanating from Washington, D.C.\u201d\nFor Whatley, that might have made for uncomfortable reading.\nNow chair of the Republican National Committee, having led the North Carolina Republican Party, he said in a 2023 podcast interview it was \u201ca personal mission of mine\u201d and \u201ca really big deal\u201d to get people of faith into politics.\nHe added that he serves as the treasurer for his church, and previously served as a senior warden on the vestry.\nBut even that church has taken stances seemingly at odds with Whatley\u2019s embrace of Trump.\nSt. Mark\u2019s Episcopal Church in Gastonia describes itself as \u201ca progressive parish\u201d whose members volunteer for programs \u201cto combat hunger, homelessness, racism and other significant issues.\u201d\nThe St. Mark\u2019s website notes that the Episcopal Church embraces \u201cinclusion,\u201d and that \u201cpeople of all genders and sexual orientations serve as bishops, priests, and deacons in our church.\u201d\nThe church\u2019s donations page bears Whatley\u2019s name, as stewardship chair, along with those of the rector and senior warden. A post on the St. Mark\u2019s Facebook page, meanwhile, shows that Whatley delivered the \u201cmessage\u201d during \u201cservices\u201d at the church in September 2020.\nWhatley could not be reached for comment, either through his campaign or the Republican National Committee.\nBut Robert Orr, a former associate judge on the North Carolina Supreme Court and former Republican candidate for governor who is also a member of the Episcopal Church, told Raw Story he believes \u201call the basic tenets of Christianity are completely at odds with the policies being imposed by the Trump administration.\u201d\nOrr cited decisions to cut funding for school lunches, to end humanitarian aid to poor countries by shutting down the U.S. Agency for International Development, and to \u201cturn a blind eye to the humanitarian devastation going on in Gaza.\u201d\n\u201cI think that those who are in lockstep with Mr. Trump have an obligation to explain how those kinds of policies are not inconsistent with the teaching that you hear on Sunday in your Episcopal church, your Baptist church, or your synagogue,\u201d said Orr, whose alienation from the Republican Party began during the 2016 election before he switched his voter registration to unaffiliated following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\u2018Intertwined and inseparable\u2019\nThe intertwining of faith and politics has undoubtedly been a central theme of Whatley\u2019s life.\nIn the 1990s, he earned a master\u2019s degree in religion from Wake Forest University, then a joint degree in law and theology from Notre Dame. The Assembly reported that Whatley\u2019s dissertation \u201ccentered on the Roman Empire\u2019s occupation of Palestine just before and after the time of Christ,\u201d in which he wrote that \u201creligious and political power were intertwined and inseparable.\u201d\nContemplating faith, Whatley also pursued politics.\nAs a sophomore at Watauga High School in Boone, N.C., he volunteered for the 1984 Senate reelection campaign of the Republican Jesse Helms \u2014 a hardline conservative leader.\nAfter clerking for a federal judge in Charlotte, in 2000 Whatley volunteered for the Republican candidate George W. Bush\u2019s recount effort in Florida, key to Bush\u2019s presidential election win over the Democrat Al Gore.\nFollowing stints working for the Bush administration, the staff of then North Carolina Sen. Elizabeth Dole, and an oil and gas lobbying firm, Whatley was elected chair of the North Carolina Republican Party in 2019.\nIn 2021, following Jan. 6, the state party censured then Sen. Richard Burr for voting to impeach Trump for inciting an insurrection. In early 2024, as Trump was locking up the Republican nomination, he backed Whatley to chair the national committee.\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) retired after opposing Donald Trump. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz\nThe current North Carolina Senate race is to replace Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican who announced his retirement after opposing Trump\u2019s package of tax cuts and slashed domestic spending, known as the \u201cbig beautiful bill.\u201d\nWhen Whatley formally launched his campaign in Gastonia on July 31, his loyalty to Trump took center stage.\nSix days earlier, Trump issued a \u201ccomplete and total endorsement\u201d on Truth Social, all but assuring Whatley\u2019s victory in next year\u2019s primary.\nTrump wrote: \u201cI need him in Washington, and I need him representing you!\u201d\nIn his kickoff speech, Whatley thanked Trump for his \u201cvision\u201d and \u201cleadership,\u201d while pledging to support Trump\u2019s \u201cefforts to deport violent criminal illegal aliens.\u201d\nThe Rev. Shawn Griffith, Whatley\u2019s pastor at St. Mark\u2019s, gave a nonpartisan invocation, asking for God\u2019s blessing on Whatley and his family.\n\u201cWe pray that you give Michael wisdom in seeking your will in the decisions he will face,\u201d Griffith said. \u201cWe pray that you give him strength and courage to choose and do the right things rather than those that are popular.\u201d\nWhatley\u2019s 18-minute speech eschewed religion, referencing Trump nine times. The word \u201cfaith\u201d received zero mentions.\nWhatley said he would champion \u201cNorth Carolina values,\u201d which he enumerated as \u201ca healthy, robust economy, safe kids and communities, and a strong America.\u201d\nWhatley hasn\u2019t always shied away from faith in the political sphere.\nIn Charlotte in 2022, addressing the Salt & Light Conference \u2014 hosted by the Faith & Freedom Coalition, led by longtime political strategist Ralph Reed \u2014 Whatley said: \u201cI work hard every day to make sure the North Carolina Republican Party is going to be the party of faith \u2026 I pray that I can use this platform that I\u2019ve been given by the voters of North Carolina, and the Republicans of North Carolina to be an instrument of God.\u201d\nThat year, Whatley teamed up with Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson to speak at a series of pastor luncheons hosted by the American Renewal Project, an organization the Southern Poverty Law Center has linked to an anti-LGBTQ agenda.\nRobinson wound up badly losing his 2024 bid for governor after CNN reported that he had described himself as a \u201cBlack Nazi\u201d on a pornographic website.\nDuring a December 2023 interview for a podcast hosted by Clearview Church in Henderson, N.C., Whatley said he had appeared at \u201c30 different pastor lunches across the state\u201d and spoken to 4,000 pastors.\n\u201cWe talk about how to win elections for faith, not Republican versus Democrat,\u201d Whatley said. \u201cThis is good versus evil. How do we get everybody to engage on this? Because I can assure you liberal churches are engaged. How do you get the evangelicals and other conservative churches to engage?\u201d\nWhatley said then it was imperative to recruit \u201cmoral\u201d people to run for office, because \u201cI\u2019ve never seen someone who became a more moral person after they got elected.\u201d\nSix months into the second Trump administration, Whatley\u2019s church is moving faith into the public square.\nOne day after the inauguration, the Rt. Rev. Marian Edgar Budde, the Episcopal bishop for the Diocese of Washington, D.C. directly pleaded with Trump to \u201chave mercy\u201d on \u201cgay, lesbian and transgender children in both Republican and Democratic families who fear for their lives.\u201d\nBudde went on to admonish Trump that while some \u201cmay not be citizens or have the proper documentation, the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals.\u201d\nBishop Mariann Edgar Budde speaks to Donald Trump and his political flock (Photo: Screen capture via National Cathedral video)\nThe following month, the Episcopal Church joined more than two dozen Christian and Jewish groups in filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration\u2019s move to give immigration enforcement agents more latitude to make arrests at houses of worship.\nIn May, the Episcopal Church terminated a partnership with the federal government to provide refugee resettlement services, in response to Trump\u2019s move to classify white Afrikaners as refugees based on the discredited claim that they face racial discrimination in South Africa.\nMost recently, the Episcopal Diocese of New York hired a lawyer to free a South Korean university student whose mother serves a priest in the diocese from ICE detention.\nOrr told Raw Story the apparent drop-off in Republican rhetoric on religion since the 2024 election reflects \u201ca political purpose.\u201d\nVoters who helped elect Trump in response to appeals to their faith, Orr said, \u201cwere used in a cynical way to exploit their beliefs on social issues and conservative flashpoints.\u201d"

      "text": "President Donald Trump ushered in the implementation of his so-called reciprocal tariffs early Thursday at midnight, proclaiming that \u201cbillions of dollars in tariffs are now flowing into the United States\u201d as a federal court continues to litigate Trump\u2019s authority to impose them.\n\u201cBillions of dollars, largely from countries that have taken advantage of the United States for many years, laughing all the way, will start flowing into the USA,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \u201cThe only thing that can stop America\u2019s greatness would be a radical left court that wants to see our country fail!\u201d\nThe question of whether a president has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs is currently being tested in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\nWhile Congress historically holds the authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations, Trump has defended his authority to impose tariffs citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which expands the president\u2019s authority as it relates to sanctions and trade under circumstances where there exists an \u201cunusual and extraordinary threat.\u201d That threat, Trump has said, has been the United States\u2019 trade imbalances.\nWhether Trump\u2019s position is validated by the federal court remains to be seen, though some experts argue Trump\u2019s argument is a losing one.\nMarkets largely remained stable, however, as the wave of tariffs went into effect, whereas the value of the U.S. dollar dipped slightly."
