      "summary": "The U.S. stock market is now more concentrated than ever, with the top 10 S&P 500 stocks accounting for about 40% of the index, largely dominated by tech firms. Morningstar’s Dominic Pappalardo warns that a weak earnings report from one or two of these tech names could trigger a broad sell‑off, potentially pulling the index lower. He cites a softening labor market, sticky inflation, and lingering tariff‑driven price pressures as catalysts that could force the Fed to keep rates high, dampening growth and increasing downside risk. To mitigate exposure, he recommends diversifying into international, small‑cap, and healthcare equities, which offer lower valuations and stronger earnings prospects.",
