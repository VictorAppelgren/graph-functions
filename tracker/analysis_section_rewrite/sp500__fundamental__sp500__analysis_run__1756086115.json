      "feedback": "Solid baseline: you anchor Ford to concrete metrics (dividend yield ~5%, forward P/E ~10.3, Q2 margin ~4.3%, ROIC ~10%, EV losses ~$1.3B) and frame the stock as an income play with cyclical risk, which is well-supported by the cited sources (65UUBU0OR; 65UUBU0OR; SGB2PAZGK; O4ZEED2EB; 22PL3Q360). But to reach world-class, you must elevate from descriptive notes to a rigorous, multi‑year regime framework with first‑principles anchors, explicit catalysts, and falsifiable invalidation conditions.\n\nActionable edits and enhancements:\n- Add a multi-year regime map anchored in SECTION FOCUS: specify regimes (Base, Upside, Downside) with transition conditions and price/return implications. Tie to invariant anchors: if EV profitability remains below break-even and ROIC stays below WACC, price stays anchored to income with limited upside; if EV margins normalize and EV capex efficiency improves, re-rating is plausible; if tariffs/inflation/backstop policy shifts ease, capex spillovers could lift growth. Ground anchors to first principles such as ROIC vs WACC (cite ROIC framework). Reference the macro policy regime (tariffs, reshoring) explicitly as regime drivers (SGB2PAZGK; O4ZEED2EB).\n- Structure a causal chain: Tariffs/industrial policy (policy levers) -> domestic capex in EV/batteries and chips -> US OEM supply-chain localization and cost structure -> Ford’s EV economics and F-Series cash flow -> dividend sustainability and equity valuation. Explicitly map how each link affects a 3–5 year stock price path; add a dashboard of triggers and invalidation signals (e.g., EV unit profitability crosses a fixed breakeven threshold; tariff baseline changes; capex efficiency improves; warranty/recall costs trend). Cite the tariff/reshoring channel from SGB2PAZGK and the EV-costs picture from 65UUBU0OR.\n- Quantify the base case and scenarios: give numeric ranges for the base-case cash flow impact (e.g., EV losses modest vs. improving; assume no drastic macro shock; project dividend coverage and potential growth rate g near 0–1% to reflect cyclicality). Provide a simple valuation frame (DCF or dividend discount) with transparent inputs (dividend yield, payout ratio, terminal growth). Use the cited figures (dividend ~5%, ROIC ~10%, EV losses ~1.3B) to bound the base case, and set explicit upside/downside bands when EV profitability improves or tariff dynamics shift (65UUBU0OR; SGB2PAZGK).\n- Tighten evidence and reconcile conflicts: acknowledge both the bull case (income stability, low forward P/E) and the bear case (EV losses, cyclicality, slower EV payoff) with equal weight; ensure every assertion ties to a cited ID. Avoid generic statements; quantify whenever possible (e.g., “EV segment posted a $1.3B operating loss in Q2,” “ROIC 10.1%,” “dividend yield 5.18%”).\n- Citation discipline and coverage: place IDs right after the corresponding claim; if you reference Ford’s Robinhood/retail flow or relative valuation, cite 65UUBU0OR and 22PL3Q360 consistently; for tariff/China-policy dynamics include SGB2PAZGK; for ROIC/CF framing lean on 65UUBU0OR and the ROIC article (SCRAPE IDs 4/6). Do not introduce non‑source claims or numbers beyond these IDs.\n\nIn short, rewrite to a regime-driven, first‑principles framework with explicit triggers, a three‑way scenario grid, a concrete base-case valuation anchored to the cited metrics, and a transparent reconciliation of conflicting signals, all tied to the exact ID citations.",
