      "feedback": "Strong scaffold and regime-based framing, but the draft lacks (1) a defensible, first-principles causal chain; (2) a transparent, three-regime scenario with explicit triggers, probabilities, and price/valuations implications; (3) quantified, source-backed inputs rather than descriptive summaries; (4) disciplined citation discipline and reconciliation where sources diverge; (5) a crisp, watch-list of decisive signals keyed to the cross-topic drivers. Actionable edits: rebuild the core argument as a visible chain: inflation momentum (core CPI/ MoM 0.30–0.40% path; wage growth momentum) drives the Fed reaction function (Regimes A/B/C), which then gates discount rates and risk premia, and finally re-prices equity/credit valuations; ground each link in first principles (PV of cash flows, WACC shifts with inflation/policy, regime-dependent beta/risk premia). Recast SECTION FOCUS into a single-page crosswalk that names Regime A/B/C with explicit transition triggers (e.g., sustained core CPI momentum, Jackson Hole guidance, semiconductor capex cadence) and state probabilistic weights (e.g., 50/30/20) plus implied impact on key assets (e.g., tech/AI infra multiples, defensives, crypto credit). Replace generic claims about “base-case” with quantified scenarios: e.g., Ford EV-margin example (Q2 EV losses ≈ $1.3B; adj. EBIT ≈ 4.3%; ROIC ≈ 10.1%; revenue CAGR 2.5% 2014–2024) tied to the EV-capex cycle; ACMR 2025 revenue midpoint ≈ $900m; gross margin ≈ 4% (all with precise units); oil path: Regime A Brent ≈ mid-60s, WTI low-60s with +2.5/ +1.9 mbpd supply/policy change; ensure these are pulled from the cited sources (OGK8WLL69; J99EM2TPZ; T1QE6JPIX; 22PL3Q360; JPAIHPA4N; SGB2PAZGK; Y6SQOEK69; NL5YYTLF2; R3WNA7L7A) and avoid any non-ID tokens. Strengthen citation discipline by attaching a source after every factual claim, and eliminate stray tokens (like incomplete numbers or stray parentheses); reconcile conflicting signals by presenting a probability-weighted synthesis rather than a single-point view (e.g., oil Regime A vs B; Euro-area Regime mix) and preface with a short sensitivity analysis. Add a decisive-watch list: CPI trajectory within 0.30–0.40% MoM core path; wage-growth momentum; Jackson Hole cues; semiconductor capex cadence; RWA/custodial progress to 2030 targets; crypto inflows; auto/EV profitability signals; and energy-market shocks as invalidation triggers (if core inflation accelerates beyond path, or oil surges/shocks energy-demand). Finally, tighten consistency of terminology (stick with Regime A/B/C throughout; remove mixed references) and deliver a concise conclusion noting fragilities and the steps that would alter the view, with direct section anchors to the cited IDs.",
