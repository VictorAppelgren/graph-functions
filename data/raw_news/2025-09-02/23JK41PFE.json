  "description": "The causes of fecal bacteria in coastal and inland waters vary depending on the region. Here's what to know.",
  "content": "Over the holiday weekend, many people looking to cool off from the summer heat were disappointed as some beaches were closed or authorities advised against swimming because of unsafe levels of bacteria.\n\nThe advisories and closures popped up across the East Coast, from Florida to Maine, along inland streams and rivers, and were present throughout the California coast. The culprit: Fecal contamination detected in the water, presenting a risk of illness.\n\nFor decades, beaches across the country have seen days, weeks and months of closures because of elevated levels of fecal bacteria, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. A recent report from the conservation group Environment America found that last year, 61% of beaches it tested nationwide had one day where bacteria levels were potentially unsafe.\n\nBut what is causing the heightened contamination levels?\n\nExperts told USA TODAY that stormwater runoff and sewage overflows were among the most likely causes, both of which are exacerbated by heavy rains, flooding and warming temperatures. Other contributing factors include animal and agricultural waste and failing septic systems.\n\nResearch shows that bacteria warnings are also most prevalent in the summer, when most people are flocking to the beach and water temperatures are at their highest.\n\n\"These beach closures are not uncommon during warm seasons,\" said Antarpreet Jutla, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Florida, adding that while bacteria is a prevalent issue, most beaches are safe for the majority of the year. \"Ninety-percent of all days are safe for beaches in the U.S., on both the East Coast and West Coast.\"\n\nWhat bacteria is being detected in the water?\n\nExperts say most agencies testing beaches and inland waterways for contaminants are looking for \"fecal bacteria indicators\" such as E. coli and enterococci bacteria, among others.\n\n\"In other words, they are testing for the presence of poop \u2013 that's what we're talking about here,\" said John Rumpler, the clean water director at the nonprofit organization Environment America. He said the tests occur at beaches and fresh water sources like streams, lakes and ponds, especially those popular among the public.\n\nOther sources that lead to beach closures and advisories are harmful algal blooms, according to the National Ocean Service. The USA TODAY Network - New England reported on Aug. 29 that more than 20 beaches in Vermont were under bacteria advisories due to high cyanobacteria levels heading into Labor Day weekend.\n\nIngestion or general contact with these bacteria could cause a variety of illnesses and nasty symptoms, such as gastrointestinal illness, skin rashes, respiratory disease and ear and eye infections, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe causes of fecal bacteria in coastal and inland waters vary depending on the region, but in each case it's worsened by heavy rains and extreme weather events like hurricanes and tornadoes, experts said.\n\n\"Heavy rain will absolutely exacerbate sewage overflows and stormwater runoff,\" Rumpler said.\n\nAcross the country, stormwater runoff can carry oil, grease, bacteria, dirt and waste into nearby waterways. More rural parts of the country can also see overflows from factory farms, leading to large amounts of animal waste and other pollutants ending up in ponds, lakes and rivers.\n\nSanitary sewers, which are used in most of the country, can cause problems if they are undermaintained, cracked or become blocked. The EPA estimates these systems overflow as many as 75,000 times each year.\n\n\"There are billions of gallons of sewage overflows in many communities across the country,\" Rumpler said.\n\nAlong with heavy rain, sprawling development and large building projects are \"further destroying nature's ability to absorb storm water,\" he added.\n\nJutla and Rumpler advised that people check their state's website for current beach closures and swimming advisories, though they noted that there's no standard signage to look out for, and not all beaches are monitored frequently.\n\nPeople should avoid swimming in murky lakes, ponds and streams. Health officials also said it's important to avoid swimming after heavy rainfall or flooding, or if the water is an unusual color.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention said those with health problems or taking medicines that affect their ability to fight germs should check with their healthcare provider before swimming in the ocean or other natural bodies of water.",

      "text": "Swimming Beaches\nUpdated June 2021 based on data available through December 2018.\n- About Swimming Beaches\n- What's Happening?\n- Why Is It Important?\n- Why Is It Happening?\n- What's Being Done About It?\n- Five Things You Can Do To Help\n- References\nAbout Swimming Beaches\nAccess to clean swimming beaches contributes to the high quality of life we enjoy in this region. The cleanliness of Salish Sea swimming beaches is an indicator of water quality, and is determined by testing the water for specific types of bacteria.\nBacteria found in human and animal feces (poop) can cause serious health problems if the levels are above water quality standards in recreational areas. Beach closures when waters are contaminated with bacteria prevent people and pets from becoming ill.\nThis indicator tracks the percentage of monitored swimming beaches in the Salish Sea that consistently meet water quality standards through the swimming season, which is between May and September every year.\n\"It is through teachings, transferred from those that hold knowledge (Elders) to those that learn and carry on the knowledge (youth), that the health and well-being of the community are preserved and upheld through the generations.\"\nWhat's Happening?\nBetween 2004 and 2018 at least 87% of monitored swimming beaches in the Georgia Basin and at least 74% of monitored beaches in Puget Sound consistently met water quality guidelines and standards (see chart below).\nIn 2018, 95% of tested beaches in the Georgia Basin met Canadian water quality guidelines for recreation. The number of beaches tracked over time in the Georgia Basin has fluctuated but annual results show that most beaches consistently met the standards each year (see Table 1 below).\nTwo swimming beaches (out of the 61 beaches monitored) in Puget Sound and 5 out of 102 beaches in Georgia Basin exceeded water quality standards more than once through the 2018 swimming season (see Tables 1 and 2 below).\n| Year | Number of Beaches that Failed Standards | Number of Beaches Sampled |\n|---|---|---|\n| 2004 | 1 | 30 |\n| 2005 | 4 | 30 |\n| 2006 | 3 | 34 |\n| 2007 | 2 | 36 |\n| 2008 | 1 | 37 |\n| 2009 | 3 | 46 |\n| 2010 | 1 | 56 |\n| 2011 | 11 | 84 |\n| 2012 | 11 | 98 |\n| 2013 | 15 | 116 |\n| 2014 | 12 | 114 |\n| 2015 | 2 | 30 (Greater Vancouver only) |\n| 2016 | 2 | 30 (Greater Vancouver only) |\n| 2017 | 5 | 104 |\n| 2018 | 5 | 102 |\n| Year | Number of Beaches that Failed Standards | Number of Beaches Sampled |\n|---|---|---|\n| 2004 | 10 | 68 |\n| 2005 | 8 | 67 |\n| 2006 | 15 | 71 |\n| 2007 | 7 | 62 |\n| 2008 | 7 | 53 |\n| 2009 | 15 | 68 |\n| 2010 | 12 | 46 |\n| 2011 | 17 | 76 |\n| 2012 | 6 | 60 |\n| 2013 | 13 | 61 |\n| 2014 | 8 | 60 |\n| 2015 | 16 | 64 |\n| 2016 | 5 | 61 |\n| 2017 | 6 | 62 |\n| 2018 | 2 | 61 |\nWhat are we actually measuring?\nFecal coliform bacteria are present in virtually all warm-blooded animals, including humans. Not all of the bacteria in the fecal coliform group can make people sick but the fecal coliform bacteria group are used as an indicators that contamination from feces is present in water. High levels of fecal coliform in the water means that illness-causing bacteria and viruses associated with animal feces (which are harder to measure) are likely present.\nEscherichia coli (E. coli) represent about 97% of all the coliform bacteria in human feces, which makes them an excellent indicator of fecal contamination.\nAnother form of bacteria, Enterococci, survive longer than fecal coliforms in marine water. This type of bacteria is useful to measure when the source of fecal contamination is further from the swimming area. A strong correlation has been demonstrated between the concentration of Enterococci in marine waters and the risk of gastrointestinal infection.\nWhat are the benchmarks?\nDifferent benchmarks and indicator bacteria are used to interpret water quality data sampled from Georgia Basin and Puget Sound.\nGeorgia Basin\nWater samples taken from swimming beaches in Georgia Basin are tested for levels of E. coli and compared to Canadian Water Quality Guidelines which require that:\n- E. coli levels must not exceed 200 bacterial colonies/100mL for the average (geometric mean) of at least 5 samples, taken less than 30 days apart. In addition, no single sample can exceed 400 bacterial colonies/100 mL. These requirements are used at beaches monitored by Vancouver Coastal Health and Fraser Health.\n- Beaches monitored by the Vancouver Island Health Authority have requirements based on the water type at the beach. At freshwater swimming beaches, E. coli levels must not exceed 200 bacterial colonies/100mL for the geometric mean of at least 5 samples AND a single sample should not exceed 400 colonies/100 mL. At saltwater beaches, Enterococci, is measured. The Enterococci levels must not exceed 35 bacterial colonies/100 mL for the average (geometric mean) of at least 5 samples AND a single sample should not exceed 70 colonies/100 mL.\nPuget Sound\nWater samples taken from saltwater swimming beaches in Puget Sound are tested for levels of the Enterococci bacteria. Samples are compared to Washington's Water Quality Standards which require that:\n- Enterococci levels must not exceed a geometric mean of 30 bacterial colonies/100 mL, calculated from a minimum of 5 weekly samples and a maximum of 12 weekly samples. The statistical threshold value cannot exceed 110 colonies/100 mL, and any one sample cannot exceed 104 colonies/100 mL.\nWhy is it Important?\nClean swimming beaches are an important part of the quality of life in the Salish Sea region. This indicator is closely linked to local practices and management actions.\nSwimming, diving, or wading in water contaminated with fecal bacteria can result in gastrointestinal illness (such as diarrhea or vomiting), respiratory illness, and other health problems. Skin, ear, eye, sinus, and wound infections can also be caused by contact with contaminated water.\nWhy is it Happening?\nFecal contamination at swimming beaches can be caused by many issues, including:\n- Malfunctioning sewage treatment plants and discharges from combined sewers.\n- Improperly maintained septic systems.\n- Sewage from recreational boaters.\n- Rain water runoff carrying pet and other animal waste.\n- A high number of swimmers.\nWhat's Being Done About It?\nCanadian and American agencies routinely monitor Salish Sea recreational beaches during the swimming season and advise local governments or other responsible parties (e.g. BC Parks) to post beach advisories if the most recent sample results do not meet guideline limits. These agencies are also taking actions to help reduce the causes of beach closures due to high levels of bacteria.\nExamples\nBelow are some examples of programs that are helping protect public swimming beaches and reduce causes of beach closures:\n- In Puget Sound, the Beach Environmental Assessment, Communication, and Health (BEACH) Program is led by the Washington State Departments of Ecology and Health along with county and local agencies, tribes, and volunteers. The BEACH Program monitors high-risk saltwater beaches for bacteria and notifies the public when bacteria are at unhealthy levels.\n- The Washington Department of Health helps support Pollution Identification and Correction (PIC) programs in 11 Puget Sound counties. This helps local jurisdictions monitor and notify the public about bacterial pollution at recreational beaches and helps support local corrective actions needed from on-site sewage systems and farms.\n- In Georgia Basin, many recreational boating areas have been designated as \"no discharge zones.\" An eco-rating system has also been developed for marinas, including information about pumpout stations for boaters. Puget Sound has one very large no discharge zone. This zone extends from the southernmost reaches of the Sound up to the border with Canada, and extends west to the New Dungeness Lighthouse in Clallam County, Washington.\n- In Metro Vancouver, and throughout Puget Sound, construction of new combined sewer-stormwater systems is not allowed. These types of systems (also called Combined Sewer Overflows, or CSOs) can cause serious water pollution problems due to overflows during rain storms because they collect both sewage and stormwater runoff in a single pipe system. Existing combined sewers in Metro Vancouver are being monitored and replaced by separate sanitary and storm sewers through infrastructure and sewer capacity upgrading programs. Combined sewers in Puget Sound are monitored and controlled using multiple methods, including separating sewage and stormwater, building new tunnels to store overflow for later treatment, and adding green stormwater infrastructure such as rain gardens.\nLearn More\nThe following links exit the site\n- Washington Dept. of Health - Swimming Beach Advisories\n- Puget Sound Partnership Vital Signs - Swimming Beaches\n- Health Canada - Recreational Water\n- Metro Vancouver\u2019s Environmental Monitoring \u2013 Beaches and Recreational Waters\n- Fraser Health - Beach Conditions\n- Vancouver Coastal Health - Beach Water Quality Reports\n- Vancouver Island Health Authority - Beach Reports\n- Beaches in British Columbia \u2013 Swim Guide\n- Beaches in Washington \u2013 Swim Guide\nSix Things You Can Do To Help\n- Do not attend or allow your children to attend a public bathing beach if they are ill, or recently have been ill, particularly if symptoms included vomiting or diarrhea. To avoid passing an illness to other people, no swimming should occur during an illness and for 48 hours after symptoms have ended.\n- Scoop your pet's poop. Pet waste is full of bacteria that can get washed into waterways and make people sick from swimming in the water. Scoop it, bag it, and place it in the trash.\n- If you're a boater, manage your sewage wastes properly. Do not discharge treated or untreated sewage into our waterways. Use the sewage pump out stations provided at many marinas as a free or low cost service.\n- If your home or business uses a septic system, take time to learn how your system works and keep it properly maintained. Ask for maintenance advice from your local health agency.\n- If you keep livestock, follow manure management practices. Contact your local conservation agency for technical assistance.\n- Keep beaches safe by always using toilet facilities and throwing used diapers in the trash. Toddlers and young children who are not reliably toilet trained should use swim diapers. Diaper changing should occur away from the beach area.\nReferences\nBelow is a listing of references used in this report.\n- United States Environmental Protection Agency. 2012.

      "text": "Beaches across US close during Labor Day weekend due to fecal contamination\nSAN DIEGO \u2212 Thousands of people across the United States are being advised against water-related activities at beaches and other coastal areas during the Labor Day holiday weekend due to unsafe levels of bacteria.\nSwimming caution advisories and closures have been issued for numerous beaches along the East Coast \u2212 from Maine to Florida \u2212 because of water quality concerns caused by elevated levels of fecal contamination. The advisories warn beachgoers to avoid water contact due to potential illness risk from bacteria.\nMeanwhile, authorities on the West Coast also warned of high bacteria levels at beaches, including in San Diego, where part of the Imperial Beach shoreline, Silver Strand shoreline, and Coronado were closed as of Aug. 31, according to San Diego Beach Water Quality.\nAt the start of Labor Day weekend, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health issued an ocean water use warning on Aug. 29 for local beaches due to bacterial levels exceeding health standards. The warnings were issued for parts of Topanga County Beach, Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach and Santa Monica, among others.\nIn Michigan, several beaches were either closed or under bacteria advisories, reported the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network. State officials said some beaches weren't safe for swimming due to potential wildlife contamination.\nConsumption of or contact with water contaminated with feces of humans and other warm-blooded animals can cause a variety of illnesses, such as gastrointestinal illness, skin rashes, respiratory illness and other types of infections, according to the U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency said the most commonly tested fecal bacteria indicators are E. coli and enterococci bacteria, among others. The bacteria can come from sewage discharges, failing septic systems, storm water runoff, and animal and agricultural waste, according to the New York State Department of Health.\nHundreds of beaches had 'potentially unsafe contamination levels' in 2024\nBeaches are a popular destination during the summer months and holidays, such as Independence Day and Labor Day. But closures due to high levels of bacteria and fecal contamination remain a widespread issue across the nation.\nEarlier this summer, high bacteria levels prompted beach closures and advisories from Michigan to New York as beachgoers prepared for Independence Day celebrations. According to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, beach closures from unsafe bacteria levels \"tend to peak in July because it\u2019s hot and more people are there.\"\nA report from conservation group Environment America, released in July, noted that 61% of U.S. beaches had \"potentially unsafe contamination levels\" in 2024. During that year, the group found that 1,930 out of 3,187 tested beaches nationwide experienced at least one day in which indicators of fecal contamination reached potentially unsafe levels.\nThe group also discovered that more than 450 beaches had potentially unsafe levels of fecal contamination for at least 25% of the days tested. The report added that there were over 7,563 health warnings or closures at coastal and Great Lakes beaches in 2024, impacting one out of every 15 swimming days.\n\"Each year, there are an estimated 57 million cases of illness in the U.S. resulting from swimming in oceans, lakes, rivers, and ponds. The vast majority of these illnesses go unreported,\" the report states. \"Contaminated water can also trigger health warnings or closures that interfere with our ability to enjoy the beach.\"\nWhat are beach advisories, closures?\nBeach advisories and closures occur when water quality tests show the presence of one or more contaminants that exceed healthy standards, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Ocean Service. Beachgoers are advised to follow state and local guidelines for advisories and to find information on a beach's current water quality.\nBeach closures and advisories can be caused by excessive rainwater that carries pollution from storm drains to recreational waters, the National Ocean Service says. Pollutions include motor oil, animal waste, pesticides, trash and pathogens.\nOther sources that lead to beach closures and advisories are harmful algal blooms \u2212 such as red tides \u2212 sewage, and chemical spills, according to the National Ocean Service. The USA TODAY Network - New England reported on Aug. 29 that more than 20 beaches in Vermont were under bacteria advisories due to high cyanobacteria levels heading into Labor Day weekend.\nAccording to the Vermont Department of Health, cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae that grow in freshwater, can release toxins into the water that create unsafe swimming conditions. Health effects from coming in contact with cyanobacteria include rashes, abdominal pain, vomiting, liver damage, and dizziness.\n\"It is generally wise to avoid swimming after heavy rains or if the water is an unusual color without first checking with local or state health authorities,\" the National Ocean Service advises.\nContributing: Jalen Williams, Detroit Free Press; Catherine Messier, USA TODAY Network - New England"

      "text": "Understanding the Time series plots\nTime series plots show the changes in each indicator as a function of time, over the period 1980-present. Each plot also shows horizontal lines that indicate the median (middle) value of that indicator, as well as the 10th and 90th percentiles, each calculated for the entire period of measurement. Time series plots were only developed for datasets with at least 10 years of data. Two symbols located to the right of each plot describe how recent values of an indicator compare against the overall series. A black circle indicates whether the indicator values over the last five years are on average above the series 90th percentile (plus sign), below the 10th percentile (minus sign), or between those two values (solid circle). Beneath that an arrow reflects the trend of the indicator over the last five years; an increase or decrease greater than one standard deviation is reflected in upward or downward arrows respectively, while a change of less than one standard deviation is recorded by a left-right arrow.\nHawai'i Beach Closures\nDuring the last five years, there has been a notable decreasing trend and values have remained within the 10th and 90th percentiles of all observed data in the time series.\nBeach closures are the number of days when beach water quality is determined to be unsafe.\nData Interpretation:\nTime series: This time series shows the average number of beach closure days in the Hawai\u2018i\u2013Pacific Islands region from 2000 to 2023. During the last five years, there has been a notable decreasing trend and values have remained within the 10th and 90th percentiles of all observed data in the time series.\nIndicator and source information:\nUnsafe water quality may have significant impacts on human health, local economies, and the ecosystem. Beach water quality is determined by the concentration of bacteria in the water (either Enterococcus sp. or Escherichia coli).\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) supports coastal states, counties and tribes in monitoring beach water quality, and notifying the public when beaches must be closed. The information presented is from states, counties, and tribes that submit data to the EPA Beach Program reporting database (BEACON). Data obtained from the EPA BEACON 2.0 website have been provided to EPA by the coastal and Great Lakes states, tribes and territories that receive grants under the BEACH Act. Data were refined to closure, by state or territory, by year.\nData background and limitations:\nData compiled by states or territories are combined in regions defined as US Large Marine Ecosystems (LME). Changes in the number of beach closure days may be driven by changes in the number of beaches monitored under the BEACH Act versus by state and local municipalities and not by changes in water and/or air quality. Not all US beach closures are captured in this database, because not all beaches in a state or territory are monitored through the EPA BEACH Act.

Browse the state index below to see if current water quality information is available for your favorite beach.\nNOAA Pathogen Forecast\nAn assortment of predictive models and weather related tools have been assembled, primarily related to issues surrounding safe harvest of shellfish around the nation. In partnership with the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), state and academic partners, NOAA is working continuously through the Ecological Forecasting Roadmap to verify and improve model accuracy and resolution, and transition them to a state of operations.\nNCCOS Harmful Algal Bloom Forecasting\nOur HAB forecasts alert coastal managers to blooms before they cause serious damage. Short-term (once or twice weekly) forecasts identify which blooms are potentially harmful, where they are, how big they are, and where they're likely headed. Longer-term, seasonal forecasts predict the severity of HABs for the bloom season in a particular region. Early warning provides health officials, environmental managers and water treatment facility operators information to focus their testing to guide beach and shellfish bed closures or water treatment in a more appropriate timeframe. They also allow the seafood and tourism industries to minimize impacts."

      "text": "Sanitary Sewer Overflows (SSOs)\nOverview\nSanitary sewer systems collect and transport domestic, commercial, and industrial wastewater and limited amounts of stormwater and infiltrated ground water to treatment facilities for appropriate treatment. Sanitary sewers are different than combined sewers, which are designed to collect large volumes of stormwater in addition to sewage and industrial wastewater. Occasionally, sanitary sewers will release raw sewage. These types of releases are called sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs). SSOs can contaminate our waters, causing serious water quality problems, and back-up into homes, causing property damage and threatening public health.\nPossible causes of SSOs include:\n- blockages,\n- line breaks,\n- sewer defects that allow stormwater and groundwater to overload the system,\n- power failures,\n- improper sewer design, and\n- vandalism.\nEPA estimates there are at least 23,000 - 75,000 SSOs per year (not including sewage backups into buildings) in the U.S.\nSSOs that reach waters of the U.S. are point source discharges. Like other point source discharges from municipal sanitary sewer systems, SSOs are prohibited unless authorized by a NPDES permit. Moreover, SSOs, including those that do not reach waters of the U.S., may be indicative of improper operation and maintenance of the sewer systems, and may violate NPDES permit conditions."

      "text": "Over 20 Vermont beaches are under bacteria advisories this Labor Day weekend. Here's where\nPlanning to spend Labor Day weekend at a beach in Vermont?\nIf so, you'll want to avoid the beaches closed due to unsafe swimming water. According to the Vermont Department of Health, cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae that grows in freshwater, can release toxins into the water that create unsafe swimming conditions. Health effects from coming in contact with cyanobacteria include rashes, abdominal pain, vomiting, liver damage and dizziness.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, 22 swimming spots in Vermont are under advisories for high cyanobacteria levels. Here's the full list.\nWhat swimming spots in VT are currently under bacteria advisories?\nThe following beaches and other swimming spots in Vermont are under bacteria advisories as of Friday, Aug. 29:\n- Alburgh:\n- Alburgh Springs Road (High Alert)\n- Alburgh Passage (High Alert)\n- Alburgh Tongue, southeastern tip (Low Alert)\n- Dillenbeck Bay Fishing Access (High Alert)\n- Barnard:\n- Silver Lake State Park \u2013 Dock (Low Alert)\n- Silver Lake \u2013 Northeast Shoreline (Low Alert)\n- Burlington:\n- Burlington Marina (Low Alert)\n- Leddy Park (Low Alert)\n- Texaco Beach (Low Alert)\n- Franklin:\n- Lake Carmi \u2013 Black Woods (Low Alert)\n- Lake Carmi Outlet \u2013 Dewing Road (High Alert)\n- Lake Carmi \u2013 North Beach (High Alert)\n- Lake Carmi \u2013 Patton Shore (High Alert)\n- Lake Carmi State Park (Low Alert)\n- Grand Isle: The Gut (Low Alert)\n- Isle la Motte:\n- Holcomb Boat Launch (Low Alert)**\n- Saint Anne's Shrine (Low Alert)**\n- North Hero:\n- Graveyard Point East (Low Alert)\n- Kings Bay Fishing Access (Low Alert)\n- Pelots Bay (Low Alert)\n- Swanton:\n- Lakewood Drive on Lake Champlain (High Alert)\n- Swanton Boat Launch (High Alert)\nWhen will advisories be lifted for Vermont beaches?\nBeaches can only become safe for swimming when their bacteria levels are back within the safe range, so there is no set amount of time for an advisory. Bloom conditions can change rapidly, so it is best to check for discolored water before heading in.\nUpdated conditions can be checked on the Vermont Department of Health's Cyanobacteria Tracker."

  "argos_summary": "Beach closures across the U.S. during the Labor Day weekend were driven by unsafe levels of fecal bacteria, with stormwater runoff, sewage overflows, animal waste and failing septic systems cited as key contributors. The EPA and state health agencies reported that 61% of beaches tested in 2024 had potentially unsafe contamination, leading to advisories from Florida to Maine and on the West Coast. The incidents underscore the growing impact of heavy rains, warming temperatures and inadequate infrastructure on recreational water quality, posing health risks such as gastrointestinal illness and skin rashes.",
