  "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nAdriana Lima and Andrew Lemmers III are saying goodbye to Los Angeles and heading to New York, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Brazilian supermodel and the film producer have listed their Brentwood property for $15.995 million.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the 0.34-acre home was built in 2022, which is when the famous couple purchased it for $12.35 million. So, why are Lima and Lemmers bidding it adieu after just three years? In an email to the Journal, they said they've been spending more time \"on the other side of the country\" and in Europe, prompting the move to New York.\n\u2022 Would you have invested in eBay or Uber early? The same backers are betting on this vacation home platform at just $2.90 per share.\n\u2022 Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years \u2014 This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It\n\n\"Tucked behind custom gates and mature hedging on one of the widest lots in the flats of North Bundy \u2013 with 120 feet of frontage \u2013 this modern Brentwood estate delivers an extraordinary blend of privacy, design, and innovation,\" says the Compass listing held by Paul Salazar.\n\nThe custom gates aren't the only line of defense \u2014 far from it, actually. You won't find this level of security in just any house. There's an AI-powered camera system, laser beams, automated perimeter alerts after hours and a 24/7 armed patrol service all in place.\n\nBesides the impressive security, this property has just about everything a family could need. The main home features five bedrooms and seven bathrooms, along with a room that could be used as an additional bedroom, office or den. There's a detached guest house that has its own bedroom and bathroom, too.\n\nTrending: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets \u2014 Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nThe main kitchen has two islands and Miele appliances, including a refrigerator, two dishwashers, an oven, a microwave and an espresso station. There's a tucked-away chef's kitchen with a Miele refrigerator and freezer, an eight-burner Wolf range and a walk-in pantry. Finish it off with a climate-controlled wine rack, and this home was made to entertain. The downstairs also features various entertainment areas, including a living room, sitting room and dining room. To encourage indoor-outdoor living, the first floor kitchen and living room open up to the in-ground pool and hot tub, outdoor kitchen and fire pit.",
