      "summary": "The recent cyberattacks on Marks & Spencer, Co-op, and Harrods highlight the vulnerabilities in the retail sector, emphasizing that cybersecurity is now a critical business imperative rather than just a technical concern. These incidents, attributed to the Scattered Spider group, exploited human behavior through social engineering, demonstrating that even advanced systems can be compromised by the weakest link: people. Retailers are urged to treat cybersecurity as a strategic advantage, enhance employee training, regularly update systems, segment networks, and rethink IT service management to protect customer trust and business integrity.",
