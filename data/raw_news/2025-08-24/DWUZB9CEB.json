  "description": "Apple has long offered a refurbished store on its website, where it sells recent generation products at a pretty sizable...",
  "content": "Apple has long offered a refurbished store on its website, where it sells recent generation products at a pretty sizable discount. Unlike other refurbished offerings, Apple guarantees a replaced outer shell, battery, and glass \u2013 ensuring no wear and tear. You also get a 1 year Apple warranty and the ability to add AppleCare if you\u2019d like.\n\nThat sounds great, but is it actually worth it? Well, it depends. We\u2019ll be delving into Apple refurbished listings, and comparing it to other offerings on the market.\n\nOne great thing about Apple Refurbished is that a lot of the time, you can buy current-generation products. For example, the M4 MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac mini are all available on the store. Apple is pretty great about putting new Macs on the store pretty quickly.\n\niPads and iPhones, on the other hand, aren\u2019t the same. You can\u2019t buy an M4 iPad Pro or M2 iPad Air on the refurbished store yet, despite those products being a year old. The most recent iPads on the refurbished store are 2022\u2019s iPad 10th generation and M2 iPad Pro. When it comes to iPhones, you can only buy iPhone 15 models.\n\nThat said, a lot of people (including myself) love Apple Refurbished, mainly because you can effectively purchase products in new condition, just with some less fancy packaging. Instead of a traditional Apple box, you get a plain white box with the text \u201cMacBook Pro\u201d instead of a printed image. It\u2019s also covered with a 1 year Apple warranty, so even if something goes wrong, you\u2019re covered.\n\nWhile there are a number of ways to buy refurbished Apple products out there, I think Amazon Renewed Premium is the best comparison.\n\nWhy? Amazon offers a 1 year return window, allowing you to get your money back if any issues crop up. Yes, that\u2019s a full 365 day return window. Amazon promises 90% battery health as well. Amazon\u2019s Renewed Premium program likely is the closest thing to Apple\u2019s refurbished program.\n\nTo be clear, there\u2019s also a the standard \u201cAmazon Renewed\u201d program, which only offers a 90 day return window. However, that won\u2019t be used in this price comparison.\n\nNow, to answer the ultimate question: Is Apple refurbished worth it? We\u2019ll be comparing prices across a number of products. These prices will vary, and are accurate at the time of writing.\n\nIn short, Apple Refurbished can be a good deal depending on what you\u2019re shopping for. iPhones are almost always a bad deal on Apple Refurbished. Amazon has better deals than what Apple offers, and also offers devices that Apple doesn\u2019t yet.\n\nFor example, Amazon has a renewed premium iPhone 16 Pro for $799, something that Apple just can\u2019t compete with. Amazon also offers iPhone 15 Pro for $690, whereas Apple Refurbished iPhone 15 Pro comes in at $759.\n\nAmazon\u2019s 1 year return window with Renewed Premium is also undoubtedly a good offering, in case you end up changing your mind or realizing a product isn\u2019t the right fit for you.\n\nThat said, when it comes to the latest products, its hard to beat Apple Refurbished. Apple offers the latest M4 MacBook Pro for $1359, whereas Amazon can only offer M3 MacBook Pro models under its renewed premium program.\n\nApple Refurbished can also be more expensive than new offerings sometimes. For example, Apple offers refurbished AirPods Pro 2 for $209, something that you can often buy brand new for cheaper. Amazon is currently selling new AirPods Pro 2 for $169, for example.\n\nUltimately, the conclusion here is that if you\u2019re looking for a high-quality purchasing experience with refurbished tech, Apple refurbished can be a great option. It just isn\u2019t the only one, and you should always cross-shop before making a purchase.\n\u2022 AirTag 4-pack (on sale for 20% off!)",

We recommend that you act quickly if you see an item that you like. A product will be reserved for you once you've completed checking out and we've received full authorized payment. Please note that some payment methods take longer than others and that availability of a refurbished product is not guaranteed until we receive your full payment."

      "text": "Apple Certified Refurbished Products\n(1) What are Apple Certified Refurbished Products?\nApple Certified Refurbished Products are pre-owned Apple products that undergo Apple's stringent refurbishment process prior to being offered for sale. While only some units are returned due to technical issues, every unit is evaluated to ensure it meets Apple's quality standards.\nEach Apple Certified Refurbished Product:\n- undergoes full functionality testing and any defective modules identified in testing are replaced.\n- Apple Watch and Apple Pencil devices that require replacement parts are not included in the Apple Certified Refurbished Program.\n- is put through a thorough cleaning process and inspection.\n- is repackaged (including appropriate manuals, cables, new boxes).\n- includes either the Operating System originally shipped with the unit or, in some cases, a more recent version.\n- is placed into a Final QA inspection prior to being added to sellable refurbished stock.\nRefurbishment procedures follow the same basic technical guidelines as Apple's Finished Goods testing procedures.\n(2) What should I expect when I purchase an Apple Certified Refurbished Product?\n- Substantial savings\n- A fully functional unit with complete documentation\n- The assurance that the unit meets Apple's premiere quality standards, and that its defective components have been replaced by genuine Apple components\n(3) Can I purchase the AppleCare plan for my Apple Certified Refurbished Product?\nAll Apple Certified Refurbished Products are covered by a one-year limited warranty. For more coverage, you have the option of purchasing the AppleCare Plan with your Apple Certified Refurbished Product. The AppleCare Plan provides up to three years of world-class support for Mac, and up to two years of world-class support for iPad, iPod, iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple TV and HomePod.\n(4) A refurbished item that I wanted is no longer available. How can I ensure that I get an item when it's in stock?\nRefurbished supply is usually very limited and we often run out of refurbished inventory. We recommend that you act quickly if you see an item that you like. A product will be reserved for you once you've completed checking out and we've received full authorized payment. Please note that some payment methods take longer than others and that availability of a refurbished product is not guaranteed until we receive your full payment."

  "argos_summary": "Apple\u2019s refurbished store offers recent\u2011generation products with a full warranty and guaranteed replacement of key components, making it a reliable option for those seeking near\u2011new devices. However, for many items\u2014especially iPhones\u2014Amazon Renewed Premium often provides lower prices and a longer return window, while Apple\u2019s inventory can be limited and sometimes more expensive than new models. The best choice depends on the specific product: Apple\u2019s refurbished line shines for the latest Macs and offers a high\u2011quality experience, whereas Amazon\u2019s program tends to be more cost\u2011effective for phones and other frequently updated devices. Ultimately, shoppers should compare prices and return policies across both platforms before purchasing.",
