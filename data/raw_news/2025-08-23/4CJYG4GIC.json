  "content": "Insiders were net buyers of Tasmea Limited's (ASX:TEA ) stock during the past year. That is, insiders bought more stock than they sold.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Tasmea\n\nThe MD & Executive Director Stephen Young made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for AU$250k worth of shares at a price of AU$2.84 each. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (AU$4.24), we still think insider buying is a positive. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.\n\nStephen Young bought 103.00k shares over the last 12 months at an average price of AU$2.83. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Tasmea\n\nTasmea is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of under-the-radar companies with insider buying.\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Tasmea insiders own 46% of the company, worth about AU$479m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Tasmea Tell Us?\n\nThe fact that there have been no Tasmea insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. With high insider ownership and encouraging transactions, it seems like Tasmea insiders think the business has merit. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Tasmea that deserve your attention before buying any shares.",

It powers telemedicine, monitors chronic conditions in real-time, and speeds up drug discovery by analyzing vast datasets for insights into complex diseases.

Investors should note the company\u2019s solid gross margin of 29.33% and modest dividend yield, but also be aware of the single warning sign highlighted by Simply Wall St before committing capital.",
