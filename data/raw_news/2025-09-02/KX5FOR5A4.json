      "text": "Michael Bolton diagnosed with brain cancer glioblastoma. What is that?\nMichael Bolton\u2019s battle with glioblastoma has brought renewed attention to one of the most complex, deadly and treatment-resistant cancers.\nThe singer, 72, told People he was diagnosed in December 2023 after having emergency surgery. He also underwent another brain surgery in January 2024.\nIn the interview published April 30, Bolton said he finished radiation and chemotherapy in October and his most recent scan was clear in early April.\nThe five-year survival rate for glioblastoma patients is about 6.9%, and the average length of survival is estimated to be only eight months, according to the National Brain Tumor Society. However, Bolton told People that he has intentionally not received a prognosis.\nHere's what to know about the aggressive brain tumor.\nWhat is glioblastoma?\nGlioblastoma is a form of brain cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the brain or spinal cord, according to the Mayo Clinic.\nThe cancer is aggressive and can grow quickly while invading and destroying healthy tissue, said Dr. Mustafa Khasraw, neuro-oncologist at Duke University School of Medicine.\n\"It has proven to be very difficult to treat and it's likely to grow back even with the best surgical procedures, therapy and everything,\" he said.\nIt\u2019s estimated that more than 10,000 people will die from glioblastoma every year, according to the National Brain Tumor Society. However, Khasraw said that not all patients die within a year.\n\"In our practice, we have quite a sizeable group of long-term survivors,\" he said. \"They are the outliers.\"\nSome prominent figures who have died from glioblastoma include Mia Love, the first Black Republican woman elected to Congress, Beau Biden, son of former U.S. President Joe Biden, and U.S. Senator John McCain.\nSymptoms of glioblastoma\nAlthough a diagnosis can occur at any age, the Mayo Clinic said older adults are more likely to develop glioblastoma.\nSymptoms of glioblastoma include:\n- Headache\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Confusion, decline in brain function or memory loss\n- Personality changes or irritability\n- Vision changes, such as blurred vision, double vision or loss of peripheral vision\n- Speech difficulties\n- Trouble with balance or coordination\n- Muscle weakness in the face, arms or legs\n- Seizures, particularly in someone who has never experienced them before\nBolton told People magazine his treatments have impacted his short-term memory, speech and mobility.\nIs there a cure for glioblastoma?\nGlioblastoma can sometimes be treated with radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy or brain surgery, called a craniotomy, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\nWhile treatments might slow cancer growth and reduce symptoms, there is no cure.\nIt\u2019s one of the few cancers that has seen little progress in two decades despite increased funding from organizations, institutions and pharmaceutical companies, Khasraw said. This is partly due to the cancer's aggressive nature and how difficult it is to include enough participants in robust clinical trials.\n\u201cIt has been notoriously difficult to discover great new therapies and improve outcomes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an area of unmet need.\u201d\nHowever, the field has recently pivoted to focus on smaller, biological studies. Khasraw encourages patients who have received a glioblastoma diagnosis to seek treatment in a clinical trial.\nAdrianna Rodriguez can be reached at adrodriguez@usatoday.com.\n(This story was updated to add new information.)"

Craig Melvin kicks off 'Today' show hosting gig\nHoda Kotb has left the 30 Rock building, and NBC anchor Craig Melvin is her replacement.\nMelvin, a mainstay at the network, will helm the NBC morning show alongside longtime \"Today\" co-anchor Savannah Guthrie in a shift that kicked off Monday.\nMelvin began his new role by telling audiences how grateful and excited he was to sit in the host seat.\n\"You've sat there so many times but this morning is special. Let's go, this is going to be a beautiful ride,\" Guthrie said to Craig.\n\"And there's no one I would rather ride with than you, so let's do this,\" Melvin said.\nIn a tribute video narrated by Guthrie, the network chronicled Melvin's rise to the role.\n\"Craig's best stories remind us that life's best moments often come with a side of laughter,\" Guthrie said over footage of Melvin's years of reporting.\nMelvin has worked at NBC and MSNBC since 2011, joining as an MSNBC Live anchor through 2022, and an NBC News correspondent since 2012. The Emmy-winning journalist is also a \"Dateline\" anchor and has been with \"Today\" since 2018.\nHoda Kotb makes surprise appearance on 'Today' show, shares letter\nKotb chimed in on social media, posting a screenshot on Instagram of her previous alarms for 3:00, 3:15, and 3:30 am turned off. \"No alarm\u2026whaaaaaaaattttt???\" she captioned the post.\nShe also joined the show via video message, wishing Melvin a happy first day and revealing she had left him a letter hidden in the office.\nThe letter turned out to be a heartfelt poem, \"Today\" revealed: \"Craig! / I'm moving forward, so reach back your hand. / Grab the baton, your world will expand. / The adventures are endless \u2026 the people so dear. / Great memories await, year after year. / Day One! You are ready surrounded by love. / Your team is the kind you can only dream of. / Savannah, Al and Carson are here! / With partners like these, your runway is clear.\n\"From out on the plaza, to inside 30 Rock, / Your fans are so eager, they\u2019re watching the clock. / The time has arrived to rise like the sun. / I am cheering for you, and a fabulous run!\" the poem continued, as she signed, \"XOXO Hoda.\"\nMelvin's family also surprised the newly minted host, his wife and parents both offering words of encouragement that brought him to tears.\n\"He's a great dad and he deserves to be here,\" Melvin's son Delando said.\nWho are the hosts of the 'Today' show?\nCraig Melvin and Savannah Guthrie are co-anchors on the morning show.\nJenna Bush Hager, who has hosted the \"Today\" show's fourth-hour broadcast (aka \"Hoda & Jenna\") alongside Kotb since 2019, announced Tuesday that actress Scarlett Johansson will take a turn at the anchor desk, according to Hager's interview with People magazine. Part of a new approach in the wake of Kotb's exit, Johansson is just one in a carousel of celebrities who will guest-host the show.\nWhen was Craig Melvin chosen as Hoda's replacement?\nOn Nov. 14, Craig was announced by NBC at Kotb's replacement. During an on-air message, Melvin thanked his parents, who he said have overcome many obstacles, the \"Today\" crew, his wife and children. He has been married to sports anchor and reporter Lindsay Czarniak since 2011, and they share two children, Sybil and Delano.\n\"I'm just so thankful for her,\" Melvin said of his wife. \"It's a lot of long days and short nights, and she's been there for me from the beginning.\" During the announcement episode Nov. 14, Kotb praised her successor.\n\"Craig, you are made for this job,\" Hotb said. \"You are that kind of good. You have all the things that this job needs. You're the right person for it.\"Longtime \"Today\" show weatherman Al Roker also made an appearance via video to congratulate Melvin on the new role. \"I knew this day would come. I've watched you grow. I've seen you as a journalist, but more importantly, I've seen you as a dad,\" he said. \"You are so worthy of this. I almost don't have the words.\"\nCraig Melvin previously praised Hoda Kotb ahead of exit\nMelvin and Guthrie both praised Kotb ahead of her exit from the beloved morning show Friday.\nIn a video tribute to Kotb, \"Today\" looked back at her tenure on the show, chronicling her interviews, costumed bits and heartfelt surprises for fans.\n\"If I don't do this interview does that mean she won't leave?\" Guthrie joked to cameras, recalling how the two would need a makeup artist to come in for touch-ups after their off-camera chats got emotional.\n\"She's so special, it's almost beyond description,\" Guthrie said. The two shared another tear-streaked moment after the video wrapped.\n\"Hoda doesn't do interviews, she has conversations,\" said Melvin.\nContributing: Anna Kaufman"

      "text": "Halle Berry addresses her risqu\u00e9 Mother's Day video with boyfriend Van Hunt: 'So what?'\nHalle Berry isn't going to let social media critics dissuade her from talking openly about sex.\nDuring Berry's June 4 co-hosting gig on \"Today with Jenna & Friends,\" Jenna Bush Hager, 43, asked the 58-year-old Oscar winner about a Mother's Day Instagram post that received some blowback. In the May 11 Instagram Reel, Berry promoted her Let's Spin intimacy gel with a video of herself and her 55-year-old boyfriend Van Hunt under the sheets in a hotel bed in Cannes.\n\"I'm going to tell you how my Mother's Day is going to end,\" Berry told her followers as she brandished the travel-size product. She went on to tease how she and Hunt would be making use of it, then concluded the video with, \"Happy Mother's Day once again, everybody. I hope all of you are somewhere spinning.\"\nOn \"Today,\" Berry waved off criticism over whether the post was appropriate.\n\"Other women got in their feelings and (say) 'Was it right for her to be in her bed talking about spinning with her man?' Yes!\" she told Bush Hager. \"And they were saying, 'Should she be talking about that on Mother's Day? Shouldn't she be with her kids somewhere?'\"\nShe responded, \"First of all, it's not 'Kid's Day.' It's called Mother's Day. It's Kid's Day every day of the year. That's my day. If I want to be in bed and spin with my man, then that's what I'm going to do.\"\nBerry has two children: 11-year-old Maceo, whom she shares with ex-husband Olivier Martinez, and 17-year-old Nahla Aubry, her daughter with Gabriel Aubry.\nHalle Berry hits back at critics: 'So what?'\nBerry encouraged viewers to have open conversations about sex within their families.\n\"It's the most natural thing we do as women, as men. And for people to be offended by that, saying, 'Instagram is a family channel!' Well yeah, and we should be allowed to talk about this in our families,\" she said. \"We have sex. It's the most natural thing we do. Men do it; women do it.\"\nShe added, \"It's really important that men and women still keep having orgasms into their later years because that's how we stay healthy.\"\nAs for the visual of her and her boyfriend covered by sheets, Berry said, \"You saw nothing. So we're in a bed \u2014 so what?\"\nHalle Berry makes TV debut with boyfriend Van Hunt\nLater in the show, Hunt made his way onto the set as a guest, bouquet in hand. Berry moved to settle on the sofa opposite Bush Hager and clasped hands with her partner.\n\"We've been doing this for five years together, so this is like the longest relationship I've ever had,\" Berry said. \"When you find your person, you find your person. And now I've found my person, finally.\"\nShe went on to explain how she was set up with Hunt in 2020 by his brother, who worked for her menopause care-focused company, Respin. They established a friendship while socially distancing, Berry explained.\n\"Before we ever got together in any physical way, I had fallen madly in love just through talking and telling and sharing every single thing,\" she said."

Once the clip stops playing, Gere raises his middle finger and Guthrie tries to cover it with the papers she's holding in her hand.\n\"Oh sorry, but that's what I did in the piece,\" said Gere.\nGere was only demonstrating what his character did in the clip, which was cut right before he flipped off another character.\n\"It didn't make any sense without that,\" Gere said.\nWhat happened with Cher?\nOn the \"Today\" show Tuesday morning, Cher talked about what happened when her marriage with her late ex-husband, Sonny Bono, ended.\nHe took all the money the musical duo made together, according to Cher.\n\"He left me with a car and clothes,\" the pop icon said\nAfter explaining what happened, Kotb asked Cher about the advice Hollywood legend Lucille Ball gave her, but Cher warned that it couldn't be said on live TV.\n\"We'll bleep it,\" said Kotb.\nCher then explained that Ball was the only one who came to mind who had faced a similar situation and told her that she wanted her advice.\n\"And she said 'F--- him, you're the one with the talent,'\" Cher said as she recounted the story.\nKotb laughed and seemed shocked after the singer dropped the F-bomb.\n\"Well, you said I could!\" said Cher smiling.\nJulia is a trending reporter for USA TODAY.

ALL. HAPPENING,\" read an Instagram caption from the NBCUniversal-owned cable network.\n\"Set against the shores of the Ocean State, 'The Real Housewives' franchise expands into the world of a tight-knit circle of Rhode Islanders who have deep community roots and families that go back generations,\" the official description said.\nThe statement continued: \"With aspirational lives, thriving businesses and tangled family dynamics, these decade-long friendships prove that in a state this small, there\u2019s no escaping your past\u2026 or each other.\"\nThe franchise follows the drama filled, table flipped lives of wealthy women's lowbrow fights in upper crust cities across America.\nThe franchise boasts shows in Atlanta, Potomac, Orange County, Beverly Hills, Salt Lake City and Miami. The New Jersey, New York City and Dubai editions are in flux. Dallas and Washington, D.C. are no longer airing.\nSince 2005, the \"Real Housewives\" franchise has explored deeper themes that go beyond glitz and glam, including financial instability, divorce, domestic violence, DUIs and the aftermath of home invasions. Two cast members from the franchise have been sentenced to federal prison for fraud charges.\nThe \"Real Housewives of Rhode Island\" hails from production company Evolution Media and is slated to be executive produced by Bravo star and \"Real Housewives\" franchise figurehead Andy Cohen as well as Lucilla D'Agostino, Joseph Ferraro and Jen McClure-Metz.\nRhode Island Film & TV Office executive director Steven Feinberg praised the news in a Facebook post confirming the upcoming program, which has garnered rumors in recent months.\n\"One of the most popular reality-shows ever to grace television, 'The Real Housewives' franchise sparked an avalanche of enthusiasm when word spread that this entertaining series just might land in the Ocean State,\" Feinberg said.\nOcean State political leaders praise 'Real Housewives of Rhode Island'\nRhode Island politicians also applauded the upcoming \"Rhode Island\" show in respective statements after the news was made public.\nGov.

      "text": "Savannah Guthrie opened up about her divorce. She shouldn't be ashamed.\nWhen it comes to talking about divorce, it's OK to be candid.\n\"Today\" host Savannah Guthrie, 53, modeled what being vulnerable about divorce sounds like during a recent podcast conversation, opening up on her \"horrible and sad\" split from former husband Mark Orchard. Speaking on Monica Lewinsky's \"Reclaiming\" podcast in an episode released on July 1, Guthrie said the end of the marriage \"broke my heart.\"\n\"It took me years to recover,\" said Guthrie, who was married to Orchard from 2005 to 2009.\nDivorce is common. Research shows that 41% of first marriages end in divorce and 60% of second marriages and 73% of third marriages end the same way.\nWhile the experience is so ubiquitous, Guthrie's sincere comments raise the question of why don't we talk about divorce more honestly?\n\"People often don't talk about it in an honest way,\" said Deborah Carr, professor of sociology at Boston University and director of the Center of Innovation in Social Science. \"It's rare you see someone honestly say they were devastated and they felt like a failure ... the real emotional dimensions of divorce aren't addressed.\"\nA big reason is the shame and stigma people face when opening up about a relationship ending. Typically, their peers want to know who's to \"blame\" for dissolving a union, rather than how the individual is doing, said Eman Tadros, a marriage and family therapist and professor at Syracuse University. We want the story. But it's not as simple as one partner being right or wrong, she said, so we need to work on ways to reframe divorce as a complex transition with many sides.\n\"People were probably stunned she did not want to talk about this sooner,\" Tadros said. \"It's OK for people to have different lengths of time to process things.\"\n'Uncoupling' versus 'breaking up'\nLanguage is power when overcoming stigma about divorce.\nOne thing people can do is lead with \"I\" statements to take accountability for their feelings, Tadros advised. This is easy to imagine, but hard in practice, she said.\n\"Say 'I' in the beginning of a sentence, instead of 'you hurt me,'\" Tadros explained. \"Then you are speaking about your experiences and not attributing or shifting blame to your partner.\"\nAnother step forward is to replace connotative terms like \"break up\" with neutral ones such as \"uncoupling\" to avoid pointing fingers or assuming the divorce is a loss, rather than a progressive moment for each person, she said. And this applies to friends and family of the couple, too. Gwyneth Paltrow and ex Chris Martin raised eyebrows for using this language, but they had a point.\n\"Saying, 'they broke up' (implies) 'Oh, what happened?'\" she said. Peers should ask open-ended questions, Tadros advised. Instead of asking a friend \"Who did what?\" trying leading with \"How are you both navigating this?\" to provide a blame-free zone for them to express. These small changes can revolutionize divorce discourse from trading barbs to supporting individuals, Tadros said. The result? People who leave relationships feel less isolated and more empowered to start their next chapter.\n\"People cannot support us unless they know what we're going through,\" said Carr. But it's important not to offer unsolicited advice to a divorcing friend, she added. Let them ask for what they need on their own time.\n\"There are many reasons people divorce, and some will be more painful than others,\" said Carr, and people may need professional help to work through trauma.\nBut there's hope in the aftermath. Guthrie herself went on to marry Michael Feldman in 2014. But it is completely normal for anyone to take some time as Guthrie did to recover and make sense of what the marriage meant.\n\"Often times there's guilt to deal with, and that feeling of failure,\" Carr said. \"When (marriage) goes away, they have to rethink every aspect of their future ... That loss of innocence can be really emotionally powerful.\""

In March of 2005, she was released from Federal Prison Camp Alderson in West Virginia\nAfter Stewart's comments to The New Yorker, her publicist and friend Susan Magrino tried to clarify to the outlet that the ex-Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover model was \"not bitter at all and there's no feud.\"\nThe New Yorker chronicled the rise and fall of Stewart's relationship with the Food Network star.

      "text": "'This is the beginning': Bradley Cooper's documentary unites celebrity caregivers\nNEW YORK \u2013 Bradley Cooper has a call to action: Everyone needs to start talking about the caregiving crisis and how to solve it.\nThe Academy Award-nominated actor said as much at a screening for his new documentary, \"Caregiving.\"\n\"This is the beginning,\" he said. \"You know, it actually starts now.\"\nCooper attended the event with his daughter, Lea, who wore a white dress and pink flowers in her hair. And some of Hollywood's most well-known family caregivers joined on Thursday, June 12, at the United Nations headquarters to celebrate Cooper's latest project.\nIn attendance were Emmy Award-winning \"Orange Is the New Black\" actress Uzo Aduba; Bruce Willis' wife, Emma Heming Willis, who is launching a book in September, \"The Unexpected Journey,\" about her caregiving experience; and \"20/20\" coanchor Deborah Roberts, who moderated a panel at the event while her husband, the \"Today\" show's Al Roker, snapped photos from the audience. (Roberts has cared for Roker through several surgeries over the years, including after his prostate cancer diagnosis in 2020.)\nFormer President Jimmy Carter's grandson, Josh Carter, was also there with his family.\nA clip from the documentary (premiering June 24 on PBS at 9 p.m. ET), which features caregivers from across the country, screened Thursday for about 200 guests.\n\"This is the beginning,\" Cooper said, adding he hopes the film sparks a national conversation about the care crisis.\n\"Obviously, the ultimate goal is to actually create a system where people can be taken care of in other ways,\" Cooper said.\nFor now, by telling his own story and amplifying the voices of caregivers everywhere, the documentary aims to build community.\n\"Just so we don't feel alone,\" Cooper said.\nIt's working.\n\"For so long it's felt like it's our family against the world,\" said Kristin Denning, 34, a caregiver who was at the event.\nDenning lives in Georgia and helps care for her mother, who has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease.\nDenning said her father is her mother's primary caregiver. \"And to be here with other people and to hear stories very similar to our own, it's so important to me that we're not alone in feeling these things.\"\nBradley Cooper, Uzo Aduba say they didn't realize they were caregivers at the time\nCooper said he only realized he was a caregiver for his father in retrospect. Aduba echoed the sentiment with her story about caring for her mother.\n\"There's a large, wide net of people who are walking through the same experience and having this invisible work be part of their day-to-day experience, with nowhere or few places where they get to feel as though their voice and experience are heard,\" Aduba said.\nIt's a common refrain from family caregivers, that they didn't know they were part of the caregiving community until later. Matthew Cauli, who continues to share his journey of caring for his sick wife and young son on social media, said the same thing. He had to quit his job when his wife had two strokes and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"I still haven't wrapped my head around it,\" he said.\nFinancial, emotional tolls of caregiving can be all-consuming\nChris Durrance, who directed the \"Caregiving\" documentary, said caregiving is \"perhaps one of the great untold stories of the country today.\"\nFinancial stress and emotional stress are some of the most pressing issues for caregivers, said Ai-jen Poo, executive director and board secretary for Caring Across Generations.\nTarek Rabah, president and CEO of Otsuka North America Pharmaceutical Business, one of the underwriters for the film, understands the emotional toll. His parents are in Lebanon, he said, and it's hard being so far away from them even though he feels \"super blessed\" that they have an in-home caregiver.\nStill, Rabah said he \"dreads the moment\" he gets a call that something has gone wrong.\n\"It's always in the back of my mind,\" he said.\nFor Cauli, the daily stress can be all-consuming and he's been struggling to make ends meet. Between taking care of his wife and his son, Cauli said, he could never go back to a traditional 9-to-5 job.\nDuring the panel, Roberts asked Cauli how he takes care of himself, too. Cauli shook his head and threw up his hands, shrugging. The rest of the room gave knowing nods and chuckled in empathy.\nCauli found his answer in the woman sitting in the audience who continues to regain her strength and relearn skills five years after her strokes changed their lives forever.\nIt might be a cheesy answer, he said, but it's true.\n\"Seeing my wife progress.\"\nMadeline Mitchell's role covering women and the caregiving economy at USA TODAY is supported by a partnership with Pivotal Ventures and Journalism Funding Partners.

She stepped back from the \"Today\" franchise to focus on her life as a mom to her two young daughters, Haley and Hope.\nOn April 28, a month to the day ahead of its launch, Kotb posted an Instagram video to celebrate one month until the wellness company arrived. \"I'm bursting, and I can't wait to share it with you,\" Kotb told fans, adding that she was \"so excited\" about her buzzy project.\nKotb announced her departure from \"Today\" in late September and later told the morning show's audience that her last day would be Jan. 10.

      "text": "Hoda Kotb bids tearful 'Today' show farewell: Final show recap\nIt's the end of an era for the \"Today\" show.\nHoda Kotb, who has anchored the main program for six years and been an NBC staple for nearly two decades, marked her last show Friday.\nThe show transformed into a Hoda-palooza as \"Today\" hosts Al Roker, Craig Melvin, Carson Daly, Savannah Guthrie and Jenna Bush Hager united to pay tribute to their colleague. They were joined by a cast of characters from Kotb's past and a star-studded lineup of special guests.\nAs Kotb bid an emotional farewell, the host's impact on the program and its fans came into view. Loyal watchers outside held up signs, the crew behind the cameras shared in the emotion and NBC peers expressed admiration at Kotb's on-camera evolution.\nHere's how NBC bid farewell to one of their most famous faces.\nA Kathie Lee Gifford return\nKotb's former co-host Kathie Lee Gifford made a surprise return to the show.\nIn a video tribute, she told Kotb: \"You are so beloved. I hope you\u2019re feeling that from everybody.\"\nGifford said she was tuning in from Tennessee and was sorry she couldn't make it, before pulling a bait-and-switch and appearing through the curtains.\n\"I fell in love with Hoda,\" Gifford said of her tenure on the show, calling her former co-anchor \"sunshine in a bottle.\"\nGifford then offered a prayer for Kotb's next chapter as she joined Hager for a wine toast to the future.\n'Hoda & Jenna's' final chapter\nAt the top of the program, Kotb passed Hager a literal baton to mark the transition, saying \"You're the perfect person to do this.\"\nLater, in front of a live studio audience, Hager got the opportunity to share her own heartfelt farewell to Kotb.\n\"Endings can be hard and they can be so beautiful because it\u2019s the start of something new,\" she said, as both women unsuccessfully attempted to hold back tears.\nNBC royalty showed out for Hoda's exodus. Jimmy Fallon joined the farewell to gift her a framed piece of the carpeting from the elevators at 30 Rockefeller Center, where the \u201cToday\u201d show broadcasts.\n\"Onward and upward,\" Fallon signed the framed carpet. Fallon brought the jokes and applauded Kotb on her \"curiosity\" and on-air evolution.\nThe segment also featured a video message from Kotb's mother, who narrated what it felt like to sit on the sidelines of her daughter's illustrious career.\nThe whole day came with a lavender hue. While Kotb herself wore a white pantsuit, crew and fans celebrating her outside the building sported purple hats and scarves. The baton Kotb passed to Hager featured a purple bow, and the walls of the \"Today\" studio were lit up lavender.\nFellow newswoman Gayle King (also dressed in the purple theme) joined Kotb for another surprise, gifting her a T-shirt making fun of the fact that the two women are oft-confused.\n\"I'm so excited that she is doing this on her own terms,\" King said of Kotb's exit.\nHoda Kotb debuts song with Walker Hayes\n\"Fancy Like\" hit-maker Walker Hayes joined the show to perform an original song he penned alongside Kotb.\nThe tune, \"Wednesdays,\" plays on the idea that while life may be punctuated by exclamations (It's a girl! She said yes!) it's made up mostly of just Wednesdays \u2013 average moments that if you love them will end up totaling a quality existence.\nKotb teared up as Hayes performed the song's chorus: \"Just another Wednesday with you.\"\nThe entire tribute \u2212 an hours-long affair\u2212 ultimately wrapped up with Kotb driving away in her mini-van, daughters in the backseat, to the tune of \"Wednesdays.\"\nThe bumper was decked out newlywed style with streamers, cans and a sign that read: \"Just repotted.\"\nSavannah Guthrie, Craig Melvin bid farewell\nIn an anchor-specific video tribute to Kotb, \"Today\" looked back at her tenure on the show, chronicling interviews, costumed bits and heartfelt surprises for fans.\n\"If I don't do this interview does that mean she won't leave?\" Guthrie joked to cameras, recalling how the two would need a makeup artist to come in for touch-ups after their off-camera chats got emotional.\n\"She's so special, it's almost beyond description,\" Guthrie said. The two shared another tear-streaked moment after the video wrapped.\n\"Hoda doesn't do interviews, she has conversations,\" said Melvin.\nThe first video tribute of the morning features messages from longtime fans as well as Hollywood and sports stars. Dwyane Wade, Jamie Lee Curtis and Kristin Chenoweth all offered parting messages.\nCurtis, who was supposed to be at the show in person but was home instead to deal with the fallout from the fires ravaging Los Angeles, gifted Kotb a statue for her home, and Oprah Winfrey offered some parting words as well.\nHoda Kotb's 'Eras' tour featuring Simone Biles, Maria Shriver\nHoda, a Taylor Swift superfan, received an Eras Tour-style sendoff as co-hosts offered her friendship bracelets and aired a 2009 interview with the then-emerging star.\nIn a look back through Kotb's own \"eras,\" the broadcast featured an interview with gymnastics legend Simone Biles and a surprise appearance by Biles herself which brought Kotb to tears.\n\"I'm so proud of you,\" Kotb told Biles. \"I love you.\"\nMaria Shriver, who Kotb credited as helping her find a new chapter, also stopped by the show.\n\"Very few people will do that,\" Shriver said of leaving her post for the unknown, \"and it's so brave.\"\nKotb's daughters Hope and Haley also joined the \"Today\" couch briefly, for a rendition of \"Rainbow Connection\" sung by Kermit the Frog himself.\nKotb shares farewell message with viewers\nKotb took some of the final moments of the show to turn the camera back towards viewers.\n\"This is not a goodbye letter, this is a love letter,\" she said, reading aloud a message she penned to viewers.\nReflecting on what it felt like to \"rip off the news corset\" she once wore during her hard-reporting \"Dateline\" era, she thanked viewers for supporting her as she evolved and became herself on camera in \"the ride of a lifetime.\"\n\"Along the way, you invited me into your lives, your triumphs,\" Kotb said over videos of fans celebrating big milestones like being cancer-free news or receiving a scholarship.\nWhen is Hoda Kotb leaving the 'Today' show?\nKotb's final day on the show is Friday, Jan. 10.\nWho will replace Hoda Kotb with Savannah Guthrie and Jenna Bush Hager?\nHer exit, marked with plenty of fanfare, represents a new chapter for the show. That her anchor chair will be hard to fill is a given.\nMelvin will take Kotb's spot on the main \"Today\" program alongside Guthrie, while the rest of Kotb's duties will be shared.\nLoyal viewers have become accustomed to the specific brand of chemistry Kotb shares with co-host Bush Hager. In her place for now will be a rotating cast of A-listers from Scarlett Johansson to Keke Palmer. The musical chairs approach to hosting imitates a strategy some late-night hosts have used when they go on prolonged leave.\nWho is Craig Melvin?\nMelvin has been with NBC and MSNBC since 2011, joining as an MSNBC Live anchor through 2022, and an NBC News correspondent since 2012. The Emmy-winning journalist is also a \"Dateline\" anchor and has been with \"Today\" since 2018.\nMelvin will begin his role on Monday, Jan. 13, and will continue co-anchoring \"Today Third Hour.\"\n\"I'm beyond excited and grateful,\" Melvin said. \"I wanted to thank NBC and the folks here who deemed me worthy \u2026 I have enjoyed just a lifetime of blessings, and this is the latest in a long line of blessings.\"\nWhy is Hoda Kotb leaving NBC morning show?\nKotb opened up to USA TODAY in October about her decision to leave, saying her exit didn't feel like a risk or loss.\n\"Weirdly, at that point, it was my only choice to me,\" she said. \"I have everything I want. I'm not risking something. I have the love of my family. I have wonderful colleagues who will be my friends forever. I have it. So I didn't feel like, 'What am I losing?'\"\nShe said an inner voice beckoned: \"The whispers were very quiet, and then as they went on they became much louder, to a point where you almost couldn't not listen,\" Kotb said. \"In different forms, it was saying, 'You're an adventurer.' It was saying, 'You need time with your kids (Haley Joy, 7, and Hope Catherine, 5).' It was saying, 'What's this next chapter?' It was saying, 'Have you done it all?'\"\nKotb has worked with NBC News since 1998, originally as a \"Dateline\" correspondent, and has served as co-anchor of the \"Today\" show with Guthrie since 2018.\nWhere is Hoda going after the 'Today' show?\nHer next venture leans into wellness \u2212 a concept she has long spotlighted on the show. In an appearance on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" earlier this month, the newswoman revealed she plans to launch a wellness company in the spring complete podcasts and retreats.\n\"I've been given way more than I deserve, way more,\" she told Clarkson. \"So now it's like this is the season of giving, of helping, of mentoring, of showing and hopefully it could make someone else's life easier.\"\nContributing: Erin Jensen, Taijuan Moorman"

      "text": "'Today' co-hosts Al Roker, Craig Melvin offer update amid Sheinelle Jones absence\nAmid \"Today\" host Sheinelle Jones' ongoing absence, her co-anchors are sending love and prayers her way.\nDuring an Access Hollywood segment that aired Friday, fellow \"Today\" anchors Al Roker, Craig Melvin and Dylan Dreyer offered an update on their colleague who stepped back over three months ago to deal with \"a family health matter.\"\n\"Just talked to her a couple of days ago,\" Melvin said, \"she's taking some time to be with her family and we talk to her all the time. And we love our girl. It's been nice to see how much everyone else loves her too.\"\nThe beloved co-anchor of the NBC morning show's third hour paused hosting duties in December but did not appear to be stepping back permanently from her role. She first raised eyebrows with an absence during the high-profile exit of former \"Today\" main co-anchor Hoda Kotb in January. The celebrations, dubbed a \"Hoda-bration,\" featured messages from \"Today\" personalities sans Jones.\nShortly after, Jones took to Instagram to confirm her hiatus, writing in a post: \"I sincerely appreciate all of you who have reached out while l've been absent from the show. I want to share with you that I'm taking time to deal with a family health matter.\"\n\"We're just praying for her,\" Roker said in the \"Access Hollywood\" clip.\n\"She misses being here,\" Dreyer added. \"She wishes she was here with us but she's doing what she needs to do and she'll be back.\"\nJones shares three children with her husband, Uche Ojeh: oldest son Kayin, 15, and 12-year-old fraternal twins Clara and Uche Jr.\nWe've got Hollywood covered: Sign up for USA TODAY's Entertainment newsletter.\n\"It's not lost on me how lucky l am to have not only the support of my Today Show family, but to also have all of you,\" Jones continued in her post. \"Your kindness means so much to me. I'll see you soon.\"\nJones, a graduate of the esteemed Northwestern University Medill School of Journalism, joined \"Today\" in 2014 after a near-decade at Fox 29 News Philadelphia, where she co-hosted the morning show \"Good Day Philadelphia\" alongside local broadcasting legend Mike Jerrick. She currently co-hosts the third hour alongside Melvin, Al Roker and meteorologist Dylan Dreyer.\nContributing: Jay Stahl"

      "text": "Uche Ojeh, Sheinelle Jones\u2019 husband of 17 years, has died following a battle with brain cancer. He was 45.\n\u201cWith profound sadness, we share this morning that Uche Ojeh, the husband of our friend and TODAY co-host Sheinelle Jones, has passed away after a courageous battle with an aggressive form of brain cancer called glioblastoma,\u201d Savannah Guthrie said on TODAY May 23.\n\u201cThere are no words for the pain we feel for Sheinelle and their three young children. Uche was an incredible person. We all loved him. And so we want to take a moment to tell you more about the remarkable man who was Sheinelle\u2019s perfect partner in life.\u201d\nSheinelle and Uche\u2019s love story began at Northwestern University in the late 1990s, when Sheinelle, then an 18-year-old freshman, offered to show a visiting high-school senior around the campus near Chicago. They were together for eight years before Uche proposed on that same campus of their alma mater.\nThey married in September 2007 in Philadelphia, Sheinelle\u2019s hometown, and welcomed their oldest son, Kayin, in August 2009. Their twins, son Uche and daughter Clara, came three years later in July 2012.\nFor Uche, family, friends and his deep sense of faith were his guiding forces. He was devoted to his Nigerian heritage, instilling in their children a deep connection to their cultural roots. He was an enthusiastic soccer player and sang in the church choir.\n\u201cOne thing he always talked about \u2014 he talked about those kids,\u201d Craig Melvin said on TODAY. \u201cHe loved those kids more than anything else in this world, and was just so proud. He was that dad that was on the sideline at every soccer game. He was at all the concerts, the recitals. He was that guy, and they had such a beautiful love story.\u201d\nThe essence of Sheinelle and Uche\u2019s partnership was captured in small gestures and loving celebrations of victories, big and small. Two years ago, when Sheinelle ran the New York City Marathon for the first time, Uche was there at the finish line to shower her with pride. Sheinelle showed that same support and spirit when Uche completed a triathlon just a few weeks before.\nThe TODAY family is honoring the life of Uche, a devoted husband, loving father and a man whose bright spirit touched everyone who knew him."
