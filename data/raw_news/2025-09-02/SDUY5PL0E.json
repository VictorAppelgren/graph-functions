  "description": "There is still a chance to win big during Wednesday night\u2019s Powerball drawing, which ranks as the fifth largest since the game launched in 1992.",
  "content": "Nationwide, there were 124 tickets that won the $50,000 prize and 25 that won $150,000 with the Power Play option.\n\nThere is still a chance to win big during Wednesday night\u2019s Powerball drawing. It ranks as the fifth largest since the game launched in 1992 and the ninth largest among U.S. lottery jackpot games, according to the Powerball website. The $1.3 billion jackpot has an estimated cash value of $589 million.\n\nThe drawing will be the 41st drawing since the jackpot was last won in California on May 31, the website states, and the odds of producing a winner seem decent. The longest Powerball jackpot run has been 42 consecutive drawings in April 2024, with one lucky Oregonian winning $1.3 billion.\n\nWinners can choose between an annuitized prize or a lump-sum payment of the cash value, with neither estimate including taxes.\n\nOn Monday night, no Georgia tickets matched all five white balls for a $1 million prize, but 10 such winning tickets were sold nationwide, according to Powerball. They were purchased in California, Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, two in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia.\n\nThe odds of winning a prize are 1 in 25, according to Powerball. The odds of winning the jackpot, however, are 1 in 292.2 million. You can watch the Powerball drawings live every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday nights on Channel 2 Action News before the 11 p.m. news broadcast.",
