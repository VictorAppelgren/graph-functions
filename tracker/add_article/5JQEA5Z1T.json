      "summary": "Lucid Group held a special meeting to amend its Certificate of Incorporation, enabling a potential reverse stock split that may signal a strategic shift. The announcement coincided with a 6.88% drop in the stock, a decline that contrasts with broader market gains and reflects investor unease over governance changes. Despite a forecasted 41% annual revenue growth, Lucid remains unprofitable, with a $3.06 billion loss and a market cap of $6.42 billion, and has underperformed both the U.S. auto industry and the overall market over the past year.",
