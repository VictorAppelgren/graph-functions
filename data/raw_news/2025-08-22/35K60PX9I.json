  "content": "Everton Women are pursuing Leicester City defender Ruby Mace after a bid of \u00a3100k ($134,106) was rejected earlier this month.\n\nMace, 21, is entering the final year of her contract with Leicester and missed a behind-closed-doors friendly against Sunderland on Thursday.\n\nA highly-rated England international, Mace has operated mostly as a No 6 for Leicester but is capable of dropping into the backline and in central defence. Her versatility and tenacity off the ball have made her a long-term target for Everton under manager Brian Sorensen, who has been keen to recruit players with experience in the Women\u2019s Super League (WSL) to balance a squad with several new signings.\n\nA product of Arsenal\u2019s academy, Mace made her senior debut for the north London club in September 2020 during an FA Cup quarter-final against Tottenham Hotspur. She made her WSL debut against Brighton & Hove Albion a month later.\n\nFollowing a loan spell with Birmingham City, Mace made a permanent move to Manchester City. After a successful loan spell with Leicester for the 2023/24 season, Mace signed a two-year deal with the club last summer.\n\nSince debuting for England\u2019s under-15s in October 2017, Mace has featured at every subsequent age level and made her senior debut last November in a 1-0 friendly win against Switzerland.\n\nEverton have made eight signings this summer, including defender Maz Pacheco and England international Katie Robinson from Aston Villa. They also signed Spain defender Martina Fernandez on a permanent deal.",

      "text": "Who should win the women\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or this year?\nToday, the 30 nominees for the prize were announced. On September 22, one will be crowned the best player in world football at a ceremony in Paris.\nFive members of England\u2019s Euro 2025-winning squad make the list, along with six Barcelona players and United States representation from Lindsey Heaps and Emily Fox.\nHere, The Athletic\u2019s expert writers have their say on who deserves the accolade. Let us know your picks in the comments below, too.\nAlessia Russo (Arsenal and England)\nSome think the Ballon d\u2019Or should go to the player with the biggest, shiniest trophies. This year, that\u2019s Alessia Russo: European champion with club and country and joint-top scorer in the Women\u2019s Super League (WSL).\nThe argument could stop there, but that would do her a real disservice. Russo is much more than just a winner, goalscorer, or burst of glitter \u2014 she has developed into a complete package.\nAdvertisement\nHer link-up play and creativity, her intelligent movement and tenacity, matter just as much to her team-mates\u2019 goals as her own \u2014 take her vision and hold-up play to assist Lauren James\u2019 opener against the Netherlands. We mostly term defenders or holding midfielders as workhorses, but the effort she showed as the leader of England\u2019s press at the European Championship was superhuman.\nRusso is more than just the finisher: she is willing to do the hard yards that make trophy runs possible. And, of course, she scores the important goals along the way too.\nCerys Jones\nAitana Bonmati (Barcelona and Spain)\nAitana Bonmati has won a third of the six women\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or awards, and three in a row is now on the cards.\nThe 27-year-old midfielder has been the beating heart of Barcelona and the Spanish national team for years. She provides silk and steel, the control amid the chaos.\nShe was desperately close to winning Liga F, the Champions League, and the European Championship this year. That Barcelona and Spain fell just short in the latter two finals, against Arsenal and England, should not obscure her almost otherworldly brilliance.\nMax Mathews\nPatri Guijarro (Barcelona and Spain)\n\u201cIf (during a match) you focus only on Patri, you can\u2019t help but smile,\u201d Spain\u2019s Vicky Lopez said at a press conference in Lausanne this July. \u201cShe may not put on much of a show, but if you watch her\u2026\u201d\nPatri Guijarro did not win the Champions League with Barca or the Euros with Spain, finishing as a runner-up in both competitions, but how many players can say they were the best in a competition they did not win?\nEven if Bonmati won the official award for best player at the Euros, Guijarro could just as easily have laid claim to it.\nShe was the only Spain player to convert in the final penalty shootout against England. She is a complete player, arguably the most consistent in Europe last season. She plays passes nobody else sees and helps bring out the best in her two Ballon d\u2019Or-winning team-mates \u2014 Bonmati and Alexia Putellas.\nAdvertisement\nHer understated midfield role means she will almost certainly miss out on individual awards. She is unlikely to appear in highlights packages and rarely scores or prevents goals, but she is the key cog in two of the best teams in the world \u2014 in much the same way as her compatriot Rodri is for Manchester City and Spain\u2019s men\u2019s teams.\nLaia Cervello Herrero\nMariona Caldentey (Arsenal and Spain)\nThe thing about Mariona Caldentey is that nothing good happens without her. The 29-year-old joined Arsenal from Barcelona with more than 20 trophies, yet somehow managed to announce herself to the world.\nHer WSL stats \u2014 accomplished while operating abnormally deep in midfield \u2014 are brain-breaking.\nShe was first for shot-creating actions (104), progressive passes (199), passes into the penalty area (65), and expected assists (6.9). She was joint-third for goals plus assists (14), passes into the final third (142), key passes (43), tackles attempted (74), and tackles completed (54).\nThe numbers reflect a consummate footballing beast, a player who interprets (and subsequently devours) the game at a different pitch to those around her. Caldentey has delivered big moments, too \u2014 just think of her header in the Euro 2025 final and a performance for the ages against her former club Barca, as Arsenal won a first Champions League trophy since 2007.\nHonestly, just bring out the Ballon d\u2019Or now.\nMegan Feringa\nLucy Bronze (Chelsea and England)\nThere have been points in Lucy Bronze\u2019s long and successful career when she has been the world\u2019s very best player. Right now, the 29-time major trophy winner is not the undisputed No 1.\nBut at the same time, the flying full-back is showing the next generation what it takes to continue playing at an elite level at 33 years old. It can mean strapping up your own thigh with tape mid-game or even playing, oh, I don\u2019t know, with a fractured tibia.\nA treble winner with Chelsea last season and a European champion once again with England this summer, a Ballon d\u2019Or for Bronze, who came second to Megan Rapinoe in 2019, would be a win for not just her achievements this year, but her career overall.\nA win for perseverance, patience, and at times, her utter dominance.\nCaoimhe O\u2019Neill\nHannah Hampton (Chelsea and England)\nI\u2019ve already made the case for Russo, but if I\u2019m to back another English player, it\u2019s at the opposite end of the pitch.\nPlenty of people come for Hannah Hampton\u2019s story \u2014 the goalkeeper who was told she could never play professional sport as a child, who fought to reclaim her England place after being omitted from multiple squads, who came under extra spotlight when Mary Earps retired from international football before this summer\u2019s European Championship \u2014 but they stay for her goalkeeping talents.\nAdvertisement\nThe 24-year-old doesn\u2019t specialise in either shot-stopping or ball-playing, but excels at both. Russo played a crucial role in that James goal against the Netherlands, but that was only possible because Hampton hit a pinpoint pass more than half the length of the pitch, a ball few outfielders would have had the right to strike so accurately, let alone a goalkeeper.\nHer four penalty saves (yes, four) are the stops that will stick in people\u2019s minds, but England could not have even reached those shootouts against Sweden and Spain without Hampton being near-faultless throughout normal and extra time. It would be extraordinary for a goalkeeper to win the Ballon d\u2019Or, but then so is Hampton.\nCerys Jones\nChloe Kelly (Arsenal and England)\nI\u2019m meant to make a case for Chloe Kelly in 100(ish) words \u2014 a task that feels impossible.\nTo start with, there\u2019s her penalty run-up \u2014 the England and Arsenal winger\u2019s purposeful arresting of attention, how she makes us wait and ultimately beg for the crashing of an inevitable tidal wave.\nThere are her crosses \u2014 deft moments of craftsmanship under blinding pressure.\nAnd there is her sheer ability to shoot, which feels like a useless word to describe what happens when Kelly\u2019s foot meets synthetic leather.\nMore than anything, there is the Euro 2025 and Champions League winner\u2019s timing. Who else can transform a domestic and international season into her image, having only played in (at a stretch) half of it? Who else can be so reliable as to become a cliche in a matter of six months?\nSport has clutch players, and it has Kelly. A European champion of incorrigible, unflappable self-conviction with the talent to back it up.\nMegan Feringa\nEsther Gonzalez (Gotham FC and Spain)\nI met Esther Gonzalez just weeks after she won the World Cup in Australia.\nWe were at renowned Spanish chef Jose Andres\u2019 Mercado Little Spain in Hudson Yards, New York, welcoming the then-30-year-old striker to NWSL\u2019s Gotham FC. At just 5ft 3in (161cm), Esther was soft-spoken and unassuming, almost too quiet for a newly crowned world champion.\nAdvertisement\nBut unlike her headline-grabbing team-mates Putellas and Bonmati, Esther carved out her legacy with quiet consistency to become one of Spain\u2019s most reliable goalscorers.\nKnown for her lethal precision and tireless work ethic, she delivered Gotham a championship soon after her arrival. Nicknamed La Reina, she brings both grit and grace to the pitch at national and club level.\nBeyond her impressive goals and spatial excellence, she is a leader who inspires team-mates. She is the kind of player every team dreams of: consistent, fearless and clutch.\nAsli Pelit\nEwa Pajor (Barcelona and Poland)\nArriving at Barca and standing out in your first year in a team full of stars and with two players who have won the last four Ballon d\u2019Or awards \u2014 Bonmati and Putellas \u2014 is no mean feat. But that is exactly what Ewa Pajor did last season.\nThe Poland international arrived to try to fill the void left by Caldentey \u2014 they do not play the same position, but Caldentey brought versatility to the team and even played as a No 9 in many matches during the 2023-24 season. And she succeeded.\nPajor gave the team something it was missing: a centre-forward who could score goals. And nobody came close in that field. She was Liga F\u2019s Golden Boot winner with 25 goals \u2014 nine more than the two players in joint-second on the list, Putellas and Edna Imade \u2014 and Barcelona\u2019s top scorer, with 43 goals in 46 games across all competitions. It\u2019s hard to argue with that.\nLaia Cervello Herrero\nEmily Fox (Arsenal and USWNT)\nEmily Fox always dreamed of playing in Europe, and in the past 18 months, she\u2019s made that dream come true. After helping the U.S. win Olympic gold in Paris, she joined Arsenal and capped off the season by lifting the UEFA Women\u2019s Champions League trophy in Lisbon in May.\nFox was a No 1 NWSL draft pick in 2021, rising through the ranks at University of North Carolina despite early injuries, eventually leading Tar Heels to an ACC title and earning a USWNT call-up while still a sophomore in college. In the pros, she quickly stood out at Racing Louisville, then moved to North Carolina Courage, helping them win the 2023 Challenge Cup.\nAdvertisement\nWhat sets Fox apart is her mental toughness, tactical intelligence and elite athleticism. She is a complete full-back built for the modern game. Now 27, she is arguably the best right-back in the women\u2019s game, delivering on a promise she saw coming since she was five years old.\nAsli Pelit\nMarta (Orlando Pride and Brazil)\nMarta\u2019s stunning stoppage-time equalizer helped secure yet another Copa Am\u00e9rica Femenina title for Brazil last weekend. At 39, the six-time FIFA Player of the Year remains the country\u2019s all-time leading scorer, male or female, with 124 goals in 214 international appearances. A global icon of resilience and skill, Marta\u2019s career spans over two decades, including eight seasons with the Orlando Pride, where she finally lifted the NWSL championship last season.\nFrom her teenage debut to record-breaking feats at World Cups and Olympics, she has inspired generations of soccer players with her dazzling footwork and unapologetic style. Though nominated for the inaugural Ballon d\u2019Or F\u00e9minin in 2018, the most decorated woman in football\u2019s history still awaits that particular honor, a reminder that her legacy transcends trophies.\nAsli Pelit\n(Top photos: Bonmati and Kelly; Getty Images)"
