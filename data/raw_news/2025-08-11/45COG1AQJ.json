  "description": "Jana Kramer and her 'Whine Down' podcast cohosts discuss views on spanking kids, questioning whether it's discipline or hitting in parenting",
  "content": "Jana Kramer and her friends are ready to debate the topic of spanking.\n\nDuring the Monday, August 11, episode of iHeartRadio\u2019s \u201cWhine Down\u201d podcast, the former One Tree Hill star and her cohosts \u2014 Kristen Brust and Kathryn Woodard \u2014 reacted to The Bachelor alum Madi Prewett and husband Grant Troutt\u2019s plans to spank their daughter Hosanna.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wild to just automatically assume they\u2019re going to have to spank this child,\u201d Brust shared. \u201cWe talked about our views at home but I never assumed I\u2019d have to spank [my kids]. \u2026 I\u2019ve never forward thought about hitting my kid.\u201d\n\nWoodard explained that she has spanked her children in the past, but believes it should never be done out of anger.\n\n\u201cWe learned very quickly with all of ours that it didn\u2019t really work,\u201d she added. \u201cFor me, it was always in a, \u2018I\u2019ve tried this. This didn\u2019t work. \u2026 I\u2019ve tried this. Let\u2019s try this.\u2019 Yes, it was different for every child.\u201d\n\nDuring the July 7 episode of Prewett\u2019s \u201cStay True\u201d podcast, Trout explained his thought process when it comes to spanking.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a child, you don\u2019t just discipline them for being good and obeying you. Like, if [our daughter] Hosanna obeys us, we\u2019re not like, \u2018Come here, girl. Pull \u2018em down,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe will on the record [spank our child] because the Bible so clearly says, \u2018Folly is bound up in a child, but discipline drives it far away.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor Kramer, who identifies as a believer in Christ, she isn\u2019t sure what part of the Bible supports spanking.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think God wants us to take a rod and hit our kids,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the piece I don\u2019t understand. The rod can be your tone.\u201d\n\nWhile the \u201cWhy Ya Wanna\u201d singer \u2014 who shares Jolie, 9, and Jace, 6, with ex-husband Mike Caussin and Roman, 20 months, with husband Allan Russell \u2014 said she\u2019s \u201cnot trying to come down on their parenting in the slightest at all,\u201d she has more questions.\n\n\u201cI think there are other ways to discipline,\u201d Kramer added. \u201cI associate it with my negative past of things and I don\u2019t think you should ever be joyful about hitting.\u201d\n\nDuring the candid conversation amongst friends, Woodard also admitted to Durst that it was hard for her to hear, \u201cWe don\u2019t plan on hitting our kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like hearing that,\u201d she said. \u201cThat gives me a negative, like, I\u2019m not hitting my kids but everyone feels differently about that.\u201d\n\nDurst, however, stood by her belief that spanking \u201cis a hit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no opinion either way truthfully,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut we put a title on it. If it\u2019s corrective hitting, it\u2019s still hitting.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the discussion, Kramer jokingly asked her friends, \u201cYou guys good?\u201d\n\nBoth cohosts agreed that it\u2019s a personal topic that every parent will have their own views on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not shamful of it,\u201d Woodard said when discussing her experience with spanking. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that way, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m joyful about.\u201d",

      "text": "Billy Joel\u2019s ex-wife Elizabeth Weber is opening up about where she stands with the famed singer after their infamous affair and nearly decade-long marriage.\n\u201cIf I wanna talk to him or if I have something to say, I am able to contact him whenever I want to,\u201d Weber exclusively told Us Weekly on Friday, August 8. \u201cBut he has a wife and he has children and right now, he\u2019s struggling with something that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s a big thing.\u201d\nIn May, Joel, 76, canceled the remaining dates of his 2025 tour after revealing he had been diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus, a brain condition in which an abnormal amount of cerebrospinal fluid builds up, causing walking, memory, balance and bladder control problems.\n\u201cSo, [our relationship] is as close as it needs to be for two people who decided to divorce 40 years ago,\u201d Weber continued, adding that \u201cof course\u201d she reaches out to her ex amid his health diagnosis.\nWeber first met Joel when she was married to his best friend and former bandmate, Jon Small. The pair engaged in a subsequent affair, which led to the band breaking up and Joel battling a severe depression that included two suicide attempts. (The affair and its aftermath were discussed in the two-part HBO documentary Billy Joel: And So It Goes, which premiered in July.)\nThe pair later reconnected after Weber\u2019s divorce and married in 1973, going on to spend nearly 10 years together before ending their marriage in 1982. Joel went on to marry Christie Brinkley in 1985, welcoming daughter Alexa Ray Joel before calling it quits in 1994. Joel then married cookbook author Katie Lee in 2004 \u2014 the pair divorced five years later in 2009. In 2015, Joel married Alex Roderick. The pair share two children, Della Rose Joel and Remy Anne Joel.\nWeber, for her part, shares a son, Sean Weber-Small, with her first husband.\nWhile speaking with Us, Weber said that her son and her grandchildren also know and are even somewhat close to Joel.\n\u201cI have my grandchildren that he knows and they know him,\u201d she explained. \u201cMy granddaughter Ella taught Bill what TikTok was and showed him what was happening. And his relationship with Sean is important to both of them.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cSo, we\u2019re not distant but we\u2019re, you know, and he lives in Florida and I live in California. But it\u2019s all good. \u201c\nWeber said that her son Sean and Joel \u201cwere very close,\u201d adding that during their marriage the three \u201clived on top of the mountain.\u201d\n\u201cWe entertained each other,\u201d she explained. \u201cBill and I worked all day long and the whole writing process was never done \u2014 in the years that Bill and I were together \u2014 was never done remotely or in [a] studio. It happened in our living room, and Sean was an integral part.\u201d\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available. Call or text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org."

      "text": "Bachelor alum Madi Prewett and her husband, Grant Troutt, are revealing how they plan to discipline their daughter, Hosanna.\n\u201cThe Lord\u2019s discipline is never disciplined out of emotion,\u201d Troutt, 29, said on the Monday, July 7, episode of Prewett\u2019s \u201cStay True\u201d podcast. \u201cThe Lord\u2019s discipline is always off the heels or disobedience or sin. When you have a child, you don\u2019t just discipline them for being good and obeying you. Like, if Hosanna obeys us, we\u2019re not like, \u2018Come here, girl. Pull \u2018em down.\u2019\u201d\nTroutt then emphatically admitted that he and Prewett, 29, \u201cwill\u201d use corporal punishment to discipline Hosanna when they deem it necessary.\n\u201cThe Bible so clearly says, \u2018Folly is bound up in a child, but discipline drives it far away,\u2019\u201d Troutt said, citing another passage about disciplining kids with a rod. \u201cIt says, \u2018It will not kill them.\u2019\u201d\nPrewett, who gave birth to the couple\u2019s first child in January, added during Monday\u2019s episode that any physical spankings would be done gently.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be in a very loving way of saying, \u2018Hi, sweetheart. Do you know why you\u2019re being disciplined? Mommy does not want to discipline you. Mommy does not enjoy having to spank you, but there are consequences to disobedience,\u2019\u201d Prewett said. \u201cThere are consequences to our sin.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cDiscipline proves that we are God\u2019s children. It\u2019s not God\u2019s rejection toward us. It\u2019s actually proof that we belong to him.\u201d\nPrewett and Troutt also concurred that they \u201cwould never\u201d spank anyone else\u2019s child.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not our children. They don\u2019t belong to us,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, we might have a conversation with their parents after and be, like, \u2018What they did is not OK. You should go discipline your children.\u2019 We\u2019re not responsible for them, and we\u2019re not called to discipline them. When it\u2019s our own child, we are responsible [and] we are called to discipline them so that they may be more like Jesus.\u201d\nPrewett was also on the receiving end of being physically disciplined when she was a child.\n\u201cDiscipline is not pleasant. No one enjoys [it],\u201d she quipped. \u201cWhen my dad spanked me when I was young, I didn\u2019t enjoy it. But now I look back, and I\u2019m, like, \u2018Praise God, my dad loved me enough to discipline me. Praise God that my dad loved me enough to train me into righteousness.\u2019\u201d\nPrewett added, \u201cI look back to those moments, and I\u2019m so thankful. In the same way, we get to do that with the Lord.\u201d"

      "text": "Game of Thrones wrapped up its eight-season run in 2019, and there have been a few contenders to be the next GoT, including the prequel series House of the Dragon.\nHowever, Amazon Prime Video\u2018s upcoming miniseries King & Conqueror is giving off some serious Game of Thrones vibes, and there isn\u2019t a dragon in sight.\nThis story is based on the conflict between Harold Godwinson and William the Conqueror in 1066 for the throne of England.\nWhile only a few previews have been released so far, Watch With Us is sharing three reasons to watch King & Conqueror when it debuts on Prime Video later this year.\nThe \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Connection\nIf you thought William the Conqueror looked familiar in the trailer, you\u2019re not wrong. Game of Thrones\u2018 Nikolaj Coster-Waldau \u2014 who portrayed Jaime Lannister on the series \u2014 is playing William on this show. William is a vastly different character from the one that Coster-Waldau played for eight seasons, but the actor just seems to fit in well within a medieval setting.\nJames Norton is also leading the cast as William\u2019s rival, Harold Godwinson. The rest of the performers include several veteran British actors, including Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy, Emily Beecham, Luther Ford and Eddie Marsan. They may not be household names in America, but that\u2019s a solid cast by any standard.\n\u2018King & Conqueror\u2019 Looks Like It Has High Production Values\nAdmittedly, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of trailers from King & Conqueror yet, so our impressions may change. But even from the early look at the show, it looks like a big budget was spent to bring this show to life in a convincing way.\nEverything from the costumes to the battle scenes suggests that King & Conqueror is going all-out with its production. It may not hit on the same level as last year\u2019s incredible Shogun adaptation, but it seems very promising for now.\nThe Series Will Tackle One of the Most Famous Battles in History\nUnless you\u2019re a student of history, you may not be familiar with the Battle of Hastings. Nearly a thousand years later, that battle is still considered to be one of the bloodiest encounters in English history. William and Harold\u2019s forces met on the battlefield, and the winner went on to rule the country and consolidate their power.\nHistorical details about what happened at the Battle of Hastings are incomplete, and there are also conflicting accounts. So there will probably be some creative liberties taken with it. But we do know how it ends, and it should be entertaining to see this fight play out.\nKing & Conqueror will premiere on Prime Video later this year."

      "text": "New details surrounding the drowning death of Emilie and Brady Kiser\u2019s son Trigg, 3, have emerged following the release of the redacted police report.\nThe documents, obtained by Us Weekly on Friday, August 8, detail the events that led up to Trigg\u2019s death on May 18 after he was pulled unconscious from a pool at the influencer\u2019s home in Arizona.\nAlthough details of the security footage were redacted, the Chandler Police Report noted there were discrepancies between what the footage showed and Brady\u2019s initial recollection of events. The report also noted that the pool was unsecured at the time of the incident and that the toddler was not adequately supervised while outside playing near the uncovered pool and did not know how to swim.\nThe police report noted that Trigg had exited the home without being accompanied by a supervising adult and Brady was \u201caware\u201d that his son was playing outside alone.\nAccording to the report, Brady, 28, told officers at the scene who arrived after he called 911 that Trigg had been out of his sight for around \u201cthree minutes\u201d or \u201cfive minutes\u201d before he saw him in the pool and immediately jumped in to pull him out.\nPer Brady\u2019s statement, he told an officer, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a clock, obviously, I don\u2019t know the exact time, but it was moments, it wasn\u2019t minutes, it was moments, it wasn\u2019t that he\u2019d been out of sight for long.\u201d\nHowever, the police report also noted that the security footage did not appear to line up with Brady\u2019s versions of events. Discrepancies included how long Trigg was outside before Brady checked on him and Brady reporting instances that did not occur on the surveillance camera such as saying he saw Trigg \u201cplaying on the grass.\u201d Due to this, a second interview with Brady was undertaken.\nFollowing the second interview with Brady, the report concluded, \u201cThis tragic incident was the result of [Trigg] being in the backyard unsupervised while playing around the unsecured pool and unable to swim. It is clear from the video that he did not go into the water intentionally, rather he tripped and fell in while playing with an inflatable chair.\u201d\nThe Chandler Police Department conclusion continued: \u201c[Redacted] was in the backyard from 18:29:42 hours until Brady found him in the pool at 18:39:00 hours. He was in the water from 18:32:15 until 18:39:07. It is clear Brady\u2019s attention was divided, and he was not watching at all during the critical times mentioned. During two interviews he did not know what was doing before he fell in and did not see [redacted] struggling to swim.\u201d\nIn other statements to the Chandler Police Department, both Brady and Emilie, 26, noted that Trigg had limited swimming skills.\nBrady told police that Trigg had taken some lessons and \u201cknows how to kick his feet and swing his arms\u2026but he\u2019s not proficient.\u201d He added that his son \u201cknows not to go in the water without us.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Emilie also confirmed Trigg had taken some lessons but \u201cdidn\u2019t fully know how to swim.\u201d She added he knew \u201chow to swim to us and he knew how to climb the wall, but where he fell in there was no wall.\u201d\nThe documents also noted that there was no cover securing the pool at the time of the incident. Brady and Emilie both noted they usually use a \u201cKatchakid\u201d safety net, but this was not in place at the time of the incident. In addition, the documents noted there were four access doors to the backyard and the alarm systems did not sound on any of them, none were self-closing and one appeared to be malfunctioning.\nThe Chandler Police Department also included its reasons for submitting the case to Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office for a review into child abuse with criminal negligence claims.\n\u201cThis conclusion is based on several factors. Brady knew the pool net was not on the pool. He knew [redacted] was in the backyard and didn\u2019t know how to swim. According to video evidence, [redacted] was in the backyard unsupervised for more than nine minutes, and in the water for about seven of those minutes,\u201d the report read. \u201cBrady\u2019s statements do not match what is seen on the video; he did not accurately describe one thing did after he went outside. This leads to the conclusion that Brady was not aware of what was doing and was not watching him. The combination of these factors led to drowning, and a remedy to any of the contributing circumstances could have prevented the outcome.\u201d\nThe Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office released a statement on July 25, announcing Brady will not face child abuse charges due to there being \u201cno likelihood of conviction\u201d following review of the evidence.\n\u201cEvery case submitted to the Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office is evaluated using the same standard: whether there is a \u2018reasonable likelihood of conviction,\u2019\u201d the statement continued. \u201cAfter careful review of the evidence submitted by Chandler PD, it was determined this case does not meet that standard. MCAO\u2019s review of the case involved the attorneys assigned to it, along with highly experienced senior attorneys and the County Attorney herself.\u201d\nBrady\u2019s attorney Flynn Carey responded to the update in the case via a statement shared with multiple outlets at the time.\n\u201cWe are grateful to law enforcement and the county attorney for conducting a thorough investigation and confirming that this was a tragic accident,\u201d the statement read.\u201cBrady remains in the midst of the grieving process and is thankful to be with his family as they heal together. We appreciate the compassion and support shown during this difficult time.\u201d"

      "text": "The official cause of death for Kelly Clarkson\u2019s ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock, has been confirmed.\nSilver Bow County Coroner Dan Hollis told Us Weekly on Monday, August 11, that Blackstock\u2019s cause of death was melanoma, a form of skin cancer, and the manner of his death was natural causes. \u201cBrandon Blackstock passed away peacefully at his home in Butte, Montana on August 7th under hospice care surrounded by his family,\u201d Hollis said in a statement.\nBlackstock died on August 7 after privately battling cancer for three years. He was 48.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,\u201d a family rep told Us in a statement. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\nOne day earlier, Clarkson, 43, alerted fans to Blackstock\u2019s illness when she put her Las Vegas residency on pause, though she didn\u2019t reveal the nature of his condition at the time.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,\u201d she announced via Instagram on August 6. \u201cWhile I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children\u2019s father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them. I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.\u201d\nClarkson and Blackstock wed in October 2013 and went on to welcome daughter River, 11, and son Remington, 9. During their marriage, Blackstock worked as the singer\u2019s manager. Clarkson ultimately filed for divorce in June 2020 after nearly seven years. The pair finalized the proceedings in March 2022 following a messy legal battle.\nPrior to his relationship with Clarkson, Blackstock was married to Melissa Ashworth from 2001 to 2012. The exes shared daughter Savannah, 23, and son Seth, 18.\nIn January 2022, Blackstock became a first-time grandfather when Savannah gave birth to her and now-husband Quentin Lee\u2019s son, Lake. Savannah announced in July that the couple are expecting their second baby.\nOutside of his marriage to Clarkson, Brandon had another Hollywood connection via his father, Narvel Blackstock, who was Clarkson\u2019s manager earlier in her career. Narvel was previously married to Reba McEntire from 1989 to 2015, during which time she was stepmom to Brandon and his two sisters, Chassidy and Shawna. Narvel and McEntire\u2019s son, Shelby, who was born in 1990, was Brandon\u2019s half-brother."

      "text": "One Tree Hill\nAmerican drama series One Tree Hill stars Chad Michael Murray as Lucas Scott and James Lafferty as Nathan Scott, half-brothers who butt heads over sports, dating and their family life. The main cast also features Hilarie Burton as Peyton Sawyer, Bethany Joy Lenz as Bailey Scott, Paul Johansson as Dan Scott and Sophia Bush as Brooke Davis.\nThe series premiered on The WB in 2003. Creator Mark Schwahn eventually advanced the timeline by starting season 5 with the characters already out of college, though flashbacks to their college years were also included.\nAfter the end of season 6, it was revealed that Murry and Burton would not be returning for season 7. Murray left primarily due to contract negotiations but made a guest appearance during the final season of One Tree Hill. Burton, meanwhile, has spoken out about alleged mistreatment on set, frequently reflecting on her experience on the \u201cDrama Queens\u201d podcast, which she cohosts with Bush and Lenz.\nThe show run on The WB ended in 2006, but One Tree Hill continued until 2012 on The CW. With nine seasons in total, it is the fourth longest-running series on the network and received numerous award nominations with three Teen Choice Award wins."

      "text": "The Bachelor\nDating reality television series The Bachelor debuted in March 2002 and continues to captivate audiences with its romance and drama more than 20 years later. The show follows one Bachelor who is presented with a pool of women to date and ultimately selects a financ\u00e9e. Each week, the Bachelor goes on romantic dates, often in exotic locales, and presents roses to the women he would like to continue seeing. Those who don\u2019t get roses are eliminated from the show, continually narrowing down the contestants until two women are left. The Bachelor is expected to propose at the end of the season.\nChris Harrison served as the show\u2019s host for 25 seasons until a controversy involving his defense of contestant Rachael Kirkconnell led him to leave the franchise in 2021. Former Bachelor Jesse Palmer took over hosting duties starting in season 26.\nThe Bachelor franchise includes female counterpart The Bachelorette, which features one leading woman and a cast of male suitors. Other spinoffs include Bachelor Pad, Bachelor in Paradise, Bachelor in Paradise: After Paradise, The Bachelor Winter Games, Bachelor Live and The Bachelor Presents: Listen to Your Heart. ABC debuted the highly anticipated senior spinoff The Golden Bachelor in September 2023."

Yeah,\nI'm definitely lying. Okay. I just can't tell if it's\nlike it's very all or nothing, like do I just go, oh,\nbut it's just you know, it's all as well. I\ncan whine about it. Actually, okay, if you have any\npins there fore, it's totally fine and I can just\n(00:53):\nkeep pushing it all down. I seem to be really\ngood at that lately. It seems to be the way\nto go. Yeah, sh it down, no time to cry.\nIt would be the title of my book if I\nwrote one right now. It's actually a great title, don't\nyou like it? Yeah?

I just don't have time to cry much.\nLet's write a book. No time to cry, no time\nto fire up the keyboard again.\nSpeaker 4 (01:23):\nWell, speaking of, it's quite funny because I had just\nsent my editor, I'm sorry, my my public agent, book agent,\nI said, six months later, here's your proposal. She had\nasked at least six months ago. Yeah, I just like\nit's been I haven't had a second to sit down,\nand so it's been in between set. Yeah, where I've\n(01:43):\nbeen because I have all my thoughts. I just had\nto glue them together.\nSpeaker 1 (01:48):\nI feel like something like that.\nSpeaker 2 (01:49):\nYou've got to be like ready to do it though, Yeah,\nand not just like forced.\nSpeaker 1 (01:53):\nI don't know.\nSpeaker 4 (01:54):\nIt's just hard to find the time to have hours\nto like sit I've been doing it on my lunch\nbreaks because I have an hour.\nSpeaker 1 (02:01):\nI don't like lunch. I can't take the hour lunch.\nIt's awful.\nSpeaker 4 (02:05):\nI would just rather not have anything, to be honest.\nAnd what's funny is I always thought that the crew\nliked the hour because it's their chance to but they\nthey also were like, no, I'd rather just have a\ngrazing lunch. Yeah, because you're just tired, you get out\nof it.\nSpeaker 1 (02:17):\nYeah, kind of get done early. Yeah, but with you\nworking lunches were always my jam in the corporate world.\nLove yeah, like give me a box salad gym and\nlet's talk about your power point. Power point girl. So\nany updates from the movie.\nSpeaker 4 (02:33):\nI mean nothing that's like no, just you know, one\nfrom like filming till two in the morning and then\nwaking up for first day of school. But it was\nthat stuff was so fun, like I was just running\non low. Yeah that next day, but it was so\nexciting and getting the kids off to school and stuff.\nSpeaker 2 (02:50):\nSo have you gotten used to your Monday Tuesday weekend?\nSpeaker 4 (02:53):\nI was going to ask I could write until it ends,\nyou know, because well when this airs, will be done\nwith the movie. So this is my final Oh well\nyeah yeah. So it went by fast, which is good.\nBut I think I was talking about it. I put\nit in my stories where I feel like I I\nget overwhelmed and then I settle into things.\nSpeaker 2 (03:12):\nSo because we had just talked about it, yeah, and\nthen you were like, oh, this is actually nice.\nSpeaker 3 (03:17):\nYeah.\nSpeaker 4 (03:17):\nI loved again, I loved, but I did listen back\nand I did I didn't.\nSpeaker 1 (03:22):\nI didn't.\nSpeaker 4 (03:22):\nI was like, well, I kind of did said both.\nI do love sleeping in my bed, and there's just\nso much more responsibility and I not you know, Amy\nis our therapist. You know, she'll be like, can you\npay someone to do this? And I'm like, I don't\nwant to out any more money than I already do,\nso like I know, like I I'm not going to\npay someone to do my laundry, right, even though I\n(03:44):\nknow a lot of people that do and have house\nmanagers and stuff, but I just I can't justify that.\nSpeaker 1 (03:50):\nSo yeah, there's also like an ROI thing for me.\nI really love when something's efficient and monetize as well.\nSo if I'm doing some theme but it cost me\nmore to do it, I'm than I would rather just\nbe with my kids or in my house doing myself. Right, guys,\nSo I have like such a I had the worst\nthing that happened last night and it kept me up\n(04:13):\nall night long because you've already not slept. I know,\nI know, no so y'all saw Bushy tailed for not sleeping,\nthank fumes, But yeah, literally so last night.\nSpeaker 4 (04:27):\nSo Alan's in Munich, right, and you guys know this.\nI don't know if I've shared it on here, But\nlike I used to not be able to sleep alone ever,\nLike I mean, I had the worst anxiety where I\nwould wake up again from my abusive relationship where the\nguy would throw me out of bed at three in\nthe morning. So like truly, I would wake up at\nthree in the morning with like earth shattering anxiety. So\n(04:47):\nwhen I was alone, when I got divorced, that was\nmy biggest hurdle was I literally almost stayed with him\nbecause I was like, I don't think I can sleep\nalone in a house like that was what was in\nthe back of my mind stop me from divorcing him,\nprobably one too many times, like oh no, I don't\nknow if I could sleep like this.\nSpeaker 1 (05:05):\nIt was a terrible debilitating the irony whoop boop boo.\nBut then a mic pun No than sleeping alone, then\nI might drop because I love that more. Anyways, moving on, Yeah,\nit's just so crazy.\nSpeaker 2 (05:20):\nIt's just funny how everybody's so different, right totally well again,\nlike super line came from like trauma I never had\nand until yes, like after and I understand yeah for\nthat situation, and I like it. I understand people now\nin general for sure.\nSpeaker 4 (05:33):\nBut it was weird though, because I it didn't. That\npeace didn't come up until I was in that marriage.\nAnd so the correlation between being from that traumatic, abusive\nrelationship and then being in an unhealthy, very toxic situation, uh,\n(05:53):\nfelt very similar. And so it triggered that three in\nthe morning. And so when we got divorced. I mean\nI remember even when he was in rehab, like I\nwould have people come over. I'm sure I didn't I\nhave like you come over one night. Yeah, I would\nhave you guys, like sleep over. And that was one\nof the reasons where I was like, I need like\nI can't divorce it, like I literally like can't sleep\n(06:15):\nwithout him, or I can't be alone. And so when\nwe finally did and I was forced to do it,\nI then loved it like love, love love love loved it.\nSpeaker 1 (06:25):\nRight.\nSpeaker 4 (06:25):\nSo now when Alan goes out of town and stuff,\nwhen he goes to visit a sun or when he goes,\nyou know, to train his clients, I will wake up,\nbut I don't have my anxiety anymore, which is great,\nLike I'll just go Okay, it's three thirty in the morning,\nbut I'm fine, Like I'm okay, no one's coming to\nhurt me. We're good having said that.\nSpeaker 1 (06:44):\nOh no, last night I look at my alarm app\nI'm watching Teddy Mellencamp's ring thing of did I see that?\nSpeaker 2 (06:52):\nYes?\nSpeaker 1 (06:52):\nOr she got burglarized? Yes, nope, I'm glad I didn't\nsee it. Has kept me up every night, like thinking\nabout that situation. And I thought about it last night\nbecause I'm home alone, right, So I'm like, let me\njust go to my alarm dot com system, right.\nSpeaker 4 (07:11):\nSo I go and I look, and I knew the\nnight before that I got home at two o'clock in\nthe morning. So it shows my foyer motion and it\nshows the garage door being locked and shut, right, So\nlast night at ten thirty at night, I just look right.\nBut then it shows the back door being closed at\n(07:32):\nlike four two in the morning something like crazy, And\nI'm like, how did a back door randomly close while\nwe were sleeping? But like this alarm map is very\nspecific into the to the tee, so I text out\nand I go, hey, I'm kind of spooks right now.\nAnd he's again on the plane to Munich landing in\na few hours, and he's like, what's up? And I'm like,\n(07:55):\ndid you close the door at four something in the morning?\nSpeaker 1 (07:58):\nYesterday.\nSpeaker 4 (07:59):\nHe's like, no, oh lord. When I like start sweating\nin the bed like this is not going to be fun,\nHe's like, Babe, I'm sure everything's fine. Maybe just it\nwas like a weird sensor thing like you'll be okay,\nset the alarm. So I set the alarm and lo\nand behold. I wake up at three in the morning,\nI hear this like like this is like pounding noise,\n(08:20):\nlike not pounding, but like it was almost like a\ndoor slap shut. But I obviously know the alarm's on,\nso the doors it would censor. I think it was\njust the outside sprinkler system. Like I just hear every\nnoise right, and I'm very like alert to it. So\nfrom three to five I am in my like but\nagain it didn't pick up one of my motions when\nI was like going to the close the door. So\n(08:41):\nthen I'm at three point thirty in the morning going\nlike this to my.\nSpeaker 1 (08:48):\nLike if any of my neighbors happening, She's down. No\non my old body. I'm just like like trying to\nlike run, like ging fake runs like like a psycho\nin front of my camera thing to see if it\npicks it up. Long story short, I was up from\nthree to five, just like a ball of And I\ndidn't have anxiety, like it wasn't like right like you\njust because normally I would I would pass out. I\n(09:08):\nwould call an ambulance like I was crazy, like anything\nlike the mediating with anxiety.\nSpeaker 4 (09:14):\nWhere it was like I didn't even have a second\nto like regulate my body was like you're under attack,\nsomeone's coming, you know this. It's like no, I can\ncatch my breath. I'm fine, Like it's all of that.\nIt was just in my head because I started playing\nback things and then I watched kind of a scary\nmovie ish before bed.\nSpeaker 1 (09:28):\nThat was the wrong call. So it showed the door opening,\nso the just closing. So this is the weird thing.\nSpeaker 4 (09:36):\nSo I looked right to see at seven o three\npm or eight something pm the back door was closed.\nOh no, sorry, it was open open, but then it\nclosed randomly for something in the morning. Weird anyway, So\nthat was my I'm a little tired if that's.\nSpeaker 1 (09:53):\nYeah, because I was making it you're not doing like\nyour best clear thinking. That also freaked me out because\nI'm like, how do I protect me and the babies\nif someone comes in right now? That's that's the anxiety\nI live with. Yeah.\nSpeaker 4 (10:06):\nYeah, because I I'm looking at these guys that tried\nto break into her house.\nSpeaker 1 (10:10):\nAm I couldn't have. I'd have been like that it\nit might actually, but not other reasons we think, I know.\nOh anyways, man, that just another time. I'm going to\ntell you the burglar alarm story. We can pin it.\nSpeaker 2 (10:26):\nI have so many burglar alarms going off and no\nexplanation through my years of house sitting that I it\ndrives me crazy.\nSpeaker 1 (10:34):\nYeah. Well, and the system went off a couple weeks ago,\nbut then we're like, is it the fire is it\nthe alarm? So it's like, I don't Honestly.\nSpeaker 2 (10:41):\nThat's one of the reasons I don't have one, because\nit it freaked me out so many times on false\nalarms that I was like, I cannot handle this, Like\nit's it's not worth it to me.\nSpeaker 1 (10:52):\nI just remember years went off, like years ago when\nwe were at your house or was it the fire.\nSpeaker 4 (10:59):\nAlarm that was We thought it was the alarm. Then\nthe fireman, kid, it was.\nSpeaker 5 (11:03):\nA whole thing.\nSpeaker 1 (11:03):\nIt was a whole thing. Oh my goodness, it's funny though. Yeah,\nI was firemen and I was like hanging out with us.\nI just feel like that turned out okay.\nSpeaker 2 (11:12):\nWe had a whole enirement and you're like, are you\nguys paid or is this we liked?\nSpeaker 1 (11:18):\nThere was a fire?\nSpeaker 2 (11:19):\nWe need to The thing is we're asking all the\nquestions as the alarms will not stop going all and\nI was like.\nSpeaker 1 (11:25):\nHi, like, hey, so do you guys?\nSpeaker 5 (11:29):\nI know this?\nSpeaker 1 (11:30):\nYou don't have a wedding ring on. Anyways, that's my update.\nThat's a good one. Thank you. How's everyone?\nSpeaker 2 (11:37):\nWell, her kids aren't in school yet, I guess, But\nhow how is it with kids back in school?\nSpeaker 1 (11:40):\nGreat?\nSpeaker 4 (11:41):\nYeah, yeah, Jason is kind of giving a little bit\nof a I don't want to go to school, but\nyou know the first week.\nSpeaker 1 (11:46):\nYeah, I didn't love it when I was little, Like\nI mean, I had a belly ache like that. I\nremember all the time up until about like fifth grade beyond. Actually,\nI didn't like the first day of school at all.\nI just don't want to get up. I can't, none\nof us.\nSpeaker 4 (12:03):\nI could get my kids to sleep in, that would\nbe amazing, no matter what time they go to bed.\nTheir rise in chine at six thirty.\nSpeaker 1 (12:09):\nA same thing. What is that? I don't know? They\njust love the morning. I know other morning people early\nbedtime though. There we go. Yeah, I'm trying to get\nthat back positive whine about it. What you got, Kristen,\n(12:34):\nbecause you came in. I okay, I'm gonna I will go.\nWe'll go high up, high level because it doesn't we\ndon't need to get into trenches. But I feel like\nI'm very flexible. I'm a very a type person, and\nI am a little OCD that's like diagnosed. So I\nknow that I enjoy a plan and I enjoy a\n(12:58):\nstandard operating procedure. A laminated sheet with rules is kind\nof a you know, do you have your own laminator?\nI wish now that is a bucket list. So I\njust feel like the world that I live in in\nthe industry I live in. And we started our own\nlabel like a year and a half ago, our own\n(13:18):\nrecord label. So that's added another full schedule woven inside\nof all these other schedules. The amount of shifting and\npivoting and flexibility I have had is like wearing down\nmy nervous system. So I brought it to Amy because\n(13:39):\nI'm like, listen, I'm not afraid to be wrong or\nneed to do more work in these areas like I'm\nreally not if you're like you're a control freak, get\nover it and let's figure it out. She would never\nsay it like that, but if that's what I need\nto do, I would do it. But I also have\nall of these systems in these things, in these little\nways I operate because it creates a consus instancy for\n(14:00):\nmy kids that they wouldn't otherwise have because we don't\nhave a data consistently hardly. Ever, we get him for\nthirty six hours, he leaves again, we think we're going\nto get him for five days, like last week, we\nget him for two days instead. So that beach trip\nthat we did was a really fun reframe of us\nlosing three days of vacation with him. So instead we\n(14:21):\ntook the biggies to the beach and made it Biggie's\nbeach vacation. They lived. It was awesome, and we left\nthe baby at home so we could uber and it\nwas great. But I'm just doing a constant reframing, shifting,\npivoting all of the time in every area, and I'm\na little war out and a little irritable. My tolerance\n(14:46):\nis down, and I'm just kind of done being flexible,\nLike I'm tired of accommodating to make sure everyone is\nfeeling great and then feeling depleted. Which I'm an enneagram too.\nI don't know if y'all really believe in that, but\nlike I'm a solid too with a one wing. So\n(15:06):\njustice is great and I love to help out a\ndetriment to myself sometimes, but I've gotten so good. I\nfeel like at better boundaries, and I just feel like\nI try to create a boundary and I'm like, I've\ngot this. It's not that I'm not saying what I need,\nit's just that it doesn't get honored hardly anywhere. So\nhe told me. She told me I needed to leave\n(15:26):\nmy last appointment with her and fight for myself. Was\nthe quote that I needed to block the calendar because\nwe have a ten year wedding anniversary coming up in September,\nand he as a show on our anniversary. It's a Sunday,\nso I thought for sure we would have that together,\nand now he has a show. Fine, but there I\nam right being flexible. So I'm going to meet him\n(15:47):\nin Miami and do the show, and then we're going\nto go from Miami somewhere probably southern Florida, just so\nwe don't spend days traveling and we can just be together.\nBut I put my first ever block on the calendar.\nSpeaker 5 (15:58):\nYay.\nSpeaker 1 (15:59):\nEver ten years, I've never blocked our calendar, not even\nfor babies. It's great, yeah, like their work calendar. Yeah,\nlike it says brust block nice, really proud of yea.\nI will it stay? They better not delete your block. Well,\nI don't know. I just feel like the whine about\nit is sometimes the flexible people are tired too.\nSpeaker 5 (16:21):\nWell.\nSpeaker 4 (16:21):\nI think it's important to tell him that it's important\nto you. Yeah too, like if it was to get\npotential unblocked. It's like, no, we need this and this\nis important not only to me but for us. Yeah,\nAnd he's guarded to speak that.\nSpeaker 1 (16:34):\nBefore I blocked it, but I was like, actually would\nlove that to be official, because it's hard to like\nit's also like scientifically proven. If you plan vacations, it's\nlike really good for you to look forward to something absolutely,\nAnd I don't feel like I'm getting that. Yeah, Like\nI don't get to look forward to anything fully because\nit just changes every five minutes.\nSpeaker 5 (16:52):\nSure.\nSpeaker 1 (16:52):\nLiterally the last time was record breaking. It was I\nplanned the Orlando trip within ten minutes. He came through\non a conference call and he's like, nights out, we\ncan do this now. And I just looked at sweet\nSaint Christine and I go record breaking. She was like unreal,\nLike it's just so yeah. I just I am because\nI can operate well and it doesn't mean I sometimes\n(17:14):\nwant to yeah well.\nSpeaker 2 (17:16):\nAnd I think like scheduled, Like I'm not OCD at all,\nbut I am about a schedule like I can be flexible,\nbut at the same time, like you know, like we're\nvery scheduled, like we.\nSpeaker 4 (17:27):\nLove to have, but even yesterday you can bring that up.\nIs a perfect example what you helped me take something\noff the calendar that I was like, no, like I\nhad to meet that and she was like, yeah, this\nsounds not great on your day off, yeah you know,\nand I was like, you're right. I just didn't want\nto say I didn't want to do it, yeah, because\nI'm tired and I didn't want to let down people\nor whatever.\nSpeaker 1 (17:47):\nAnd she's like, no, we can move it.\nSpeaker 4 (17:48):\nAnd I was like great, thank you, absolutely, And I\nlike having someone advocating to so well.\nSpeaker 1 (17:52):\nI think it's important.\nSpeaker 2 (17:53):\nThere's those moments, right, there's those moments where like this\nis able to be moved, we can be flexible here,\nand then there's things where we can't be flexible here,\nso being able to but again, like I love a schedule,\nI love sticking to a schedule. I love all that,\nso it will get me irritable at times too, but knowing, okay,\nyour anniversary block, for instance, this is somewhere I can't\n(18:16):\nbe flexible X, Y, and Z, I can be flexible,\nyou know, and kind of recognizing those things because some\nthings are going to make you more upset, more irritable\nif they move than other things.\nSpeaker 1 (18:25):\nWell, Jannet even talked about it because I was like,\ndo you remember even with Scotland, Yeah, shaking scotlansh that\nstressed me out, like up until the week before, even\nuntil I was like doing this trip solo. I mean,\nI get why you have to do that.\nSpeaker 2 (18:39):\nSo I'm not coming down, but like I couldn't function\nin that world that.\nSpeaker 1 (18:43):\nWay, even though we have that world that is that\nwas tough. Yeah, yeah, it's just wild and I'm I\ndon't know, I'm just trying to find, like you know,\neven school for us, which a couple of things you'll\nbe proud of for me, proud of me for I\nscheduled my consultation for my potential lift nice and then\n(19:05):\nit got moved speaking of because we scheduled a number\none party on the same day. Oh, totally fine. But\nalso I feel like I might send those kids to\nfive day week school after this next year. Yeah, we\ntalked about that last time. That would be like good consistency. Ye,\nit would feel consistent for us. Yeah, And and they're ready,\n(19:27):\nwhich is huge. But I think like just little things,\nlike I actually applied to that school, which is like\na step, and not because I don't love where we are,\nbut just because I'm like, Okay, we've outgrown this and\nwhat we need is different. Yeah. I love that. Yeah,\nbut it's I'm just tired of being the flexible one.\nYeah for a minute, Yeah, I get that. And maybe\n(19:50):\nif if the larger thing's stuck and I didn't have\nto be flexible, then maybe the little things would be like, oh,\nmaybe that's what I feel like could help because now\nI'm just trying to grab anything. I can tell. It's\na control feeling.\nSpeaker 2 (20:00):\nThings get just really frustrating, Whereas in my opinion, I\ndon't think they would be as frustrating if the bigger\nthings really took weight and.\nSpeaker 1 (20:07):\nYeah we're held Yeah, but maybe try that. Can we\nmove on to a headline this week? Yes do It?\nSpeaker 4 (20:14):\nBachelor's Madison Pruitt and Husband's and Husbands spark backlash after\nsaying it'll be hilarious to spank their baby daughter Hoseanna,\nand I just I have to because I think this matters. Yes,\nis how he said it. So I just want people\nto hear it before we go into it. And we\n(20:34):\nhave the whole context of what this is. So let\nme just play the clip from.\nSpeaker 1 (20:39):\nReally Smart, because I do think context matters that sentence. Yeah,\nhere we go.\nSpeaker 4 (20:45):\nSo I'm gonna play this for you guys right now,\nI have a child.\nSpeaker 3 (20:48):\nYou don't just discipline them for being good and obeying you,\nright like if Hosanna obeysis, We're not like come here, girl,\ncome here, all right, pull them down, get the you know, mama,\nwhich will be hilarious when we start spanking, which we\nwill on the record. Because the Bible it says folly\n(21:09):\nis bound up in a child, but discipline drives it\nfar away.\nSpeaker 1 (21:14):\nSome people could say, well, you can discipline them with timeouts.\nHold on it says with the rod. First of all,\nI have to ask a question. Answer.\nSpeaker 2 (21:23):\nWas he saying it will I don't to me, and\nthis is not depending anything, because I have a lot\nof thoughts on this, But it didn't sound like he\nwas saying it will be hilarious when we spank her.\nI think what he was saying to because he was\nfirst talking about we don't just thank them when they\ndo like good.\nSpeaker 3 (21:43):\nThings, Jesus, We're not like, come here, girl, come here,\nall right, pull him down, get the you know, mama,\nwhich will be hilarious when we start spanking, which.\nSpeaker 1 (21:52):\nWill be hilarious.\nSpeaker 2 (21:53):\nWhen we started, I couldn't tell if he was talking\nabout hilarious with what he was talking about beforehand, or\nif okay, yeah, yes, was a.\nSpeaker 1 (22:00):\nGood I wanted to make sure. I wanted to make\nsure before.\nSpeaker 4 (22:03):\nI wanted to make sure from context of things, yeap,\nSo go for it. I know we've talked about spanking\nand discipline obviously on the show, but his.\nSpeaker 1 (22:15):\nJoyfulness is the most same. I mean, it's weird. Sorry,\nI'm just that's just had more context to it because\nhe seems so.\nSpeaker 4 (22:26):\nHis context is that when we're talking about the Bible\nand the Rod and now I just don't understand the\nfirst part. So basically he's saying that about the obeying\nwith what she.\nSpeaker 2 (22:38):\nWas saying, like, it's not like we're going to spank\nher when she's obeying. That's the part I don't understand.\nAnd I'm curious where this joy and happiness comes from\nwith talking about spanking. That's where I'm very I feel\nlike we're missing something.\nSpeaker 1 (22:48):\nI think it's also wild to listen. I think the\nconversations preemptively before your parents is smart to go like\nhow would you handle this? How would you Also, it's\njust wild to automatic assume they're gonna have to spank\nthis child. It sounds like they've already discussed it though,\nbut like to assume that you would, like I never\nwe talked about our views on it at home, Preston\n(23:11):\nand right, but I never assumed i'd have to spank\nlove Like I never was like, oh, and when I\ndo have to spank her, like, I don't know that.\nIt all feels very like if I if it ever\ngot to that point, what's your view on it or whatever?\nIs a discussion. But yeah, how old is this kid? Baby? Right? Yeah?\nI think yeah, baby is it's a strange thing, like\n(23:31):\nI've never forward thought about hitting my kid. I guess\nthe part that I definitely talked about, yeah, and you've\ntalked about that you have your kids absolutely yeah and\nso and that's where it's like, again, that's something that\nI because you weren't spanked as a kid, right, oh yeah,\noh you were okay for sure? Well so same but\n(23:53):\nit was not great on like my end of it.\nSo for me, I you know that piece of it.\nI think along with my past, that's where it's just\nI think there are other ways to discipline. I don't\nknow if it's that the spanking is out of the\nparents and this isn't like against you at all. I'm\njust curious when parents do spank, is it out of\n(24:13):\nanger or is it out of trying to discipline a case.\nSpeaker 2 (24:16):\nIt should never be out of anger, is the you\nknow behind it. It should just be out of We\nlearned very quickly with all of ours that it didn't\nit didn't really work. So I would say all of\nour kids probably were spanked at one point or like\na little pop. I don't even know if it's a\nspank and it does. It's hard for me, like to\n(24:38):\nhear you say we don't plan hitting our kids. I\ndon't like hearing that. That gives me a negative, like\nI'm not hitting my kids, you know. But everyone feels\ndifferently about that, and I could, you know, whatever, it\nis a hit, sure, but it's just that's where the negative.\nSpeaker 1 (24:52):\nBut you know what I mean, like it it, that's\nwhat is thinking. We put a title on it, that\nmakes it. I have no opinion either way, truthfully, but\nlike we put a title on it's like if it's\ncorrective hitting, it's still hitting.\nSpeaker 2 (25:04):\nSure, I mean, okay, yeah, right, But we did learn\nquickly all of ours had probably trying to think of\nRamsied I don't know, but we learned quickly that it\ndidn't necessarily like with Caden, it didn't.\nSpeaker 1 (25:16):\nIt didn't really work.\nSpeaker 2 (25:17):\nSo we just, you know, I was like, okay, this\nisn't something that worked, and we didn't, you know, do\nit anymore with him. You know, we did other things.\nBut no, I'm not against it, but I don't like\nthat clip.\nSpeaker 1 (25:30):\nYeah, there's something off about the tone of that clip. Yeah.\nWhat rubs me is the which we will like that\njoyful life. It'll be hilarious when we do which, by\nthe way, we will like kind of being like our\nIt's like he was already going after the haters that\nwe're going to hate on them about it like he was.\nIt was almost like it was a proud like and\n(25:50):\nwhich we will like, Oh, I'm sure that's what I\nthink it was.\nSpeaker 4 (25:53):\nYeah, that's what rubs me because and again I associate\nit with something with my negative past of things, and\nI don't think you should ever.\nSpeaker 1 (26:05):\nBe it joyful about hitting. That's where I'm at for sure.\nSpeaker 4 (26:11):\nEven when I say like hitting, it's like hitting spanking, right, yeah, whatever,\nit's just a weird like there's something about the tone\nof that clip that is off, Yeah, very like, which\nwe will like.\nSpeaker 1 (26:22):\nThat's just hilarious. This is a word I would never\nuse either.\nSpeaker 2 (26:25):\nAnd all that to say, like coming from the only\none in the room that has done it before, I\nalways said that we wouldn't, which is what's funny. And\nNick never has. It's only been me that's ever done it,\nwhich is also very interesting interesting. Yeah, But for me,\nit was always in a I've tried this, the shouldn't work,\n(26:48):\ndon't do it out of anger, I've tried this, let's\ntry this, And yes, it was different for every child.\nI think I can't even remember. I know I've spanked\nany probably, but I think that it.\nSpeaker 1 (27:00):\nDid with Kayden.\nSpeaker 2 (27:00):\nI mean, I'll never forget like giving him a little\npop because he kicked me or something and that was\nmaybe a little out of like a reaction more than\nlike an anger or whatever. And he kind of looked\nat me and like hit me back, and I was like, okay, no,\nyou know, like that was a cat in the street.\nAnd again to me, it was he was fighting me.\nI was like changing or changing him or something, and\nhe was fighting me kicked me in the face and\n(27:22):\nI was like no, and I kind of like popped\nhis leg because he kicked me.\nSpeaker 1 (27:26):\nAnd then he just you know, and.\nSpeaker 2 (27:27):\nSo I was like, okay, that that's not how I,\nyou know, wanted to do it. Other instances were like, okay,\nI've tried this.\nSpeaker 4 (27:32):\nIf something comes out of our frustration where it's like\nmy snaps like sto right right, Like that is like\ncould easily have been a pop u a lag instead\nof like but that's me yelling my reason. My voice\nisn't really the answer either, right right, But it's a\nreaction to the frustration of the pop right right.\nSpeaker 1 (27:49):\nYeah, Like I think we all have parents had done\nlike I don't think I well, I don't like I'll\nnever say never about anything, you know, like I just wouldn't.\nAnd as a parent, legend specific and I have learned\nlike he has taught me more about myself and my\nown anger, just because the way we communicate, Like I\nwould never have guessed he just so. I I don't\n(28:13):\nthink there's anything wrong with any of the way that\nanybody's child rearing or doing what they think they need\nto do. It's just such a strange happiness. Yeah about\na brand baby and the potential Yeah, of I think\nyou're doing that. I think it was more a I\nknow I'm going to get haters.\nSpeaker 2 (28:31):\nI'm going to go ahead and just throw the way\nhe did it, yeah, because again, never say never. I'll\ntell him they said that, we're not going to and\nthen I ended up doing it a couple of times,\nyou know, and it's like, okay, so never to say never.\nAnd I'm admitting that I have, you know, which isn't\neasy because I'm going to get people coming after me.\nSpeaker 1 (28:48):\nI did soap in the mouth of that I wanted\nto remind anybody.\nSpeaker 2 (28:51):\nBut yes, that rubbed me wrong. It's not something I'm\nsitting here being. I mean, it's not that I'm I'm\nnot shameful of it. I'm I'm not sitting here like\nI did things I shouldn't do and I hurt my kids,\nLike I don't.\nSpeaker 1 (29:04):\nFeel that way.\nSpeaker 2 (29:05):\nBut also it's not something I'm joyful about and like\nI loved doing that.\nSpeaker 1 (29:12):\nThat was good for me.\nSpeaker 4 (29:13):\nNo one they are, you know, believers as well as\nwe are. They're looking into the Bible. But is a\nfascinating part of it. I'm curious you know your guys'\nstandpoint on that, because I think there's I understand, well,\nI don't understand the book. I still question things in there.\nAnd I think, as my pastor says, that's because I'm like, oh,\n(29:34):\nI don't understand. He goes, well, that's that's where faith\ncomes in. Like you should keep asking questions. And I\nthink in this area that's where I would go. I\ndon't think God wants us to take a rod and\nhit our kids.\nSpeaker 1 (29:43):\nI think we need into that. I need to look\ninto it. I'm like, I don't.\nSpeaker 4 (29:48):\nI don't understand where there's scripture taking the scripture and\ngoing okay, well, because God said this, do this and\nit's like, but also it can be the rod your\ntone and your.\nSpeaker 1 (30:00):\nAnd in that Bible, like I don't know that specific piece.\nSpeaker 2 (30:03):\nI think we're educate too literal sometimes, yes, and I think.\nSpeaker 4 (30:06):\nBut they're the ones that are saying that though too\nwith well, because the scripture.\nSpeaker 1 (30:11):\nThat's the thing.\nSpeaker 2 (30:12):\nYou can't take a scripture and people can feel a\nmillion different ways about what that scripture says, and that\nis clearly what they're taking. I'd have to read it\nbefore I take a stance, But I think in a\nlot of instances we take things a little bit too literal.\nAnd at the same time, yes, I think that discipline\nis very important, and I think that that, to me\n(30:33):\nis more the point.\nSpeaker 1 (30:35):\nProbably of what that scripture is saying.\nSpeaker 4 (30:37):\nYeah, and i'll and i'll you know, on goo on\nMadison's uh, you know side, where she's started to explain\nto her in a way of parenting where it's we\ndon't want to be doing this, like whenever I say, Julie,\nlike I don't want to discipline you right now and\ntake this away, this is just you know, and that's\nyou know, they're they're doing that along the spanking lines.\nBut you know, I think she's there's that piece in it,\n(31:00):\nwhich is which I think is good to tell that\nto their kids. So I'm not trying to come down\non their their parenting in the slightest at all. I\ndon't know them, and but it's just how his reaction\njust kind of rubbed me wrong, and that could be\na piece of my past just coming in.\nSpeaker 2 (31:16):\nAnd no, I think that rubbed Yeah. I mean, I\nthink I'm.\nSpeaker 1 (31:19):\nGoing to do two things on our behalf. I'm going\nto listen to the rest of that podcast, yeah, because\nI'm so curious about how they got there. Yeah, how\ndid we get here that we're laughing? I feel like\nwe're missing something even if we take the tone of it.\nI imagine if somebody just took like our teeny tiny\nclip here, So maybe we miss something before we give\nthem a little benefit of the doubt. And I'm going\nto dig into the ry here all of.\nSpeaker 4 (31:39):\nIt, because I think that they were just talking about\nparenting because I listened. I listened to it the whole podcast.\nI listened to like a good chunk of that twenty minutes,\nand it was them just going into it talking about\nthat we're not parenting. The context is there, which is\nwhy that piece is the most important piece of it.\nSpeaker 1 (31:59):\nWell, I try, and you tried to kick at Yeah,\nwe all tried, guys.\nSpeaker 2 (32:03):\nIt just it came out of nowhere to me with\nthe weird part of the beginning, with like disciplining them\nwhen they're maybe when they're doing good, really objective.\nSpeaker 1 (32:14):\nYeah, for sure, it just was weird. It was very\nodd to me, for sure. Guys. What a time to\nbe alive. You guys good. It was a little oh yeah, no,\nthat's fine. It always it again.\nSpeaker 2 (32:29):\nI'm not like shameful about it, but like when there's\nthings like that, and there's certain things that trigger me\na little bit, like I again, but no, we're totally fine.\nSpeaker 1 (32:39):\nIt doesn't bother me.\nSpeaker 2 (32:40):\nBut that was, like we can I can disagree with\nanybody on stuff like that.\nSpeaker 1 (32:45):\nYeah, I just think like and I'm not. I also\nwas spanked, But I just grew up in such a\nrageful household that like, my parents framed things to be\nthis is my household, my growing up, not you as\na parent. My parents framed things and created narratives to\nmake everything that they were up to Okay.\nSpeaker 2 (33:05):\nI can only remember being spanked like once, so I was, but.\nSpeaker 1 (33:11):\nI did get spanked but I also don't think it was.\nI don't remember a time where I was like I\nwas that was the thing. I did grow up with\na lot of violence, though, it just wasn't against us. Yeah,\nSo I just sometimes I'm this has been an interesting\nthing because recently I've been in a couple of like\n(33:31):\nlittle tiny spats. Yeah, more just like I boil things\ndown to just exactly what it is. Like there's this\nlike clarity that I have where narratives don't affect it.\nLike I'm like, but that's what it is, and that's okay.\nI'd just not me like, but like speaking is hitting.\nIt's not that you're beating your child. I'm not, it's\n(33:54):\nnot that. But like I think sometimes we as a\nsociety like maybe create things around things to make things\nokay that I don't know, like if we call it this,\nthen it's not that. And if we did this, then\nit's not that, you know, but like that is what\nit is, and it's okay, it's not we sugarcoat it.\nYou mean, Yeah, that's yeah for sure, you know. Yeah, right?\n(34:18):\nDoes that make am I making any sense?\nSpeaker 5 (34:19):\nYeah?\nSpeaker 4 (34:32):\nI'm a mom in my early forties and after being\nout of the workplace workforce for fifteen years to raise\nmy kids. I was recently offered a job that feels\nlike a dream come true. It's in a field i've\nalways wanted to break into. The team seem supportive, and\nthe work aligns with with both my interests and the\nkind of impact I want to make. The problem well,\nthe salary is quite a bit lower than I was\nhoping for. Not impossible to manage, but definitely tighter than\n(34:56):\ni'd like, especially as I try to rebuild financial independence\nAt this stage of life, juggling family responsibilities, personal growth,\nand a real desire to feel fulfilled at work, I'm torn.\nDo I take the leap for a job that lights\nme up even if the pay isn't great, or should\nI hold out for something that better reflects my value\neven if it's not as exciting. I think that's a\n(35:20):\ntough one because I think if it's something you really\nwant to do, like I have taken things that are\nI took a movie this year that was well below\nmy quote, but it was something I love being on set.\nI love making movies. I thought it was a really\nfun project, and I think it was one of those\nthings where.\nSpeaker 1 (35:42):\nYou know you're rewarded.\nSpeaker 4 (35:44):\nI think in the end, like this could be something\nthat's great, something comes up that better reflects than awesome.\nI think you could always change. But I also understand\nthere's a piece too where your expertise is value it\nshould valued. So I'm torn with that because I do\nthink you should get what you deserve. But if it's\n(36:06):\nsomething you really want to get into, you've try and\nbeen trying to get into, my gut says, take the leap.\nSpeaker 2 (36:11):\nI mean, I worked in the music business for like\nno money for a very long time. Yeah, so yeah,\nbecause I loved it, So I am all for that.\nI think it's easier said than done to do that\nas a woman than it is as a man. I\nwill that sounds sexist, but I will stand by that\nas long as I'll live, because it is just different,\nyou know, for a man who's going to have a\n(36:32):\nfamily and supporting a family versus a woman who may\nyou may you may not, But I'm all about doing\nwhat makes you happy if it's less money.\nSpeaker 1 (36:42):\nYeah. I also just wonder if it is so set\nin stone this salary, like is there a way to negotiate?\nI think sometimes we sure I can speak for myself\ntake things as face value and I don't negotiate back. Well,\nso I'm like, oh, okay, that's just is what it is.\nLike I'd be afraid to ask for more. That's like\na character flaw for me. I'd be afraid to Yeah,\n(37:03):\nthat's hard.\nSpeaker 4 (37:03):\nSo maybe it's like, hey, I will is there more?\nIf not, Okay, I'll do this for this amount of time,\nbut moving forward if I if I stay at this\nlonger period, I'd like.\nSpeaker 2 (37:13):\nI did that more pay I did that in the music,\nyou know, I was like, hey, I'll you know, I'll\ndo this because you know you're worth Yeah, that's right.\nKnowing that I'm working my way towards something, I think\nsometimes like you just got to know that and in\nthe end is there going to be a reward and\nthe end are you going to be able to work\ntowards something where you're.\nSpeaker 4 (37:29):\nThe connections that you're meeting people. That's why I do\ncertain things that aren't like all right, will this intro\nme to good other good peeps and producers and this\nand the other. You know, so, yeah, there's things that\nwe're going to do potentially later this month where it's\nno money, just going out there and trying to shake\nsome hands and it's like you gotta It's something that\nlights up and you gotta do it. You know. It's\n(37:50):\nI think, I think, go for it and then the\nright thing will always come along no matter what, if.\nSpeaker 1 (37:54):\nYou're if you're open to it, Yeah, I agree, agreed.\nWell what an episode, guys? Is good? A little? I\nlooked at the camera at one point and go, I\nreally feel sad. Do you feel no good? Everything's good.\nWe started a podcast just like it's great. On that note,\nwe hope to all see you. Thanks, thanks for coming."

Come here. All right pull them down.

Mommy does not want to discipline you. Mommy does not enjoy having to spank you.

If you wanna do a whole nursery \u2026 I say [do it].
