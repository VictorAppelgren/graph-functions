  "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s so brutal in a way, so filled with rage and anger,\u201d said Maxim\u2019s top-ranked unsexiest woman at the time.",
  "content": "More like \u201cunsexy and the city.\u201d\n\nOnline viewers are ripping on a controversial 18-year-old Maxim article that listed the most \u201cunattractive\u201d women in showbiz \u2014 with \u201cSex And The City\u201d star Sarah Jessica Parker topping the Mount Rushmore of alleged off-putting celebs. The unflattering ranking came to light via a Reddit post raising eyebrows online.\n\n\u201cIn 2007, Maxim thought it was clever to publish a list of \u2018Unsexiest Women Alive\u2019,\u201d the original poster wrote. \u201cHere are the 5 women they selected.\u201d\n\nSJP was named the \u201cunsexiest woman alive\u201d with the men\u2019s mag describing her as the \u201cleast sexy woman in a group of very unsexy women,\u201d per an article in Today. \u201cHow the hell did this [horse] Barbaro-faced broad manage to be the least sexy woman in a group of very unsexy women and still star on a show with \u2018sex\u2019 in the title?\u201d it read, per news.com.au.\n\nComing in second in this not-hot 100 was Amy Winehouse. The \u201cRehab\u201d singer, who died four years later of alcohol poisoning, was lambasted for her supposed \u201copenly hemorrhaging translucent skin, rat\u2019s nest mane and lashes that look more like surgically attached bats.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d star Sandra Oh placed third on this famous person \u201cface mash,\u201d which the Maxim scribes attributed to her \u201ccold bedside manner and boyish figure.\u201d\n\n\u201cSelf-righteous bellyaching and rapid postnuptial deterioration\u201d landed pop sensation Madonna in fourth place, per the article, which compared her to \u201cNosferatu\u201d actor Willem Defoe.\n\nBritney Spears, who was in the throes of her highly publicized meltdown at the time, rounded out the so-called cosmetically catastrophic quintet due to her weight gain and turbulent personal life.\n\nMaxim derided the pop princess as \u201cfilling chicken-grease-stained sweatpants on the cover of every trashy tabloid and gossip blog on the Internet\u201d and having \u201cgained two kids, two useless ex-husbands, and about 23 pounds of Funyun pudge,\u201d per Pajiba.com.\n\nThe body-shaming hit list came out as a veritable aesthetic Razzie Awards to their Hot 100 list, which was released earlier that year. Coming in first place on the \u201csexiest woman\u2019 rankings was Lindsay Lohan, followed by Jessica Alba, Scarlett Johansson and Christina Aguilera.\n\nThankfully, even the oft-merciless Reddit legions were horrified by the derogatory piece. \u201cExcuse the f\u2013k out of me?\u201d spluttered one Redditor, while another wrote, \u201cNever understood the criticism for SJP\u2019s looks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll these women are hot? Wtf,\u201d exclaimed a third.\n\nSome chalked up the list to the ridiculous beauty standards of the aughts.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk enough about how ridiculously cruel the 2000s were to women\u2019s bodies,\u201d said another. \u201cJessica Simpson could not dare to add half a pound without some low life tabloid turning it to the headline.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, two Jewish women with prominent noses, an Asian woman, a 49-year-old woman, and a woman who had recently aged out of her sexy-baby marketing,\u201d rued one critic. \u201cLet\u2019s call it like it is, none of these women fit into the Eurocentric-blonde-hair-button-nose-big-boob-flat-tummy-\u2018good-genes\u2019-barely-legal category, so sadly I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d\n\nOthers thought the article was especially hypocritical given how most of the writers behind said countdowns generally weren\u2019t easy on the eyes themselves.\n\n\u201cIt should be mandatory for anyone who publishes articles like this to post a picture of themselves beside their work,\u201d declared one appalled reader.\n\nPajiba writer Kayleigh Donaldson pointed out that the article was even reviled at the time, writing that many media outlets deemed it in \u201cshockingly poor taste and stunningly sexist\u201d despite celeb body-shaming being in vogue.\n\n\u201cEveryone engaged in this circle of human bear-baiting, with this handful of women held up as the acceptable targets,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe word \u2018trainwreck\u2019 had never been more utilized in the media vernacular.\u201d\n\nSarah Jessica Parker spoke out about how much the article upset her.\n\n\u201cAm I really the unsexiest woman in the world?\u201d the actress said in an interview with Grazia magazine, the Daily Mail reported. \u201cWow! It\u2019s kind of shocking.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cIt\u2019s so brutal in a way, so filled with rage and anger.\u201d",

      "text": "Britney Spears didn\u2019t shave her head in a fit of rage \u2014 she did it so there would be no way to trace her drug use, a lawyer for her former manager claimed in court.\nJoseph Schleimer opened Sam Lutfi\u2019s libel case against Spears\u2019 parents and conservators by showing dramatic photos of the pop superstar with a shaved head and striking an SUV with an umbrella.\nSchleimer suggested to the LA jury that Spears was afraid a judge would order a test of her hair.\nIf drugs were found, the judge could take away her two sons and give custody to ex-husband Kevin Federline.\nSchleimer claimed Lutfi tried to save the meth-addled Spears from a mental breakdown but lost control \u2014 and was blamed for her being hospitalized and placed under a court-ordered conservator.\n\u201cMy client was made a scapegoat for drug abuse and erratic behavior of Britney Spears,\u201d Schleimer said in his opening remarks Thursday.\nDuring a break when the jury was not present, Superior Court Judge Suzanne Bruguera warned Schleimer that his bold claims had to be supported by evidence.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t waste time on statements just thrown in the air,\u201d the judge said at another point.\nSchleimer said he would prove them through either \u201ctestimony or documentary evidence.\u201d\nHe told the jury that one of the first things he did when he was hired as Spears\u2019 manager was to have drug-sniffing dogs scour her hilltop home \u2014 and they found crystal meth in a trap door.\nSchleimer also claimed Spears took \u201call or most\u201d of 30 prescription amphetamine pills during a 36-hour period in January 2008 and then locked herself in her bathroom. The freakout ended with her being hospitalized.\n\u201cShe liked to use amphetamines, speed or uppers . . . and most of the things that went wrong were related to that drug,\u201d he said.\nSpears almost certainly won\u2019t testify because she remains under a conservatorship overseen by a judge who has ordered her not to appear for trial or a deposition.\nBut Spears\u2019 parents, Jamie and Lynne, both sat in the audience.\nYesterday, a lawyer for Jamie told jurors his client went to heroic lengths to save Britney from drug addiction and mental illness.\nLutfi agreed to work for Spears in July 2007 for 15 percent of her earnings \u2014 but only if she stayed away from drugs, his lawyer said.\nThe court case is the culmination of a long-running battle between Lutfi and Spears\u2019 parents.\nHe is seeking millions of dollars from Spears and her family, claiming her mother\u2019s 2008 book, \u201cThrough the Storm: A Real Story of Fame and Family in a Tabloid World,\u201d lied about him drugging and isolating the pop star.\nHe is also seeking a portion of the singer\u2019s profits, claiming he was a key player in her 2007 album \u201cBlackout.\u201d\nWith AP"

He says things like, \u201cYou said it would only be an hour, but you took an hour and a half,\u201d or, \u201cYou said you\u2019d take a five-minute break and you took a half-hour.\u201d When I respond, he replies, \u201cI\u2019m not complaining about it. I\u2019m just telling you.\u201d When I get upset, he accuses me of \u201cgetting defensive\u201d or says he \u201cdoesn\u2019t like how I\u2019m treating him because he doesn\u2019t treat me that way.\u201d\nWhy do you think he feels it\u2019s OK to make seemingly negative comments about my efforts and then tell me \u201cit is no big deal\u201d or he is \u201cjust making an observation\u201d? How should I respond to his evaluations of me? \u2014 DOING MY BEST IN ILLINOIS\nDEAR DOING: My goodness. It almost seems like your partner never leaves the house without his stopwatch. The next time he does it, your response should be, \u201cThat\u2019s it. Now I\u2019M making an observation. What you\u2019re doing IS a big deal. It is passive-aggressive. We need couples counseling NOW because it could ruin our relationship.\u201d Then schedule an appointment and, if your partner refuses to go with you, go alone, because when you do, you will gain insight.\nDEAR ABBY: I was married for 20 years to a man who slowly isolated me from friends and family until I had no one but him to rely on. Now 49 and divorced, I am without close friends. For the last two years, I\u2019ve been actively trying to build connections. I go to church and volunteer, rent a plot at the community garden to meet other gardeners, attend events at the local library, chat with vendors at the farmers market and know all my neighbors by name. People are friendly, and I\u2019m well liked, but I am still alone every Friday night.\nIt seems like everyone I meet is either too busy or too wrapped up in their own lives to make room for a new friend. If this were just happening to me, I\u2019d chalk it up to my age or stage in life. But my sons, who are 18 and 20, are struggling to find meaningful friendships too. Is this just how the world is now? Where have all the friendships gone? \u2014 FRIENDLESS IN SOUTH CAROLINA\nDEAR FRIENDLESS: Bear in mind that friendships are usually built over time and common interest. Have you tried inviting any of these church or gardening acquaintances over on a weekend night? Have you discussed this with your religious adviser? If you haven\u2019t, that\u2019s what I would recommend.\nAs to your sons and their socialization problem, assuming they are continuing their education, suggest they become active in sports or special interest clubs on campus. If that fails, they should talk to a counselor and ask how they can better integrate themselves into the student body.\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

It's kind of shocking.'\n'It's so brutal in a way, so filled with rage and anger,' she added.\nMaxim has removed the article from its website, and went on to name the Sex And The City star as its 'unexpected crush' in 2008."

      "text": "By Kayleigh Donaldson | Celebrity | May 25, 2021\nThe past year or so has been a fascinating one for the world of celebrities. COVID-19 lockdown led to a massive rewriting of the rules and expectations of fame, and that strange period of quiet forced many of us to re-examine our gossipy pasts. Really, 2021 in particular feels like the first time in quite a while that the general narrative surrounding celebrity is one of weary sympathy, a keen understanding that being famous is more likely to lead to misery than joy. From #FreeBritney to the exposing of Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s nastiness to the Sussex exit from royal life, we\u2019ve been surrounded by examples of how the previously accepted cruelties of celebrity life are being roundly called out or even rejected. Even the media outlets that proudly profited from this nastiness are eating crow and admitting their mistakes. Well, sort of. The point is that now, more than ever, we have the time and understanding to look back on our collective mistakes, call them out, and hopefully improve things for the next generation.\nI write a newsletter dedicated to examining vintage celebrity gossip and reporting (subscribe now!), which means I spend way too much time reading immensely creepy profiles of famous women written by leering dudes. My most recent issue focused on an Esquire cover piece of Jessica Biel that often read like it was written by a serial killer. I could be here all day dissecting the ways that male-oriented publications have objectified women and the slow evolution of that trend. Instead, I want to dig into something that is, bizarrely, far nastier than even those screeds.\nIn 2007, Maxim, a men\u2019s magazine, shared the illustrious winners of their annual Hot 100 list, dedicated to \u2018celebrating\u2019 the sexiest women of that year. This time, first place was occupied by Lindsay Lohan, followed by Jessica Alba, Scarlett Johansson, and Christina Aguilera. That same year, they introduced another list, this one on the \u2018Unsexiest Women Alive.\u2019 Five women were named. Britney Spears was slated for \u2018filling chicken-grease-stained sweatpants on the cover of every trashy tabloid and gossip blog on the Internet\u2019 and having \u2018gained two kids, two useless ex-husbands, and about 23 pounds of Funyun pudge.\u2019 Madonna was mocked for her \u2018rapid postnuptial deterioration\u2019 and compared to Willem Dafoe. Sandra Oh, star of a series described as \u2018a show about doctors is a show about sappy chick doctors we\u00b4re forced to watch or else our girlfriends won\u00b4t have sex with us\u2019, was nicknamed \u2018Dr. McSkinny\u2019 with a \u2018cold bedside manner and boyish figure.\u2019 Amy Winehouse was picked apart for \u2018her openly hemorrhaging translucent skin, rat\u00b4s nest mane and lashes that look more like surgically attached bats.\u2019 The top spot went to Sarah Jessica Parker, who was called a \u2018Barbaro-faced broad\u2019 and compared to Secretariat.\nShockingly enough, none of this is available on Maxim\u2019s website anymore, but the entire list has been copied to multiple sites over the past 14 years.\nEven at the time, this list was considered shockingly poor taste and stunningly sexist. The same outlets who repeatedly tore into Spears and Winehouse, two troubled women evidently struggling with mental and addiction issues, drew the line with Maxim. Parker talked openly about how much the Maxim piece hurt her. Maxim then tried to make up for it \u2014 I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m calling this \u2014 by naming Parker their \u2018unexpected crush\u2019 in 2008. No news on whether or not Parker told them to shove it in response.\nI wanted to talk about this whole mess because it got me thinking about the ways that the continued misogyny of the press has evolved over the past two decades or so. We could be here for weeks talking about the entire history of celebrity coverage, but in terms of how the internet has shaped our understanding of it, there\u2019s so much to mine. 2007 was a period of transition for gossip and celebrity-related reporting. MySpace was king and Twitter was the new baby of Jack Dorsey and pals that nobody outside of Silicon Valley had heard of. The blogs were highly caustic, with Perez Hilton the undisputed king of the crop thanks to his gleefully cruel posts. The dominant figures, however, were still magazines and TV, from People and Us Weekly to Entertainment Tonight and Inside Edition. This was a point in pop culture where celebrity coverage was wall-to-wall, consumed by the masses, and extremely profitable.\nThis was also the time of the new age of reality TV stars and the \u2018all grown up\u2019 child actors who partied hard. For a brief period, it was impossible to avoid paparazzi shots of Paris, Britney, and Lindsay hopping from bar to bar. The women were hugely sexualized and positioned as worthy of our scorn. Their weight was mocked or held up as a disgrace to all women, even though that level of skinniness remained aspirational content for practically every fashion house. Everyone engaged in this circle of human bear-baiting, with this handful of women held up as the acceptable targets. The word \u2018trainwreck\u2019 had never been more utilized in the media vernacular. It\u2019s no surprise that Maxim felt like they were on safe ground by making that list. Why would they think they\u2019d be singled out for doing what everyone else was?\nMaxim\u2019s harshness here is at least honest with its sadistic intentions. They want to be mean. This is typical of the fratty tone of many men\u2019s magazines from this era, near-identical to the sleazier rhetoric of \u2018lads\u2019 mags\u2019 but with glossier photography. I have a painfully strong memory of one of the more popular British women\u2019s weeklies doing a front cover on the \u2018muffin tops\u2019 of celebrities, which it then defended as a display of body positivity. Tell that to your cover artists who used graphics that pointed to women\u2019s stomachs as if they were crime scenes. There seemed to be an entire ecosystem of D-List British celebrities whose endless cycle of weight loss victory and gaining \u2018shame\u2019 offered regular content for such publications. Even now, as the glossies embrace the most diluted and capitalism-friendly version of body positivity (white, cis, hourglass-shaped, seldom over a size 16), it\u2019s not as though they\u2019ve dropped the diet talk or scrutiny over others\u2019 forms. Maxim derided Amy Winehouse and Britney Spears\u2019s bodies but so did all of the women\u2019s mags. Insults towards the latter were often accompanied with denigrating comments about her parenting abilities or near-cackling reminders of how far she\u2019d \u2018fallen.\u2019 They would pretend these issues were about encouraging a \u2018balanced debate\u2019 by selectively publishing readers\u2019 letters that acted as though a changing body was worthy of \u2018both sides\u2019 equivalences.\nMaxim positioned itself as just highbrow enough to separate itself from the plethora of lads\u2019 mags that polluted the shelves in the late \u201990s and early 2000s. Imagine a stopgap between GQ \u2014 expensive, conservative, metropolitan \u2014 and Nuts \u2014 crude, brash, more obsessed with nipples. As the label suggests, such magazines were for \u2018lads\u2019, which generally means working-class, 20-something, obsessed with football and boobs and an aspirational sort of masculinity. Raunch was front and center, as it was in tabloid newspapers thanks to Page 3. The tone was that of the ultimate guys\u2019 night out, one of hedonistic freedom and zero consequences. And boobs. Seriously, I cannot overstate just how breast-obsessed this entire era was. I remember the \u2018war\u2019 of cosmetic enhancements between Katie Price and Jodie Marsh, and how giddily covered it was by magazines for both men and women.\nOne magazine, Loaded, even bragged that its entire aim was \u2018the pursuit of sex, drink, football and less serious matters.\u2019 Its founder, James Brown, said he set up the magazine for \u2018my mates who liked music, clubbing, women, comedy and football.\u2019 There was certainly a gap in the market for a brand of male-oriented media that didn\u2019t focus entirely on the monied, but often these magazines felt like mean parodies of working-class masculinity. Women were treated as sex objects on those pages, but it\u2019s not as though men were seen as three-dimensional beings either. I don\u2019t say that to excuse their misogyny but merely to point out how the stark gender binary offered by money-driven media is reinforced. They all made money from denigrating women, even the ones made for us.\nThe era of the so-called lads\u2019 mag is basically over, but its influence is evident. Especially in Britain, the sheer force of their particular strain of sexist banter has simply found pride of place online. Mostly, changes in publishing and marketing forced those blokey sites to take a new direction. LADbible started out with sexist content such as Cleavage Thursday but quickly changed to run-of-the-mill viral content and Buzzfeed-esque Facebook feed filler once it realized how to game the system. According to a 2015 piece by the Financial Times, magazines like Nuts and Maxim saw losses of over 80% to their readership. You can get boobs for free online and a Reddit thread full of all the misogyny you desire.\n14 years on from the Unsexiest Women Alive piece, I wonder how much has truly changed. The British edition of Vogue thoroughly entered the 21st-century thanks to editor Edward Enninful\u2019s diversification of its staff and content. Even the most watered-down version of body positivity and money-friendly intersectionality offers the briefest glimmers of evolution to media. As with all things in this field, change is slow and maddeningly incremental. I doubt we\u2019ll ever see a list like this again in print but check the clickbait ads on any site and you\u2019ll find a barrage of shock-horror over actresses who have dared to age publicly or former cover girls who no longer have six-packs. There is still a lot of cash to be made here. Misogyny is endlessly profitable. Nowadays, it\u2019s just glossier than ever."

News.\n\u201cI recall sitting down with her and her mother for dinner at the Russian Tea Room, and I don\u2019t know if it was my blue Vanson leather motorcycle jacket (which I still have) or my sinusitis, but I didn\u2019t hear from her again.\u201d\nCage\u2019s admission comes just days after the \u201cAnd Just Like That\u201d star revealed that she had dated the \u201cNational Treasure\u201d actor around the time of their 1992 rom-com \u201cHoneymoon in Vegas.\u201d\nDuring an appearance on \u201cWatch What Happens Live\u201d Sunday, host Andy Cohen quizzed the actress, 60, on her former fling.\n\u201cDid you date Nic Cage?\u201d the Bravo honcho, 57, asked his longtime friend.\n\u201cUm, yes, I did,\u201d she answered. \u201cYes, I did.\u201d\n\u201cOh wow,\u201d said Cohen, joking that they had \u201csome talking to do.\u201d\nParker and Cage first sparked dating rumors in 1991 while filming their romantic comedy.\nHowever, the pair\u2019s romance didn\u2019t stand the test of time as Parker soon found love with Matthew Broderick the following year.\nThe actress, who played Carrie Bradshaw in \u201cSATC,\u201d went on to tie the knot with the \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u201d star in May 1997.\nThe pair are now parents to three kids: son James, 22, and twin daughters Tabitha and Marion, 16.\nElsewhere during her appearance on \u201cWWHL,\u201d Parker was asked \u201chow and when\u201d she knew that Broderick was \u201cthe one.\u201d\nThe actress admitted that she knew she loved him \u201cpretty early\u201d on after \u201cjust spending a little bit of time with him.\u201d\n\u201cI remember I had to leave to go on location to shoot a movie.

It could be sitting right there on their bank statement.\nForget lipstick on the collar \u2014 suspicious ATM withdrawals might be the real smoking gun.\n\u201cWe\u2019re basically a cashless society these days, so if your partner has always been about tap-and-go, using a credit card for reward points and suddenly starts doing ATM withdrawals \u2013 that\u2019s a bread crumb worth following,\u201d private investigator Cassie Crofts explained on TikTok.\nWhy? \u201cCash doesn\u2019t leave a trail,\u201d Crofts said. \u201cIf they go to a restaurant and spend $200, you can be pretty sure they weren\u2019t dining solo. But $200 cash withdrawal? You\u2019ve got no idea what happened.\u201d\nBrothel manager Catherine De Noire says the location \u2014 and the timing \u2014 of those withdrawals can be even more damning.\n\u201cThe first thing is that a lot of guys don\u2019t carry enough cash. So then they go and withdraw money from an ATM, which is usually somewhere near the brothel or inside the brothel,\u201d she said on Instagram, as reported by The Tab.\n\u201cThis is very suspicious, especially when you see that your partner withdraws a lot of money at 4 am in the morning in this area, and the account is a shared one.\u201d\nBottom line: If your joint account suddenly starts hemorrhaging twenties in the wee hours, it might be time for a serious talk.\nAnd while money might be the most obvious tell, it\u2019s not the only household item that can turn snitch.\nAs The Post previously reported, one woman discovered her husband\u2019s alleged infidelity thanks to a very unlikely source \u2014 their digital scale.\nIn a now-viral Reddit post, a wife using the handle u/throw-Doubt303 claimed she uncovered late-night weigh-ins on their shared scale \u2014 while she was out of town and her husband was supposedly home alone.\n\u201cI checked the digital scale\u2019s memory out of curiosity and it showed two \u2018unassigned\u2019 weigh-ins at exactly 120 lbs, logged at 12:25 a.m. and 12:26 a.m. back-to-back,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFor context, I do not weigh 120 lbs, and I was not there on that date, just my husband.\u201d\n\u201cThe goal was to work on ourselves to help build a better foundation and we agreed not to see other people,\u201d she added in the comments.\nRedditors didn\u2019t mince words. \u201cPro tip \u2014 don\u2019t tell him you know there was a female there. Get in touch with attorneys to make a game plan,\u201d one advised.\n\u201cThis is two back-to-back weights. This is pretty simple. He has moved on and is already hooking up with other women. No need to overthink this,\u201d another said.\nOne commenter praised the find: \u201cThis is expert-level sleuthing. Men underestimate our level of intuition. When you confront him, he\u2019ll probably try to paint you as crazy or paranoid. You\u2019re not.\u201d\nIn other words: if you\u2019re looking for clues, don\u2019t just follow the money \u2014 follow the ounces."
