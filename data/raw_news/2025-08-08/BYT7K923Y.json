  "description": "Here's how to catch this weekend's Cubs at Cardinals series, an August brew of historic hostilities.",
  "content": "The Chicago Cubs were once baseball\u2019s buzziest and highest-scoring team. After an underwhelming trade deadline and a middling summer, they\u2019re now in need of a second heat wave to get back atop their division. This weekend\u2019s three-game set with the St. Louis Cardinals is a prime opportunity to spark something, or at least preheat the clubhouse for a stretch run. St. Louis can play spoiler to its archrival and get above .500 with a home series win.\n\nHow to watch Chicago Cubs at St. Louis Cardinals\n\u2022 Watching in person? Get tickets on StubHub.\n\nFox is also available over the air. \u201cSunday Night Baseball\u201d is also available with an ESPN+ subscription.\n\nChicago scored just three runs across Monday and Tuesday losses to Cincinnati, but got right by plating six and winning Wednesday. That was similar to how things played out against Milwaukee the week before: seven runs in Monday-Tuesday losses, then a 10-run eruption to avoid the sweep. The offense struggled against Baltimore in last weekend\u2019s games, too, though Justin Turner\u2019s walk-off lifted the Cubs to a series W:\n\nSt. Louis made its intentions clear with a controlled selloff at the deadline, but it still took two of three from the defending champion Dodgers in Chavez Ravine. It was the Cardinals\u2019 first series win since July 8-10 versus Washington. All things considered, bringing a 58-58 record into Friday\u2019s action is kind of wild.\n\nThe visitors are set to throw two lefties this weekend: Matthew Boyd (11\u20134, 2.34 ERA) starts things off, and Shota Imanaga (8\u20134, 3.12 ERA) is the finale\u2019s probable. Friday\u2019s showdown is on MLB Network for viewers outside the Cubs\u2019 and Cardinals\u2019 markets. It\u2019s also one of St. Louis\u2019 free over-the-air Fridays, so locals can just hit channel 4. Most of the country can watch Saturday\u2019s game on Fox \u2014 Washington state, Texas and the Northeast get Phillies at Rangers. The series wraps up on the main stage of ESPN\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Baseball.\u201d\n\nCardinals right-handed ace Sonny Gray (10\u20135, 4.21 ERA) is scheduled to match Imanaga in that one. His fastball comes in below league averages, but he\u2019s in the 99 percentile for walk rate, and gets batters to chase at his seven-pitch stock.\n\n\u201cFor months now, McGwire and Sosa had pushed each other toward the old limits, had recognized each other as comrades. The whole baseball world recognized something good in the way they saluted each other. Some people thought Sosa was playing mind games when he deferred to McGwire, but he was merely reflecting the gut knowledge of the arena, the way baseball players always knew Mickey Mantle was \u2018the man\u2019 in his league and Willie Mays was \u2018the man\u2019 in his league, way back when. McGwire was almost expected to challenge 60, 61, 62 this season, and he did it first. Then Sosa roared right along with him.\u201d \u2014 George Vecsey\n\n\u201cHrabosky had recently adopted an elaborate pre-pitch ritual. He called it the \u2018psych-up,\u2019 and over the years it became the signature of his carefully crafted on-field persona. The routine helped with focus. It also enraged opponents. Most countered by stepping out of the box. But believing this to be an insufficient up-yours, Madlock retreated all the way to the on-deck circle, even doing so more than once until the umpire decided he\u2019d had enough. Crawford followed Madlock and ordered him to hit. Marshall protested and the umpire humored him, though this d\u00e9tente proved fleeting. The short fuse had already been lit \u2026\u201d \u2014 Marc Carig\u2019s excellent retrospective on the brawl that beat back time.\n\nMost home runs in both jerseys\n\nBetting/odds, ticketing and streaming links in this article are provided by partners of The Athletic.

      "text": "CHICAGO \u2014 Less than 24 hours after the only starting pitcher he acquired at the trade deadline exited with an injury, Cubs team president Jed Hoyer stood by the acquisition of Michael Soroka.\n\u201cWe make bets on human beings,\u201d Hoyer told reporters Tuesday afternoon at Wrigley Field. \u201cSometimes they work out. I haven\u2019t gotten the full report yet, but obviously disappointed. We did a lot of due diligence, a ton of research. If it doesn\u2019t work, that\u2019s on me. That\u2019s the job.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nAfter tossing two innings of one-run ball on Monday, Soroka didn\u2019t come out for the third. The right-hander complained of shoulder pain that he felt after rearing back for \u201ca little extra\u201d on a pitch in the previous inning. On Tuesday, the Cubs placed Soroka on the injured list and called up reliever Nate Pearson.\n\u201cLow- to mid-grade shoulder strain,\u201d manager Craig Counsell said. \u201cBasically, (we) anticipate shutting him down for seven to 10 days and then kind of reevaluating where we\u2019re at. So all in all, not terrible news. I think we\u2019ll have a pretty good idea of what\u2019s going on in a week and kind of go from there.\u201d\nThe news on Soroka wasn\u2019t terrible, but things got worse for the team on the field as they dropped their second straight game to the Cincinnati Reds.\nIn a 5-1 loss, Shota Imanaga was brilliant for 6 1/3 innings, but Andrew Kittredge couldn\u2019t keep the game knotted as he retired just one batter in the seventh while giving up four runs, his first bad appearance as a Cub since being acquired at the deadline.\nThe main culprit remains the offense. The group continues to confound of late. A day after Counsell lamented that three hits wouldn\u2019t win many games, the Cubs showed that four hits wouldn\u2019t do any better.\nThe first inning summed things up nicely. After Michael Busch and Ian Happ reached to put two men on with no outs, Kyle Tucker, Pete Crow-Armstrong and Willi Castro struck out in succession against starter Zack Littell, who entered the game with a meager 16.6 percent strikeout rate.\nFor an offense that\u2019s carried the team for much of the season, the Cubs\u2019 hitters are suddenly searching for answers as the best players have all struggled to produce.\n\u201cThe name of the game is to square the ball up, get on base and create rallies,\u201d Counsell said. \u201cYou gotta do it in all sorts of situations and all times of the year. We\u2019re just in a little run right now and we\u2019re not doing it. This is a very good offensive baseball team. It will happen. You never enjoy going through stretches like this. When you\u2019re slumping, you kind of feel like you\u2019re pressing because you\u2019re not getting any good results. We\u2019ve just got some guys not in great places swinging the bat right now. We\u2019ll get \u2019em there.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe scuffling offense only puts more of a spotlight on Hoyer, who frustrated many by not getting a big-name starter at the deadline. His assertion that an impact starter wasn\u2019t moved is fair, and he was right in the assessment that prices to acquire pitchers were sky high. But the optics of the Soroka news only heighten the angst.\nSoroka\u2019s injury can\u2019t come as much of a surprise. The veteran righty has battled injuries throughout his career, including multiple shoulder issues even as recently as last summer. There was also a concerning trend with his velocity.\n\u201cWe knew the velocity was sort of trending down,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cWe obviously talked through that extensively. Felt like given the market, given the asking price and given all those things, we felt like it was a good bet to make. Ultimately, he came out of the game last night and right now it\u2019s not looking like a good bet.\u201d\nThe bet was likely on the fact that Soroka came to the Cubs with a 25.4 percent strikeout rate and a 7 percent walk rate. That strikeout rate would easily lead Chicago\u2019s rotation. He was also moving from the Washington Nationals, who had one of the worst defenses in baseball, to a team with top defenders at every position. He may not have been an innings-eater, but the front office saw upside with him.\nKnowing his velocity had dipped, the Cubs were paying close attention to Soroka\u2019s health records. They knew he underwent an MRI before his final start. They scrutinized his medicals and debated the best course of action on a pitcher they liked.\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time on that,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cEarlier, he was sitting at a much higher velocity. It was kind of coming down and we trying to get to the bottom of exactly what that was. He\u2019d had the MRI before that. That risk profile was known and we decided that given the asking price and that we felt like he was notch above some of the other guys we were talking about in terms of talent and development opportunities, we thought it was the right risk.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nTaking risks can pay off, obviously. That\u2019s how the Cubs ended up with Matthew Boyd. Of course, when they added him, he was trending in the right direction over the final months of 2024, making it a smart bet. Soroka\u2019s trends were concerning. And for now, that risk isn\u2019t looking like it will pay off.\nCounsell said Ben Brown, who relieved Soroka on Monday and allowed just one run in four innings, was an option to make starts. Javier Assad could also return after his next rehab outing on Wednesday. Jameson Taillon will make his second rehab start on Friday with Triple-A Iowa. The Cubs also have an off day on Thursday and Monday, allowing them some flexibility with how they attack the fifth-starter spot.\nNone of it will matter if the team doesn\u2019t start to score on a consistent basis again.\nThe Cubs still have a 65-48 record, tied with the Philadelphia Phillies for third-best in the National League. The problem remains that they\u2019re in a division with a Milwaukee Brewers team that has repeatedly defied the odds as they continue a months-long torrid stretch. They\u2019ve now extended their lead to four games in the division as they put pressure on a Cubs team that appears to be wilting.\nThe assumption is that the bats will eventually wake up. What\u2019s unknown is when it will happen and whether it will be too late.\n(Top photo of Michael Soroka: David Banks / Imagn Images)"

      "text": "Former St. Louis Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina will be in uniform as a member of the major-league coaching staff for the team\u2019s upcoming three-game series against the Chicago Cubs, manager Oli Marmol said Friday. It will be Molina\u2019s first public appearance as a member of the organization since he retired in 2022.\nAlbert Pujols on the unspoken connection he had with Yadier Molina when back-picking runners at first base! pic.twitter.com/q7wam9TA5t\n\u2014 MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) May 19, 2025\nMolina\u2019s return comes during a trying time for the organization. The Cardinals\u2019 transition season resulted in a sell-off at the trade deadline, with the club\u2019s future uncertain. Mozeliak will step down at the end of the year, and current advisor Chaim Bloom \u2014 who will take over as president of baseball operations \u2014 has already placed a firm focus on investing in player development and the minor leagues, but it remains to be seen what Bloom\u2019s plan for the major-league team will be in 2026.\nAdvertisement\nMolina has been candid about his desire to manage in MLB and will manage Team Puerto Rico for the second time in next year\u2019s World Baseball Classic. Marmol has one year remaining on his contract. With a new front office coming in, speculation over their skipper\u2019s future is bound to happen, though the Cardinals have given no indication they will make a managerial change.\nMarmol is aware of the outside noise, but that won\u2019t deter him from ensuring Molina can be around the team.\n\u201cAnytime you get the chance to have someone like Yadi around your players, you take it,\u201d Marmol said. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer. The experience, the leadership, the presence he brings \u2014 it impacts everyone. As soon as I heard he was going to be in town, inviting him to sit next to me was the right move. It\u2019s good for the players, good for the staff, and honestly, it\u2019s great for the fans too.\u201d\nMolina has limited his public appearances since his retirement. He has returned to Busch Stadium just once, when longtime battery-mate Adam Wainwright retired in 2023. The Cardinals hired Molina as a special advisor to Mozeliak before the 2024 season, but Molina was notably absent from the organization.\nThe 10-time All-Star acknowledged his time away from the Cardinals to The Athletic in March, citing a need to be around his family \u2014 especially his 16-year-old son Yanuell, who recently committed to playing college baseball at The University of Texas at Arlington. Molina also recognized how his prolonged absence could raise concerns with fans, and expressed hope he\u2019d be able to return to St. Louis at some point this season.\n\u201cI would love to be there,\u201d Molina said during spring training. \u201cI would love to teach and coach the catchers \u2026 But right now my priority is to be with my family.\n\u201cI wish life was different for me to be there with the organization and in the city. And I hope that comes soon because I really miss it.\u201d\nYadier Molina has been named Team Puerto Rico's manager for the 2026 World Baseball Classic! pic.twitter.com/kNrANHEFFA\n\u2014 MLB (@MLB) June 18, 2025\nMolina won\u2019t have a set role with the club over the weekend, though he\u2019s sure to work with catchers Pedro Pag\u00e9s and Yohel Pozo.

      "text": "The chaos peaks just before the first punch is thrown. On the grainy footage, home plate looks like a clown car, with five angry men packed into a space for three.\nThere was Shag Crawford, whose short fuse was a virtue when umpires ruled the field like despots. He was behind Ted Simmons, the Cardinals catcher who paved his road to Cooperstown with tenacity. There was Cubs third baseman Bill Madlock, a future four-time batting champ known as \u201cMad Dog.\u201d His legs were splayed. His bat was coiled. He was ready to swing. But so was his teammate, Jos\u00e9 Cardenal, the second man in the batter\u2019s box, maximum occupancy of one. An arm\u2019s length away was another man out of place, Jim Marshall, the red-faced manager of the Cubs, who doesn\u2019t know that a scuffle is about to knock off his toupee.\nAdvertisement\nIt was the top of the ninth on Sept. 22, 1974, a sunny Sunday afternoon in St. Louis. The score was tied, 5-5. The Cardinals were locked in a pennant race and the rival Cubs were locked in the basement. Nevertheless, it was Marshall who helped initiate the mayhem. A few moments earlier, he had stormed out of his dugout to complain about Al Hrabosky, the Cardinals relief ace who would be remembered as \u201cThe Mad Hungarian.\u201d\nHrabosky had recently adopted an elaborate pre-pitch ritual. He called it the \u201cpsych-up,\u201d and over the years it became the signature of his carefully crafted on-field persona. The routine helped with focus. It also enraged opponents. Most countered by stepping out of the box. But believing this to be an insufficient up-yours, Madlock retreated all the way to the on-deck circle, even doing so more than once until the umpire decided he\u2019d had enough. Crawford followed Madlock and ordered him to hit. Marshall protested and the umpire humored him, though this d\u00e9tente proved fleeting. The short fuse had already been lit.\nIn an escalation that would make Joe West blush, Crawford turned his back on the still-ranting Marshall before marching to home plate, where he pulled down his mask, dropped into his crouch, and motioned emphatically to Hrabosky, who obliged with a face-high fastball that the umpire called a strike \u2014 mostly in deference to the rule book, and partly in deference to spite \u2014 all while the manager stood with his hands on his hips, near a batter\u2019s box that was left unoccupied, a mistake that the Cubs weren\u2019t about to make twice.\nCardenal jumped into the box. It wasn\u2019t his turn to hit. Madlock scrambled to join him. Hrabosky fired again. Heater, up and in. Cardenal cocked his bat as if to swing. Madlock reeled, nearly falling backward. Marshall, still arguing nearby, was nearly beaned. The crowd gasped and booed and hissed. In the broadcast booth, the exasperated announcer summoned the earnestness of Jimmy Stewart.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWow!\u201d he yelled. \u201cThis is the strangest thing I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d\nSimmons stood up from his crouch. What followed, according to Dick Kaegel\u2019s report in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, was a brief but forceful exchange.\n\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Simmons said.\n\u201cGet lost,\u201d Madlock shot back.\nSimmons unleashed a right hook to Madlock\u2019s chin. On video, the scene devolved into a low-fi blur of bodies, fists and, if memory is to be trusted, an angry manager\u2019s airborne toupee.\nThe brawl was Jerry Springer before Jerry Springer, staged when the uniforms were powder blue, the Astroturf was lime green, and the asses were red. If it had happened today, it would be dissected ad nauseam on television, disseminated instantly to smart phones, and described in unsparing detail in one of Jomboy\u2019s Internet-famous breakdowns. A full-blown melee thanks to the escalation of an umpire? This alone would be grist for the Hot Take Industrial Complex.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the great fights right there,\u201d Keith Hernandez says, his eyes trained on his No. 18, a peacemaker in the middle of the scrum. He\u2019s never seen this video before. Now each viewing leaves him oohing and aahing like a titillated middle schooler. He was a Cardinals rookie then, and he had witnessed the drama unfold from his position at first base, just 90 feet away. He had one of the best seats in the house. Years later, he would remember almost none of it.\nSays Hernandez: \u201cI\u2019m just amazed that I forgot that.\u201d\nThis is absolute chaos pic.twitter.com/vIH4wjft0X\n\u2014 Jomboy Media (@JomboyMedia) September 8, 2021\nTo those indoctrinated into baseball, there are images that form shared memory. There\u2019s Babe Ruth, cigar in mouth, blowing smoke beneath his Home Run King crown. There\u2019s Willie Mays, back turned and cap flying, in hot pursuit of a deep drive. There\u2019s Carlton Fisk earning his doctorate in Body English, and Nolan Ryan using Robin Ventura\u2019s head like a punching bag, and Kirk Gibson, impossibly and improbably, hobbling all the way home. \u201cIf it gets refreshed \u2014 any kind of memory \u2014 the more it can get ingrained,\u201d says Jason Themanson, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Illinois Wesleyan University. Researchers call this process \u201crehearsal.\u201d It is key to determining what will be committed to memory, and conversely, what gets lost.\nAdvertisement\nRehearsal can take on many forms. It can be a framed photo hanging in a conspicuous place, as it was for the prominent political reporter, whose backdrop was Jason Varitek serving his catcher\u2019s mitt to \u00c1lex Rodr\u00edguez like an amuse-bouche. It can be team merchandise commemorating a championship run, the kind handed out during champagne celebrations, and hawked on TV immediately after the final out. And, especially this time of year, it can be classic highlights shown during broadcasts of the World Series. Says Martin Safer, psychology professor emeritus at Catholic University, \u201cIt\u2019s this rehearsal, this thinking about it, that seems to make a big difference.\u201d\nSo too does perceived importance, another factor central to memory. Years ago, with the help of a colleague, Safer conducted a study that focused on the Yankees and Red Sox. They gauged how accurately fans could recall the deciding games of the 2003 and 2004 American League Championship Series, the former won by the Yankees and the latter by the Red Sox. Fans of the winning team, they found, retained the most details. Victory made the games important enough to rehearse, and therefore, to remember.\nClarity plays a role as well, one of the reasons behind the enduring lore of the Pine Tar Incident. When George Brett charged out of the dugout, arms flailing, neck veins bulging, the camera was perfectly placed to capture his fury. He filled the center of the frame. The scene requires little explanation. It\u2019s easy to recall. \u201cIf the message gets muddled with what was actually going on there, if it\u2019s not described cleanly, if you don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on, sometimes it\u2019s hard to remember or communicate or share a memory with other people,\u201d Themanson says. \u201cThe collective memory fades away.\u201d\nMore than a century of research has established that memory is fraught with complications. Recollections need help to endure. Enough material must exist to prompt rehearsal; enough people must deem it worthy to preserve. For many years, the fight had neither, and time worked unimpeded to push it into the darkness.\nDuring the rabbit-eared days of television in 1974, there were far fewer chances for the fight to be replayed. The transformational \u201cThis Week in Baseball\u201d was still three years away from being broadcast for the first time. ESPN was five years away from launching. The modern-day highlight had yet to be born. Even if it had, satellite technology did not exist to make them easily distributed and, ultimately, ubiquitous. It didn\u2019t help that the scene was so chaotic that it defied easy explanation.\nThere were no content creators to gawk at how Madlock was punched so hard that it left Simmons with bloody knuckles. There were no talking heads to discuss the vicious flying body block that Simmons absorbed from behind courtesy of Andre Thornton, the slugging Cubs first baseman everyone called \u201cThunder.\u201d There were no spirited debates on studio shows about Hrabosky\u2019s rage-inducing, baseball-slamming, mustache-wearing Mad Hungarian act, and whether condoning it was tantamount to letting the kids play or letting the kids get away with disrespecting the game.\nNewspapers across the country published recaps of the brawl, some with a wire photo of Simmons decking Madlock. A few weeks later, in a segment recapping the regular season, NBC aired the incident during a World Series pregame show. This was the extent of the fallout.\nAdvertisement\nThat any video of the fight existed at all was a matter of serendipity.\nBy the 1970s, teams began seeing the value of televising their games. But the Cardinals scaled back on home broadcasts under orders from owner Gussie Busch, who feared that giving away the product for free would put a dent in his gate receipts. When it came to footage of the Cardinals, the policy led to a Dark Age.\nPeople like Gerard Grimm would discover this years later, when they\u2019d comb through the archives and find that highlights of Simmons in a Cardinals uniform were relatively scarce. \u201cThere\u2019s just this large gap,\u201d says Grimm, a history buff and lifelong Cardinals fan. That gap covered the 1974 season, when the Cardinals aired just 29 of their games, all on the road. By contrast, the Cubs broadcast 148 games, including one from a strange Sunday afternoon in St. Louis. But even if the full game had been recorded, it was always more likely to be lost to history.\nTapes in those days were expensive and commonly reused. They were also bulky. To save space, they were often thrown out. This might have been the fate of the fight if not for dumb luck and random curiosity.\n\u201cI told that story for years,\u201d says Kaegel, the Hall of Fame baseball writer, who still laughs when considering the absurdity of the scene. For nearly four decades, this is how the fight lived on, only in the minds of the few who bothered remembering. For most others, the memory faded, even for those with an interest in keeping it top of mind.\nHrabosky\u2019s post-playing days included a long stretch as a color commentator on Cardinals television broadcasts, where tales from the good old days are standard fodder. \u201cHe would talk about all kinds of things,\u201d says Grimm, who in that time religiously watched Cardinals games. \u201cBut never once do I remember him talking about this game.\u201d From his own recollection, Hrabosky says he was seldom asked about the incident.\nPerhaps there wasn\u2019t much to say. While Crawford\u2019s conduct would be beyond the pale today, back then it would have hardly merited outrage. Umpires were expected to rule the field. Then there was the confrontation itself, which wouldn\u2019t have been a lock to receive the Mel Allen treatment. \u201cTo me, it was pretty much a standard baseball fight, and I\u2019ve seen hundreds of them, as you can well imagine,\u201d says Geoff Belinfante, the longtime producer of \u201cThis Week in Baseball.\u201d \u201cTo me, that particular fight wasn\u2019t memorable.\u201d It wasn\u2019t even the most vicious of that summer. That distinction belonged to a free-for-all in Arlington, Texas, where the Rangers\u2019 Lenny Randle drag-bunted for the sole purpose of tackling Indians pitcher Bob Johnson. Even the cranky umpire Crawford had seen worse. He was behind home plate in 1965 when the Giants\u2019 Juan Marichal clubbed the Dodgers\u2019 Johnny Roseboro over the head with a bat.\nAdvertisement\nThe image of five angry men remained trapped in purgatory, a slice of baseball history that was neither destroyed nor discovered. So it stayed for decades until it was scooped up by people who weren\u2019t looking for it. The Media Burn Archive was created by a Chicago television producer who sought to preserve mountains of old tape. That cache included a spring training special called \u201cA Look at the Cubs, 1975.\u201d It was archived only because it featured a 16-second interview with former pitcher Steve Stone, which the producer later used in another project. The show also included something else: 1 minute, 6 seconds of a fight that could now be saved from the dustbin of time.\nIn the summer of 2013, \u201cA Look at the Cubs, 1975\u201d was digitized and uploaded, along with its treasure, now hidden in the open like a bonus track. It was discovered a few months later by Grimm, the lifelong Cardinals fan, who was always on the lookout for old footage of his favorite team. At the time, Grimm kept a blog called Kinescope Steals Home, a reference to the recording technology used in the early days of television. He wrote that he\u2019d been tipped off about the footage, though he hadn\u2019t viewed it right away. But once he wound up on the Media Burn site, he knew he\u2019d watched something worth remembering. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d Grimm says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that the umpire just continued the game with multiple players on the field and a couple of people in the batter\u2019s box.\u201d\nAs would happen thousands of times since that day \u2014 with thousands of other people \u2014 Grimm found himself wondering how he had never seen the fight. \u201cYou see that clip of A-Rod and Varitek all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019d think that every time the Cubs and Cardinals play that this would be one of the clips that they show in a bumper highlight or that kind of thing, but I guess not.\u201d\nGrimm searched online for a clear explanation of the incident. When he didn\u2019t find what he was looking for, he filled the void himself. He used the video to capture still images of the madness. He rifled through newspaper archives to reconstruct the lead-up to the fight. By the time he was done, he hadn\u2019t just produced another piece of content for the internet to consume and cannibalize. His blog post provided context that was critical to make sense out of chaos.\nHe couldn\u2019t have known it yet, but Grimm had helped to pull a piece of baseball history back from the darkness.\nThe trouble began on the pitcher\u2019s mound. In those days this was not uncommon with the Mad Hungarian. \u201cAl always got everybody pissed,\u201d says Hernandez, whose position at first base provided an up-close view of the pitcher\u2019s antics. Baseball had long been a game of straitlaced conformity. So when Hrabosky adopted a persona better suited for professional wrestling, it was noticed. For most of his 13 seasons in the big leagues, he embraced being a heel.\nHrabosky also lived his gimmick. He grew out his bushy hair and droopy mustache, then protested loudly when management demanded that he shave. Once, while shirtless near the batting cage before a game, he had to be restrained after unleashing a torrent of obscenities in a tussle with a reporter. It was straight out of the Vince McMahon playbook before there was one. But what put Hrabosky\u2019s act over the top was that he could actually pitch. \u201cIt was not pleasant to face him because he was good,\u201d says Rick Monday, the longtime Dodgers broadcaster who played with the Cubs in 1974. \u201cHe may have had some shtick \u2014 I\u2019m certain he\u2019s never referred to it as that \u2014 but he also had the ability to back it up. You had to take him seriously with what he was going to throw at you. Just couldn\u2019t get mesmerized by the shtick.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe shtick consisted of his \u201cpsych-up.\u201d Before throwing a pitch, he would walk toward second base, lower his head, and slam the baseball into his glove. \u201cThen,\u201d Monday says, \u201che\u2019d turn around like he was going to eat a rhinoceros.\u201d\nBatters hated it.\n\u201cWhat it ultimately achieved was that a guy would go to bat 600 times, and four or five times a year he\u2019d face me, and those four or five times, he\u2019d never thought about situational hitting, never thought about game action,\u201d Hrabosky says. \u201cAll he wanted to do was knock my head off.\u201d\nOne night against the Mets, Hrabosky irked the feared slugger Dave Kingman. \u201cKing Kong\u201d got his vengeance by launching a moonshot into the upper deck. \u201cHe watched,\u201d Hernandez says, \u201cand then he motherfucked Al all the way around the bases.\u201d Another time, Hrabosky got the Pirates so worked up that they turned on each other. Late in a close game, Bill Robinson reached base and set about distracting the pitcher. Every time Hrabosky finished his routine, Robinson asked for time to tie his shoes. Exasperated after watching several rounds of this from the batter\u2019s box, Al Oliver began screaming. \u201cStop tying your fucking shoes!\u201d Hernandez recalls hearing. \u201cStop that! I wanna hit!\u201d\nHrabosky adopted the psych-up shortly before his infamous skirmish against the Cubs. Fearing that he\u2019d be sent to the minors, he sought a method to channel his focus. The tactic worked. By September, the Cardinals were holding off the Pirates in the National League East, and Hrabosky emerged as a weapon in the bullpen. That the routine annoyed his opponents was merely a bonus. \u201cIt was all really done for me,\u201d he says. But it was just a matter of time, he figured, until a hitter would lash out. It happened on a sunny Sunday afternoon, when the Cubs were mesmerized by the shtick.\n\u201cI just had nothing,\u201d says Hrabosky, who entered the eighth inning of a tie game. \u201cBut I threw like three line-drive outs.\u201d When he returned for the ninth, the first man up was Madlock, the rookie who had quickly established himself as a dangerous hitter. \u201cI went behind the mound and tried to get whatever energy I could,\u201d Hrabosky says. \u201cWhen I got to the mound, he stepped out and went to the on-deck circle. I\u2019d been waiting. I knew somebody was going to do this. It didn\u2019t bother me. He gets back in the batter\u2019s box, and you see him and he\u2019s like, \u2018Ha ha, I made you wait.\u2019 So I got behind the mound again and he went back to the on-deck circle.\u201d\nThe umpire was not amused. Crawford had already heard an earful from the Cardinals that day about a disputed play earlier in the game. Now he was being ignored.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cBill, get back here,\u201d Crawford called out to Madlock, who did not respond. Thinking that the crowd noise might have drowned out his voice, Crawford repeated his demand, this time with the manager Marshall in his face to argue. The reaction was the same. The outcome was predictable. \u201cHe was another one of those alpha males,\u201d Hernandez says of Crawford. \u201cHe controlled the field \u2014 and he had a temper.\u201d\nThe video picks up shortly after Crawford showed that temper, turning his back on Marshall, another grizzled baseball man who had been schooled to never cede an inch. Moments later there was bedlam.\n\u201cMadlock said something to Simmons,\u201d Kaegel says. \u201cAnd then boom.\u201d\nBodies streamed onto the Astroturf. The veteran Monday, who scrambled onto the field as a peacemaker, recalls the scene as \u201ca three-ring circus \u2014 on-deck circle, home plate and in front of the pitcher\u2019s mound where the wrestling arena took place.\u201d Kaegel wrote about how the players \u201cwent down in an arm-flailing, churning pile.\u201d At the bottom was Simmons, who recalled falling to the ground, unable to breathe, because he\u2019d just absorbed the hardest body block of his life.\nHrabosky charged toward the plate before thinking better of it. When he retreated to the mound, back to the fringes of the fight, he felt someone take hold of him. Right then, Hrabosky heard Monday\u2019s deep voice. \u201cYou\u2019re having too good of a year,\u201d he was told. \u201cDon\u2019t do something stupid.\u201d\nSomehow, no player on either side suffered a serious injury. Only one man was tossed as a direct result of the donnybrook, and it happened after a terse exchange.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you care about the players?\u201d the manager protested.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t care about the players \u2014 they don\u2019t care about me!\u201d the umpire replied.\nWith that, Marshall launched into a flurry of expletives, earning an ejection from Crawford. \u201cMarshall didn\u2019t like my statement,\u201d the umpire told the Chicago Tribune after the game. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think players should be thrown out for fighting.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nDizzy Dean\u2019s widow, Pat, was in attendance for the retirement of her husband\u2019s No. 17. There was perhaps no better authority to judge the merits of a dustup. She offered the ultimate endorsement. \u201cThey must have done this for Diz,\u201d she told the Post-Dispatch. \u201cIt looked like the old Gashouse Gang.\u201d\nThe margins of the scorebook are filled with notes scribbled in pencil. They are legible only to the beat writer who wrote them. Kaegel laughs as he inspects the page, an artifact from what he calls \u201cone of the weirdest things I\u2019ve ever seen in baseball.\u201d Given that his career spanned six decades and thousands of games, this is saying something. The scorebook and his memories were all that Kaegel had kept of the five angry men and the Mad Hungarian. But sometime before his retirement in 2014, research for a story led him to YouTube and the fight. \u201cI was surprised to find it,\u201d Kaegel says. \u201cWho knew that video of it had survived?\u201d\nIn the eight years since it was first unearthed, the footage has become irresistible fodder for those on a perpetual hunt for content. Grimm\u2019s original blog post has been aggregated by others with larger audiences. Almost every version of the video appears to have been ripped from the original on Media Burn, its watermark cropped out. \u201cOnce it gets in that viral machine,\u201d says Jimmy O\u2019Brien, the creator better known as Jomboy, \u201ceveryone just eats up and spits it out.\u201d\nWith every rehearsal it reaches another fan for the first time. O\u2019Brien hadn\u2019t seen it until last year, while digging for content in the early days of the pandemic. \u201cI needed to search for the story,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause none of it makes sense out of context.\u201d Themanson, the psychology professor, grew up religiously watching the \u201cGame of the Week\u201d and \u201cThis Week in Baseball.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019d never seen it before either,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I grew up a Cubs fan.\u201d Will Ohman pitched in the major leagues, and since seeing the video for the first time only recently, he uses an image of the five angry men in his Twitter header. \u201cThat picture in a baseball sense is the embodiment of communication levels on Twitter,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s people shouting at each other with absolutely no idea of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nThe conditions for such ballfield mayhem no longer exist. Umpires can no longer function as blatant authoritarians, and one cross look from \u00c1ngel Hern\u00e1ndez might be enough to break the internet. Players can no longer brawl without fear of major punishment from the league, ensuring that there will generally be more posturing than punching. In this way, the video serves as a pop of nostalgia, a window into a time of nicknames as colorful as the characters themselves. It\u2019s a world that exists no more. Ohman says that the old norms may have been \u201csophomoric\u201d or \u201cbanal,\u201d but for many, they are also missed. \u201cIt was OK to not like each other,\u201d he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to be friends, we didn\u2019t have to get along. People could go fight \u2026 and then they got to leave at the end and say that was settled, we\u2019re moving on. That\u2019s something that has been lost.\u201d\nThe fight has yet to make baseball\u2019s all-time highlight reel. Perhaps it never will. Gone are the days of \u201cThis Week in Baseball,\u201d a show once influential enough to make images iconic. Highlights flood the landscape. It\u2019s hard to rise above the noise. Social media has vast reach but the audience is splintered. Rights issues complicate getting the footage on television. Then there\u2019s the matter of its perceived importance. After all the drama, the Cardinals won the game when Hrabosky retired the side in order, and Simmons walked it off in the ninth. But the victory lost its relevance when the Cardinals were passed by the Pirates in the homestretch of the pennant race. Second place isn\u2019t fertile ground for memories. And the Cubs were, well, they were the Cubs.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t beat them playing,\u201d Madlock told an interviewer once, \u201cso I think we might have won the fight.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nBut so long as it is rehearsed in some form, so long as it keeps rattling around the internet, the fight has a chance to grow in stature. \u201cThis sort of stuff happens quite a bit \u2014 not just in sports,\u201d says Safer, invoking a more serious example, the Tank Man footage from the 1989 student protests in Tiananmen Square. \u201cThe Chinese government has pretty much purged that video or those pictures so most of their citizens have never seen it. And yet every once in a while it sneaks back, where people are astounded that this even happened in China.\u201d\nCertain occasions prompt a resharing. Before a meeting of the Cubs and Cardinals in 2017, MLB dipped into its archives to upload the Joe Garagiola-narrated NBC clip, which hadn\u2019t been shown since the 1974 World Series. \u201cThis is great footage,\u201d Grimm says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got hands and faces making contact with each other in the middle of a baseball field \u2014 with a Hall of Famer tied to the middle of it.\u201d That latter distinction has imbued the incident with another layer of prominence. On the day of Simmons\u2019 induction, Jomboy Media marked the moment by tweeting out the fight. It was accompanied by a fitting caption: \u201cThis is absolute chaos.\u201d\nThe video generated nearly 300,000 views.\nIn September, a few hours before the fight made another revolution around the internet, Simmons stood behind a podium in Cooperstown. He had been nicknamed \u201cSimba,\u201d a nod to the mane of hair that he once wore shoulder-length. He was known to be fiery on the field and thoughtful off it, the kind of player reporters sought out for quotes. He demonstrated that eloquence in his induction speech. \u201cOur game is about wins and losses,\u201d Simmons told the crowd. \u201cBut after 50 years of organized baseball, I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s so much more. Baseball is about all the names and faces that remain firmly planted in one\u2019s memory.\u201d\nWhat remains firmly planted \u2014 and what drifts away \u2014 is a source of fascination even for those immersed in the intricacies of memory. \u201cIt surprises me how much crap you have in there,\u201d says Safer, who proves the point by reciting the starting lineup of the 1953 Milwaukee Braves, his favorite team as a boy. \u201cI have absolutely no use for any of that information, but I can remember the team.\u201d\nDespite finding himself in the middle of it all, Keith Hernandez has virtually no recollection of one of the strangest fights in baseball history. But he never forgot the names or faces. He remembers how Marshall was \u201calways scowling\u201d and how the manager refused to fraternize with opponents because he was so old school. He remembers how Crawford was a \u201ccrusty old Popeye-like cartoon character, like an Irish hard-ass sailor,\u201d and indeed, the umpire served in the Navy aboard the USS Walke, a destroyer that was set ablaze when it was struck by a kamikaze in World War II. He remembers the night that Kingman motherfucked Hrabosky around the bases, and how the pitcher resisted the urge to yell back \u2014 \u201cAl just stood there and looked at him,\u201d he says \u2014 proof that there were brains behind all that bravado.\nMemory isn\u2019t fixed like a photograph. It is an act of reconstruction, which means it\u2019s subject to alteration. \u201cEvery time you remember something it\u2019s kind of like re-opening a saved file, if you think of it like a computer model,\u201d Themanson says. \u201cSo every time you reopen it, it can be re-saved maybe a little bit differently.\u201d Just as they had on the field during the brawl, Monday and Hrabosky have crossed paths as broadcasters over the years. They have joked about the fight though they don\u2019t remember it the same way.\nAdvertisement\nSays Monday: \u201cIt was a lot more fun watching it.\u201d\nSays Hrabosky: \u201cI think it was a lot more fun in person.\u201d\nIf constructing memory is like assembling a puzzle, then context can reshape the pieces. Perhaps this explains how Hrabosky went from rarely mentioning the fight when the video was lost, to recalling it with glee after it resurfaced.\n\u201cI can honestly say that I was the first pitcher to ever throw one pitch with no batter in the batter\u2019s box and the second one with two batters and a manager in the batter\u2019s box,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I have a fond recollection of it.\u201d\nThe Mad Hungarian still wears the mustache of his playing days, though it is graying now. In his home office, he displays three stills of the drama leading up to the brawl. The five angry men have since become a part of his legacy. He isn\u2019t too shy to say that he wants it to endure, and in his retellings, he\u2019s been known to help the process along. \u201cThere was a good 20-minute brawl,\u201d he says, though it was closer to two. \u201cSimmons won it with a homer,\u201d he says, though it was a bouncer up the middle. \u201cMarshall was frozen with his toupee up in the air,\u201d he says, an assertion backed by Madlock, though the video is inconclusive. Finally, when asked how he knew that Marshall wore a toupee, Hrabosky concedes, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not sure if he did or not.\u201d\nWhat is certain, however, is more important than a phantom toupee. Hrabosky believes that the memory is worth rehearsing.\nAnd, more and more, he is not alone.\n(Illustration: John Bradford / The Athletic / WGN-TV)"
