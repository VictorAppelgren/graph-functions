  "content": "President Donald Trump is planning to announce the relocation of U.S. Space Command headquarters from Colorado to Alabama, according to media reports, the latest move in a years-long tussle over the military's space program.\n\nThe planned Sept. 2 announcement would reverse a move by President Joe Biden to overturn Trump's 2021 decision to move Space Command to Alabama. Biden opted to keep the military's newest combatant command in Colorado, which has been the temporary headquarters since the military space program was established in 2019.\n\nAlabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville and other state leaders had pushed to make Alabama the permenant home of Space Command, battling with the Biden administration.\n\nA report released by the Government Accountability Office in June 2022 found the Alabama site - Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville - the \"preferred location\" over five locations. But Biden opted in 2023 to keep Space Command in Colorado, which proponents said was best for military readiness.\n\n\"The deciding factor for President Biden in deciding to keep Space Command in Colorado Springs was operational readiness, pure and simple,\" John Kirby, the National Security Council's former coordinator for strategic communications, said at the time.\n\nTuberville and others continued to push for the relocation, though. The senator is a close Trump ally and Alabama is a state Trump carried by 30 percent points. He lost Colorado by 11 points.\n\nTrump has often linked federal funding decisions and politics. The president previously blocked a move to put the FBI's headquarters in Maryland, calling it a \"liberal state\" and suggested linking disaster aid in California to the state's policy decisions.\n\nAbout 1,700 personnel work at Space Command, according to congressional records.\n\nHuntsville, home to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and a major hub for defense contractors, such as L3Harris and Lockheed Martin, has long lobbied for the Space Command headquarters.",

      "text": "Trump will announce Space Command is moving from Colorado to Alabama\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s administration will announce on Tuesday that U.S. Space Command will be located in Alabama, reversing a Biden-era decision to keep it at its temporary headquarters in Colorado, according to two people familiar with the announcement.\nTrump is expected to speak Tuesday afternoon, and he will give the new location, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to confirm the plans ahead of the official announcement. A Pentagon website set up to livestream the remarks describes the event as a \u201cU.S. Space Command HQ Announcement.\u201d\n\u201cThe president will be making an exciting announcement related to the Department of Defense,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\nSpace Command\u2019s functions include conducting operations like enabling satellite-based navigation and troop communication and providing warning of missile launches.\nAlabama and Colorado have long battled to claim Space Command because it has significant implications for the local economy. The site also has been a political prize, with elected officials from both Alabama and Colorado asserting their state is the better location.\nHuntsville, Alabama, nicknamed Rocket City, has long been home to the Army\u2019s Redstone Arsenal and NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center. The Army\u2019s Space and Missile Defense Command is also located in Huntsville, which drew its nickname because of its role in building the first rockets for the U.S. space program.\nThe announcement caps a four-year back-and-forth on the location of Space Command.\nThe Air Force in 2021 identified Army Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville as the preferred location for the new U.S. Space Command. The city was picked after site visits to six states that compared factors such as infrastructure capacity, community support and costs to the Defense Department.\nThen-President Joe Biden in 2023 announced Space Command would be permanently located in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which had been serving as its temporary headquarters. Biden\u2019s Democratic administration said that keeping the command in Colorado Springs would avoid a disruption in readiness.\nA review by the Defense Department inspector general was inconclusive and could not determine why Colorado was chosen over Alabama. Trump, a Republican who enjoys deep support in Alabama, had long been expected to move Space Command back to Alabama."

      "text": "Biden-Tuberville feud revs up with decision to put space command headquarters in Colorado Springs\nWASHINGTON \u2212 President Joe Biden's decision to make Colorado the permanent home for the U.S. Space Command headquarters intensified an already heated feud with U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., who accused the White House of \"injecting politics into the military.\"\nBiden's decision, announced Monday, overturned a last-minute move by the Trump administration to relocate the center to Alabama, Tuberville's home state.\nThe reversal comes amid a bitter standoff between Biden and Tuberville, who the White House has accused of endangering national security by blocking the promotions of senior military jobs to protest a Pentagon abortion policy.\nTuberville slammed Biden for setting a \"dangerous precedent that military bases are to be used as rewards for political support rather than for national security.\" He added, \"This is absolutely not over,\" vowing in a statement Tuesday to continue to work to bring the Space Command headquarters to his state.\nThe White House rejected Tuberville's assertions.\n\"The deciding factor for President Biden in deciding to keep Space Command in Colorado Springs was operational readiness, pure and simple,\" said John Kirby, the National Security Council's coordinator for strategic communications. \"Had nothing to do with Senator Tuberville's holds, had nothing to do with partisan politics.\"\nBiden was swayed by the head of Space Command, Gen. James Dickinson, who argued that moving his headquarters now would jeopardize military readiness, the Associated Press reported. But Air Force leadership, with studied the issue at length determined that relocating to Huntsville, Alabama was the right move.\nA report released by the Government Accountability Office in June 2022 found the Alabama site the \"preferred location\" over five locations including Colorado Springs, Colorado, which has served as Space Command's temporary home since the command was formally created in August 2019.\nThe review was prompted by former President Donald Trump's announcement in his final days of presidency in 2021 to back Huntsville, Alabama for the headquarters after Air Force and Space Force leaders initially recommended it stay in Colorado.\nPentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said keeping the Space Command headquarters in Colorado ensures \"peak readiness\" during a critical period in the space domain. \"It will also enable the command to most effectively plan, execute and integrate military spacepower into multi-domain global operations in order to deter aggression and defend national interests,\" Ryder said.\nOther Alabama Republican members of Congress echoed Tuberville in blasting the choice.\n\"It's clear that far-left politics, not national security, was the driving force behind the decision,\" said Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. He said Biden's decision warrants a congressional investigation. \"This fight is far from over.\"\nProponents of keeping the command in Colorado argued that moving to Huntsville and creating a new headquarters would set back its progress at a time it needs to move quickly to be positioned to match China\u2019s military space rise. And Colorado Springs is also home to the Air Force Academy, which now graduates Space Force guardians, and more than 24 military space missions, including three Space Force bases.\nColorado's two Democratic senators cheered the decision.\nSen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said the move \"restores integrity to the Pentagon\u2019s basing process and sends a strong message that national security and the readiness of our Armed Forces drive our military decisions. Colorado is the rightful home for U.S. Space Command, and our state will continue to lead America in space for years to come.\"\nAnd breaking with their Alabama colleagues, Colorado's Republican members of Congress also praised the selection of their state.\nRep. Ken Buck, R.-Colo, said, \u201cI applaud the decision today by the Biden administration to keep U.S. Space Command where it belongs \u2014 in Colorado,\u201d Even Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., one of Biden's most outspoken critics, commended the choice, calling Colorado Springs Space Command's \"rightful home.\"\nContributing: Associated Press and USA TODAY White House correspondent Francesca Chambers\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrrison"

      "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Space Command headquarters appears poised to be moving to Huntsville after Alabama Sens. Tommy Tuberville and Katie Britt talked with President Donald Trump about relocating it from Colorado this week.\nTuberville expressed confidence Thursday that North Alabama will soon be home to SPACECOM, which could bring to a close the years-long saga over where the permanent headquarters should be located.\n\u201cI know we\u2019re all excited about getting Space Command to Redstone Arsenal once and for all,\u201d Tuberville told reporters. \u201cThis week, I\u2019ve spent several hours on the phone and several hours in the Oval Office with President Trump and Secretary Hegseth talking about the future of Space Command, not if, but when it happens, and that will be soon.\u201d\nHouse Armed Services Chairman, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Saks, has pushed for Space Command to be located at Redstone Arsenal from the start.\n\u201cThroughout my regular calls with (the Secretary of Defense) and the White House, everyone has agreed: President Trump\u2019s choice, Huntsville, won fair and square,\u201d Rogers said in a statement to Alabama Daily News.\nBritt also talked with Trump about SPACECOM this week and similarly expects a decision to move it to Redstone Arsenal to be forthcoming. Also on Thursday, the U.S. Senate confirmed Matthew Lohmeier to be the Under Secretary of the Air Force. Troy Meink was confirmed to lead the U.S. Air Force in May, which Britt and Tuberville repeatedly said was a key step to getting an announcement on Space Command.\n\u201cThe State of Alabama, the city of Huntsville and Madison County have all done their detailed coordination,\u201d Tuberville said Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to seal the deal once and for all.\u201d\nThe command directs military space operations, from communications and intelligence gathering to missile defense and radar.\nThe Air Force named Redstone Arsenal the preferred location for the headquarters in 2021. But President Joe Biden announced in 2023 that the headquarters would remain in Colorado Springs, which was serving as the temporary home for the command, citing the need for military readiness.\nTwo reports were released earlier this year detailing the back-and-forth debate between defense officials about where Space Command headquarters should be located. The Department of Defense Inspector General report revealed concerns over military readiness and losing workers due to a relocation were linked to the decision to keep the headquarters in Colorado instead of moving it to Huntsville.\nA Government Accountability Office report released at the end of May found the headquarters in Colorado faced ongoing challenges with facilities and staff that impeded the establishment of a full headquarters there.\nU.S. Rep. Dale Strong, R-Huntsville, is also optimistic. He said he\u2019s ready for a final decision after those reports showed Huntsville remained the best location. Strong said he\u2019s had multiple conversations with Trump about SPACECOM. He pointed to a moment he had with the president in June at the Congressional Picnic, captured on video, which showed Trump saying, \u201cBecause I\u2019m moving it to Alabama.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s do what\u2019s right for national security,\u201d Strong told Alabama Daily News Monday. \u201cLet\u2019s award it to Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama and I trust that the president agrees with that. And I feel more than comfortable that this will be coming in the short term.\u201d\n\u201cWe know the best place for U.S. Space Command is behind the fence at Redstone Arsenal and Huntsville,\u201d Tuberville said. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t changed in four years through countless investigations, reports, and it certainly hasn\u2019t changed in the last 48 hours.\u201d\nThis story has been updated."

The bill provides 12 weeks of paid leave for 2.1 million civilian federal workers after the birth of a child, adoption, or start of foster care.\nIvanka Trump, the president's daughter, lobbied on behalf of the parental and family leave legislation.\nStandard defense funding in the bill will keep the U.S. military the strongest in the world, Trump told troops, and \"there's no country that comes even close.\"\nAs he often does, Trump promoted the new Space Force, now the sixth branch of the U.S. military and the first created in seven decades.\n\"It's a big moment,\" he said, and will enable the U.S. government to control \"the ultimate high ground.\"\nDuring a political rally Wednesday in Battle Creek, Mich., Trump told supporters that \"I will be able to tell my kids someday, and everybody else, 'See that Space Force? That was my baby.'\"\nOn Dec. 11, as the bill made its way through Congress, Trump said \"all of our priorities have made it\" into the defense bill. \"Pay Raise for our Troops, Rebuilding our Military, Paid Parental Leave, Border Security, and Space Force!\" Trump tweeted, pledging to sign it immediately.\nThe bill includes a 3.1% pay raise for Pentagon personnel, the largest in more than a decade.\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s armed forces are more powerful than ever,\" Trump said, \"and growing even stronger.\""
