  "description": "Russia has accused Ukraine of drone strikes that sparked a fire at a nuclear power plant in the Kursk region Sunday as Kyiv marked its national Independence Day.",
  "content": "The Independence Monument is pictured as Ukrainian flags fly in Kyiv on Saturday.\n\nRussia accused Ukraine on Sunday of launching drone attacks that sparked a fire at a nuclear power plant in its western Kursk region overnight, as Ukraine celebrated 34 years since declaring its independence from the Soviet Union.\n\nRussian officials said several power and energy facilities were targeted in the overnight strikes. The fire at the nuclear facility was quickly extinguished with no injuries reported, according to the plant\u2019s press service on Telegram. While the attack damaged a transformer, radiation levels remained within normal ranges.\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog said it was aware of media reports that a transformer at the plants had caught fire \u201cdue to military activity,\u201d but hadn\u2019t received independent confirmation. The International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s director-general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said that \u201cevery nuclear facility must be protected at all times.\u201d\n\nUkraine did not immediately comment on the alleged attack.\n\nFirefighters also responded to a blaze at the port of Ust-Luga in Russia\u2019s Leningrad region, home to a major fuel export terminal. The regional governor said approximately 10 Ukrainian drones were shot down, with debris igniting the fire.\n\nRussia\u2019s Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses intercepted 95 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory overnight into Sunday.\n\nRussia fired 72 drones and decoys, along with a cruise missile, into Ukraine overnight, Ukraine\u2019s air force said. Of these, 48 drones were shot down or jammed.\n\nThe incidents occurred as Ukraine marked Independence Day, commemorating its 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered remarks in a video address from Kyiv\u2019s Independence Square, emphasizing the nation\u2019s resolve.\n\n\u201cWe are building a Ukraine that will have enough strength and power to live in security and peace,\u201d Zelensky said, calling for a \u201cjust peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat our future will be is up to us alone,\u201d he said, in a nod to the U.S.\u2013Russia summit in Alaska this month, which many feared would leave Ukrainian and European interests sidelined.\n\n\u201cAnd the world knows this. And the world respects this. It respects Ukraine. It perceives Ukraine as an equal,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. special envoy Keith Kellogg was in attendance at Independence Day celebrations in Kyiv, during which Zelensky awarded him the Ukrainian Order of Merit, of the 1st degree.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney arrived in Kyiv on Sunday morning for meetings with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cOn this special day \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s Independence Day \u2014 it is especially important for us to feel the support of our friends. And Canada has always stood by our side,\u201d wrote Andriy Yermak, Zelensky\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nIn a joint news conference with Zelensky, Carney said Canada will invest 2 billion Canadian dollars \u2014 about $1.5 billion in U.S. dollars \u2014 in new military assistance for Ukraine to boost its army and provide urgently needed weapons.\n\nZelensky said the two leaders were considering the presence of Canadian forces on the ground in Ukraine as part of a reassurance force.\n\nNorway announced significant new military aid Sunday, pledging about $695 million for air defense systems. Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said Norway and Germany are jointly funding two Patriot systems, including missiles, with Norway also helping procure air defense radar.\n\nPope Leo XIV prayed Sunday for peace in Ukraine as he marked the country\u2019s Independence Day with a special appeal during his weekly noon blessing. He said the faithful were joining Ukrainians in \u201casking that the Lord give peace to their martyred country.\u201d\n\nLeo also sent a telegram to Zelensky to mark the holiday, which the Ukrainian leader posted on X along with similar notes from other world leaders.\n\nIn the letter, Leo assured his prayers for all Ukrainians who are suffering, and wrote: \u201cI implore the Lord to move the hearts of people of good will, that the clamor of arms may fall silent and give way to dialogue, opening the path to peace for the good of all.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, fighting continued on the front line in eastern Ukraine, where Russia claimed Saturday that its forces had seized two villages in the Donetsk region.\n\nRussia\u2019s Defense Ministry said Sunday that 146 Russian servicemen had been returned from Ukraine, in exchange for the same number of Ukrainian servicemen. The ministry said the latest exchange also included eight residents of Russia\u2019s Kursk region, which was subject to a surprise Ukrainian incursion in August 2024, who were returned to Russia after being held in Ukraine.\n\nShortly after the Russian announcement, Zelensky said, \u201cour people are coming home.\u201d He said that those being exchanged included members of the Ukrainian armed forces, the National Guard, the State Border Guard Service and civilians. \u201cMost of them had been in captivity since 2022,\u201d he said.\n\nZelensky did not confirm the number of prisoners involved in the exchange.",

      "text": "European postal services suspend shipment of packages to U.S. over import tariffs\n- Share via\nATHENS \u2014 The end of an exemption on tariff duties for low-value packages coming into the United States is causing multiple international postal services to pause shipping to the U.S. as they await more clarity on the rule.\nThe exemption, known as the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption, allows packages worth less than $800 to come into the U.S. duty-free. A total of 1.36 billion packages were sent in 2024 under this exemption, for goods worth $64.6 billion, according to data from the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Agency.\nIt is set to expire Friday. On Saturday, postal services around Europe announced that they are suspending the shipment of many packages to the United States amid confusion over new import duties.\nPostal services in Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Italy said they will stop shipping most merchandise to the U.S. effective immediately. France and Austria will follow Monday.\nThe U.K.\u2019s Royal Mail said it would halt shipments to the U.S. on Tuesday to allow time for those packages to arrive before duties kick in. Items originating in the U.K. worth over $100 \u2014 including gifts to friends and family \u2014 will incur a 10% duty, it said.\n\u201cKey questions remain unresolved, particularly regarding how and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be carried out,\u201d DHL, the largest shipping provider in Europe, said in a statement.\nThe company said that starting Saturday it \u201cwill no longer be able to accept and transport parcels and postal items containing goods from business customers destined for the U.S.\u201d\nA trade framework agreed on by the U.S. and the European Union last month set a 15% tariff on the vast majority of products shipped from the EU. Packages under $800 will now also be subject to the tariff.\nThe U.S. duty-free exemption for goods originating from China ended in May as part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to curb American shoppers from ordering low-value Chinese goods. The exemption is being extended to shipments from around the world.\nMany European postal services say they are pausing deliveries now because they cannot guarantee the goods will enter the U.S. before Aug. 29. They cite ambiguity about what kind of goods are covered by the new rules, and the lack of time to process their implications.\nPostnord, the Nordic logistics company, and Italy\u2019s postal service announced similar suspensions effective Saturday.\n\u201cIn the absence of different instructions from US authorities ... Poste Italiane will be forced, like other European postal operators, to temporarily suspend acceptance of all shipments containing goods destined for the United States, starting August 23. Mail shipments not containing merchandise will continue to be accepted,\u201d Poste Italiane said in a statement Friday.\nShipping by services such as DHL Express remains possible, it added.\nBjorn Bergman, head of PostNord\u2019s Group Brand and Communication, said the pause was \u201cunfortunate but necessary to ensure full compliance of the newly implemented rules.\u201d\nIn the Netherlands, PostNL spokesperson Wout Witteveen said the Trump administration is pressing ahead with the new duties despite U.S. authorities lacking a system to collect them. He said that PostNL is working closely with its U.S. counterparts to find a solution.\n\u201cIf you have something to send to America, you should do it today,\u201d Witteveen told the Associated Press.\nAustrian Post, Austria\u2019s leading logistics and postal service provider, stated that the last acceptance of commercial shipments to the U.S., including Puerto Rico, will take place Tuesday.\nFrance\u2019s national postal service, La Poste, said the U.S. did not provide full details or allow enough time for the French postal service to prepare for new customs procedures.\n\u2033Despite discussions with U.S. customs services, no time was provided to postal operators to re-organize and assure the necessary computer updates to conform to the new rules,\u2033 it said in a statement.\nPostEurop, an association of 51 European public postal operators, said that if no solution can be found by Aug. 29, all its members will probably follow suit.\nNellas and Anderson write for the Associated Press and reported from Athens and New York, respectively.

      "text": "A commuter college thought it could avoid Trump\u2019s education crackdown. It was wrong\n- Share via\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. \u2014 Administrators at the state university\u2019s campus in Colorado Springs thought they stood a solid chance of dodging the Trump administration\u2019s offensive on higher education.\nLocated on a picturesque bluff with a stunning view of Pikes Peak, the school is far removed from the Ivy League colleges that have drawn President Trump\u2019s ire. Most of its students are commuters, getting degrees while holding down full-time jobs. Students and faculty alike describe the university, which is in a conservative part of the blue state of Colorado, as politically subdued, if not apolitical.\nThat optimism was misplaced.\nAn Associated Press review of thousands of pages of emails from school officials, as well as interviews with students and professors, reveals that school leaders, teachers and students soon found themselves in the Republican administration\u2019s crosshairs, forcing them to navigate what they described as an unprecedented and haphazard degree of change.\nWhether Washington has downsized government departments, rescinded funding or launched investigations into diversity programs or campus antisemitism, the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs has confronted many of the same challenges as elite universities across the nation.\nThe school lost three major federal grants and found itself under investigation by the Trump Education Department. In the hopes of avoiding that scrutiny, the university renamed websites and job titles, all while dealing with pressure from students, faculty and staff who wanted the school to take a more combative stance.\n\u201cUncertainty is compounding,\u201d the school\u2019s chancellor told faculty at a February meeting, according to minutes of the session. \u201cAnd the speed of which orders are coming has been a bit of a shock.\u201d\nThe college declined to make any administrators available to be interviewed. A spokesman asked the AP to make clear that any professors or students interviewed for this story were speaking for themselves and not the institution. Several faculty members also asked for anonymity, either because they did not have tenure or they did not want to call unnecessary attention to themselves and their scholarship in the current political environment.\n\u201cLike our colleagues across higher education, we\u2019ve spent considerable time working to understand the new directives from the federal government,\u201d the chancellor, Jennifer Sobanet, said in a statement provided to the AP.\nStudents said they have been able to sense the stress being felt by school administrators and professors.\n\u201cWe have administrators that are feeling pressure, because we want to maintain our funding here. It\u2019s been tense,\u201d said Ava Knox, a rising junior who covers the university administration for the school newspaper.\nFaculty, she added, \u201cwant to be very careful about how they\u2019re conducting their research and about how they\u2019re addressing the student population. They are also beholden to this new set of kind of ever-changing guidelines and stipulations by the federal government.\u201d\nA White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\nMisplaced optimism\nShortly after Trump won a second term in November, University of Colorado-Colorado Springs leaders were trying to gather information on the incoming president\u2019s plans. In December, Sobanet met the newly elected Republican congressman who represented the school\u2019s district, a conservative area that Trump won with 53% of the vote. In her meeting notes obtained by the AP, the chancellor sketched out a scenario in which the college might avoid the drastic cuts and havoc under the incoming administration.\n\u201cResearch dollars \u2014 hard to pull back grant dollars but Trump tried to pull back some last time. The money goes through Congress,\u201d Sobanet wrote in notes prepared for the meeting. \u201cGrant money will likely stay but just change how they are worded and what it will fund.\u201d\nSobanet also observed that dismantling the federal Education Department would require congressional authorization. That was unlikely, she suggested, given the U.S. Senate\u2019s composition.\nLike many others, she did not fully anticipate how aggressively Trump would seek to transform the federal government.\nConservatives\u2019 desire to revamp higher education began well before Trump took office.\nThey have long complained that universities have become bastions of liberal indoctrination and raucous protests. In 2023, Republicans in Congress had a contentious hearing with several Ivy League university leaders. Shortly after, the presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania resigned. During the presidential campaign last fall, Trump criticized campus protests against the war in Gaza, as well as what he said was a liberal bias in classrooms.\nHis new administration opened investigations into alleged antisemitism at several universities. It froze more than $400 million in research grants and contracts at Columbia, along with more than $2.6 billion at Harvard. Columbia reached an agreement last month to pay $220 million to resolve the investigation.\nWhen Harvard filed a lawsuit challenging Trump\u2019s actions, his administration tried to block the school from enrolling international students. The Trump administration has also threatened to revoke Harvard\u2019s tax-exempt status.\nNorthwestern University, Penn, Princeton and Cornell have seen big chunks of funding cut over how they dealt with the protests about Israel\u2019s war in Gaza or over the schools\u2019 support for transgender athletes.\nTrump\u2019s decision to target the wealthiest, most prestigious institutions provided some comfort to administrators at the approximately 4,000 other colleges and universities in the country.\nMost higher education students in the United States are educated at regional public universities or community colleges. Such schools have not typically drawn attention from culture warriors.\nStudents and professors at UCCS hoped Trump\u2019s crackdown would bypass the school and others like it.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got everyone \u2014 liberals, conservatives, middle of the road\u201d at the college, said Jeffrey Scholes, a professor in the philosophy department. \u201cYou just don\u2019t see the kind of unrest and polarization that you see at other campuses.\u201d\nThe purse strings\nThe federal government has lots of leverage over higher education. It provides about $60 billion a year to universities for research. In addition, a majority of students in the U.S. need grants and loans from various federal programs to help pay tuition and living expenses.\nThis budget year, UCCS got about $19 million in research funding from a combination of federal, state and private sources. Though that is a relatively small portion of the school\u2019s overall $369-million budget, the college has made a push in recent years to bolster its campus research program by taking advantage of grant money from government agencies such as the U.S. Defense Department and National Institutes of Health. The widespread federal grant cut could derail those efforts.\nSchool officials were dismayed when the Trump administration terminated research grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Defense Department and the National Science Foundation, emails show. The grants funded programs in civics, cultural preservation and boosting women in technology fields.\nSchool administrators scrambled to contact federal officials to learn whether other grants were on the chopping block, but they struggled to find answers, the records show.\nSchool officials repeatedly sought out the assistance of federal officials only to learn those officials were not sure what was happening as the Trump administration halted grant payments, fired thousands of employees and closed agencies.\n\u201cThe sky is falling\u201d at NIH, a university official reported in notes on a call in which the school\u2019s lobbyists were providing reports of what was happening in Washington.\nThere are also concerns about other changes in Washington that will affect how students pay for college, according to interviews with faculty and education policy experts.\nWhile only Congress can fully abolish the Department of Education, the Trump administration has tried to dramatically cut back its staff and parcel out many of its functions to other agencies. The administration laid off nearly 1,400 employees, and problems have been reported in the systems that handle student loans. Management of student loans is expected to shift to another agency.\nIn addition, an early version of a major funding bill in Congress included major cuts to tuition grants. Though that provision did not make it into the law, Congress did cap loans for students seeking graduate degrees. That policy could have ripple effects in the coming years on institutions such as UCCS that rely on tuition dollars for their operating expenses.\nDEI and transgender issues\nTo force change on campus, the Trump administration has begun investigations targeting diversity programs and efforts to combat antisemitism.\nThe Education Department, for example, opened an investigation in March targeting a PhD scholarship program that partnered with 45 universities, including the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs, to expand opportunities for women and nonwhites in graduate education. The administration alleged the program was only open to certain nonwhite students and amounted to racial discrimination.\n\u201cSorry to be the bearer of bad news UCCS is included on the list\u201d of schools being investigated, wrote Annie Larson, assistant vice president of federal relations and outreach for the entire University of Colorado system.\n\u201cOh wow, this is surprising,\u201d wrote back Hillary Fouts, dean of the graduate school at UCCS.\nUCCS also struggled with how to handle executive orders, particularly those on transgender issues.\nIn response to an order that aimed to revoke funds to schools that allowed trans women to play women\u2019s sports, UCCS began a review of its athletic programs. It determined it had no transgender athletes, the records show. University officials were also relieved to discover that only one school in their athletic conference was affected by the order, and UCCS rarely if ever had matches or games against that school.\n\u201cWe do not have any students impacted by this and don\u2019t compete against any teams that we are aware of that will be impacted by this,\u201d wrote the vice chancellor for student affairs to colleagues.\nAvoiding the spotlight\nThe attacks led UCCS to take preemptive actions and to self-censor in the hopes of saving programs and avoiding the Trump administration\u2019s spotlight.\nEmails show that the school\u2019s legal counsel began looking at all the university\u2019s websites and evaluating whether any scholarships might need to be reworded. The university changed the web address of its diversity initiatives from www.diversity.uccs.edu to www.belonging.uccs.edu.\nAnd the administrator responsible for the university\u2019s division of Inclusive Culture & Belonging got a new job title in January: director of strategic initiatives. University professors said the school debated whether to rename the Women\u2019s and Ethnic Studies department to avoid drawing attention from Trump, but so far the department has not been renamed.\nAlong the same lines, UCCS administrators have sought to avoid getting dragged into controversies, a frequent occurrence in the first Trump administration. UCCS officials attended a presentation from the education consulting firm EAB, which encouraged schools not to react to every news cycle. That could be a challenge because some students and faculty are calling for vocal resistance on issues from climate change to immigration.\nSoon after Trump was sworn in, for example, a staff member in UCCS\u2019s sustainability program began pushing the University of Colorado system to condemn Trump\u2019s withdrawal from an international agreement to tackle climate change. It was the type of statement universities had issued without thinking twice in past administrations.\nIn an email, UCCS\u2019 top public relations executive warned his boss: \u201cThere is a growing sentiment among the thought leadership in higher ed that campus leaders not take a public stance on major issues unless they impact their campus community.\u201d\nTau writes for the Associated Press. AP education writer Collin Binkley in Washington contributed to this report."

Supporters say that lets people work, visit doctors and travel safely.\nNewsom\u2019s press office responded in a social media post on X that Singh obtained a work permit while Donald Trump was president, which McLaughlin disputed.\nFlorida authorities said Singh entered the U.S. illegally from Mexico in 2018.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis dispatched Lt. Gov. Jay Collins to California to escort Singh onto an airplane Thursday.\nSingh made the illegal turn on the highway about 50 miles north of West Palm Beach, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. A minivan in the neighboring lane was unable to avoid the truck\u2019s trailer and slammed into it, killing the minivan\u2019s driver and two passengers.\nSingh and a passenger in his truck were not injured."
