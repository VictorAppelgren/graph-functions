  "description": "Key PointsHertz is selling used rental vehicles on Amazon Autos in four select cities.",
  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None Hertz is selling used rental vehicles on Amazon Autos in four select cities.\n\u2022 None Hertz benefits by reaching customers who might not consider buying a used fleet vehicle.\n\u2022 None Amazon benefits by scaling up its Amazon Autos offerings.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Amazon \u203a\n\nNo, before you ask, e-commerce titan Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has not bought struggling car rental company Hertz Global (NASDAQ: HTZ), nor has it gotten into the rental car business (at least, not yet). Instead, Amazon is offering used Hertz rental vehicles for sale through its Amazon Autos service.\n\nHere's why this looks like great news for Hertz and Amazon investors alike.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nMost potential car buyers won't be able to run right out and buy a Hertz vehicle on Amazon Autos. This is essentially a pilot program being rolled out in just four cities. But if you're one of the lucky few who live within 75 miles of Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, or Seattle, you'll be able to browse thousands of used Hertz vehicles on the Amazon Autos site, schedule a test drive, e-sign paperwork, and complete the entire purchase online, then pick up the vehicle at a nearby Hertz location.\n\nAlthough the scope of this partnership is limited, it's a big leap forward for Amazon Autos. When the site launched in December, it was limited to selling new Hyundai vehicles (and for most of us, still is). In early August, it began allowing Hyundai dealers in the Los Angeles area to list used and certified pre-owned vehicles on the site. As the site's first fleet dealer, Hertz's online offerings will allow Amazon to list cars from Toyota (NYSE: TM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), among others.\n\nWhy it's good for Hertz\n\nWe don't know exactly how many used vehicles Hertz sells each year, but the company says the number is in the \"hundreds of thousands.\" Assuming that means \"more than 200,000,\" that could mean Hertz's annual sales approach Carvana's (NYSE: CVNA) 416,348. Both fall well short of CarMax's (NYSE: KMX) 1.3 million vehicle sales per year.\n\nSome consumers shy away from buying used rental cars, arguing that drivers are more likely to put unnecessary wear and tear on a car they don't own. Hertz should benefit from having its vehicles listed on a site that isn't exclusively associated with its rental service. It also gains access to the hundreds of millions of customers who already shop on Amazon and trust the service. Given Hertz's spotty profitability record, every opportunity to reach more customers is a benefit.\n\nWhy it's good for Amazon\n\nLike the rest of Amazon, Amazon Autos will operate better at scale.\n\nMerchants offer their goods on Amazon's e-commerce platform (despite the fees Amazon charges) because they know a lot of people look for certain types of products on Amazon first, only shopping elsewhere if they don't find what they're looking for. But if Amazon Autos never has many cars available, or only sells specific brands (like Hyundai), or is limited to new vehicles (which only represent about one-quarter of all U.S. auto sales), it'll never be the first place people look when buying a car.\n\nBy partnering with Hertz (and with Hyundai and potentially with other car dealers), Amazon gets the best of both worlds: It dramatically increases its Amazon Autos offerings and doesn't have to worry about managing, maintaining, or delivering an auto fleet of its own. It just lists the vehicles on its site (which costs next to nothing now that the site infrastructure is built) and takes a cut of any sales it generates.\n\nIf Amazon can continue to rapidly scale up its Amazon Autos service by making more deals, it could turn itself into the next CarMax. And CarMax, remember, pulls in tens of billions of dollars in revenue per year. The Hertz partnership is just the first step to achieving that scale, but I'm betting it won't be the last.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $661,220!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,114,162!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,069% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 185% for the S&P 500. Don\u2019t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n\nJohn Bromels has positions in Amazon, CarMax, and Ford Motor Company.

      "text": "If you're considering an investment in Amazon (AMZN 0.23%) stock, you may be wondering who owns the company. Founder Jeff Bezos launched Amazon from his garage in Bellevue, Washington, in 1994, back when the World Wide Web was in its infancy.

      "text": "Amazon (AMZN 0.23%) is a retail and cloud computing leader. The company rang up $155.7 billion in net sales in the first quarter of 2025, including $29.3 billion from Amazon Web Services (AWS). The technology behemoth is still growing briskly, with sales rising 9% in the period, while AWS' revenue jumped 17%.\nThe e-commerce giant has expanded into several new areas over the years, partly driven by acquiring other companies. Here's a look at some of the notable companies Amazon has purchased and ones it might buy in the future. Understanding the companies Amazon owns is an important aspect of investment research for those interested in learning how to invest money in its stock.\nE-commerce\nWhat it owns\nWhat companies does Amazon own?\nAmazon has a large and increasingly diversified business. It's much more than an e-commerce site. While the company groups its operations into three segments (North America, International, and AWS), there are many moving parts.\nThe company owns a portfolio of e-commerce sites, manufactures several electronic devices (Alexa, Kindle, Fire, Ring, and Blink), and offers a variety of services through its Amazon Prime membership program, including video streaming (Prime Video), music streaming (Prime Music), and health services. It's also a large cloud services provider.\nAmazon has built its business through heavy investment in research and development (R&D) and targeted acquisitions. Here's a look at the 10 largest companies Amazon has acquired throughout its history.\nWhole Foods\nAmazon bought natural and organic grocery store operator Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017. The transaction provided Amazon with a physical retail presence. It's Amazon's biggest acquisition so far. Acquiring Whole Foods enables Amazon to offer grocery services to its customers.\nMetro-Goldwin-Mayer (MGM)\nAmazon bought MGM in 2021 for $8.5 billion. The deal provided the company with a treasure trove of content, including more than 4,000 movies and 17,000 TV shows. The acquisition complements Amazon Studios, which primarily focuses on producing TV shows. It also added content for the company's streaming services (Amazon Prime and Freevee, formally IMDb TV).\nOne Medical\nThe company purchased One Medical for $3.9 billion in cash in 2022. One Medical is a technology-powered primary care organization. Amazon sees the transaction as a way to transform the healthcare industry by leveraging its technology to make healthcare more accessible and affordable.\nZoox\nThe tech titan bought Zoox in 2020 for $1.2 billion. The self-driving vehicle start-up is working to develop a fully autonomous solution for ridesharing.\nZappos\nAmazon bought online apparel and footwear sales platform Zappos.com in 2009. It paid an estimated $1.2 billion. The company continues to operate the website as part of its global e-commerce platform.\nRing\nAmazon bought Ring, a video doorbell maker, for $1 billion in 2018. The transaction enabled Ring to accelerate its mission of reducing crime with its affordable home security products. Amazon has expanded Ring to include a subscription services component powered by AWS.\nPillPack\nThe company purchased PillPack for $1 billion in 2018. PillPack is an online pharmacy. The acquisition is part of Amazon's move to help improve the healthcare sector.\nTwitch\nThe technology company bought Twitch for $970 million in 2014. Twitch is the leading live video streaming platform for gamers. The deal broadened Amazon's reach into the gaming market.\nKiva Systems\nAmazon bought robotics company Kiva Systems for $775 million in 2012. The company builds robots for warehouses. Now Amazon Robotics, Kiva has helped Amazon automate its distribution network.\nSouq.com\nAmazon bought Souq.com in 2017 for $580 million. Souq.com is an e-commerce leader in the Middle East, which was a new region for Amazon at the time of the deal. The acquisition has helped drive Amazon's international expansion.\nIn addition to these larger purchases, Amazon has also acquired a few other notable companies, including:\n- Audible: It bought the spoken audio information and entertainment company for $300 million in 2008.\n- Blink: Amazon bought video monitor company Blink for about $90 million in 2017.\n- Goodreads: In 2013, the company paid $150 million for Goodreads, which helps users track the books they've read.\n- IMDb: It bought the online database for the entertainment industry for $55 million in 1998. It has rebranded IMDb's streaming service as Amazon Freevee.\nAmazon has also made a few notable investments in companies that it doesn't own, including:\n- Rivian (RIVN 0.04%): Amazon owns 16.6% of the electric vehicle maker's shares. Rivian has a deal to supply Amazon with 100,000 electric delivery vans by 2030.\n- Anthropic: Amazon signed a strategic collaboration agreement with Anthropic to advance generative artificial intelligence (AI) in 2023. At the time, it agreed to invest as much as $4 billion into the company for a minority stake. Amazon deepened its collaboration with Anthropic in late 2024, agreeing to invest another $4 billion into the AI company.\n- Diamond Sports: It invested $115 million into the operator of regional sports channels, giving it a minority stake. The deal helped save Diamond, which was in bankruptcy and facing closure. The investment will allow Prime Video viewers to access some live sports content.\nFuture companies\nWhat companies could Amazon buy in the future?\nAmazon has acquired more than 100 companies over the years. Many of its deals are smaller purchases of talent or technology. However, the company will make a larger acquisition when it finds the right product or platform fit.\nIt certainly has the financial flexibility to continue making big acquisitions as opportunities arise. The company had $101 billion of cash, equivalents, and marketable securities on its balance sheet at the end of the first quarter of 2025 against $52.6 billion of long-term debt. Meanwhile, its business is starting to generate massive free cash flow.\nAmazon produced $25.9 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months (as of the first quarter of 2025). Given its enormous size (roughly $2 trillion market capitalization in mid-2025), cash position, and growing free cash flow, Amazon could acquire almost any company it wanted.\nHowever, getting a sizable deal to pass regulatory approval will likely be challenging. The company abandoned its $1.7 billion acquisition of vacuum robot maker iRobot (IRBT -2.01%) after finding \"no path to regulatory approval for the deal.\" Government regulators are getting increasingly concerned about competition in the tech industry, leading them to take a very hard look at acquisitions.\nMergers and Acquisitions\nThat rejection will likely cause Amazon to focus on acquiring start-ups that will fly under the radar of regulators. However, that doesn't mean Amazon won't try to find a deal that's a good strategic fit and can pass regulatory scrutiny.\nOne potential path it could take is to buy more content for its Prime Video streaming service. Potential options include Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD 3.05%).\nParamount is a leading entertainment company with several notable brands, including CBS and Nickelodeon. It also has live sports expertise and a streaming service (Paramount+). Meanwhile, Warner Bros. Discovery has a large portfolio of brands, including CNN, HBO, HGTV, and Discovery. In addition, it has a streaming service, HBO Max.\nAnother option Amazon could consider is getting deeper into the healthcare industry by acquiring a pharmacy chain like CVS Healthcare (CVS 0.55%). There are some interesting potential synergies, like when Amazon bought Whole Foods. Acquiring a pharmacy operator would give it a physical retail footprint to combine with its PillPack and One Medical operations.\nBrick-and-Mortar\nIn addition, CVS Healthcare has expanded deeper into the healthcare industry over the years. It has a pharmacy and consumer wellness segment, health services (including pharmacy benefits management), and a healthcare benefits provider.\nA different path Amazon could take is to buy a cybersecurity company to bolster its AWS capabilities and compete with rivals like Microsoft (MSFT 1.0%). Palo Alto Networks (PANW 1.83%), CrowdStrike (CRWD 1.17%), and Zscaler (ZS 2.1%) are some of the leading cloud security providers.\nBuying one of these companies would enable Amazon to provide even more security to AWS customers, similar to Alphabet's (GOOG 0.18%)(GOOGL 0.21%) Google subsidiary's $32 billion acquisition of Wiz to boost its cloud security offerings. It would also allow the company to tap into a massive and growing market. According to CrowdStrike, the total addressable market opportunity for its AI-native security platform will rise from $116 billion this year to $250 billion by 2029.\nRelated investing topics\nThe bottom line on companies Amazon owns\nAmazon has been an active acquirer over the years, with more than 100 deals under its belt. While most of those have been smaller acquisitions of talent and technology, it has made some notable purchases like Whole Foods and Twitch, which have helped drive growth.\nThe company will likely try to continue making deals in the future, although it's becoming increasingly challenging from a regulatory perspective. However, if Amazon can find the right strategic acquisition that can pass regulatory scrutiny, it could help drive additional growth in the years ahead and make the tech titan an even better stock to buy and hold for the long term.\nFAQ\nCompanies Amazon owns: FAQ\nDoes Amazon own Google?\nAmazon doesn't own Google. Rival technology giant Alphabet owns search giant Google.\nWhat businesses has Amazon bought?\nAmazon has acquired more than 100 businesses throughout the years. Its 10 biggest acquisitions include Whole Foods, MGM, One Medical, Zoox, Zappos, Ring, PillPack, Twitch, Kiva Systems, and Souq.com.\nWhat is Amazon's largest purchase in history?\nWhole Foods is the largest acquisition Amazon has made in its history. It bought the natural and organic grocery store operator for $13.7 billion in 2017.\nWhich company owned Amazon?\nNo single company owns Amazon. It's a publicly traded company owned by its shareholders. Founder Jeff Bezos is the company's largest shareholder. He still owns 8.6% of its outstanding shares.\nMost of its other top shareholders are large asset management firms that own shares on behalf of their mutual fund and exchange-traded fund (ETF) clients. Amazon's three largest institutional investors are The Vanguard Group, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), and State Street (NYSE:STT) at 7.7%, 4.1%, and 3.4%, respectively, as of mid-2025."

      "text": "How Many Cars Are in the U.S.? Car Ownership Statistics for 2025\nKEY POINTS\n- Car ownership increase: In 2023, 91.7% of U.S. households owned a vehicle, up from 90.9% in 2015.\n- Truck dominance: Trucks are the most common vehicle type in the U.S., despite higher insurance costs.\n- State variability: Car ownership rates vary by state, with Idaho at 96% and Washington, D.C. at 64%.\nCar ownership rates are ticking upwards in the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 91.7% of U.S. households had at least one vehicle available in 2023, compared to 90.9% in 2015.\nThe United States consistently ranks near the top in terms of car ownership, and in several states, at least 95% of households have access to a vehicle. There are, however, a few areas with more robust public transportation systems that buck the norm, including Washington, D.C., New York, and New Jersey.\nRead on to find out where your state ranked, the total number of vehicles in the country, and more of the latest car ownership statistics.\nNational car ownership statistics\nThere were a total of 284,614,269 registered vehicles in the United States in 2023, according to the Federal Highway Administration. That's an 8% increase from 2015, when there were 263,610,219 registered vehicles on the road in the U.S.\nIt might surprise you to learn that trucks, and not automobiles, were the most popular type of vehicle. Even though car insurance quotes tend to be higher for trucks, they make up well over half the vehicles in the country.\n| Automobiles Registered | Buses Registered | Trucks Registered | Motorcycles Registered | Total Vehicles Registered |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 96,901,563 | 967,525 | 177,228,271 | 9,516,910 | 284,614,269 |\nMost households (91.7%) had at least one vehicle available in 2023. That's 0.8% more than in 2015. Notably, the percentage of households that have one or two vehicles fell slightly from 2015 to 2023 while the percentage of vehicles with three or more vehicles marginally increased.\n| Number of Vehicles | Percentage of Households (2022) | Percentage of Households (2015) |\n|---|---|---|\n| No vehicles available | 8.3% | 9.1% |\n| 1 vehicle available | 32.9% | 33.7% |\n| 2 vehicles available | 36.8% | 37.4% |\n| 3 or more vehicles available | 14.6% | 13.8% |\n| Any vehicle | 7.4% | 6.0% |\nCar ownership rates by state\nCar ownership rates vary significantly by area. In Idaho, 96% of households have access to at least one vehicle, compared to just 64% in Washington, D.C. and 71% in New York.\nThere's also a huge difference in the average number of vehicles per household. Delaware has an average of 1.1 vehicles per household, while in Montana, there's a whopping 5.2 vehicles per household. Ideally those multi-car households are bundling coverages, so they can get discounts on car insurance.\nVehicle numbers per state generally coincide with population numbers. California, Texas, Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania have the most registered vehicles and are among the most populous states. From 2015 to 2023, the number of registered vehicles in 38 states and Washington, D.C. increased. Vehicle registrations decreased in 12 states over that period.\nElectric vehicle ownership rates by state\nThere were 3,555,445 registered electric vehicles in the United States as of September 2024, which is 1.25% of all registered vehicles.\nCalifornians own 35% of the EVs registered in the U.S., some 1.25 million. In no other state is there more than 260,000 EVs registered.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, North Dakota recorded the lowest total, with just 959 electric vehicles.\nWith more EVs comes more demand for charging, and California has by far the highest number of EV chargers out of any state. North Dakota has the second-fewest, only ahead of Alaska.\nCar ownership rates by city\nMurrieta, California is the city with the highest car ownership rate in the United States, as 99.3% of its households own vehicles. Here's the full top 10:\n| City | Percentage of Households That Own Vehicles |\n|---|---|\n| Murrieta, California | 99.3% |\n| League City, Texas | 99.0% |\n| Surprise, Arizona | 98.7% |\n| West Jordan, Utah | 98.7% |\n| Cary, North Carolina | 98.6% |\n| Pearland, Texas | 98.6% |\n| Highlands Ranch, Colorado | 98.5% |\n| Centennial, Colorado | 98.3% |\n| Gilbert, Arizona | 98.3% |\n| Elk Grove, California | 98.2% |\nNew York City has the lowest car ownership rate by far at 45.6%. Cities with low car ownership tend to have more public transportation options and high population densities. This makes a car more of a luxury than a necessity, especially considering the extra costs involved, such as car insurance and parking.\n| City | Percentage of Households That Own Vehicles |\n|---|---|\n| New York, New York | 45.6% |\n| Newark, New Jersey | 59.7% |\n| Washington, D.C. | 62.7% |\n| Jersey City, New Jersey | 62.9% |\n| Cambridge, Massachusetts | 63.2% |\n| Boston, Massachusetts | 66.2% |\n| Paterson, New Jersey | 67.0% |\n| Hartford, Connecticut | 67.4% |\n| San Francisco, California | 70.1% |\n| Philadelphia, Pennsylvania | 70.5% |\nIn case you're wondering why Washington, D.C.'s car ownership rate is different here than it was earlier, it's because this data is from TitleMax. The numbers earlier were from the Federal Highway Administration. It's normal to have some variations between data sources.\nCar ownership in 2025 and beyond\nAlthough car ownership rates and registered vehicle numbers rose from 2020 to 2023, they did so at a considerably slower rate than from 2018 to 2020. Only 1.2 million new vehicles were registered in 2023, compared to 6.3 million in 2021 and 2.9 million in 2019.\nThat's a reflection of car prices rising quickly in 2021 and 2022 and inflation continuing to squeeze the wallets of Americans throughout 2023. The price of new vehicles grew faster than red-hot inflation for much of 2021 and 2022.\nThe recent slowdown in automobile purchases comes after a tough 2020 for the industry. From 2015 to 2019, dealers had five straight years with at least 17 million sales of new light-vehicles, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. That trend was halted in 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic and a semiconductor shortage slowed down vehicle production. New light-vehicle sales were just 14.43 million in 2020 and 14.97 million in 2021.\nOn a positive note, the electric vehicle market has been booming. EV registrations rose by 40% from 2021 to 2022 and another 21% the following year. While the industry is still heavily reliant on the state of California, it's clear that more consumers are making the shift to electric vehicles. State and federal incentives for EV purchases, like tax credits, and more competition among auto manufacturers have made electric vehicles an option for more households as well.\n-\nMethodology\nThe average number of vehicles per household was calculated by dividing each state's number of registered vehicles by its number of households.\n-\nSources\n- TitleMax (2022). \"U.S. Cities With the Highest and Lowest Vehicle Ownership.\"\n- U.S. Census Bureau (2024). \"2023 American Community Survey.\"\n- U.S. Department of Energy (2025). \"Change in U.S. Light-Duty Vehicle Registration Counts.\"\n- U.S. Department of Energy (2025). \"Electric Vehicle Registrations by State.\"\n- U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration (2017). \"Highway Statistics 2015.\"\n- U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration (2022). \"Highway Statistics 2020.\"\n- U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration (2024). \"Highway Statistics 2022.\"\n- U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration (2025). \"Highway Statistics 2023.\"\nOur Research Expert"

      "text": "Less than a generation ago, e-commerce was only in its infancy, born on the World Wide Web as a vision of entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos.\nToday, e-commerce accounts for almost $1.2 trillion in annual retail sales in the U.S., or 16% of the total retail industry. Globally, e-commerce sales total more than $5 trillion, led by companies such as Amazon (AMZN 0.23%) and China\u2019s Alibaba Group (BABA -1.52%), plus brick-and-mortar retailers such as Home Depot (HD 0.15%).\nThe tremendous growth in e-commerce has propelled a number of big winners on the stock market, but there's still plenty of opportunity left in online retail.

      "text": "Profitability ratios are a measure of a company's ability to generate income from revenue, balance sheet assets, or shareholder equity. These ratios are useful in understanding a company's business, evaluating a company's performance based on its history, and comparing multiple companies in the same industry. Higher profitability ratios mean a company is more efficient at producing profits for its shareholders.\nThis article will review the most common profitability ratios for investors and why they matter.\nUnderstanding profitability ratios\nUnderstanding profitability ratios\nThere are two main types of profitability ratios: margin ratios and return ratios.\nA margin ratio will tell you how well a company converts its revenue into profits. These ratios can tell investors the marginal cost of serving customers and shed light on the fixed costs associated with running the business. Improving margin ratios indicate the company is effectively leveraging its expenses to produce more profits for shareholders.\nReturn ratios will tell you how well the company uses the assets on its balance sheet to produce a profit. If a company requires a lot of assets to generate a dollar of income, that means it needs to invest heavily to increase its bottom line.\nProfitability ratios are most useful when used to compare companies in the same industry. If one company consistently has higher profitability ratios than competitors in the same industry, it's an indication of a competitive advantage. Investors should seek out businesses with competitive advantages that are trading at a fair price.\nInvestors should be aware of industry seasonality when assessing a company's historic profitability ratios. The retail and advertising industries generally have strong fourth quarters, but first-quarter results are much more muted. As such, it wouldn't be appropriate to compare profitability ratios in the first quarter to the previous year's fourth quarter for companies in those types of industries. In general, historical comparisons should be done with the same period from prior years.\nTypes of profitability ratios\nTypes of profitability ratios\nMargin ratios\nAs previously noted, margin ratios are a measure of how a company converts revenue into profits. The most common margin ratios are gross margin, operating margin, and net profit margin.\nGross margin compares gross profits to revenue. The core factor in determining gross margin is cost of goods sold. It only factors in costs directly related to the products sold and no other expenses in the business. If a company has a high gross margin relative to its peers, it's an indication that it's able to charge a premium for its products. Declining gross margins across the industry could indicate increased competition.\nOperating margin compares operating profit to revenue. On top of cost of goods sold, operating profit also factors in standard operating expenses such as marketing, sales, general, and administrative expenses. It doesn't include things like interest on debt or income taxes.\nOperating margin is a good measure of how efficient a company is in its operations. A fast-growing company may have a small or even negative operating margin, but it ought to show improvement over time as it scales revenue. Operating margin is also used to assess the quality of management since good management will find ways to improve profitability and efficiency.\nNet profit margin takes a company's bottom-line profits divided by revenue. It takes everything into account, including taxes and interest. If a company has a big debt load or high interest rates on its debt, it will show up in its net profit margin. If it can minimize taxes, that'll show up, too. However, investors should be aware of any one-time expenses or gains that might create anomalies in the net profit margin.\nReturn ratios\nReturn ratios measure how well a company uses its balance sheet -- one of the three main financial statements -- to generate profits. There are two return ratios for investors to pay attention to: return on assets and return on equity.\nReturn on assets looks at how well a company uses its assets and investments to generate income. A company that can deploy its assets effectively to generate a profit will do better than a company that's less efficient with its assets. An improving return on assets may indicate a company is seeing improved economies of scale as the business grows.\nReturn on equity looks only at how well a business uses shareholder equity to generate a profit. Generally speaking, a higher return on equity indicates a more efficient business, but a company could eschew equity in favor of debt to invest and boost assets. Using return on equity in combination with return on assets can be more helpful than looking at return on equity alone.\nHow to interpret profitability ratios\nHow to interpret profitability ratios\nLet's take a look at how to interpret profitability ratios in various scenarios.\nA company has historically had a very strong gross margin. It consistently produces a gross margin in the 60% range. However, its operating margin is very low -- just 2%. That's actually a significant improvement over the past few years when it was producing negative operating profits. This is typical of many growth stocks. Showing a positive operating profit margin for the first time can be a catalyst for a stock. It shows the company can scale the business and leverage operating expenses to become profitable in the long run.\nAnother situation is comparing two companies in the same industry. One has a gross margin of 40%, and the other has a gross margin of just 15%. The first company is able to charge a premium for its products and services, indicating a strong competitive advantage in the industry. However, the second company may be keeping its pricing low to increase its scale. Investors should also look at the company's respective operating margins to check.\nIf the second company's operating margins are in line with the first, it clearly has sufficient scale to offset the lower gross margin on its product sales. That could be an advantage for the second company.\nInvestors will want to see an increasing return on assets for most companies, but a decline in the profit ratio may be acceptable if it results in overall revenue and profit growth. Most importantly, investors want to see return on assets outpace the interest rate on company debt. If it doesn't, the company would be better off paying down its debt than investing in the business, which is a troubling sign.\nReturn on equity is a good indication of a company's growth potential. Since it indicates how well a company can use the funds it raised to increase profits, it also indicates the upper limit on earnings-per-share growth. If a company wants to keep growing, it needs to raise more cash to invest, but it would either have to issue additional shares to investors or raise debt (which comes at a cost). As such, return on equity is seen as something of an upper bound on potential earnings growth rates.\nRelated investing topics\nProfitability ratios are helpful tools\nProfitability ratios are helpful tools\nLearning about profitability ratios is essential for an investor to evaluate a business and its stock. They can help you compare companies in the same industry and better understand how each competitor uses its advantages to improve profitability. You can also see if management is executing on creating a more efficient and more profitable business for investors, leading to long-term profit improvements for investors.\nUltimately, profit ratios can tell you a lot about how well management is running a business and if it's a good stock to invest in. However, investors don't want to buy a good company at any price. You'll also want to learn how to determine if a stock is trading at a fair price before you start investing your money in it."

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."
