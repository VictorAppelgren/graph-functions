  "title": "Morgan Wallen Won't Submit His No. 1 Album To The Grammys This Year",
  "description": "The country singer has never received a Grammy nomination for any work on his solo albums.",
  "content": "Country singer Morgan Wallen won\u2019t submit his latest album, \u201cI\u2019m the Problem,\u201d for Grammy consideration.\n\nThe album, which was released in May and features duets with Tate McRae, Eric Church and Post Malone, was a commercial success, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. But the critical reception was mixed, with Rolling Stone giving the album three out of five stars.\n\nRelated: 'Elvis' Star Scouted Baseball Players' Backsides As He Bulked Up For New Movie\n\nBillboard and Hits Daily Double were the first to report on Wallen\u2019s decision to not submit the album for the awards.\n\nRelated: EWW! 'South Park' Gets Extra Raunchy In X-Rated New Trump Takedown\n\nWallen, who released his debut album in 2018, has only been recognized by the Recording Academy, which hosts the Grammy Awards, twice \u2014 neither time for his own songs. He received nominations for Best Country Song and Country Duo/Group Performance, both for his features on Post Malone songs.\n\nRelated: Dua Lipa Explains Why That Sheer White Dress She Wore To A Wedding Wasn't Actually Offensive\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why Wallen isn\u2019t submitting his work to the Grammys and his reps did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but other artists have boycotted the Grammys in the past, including Drake and The Weeknd, who have both been critical of the voting process. The Weeknd broke his boycott in February, when he performed at the Grammys. Before his performance, Harvey Mason Jr., the CEO of the Recording Academy, said in a speech that he listened to The Weeknd\u2019s criticism and redid the Grammys voting body, making it more diverse.\n\nWallen hasn\u2019t been one to play by the rules. While appearing as the musical guest on NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in March, Wallen walked off the show\u2019s stage while host Mikey Madison and the cast members were still saying their goodbyes. Immediately afterward, he posted a photo of his plane with the caption, \u201cGet me to God\u2019s country.\u201d He later said it wasn\u2019t anything personal and that he was just ready to get home.\n\nRelated: \u2018South Park\u2019 Turns Up The Heat On Trump With \u2018Perfect\u2019 Return Of Beloved Character\n\nIn 2021, Wallen was \u201cindefinitely\u201d suspended by his record label after he was caught on video saying a racial slur. The Academy of Country Music announced his \u201cDangerous: The Double Album\u201d wouldn\u2019t be eligible for its awards that year.\n\nWallen made news again in 2024 when he threw a chair off the roof of a bar in Nashville. He pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment.\n\nThe Grammys did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Kendall Jenner once found herself at the center of controversy for a risqu\u00e9 dress she wore to friend Lauren Perez\u2019s wedding in 2022.\nThe model\u2019s scandalous black gown included slits from her neck to her navel, which many commenters found \u201cinappropriate\u201d due to the amount of skin showing.\nThe social media firestorm eventually caused the bride herself to weigh in. Perez said Jenner looked \u201cstunning\u201d and said she personally \u201cloved\u201d the dress. Jenner said in response to Perez that she \u201cobvi asked for your approval in advance too.\u201d"

It\u2019s called Heard and McDonald Island,\u201d Johnson said as Trump.\n\u201cYou know, I had to mock up some artwork of McDonald Island,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI want to go to there. Get me to God\u2019s Country, right?\u201d he said, as the audience burst into laughter and applause. \u201cRemember that? Wow.\u201d\nColin Jost later took a jab at Wallen during a \u201cWeekend Update\u201d segment.\n\u201cIn the past two days, investors have lost over $6 trillion,\u201d Jost said during another segment tackling Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\u201cMoney is leaving the stock market faster than Morgan Wallen at \u2018goodnights,\u2019\u201d he quipped, as the audience again roared with laughter.\nKenan Thompson is the only \u201cSNL\u201d cast member so far to publicly speak about Wallen\u2019s quick exit.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what goes through people\u2019s minds when they decide to do stuff like that,\u201d Thompson said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly published last week. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he understood the assignment or not, or if he was really feeling a certain kind of way.\u201d\nThompson said Wallen\u2019s exit was \u201cdefinitely a spike in the norm.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re so used to everybody just turning around and high-fiving us, everybody\u2019s saying, \u2018Good job, good job, good job,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo when there\u2019s a departure from that, it\u2019s like, \u2018Hmm, I wonder what that\u2019s about?\u2019\u201d\nThompson also added that he wasn\u2019t sure if Wallen \u201chad to go to the potty or something.\u201d\nWallen has not yet said anything about the incident though he is now selling \u201cGet me to God\u2019s Country\u201d merchandise on his website.\nThe country singer has had a rocky history with \u201cSNL.\u201d Back in October 2020, he was pulled from the show\u2019s lineup for violating COVID-19 safety guidelines.\nWhen he returned that December, he cracked jokes about the incident during his appearance."

Pressley then asked Wallen if he was a handyman around the house.\n\u201cCould you fix a TV \u2015\u201d Pressley said before pausing, \u201cif it was on \u2018SNL\u2019?\u201d\nWallen laughed, then said, \u201cI could change it, for sure.\u201d\nWallen made headlines in late March when he walked off the \u201cSNL\u201d stage, while the rest of the cast and guest host Mikey Madison were still saying their goodbyes. Later that night, Wallen posted a photo of his private jet on social media with the caption, \u201cGet me to God\u2019s country.\u201d The caption soon became a meme with social media users writing it alongside irrelevant photos, including \u201cSNL\u201d writer Josh Patten, who posted a photo of a Krispy Kreme truck with the caption.\nLongtime \u201cSNL\u201d cast member Kenan Thompson said Wallen\u2019s exit was \u201cdefinitely a spike in the norm\u201d and thought Wallen \u201chad to go to the potty or something.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what goes through people\u2019s minds when they decide to do stuff like that,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he understood the assignment or not, or if he was really feeling a certain kind of way.\u201d\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, \u201cSNL\u201d asked Wallen to appear in the pre-taped musical sketch \u201cBig Dumb Line,\u201d but he \u201cwasn\u2019t available.\u201d Instead, Joe Jonas filled in.\nIn October 2020, Wallen was disinvited from performing on \u201cSNL\u201d after videos surfaced of him partying and not adhering to social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. A few months later, he was invited back and even made fun of the ordeal in a skit."

He went so far as to announce he was boycotting the Grammys,\u201d Mason said from the Grammys stage. \u201cThat made for some interesting reading over breakfast. But you know what? Criticism is, okay. I heard him. I felt his conviction.\u201d\nThe Weeknd had been riding high in 2020, smashing streaming records with his single \u201cBlinding Lights.\u201d He spoke up after he failed to garner a single Grammy nomination that year.\nMason let it be known that the Canadian singer was heard loud and clear.\n\u201cWhat we all want is an organization dedicated to the wellbeing of all music makers and one that reflects the entire music community for now and for future generations,\u201d Mason said on stage. \u201cSo over the past few years, we\u2019ve listened, we\u2019ve acted, and we\u2019ve changed.\u201d\nSince then, Mason said, the Recording Academy has \u201cremade our membership, adding more than 3,000 women voting members.\u201d\n\u201cThe Grammy electorate is now younger, nearly 40% people of color, and 66% of our members are new,\u201d Mason said. \u201cSince we started our transformation this year, the 13,000 voting members of the Academy nominated their peers and voted for the winners that you\u2019re seeing on this stage tonight.

      "text": "Morgan Wallen Is America\u2019s Problem\nYou could say that Morgan Wallen has achieved his 2020s pop domination by brute force. His last two albums \u2014 2021\u2019s Dangerous: The Double Album and 2023\u2019s One Thing at a Time \u2014 clock in at 30 and 36 tracks respectively, which thanks to streaming-era math is a boon to one\u2019s chart fortunes. Just look at the current albums chart: Both releases are still in the Billboard 200\u2019s top ten as of this writing, with Thing at Number 4 and Dangerous at Number 9, and they\u2019ve each clocked in more than 100 weeks in the album chart\u2019s highest echelon. But other artists have released data dumps without being rewarded by long-term listening and tours that consist of multi-night stadium stints. What is it about Wallen \u2014 a former baseball player and The Voice castoff from small-town Tennessee with a battery-acid-dipped drawl and a lot of search results that also include the word \u201ccontroversy\u201d \u2014 that makes him such a draw?\nI\u2019m the Problem, Wallen\u2019s fourth album, has a title that could double as a cheeky answer to that question. The song named after it, which leads off the track listing, is a stormy chronicle of a toxic relationship that seems too doomed to fail (\u201cIf I\u2019m such a waste of breath/Such a waste of time/Then why you on your way to waste another Friday night?\u201d Wallen grouses on the bridge). Placing it front and center reinforces the love-me-or-hate-me stance that Wallen has cultivated since his breakthrough in the late 2010s \u2014 an attitude that seems very attuned to a particular strain of the modern American mood, and one driven home by his albums\u2019 heft.\nThis is why writing about Wallen\u2019s on-record output can be a tricky thing. He has a bristly persona and history of not-great acts that can bleed into some listeners\u2019 perceptions of him \u2014 and it isn\u2019t helped by lines like \u201cBaby I can\u2019t wait to see the look on your pretty face, when I break your heart in two,\u201d which appears on the blithely spiteful poison-pen letter \u201cKiss Her in Front of You.\u201d But his polished (if slightly dour) country-rock is, as a representation of the form, well-crafted and hooky while not being immune to the occasional stylistic left turn: The existentially troubled line-disco cut \u201cLove Somebody\u201d could fit in on a Dua Lipa record with a couple of tweaks (it actually interpolates the British DJ Digital Farm Animals\u2019 2018 EDM-pop cut \u201cTokyo Nights,\u201d which Lipa also flipped on her punchy 2024 single \u201cTraining Season\u201d), while the whiskey-and-regret-soaked \u201cGenesis\u201d has a weary gleam that recalls mid-period Fleetwood Mac, and the duet with moody Canadian upstart Tate McRae, \u201cWhat I Want,\u201d has trap snares fluttering around the chorus.\nNot that his music is only ear-catching when it\u2019s melding country with something else. \u201cJack and Jill,\u201d which recounts the tale of two small-town kids whose big dreams get buried by a pile of empty bottles, is arrestingly told, with a gut-punch of a final line: \u201cThe preacher they used when they said \u2018I do\u2019/Is reading out of Psalm 23.\u201d Wallen\u2019s weary wail is well-suited to this particular tale of heartland heartbreak \u2014wouldn\u2019t you be at your wit\u2019s end to see two more lives wasted like this? \u2014 and it helps the ballad, which is tucked into the album\u2019s back half, stand out. Another track that comes near the end, the stomping country-rocker \u201cWorking Man\u2019s Song,\u201d also captures the zeitgeist: \u201cI punch the clock, wanna punch a ticket to New York and punch the boss,\u201d he grumbles over sturdy guitars, and even though he\u2019s reached the echelon of stadium-headliner stardom where he\u2019s probably a boss in some sense, the roiling anger feels real. (Another track with a more generalized antipathy toward city slickers, the HARDY-assisted \u201cCome Back As a Redneck,\u201d is less successful despite its music having enough bless-your-heart stevia to turn a swimming pool into sweet tea.)\nA more generous reading of Wallen\u2019s penchant for albums that blow past the 90-minute mark might be that he feels like he has too much going on to fit his life into a standard release\u2019s track listing, and in order to fully express himself he (with the help of Nashville\u2019s top-flight songwriters and longtime producer Joey Moi) needs to gather up his feelings, contradictions and all, into an omnibus not dissimilar to those end-of-season Instagram photo compilations \u2014 although he\u2019s more likely to flaunt his rougher moments than your typical poster. \u201cSuperman,\u201d a free-flowing note to his son, gets into his public scrapes (\u201cOne day you\u2019re gonna see my mugshot/From a night when I got a little too drunk\u201d is its opening line) and alcoholism (\u201cNow and then that bottle\u2019s my kryptonite/Brings a man of steel down to his knees\u201d) while admitting, \u201cI hope I\u2019m always your hero,\u201d a sentiment that\u2019s animated songs about the surprises that accompany parenthood since way before \u201cCat\u2019s in the Cradle\u201d was first committed to vinyl.\nPerhaps that willingness to nod toward his fuck-ups and air out his ugly thoughts is why people keep returning to Wallen and his music. After all, his official merch store is selling a necklace that declares, in precisely rendered sterling silver, that its wearer is, just like Wallen, \u201cThe Problem\u201d \u2014 a bit of branded aspirationalism that also nods to why Wallen is one of this moment\u2019s biggest stars. Yes, his public behavior and the music\u2019s country trappings \u2014 from the copious shout-outs to whiskey to the banjos and mandolins \u2014 might make him seem more amenable to one side of 2025\u2019s ever-widening political divide. But the \u201clove me or leave me\u201d attitude that animates his glowering songs is as American as apple pie \u2014 or apple pie whiskey."

      "text": "As Morgan Wallen\u2019s I\u2019m the Problem sits at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 for the 11th non-consecutive week, Billboard has learned that his team will not submit the album, any of the 37 songs on the voluminous set, or Wallen for consideration for the 68th Grammy Awards, to be held Feb. 1, 2026.\nHits Daily Double broke the news earlier Tuesday (Aug. 19) that the album would not be submitted, but Billboard understands that the action goes further and includes not putting Wallen forward in any category, such as best country solo performance, or any of the seven songs that he co-wrote in any song categories in any genre or general field.\nHowever, Wallen and his camp are not stopping the other songwriters from submitting their works from the album, which has already spawned four No. 1s on Billboard\u2019s Country Airplay chart and three chart-toppers on the Hot Country Songs chart. It has also generated one No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100: Wallen\u2019s duet with Tate McRae, \u201cWhat I Want.\u201d\nTrending on Billboard\nWallen, whose 2021 Big Loud/Republic album Dangerous: The Double Album is Billboard\u2018s No. 1 album of the first 25 years of the 21st century, is removing himself from consideration from an awards body whose voters have almost totally ignored his musical contributions.\nThe only Grammy nominations that the country superstar has received in his nearly 10-year career were for his work on Post Malone\u2019s F1 Trillion album. Their chart-topping duet, \u201cI Had Some Help,\u201d received nods for best country duo/group performance and best country song for the awards presented this past February. Wallen has never received any nominations for any works from his solo albums.\nThough Wallen received no Grammy nominations, including best new artist, through the first few years of his budding superstardom, he further lost momentum in early 2021 when he was captured on video by a neighbor using a racial slur. He subsequently apologized and went to rehab.\nThough both the Academy of Country Music Awards and the Country Music Association Awards disqualified Wallen from eligibility for individual artist awards for one year, the Grammy Awards did not disqualify Wallen from being nominated.\nThe country-oriented awards, have welcomed Wallen back to a varying degree. Since the ACM and CMA Awards the bans were lifted, Wallen has received 13 CMA Awards nominations, and won the big one, entertainer of the year, in 2024.\nAt the ACM Awards, he has received 20 nominations since the scandal, winning three \u2014 album of the year in 2022 for Dangerous: The Double Album and an ACM Milestone Award that same year, and male artist of the year in 2023.\nAs of this week, Wallen has logged 40 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 \u2014 a total matched or exceeded by only eight artists in the chart\u2019s nearly 70-year history. All eight of those artists have won multiple Grammys.\nAdditionally, Wallen is one of only 19 artists to log 30 or more weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Wallen and The Monkees are the only artists with 30 or more weeks at No. 1 who have not won a Grammy.\nFirst-round voting for the Grammy Awards runs Oct. 3-15 with nominations due to be announced Nov. 7.\nWallen\u2019s action is extraordinarily rare, but not unprecedented among superstars. Both The Weeknd and Drake previously decided not to submit in the Grammy process. Their actions also followed years of feeling under-recognized.\nThe Weeknd decided to boycott the ceremony following his controversial shut-out at the 2021 ceremony. The R&B superstar was thought to be a strong contender for album of the year for his fourth LP After Hours, which spent four consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, as well as for record and song of the year for his smash hit \u201cBlinding Lights,\u201d which became Billboard \u2018s biggest Hot 100 song of all time. But when the 2021 Grammy Award nominations were revealed, The Weeknd\u2019s name was nowhere to be found.\nThe Weeknd initially expressed his frustration toward the Recording Academy by tweeting, \u201cThe Grammys remain corrupt.\u201d In his second Twitter missive, he wrote that he went from planning a Grammys performance to being \u201cnot invited.\u201d The Weeknd later stated in a Billboard cover story that his snub in the top categories felt like \u201ca sucker punch.\u201d\nLike The Weeknd, Wallen may find himself nominated despite his decision not to submit, for example, if McRae\u2019s team submits their duet. The Weeknd was up for three awards at the 2022 ceremony thanks to his contributions to recordings by Ye (formerly Kanye West) and Doja Cat.\nDrake blasted the Grammys following The Weeknd\u2019s surprising shut-out at the 2021 Grammys. \u201cI think we should stop allowing ourselves to be shocked every year by the disconnect between impactful music and these awards and just accept that what once was the highest form of recognition may no longer matter to the artists that exist now and the ones that come after,\u201d he wrote on Instagram. \u201cThis is a great time for somebody to start something new that we can build up over time and pass on to the generations to come.\u201d\nLeading up to the 2022 Grammy Awards, Drake was initially announced as a nominee for best rap performance (for \u201cWay 2 Sexy,\u201d featuring Future and Young Thug) and best rap album (for Certified Lover Boy), but asked to have his name withdrawn from contention for both awards on Dec. 6, 2021. The Recording Academy honored his request and officially removed his nominations for both awards.\nSince then, Drake has received eight nominations \u2013 all for collaborations with other artists.\nWallen\u2019s representative declined to comment. Representatives from Big Loud, Republic and the Recording Academy did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Pressley then asked Wallen if he was a handyman around the house.\n\u201cCould you fix a TV \u2015\u201d Pressley said before pausing, \u201cif it was on \u2018SNL\u2019?\u201d\nWallen laughed, then said, \u201cI could change it, for sure.\u201d\nWallen made headlines in late March when he walked off the \u201cSNL\u201d stage, while the rest of the cast and guest host Mikey Madison were still saying their goodbyes. Later that night, Wallen posted a photo of his private jet on social media with the caption, \u201cGet me to God\u2019s country.\u201d The caption soon became a meme with social media users writing it alongside irrelevant photos, including \u201cSNL\u201d writer Josh Patten, who posted a photo of a Krispy Kreme truck with the caption.\nLongtime \u201cSNL\u201d cast member Kenan Thompson said Wallen\u2019s exit was \u201cdefinitely a spike in the norm\u201d and thought Wallen \u201chad to go to the potty or something.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what goes through people\u2019s minds when they decide to do stuff like that,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he understood the assignment or not, or if he was really feeling a certain kind of way.\u201d\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, \u201cSNL\u201d asked Wallen to appear in the pre-taped musical sketch \u201cBig Dumb Line,\u201d but he \u201cwasn\u2019t available.\u201d Instead, Joe Jonas filled in.\nIn October 2020, Wallen was disinvited from performing on \u201cSNL\u201d after videos surfaced of him partying and not adhering to social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. A few months later, he was invited back and even made fun of the ordeal in a skit."

      "text": "Country singer Morgan Wallen won\u2019t submit his latest album, \u201cI\u2019m the Problem,\u201d for Grammy consideration.\nThe album, which was released in May and features duets with Tate McRae, Eric Church and Post Malone, was a commercial success, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. But the critical reception was mixed, with Rolling Stone giving the album three out of five stars.\nBillboard and Hits Daily Double were the first to report on Wallen\u2019s decision to not submit the album for the awards.\nWallen, who released his debut album in 2018, has only been recognized by the Recording Academy, which hosts the Grammy Awards, twice \u2014 neither time for his own songs. He received nominations for Best Country Song and Country Duo/Group Performance, both for his features on Post Malone songs.\nIt\u2019s unclear why Wallen isn\u2019t submitting his work to the Grammys and his reps did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but other artists have boycotted the Grammys in the past, including Drake and The Weeknd, who have both been critical of the voting process. The Weeknd broke his boycott in February, when he performed at the Grammys. Before his performance, Harvey Mason Jr., the CEO of the Recording Academy, said in a speech that he listened to The Weeknd\u2019s criticism and redid the Grammys voting body, making it more diverse.\nWallen hasn\u2019t been one to play by the rules. While appearing as the musical guest on NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in March, Wallen walked off the show\u2019s stage while host Mikey Madison and the cast members were still saying their goodbyes. Immediately afterward, he posted a photo of his plane with the caption, \u201cGet me to God\u2019s country.\u201d He later said it wasn\u2019t anything personal and that he was just ready to get home.\nIn 2021, Wallen was \u201cindefinitely\u201d suspended by his record label after he was caught on video saying a racial slur. The Academy of Country Music announced his \u201cDangerous: The Double Album\u201d wouldn\u2019t be eligible for its awards that year.\nWallen made news again in 2024 when he threw a chair off the roof of a bar in Nashville. He pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment.\nThe Grammys did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
