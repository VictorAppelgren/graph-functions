      "feedback": "High-signal feedback in one paragraph: the draft overreaches with a four-regime wash of id-heavy prose and tangled anecdotes, diluting a crisp, testable house view; tighten to 4–6 sentences/bullets that map directly to a single three-regime tree (A/B/C or 1–3) with a explicit first-principles causal chain: AI productivity lifts potential growth and capex/profits, which compresses risk premia and sustains durable-goods demand; policy design (income supports vs employment incentives) shifts labor supply and inflation dynamics via a clear mechanism; EV profitability risks hinge on ramp timing and cost structure, and external balance/real-rate shocks reprice risk premia and sector leadership; anchor every assertion to source IDs (avoid mixed anecdotes) and eliminate non-source elements (e.g., personal or policy anecdotes not tied to NL5YYTLF2, WTNT85IPR, 22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW, UPV3X2MQ6, PCSO, SGB2PAZGK, STBVARD8F); replace broad narrative with concrete catalysts/triggers/invalidations per regime with numeric anchors drawn strictly from the provided IDs (for example: 0–1 month tariff pass‑through at 25% on imported vehicles (WTNT85IPR); GM onshore capex ~$4B toward >2M U.S.-built vehicles (WTNT85IPR; Scraped Source 4); Ford YTD +17%, dividend ~5.18%, EV losses, EBIT ~4.3%, ROIC ~10.1% (22PL3Q360; W2622L6WW); Range productivity 1–1.5% annually and Pacaso TAM ~$1.8T with Range/AUM metrics ~$6B and 0% AUM fees (UPV3X2MQ6; PCSO)); ensure the near-term timeline is a single, tight watch-list (0–1/1–3/3–6 months) with explicit triggers and invalidations (tariff timing, Medicaid work‑requirements uptake, GM capacity cadence, AI-wealth-platform adoption, Nvidia momentum) and a concise risk matrix; purge extraneous divergences and ensure the final output adheres to the 4–6 sentence/bullet format, delivering a defendable, decision-useful house view with quantified anchors and precise source citations after each claim.",
