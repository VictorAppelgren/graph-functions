      "feedback": "High-signal critique and concrete edits: the draft correctly centers the snapback mechanism and the late-August 2025 deadline but treats diplomacy in isolation from a multi-year, regime-structure framework; to reach world-class quality, recast into a regime-based, first-principles macro frame (invariants: policy reaction functions of the E3, Iran’s BoP/external position, terms of trade, and external financing costs; regime states: (A) snapback activated, (B) extended negotiations with partial relief, (C) no deal/continued stalemate) and specify clear transition conditions (deadline hit, extension offered/accepted, renewed IAEA cooperation) and probabilities anchored to the source timeline. Build a explicit causal chain from political triggers to market pricing: E3 signaling and snapback credibility raise sanctions risk premia and Iran’s external financing costs, constrict external access, depress the rial and import-capacity channel, and affect oil revenue/flow assumptions; tie this to observable market signals (risk spreads, sovereign credit perception, energy backlog) in a way that can be tested over years; define base-case plus two to three scenarious with entry/exit triggers and invalidation conditions (e.g., Iran resumes IAEA cooperation or an extension is formally agreed, vs. a renewed conflict or unilateral snapback). Quantify where possible using only the source data: end-August 2025 as the de facto trigger; the snapback mechanism as the legal pathway; Iran’s enrichment level (60%) and the note that IAEA ties have been limited or suspended since the war; use these as anchors for regime-detection thresholds rather than vague adjectives. Strengthen “what to watch” with concrete signals: (i) public E3/IAEA statements and any Istanbul-style diplomatic progress, (ii) Iran’s re-engagement with the IAEA, (iii) any formal extension/negotiating framework, (iv) timing of external-financing cost shifts or currency stress indicators. Ensure the write-up uses only FRDXP10EY as the source, harmonizes all references to that ID, and removes any non-sourced or speculative data; tighten the prose to a single, structured paragraph that clearly separates base case, alternative paths, catalysts/triggers, invalidation, and the multi-year transmission to pricing, with a concise confidence statement.",
