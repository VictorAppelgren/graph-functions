  "content": "The past few decades have seen almost unimaginable advances in compute performance and efficiency, enabled by Moore\u2019s Law and underpinned by scale-out commodity hardware and loosely coupled software. This architecture has delivered online services to billions globally and put virtually all of human knowledge at our fingertips.\n\nBut the next computing revolution will demand much more. Fulfilling the promise of AI requires a step-change in capabilities far exceeding the advancements of the internet era. To achieve this, we as an industry must revisit some of the foundations that drove the previous transformation and innovate collectively to rethink the entire technology stack. Let\u2019s explore the forces driving this upheaval and lay out what this architecture must look like.\n\nFor decades, the dominant trend in computing has been the democratization of compute through scale-out architectures built on nearly identical, commodity servers. This uniformity allowed for flexible workload placement and efficient resource utilization. The demands of gen AI, heavily reliant on predictable mathematical operations on massive datasets, are reversing this trend.\n\nWe are now witnessing a decisive shift towards specialized hardware \u2014 including ASICs, GPUs, and tensor processing units (TPUs) \u2014 that deliver orders of magnitude improvements in performance per dollar and per watt compared to general-purpose CPUs. This proliferation of domain-specific compute units, optimized for narrower tasks, will be critical to driving the continued rapid advances in AI.\n\nBeyond ethernet: The rise of specialized interconnects\n\nThese specialized systems will often require \u201call-to-all\u201d communication, with terabit-per-second bandwidth and nanosecond latencies that approach local memory speeds. Today\u2019s networks, largely based on commodity Ethernet switches and TCP/IP protocols, are ill-equipped to handle these extreme demands.\n\nAs a result, to scale gen AI workloads across vast clusters of specialized accelerators, we are seeing the rise of specialized interconnects, such as ICI for TPUs and NVLink for GPUs. These purpose-built networks prioritize direct memory-to-memory transfers and use dedicated hardware to speed information sharing among processors, effectively bypassing the overhead of traditional, layered networking stacks.\n\nThis move towards tightly integrated, compute-centric networking will be essential to overcoming communication bottlenecks and scaling the next generation of AI efficiently.\n\nFor decades, the performance gains in computation have outpaced the growth in memory bandwidth. While techniques like caching and stacked SRAM have partially mitigated this, the data-intensive nature of AI is only exacerbating the problem.\n\nThe insatiable need to feed increasingly powerful compute units has led to high bandwidth memory (HBM), which stacks DRAM directly on the processor package to boost bandwidth and reduce latency. However, even HBM faces fundamental limitations: The physical chip perimeter restricts total dataflow, and moving massive datasets at terabit speeds creates significant energy constraints.\n\nThese limitations highlight the critical need for higher-bandwidth connectivity and underscore the urgency for breakthroughs in processing and memory architecture. Without these innovations, our powerful compute resources will sit idle waiting for data, dramatically limiting efficiency and scale.\n\nToday\u2019s advanced machine learning (ML) models often rely on carefully orchestrated calculations across tens to hundreds of thousands of identical compute elements, consuming immense power. This tight coupling and fine-grained synchronization at the microsecond level imposes new demands. Unlike systems that embrace heterogeneity, ML computations require homogeneous elements; mixing generations would bottleneck faster units. Communication pathways must also be pre-planned and highly efficient, since delays in a single element can stall an entire process.\n\nThese extreme demands for coordination and power are driving the need for unprecedented compute density. Minimizing the physical distance between processors becomes essential to reduce latency and power consumption, paving the way for a new class of ultra-dense AI systems.\n\nThis drive for extreme density and tightly coordinated computation fundamentally alters the optimal design for infrastructure, demanding a radical rethinking of physical layouts and dynamic power management to prevent performance bottlenecks and maximize efficiency.\n\nTraditional fault tolerance relies on redundancy among loosely connected systems to achieve high uptime. ML computing demands a different approach.\n\nFirst, the sheer scale of computation makes over-provisioning too costly. Second, model training is a tightly synchronized process, where a single failure can cascade to thousands of processors. Finally, advanced ML hardware often pushes to the boundary of current technology, potentially leading to higher failure rates.\n\nInstead, the emerging strategy involves frequent checkpointing \u2014 saving computation state \u2014 coupled with real-time monitoring, rapid allocation of spare resources and quick restarts. The underlying hardware and network design must enable swift failure detection and seamless component replacement to maintain performance.\n\nToday and looking forward, access to power is a key bottleneck for scaling AI compute. While traditional system design focuses on maximum performance per chip, we must shift to an end-to-end design focused on delivered, at-scale performance per watt. This approach is vital because it considers all system components \u2014 compute, network, memory, power delivery, cooling and fault tolerance \u2014 working together seamlessly to sustain performance. Optimizing components in isolation severely limits overall system efficiency.\n\nAs we push for greater performance, individual chips require more power, often exceeding the cooling capacity of traditional air-cooled data centers. This necessitates a shift towards more energy-intensive, but ultimately more efficient, liquid cooling solutions, and a fundamental redesign of data center cooling infrastructure.\n\nBeyond cooling, conventional redundant power sources, like dual utility feeds and diesel generators, create substantial financial costs and slow capacity delivery. Instead, we must combine diverse power sources and storage at multi-gigawatt scale, managed by real-time microgrid controllers. By leveraging AI workload flexibility and geographic distribution, we can deliver more capability without expensive backup systems needed only a few hours per year.\n\nThis evolving power model enables real-time response to power availability \u2014 from shutting down computations during shortages to advanced techniques like frequency scaling for workloads that can tolerate reduced performance. All of this requires real-time telemetry and actuation at levels not currently available.\n\nSecurity and privacy: Baked in, not bolted on\n\nA critical lesson from the internet era is that security and privacy cannot be effectively bolted onto an existing architecture. Threats from bad actors will only grow more sophisticated, requiring protections for user data and proprietary intellectual property to be built into the fabric of the ML infrastructure. One important observation is that AI will, in the end, enhance attacker capabilities. This, in turn, means that we must ensure that AI simultaneously supercharges our defenses.\n\nThis includes end-to-end data encryption, robust data lineage tracking with verifiable access logs, hardware-enforced security boundaries to protect sensitive computations and sophisticated key management systems. Integrating these safeguards from the ground up will be essential for protecting users and maintaining their trust. Real-time monitoring of what will likely be petabits/sec of telemetry and logging will be key to identifying and neutralizing needle-in-the-haystack attack vectors, including those coming from insider threats.\n\nThe rhythm of hardware upgrades has shifted dramatically. Unlike the incremental rack-by-rack evolution of traditional infrastructure, deploying ML supercomputers requires a fundamentally different approach. This is because ML compute does not easily run on heterogeneous deployments; the compute code, algorithms and compiler must be specifically tuned to each new hardware generation to fully leverage its capabilities. The rate of innovation is also unprecedented, often delivering a factor of two or more in performance year over year from new hardware.\n\nTherefore, instead of incremental upgrades, a massive and simultaneous rollout of homogeneous hardware, often across entire data centers, is now required. With annual hardware refreshes delivering integer-factor performance improvements, the ability to rapidly stand up these colossal AI engines is paramount.\n\nThe goal must be to compress timelines from design to fully operational 100,000-plus chip deployments, enabling efficiency improvements while supporting algorithmic breakthroughs. This necessitates radical acceleration and automation of every stage, demanding a manufacturing-like model for these infrastructures. From architecture to monitoring and repair, every step must be streamlined and automated to leverage each hardware generation at unprecedented scale.\n\nThe rise of gen AI marks not just an evolution, but a revolution that requires a radical reimagining of our computing infrastructure. The challenges ahead \u2014 in specialized hardware, interconnected networks and sustainable operations \u2014 are significant, but so too is the transformative potential of the AI it will enable.\n\nIt is easy to see that our resulting compute infrastructure will be unrecognizable in the few years ahead, meaning that we cannot simply improve on the blueprints we have already designed. Instead, we must collectively, from research to industry, embark on an effort to re-examine the requirements of AI compute from first principles, building a new blueprint for the underlying global infrastructure. This in turn will result in fundamentally new capabilities, from medicine to education to business, at unprecedented scale and efficiency.\n\nAmin Vahdat is VP and GM for machine learning, systems and cloud AI at Google Cloud.",
