  "content": "Sophie Turner is remembering the time she accidentally ended a celebrity couple\u2019s engagement. \n\n\n\nWhile visiting Late Night on Thursday, the Game of Thrones alum and host Seth Meyers recalled meeting for the very first time at a 2014 San Diego Comic-Con party. \n\n\n\n\u201cThat night was actually quite crazy for me,\u201d Turner confessed.\n\nWhen asked what went wrong, the X-Men actress detailed an uncomfortable encounter that she had with an undisclosed celebrity couple at the event that may have led them to call off their engagement.\n\n\u201cI really can\u2019t name names or I\u2019ll get in a lot of trouble,\u201d Turner said of the couple. \"So I brought my best friend from my school days with me, and she saw this actor that she loved. And she obviously just goes to me, like, \u2018Can you just say hi?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nTurner admitted that she \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d the actor that her friend was so infatuated with at the time, but gave him a quick smile and a wave regardless. \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd that was it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then later on, I see this girl looking at me, and she\u2019s a famous actress. And I was like, \u2018Oh, I have to go and tell her how much she means to me.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo she made her way across the party to greet her. \u201cI dance on over and she goes, \u2018Can you stop f---ing flirting with my fianc\u00e9?\u2019\u201d Turner recalled. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Who\u2019s your fianc\u00e9?\u2019 She points at the guy that I\u2019d waved at. And I have no idea who this man is.\u201d \n\n\n\nIt only went further downhill from there. \u201cAnd then turns out, I think they broke their engagement off that night because of my [wave],\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I held this power!\u201d\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n\n\nMeyers was certainly surprised by the reveal. \u201cWell I hope you said to your school friend, \u2018This is what happens when you ask me to wave to people!\u2019\u201d he joked. Turner quipped back, \"Yeah! 'Look what you did!'\"\n\nAlthough, Meyers did admit that it\u2019s \u201cvery funny\u201d to imagine someone flirting with your fianc\u00e9 and then casually dancing over to meet you later that same evening.\n\n\u201cLike, you\u2019re just sitting there thinking \u2018I hate that girl,\u2019\u201d he teased. \u201cAnd then [she\u2019s dancing toward you] like, \u2018Hey! Hate me more? Do you hate me more?\u2019\u201d \n\n\n\nA laughing Turner replied, \u201cI think she thought I was rubbing it in.\u201d\n\nWatch Turner discuss the awkward encounter in the clip above.",
