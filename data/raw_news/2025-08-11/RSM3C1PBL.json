  "description": "President Trump mentioned New York, Baltimore, Chicago and Oakland as cities where he may deploy the National Guard to crack down on crime.",
  "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 President Donald Trump suggested that he could deploy the National Guard to other major U.S. cities as he announced plans to send 800 National Guard troops into Washington, D.C. to combat crime in the nation's capital.\n\nTrump singled out New York City; Baltimore, Maryland; Chicago, Illinois; and Oakland, California during a Monday, Aug. 11, news conference as potential future targets in what would be a drastic escalation of federal presence on the streets of American cities.\n\n\"We're not going to lose our cities over this. This will go further. We're starting very strongly with D.C., and we're going to clean it up real quick,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump did not elaborate on plans for other cities. But one of the two executive actions he signed Aug. 11 directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to coordinate with governors of states and \"authorize the orders of any additional members of the National Guard to active service, as he deems necessary and appropriate, to augment this mission.\"\n\n\"We're going to take back our capital,\" Trump said. \"And then we'll look at other cities also. But other cities are studying what we're doing.\"\n\nEach of the cities that Trump mentioned are led by Democratic mayors in states with Democratic governors, who would could be less likely to request the Trump administration's intervention than Republican governors who are political allies of the president.\n\n\"Other cities are hopefully watching this.... And maybe they\u2019ll self-clean up,\" Trump said, adding they could be targeted if \"they don't learn their lesson\" and study his administration's moves in Washington. He said he plans to look at New York City next \"and if we need to, we're going to do the same thing in Chicago.\u201d\n\nIn a separate executive order, Trump invoked authority under Section 740 of the Home Rule Act to take control of Washington\u2019s police department. The move, authorized by federal law as part of the District of Columbia's unique status as a federal enclave, is not an option for Trump elsewhere.\n\nSecretary of Army Daniel Driscoll is set to lead the National Guard\u2019s operation in Washington.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon is also prepared to bring in additional National Guard units and other specialized units if needed. \u201cThey will be strong. They will be tough. And they will stand with their law enforcement partners,\u201d Hegseth said.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing new for DOD,\u201d he added, pointing to Trump\u2019s deployment of military troops at the United States-Mexico border to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nTrump reeled off a list of recent violent crimes in Washington, D.C. to justify his actions. Yet, volent crimes so far in 2025 are down 26% compared to last year, and homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department. Similarly, homicides in New York City are down in 2025 compared to the same time last year.\n\nAn FBI report released Aug. 5 found violent crime in 2024 dropped by 4.5% in the United States compared to 2023, with murder and non-negligent manslaughter decreasing by nearly 15%.\n\nTrump's authority to direct National Guard troops was challenged earlier this year after he tapped the California National Guard to quell protests over widespread deportations from increased immigration enforcement in the Los Angeles area. After Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged Trump's control over the troops, a judge ruled in favor of Trump.",

      "text": "June 3, 2025\nSafest May in Recorded History for Shootings and Murders\nEighth Straight Month of Declines in Major Crime Categories\nMore Than 22,000 Illegal Guns Removed Off the Streets Since the Start of the Adams Administration\nNew York, New York \u2013 Police Commissioner Jessica S. Tisch today announced that from January 2025 through May 2025, New York City experienced the lowest number of shootings and murders in recorded history and set the record for the lowest number of shootings and murders in May. New York City also experienced the safest Memorial Day on record, with the lowest number of shootings ever across the entire weekend and the first Memorial Day Sunday with zero shootings. These historic numbers helped drive the eighth straight month of declines in major crime categories with a 4.9% drop in May 2025 compared to the same time last year.\nFrom January 2025 to May 2025, New York City recorded 264 shootings and 112 murders, compared to the previous record low of 267 shootings in 2018 and 113 murders in 2014 and 2017. In May 2025 alone, New York City recorded 54 shootings and 18 murders. The previous record low was set in 2019, when New York City recorded 61 shootings and 19 murders.\n\u201cToday, the mayor announced an unprecedented achievement: the lowest number of shootings and homicides in recorded history over the first five months of the year,\u201d said NYPD Commissioner Tisch. \u201cResults like this never happen by accident, and certainly not at a time when the state\u2019s criminal justice laws have made a revolving door out of our criminal justice system. Here\u2019s how your mayor and your NYPD cops delivered the safest January\u2013May for gun violence in New York City\u2019s history: three-plus years of relentlessly going after guns on our streets and a data-driven policing strategy that puts more cops in the right places at the right times to do what they do better than anyone else in the world. We will not let up. Our summer violence reduction plan is bold and aggressive and designed to continue driving the same historic safety gains.\u201d\nThis is the result of the NYPD\u2019s commitment to seizing illegal guns and the Summer Violence Reduction Plan. So far in 2025, the NYPD has removed more than 2,265 illegal guns off the streets and removed a total of 22,027 since the start of the Adams administration in January 2022.\nThe NYPD\u2019s Summer Violence Reduction Plan is a citywide effort to reduce violence, strengthen enforcement, and ensure every New Yorker feels safe in the months ahead. The plan includes 70 summer deployment zones, covering 57 precincts, police service areas, and transit districts with more than 1,500 uniformed officers deployed to foot posts in precincts, public housing, and the subway system \u2014 all focused on high-priority crimes and shootings.\nSince it began on May 5, major crime in our Summer Zones during deployment is down nearly 28% \u2014 with shootings down 65%, felony assault down 52%, robbery down 25%, and grand larceny down 21%.\nIn addition to the declines in shootings and murders, burglary declined by 12.5% (989 vs. 1,130), robbery dropped by 5.4% (1,383 vs. 1,462), and grand larceny fell by 4% (4,007 vs. 4,175).\nIn the transit system, crime dropped by 5.6% (186 v. 197), thanks to the continued presence of NYPD officers throughout the subway and on every overnight train.\nThe number of incidents investigated by the NYPD\u2019s Hate Crime Task Force decreased by 47%, or 37 fewer incidents, compared to May of last year. While anti-Jewish hate crimes dropped by 54%, this category has continued to soar over others as 24 of the total 42 hate crimes reported in the month of May were anti-Jewish attacks.\nRape incidents increased by 25.9% in May compared to the same period in 2024 (175 vs. 139). The rise in reported incidents is partly attributed to September 2024\u2019s legislative changes broadening the legal definition of rape in New York State, which now includes additional forms of sexual assault. Many reported cases involved individuals known to each other. The NYPD continues to encourage survivors of sexual assault to come forward and report these incidents.\n*All crime statistics are preliminary and subject to further analysis, revision, or change. *\nIndex Crime Statistics: May 2025\n|\nMay 2025 |\nMay 2024 |\n+/- | % Change | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Murder | 18 | 33 | -15 | -45.5% |\n| Rape | 175 | 139 | 36 | 25.9% |\n| Robbery | 1383 | 1462 | -79 | -5.4% |\n| Felony Assault | 2566 | 2736 | -170 | -6.2% |\n| Burglary | 989 | 1130 | -141 | -12.5% |\n| Grand Larceny | 4007 | 4175 | -168 | -4.0% |\n| Grand Larceny Auto | 1222 | 1221 | 1 | 0.1% |\n| TOTAL | 10360 | 10896 | -536 | -4.9% |\nAdditional Statistics: May 2025\n|\nMay 2025 |\nMay 2024 |\n+/- |\n% Change | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|\nTransit\n|\n186 | 197 | -11 | -5.6% |\n|\nHousing\n|\n490 | 552 | -62 | -11.2% |\n|\nShooting Incidents\n|\n54 | 88 | -34 | -38.6% |\nRape Incident Reporting Statistics: May 2025\n(Reports filed from May 1 \u2013 May 30 in years indicated)\n| Year | Total Incidents Reported |\nIncident Occurred Same Year |\nIncident Occurred 1 Year Prior |\nIncident Occurred 2 Years Prior |\nIncident Occurred 3 Years Prior |\nIncident Occurred 4 Years Prior |\nIncident Occurred 5+ Years Prior |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|\n2025\n|\n176 | 143 | 21 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 7 |\n|\n2024\n|\n139 | 105 | 12 | 5 | 4 | 1 | 12 |\n|\n2023\n|\n125 | 99 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 12 |\n|\n2022\n|\n157 | 115 | 13 | 5 | 7 | 1 | 16 |\n|\n2021\n|\n115 | 82 | 18 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 9 |\n|\n2020\n|\n105 | 85 | 10 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 6 |\nRape continues to be underreported.

      "text": "Trump orders National Guard into Washington and takes over DC police: Live updates\nPresident Donald Trump said the federal government will take control of the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump said he will deploy National Guard troops to Washington, DC, as part of an aggressive federal effort to crack down on crime in the nation\u2019s capital.\nTrump said the federal government would also seize control of Washington's Metropolitan Police Department.\n\"We're taking our capital back,\" Trump said August 11. \"We're taking it back.\"\n\"I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,\" Trump said. \"This is Liberation Day in DC, and we're going to take our capital back.\"\nWashington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser called the moves \"unsettling and unprecedented.\"\nTrump's actions follow a high-profile assault on a former staffer of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), 19-year-old Edward Coristine, that occured in the early morning hours of Aug. 3. during an attempted carjacking.\nDOJ earlier said DC violent crime was at a 30-year low\nDespite claims of rising crime and violence in Washington by President Trump and his attorney general and FBI chief, the Justice Department itself announced in January that total violent crime for 2024 was down 35% from the year before.\nIn fact, crime in the capital \u201cis the lowest it has been in over 30 years,\u201d according to data collected by the Metropolitan Police Department included in a Jan. 3 statement by the Washington, D.C., U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\nThen-U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, credited the declines to a \"focus on the drivers of violence \u2212 those gangs or crews of people who are dealing drugs, protecting turf, committing carjackings and other robberies, all while armed.\u201d\nDuring an August 11 press conference, DC was described as one of the most unsafe and violent cities in the world by Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and Graves\u2019 recently confirmed replacement, former television personality Jeanine Pirro.\nBut the Justice Department in January said that in addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides were down 32%; robberies were down 39%; armed carjackings were down 53% and assaults with a dangerous weapon were down 27% when compared with 2023 levels. DOJ also said the District was reporting \u201cthe fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.\u201d\nIn 2024, Washington, DC,had the fourth-highest homicide rate among U.S. cities, after St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit.\n\u2212Josh Meyer\nTrump says on police response to protesters: \u2018You spit and we hit\u2019\nPresident Trump issued a stern warning to protesters in Washington, DC, and beyond during his Aug. 11 press briefing where he announced plans to federalize the city's police force and deploy National Guard troops: \u201cYou spit and we hit.\u201d\nIn making the remark, Trump said that he was aware of a recent incident in Navy Yard, a neighborhood located in southeast DC. Police arrested a minor on Aug. 9 who discharged a firearm at a group of teens, according to ABC 7 News.\nNavy Yard has seen other incidents of violence in the past, including fights breaking out among teens and a 25-year-old arrested and charged with assault on a police officer.\n\u201cThey're not going to be fighting back long,\u201d Trump said,\nApparently recalling previous street protests were officers showed restraint against demonstrators, Trump called on officers to use force.\n\u201cThey love to spit in the face of the police as the police are standing up there in uniform, they're standing and they're screaming at them an inch away from their face, and then they start spitting in their face. And I said you tell them, \u2018You spit and we hit,'\" Trump said. \u201cAnd they can hit real hard. It's a disgusting thing.\"\n\u2212Sudiksha Kochi\n\u2018Political theater,\u2019 says top Democrat\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., sharply criticized President Trump\u2019s takeover of the Washington D.C. police department as \u201cpolitical theater,\u201d and said the nation\u2019s capital doesn\u2019t need it because it\u2019s already reducing violent crime.\n\"What the president did this morning was political theater,\u201d said Durbin, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\u201cHis idea of federalizing the police force of D.C. ignores the reality,\u201d Durbin said at a news conference to discuss the Texas state House Democrats who are boycotting a Trump-backed push to redraw congressional districts.\n\u201cThey are making dramatic progress in reducing violent crime in D.C., so it's a typical move by this president to create chaos and uncertainty, and to draw the attention from other issues like Jeffrey Epstein,\" added Durbin, a longtime Democratic leader who that he will retire and not seek reelection in 2026.\n\u2212Josh Meyer\nTrump says he's looking at downgrading marijuana\nPresident Donald Trump said his administration is considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug.\n\"We're looking at reclassification and we'll make a determination over the next few weeks,\" Trump said during his Aug. 11 press conference.\nThough 45 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medicinal or recreational use, the federal government still classifies it as a Schedule I drug.\n-Sarah Wire\nTrump longs for completed White House ballroom\nPresident Trump brought up his plans to build a 90,000-square-foot ballroom in the White House to the overflowing room of journalists packed into his Aug. 11 media briefing.\n\u201cI would've certainly loved to have had it today,\" the president said of the construction project that isn't slated to be completed until 2029. \"We would've filled it up.\"\n\u2212Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\nHegseth to 'work with state governors' to use more National Guard troops\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth is authorized to \"work with state governors\" to use their states' National Guard troops \"if necessary\" to deploy Washington, D.C., according to Will Scharf, an aide to President Donald Trump.\nHegseth got the green light in the presidential memo that Trump signed directing National Guard troops into Washington, Scharf said. For National Guard troops from states other than the District of Columbia to carry out law enforcement actions, they must be deployed with the consent of their states' governor. - Cybele Mayes-Osterman\nTrump signs executive orders driving DC crackdown\nTrump signed two executive orders earlier in the day as part of his federal crackdown on Washington crime, White House Staff Secretary Will Scharf said.\nOne order invoked Section 40 of the Home Rule Act to allow the Trump administration to take control of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department\nSeparately, Trump signed a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy National Guard troops in Washington. He said the memorandum also authorized Hegseth to work with governors of other states to utilize their National Guards as well.\n\u2212Joey Garrison\nTrump: 800 D.C. National Guard troops will be mobilized\nPresident Donald Trump said 800 troops from the Washington, D.C., National Guard will be mobilized. He said more could be tapped to join them.\n\"If necessary we're going to move servicemembers directly to joining the guardsmen,\" he said.\n\u2212Cybele Mayes-Osterman\nTroops will be 'flowing into the streets of Washington'\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Washington, D.C., National Guard was mobilized the morning of August 11 at President Trump's direction.\n\"You will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming weeks,\" Hegseth said. Hegseth said other National Guard units and \"specialized units\" stood ready.\n\"They will be strong. They will be tough,\" he said.\n\"We will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement to ensure this city is safe, this city is beautiful.\"\n\u2212Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n'It\u2019s embarrassing,' Trump says of DC crime before Putin summit\nAs he announced the federal takeover of Washington, D.C., police, Trump said he didn\u2019t want to be talking the subject days before his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\u201cThis is a tragic emergency. And it's embarrassing for me to be up here,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm gonna see Putin. I'm going to Russia on Friday. I don't like being up here talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capitol was with graffiti all over the walls.\u201d\nThe leaders are scheduled to meet on Aug. 15 in Alaska to discuss an end to the three-year Russian war on Ukraine, in the first in-person meeting since Trump took office for his second term.\n\u2212Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\nTrump puts new DEA chief in charge of DC police\nTrump announced that Drug Enforcement Administrator Terrance Cole will take over Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be designated as the interim federal commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Department, okay?\u201d Trump told Cole, standing on the stage with him. \u201cAnd you run them tough, they're good. You have a lot of good people.\u201d\nCole was sworn in as DEA administrator on July 23, following his Senate confirmation.\n-Josh Meyer\nTrump declares public safety emergency, says Bondi will take command of DC police\nTrump said he is declaring a public safety emergency in Washington D.C. and announced Attorney General Pam Bondi will take command of the local Metropolitan Police Department.\nTrump said his new DEA administrator Terry Cole will serve as interim federal commissioner of the police department.\nTrump said he will notify Congress and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser about the moves.\n\u201cThis is an emergency. This is a tragic emergency,\u201d Trump said.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump suggests crime crackdown could extend to other US cities\nTrump seemed to suggest he could later pursue federal intervention to combat crime in places like Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to lose our cities over this,\u201d Trump said as he railed against what he called rising crime rates. \u201cAnd this will go further. We\u2019re starting very strongly with D.C., and we\u2019re going to clean it up real quick, very quickly.\u201d\nTrump was flanked by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as he gave his remarks.\n\u2212Joey Garrison\nTrump says he\u2019s deploying National Guard, taking control of police department\nTrump said he is sending National Guard troops to Washington D.C. and placing Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control to crack down on crime in the nation\u2019s capital.\nTrump cited authority under Section 740 of the Home Rule Act to take control of Washington\u2019s police department.\n\u201cThis is liberation day in D.C.,\" Trump said, touting his moves as \u201chistoric action to rescue our nation from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.\u201d\n\u2212Joey Garrison\nSen. Mike Lee: Time to take over DC\nAhead of Trump\u2019s press conference, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said now is the time for Congress to take control of the city.\n\u201cWe should pass the BOWSER Act in September and return full control of Washington to Congress,\u201d Lee said in an Aug. 11 post on X.\nThe legislation, dubbed \u201cBringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident\u201d was introduced earlier this year, and was named after D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser as a criticism of crime and alleged corruption.\nLee cited an ongoing scandal, for example, involving a D.C. police commander who in July was suspended for allegedly changing crime stats in his district. He also noted how in some news reports local residents said they were afraid to speak out about crime for fear of reprisal.\n\u2212Phillip M. Bailey, Deborah Berry\nWhite House says DC\u2019s murder rate leads other national capitals\nAhead of Trump\u2019s press conference, White House officials handed a chart to reporters in the press briefing room detailing how Washington D.C.\u2019s homicide rate is greater than those of several foreign capitals.\nWith about 27 murders per every 100,000 residents, Washington, D.C., has a higher homicide rate than Bogota, Colombia; Mexico City; Islamabad, Pakistan; Lima, Peru; and Ottawa, Canada, among others, according to the chart.\nEven so, violent crime in Washington D.C. is down 26% in 2025 compared to this time last year. In 2024, Washington, D.C., had the fourth-highest homicide rate among U.S. cities, after St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit, at 27.3 per 100,000 residents, a decline of 30.7% from 2023.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump's expected troop deployment recalls 2020 protest crackdown\nPresident Trump's expected announcement that he will send the military onto the streets of the nation's capital recalls his deployment of National Guard troops during his first term to suppress protests sparked by the police murder of George Floyd.\nTrump has threatened a massive crackdown on crime in Washington.\nNational Guard troops mobilized by the president in a \"federalized\" capacity are typically barred from carrying out the functions of law enforcement, but not if they're under state control. In the summer of 2020, Trump brought troops into Washington from other states under the permission of 11 governors \u2212 an unprecedented mobilization of state troops.\nTrump's authority to direct National Guard troops was challenged earlier this year after he tapped the California National Guard to quell protests over widespread deportations in the Los Angeles area. After Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged Trump's control over the troops, a judge ruled in favor of Trump.\n\u2212Cybele Mayes-Osterman\nDemocrats ask: What about Jan. 6?\nAhead of Trump's press conference, Democrats criticized Trump for failing to call in the National Guard during the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, while preparing to call in the military now to suppress street crime.\nMore than 1,575 people were charged in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection. At least 600 were charged with the felony of assaulting or impeding law enforcement, according to the Police Executive Research Forum.\n\u201cRemember January 6, 2021: Why did Trump fail to call out to DC National Guard? Don\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s lies,\u201d Donna Brazile, former acting chair of the Democratic National Committee, wrote on X.\nWashington's crime rate is down this year compared to 2024. Violent crimes are 26% lower than last year. Homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department.\n-Sudiksha Kochi, Josh Meyer and Zac Anderson\nNo DC crime surge, mayor says\nA spokesman for Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser declined to comment ahead of Trump\u2019s news conference.\nBut during an Aug. 10 appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d Bowser pushed back at Trump\u2019s claims of rising crime in Washington. \u201cWe are not experiencing a crime spike,\u201d the mayor said.\nBowser expressed concern about sending the National Guard into the capital, noting that Guard troops are not meant to enforce local laws.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about them not being used efficiently. And I just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our guard,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the president\u2019s call about how to deploy the guard.\u201d\nBowser, who is in her third mayoral term, has refrained from responding with hostility to Trump\u2019s threats about taking over Washington.\n\u2212Joey Garrison\n450 federal officers deployed on DC streets\nTrump's announcement comes as 450 officers from multiple federal agencies were deployed in high-traffic D.C. areas and other hotspots over the weekend on Aug. 9 and 10.\nThe officers are from 18 agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Secret Service.\nTrump ordered an increased law enforcement presence in D.C. on Aug. 8 after complaining about crime in the city, even as violent crime trended down.\nViolent crime is down 26% in DC in 2025\nThe White House pointed to several examples of violent crime in Washington this year including the May 21 fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a downtown museum (The suspect is from Chicago.) as well as the recent assault on Coristine.\nYet Washington's crime rate is down this year compared to 2024. Violent crimes are 26% lower than last year. Homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department. Violent crime declined by 35% in Washington from 2023 ro 2024, including homicides from 274 to 187.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump threatens to take over DC\nTrump has long denigrated Washington, D.C, which leans heavily Democratic. Last week, Trump threatened to take over governance of the district if the crime situation isn't improved \u2012 something he floated previously in February.\n\"If D.C. doesn\u2019t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they\u2019re not going to get away with it anymore,\" Trump said in an Aug. 5 post on Truth Social.\nSuch action would require approval by Congress.\nThe District of Columbia is a federal enclave under jurisdiction of the U.S. government. The District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 gave the city local governance, including an elected mayor and city council. Two congressional Republicans, Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, this month introduced legislation to repeal the Home Rule Act.\n-Joey Garrison\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

      "text": "Trump says he's looking at reclassifying marijuana at federal level\nIn 2024, DEA proposed a rule to transfer marijuana to Schedule III. That rule change has been on hold since March 2025.\nPresident Donald Trump said his administration is considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug.\n\"We're looking at reclassification and we'll make a determination over the next few weeks,\" Trump said at news conference August 11.\nThough 45 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medicinal or recreational use, the federal government still classifies it as a Schedule I drug.\nSchedule I drugs are defined as highly dangerous, addictive and without medical use. Marijuana has belonged to this class of drugs since the Controlled Substances Act was signed in 1970. If reclassified, marijuana would be treated the same as drugs like Tylenol with codeine and anabolic steroids, which can be prescribed by licensed health care providers and dispensed by licensed pharmacies.\nReclassifying marijuana would be the biggest change in marijuana policy the federal government has taken since the drug was first outlawed, but it would not make recreational usage legal under federal law.\nThe move began in 2022, when then-President Joe Biden asked the Department of Health and Human Services and the Drug Enforcement Administration to review how marijuana is scheduled. In 2023, Health and Human Services recommended that marijuana be moved to Schedule III. In 2024, DEA proposed a rule to transfer marijuana to Schedule III. That rule change has been on hold since March 2025.\nTrump said the decision is complicated, weighing the benefits of marijuana use for medical reasons against potential societal impacts.\n\"Some people like it, some people hate it. Some people hate the whole concept of marijuana,\" he said."

      "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 740 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act (Public Law 93-198), as amended (section 740 of the Home Rule Act), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Crime is out of control in the District of Columbia. Washington, District of Columbia, is our Nation\u2019s capital and home to the central institutions of American governance. Yet rising violence in the capital now urgently endangers public servants, citizens, and tourists, disrupts safe and secure transportation and the proper functioning of the Federal Government, and forces the diversion of critical public resources toward emergency response and security measures. The city government\u2019s failure to maintain public order and safety has had a dire impact on the Federal Government\u2019s ability to operate efficiently to address the Nation\u2019s broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence.\nThe increase in violent crime in the heart of our Republic has consequences beyond the individual tragedies that have dominated media coverage. Such lawlessness also poses intolerable risks to the vital Federal functions that take place in the District of Columbia. Violence and crime hamper the recruitment and retention of essential Federal employees, undermine critical functions of Government and thus the well-being of the entire Nation, and erode confidence in the strength of the United States. These conditions are disgraceful anywhere, but particularly in the capital of our Nation and the seat of the Federal Government. Citizens, tourists, and Federal workers deserve peace and security, not fear and violence. The smooth functioning of executive departments and agencies, courts, diplomatic missions, and the Federal Government demands an effective law-enforcement mechanism capable of halting the precipitous rise in violent crime, not one that permits Government workers to be violently attacked by mobs or fatally shot close to the Federal buildings where they work.\nThe magnitude of the violent crime crisis places the District of Columbia among the most violent jurisdictions in the United States. In 2024, the District of Columbia averaged one of the highest robbery and murder rates of large cities nationwide. Indeed, the District of Columbia now has a higher violent crime, murder, and robbery rate than all 50 States, recording a homicide rate in 2024 of 27.54 per 100,000 residents. It also experienced the Nation\u2019s highest vehicle theft rate with 842.4 thefts per 100,000 residents \u2014 over three times the national average of 250.2 thefts per 100,000 residents. The District of Columbia is, by some measures, among the top 20 percent of the most dangerous cities in the world.\nAs President, I have a solemn duty to take care that our laws are faithfully executed, and a sacred responsibility to protect the safety and security of United States citizens who live in and visit our Nation\u2019s capital, including Federal workers who live or commute into the District of Columbia. These conditions cannot persist. We will make the District of Columbia one of the safest cities in the world, not the most dangerous.\nSec. 2. Services of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia. I determine that special conditions of an emergency nature exist that require the use of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (Metropolitan Police force) for Federal purposes, including maintaining law and order in the Nation\u2019s seat of Government; protecting Federal buildings, national monuments, and other Federal property; and ensuring conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the Federal Government. Effective immediately, the Mayor of the District of Columbia (Mayor) shall provide the services of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act.\nSec. 3. Operational Control of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia. (a) The authority of the President conferred by section 740(a) of the Home Rule Act to direct the Mayor with respect to the current special conditions of an emergency nature is delegated to the Attorney General.\n(b) In accordance with section 740(a) of the Home Rule Act, the Mayor shall provide such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the Attorney General may deem necessary and appropriate.\nSec. 4. Monitoring and Recommendations. (a) The Attorney General shall monitor and regularly consult with any senior official the Attorney General deems appropriate on the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of Columbia that require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes.\n(b) The Attorney General shall regularly update me on the status of the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of Columbia that require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes.\n(c) The Attorney General shall inform me of any circumstances that, in the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President or that the action in this order is no longer necessary.\nSec. 5. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nSec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n(d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Justice.\nDONALD J. TRUMP\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nAugust 11, 2025."

      "text": "Memorandum for THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE\nSUBJECT: Restoring Law and Order in the District of Columbia\nSection 1. Background. As President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the District of Columbia National Guard, it is my solemn duty to protect law-abiding citizens from the destructive forces of criminal activity. That obligation applies with special force in our Nation\u2019s capital, where, as Commander in Chief of the District of Columbia National Guard, I must also ensure that all citizens can avail themselves of the right to interact with their elected representatives, and that the Federal Government can properly function, without fear of being subjected to violent, menacing street crime.\nThe local government of the District of Columbia has lost control of public order and safety in the city, as evidenced by the two embassy staffers who were murdered in May, the Congressional intern who was fatally shot a short distance from the White House in June, and the Administration staffer who was mercilessly beaten by a violent mob days ago. Citizens, tourists, and staff alike are unable to live peacefully in the Nation\u2019s capital, which is under siege from violent crime. It is a point of national disgrace that Washington, D.C., has a violent crime rate that is higher than some of the most dangerous places in the world. It is my duty to our citizens and Federal workers to secure the safety and the peaceful functioning of our Nation, the Federal Government, and our city.\nSec. 2. Mobilizing the District of Columbia National Guard. Pursuant to my authority under the Constitution and laws of the United States and the District of Columbia, I direct the Secretary of Defense to mobilize the District of Columbia National Guard and order members to active service, in such numbers as he deems necessary, to address the epidemic of crime in our Nation\u2019s capital. The mobilization and duration of duty shall remain in effect until I determine that conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia. Further, I direct the Secretary of Defense to coordinate with State Governors and authorize the orders of any additional members of the National Guard to active service, as he deems necessary and appropriate, to augment this mission.\nSec. 3.

      "text": "Appeals court questions judges' ability to review Trump's LA National Guard deployment\nA group of appellate court judges is pondering what role the courts should play in determining whether President Donald Trump can keep control of the National Guard to protect immigration enforcement agents and suppress protesters in Los Angeles.\nTrump ordered 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles following protests over the raids by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit heard arguments on June 17 on whether to continue Trump's mobilization of the troops.\nIt comes less than a week after U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer granted California Gov. Gavin Newsom a temporary restraining order, which would have blocked Trump's deployment of the California National Guard and returned control of the troops to Newsom. The governor, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, and other leaders repeatedly claimed that Trump inflamed the protests by sending in the military when it wasn't necessary.\nThe appellate court judges temporarily halted the federal judge's order on June 12.\nOn June 17, the three-judge panel quizzed lawyers from the Trump administration and Newsom on whether they should factor into Trump's decision at all.\nJustice Department lawyer Brett Shumate told the panel that Breyer had \"improperly second-guessed the president's judgment\" about the need to call up the National Guard to protect federal property and personnel from \"mob violence\" in Los Angeles.\n\"There is no role for the court to play in reviewing that decision,\" Shumate said.\nCalifornia's attorney argues troops weren't needed\nDuring the hourlong hearing on June 17, California's attorney, Samuel Harbourt, asked the appeals court to deny the Trump administration's motion. He called the federalization of the National Guard an \"unprecedented, unlawful executive action.\"\nHarbourt argued that the governor doesn't have any problems giving the president \"some sort of deference\" for implementing federal law, but that there's nothing to defer to in the case since Newsom did not consent to the National Guard's activation as typically mandated by law.\n\"There's really nothing to defer to because the president has not, and the defendants have made no attempt whatsoever to provide an argument or evidence that they even contemplated more modest measures to the extreme response in calling in the National Guard and militarizing the situation,\" Harbourt said.\nHarbourt did say that Los Angeles has seen \"certain episodes of unrest and even violence in recent days, including violence directed at state and local law enforcement officials.\" But Harbourt added that local and state law enforcement have \"strongly condemned these acts, and it has responded forcefully to them.\"\nThe attorney urged the judges to remove the National Guard from Los Angeles so that they can return to their regular duties, including responding to emergencies such as wildfires. Harbourt concluded the troops' presence is \"causing harm to our nation's broader democratic tradition of the separation of the military from civilian affairs.\"\nThe hearing came as local organizers vowed to continue protesting against immigration raids, despite demonstrations in downtown Los Angeles having calmed and Bass lifting a curfew in the area.\nTrump's attorneys say the president has 'unreviewable' powers\nMeanwhile, Shumate said the appeals court should indeed grant the request for a stay of the lower court's order. Shumate said the lower court's ruling would have blocked Trump's deployment of the California National Guard and returned control of the troops to Newsom.\nShumate argued that Trump complied with the statute by informing the general in charge of the troops of his decision and that the president does have the authority to call in the National Guard.\nShumate also said before the lower court's ruling that the president\u2019s decisions are not subject to judicial review.\nThe attorney said there is \"documented record of sustained, ongoing mob violence.\" Shumate told the three-panel judges on June 17 that on June 6 more than \"1,000 violent protesters\" had been outside a federal building that required the National Guard.\n\"They were essential to protecting that building,\" Shumate said.\nShumate then argued to the appeal court judges that Trump has \"unreviewable\" powers as the commander-in-chief to deploy troops for any reason he sees fit.\nHearings show 'interesting paradigm of power'\nThe three judges, who consist of two judicial appointees of Trump and one of former President Joe Biden, did not issue a ruling but seemed to indicate they might keep the current stay in place.\nThe two Trump appointees, Judges Mark J. Bennett and Eric D. Miller, appeared doubtful of the Trump administration's claim that courts can't review Trump's decision to invoke a statute allowing him to activate the National Guard. But they also appeared to lean into the notion that the occasional violent protests were enough to warrant Trump's decision.\nAnd the Biden appointee, U.S. Circuit Judge Jennifer Sung, had some doubts about the case made by Harbourt, Newsom's attorney.\nBennett suggested that the court could act before a hearing that Breyer has scheduled in the case for June 20.\nThe arguments in court is another episode in \"an interesting paradigm of power,\" between Trump and Newsom as the governor is trying to assert his role as a major leader in America's most populous state that also has the world's fourth-largest economy, said Brian Sobel, a longtime political analyst based in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\"Newsom is trying to establish with people that he\u2019s a national player, that he\u2019s presidential-worthy because he\u2019s willing to take Trump on,\" Sobel told USA TODAY. \"He\u2019s choosing battles where he can have similar stature as the president, where he can assert his power and appear almost like a co-equal.\"\nHearing takes place as LA protests have simmered, curfew lifted\nLos Angeles police have said that more than 500 arrests have been made related to protest activity since June 7. The June 17 appeals court hearing comes as the Los Angeles mayor announced that she lifted the city's curfew.\n\"The curfew, coupled with ongoing crime prevention efforts, have been largely successful in protecting stores, restaurants, businesses and residential communities from bad actors who do not care about the immigrant community,\" Bass said in a statement. \"I am lifting the curfew effective today, and as we continue quickly adapting to chaos coming from Washington, and I will be prepared to reissue a curfew if needed. My priority will continue to be ensuring safety, stability and support in the downtown neighborhoods.\"\nLAPD 'will maintain a strong presence'\nLos Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said this week that his department was \"not letting our guard down\" with the then-adjusted curfew hours. McDonnell said the decision showed the progress authorities have made in reducing crime and vandalism within the city's curfew zone.\n\"The curfew has been an effective tool in helping us maintain public safety in the downtown Los Angeles area and deter those looking to exploit peaceful protests for criminal activity,\" McDonnell said in a statement. \"The LAPD will maintain a strong presence in the area and continue to monitor conditions closely to protect lives, uphold the right to lawful assembly, and safeguard property.\"\nBass first announced the six-day curfew on June 10 in a stretch of downtown Los Angeles where the protests have largely taken place, \"to stop the vandalism, to stop the looting.\"\nContributing: Reuters"
