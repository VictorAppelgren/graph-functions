  "content": "JOBE BELLINGHAM'S dad angrily confronted a Dortmund chief outside the dressing room after his superstar son was subbed off at half-time.\n\nThings got heated behind the scenes after Borussia Dortmund\u2019s disappointing 3-3 draw against St. Pauli as Jobe Bellingham's father Mark took matters into his own hands.\n\nAfter the final whistle blew, tensions flared in the tunnel in the aftermath of Dortmund's disappointing draw.\n\nJobe, who moved to Borussia Dortmund for \u00a332million from Sunderland this summer, was subbed off at half-time in the club's opening game of the Bundesliga season.\n\nAnd Dortmund went on to let a 3-1 lead slip by conceding two goals in the closing minutes to drop two points.\n\nEmotions were high by still running high in the tunnel after the whistle.\n\nAccording to Sky Sports in Germany, Mark - who is also Jobe's advisor - was particularly incensed.\n\nHe was reportedly not just angry at the early withdrawal of his son but also by the lacklustre, uninspired performance by his Dortmund team-mates.\n\nThe Bellinghams were waiting for their son but were then escorted into the inner sanctum by security who recognised them.\n\nMark Bellingham was reported to be visibly upset as he had a lengthy exchange with Dortmund\u2019s sporting director Sebastian Kehl.\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS - TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nIt's not uncommon for parents or advisors to visit the locker room area.\n\nHowever reports suggest that this particular showdown didn\u2019t sit well with the club\u2019s hierarchy.\n\nSources close to the situation described it as an uncharacteristic move that has rubbed some up the wrong way.\n\nGerman news outlet BILD revealed Mark Bellingham tried to chat wit Kovac directly \u2013 and 'made no secret of his opinion.'\n\nThe club\u2019s response came swiftly the following day.\n\nThe Germans have now moved to ban all family from the areas around the dressing rooms.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports in Germany, Kehl said: \u201cWe are all disappointed with yesterday\u2019s result.\n\n\"However the area in question is reserved for players, coaches, and management not families or advisors.\n\n\"This won't happen again. We\u2019ve made sure everyone involved is fully aware of this.\u201d\n\nMark Bellingham has yet to comment publicly on the incident.\n\nJobe, who wears the No 7 shirt, has already played for Dortmund at the Club World Cup in America earlier this summer.\n\nBellingham follows in the footsteps of superstar brother Jude who also played for Dortmund.\n\nHe joined the German club on a five-year deal running until 2030 after helping guide Sunderland to the Premier League last season.\n\nIt's thought that the deal could rise up to \u00a332m and includes a 15 per cent sell-on clause for Sunderland.\n\nBellingham, who came through the academy ranks at Birmingham City like his brother, earned his switch off the back of two strong seasons at Sunderland.\n\nHe managed four goals and three assists as the Black Cats finished fourth in the Championship this season, ultimately being promoted via the play-off final.",
