  "content": "A quick-moving wildfire scorched thousands of acres Tuesday and burned homes in a California Gold Rush town settled around 1850 by Chinese miners who were driven out of a nearby camp.\n\nThe fire rapidly grew to 6.25 square miles in size, forcing the evacuation of the Chinese Camp Town and surrounding highways, according to CalFire, the state\u2019s chief fire agency. There were no immediate reports of injuries or deaths, but the fire remained uncontained Tuesday night.\n\nAt least five homes were burning in the rural town, which has a mix of freestanding and mobile homes.\n\nOutside one house on Tuesday evening, seven people quickly moved large tree branches away from the structure and shoveled sand onto the fire in a desperate attempt to keep the blaze from spreading from the house next door. They worked for about 30 minutes until firefighters arrived. An RV on the property was damaged by the fire.\n\nFire officials have requested additional resources such as fire engines, dozers and an aircraft.\n\nThe blaze, known as the 6-5 Fire, was caused by lightning, according to CalFire. It is one of more than a dozen blazes that erupted Tuesday across California, according to CalFire.\n\nThousands of Chinese came to California during the Gold Rush and faced persecution that included an exorbitant Foreign Miners Tax designed to drive them away from mining.\n\nChinese Camp Town, about 57 miles east of Stockton, was settled by Chinese miners after they were driven out of a nearby camp, according to Visit Tuolumne County. Originally called Camp Washington, its name was soon changed to reflect the thousands of people from China who settled there.",

      "text": "(AP) \u2014A wildfire that destroyed four homes in central Oregon was starting to stabilize on Monday, authorities said, while a blaze in Northern California wine country has so far spared some of the state\u2019s most famous vineyards.\nMoisture helped the 1,200 firefighters battling Oregon\u2019s Flat Fire, but more work needed to be done. Dry, hot weather had fueled a rapid expansion of the blaze across 34 square miles of rugged terrain in Deschutes and Jefferson counties since the fire began late Thursday.\n\u201cGotta love Mother Nature. It brought in a little bit of rain. Cooled the temps, relative humidity came up,\u201d Travis Medema, the state\u2019s chief deputy state fire marshal, told a community meeting in the town of Sisters. \u201cThe incident, for the first time in the last three days, is really beginning to stabilize.\u201d\nOfficials said firefighters had protective lines of some sort around the entire fire, including roads, but the fire remained at 5% containment.\nAuthorities at one point ordered evacuations for more than 4,000 homes but lifted orders for some areas in the evening.\nA heat advisory was in place through Wednesday, and forecasters warned that potential thunderstorms could create erratic winds that would challenge firefighters.\nFlames in California\u2019s wine country\nMeanwhile, the Pickett Fire in Northern California has charred about 10 square miles of remote Napa County, known for its hundreds of wineries. It was 15% contained on Monday.\nFlames spared the home and adjacent vineyards of Jayson Woodbridge of Hundred Acre wines, but he said it was a close call on Thursday when the fire broke out and raced along nearby slopes.\nHe and his son grabbed hoses and futilely began spraying down the steep hillsides. \u201cThe water was evaporating as fast as we were spraying it out there,\u201d Woodbridge recalled Monday. \u201cIt was just a hot funnel of air. Fire was just engulfing everything.\u201d\nBefore long, crews with bulldozers and air support arrived to protect the property. Water-dropping helicopters continued their flights on Monday, keeping the flames contained to canyons about 80 miles north of San Francisco.\nWith about a month to go before harvest, Woodbridge said his grapes won\u2019t be damaged because of the \u201cpure luck\u201d of wind direction.\n\u201cThe smoke won\u2019t affect the fruit because the wind\u2019s coming in from the west, thankfully,\u201d Woodbridge said. That wasn\u2019t the case in 2020 when toxic smoke from the Glass Fire caused Woodbridge and other wineries to scrap much of that year\u2019s crop.\nThere have been no reports of damage to any vineyards from the Pickett Fire, said Michelle Novi with Napa Valley Vintners, a nonprofit trade association.\nFirefighting resources have been put in place to protect wineries, especially as winds pick up later in the day, according to the California Department of Forestry & Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.\n\u201cWith the weather over the last 48 hours, we\u2019re seeing high temperatures, low humidity paired with some increasing wind in the late afternoon, which was giving our troops some additional work on the eastern side of this incident,\u201d Cal Fire spokesperson Curtis Rhodes told The Associated Press on Monday.\nA firefighter dies in Montana\nIn southwest Montana, a 60-year-old contract firefighter from Oregon died Sunday afternoon, after suffering a cardiac emergency while battling the Bivens Creek fire.\nRuben Gonzeles Romero was among more than 700 firefighters working on the lightning-caused fire in the Tobacco Root Mountains about 15 miles north of Virginia City, Montana.\nThe Bivens Creek fire has burned approximately 3 1/2 square miles since Aug. 13 in a remote area with thick timber and numerous dead trees.\nHeat wave complicates the firefighting efforts\nResidents of the western United States have been sweltering in a heat wave that hospitalized some people, with temperatures hitting dangerous levels throughout the weekend in Washington, Oregon, Southern California, Nevada and Arizona.\nAfter a weekend of triple-digit temperatures, authorities in Multnomah County, Oregon, said they were investigating the death of a 56-year-old man as possibly heat-related.\nThe area of the Oregon fire is in a high desert climate, where dried grasses and juniper trees are burning and fire is racing through tinder-dry canyon areas where it\u2019s challenging to create containment lines, said Deschutes County sheriff\u2019s spokesperson Jason Carr.\nIn central California, the state\u2019s largest blaze this year, the Gifford Fire, was at 95% containment Monday after charring nearly 206 square miles of dry brush in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties since erupting on Aug. 1. The cause is under investigation.\nAlthough it\u2019s difficult to directly tie a single fire or weather event directly to climate change, scientists say human-caused warming from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas is causing more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires."
