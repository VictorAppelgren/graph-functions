      "feedback": "Strong start linking macro AI capex, policy risk, and cash-flow ballast, but the analysis lacks a crisp causal map, explicit timing, and quantitative guardrails; to reach world-class quality, rewrite as a tight 3–6 month catalyst map with clearly defined triggers, invalidations, and sequencing, anchored in the cited data (STBVARD8F; WTNT85IPR; U3ZK13ZQI; YX2J8NHZ1; 4661GWFP7). Actionable edits and specifics:\n- Build a transparent causal chain: AI infrastructure demand drives compute/network/security orders (STBVARD8F), which supports data-center energy usage growth (~945 TWh by 2030) and capex by OEMs and tech infra players (WTNT85IPR); Coca-Cola’s 6.7% of sales Global Ventures and 3% coffee-volume drag imply lower near-term growth into cash-flow durability and dividends (STBVARD8F); Disney’s shift from fixed early-entry perks to Lightning Lane signals higher-margin, on-demand experiences, informing consumer-finance/inflation hedges (U3ZK13ZQI). Tie these to explicit portfolio implications: lean into value/quality with dividend anchors (KO, PG, TI) and cyclical upside from U.S. capex (GM). \n- Quantify with the numbers that matter: Costa Coffee sale around £2B vs 2018 £3.9B purchase; Costa 2023 revenue £1.22B; Coca-Cola 2024 Global Ventures $3.13B (6.7% of sales); KO forward yield ~2.89% with 21.7x cash-flow context; TI as 21-year dividend raiser with ~2.7% yield; MAA 4.3% yield; SHW ~0.9% yield; GM capex envelope $10–12B annually through 2027; 25% tariffs on imported vehicles/parts with potential macro import-price effects (STBVARD8F; WTNT85IPR;  YX2J8NHZ1). Present sensitivity: base-case sector tilts toward low-vol/value ETFs (IUSV) and durable-dividend names; include exact target yields/val-cores from KO, PG, TI, AXP, SBUX per YX2J8NHZ1.\n- Formalize timing windows and path-dependency: Tariff policy decision timing (near-term, with 25% tariff baseline) and GM’s 2025–2027 capex cadence; Disney/KO/ Costa sale milestones (Costa sale talks underway; last Costa-related data point; Disney’s Jan 5, 2026 change date) to anchor 1–2 quarter windows; AI-30 list developments (additions/removals) to calibrate ongoing AI-cycle backbone (STBVARD8F; 4661GWFP7). Include invalidation signals: tariff escalation beyond 25% or faster-than-expected easing; Costa sale fails to materialize; GM capex/battery/EV announcements disappoint; KO/PG/TI dividend cuts or payout-at-risk signals.\n- Sharpen alts and risk signals: Alt 1—tariff relief or macro stabilization accelerates cyclicals; Alt 2—prolonged M&A slowdown and higher capex discipline sustains risk-off in growth names; Alt 3—AI demand disappoints (data-center energy or cooling constraints) or a sharper consumer slowdown; each alt should tie to a 1–2 quarter price-path and explicit watch signals (Nvidia/AI earnings trajectory; GM domestic output trajectory; Costa/Disney event readings; IUSV relative performance as a growth/value barometer) (STBVARD8F; WTNT85IPR; 4661GWFP7; U3ZK13ZQI; YX2J8NHZ1).\n- Tighten structure and citations: keep to IDs only; map each assertion to a source, e.g., KO/PG/TI dividend framework from YX2J8NHZ1 and KO stock metrics from Scraped Source 2; ETF/value framing from 4661GWFP7; Disney/Costa/MA disclosures from U3ZK13ZQI; GM capex and tariff context from WTNT85IPR; AI/energy data from STBVARD8F; reconcile any conflicting signals by stating the preferred weighting under your base case.\n\nOverall, produce a revised draft that (1) shows an explicit 3–6 month catalyst map with timing windows (and invalidations), (2) links macro/policy to sector and stock theses with concrete numbers, (3) offers two clear alts plus a base case with measurable watch-list signals and (4) ends with a concise, defendable confidence level.",
