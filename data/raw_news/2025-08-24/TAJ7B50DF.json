The award was presented to Musaad AlDossar, CEO of Team Falcons, by HRH Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, Crown Prince and Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia, with international icon Cristiano Ronaldo delivering the trophy to the stage in a memorable Closing Ceremony. After seven weeks of fierce competition that came down to the final weekend of play, Team Falcons amassed 5,200 points across 22 tournaments, including victories in Overwatch 2 and top finishes in Dota 2, Chess, PUBG BATTLEGROUNDS, Rocket League and Counter-Strike 2. Team Liquid (4,200 points), Team Vitality (4,050 points), Twisted Minds (3,200 points) and Virtus.pro (3,200 points) rounded out the top five of the final Club Championship ranking. Heading into the final two weeks of competition, seven Clubs were still in contention, as only 1500 points separated 1st and 7th place. The race narrowed to five contenders after Week 6, and Team Falcons sealed the Club Championship in Week 7 when Team Liquid's Street Fighter 6 player Alan \"Nephew\" Sun was eliminated, ending Team Liquid's hopes of overtaking them. HRH Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud, Chairman of the Saudi Esports Federation said: \"With the unwavering support of our leadership and the continuous guidance from His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, Crown Prince and Prime Minister, the Esports World Cup has once again showcased the transformative impact of esports and the pivotal role this industry now plays in cultures and societies across the globe.

From players chasing their dreams to Clubs building sustainable futures, from publishers reaching new audiences to fans rallying on a global stage, the EWC is delivering real impact. Team Falcons embodied that spirit with consistency and fire across so many titles. After just two years, the Esports World Cup is no longer a bold idea; it's the foundation of a global sport. And in 2026, we'll take it even further, together.\" Faisal Bin Homran, Chief Product Officer at the Esports World Cup Foundation said: \"The Esports World Cup 2025 has been nothing short of extraordinary, and the Club Championship finale this past weekend provided a thrilling conclusion to an unforgettable event.
