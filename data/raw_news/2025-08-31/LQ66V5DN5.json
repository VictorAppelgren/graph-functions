  "content": "Australia and Nauru signed an agreement on Friday to allow the Australian government to deport formerly detained people without valid visas to the tiny island nation, the Australian Associated Press reported.\n\nUnder the memorandum of understanding, Australia will pay Nauru 408 million Australian dollars ($267 million) up front once the first people arrive, followed by 70 million Australian dollars ($46 million) annually for the resettlement.\n\nThe move is being slammed by refugee advocates, some of whom say the deal could open the door to mass deportations without notice. Human rights organizations have protested deportations to Nauru since a report by the United Nations found \u201csystematic violations\u201d of the International Convention Against Torture.\n\nTony Burke, Australia's home affairs minister, said in a statement that the memorandum \u201ccontains undertakings for the proper treatment and long-term residence of people who have no legal right to stay in Australia, to be received in Nauru.\"\n\nThe two countries struck a deal in February to allow Australia to deport three violent criminals to Nauru. They were granted 30-year visas.\n\nAn Australian High Court decision in 2023 overturned the government\u2019s policy of indefinite detention for immigrants who could neither get a visa, in some cases because of criminal conduct, nor be deported because they would face persecution or harm in their home countries. More than 200 immigrants have been released from detention as a result of the case. Some were charged with further offenses after their release.\n\nBurke said the Nauru deal would target this group.\n\n\"Anyone who doesn\u2019t have a valid visa should leave the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a fundamental element of a functioning visa system.\u201d\n\nIn a statement posted online, Jana Favero, deputy CEO of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, criticized the agreement.\n\n\u201cThis deal is discriminatory, disgraceful and dangerous,\u201d she said. \"At a time when the entire country has just voted for unity and rejected fear, rather than embrace this and show leadership, the Albanese Government has launched yet another attack on migrants and refugees.\u201d",
