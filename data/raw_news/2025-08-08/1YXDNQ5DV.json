  "content": "Pinterest CEO Bill Ready said Friday (Aug. 8) that it will be some time before consumers are ready to let artificial intelligence (AI) agents do their shopping for them, but that Pinterest is providing AI-powered tools that will \u201cmeet the user where they are\u201d in the meantime.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nSpeaking during the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call, and responding to an analyst\u2019s question about how agentic AI may impact the search funnel, Ready said that in terms of AI agents buying things without the customer being involved, it\u2019s going to be \u201ca very, very long cycle for that to play out\u201d because customers will have to get used to that idea.\n\n\u201cBut if we look at what\u2019s happening on our platform already, we\u2019re able to take the user much further down that shopping journey assisting them,\u201d Ready said, according to the company\u2019s transcript of the call.\n\nReady said Pinterest has \u201creally made AI central to everything that we\u2019re doing.\u201d He pointed to the platform\u2019s ability to make recommendations that align with each user\u2019s taste and style, to effectively curate products for users based on very small signals, and to save users some of the time and work that goes into the shopping journey.\n\n\u201cWe see really great early signs of that,\u201d Ready said. \u201cAnd we think there\u2019s a lot more that we\u2019re going to be able to do there that we will focus on in a very user-centric way that meets the user where they are, but with AI and LLMs (large language models) and agentic capabilities deeply embedded in the way that we\u2019re doing that.\u201d\n\nThe company aims to use generative AI to keep discovery joyful and make shopping frictionless, Pinterest Vice President of Design Dana Cho told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster in an interview posted in May.\n\n\u201cTechnology has nailed the buying part,\u201d Cho said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re bringing the joy back to shopping.\u201d\n\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence and Fiserv collaboration \u201cGenAI Applications in Retail Transaction Analysis: Industry Trends and Insights\u201d found that retailers are rapidly adopting Gen AI to enhance customer personalization.\n\nFifty-four percent of retailers used the technology to analyze transaction and payments data for customer segmentation in the last year, according to the report.",

      "text": "More specifically, generative AI is helping visual search understand, classify and recommend the billions of images consumers browse every day, even when they can\u2019t describe what they\u2019re looking for in words.\nThat challenge matters most to platforms built on pictures, and few know that better than Pinterest. The company\u2019s 570 million monthly active user base arrives first to browse and later to buy.\nLast month, Pinterest rolled out global \u201cAI-modified\u201d labels on image Pins, tapping its own classifiers to identify synthetic images and flag them for users in real time. It\u2019s part of a broader push to keep inspiration trustworthy as the volume of AI-generated content accelerates.\nThe moves, as well as and the broader future of visual search, were the focus of a conversation between Pinterest Vice President of Design Dana Cho and PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. Their discussion offered a window into how a design-driven social network is rewriting its search grammar for the generative AI age.\n\u201cGenAI makes everything interesting \u2014 and easier, in some ways,\u201d Cho told Webster. \u201cBut the \u2018why\u2019 behind what grabs you in an image is still hard to define.\u201d\nUnlike keyword search engines that match words to indexed pages, Pinterest\u2019s new visual search relies on a multimodal foundation model that digests pixels, metadata and user behavior in tandem. Users can long-press any Pin, zoom into a detail, whether it\u2019s a hemline, a brass sconce or the gauzy vibe of a French-girl patio, and watch the platform present similar or adjacent options. Attribute chips such as \u201cearth tones\u201d or \u201cathleisure\u201d appear automatically, giving shoppers language they may not have at hand.\nFor Cho, the advance is less about precision than about what Webster called \u201cguided serendipity.\u201d\n\u201cThere are image search engines that give you a near-duplicate,\u201d Cho said. \u201cWe want to show you it, like it, and slightly adjacent to it \u2014 the rabbit-hole experience users expect from Pinterest.\u201d\nRe-Wiring the Marketplace\nThose rabbit holes have commercial stakes. The same model that spots a boat shoe in a summer shot or the cut of a linen blazer also weighs first-party signals, such as the boards a user builds and the Pins they save, to decide which products, merchants or creators appear next. Cho said the goal is to avoid a one-size-fits-all \u201cpopular feed\u201d and instead surface items that feel \u201cdelightfully personal,\u201d a shift that could nudge Pinterest\u2019s advertising and affiliate businesses deeper into the purchase funnel.\nThat funnel already looks different from a year ago. Pinterest has layered merchant catalogs onto millions of Pins and, under CEO Bill Ready, pushed retailers to upload structured product data so generative AI systems can tell whether the skirt a user loves is actually in stock and in her size. Labeling AI-generated images protects that integrity by warning shoppers when a cottage-core bedroom or avant-garde sneaker may not exist in the physical world, Pinterest executives have said.\nCho said she is cautious about declaring a winner in the emerging contest between text-heavy large language models and image-first platforms.\n\u201cThe future of search is unwritten,\u201d she told Webster, adding that agentic AI could redraw user expectations overnight. Visual search is \u201cespecially unwritten\u201d because most rivals still lean on words, not pixels, to parse intent.\nThe subtext: Pinterest is fighting on two fronts. The first is against general-purpose search giants racing to add imagery to their models, and the second is against niche generative AI startups that generate pictures from text instead of finding them. Pinterest\u2019s years of curating user-saved images give it an edge because the data is both visual and taste-signaling, Cho said.\n\u201cA Pin is a declaration of intent,\u201d she said. \u201cThat makes the training corpus unusually rich.\u201d\nMeasuring Success\nWhere Pinterest once stopped at inspiration, Cho\u2019s team now measures success by whether a user can move from \u201cI like that aesthetic\u201d to \u201cI bought it\u201d without leaving the app. Generative AI\u2019s ability to label, localize and group look-alike products is central to that ambition.\n\u201cPeople slow down and take their time,\u201d she said, especially younger shoppers for whom consideration is part of the fun.\nThe new flow lets them refine a Pin down to a colorway or price point, then click straight to check out on a merchant site or, increasingly, within Pinterest itself.\nWebster pressed Cho on how far Pinterest intends to travel down the commerce stack. Will it become a merchant of record or stick to discovery and referral fees? Cho demurred on specifics but said the company\u2019s mandate is to \u201ccollapse the distance between \u2018love it\u2019 and \u2018own it.\u2019\u201d\nFashion was the obvious test bed. Apparel and accessories already sit atop Pinterest\u2019s most-searched categories, giving engineers an ocean of labeled data and users a low-stakes place to experiment. The company\u2019s new visual language model, which was released first for women\u2019s fashion in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, generates descriptive terms on the fly, helping users articulate the cut of a jacket or the feel of \u201ccoastal granddaughter\u201d even if they never type the phrase, she said.\n\u201cPinterest is where people come to develop their own style sensibility,\u201d Cho said. Moments of life change \u2014 a first job, a wedding, a move \u2014 drive surges in search volume, and visual search \u201clets them find what they\u2019re looking for even when they don\u2019t have the words.\u201d\nThe Next Chapter\nAsked by Webster for a take on the future of Pinterest and generative AI, Cho pointed to the same dual mandate: keep discovery joyful and make shopping frictionless.\n\u201cTechnology has nailed the buying part,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re bringing the joy back to shopping.\u201d\nThat could mean deeper integrations between generative AI labeling, personalized recommendations and in-app checkout \u2014 advances designed to ensure that the platform where trends begin is also where transactions end.\nFor now, the roadmap remains fluid. Pinterest will expand its visual language model to home d\u00e9cor later this year and then to food and travel, categories where images often spark aspiration before words do. If Cho\u2019s vision holds, tomorrow\u2019s consumer may simply point a phone at an outfit, whisper, \u201cShow me something like that,\u201d and let a generative AI-powered Pinterest do the rest.\nIt\u2019s proof, perhaps, that in visual search, a picture is worth 1,000 keywords.\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter."
