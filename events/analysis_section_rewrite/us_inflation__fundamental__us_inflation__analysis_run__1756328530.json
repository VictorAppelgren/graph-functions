      "feedback": "Your draft is a good starting point but it reads more like a news‑brief mash‑up than a rigorous, multi‑year structural analysis. Re‑frame it around the three first‑principles anchors you promised: (1) real‑rate differentials (use the Fed’s 4.25‑4.5% range and the implied real‑rate gap to Brazil’s 5‑6% inflation‑adjusted rate, citing J54PXL0NV for the 97 Mt export figure); (2) terms‑of‑trade/commodity supply shock (quote the 69 % deforestation drop and the 344 % soy expansion, J54PXL0NV, and link to the 2024 soy price trend); and (3) policy reaction functions (explicitly model the Fed’s dovish stance as a “squeezing” real‑rate function that will likely persist through the September meeting, citing OGK8WLL69 for the crypto rally). Structure the piece into clear regimes—Fed‑policy regime, soy‑supply regime, AI‑displacement regime—and spell out the transition conditions (e.g., Fed rate hike, moratorium rollback, AI job‑loss acceleration). Add concrete numbers: crypto price ranges (ETH $4,800–$5,200, BTC $110k–$125k), soy price (≈$10–$12/mt), and Fed policy signals. Replace vague phrases like “high risk‑premium environment” with a causal chain: lower real rates → higher risk‑aversion → capital inflows → crypto/commodity price lift. Cite each claim with the source ID (e.g., J54PXL0NV, OGK8WLL69, 1GVYF2V8O). Conclude with a concise base case, key risks (Fed hike, moratorium rollback, rapid AI displacement), what to watch (Fed minutes, Brazilian export data, AI adoption metrics), and a confidence rating (e.g., moderate). This will satisfy the depth, clarity, and citation density requirements.",
