  "content": "Investing.com -- Xpeng shares rose 0.7% in premarket trading Thursday after the electric vehicle maker unveiled its next-generation P7 sedan, which Jefferies called \u201canother game changer.\u201d\n\nJefferies analysts, who attended the launch event, described the new model as \u201ca high-performance sports sedan with exceptional handling, capable of accelerating from 0 to 100 km/h in just 3.7s,\u201d with \u201ca more avant-garde and aggressive design language.\u201d\n\nThe vehicle is longer and wider than the current P7, but lower, giving it \u201ca wide-body, low-slung stance that accentuates its coupe-like dynamism.\u201d\n\nJefferies noted that more than 10,000 refundable pre-orders were placed within 6 minutes and 37 seconds of the presale opening, despite pricing yet to be announced.\n\nThe firm estimates a price of about RMB250,000.\n\nThe car comes standard with an 800V SiC platform, a 5C ultra-fast charging battery offering a range of up to 820 km, and an 87-inch AD-HUD. It also includes a 1.84m\u00b2 triple-layer silver-coated glass roof for heat and UV protection.\n\nJefferies highlighted the model\u2019s use of three self-developed Turing AI chips delivering 2,250 TOPS in computing power.\n\n\u201cThe accelerated deployment of Turing chips will help improve XPeng\u2019s vehicle margin, in our view,\u201d stated Jefferies.\n\nThe firm expects monthly sales of the Next P7 to reach 6,000 units, above consensus forecasts of 4,000, and total company deliveries to hit 40,000 by September.\n\nJefferies reiterated Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) as its \u201ctop pick OEM,\u201d noting the company is on track to turn its first quarterly profit in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nVictoria's Secret Exposed: The Warning Sign Behind the Stock's 52% Collapse",

      "text": "Eli Lilly shares fall as weight-loss pill study overshadows earnings\nMarkets came roaring back from April lows, ending the first half of 2025 with record highs across the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. But when stocks snap back so quickly, especially with uncertainty still in the air, it raises a key question:\nAre your holdings still backed by strong fundamentals?\nExperienced investors know that sharp recoveries often mask growing risks. That\u2019s why now is a good time to reassess what you\u2019re holding and whether those stocks still deserve a place in your portfolio.\nOne approach gaining traction with investors is using valuation-based signals to cut through the noise. For under $7 a month, members are doing exactly that - they\u2019re tracking a live list of the Most Undervalued and Most Overvalued stocks, updated in real time and grounded in fundamentals. These lists now span global and local markets.\nAlready an InvestingPro member? You can jump straight to the undervalued/overvalued lists by clicking on the links.\nInvestingPro\u2019s Fair Value score blends over 17 professional-grade valuation models into one clean number, giving you institutional-level clarity on every stock you own or watch.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s repeatedly flagged overpriced names before major drawdowns\u2014helping investors exit at the right time and protect profits.\nLet\u2019s take a look at some recent real-world wins from InvestingPro members who followed the \u201cMost Overvalued\u201d signals and sidestepped combined catastrophic losses of 96%+ on two well-known names:\n1. Victoria\u2019s Secret: What Went Wrong After an Impressive Bull Run in 2024?\nVictoria\u2019s Secret (NYSE:VSCO), once a standout performer during the 2024 bull run, saw its fortunes reverse dramatically in the first half of 2025.\nBy the end of June, the stock had dropped 49.32%, wiping out billions in shareholder value in just six months, well beyond the projected downside. While the broader market surged to new all-time highs and staged a textbook V-shaped recovery, VSCO failed to rebound alongside the broader market.\nSo, what happened?\nThe underlying fundamentals failed to support the stock\u2019s earlier momentum. Gross margins kept declining, pressured by rising input costs and increased need for heavy discounting amid fierce competition. Revenue growth also slowed.\nBut this decline didn\u2019t come out of nowhere.\nAs early as December 1, 2024, the InvestingPro Fair Value model had flagged VSCO as significantly overvalued, with a projected downside risk of 40.26%.\nWhile the stock climbed to $48.73 around the time the S&P 500 crossed the 6,000 mark, the Fair Value model had already detected the disconnect between price and fundamentals.\nBy the end of June 2025, the stock had booked losses of almost 50%.\nThis highlights a key lesson for long-term investors: price action alone rarely tells the full story. Valuation tools like Fair Value can help detect early warning signs early on, saving investors from a big portfolio drawdown.\n2. Trump Media: The Trump Trade That Didn\u2019t Work Out (47% Wipeout)\nTrump Media (NASDAQ:DJT) offers a textbook example of the kind of hype-driven stock investors should approach with caution\u2014especially when markets are trading near all-time highs.\nBack in December 2024, as speculation around Donald Trump\u2019s potential return to the White House intensified, DJT shares surged to $33.70. But while headlines drove public excitement, InvestingPro\u2019s Fair Value model told a very different story.\nEven then, our model flagged DJT as significantly overvalued\u2014highlighting nearly 50% downside risk. And just six months later, that risk materialized: by the end of June 2025, the stock had fallen 46.63% from its peak.\nThe Fair Value model had already detected the warning signs\u2014rising losses, declining revenue, extreme volatility, and uncertainty around the company\u2019s long-term growth. Even high-profile buybacks and a large cash reserve weren\u2019t enough to offset investor concerns about profitability and business sustainability.\nSo what can investors learn from DJT\u2019s trajectory?\nHigh-profile names can still pose a high risk. Evaluating the underlying financial health and valuation\u2014as InvestingPro\u2019s Fair Value model does\u2014is key to making smarter, more disciplined investment decisions.\nConclusion\nHistory has repeatedly shown that chasing momentum\u2014without regard for fundamentals\u2014can lead to big portfolio drawdowns.\nWhether it\u2019s a stock trading far above its intrinsic value like Victoria\u2019s Secret, or one driven purely by headlines like Trump Media, tools like Fair Value can help investors cut through the noise and spot what\u2019s hype and what isn\u2019t.\nBuilt on 17+ trusted valuation models, it flags overpriced and underpriced Wall Street darlings and also highlights overlooked opportunities across global markets.\nSo, with correction risks on the rise, now is the perfect time to scan your portfolio holdings for overpriced names."
