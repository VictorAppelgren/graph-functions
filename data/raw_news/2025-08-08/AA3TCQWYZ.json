  "content": "The 34-year-old lefty played 12 seasons in the big leagues, made one All-Star appearance and won one World Series.\n\nWood made his retirement official in a heartfelt Instagram post.\n\n\u201cFor over half my life, every decision I\u2019ve made has centered around how it would impact my baseball career,\u201d Wood wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve given every ounce of myself in pursuit of my lifelong dream of becoming a big leaguer. Playing 12 years in the show, reaching 7 postseasons, winning a World Series, and earning an All-Star selection \u2014 I never could\u2019ve imagined it would turn out this way.\u201d\n\nAfter a collegiate career at Georgia, Wood stayed local after being drafted by the Braves in the second round in 2012. He then made his debut for Atlanta in 2013 at 22 years old.\n\nWood posted a superb 3.10 ERA across 86 games with the Braves before being traded to Los Angeles, where he\u2019d spend the next four seasons (2015-18) with the Dodgers.\n\nIn 2017, he made 25 starts for Los Angeles, posted a career-best 2.72 ERA and got his only All-Star nod of his career.\n\nWood spent 2019 with the Reds before returning to the Dodgers in 2020 and winning the World Series, pitching four innings in the Fall Classic and allowing no runs.\n\nHe joined the Giants at 30 years old and spent three solid seasons there before finishing his career with the Athletics in 2024.\n\n\u201cTo the Braves, Dodgers, Reds, Giants and Athletics \u2014 and your incredible fans \u2014 THANK YOU,\u201d Wood wrote. \u201cPlaying for five iconic franchises and becoming part of those communities is something my family and I will always cherish.\u201d\n\nWood also penned his emotional gratitude for his teammates, coaches, wife, parents, sons and his agency.\n\n\u201cBaseball was my first love. Outside of God and my family, nothing else has shaped me the way this game has,\u201d he added. \u201cEven writing this, I can\u2019t help but smile thinking about how much I still love the game after all this time.\n\n\u201cTo everyone who helped make this dream a reality that I couldn\u2019t begin to list \u2014 if you think this is about you \u2014 IT IS. I love you and thank you. Cheers to what\u2019s next. See you at the park!\u201d",

      "text": "Two and a half decades later, Roger Clemens\u2019 broken bat throw at Mike Piazza is still a defining moment of the Subway Series rivalry.\nWhile many were outraged and confused when Clemens took a chunk of Piazza\u2019s broken bat and fired it into the ground right back at him, Clemens has set the record straight numerous times over the years and did so once again on the latest episode of Jack Curry\u2019s \u201cYankees News & Views\u201d podcast.\n\u201cTV made it look like it was five feet from him,\u201d Clemens said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was that close to the guy, and I definitely wasn\u2019t throwing it at him. I tease people now \u2026 if I wanted to hit him with it, I could have hit him with it.\u201d\nClemens detailed that the reason he fielded the bat in the first place was because his initial instinct was that the baseball was coming back at him.\n\u201cSo, I broke down into my wonderful fielding position, and wouldn\u2019t ya know, that bat took two hops, came right up into my freaking lap, and I just grabbed it and whistled it on down to the on-deck circle,\u201d he said.\nOf course, this led to mayhem as the benches cleared.\nWhile the broken bat and the ensuing chaos weren\u2019t part of the plan, the fastball that shattered Piazza\u2019s bat was.\n\u201cMike got in the box and I think my first three pitches were like 98, 98, 98. And I shattered his bat,\u201d Clemens said. \u201cThe scouting report with [Yankees pitching coach] Mel Stottlemyre was great, too. We were in the trainer\u2019s room going through the lineup, and when we got to Piazza, we said, \u2018We\u2019re gonna pitch him in. And we\u2019re gonna pitch him in. And we\u2019re gonna pitch him in.\u2019\u201d\nThe Yankees pitcher went on to retire Piazza with a ground ball out, and the Pinstripes took down the Mets 6-5 en route to their 4-1 2000 World Series win."

      "text": "A new video shows ex-NFL star Terrell Suggs brandishing a gun before he was arrested in April 2024 following an incident at a Starbucks in Arizona the month prior.\nThe video, published Friday by TMZ, shows the full altercation between Suggs and a man at the Starbucks drive-through, ending with Suggs dangling a gun out of his car\u2019s window before driving away.\nThe incident began when the man alleged that Suggs backed his car up and hit his vehicle in an effort to get closer to the Starbucks intercom.\n\u201cYou just backed into me, man,\u201d the man said, with Suggs responding: \u201cBack the f\u2013k up.\u201d\nAfter some more back-and-forth, the man got out of his car and walked over to Suggs\u2019 vehicle, with the former Ravens star stepping outside to confront him.\nSuggs went on to insist that he did not hit the man\u2019s car before the two men got back into their respective vehicles.\nSuggs then picked up his order from the drive-through window and flipped the bird at the man through his car window as he started driving away.\nAfter some more jawing between the two men from their respective cars, Suggs asked, \u201cDo you want to go?\u201d multiple times before adding, \u201cI\u2019ll kill your b\u2013ch ass.\u201d\nThen, as he began driving out of the drive-through line, Suggs held the gun out of his window, staring back at the man.\nAfter an investigation, Maricopa County Police arrested Suggs and the 42-year-old was charged with one count of threatening or intimidating and one count of disorderly conduct.\nSuggs pleaded guilty to the disorderly conduct charge in February and was sentenced to 18 months of supervised probation.\nA rep for Suggs issued a statement to TMZ in the wake of the footage being released.\n\u201cThere was an incident at a Starbucks drive-through in which Terrell attempted to safely back out of the lane when the individual behind him became hostile and falsely accused Terrell of making contact with his vehicle, which did not occur,\u201d Denise White told TMZ.\n\u201cThe situation escalated when the individual exited his car and approached Terrell in a confrontational manner. Notably, the individual had not placed an order in the Starbucks line, which led Terrell to believe he might continue to follow him, causing Terrell to feel threatened.\u201d\nWhite added that \u201cat no point\u201d did her client \u201cpoint a firearm at the individual, but that Suggs \u201cmade it clear that he was prepared to protect himself if necessary. Arizona is an open carry state, and Terrell is aware of the responsibilities that come with firearm ownership. He recognizes that he should not have displayed his weapon, but his actions were solely in response to feeling threatened and were not intended to escalate the situation further.\u201d\nSuggs, who was an outside linebacker, is widely considered one of the best Ravens of all time.\nHe spent 16 of his 17 NFL seasons in Baltimore, earning seven Pro-Bowl selections and one All-Pro nod.\nThe Arizona State product also won the Super Bowl with Baltimore in 2012 and captured a second ring with the Chiefs in 2019."
