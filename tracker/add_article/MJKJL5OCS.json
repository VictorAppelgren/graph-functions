      "summary": "Russia and China have signed a legally binding memorandum to build a new 6,700‑km gas pipeline through Mongolia, the Power of Siberia 2, which will carry up to 50 billion cubic metres of gas per year to China. The project is expected to lower transport costs and offer gas at prices below those for Europe. Existing Power of Siberia deliveries will rise from 38 to 44 billion cubic metres annually. The 30‑year contract, costing tens of billions of dollars, follows heightened Chinese interest amid Middle East tensions and Russia’s loss of European gas markets.",
