      "summary": "Frontline reported Q2 2025 adjusted earnings of $80.4 million ($0.36 per share), up $40 million YoY, driven by higher TCE rates across VLCC, Suezmax and LR2 fleets. The company maintains strong liquidity of $844 million, no debt maturities until 2030, and a fleet of 80 vessels all ECO‑compliant with 55% scrubber‑fitted. Market outlook highlights improved utilization of compliant tankers amid rising compliant oil exports, OPEC production reversals, and a 3 mmbd supply growth forecast, while order books remain tight with newbuilds not expected until 2028. Overall, Frontline’s cash generation potential could rise 64% with a 30% spot market lift, supporting a bullish view on freight rates and fleet profitability.",
