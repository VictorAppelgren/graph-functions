  "content": "On this episode of Stock Movers: - Trade Desk (TTD) analysts are bailing on the one-time market favorite amid growing fears that its advertising technology will get steamrolled by Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s offerings. At least four firms downgraded the stock in the wake of its results and forecast, which crystallized concerns over its growth prospects in a future where Amazon is a more pronounced player. - Sweetgreen (SG) is lower after it slashed its sales guidance after a second straight quarter of disappointing results, highlighting the salad chain\u2019s struggles to sell $15 salads to budget-strained diners. CEO Jonathan Neman said the quarter\u2019s performance reflected macroeconomic challenges and subdued trends in the industry, particularly in several of the company\u2019s biggest urban markets. Sweetgreen is also discontinuing its ripple fries, Neman said, citing the complexity the menu item added to kitchens - Heartflow (HTFL) shares surged 66% after the artificial intelligence software platform focused on heart disease raised $317 million in its initial public offering. Shares of the Mountain View, California-based company traded at $31.49 each on Friday as of 1:01 p.m. in New York, versus an IPO price of $19 apiece. The offering of 16.67 million shares by the company priced above range, after the stock was marketed for $17 to $18 each. The trading gives Heartflow a market value of about $2.6 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings.",
