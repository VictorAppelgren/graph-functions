  "description": "President Donald Trump has taken control of the District of Columbia\u2019s law enforcement and ordered National Guard troops to deploy onto the streets of the nation\u2019s capital",
  "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has taken control of the District of Columbia\u2019s law enforcement and ordered National Guard troops to deploy onto the streets of the nation\u2019s capital, arguing the extraordinary moves are in response to an urgent public safety crisis. Even as district officials questioned the claims underlying his emergency declaration, the president promised a \u201chistoric action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.\u201d His rhetoric echoed that used by conservative politicians going back decades who have denounced American cities, especially those with majority non-white populations or led by progressive politicians, as lawless or crime-ridden and in need of outside intervention.\n\nBut for many residents, the prospect of federal troops surging into the district\u2019s neighborhoods represents an alarming violation of local agency. To some, it echoes uncomfortable historical chapters when politicians used language to paint historically or predominantly Black cities and neighborhoods with racist narratives to shape public opinion and justify aggressive police action.\n\nApril Goggans, a longtime Washington resident and grassroots organizer, said she was not surprised by Trump\u2019s actions. Communities had been preparing for a potential federal crackdown in the district since the summer of 2020, when Trump deployed National Guard troops during racial justice protests after the murder of George Floyd .\n\n\u201cRegardless of where you fall on the political scale, understand that this could be you, your children, your grandmother, your co-worker who are brutalized or have certain rights violated,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe president foreshadowed that if these heavy-handed tactics take root here, they will be rolled out to other majority-Black and Brown cities, like Chicago, Oakland and Baltimore, across the country,\u201d said Monica Hopkins, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s D.C. chapter.\n\nConservative lawmakers have for generations used denigrating language to describe the condition of major American cities and called for greater law enforcement, often in response to changing demographics in those cities driven by nonwhite populations relocating in search of work or safety from racial discrimination and state violence. Republicans have called for greater police crackdowns in cities since at least the 1965 Watts Riots in Los Angeles .\n\nPresident Richard Nixon won the White House in 1968 after campaigning on a \u201claw and order\u201d agenda to appeal to white voters in northern cities alongside overtures to white Southerners as part of his \u201cSouthern Strategy.\u201d Ronald Reagan similarly won both his presidential elections after campaigning heavily on law and order politics. Politicians ranging from former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to former President Bill Clinton have cited the need to tamp down crime as a reason to seize power from cities like Washington for decades.\n\nDistrict of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser called Trump\u2019s takeover of the local police force \u201cunsettling\u201d but not without precedent. The mayor kept a mostly measured tone during a Monday news conference following Trump\u2019s announcement but decried the president\u2019s reasoning as a \u201cso-called emergency\u201d and said the district\u2019s residents \u201cknow that access to our democracy is tenuous.\u201d\n\nTrump threatened to \u201ctake over\u201d and \u201cbeautify\u201d the nation\u2019s capital on the campaign trail and claimed the district was \u201ca nightmare of murder and crime.\u201d He also argued the city was \u201chorribly run\u201d and said his team intended \u201cto take it away from the mayor.\u201d The president repeated comments he\u2019d previously made about some of the nation\u2019s largest cities during his news conference, including Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Oakland, California, and his hometown of New York City. All are currently run by Black mayors.\n\n\u201cYou look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities in a very bad, New York is a problem. And then you have, of course, Baltimore and Oakland. We don\u2019t even mention that anymore. They\u2019re so far gone. We\u2019re not going to let it happen,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president\u2019s rhetoric \u201cpaints a picture that crime is out of control, even when it is not true, then blames the policies of Democratic lawmakers that are reform- and public safety-minded, and then claims that you have to step in and violate people\u2019s rights or demand that reforms be reversed,\u201d Wiley said.",

      "text": "FACT FOCUS: Trump exaggerates, misstates facts on Washington crime\nFACT FOCUS: Trump exaggerates, misstates facts on Washington crime\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Monday that his administration will take over policing the nation\u2019s capital city in what the Republican said is an effort to bring down rising crime rates in Washington, D.C.\nBut Trump exaggerated or misstated many of the facts surrounding public safety in Washington, where the crime rate has fallen in recent years, while leaving out much of the context.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the facts:\nStatistics rebut Trump\u2019s claims about violent crime in Washington\nTRUMP: \u201cIt\u2019s getting worse, not getting better. It\u2019s getting worse.\u201d\nTHE FACTS: Statistics published by Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police contradict the president and show violent crime has dropped in Washington since a post-pandemic peak in 2023.\nAccording to the data, homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. Overall, violent crime is down 26% compared with this time a year ago.\nA recent Department of Justice report shows that violent crime is down 35% since 2023, returning to the previous trend of decreasing crime that puts the district\u2019s violent crime rate at its lowest in 30 years.\nThat report shows that when compared to 2023 numbers, homicides are down 32%, armed carjackings are down 53% and assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 27%.\nThe city\u2019s statistics have come into question, however, after authorities opened an investigation into allegations that officials altered some of the data to make it look better. But Mayor Muriel Bowser stands by the data and said Trump\u2019s portrait of lawlessness is inaccurate.\n\u201cWe are not experiencing a spike in crime,\u201d Bowser said on MSNBC Sunday. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re watching our crime numbers go down.\u201d\nMurders in 2023 in Washington were high, but not the highest ever\nTRUMP: \u201cMurders in 2023 reached the highest rate, probably ever. They say 25 years, but they don\u2019t know what that means because it just goes back 25 years.\u201d\nTHE FACTS: In 2023, the District of Columbia recorded 274 murders in a city of about 700,000, its highest number in 20 years. But the city\u2019s own crime statistics from the 1970s, 80s and 90s, when the population was smaller, show much higher numbers of homicides.\nIn 1990, for instance, the city reported 498 homicides. The next year saw 509, and 460 in 1992.\nDecades of statistics on crime in the city are available online.\nWashington murder rate compared to international capitals\nTRUMP: \u201cThe murder rate in Washington today is higher than that of Bogota, Colombia, Mexico City. Some of the places that you hear about as being the worst places on Earth, much higher. This is much higher.\u201d\nTHE FACTS: It\u2019s true, but Trump isn\u2019t telling the whole story. Washington does have a higher homicide rate than many other global cities, including some that have historically been considered unsafe by many Americans. But Trump is leaving out important context: the U.S. in general sees higher violent crime rates than many other countries.\nWhile Washington is one of America\u2019s most dangerous big cities, others have higher crime rates.\nTrump blames cashless bail for crime without evidence\nTRUMP : \u201cThis dire public safety crisis stems from a public safety crisis that is directly from the abject failures of the city\u2019s local leadership. The radical left City Council adopted no cash bail. By the way, every place in the country where you have no cash bail is a disaster.\u201d\nTHE FACTS: Data has not determined the impact of cashless bail on crime rates. Studies, many of which focus on recidivism of defendants rather than crime rates, have shown mixed results.\nA 2024 report published by the Brennan Center for Justice saw \u201cno statistically significant relationship\u201d between bail reform and crime rates. The nonprofit looked at crime rate data from 2015 through 2021 for 33 cities across the U.S., 22 of which had instituted some type of bail reform. Researchers used a statistical method to determine if crime rates had diverged in those with reforms and those without.\nAmes Grawert, the report\u2019s co-author and senior counsel in the Brennan Center\u2019s Justice Program, said this conclusion \u201cholds true for trends in crime overall or specifically violent crime.\u201d\nSimilarly, a 2023 paper published in the American Economic Journal found no evidence that cash bail helps ensure defendants will show up in court or prevents crime among those who are released while awaiting trial.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any valid studies corroborating the President\u2019s claim and would love to know what the Administration offers in support,\u201d Kellen Funk, a professor at Columbia Law School who studies pretrial procedure and bail bonding, told The Associated Press in a July 25 fact check. \u201cIn my professional judgment I\u2019d call the claim demonstrably false and inflammatory.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has cited a 2022 report from the district attorney\u2019s office in Yolo County, California, that looked at how a temporary cashless bail system implemented across the state to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in courts and jails impacted recidivism. It found that out of 595 individuals released between April 2020 and May 2021 under this system, 70.6% were arrested again after they were released.\nFunk, contacted Monday, noted that Washington D.C. reformed its cash bail system in the 1990s.\n\u201cWhat the President is declaring to be an \u2018emergency\u2019 is a system that has functioned much better than cash-based bail systems for nearly thirty years now, including during the recent historic lows in reported crime in the District,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe D.C. bail system has served as a model for bipartisan bail reform efforts in New Jersey and New Mexico over the past decade.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writer Melissa Goldin in New York contributed reporting.\n___\nFind AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck."

The District of Columbia\u2019s status as a congressionally established federal district gives him a unique opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime.\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on reaction to President Trump\u2019s DC police takeover plan.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi will assume responsibility for Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department, Trump said, as he also railed against potholes and graffiti in the city and called them \u201cembarrassing.\u201d The president did not provide a timeline for the control of the police department, but he\u2019s limited to 30 days under statute unless he gets approval from Congress.\nAs Trump spoke, demonstrators gathered outside the White House to protest his moves. And local officials rejected the Republican president\u2019s depiction of the district as crime-ridden and called his actions illegal.\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s actions are unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful,\u201d District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said. \u201cThere is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia.\u201d\nSchwalb, a Democrat, said violent crime in the district reached historic 30-year lows last year and is down an additional 26% this year.\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser said she would follow the law regarding the \u201cso-called emergency\u201d even as she indicated that Trump\u2019s actions were a reason why the District of Columbia should be a state with legal protections from such actions.\n\u201cWhile this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can\u2019t say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we\u2019re totally surprised,\u201d Bowser said.\nCombating crime\nThe president dismissed the idea Washington needed to enlarge its 3,500-officer police force, even as he seeks to have more armed personnel going through the city with the goal of reducing crime.\n\u201cWhat you need is rules and regulations, and you need the right people to implement them,\u201d he said.\nTrump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act in an executive order to declare a \u201ccrime emergency\u201d so his administration could take over the city\u2019s police force. He signed a directive for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to activate the National Guard.\nWhile Trump has portrayed himself as a friend to law enforcement and enjoyed the political backing from many of their groups, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of the 1,500-plus people charged with crimes in the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, including people convicted of assaulting police officers.\nAbout 500 federal law enforcement officers are being tasked with deploying throughout the nation\u2019s capital as part of Trump\u2019s effort to combat crime, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.\nMore than 100 FBI agents and about 40 agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are among federal personnel being assigned to patrols in Washington, the person briefed on the plans said. The Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Marshals Service are contributing officers.\nThe person was not authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity. The Justice Department didn\u2019t immediately have a comment Monday morning.\nThe National Guard\nBowser, a Democrat, has previously questioned the effectiveness of using the National Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. Superior Court, some of which have been open for years.\nBowser cannot activate the National Guard herself, but she can submit a request to the Pentagon.\n\u201cI just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our Guard,\u201d she said Sunday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d acknowledging it is \u201cthe president\u2019s call about how to deploy the Guard.\u201d\nBowser noted that violent crime in Washington has decreased since a rise in 2023. She stressed during a Monday news conference that she believed Trump\u2019s views of the city were shaped by the \u201cchallenging times\u201d of the coronavirus pandemic, when he faced protests and crime spiked as the country began to recover from the outbreak.\nFocusing on homelessness\nTrump has emphasized the removal of Washington\u2019s homeless population, though it was unclear where the thousands of people would go, and he did not give details at his news conference Monday.\n\u201cThe Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\u201d Trump wrote Sunday in a social media post. \u201cWe will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don\u2019t have to move out. We\u2019re going to put you in jail where you belong.\u201d\nJesse Rabinowitz, a advocate for homeless people, called Trump\u2019s plan \u201cfascist\u201d and a \u201cwaste\u201d of resources. He said the move wasn\u2019t about safety.\n\u201cIt is about power, and it is about fascism and authoritarianism,\u201d said Rabinowitz, the campaign and communication director for the National Homelessness Law Center. \u201cIf Donald Trump wanted to keep D.C. safe, he would fund housing and support. Instead, the Republicans just gutted health care, and they\u2019re passing through a budget that will make homelessness worse. They do not care about helping people.\u201d\nCrime statistics\nPolice statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. Overall, violent crime is down 26% compared with this time a year ago.\nThe president has criticized the district as full of \u201ctents, squalor, filth, and Crime,\u201d and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as the Department of Government Efficiency. Police arrested two 15-year-olds in the attempted carjacking and said they were looking for others.\n\u201cThis has to be the best run place in the country, not the worst run place in the country,\u201d Trump said Wednesday.\nHe called Bowser \u201ca good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.\u201d\nTrump has repeatedly suggested the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities. Doing so would require a repeal of the Home Rule Act of 1973 in Congress, a step Trump said lawyers are examining.\nBowser acknowledged the law allows the president to take more control over the city\u2019s police, but only if certain conditions are met.\n\u201cNone of those conditions exist in our city right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not experiencing a spike in crime. In fact, we\u2019re watching our crime numbers go down.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writers Ashraf Khalil, Alanna Durkin Richer, Nathan Ellgren, Darlene Superville and Michelle L.

      "text": "55 years after riots, Watts section of LA still bears scars\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 There were no fires this time in Watts. There was no looting, no shooting and no National Guard troops patrolling.\nProtesters filled the streets around the country in late May and June following the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, demanding an end to police brutality. There was violence and looting in some places, including Los Angeles, but not in LA\u2019s Watts neighborhood, forever linked to an uprising that broke out in the segregated community 55 years ago and became known as the Watts riots.\nDemonstrators made a point not to go into Watts or other poor neighborhoods this time.\nWatts has never fully recovered from fires that leveled hundreds of buildings or the violence that killed 34 people \u2014 two-thirds of whom were shot by police or National Guard troops. Those who lived through those frightening days and those who grew up in its aftermath are keenly aware of that past and the lessons it taught.\n\u201cPeople have learned from the history to say we\u2019re not going to burn our community,\u201d said state Assemblyman Mike Gipson, who was born in Watts a year after the turmoil. \u201cWe realize our community is not going to be built again.\u201d\nWatts has changed from an exclusively Black neighborhood in the 1960s to one that\u2019s majority Latino. It remains poor, with high unemployment.\nThe uprising started Aug. 11, 1965, in a nearby neighborhood after the drunken driving arrest of a young Black man by a white California Highway Patrol officer. The violence reflected pent-up anger over an abusive police force, a problem that has ebbed but not entirely faded, according to those who live here.\nImprovements over the years include a more diverse Los Angeles Police Department that better reflects the city\u2019s population. One of Watts\u2019 major public housing developments, Jordan Downs, is being rebuilt with a nearby retail shopping complex.\nA government commission that studied the cause of the rebellion called for better police-community relations and more low-income housing, along with better schools, more job training, more efficient public transportation and better health care. While some gains have been made, those who live here say the area has a long way to go to overcome decades of neglect.\nBlack residents, people born here and those who work to make life better in Watts spoke to The Associated Press about the challenges they faced and those that remain.\n___\nDonny Joubert remembers the chaos of 1965 through the eyes of a 5-year-old.\nSmoke filled the air and adults wept in front of a black-and-white TV tuned to images of their community burning and widespread looting.\nWhen he saw National Guard troops walking outside, Joubert thought his plastic toy soldiers had come to life.\n\u201cWhat really shocked me was I look up and I see the same guys I was holding were walking through the development with guns on their shoulders,\u201d Joubert said.\nLike some young men in the area, Joubert joined a gang and ended up in jail.\nBut at 20, and with a young daughter, he got a second chance. Through a program founded by U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters of California he eventually got a job at the Los Angeles Housing Authority, where he\u2019s now a grounds supervisor.\nHe\u2019s also vice president of the Watts Gang Task Force, which meets weekly with police. If there are reports of an abusive officer \u2014 someone roughing people up or prone to stopping cars without cause \u2014 they tell the captain. The officer may get transferred, though Joubert is concerned that just moves the problem to another neighborhood.\nHe wants to see more done to prosecute police for brutality and fatal shootings. Only two officers in Los Angeles County have been prosecuted for on-duty killings in the past 20 years, a period in which close to 900 people, mostly Black and Latino, have been killed by law enforcement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a crooked system when it came to us. They always had a system to keep us locked up, to keep a knee in our neck,\u201d Joubert said. \u201cEvery dirty cop that took a Black life, that took a Latino life without cause, we want them in prison because that\u2019s what they did to us.\u201d\n___\nResidents of Watts are still living with collateral damage from 1965, said the Rev. Marcus Murchinson, who preaches at the Tree of Life Missionary Baptist Church and also runs a charter high school, drug rehab clinics and offers health care.\nMany of the businesses that burned were never rebuilt. A corridor of Black-owned restaurants, clothing stores and bars never rebounded.\nThe area has long been termed a \u201cfood desert\u201d because of a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables and a plethora of fast food restaurants and convenience and liquor stores stocked with booze, junk food and cigarettes. It took 20 years for a supermarket to be built after the uprising.\n\u201cIt was almost an act of punishment when they burned down the grocery store,\u201d Murchinson said of the time it took to get a new one.\nMurchinson, 36, who didn\u2019t grow up in Watts, said the community has survived uprisings in 1965 and 1992 following the acquittal of the officers who beat Rodney King. But surviving is not enough.\n\u201cThe spirit of the people of Watts has not changed. They are still resilient. They are still vibrant,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the root of survival. That is a good and bad thing. When you have the testimony of surviving, you sometimes think that is success and think surviving equates to thriving, and it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nHe said residents still suffer from years of systemic racism in policing, banking and housing. Multiple generations of the same families continue to live in public housing projects and only a small percentage get off government assistance and achieve the dream of owning a home.\n\u201cWhat project is going on there?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe project seems to be to warehouse people and make them comfortable, not competent.\u201d\n___\nLavarn Young, 81, who moved to Watts from Texas in 1946, said she\u2019s seen a lot of good change since the uprising.\nFreeways built nearby make it easier to get around, there\u2019s a light rail stop in the heart of Watts and shopping centers eventually replaced businesses that burned down in 1965.\nBut she said gangs have made the neighborhood more dangerous than it was a half-century ago, even if crime is not as bad as during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and early \u201890s.\nYoung, who was horse race bookie and later worked in special education in schools, lives in her parents\u2019 house, which is lined with family photos.\nOne of her sons lives in the house behind her. He gets by on disability pay after a bullet lodged in his brain when he was shot in the eye. He survived two other shootings, as well.\nYoung has 15 grandchildren and lots of nephews and nieces who are in and out of the house. She doesn\u2019t ask if they are in gangs.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be in a gang, but you\u2019re associated with it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a Blood hood, you\u2019re a Blood. If you\u2019re in a Crip hood, you\u2019re a Crip. It depends where you were born.\u201d\nFences now separate homes on the streets where children once played on one another\u2019s lawns, and bars cover many windows.\n\u201cNow, you hardly know your neighbors,\u201d she said.\n___\nFormer gang member Eric Frierson, 37, lives in Imperial Courts, one of the housing projects he refers to as \u201ctribal institutions\u201d because of the rivalries that divide residents despite sharing \u201cthe same struggle.\u201d\nFrierson laments losing focus on becoming a good athlete and falling prey to the \u201cdistractions.\u201d\n\u201cYou come outside and see the sidewalk stained with blood. It doesn\u2019t go anywhere. Every time you go by it, you see it,\u201d he said.\nHis father was in prison, and Frierson served time for robbery, a felony conviction that prevents him from getting work.\n\u201cI went behind that wall. I continued the trend,\u201d Frierson said.\nHe said he\u2019s not optimistic the current activism will lead to big improvements. But he\u2019s planning to set up some type of club that will provide sorely lacking activities for kids.\nFrierson still sees a lot of good within the walls of the housing projects.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more love in those bricks than they give us credit for,\u201d he said.\n___\nHank Henderson, 62, and his family arrived in Watts from Indianapolis the year before the uprising and has seen the bad and good of the neighborhood. He remembers the fires, shattered windows, burned-out cars and soldiers in the streets.\nHe saw the businesses that never returned: banks, doctor\u2019s offices, a gas station, pharmacies, a dental office, barbershops, a grocery store and cleaners.\nThe neighborhood was rough, but Henderson stayed out of trouble \u2014 his father wouldn\u2019t tolerate it and he played sports. He was a local Golden Gloves champ and trains young boxers today.\nThe Black Lives Matter movement and Floyd\u2019s death have brought attention to abuses Black people have witnessed and suffered for years, though Henderson said that situation has improved since LAPD started listening to their complaints.\n\u201cThe police car says, \u2018To protect and to serve\u2019 but \u2018seek and destroy\u2019 is what they were doing,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cPeople are listening now. They\u2019re realizing what\u2019s been going on all these years.\u201d\nHenderson moved out of Watts about two years after a son, Rayshawn Boyce, was gunned down in 2009. The suspected killer was caught but never charged because witnesses feared for their safety.\n\u201cHere, they got this code. You don\u2019t say nothing,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cThey had witnesses at first but then they backed off. They would have had to move, and where were they going to go?\u201d\nHenderson left the Nickerson Gardens housing project after nearly 50 years, moving to the suburbs about 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to get out of here for years. I just wasn\u2019t ready. A lot of people moved out, but they weren\u2019t ready for the real world,\u201d he said.\n___\nThe divisions in Watts \u2014 the gangs, the different housing projects \u2014 trickle down to children, who grow up aware of the feuds.\n\u201cOur park is surrounded by three different areas,\u201d Benjamin Jackson Jr. said. \u201cCertain kids from our community of Watts can\u2019t get together. We don\u2019t even have a neutral meeting place.\u201d\nJackson grew up in Jordan Downs public housing, a weather-beaten collection of two-story apartment buildings originally built to house steelworkers after World War II. The complex is undergoing a major makeover that will include much-needed retail.\nHe still lives in the project.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to get in one, harder to get out because we\u2019re born in it,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe only time seeing anything different from the projects was me being incarcerated.\u201d\nJackson got in trouble at age 10 and was in an out of lockups much of his life. He was a member of the Grape Street Crips, but now, at 44, he\u2019s older, wiser and \u201cno longer a gangbanger.\u201d\nHe said police used to pick up him and others ostensibly for questioning. On the way to the station, they\u2019d say they had to respond to another call and would drop him in rival turf, all alone.\nThey no longer do that, but he said he\u2019s still harassed despite being a carpenter who hasn\u2019t been on parole or probation in 10 years.\n\u201cThey put me up against a wall. \u2018Let\u2019s jack him up and see if he got any warrants,\u2019\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThey\u2019ll say the music was too loud when I don\u2019t have music playing or spot me with people in the car and will just pull me over.\u201d\nHe said the main goal is to get out of the projects, to give his children a better life with a house and a yard. The oldest of his seven kids, a 24-year-old daughter, has realized that dream and lives in central California.\n\u201cShe ain\u2019t never coming back,\u201d Jackson said.\n___\nOn a small building that backs up to freight train tracks on Compton Avenue, an image of Martin Luther King Jr. is painted on a wall across the word, \u201cDREAM.\u201d\nInside the Shack by the Track, Lorinda Lacy tries to make those letters come to life for Watts residents.\nIn addition to assembling party supplies for a living and serving snacks \u2014 hamburgers, cookies, candy \u2014 she spends a lot of her time and energy helping others.\nLacy, known as Auntie Moee, is one of many in Watts, including nonprofits and charities, who provide for those in need.\nLacy does all her work on a shoestring budget, providing blankets and pillows to the homeless, feeding children who miss out on school lunches during the summer and providing hundreds of free meals each holiday to anyone who\u2019s hungry. She gets contributions, buys food when it\u2019s cheap and gets handouts from churches and food pantries.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to give back but my love,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not rich. I\u2019m poor.\u201d\nLacy said her brother, the rapper Kevin \u201cFlipside\u201d White, was her inspiration and mentor for giving back to the community. White was part of the group OFTB, or Operation from the Bottom, that recorded with Death Row Records and worked on several tracks with the late Tupac Shakur.\nWhite died in a drive-by shooting in 2013.\nLacy, 45, moved out of Watts 20 years ago because she didn\u2019t want her daughters to grow up with the trauma she experienced.\nShe said she she eventually became \u201cimmune\u201d to the violence after stepping over bodies on the way to school and finding out who had been killed the night before or who had their house shot up. As a child, she slept on the floor because of frequent drive-by shootings.\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t every night, it was every other night,\u201d she said.\nEven though she moved out, she hasn\u2019t given up on her old neighborhood, where her mother still lives in the house where Lacy grew up.\nShe\u2019s trying to provide a safe place where people can hang out while she works. Music plays in the background and kids play games outside.\n\u201cAll I\u2019m doing is taking my stand and doing my part,\u201d she said.\n___\nGipson attributes his success partly to hardworking parents \u2014 a father who was a truck driver and a mother who was a domestic worker \u2014 who did not spare him from discipline. They taught him to respect others, and neighbors also looked out for him and told his parents when he was out of line.\nThere was immense pressure to join a gang, and he wanted to be part of one. But Gipson said the leader wouldn\u2019t let him join, partly because he was afraid of Gipson\u2019s mother.\nGipson\u2019s turning point came in middle school when he overcame a speech impediment and low self-esteem and was elected class president.\n\u201cIt was difficult growing up, but not impossible growing up in Watts,\u201d he said.\nInspired by a cousin who worked as a U.S. marshal, Gipson eventually became a police officer in the city of Maywood and then left for a series of jobs working for politicians and unions. He was elected to City Council in Carson in 2005 and state Assembly in 2014 to represent an area that includes Watts.\nHe said the legacy of the Watts riots is something he keeps in mind as he tries to make life better for residents.\n\u201cI would say, even though I didn\u2019t know them in 1965, those people didn\u2019t lose their lives in order for someone to grow up in Watts and not create and make a better place for the next generation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you have seen, my God, even in 2020 where people feel disenfranchised, marginalized, feel like they\u2019ve been pushed aside and left for dead, been invisible, their voices have not been elevated to the point where change is effective.\u201d\nAsked why so much is still needed in Watts, Gipson said change is slow. He cited the millions poured into rebuilding Jordan Downs. A new hospital that serves the area opened five years ago to replace the county-run Martin Luther King Jr. hospital that was closed after patient deaths and shoddy care.\nFloyd\u2019s death inspired Gipson to introduce legislation to ban the use of a controversial neck hold that police officers use to restrain suspects. Floyd was handcuffed on the ground and gasping for air as an officer pressed a knee in his neck for nearly eight minutes.\nGipson also wants to see bias training for police, more people of color hired on the force and an affirmative action ban in the state repealed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the same California we were 55 years ago or the city of Los Angeles 55 years ago. We\u2019re moving forward, we\u2019re bringing people together,\u201d Gipson said. \u201cVoices are saying, \u2018We\u2019ve been mistreated.\u2019 Change is in the air.\u201d"

      "text": "Protests intensify in Los Angeles after Trump deploys hundreds of National Guard troops\nProtests intensify in Los Angeles after Trump deploys hundreds of National Guard troops\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on immigration protests across the U.S.\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Tensions in Los Angeles escalated Sunday as thousands of protesters took to the streets in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s extraordinary deployment of the National Guard, blocking off a major freeway and setting self-driving cars on fire as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets, and flash bangs to control the crowd.\nSome police patrolled the streets on horseback while others with riot gear lined up behind Guard troops deployed to protect federal facilities including a detention center where some immigrants were taken in recent days. Police declared an unlawful assembly, and by early evening many people had left.\nBut protesters who remained grabbed chairs from a nearby public park to form a makeshift barrier, throwing objects at police on the other side. Others standing above the closed southbound 101 Freeway threw chunks of concrete, rocks, electric scooters and fireworks at California Highway Patrol officers and their vehicles that were parked on the highway. Officers ran under an overpass to take cover.\nIt was the third day of demonstrations against Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown in the region, as the arrival of around 300 federal troops spurred anger and fear among some residents. Sunday\u2019s protests in Los Angeles, a city of 4 million people, were centered in several blocks of downtown.\nStarting in the morning, National Guard troops stood shoulder to shoulder, carrying long guns and riot shields outside the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles. Protesters shouted \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cgo home.\u201d After some closely approached the guard members, another set of uniformed officers advanced on the group, shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street.\nMinutes later, the Los Angeles Police Department fired rounds of crowd-control munitions to disperse the protesters, who they said were assembled unlawfully. Much of the group then moved to block traffic on the 101 freeway until state patrol officers cleared them from the roadway by late afternoon, while southbound lanes remained shut down.\nNearby, at least four self-driving Waymo cars were set on fire, sending large plumes of black smoke into the sky and exploding intermittently as the electric vehicles burned. By evening, police had issued an unlawful assembly order shutting down several blocks of downtown Los Angeles.\nFlash bangs echoed out every few seconds into the evening.\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom requested Trump remove the guard members in a letter Sunday afternoon, calling their deployment a \u201cserious breach of state sovereignty.\u201d He was in Los Angeles meeting with local law enforcement and officials. It wasn\u2019t clear if he\u2019d spoken to Trump since Friday.\nTheir deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state\u2019s national guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration\u2019s mass deportation efforts.\nMayor Karen Bass echoed Newsom\u2019s comments.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in Los Angeles is chaos that is provoked by the administration,\u201d she said in an afternoon press conference. \u201cThis is about another agenda, this isn\u2019t about public safety.\u201d\nTheir admonishments did not deter the administration.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bald-faced lie for Newsom to claim there was no problem in Los Angeles before President Trump got involved,\u201d White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement in response.\nDeployment follows days of protest\nThe arrival of the National Guard followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighboring Compton.\nFederal agents arrested immigrants in LA\u2019s fashion district, in a Home Depot parking lot and at several other locations on Friday. The next day, they were staging at a Department of Homeland Security office near another Home Depot in Paramount, which drew out protesters who suspected another raid. Federal authorities later said there was no enforcement activity at that Home Depot.\nDemonstrators attempted to block Border Patrol vehicles by hurling rocks and chunks of cement. In response, agents in riot gear unleashed tear gas, flash-bang explosives and pepper balls.\nThe weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the LA area climbed above 100, federal authorities said. Many more were arrested while protesting, including a prominent union leader who was accused of impeding law enforcement.\nThe protests did not reach the size of past demonstrations that brought the National Guard to Los Angeles, including the Watts and Rodney King riots, and the 2020 protests against police violence, in which Newsom requested the assistance of federal troops.\nThe last time the National Guard was activated without a governor\u2019s permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters as he prepared to board Air Force One in Morristown, New Jersey, Sunday that there were \u201cviolent people\u201d in Los Angeles \u201cand they\u2019re not gonna get away with it.\u201d\nTrump says there will be \u2018very strong law and order\u2019\nIn a directive Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is \u201da rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.\u201d\nHe said he had authorized the deployment of 2,000 members of the National Guard.\nTrump told reporters as he prepared to board Air Force One in Morristown, New Jersey, Sunday that there were \u201cviolent people\u201d in Los Angeles \u201cand they\u2019re not gonna get away with it.\u201d\nAsked if he planned to send U.S. troops to Los Angeles, Trump replied: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have troops everywhere. We\u2019re not going to let this happen to our country. We\u2019re not going to let our country be torn apart like it was under Biden.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate.\nAbout 500 Marines stationed at Twentynine Palms, about 125 miles (200 kilometers) east of Los Angeles were in a \u201cprepared to deploy status\u201d Sunday afternoon, according to the U.S. Northern Command.\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris, who lives in Los Angeles, said the immigration arrests and Guard deployment were designed as part of a \u201ccruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division.\u201d\nShe said she supports those \u201cstanding up to protect our most fundamental rights and freedoms.\u201d\n___\nOffenhartz reported from New York.

  "argos_summary": "President Donald Trump has taken control of Washington D.C.'s law enforcement and deployed National Guard troops, claiming a public safety emergency despite local officials asserting that crime rates are actually falling. His rhetoric has drawn parallels to historical narratives used to justify federal intervention in predominantly non-white cities, raising concerns among residents about local agency and civil rights violations. Critics argue that Trump's portrayal of D.C. as crime-ridden is exaggerated, with statistics showing significant decreases in violent crime, while local leaders emphasize the need for community-focused solutions rather than heavy-handed federal tactics.",
